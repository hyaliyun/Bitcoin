The nylon rope trick typically makes use of a water solution of an aliphatic diamine with a solution of an aliphatic diacid chloride in a solvent that does not dissolve in water, yielding a synthetic polyamide of the nylon-type. Nylon 610 is commonly used, in which hexamethylene diamine is dissolved in water to a concentration of about 0.40 moles / deciliter. A solution of sebacoyl chloride in cyclohexane (0.15 moles / deciliter concentration) is then layered on top of the water solution, the reaction typically being conducted in a beaker. The solution is not agitated; instead the nylon 610 polymer forms as a flexible film at the interface of the water and cyclohexane layers, in an example of an interfacial polymerization. The experimentalist grasps the polymer film, withdrawing it from the reaction vessel, forming a filament or rope, and collecting it on a rotating rod above the reaction vessel. New polymer forms at the interface as fresh surfaces of the cyclohexane layer and the water layer form. In this way, the demonstration yields a continuous rope that is collected on the rotating rod. Nylon 66 can also be produced at laboratory scale in this way. Representative procedures and equipment lists for conducting the nylon rope trick demonstration are available in literature procedures. The nylon rope trick was developed as a scientific demonstration by American chemist Stephanie Kwolek, who later invented Kevlar aramid.

French, of the Quartermaster's Department: > Leaving the Pecos, the [San Antonio-El Paso] road turns directly to the > west, up a wide valley or plain, with hills in broken ridges on both sides. > As the distance increases, the soil becomes more and more sterile, without > grass, and yielding support to nothing but dwarf bushes, Spanish bayonets, > and stunted cactus. Continuing over a gently-swelling hill, another valley > is entered, following which about six miles, water is found in ponds, some > of them quite deep, surrounded by a tall growth of rushes and cane. The > water rises from a rocky bottom, and, as it imperceptibly glides away, gives > life and freshness to the coarse grass and cane. This water is distant from > the Pecos about eighteen miles, and has been called Escondido creek. The > grazing is not good, and wood for fuel is scarce. Eight miles further on are > the Escondido springs. The water gushes out from beneath a shelf of rocks, > and flows some distance down the creek. The country around is rocky and > barren, covered with chaparral and prickly pear. The grazing is limited, and > wood by no means plenty.Reports of the Secretary of War: With > Reconnaissances of Routes from San Antonio to El Paso, United States. Army. > Corps of Topographical Engineers, Printed at the Union office, Washington, > 1850 On July 13, 1857, Edward Fitzgerald Beale described it: > Started at 4 a m. and travelled over an almost level country until we came > to the Escondido spring. This water is beautifully clear, though slightly > brackish. There is sufficient grass here, but of a coarse innutritious > quality.

Numerically superior Habsburg Austrian, British and Hanoverian columns converged on the fortified French camp but Kilmaine wisely decided to slip away toward Arras. The War of the First Coalition skirmish was fought near the village of Marquion located northwest of Cambrai, France. On 16 July 1793, Adam Philippe, Comte de Custine commander of the Army of the North was ordered to Paris where he was soon arrested and guillotined. Kilmaine was requested to lead the army until a permanent replacement arrived. On 6 August two Austrian columns set out to turn the French right flank while a British and Hanoverian column under Prince Frederick, Duke of York and Albany marched completely behind the French army. Though one representative on mission urged Kilmaine to attack, the general determined to escape to the west. On the 7th, the Coalition trap snapped shut on only two battalions and even these got away when Kilmaine intervened with his massed cavalry. Kilmaine was dismissed and later arrested, though he avoided the guillotine and served in Italy under Napoleon Bonaparte in 1796.

It took the club just 14 years to progress from the 9th tier to the 3rd. AFC Wimbledon is an English professional association football club, based in Wimbledon, Greater London. The club was formed on 30 May 2002 by a group of supporters of Wimbledon Football Club, led by Kris Stewart, Marc Jones and Trevor Williams who strongly opposed the decision of an independent commission appointed by the FA to allow the relocation of Wimbledon F.C. to Milton Keynes, who were subsequently reformed as Milton Keynes Dons in 2004. AFC Wimbledon was accepted into the Premier Division of the Combined Counties League for the 2002-03 season. The club's average home attendance at league fixtures for their first season exceeded 3,000 – higher than the average attendance in the same season of Wimbledon F.C., who were still playing in the First Division (now the EFL Championship). AFC Wimbledon have also broken the record for the longest run of unbeaten league games at any level of senior football in the United Kingdom. The club remained unbeaten for 78 league matches between 26 February 2003 (a 3–1 away win at Chessington United) and 27 November 2004 (a 2–1 away win at Bashley). The club went on to achieve 5 promotions in 9 years, ensuring that they were the first club to be formed in the 21st century to make it into the Football League and making them the youngest of the 72 Football League clubs by some distance. On 30 May 2016, AFC Wimbledon achieved their 6th promotion to Football League One after victory in the 2016 Football League Two play-off Final, exactly 14 years to the day since the club's formation. To date, AFC Wimbledon has played more than 700 league fixtures against 157 opponents, maintaining an unbeaten winning record against 42 of them (namely Ash United, Ashford Town (Kent), Ashford Town (Middlesex), Banstead Athletic, Basingstoke Town, Bedfont, Bishop's Stortford, Bognor Regis Town, Burgess Hill Town, Carshalton Athletic, Chessington United, Chessington & Hook United, Cobham, Cove, Croydon, Dorking, Dulwich Hamlet, Fisher Athletic , Fleet Town, Frimley Green, Godalming & Guildford, Histon, Horley Town, Maidenhead United, Maidstone United, Maldon Town, Merstham, Molesey, Newport (Isle of Wight), North Greenford United, Notts County, Raynes Park Vale, Redbridge, Salisbury City, Sandhurst Town, Southport, Team Bath, Thurrock, Viking Greenford, AFC Wallingford, Walton Casuals and Westfield (Surrey)).

Ashford Town went to administration at the end of 2010, having been suspended from competitive football on account of failure to pay loan fees of more than £2,000 to Ebbsfleet United. The club were believed to have debts over £500,000 when faced with a winding-up order by HM Revenue and Customs. When the club eventually folded, former Ashford Town Director Tony Betteridge subsequently reformed the club as Ashford United in 2011, which became a founding member of the Kent Invicta Football League. :B. Bedfont folded in May 2010 after informing the Combined Counties League that they would be unable to participate the following season on account of financial difficulties. In May 2012 the club merged with Feltham in order to form Bedfont & Feltham, which joined the Combined Counties League Division One for the 2013/14 season. :C. Chessington United merged with Predators and Fetcham Park United in the summer of 2005, to form Mole Valley Predators. The club competed in the Combined Counties League during the 2005/06 season, but subsequently resigned and disbanded in the summer of 2006. :D. Chester City were expelled from the Conference National on 26 February 2010 for failing to pay off debts believed to be more than £200,000, having already received a 25-point deduction. As a result of this expulsion, Chester City were unable to fulfill their remaining fixtures of the season, meaning that the reverse fixture against AFC Wimbledon (scheduled for 17 April 2010) was never played. On 8 March 2010, it was announced that Chester City would have their league record (P28 W5 D7 L16 GF23 GA42 Pts–3) expunged. On 10 March 2010 the 126-year-old club was officially wound up at a High Court hearing in London. :E. Croydon Athletic were handed a £7,500 fine and a 10-point deduction after a case of financial irregularities was proven on 8 December 2011. A Football Association statement confirmed that the Isthmian League Premier Division club had been charged with 24 breaches of FA Rule E1(b) regarding the payment of players under written contract in relation to the 2009/10 season. All players and management resigned amidst the scandal, leaving the club unable to fulfill a league match against Ramsgate on 10 December 2011. The club was officially wound up on 18 December 2011 after a new buyer could not be found to pay off the club's £100,000 debt. A new club, dubbed AFC Croydon Athletic was subsequently reformed by fans, joining the Combined Counties League Division One for the 2012/13 season. :F. Darlington went into administration for the third time in their history on 3 January 2011, with owner Raj Singh stating ongoing financial losses as the reason for his deciding to end his involvement with the club. The club was handed an automatic 10-point deduction and informed that they could be relegated from the Conference National at the end of the 2011/12 season unless they were able to pay their creditors in full. On 18 January 2012, the club was only saved from immediate liquidation thanks to a last-minute injection of £50,000 worth of funding from supporter's group \\"Darlington FC 1883 Ltd.\\" Administrators gave the fans group until 30 April to raise the £750,000 they need to buy the club. Darlington FC 1883 Ltd. purchased some of the assets of Darlington from Administrators on 3 May 2012. Despite the best efforts of supporters, however, the club failed to pay off its debts in the allocated time, and were subsequently relegated four divisions, to the Northern League Division One, on the recommendation of The Football Association. In line with its policy of not allowing clubs that go into administration to continue without paying debts, The Football Association decree that when a creditors voluntary agreement (CVA) is not agreed and a club has to be liquidated, then that club cannot continue to operate under its original name. Hence, the club was subsequently reformed by supporters as Darlington 1883 following the demise of the 129-year-old Darlington on 21 June 2012. :G. Feltham agreed to merge with Bedfont in May 2012 in order to form Bedfont & Feltham. However, as Feltham had already registered to compete in the FA Vase and Combined Counties League Division One for the 2012/13 season, it wasn't until the following season that the two clubs were able to amalgamate fully. Bedfont & Feltham competed in the Combined Counties League Division One for the 2013/14 season. :H. Fisher Athletic were officially wound up at a High Court hearing in London on 13 May 2009 after failing to pay off substantial debts. The winding-up order for unpaid income tax had officially been handed down on 13 March 2009, adjourned for 49 days until 22 April, and then adjourned for a further 21 days to 13 May 2009. It transpired that the club hadn’t been paying players since November 2008. On 28 May 2009, a supporters trust was formed to help create a new club, dubbed Fisher which would compete in the Kent Football League Premier Division in the 2009/10 season. :I. Godalming & Guilford opted to revert to their original name of Godalming Town at the end of the 2004/05 season. The club registered to competed in the Combined Counties League Premier Division during the 2005/06 season. :J. Hereford United were expelled from the Conference National on 10 June 2014 due to financial irregularities. It was revealed a week later that the club's debts ran as high as £1,300,000. The club was accepted into the Southern League Premier Division for the 2014/15 season on 19 June 2014. On 10 December 2014, after failing to fully and properly comply with obligations to respond to questions coming from an Independent Regulatory Commission, the FA suspended Hereford United from all forms of football activity with immediate effect, until the order of the Independent Regulatory Commission was complied with to the full satisfaction of the Commission. The club was wound-up in the High Court in December 2014. Following the winding up of Hereford United on 19 December 2014, the Hereford United Supporters Trust (HUST) vowed to start a new phoenix club. On 22 December 2014, Hereford was unveiled. :K. Leyton were suspended from the Isthmian League Premier Division on 14 January 2011 due to non-payment of a £700 debt on league subscriptions. The Club Chairmen and Secretary then resigned, followed by the team management and players upon learning of the disastrous state of the club's finances. Unable to continue playing first team football, the club's remaining director, Louise Sophocleous, was forced to withdraw Leyton from the league and what remained of the club was disbanded. :L. In September 2009, Maldon Town were taken over by Tiptree United chairman Ed Garty in a move which saw both clubs form under a single umbrella of control. Maldon boss Stuart Nethercott was removed as manager and Tiptree manager Colin Wallington took his place. Both teams would play from Maldon's Park Drive ground while both teams completed their respective seasons. It was announced in April 2010 that Maldon Town would be rebranded as Maldon & Tiptree, with Tiptree United withdrawing from the Essex Senior League. In an effort preserve Tiptree United's name and history, the club were incorporated into Maldon Town, while a new blue and red striped kit was revealed ahead of the 2010–11 season. :M. Rushden & Diamonds were expelled from the Conference National on 11 June 2011. This decision was made due to their unstable financial position, meaning they could not guarantee being able to complete all their fixtures in the 2011–12 season. The club faced a winding up petition on behalf of HMRC in the week commencing 13 June 2011, with reported debts of £750,000. The club subsequently tried to register as a member of the Southern Football League but also failed to convince officials that they would be able to fulfill their fixtures list, ultimately entering administration on 7 July 2011. Fans announced their desire to create a new fan-owned club called AFC Rushden & Diamonds that would go on to compete in the United Counties Football League Division One for the 2012–13 season, having missed the FA deadline for registration for the 2011-12 season. :N. Salisbury City were demoted to the Conference South on 13 June 2014 after missing a deadline to clear outstanding debts, believed to be in the region of £150,000. On 18 September 2014, the club was placed into administration after an application through creditors was granted by the High Court. On 4 December 2014, however, a new company under the name of Salisbury FC Ltd was incorporated and created by a consortium of five (David Phillips, Ian Ridley, Jeremy Harwood, Graeme Mundy, and Steve Claridge). After buying the remaining assets of predecessor club Salisbury City from the administrators, they started the task of creating a football club from scratch. In May 2015, the FA placed Salisbury in the Wessex League Premier Division. :O. On 9 April 2009, Team Bath announced their withdrawal from the Conference South after the Football Conference notified the club that as they were not a limited company, but rather an affiliation to the University of Bath, that they would be henceforth ineligible for further promotions and would no longer be allowed to compete in the FA Cup. The club opted to resign from the Conference at the end of the season rather than restructure. :P. Viking Greenford competed in the Combined Counties League Premier Division but folded at the end of the 2002-03 season after finishing bottom of the league with a lack of future financial backing. :Q. AFC Wallingford had a change of name to Wallingford Town in 2013. :R. Windsor & Eton were officially wound-up by the High Court on 3 February 2011 due to an unpaid tax bill of £240,000. The fans had a strong desire to ensure that football would be continued to play in Windsor, however, and the following day a new company dubbed WFC Football Community Development Ltd was created with the aim of achieving that objective. A new club, Windsor, joined the Combined Counties League Premier Division for the 2011-12 season. :S. Despite finishing as Champions of the 2002-03 Combined Counties League Premier Division, Withdean 2000 were denied promotion to the Isthmian League as their playing facilities were deemed to be inadequate, and in the close season of 2003 their wealthy backer Alan Pook and many of the best players left for then Isthmian League team Worthing. The following season was a year of struggle with the club finishing 21st in the league. Being unable to finance their existence any longer, the club folded at the end of the 2003-04 season.

Dickinson spoke at the event, referencing Planned Parenthood founder Margaret Sanger. According to a document distributed by the group, Dickinson and the other signees believed that “the targeted practices of Alabama abortion providers are both discriminatory and disproportionately harmful to black mothers and their babies” and that a legal case could be made against abortion using the Tenth Amendment.

Digital intra-oral impressions made using intra-oral cameras are able to recreate the positive impression of a patient's dentition and other structures into a digital format on a computer almost instantly. = Enhancements =  Colour Matching  Traditionally dentists will use a physical shade guide in the dental surgery as they compare the patient's teeth to the shades in the guide, all done while the patient is in the chair. Newer computer matching techniques allow for a more superior than matching methods currently used. There is always differences in perception when it comes to the human eye and observation. This was proved in a study which found that there was a high statistical correlation between a spectrophotometer and the digital camera used. Now used in some dental surgeries it can improve dental-laboratory communication.  CAD/CAM in dentistry = CAD/CAM used with intra-oral scanning = Two studies investigated the accuracy of both direct an indirect digitized impressions used to make clinically acceptable zirconia crowns. It was shown that a significantly smaller marginal fit was observed when compared to traditional methods of casting, a more accurate marginal and internal fit. The efficiency and fit of fully ceramic restorations fabricated through CAD/CAM were evaluated through a double-blinded randomized clinical trial. Direct digitized impressions were taken straight from the patients mouths and indirect digitized impression taken from already made impressions. The digitized impressions were then used to create CAD/CAM milled all-ceramic crowns. Between the direct and indirect, the direct digital impression technique was statistically more accurate, they showed significantly better inter-proximal contact. The entire process proved to be more time efficient for both the dentist and patient in comparison with conventional methods or taking impressions with silicone impressions and sending them to a lab.  Use of dental technology in other areas of dentistry  Within the dental profession there are already uses for digital dentistry and as technology continues to develop, proposed uses for the futures. Some examples are outlined below; = Digital Orthodontics = Digital technology has significantly changed the filed of orthodontics. Specifically, digital technology and in particular 3D printing majorly improved clear aligner therapy in orthodontics. = Diagnosis of caries = Caries disease process results in structural changes to the dental hard tissue. The diffusion of ions out of the tooth, known as the demineralisation process, will result in loss of mineral content. The resulting region will be filled mainly by bacteria and water. This region will have greater porosity than the surrounding tissue, which results in a distinct change in the optical properties of the affected dental tissue, providing evidence of caries-induced change. Optically based methods detect caries on changes in the specific optical properties. Quantitative light-induced fluorescence – Changes in enamel fluorescence can be detected and measured when the tooth is illuminated by violet-blue light from a camera hand piece. The image is saved and processed. The end product is an image which gives a measure of the extent and severity of the lesion. = Occlusion and TMJ analysis =  Virtual and Augmented Reality  Virtual Reality (VR) is a computer-generated simulation which allows for interactive experience, it fully recreates the environment for which the simulation that is ran. Augmented Reality (AR) may be considered a form of virtual reality and is a way of interacting with the real world through a simulation. The objects and individuals are augmented due to them being computer-generated, but are perceived in the real world through a camera onto a screen. Simulations produced by augmented reality can take on the reason for training activities by using technologically-synthesised features which are able to mimic real life situations. These can be used throughout the career timeline of a profession, from undergraduate students, specialised and training days. VR and AR systems are becoming more common in dental education. They will continue to change clinical training and encourage more receptive ways of processing individual learning needs and self-directed learning. Pedagogical tools such as these are said to lower the costs of the educational process while increasing the quality. Limitations Limitations on digital dentistry include cost, lack of desire to adapt to new dental technology, and misunderstanding of new technologies.Digital dentistry: Is this the future of dentistry?- Dental Economics  The future  As digital dentistry continues to adapt and becomes more common, the approach to incorporating the topic of digital dentistry in learning outcomes during dental training must also change. As we enter 'the digital age of dental education', future practitioners need to be exposed to new digital procedures in the curriculum and teaching. In an article titled \\"Digital Teaching and Digital Medicine: A national initiative is needed\\", it is suggested that faculties and ministries should be the ones to encourage integration of digital teaching into the education of future physicians and students and the learning of digital technologies which are up to date and relevant.

Early life and military service Born in 1931 in Launceston, Tasmania, Wrigley joined the Government Aircraft Factories (GAF) in Melbourne as a cadet engineer in 1950, and later became an aeronautical engineer. In 1975, he joined the Department of Defence as an Assistant Secretary, was promoted to First Assistant Secretary in 1981, and Deputy Secretary under Bill Pritchett in 1982.Who's Who in Australia, ConnectWeb, 2014. Director-General of Security On 29 July 1985, Wrigley was appointed as Director-General of ASIO. As Director-General, Wrigley implemented several rigorous reforms to the agency, continuing a trend begun under the directorship of Sir Edward Woodward by further reducing the level of specialisation and increasing generalisation. He also oversaw the moving of ASIO's headquarters from Melbourne to Canberra in 1986. A number of experienced officers resigned from ASIO after Wrigley abolished benefits and allowances for senior officers moving to Canberra, which had been negotiated with the Hawke Government under his predecessor Harvey Barnett. After ASIO Wrigley's term as Director-General was to expire at the end of July 1988 but he was appointed, without discussion, to another three-year term by Bob Hawke's cabinet — although the Canberra Times speculated he would not see out the term as he was rumoured to be considering another position with the Department of Industry, Technology and Commerce. Indeed, Wrigley resigned from ASIO on 7 October 1988 to act as a special advisor to the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce (Senator John Button) on the planned Multifunction Polis project until 31 December 1990. In 1990, Wrigley authored a report for the Department of Defence entitled The Defence Force and the Community: A Partnership in Australia's Defence (also known as 'The Wrigley Report'), which resulted in the creation of the Commercial Support Program (CSP) and ultimately saw the market testing and transfer of around 10,000 uniformed and civilian positions in Defence to the private sector.

She fulfils all the wishes of people who pray to her. History A long time ago, a Hindu Brahman who worshiped in Kolkata saw some children play with a round shaped stone under a Tentuli tree. The children worshiped that stone. That man saw the stone properly and felt that stone must not be a simple one. He spoke of it to another person who lived nearer to that tree.

He has constructed seventeen fiberglass pyramids throughout Russia, the tallest at a height of 132 feet. View of Golod's largest pyramid He believes that the ancient Egyptians had knowledge of this power and that it was the motivation, at least in part, for their building the Great Pyramids of Giza. Pyramid research Many paranormal researchers and writers have long speculated about the potential energy properties of pyramid structures. Many theories are prevalent in the research, with writers believing pyramids to have several beneficial properties. Golod's research has been done whilst coordinating a team of scientists. The Russian Academy of Medical Sciences supports his research. Golod has constructed over twenty pyramids across Russia and former Soviet satellites out of fiberglass and other materials. The largest of these structures is 44 meters high and weighs roughly 55 tons. Golod believes that the pyramid shape channels Earth's magnetic fields and creates positive energy fields that can be harnessed and controlled for man's use. Inside the largest he has placed a number of benches and large globes – geographical, topographical, and astronomical - for tourists to enjoy. Among the many benefits Golod has claimed is a cause of these pyramids are: * A boost in immune system strength in fighting pathogens;. He has claimed that persons who enter the pyramid “will not become ill with cancer, AIDS, Alzheimers disease, or other sicknesses.” * Medicines becoming more effective after exposure to the pyramids; * Greater crop yield to seeds exposed to the pyramids; * Presence of an ion column that reportedly repairs Ozone layer; * Effects of radioactivity are lessened; *Cure impotence; *Moderate weather. Golod also reported held an experiment on prisoners in which they were fed food that had been exposed to the pyramid. The prison reported that acts of violence diminished significantly. Russian astronauts were also reported to have taken objects and water from the pyramid on board the International Space Station to keep themselves healthy. He has also stated “If you put some cheap wine in here, it becomes superior to the finest vintage”. Athletes are reported to visit the pyramid to receive a boost of energy and strength from its powers. Tourists come from all around the former Soviet states, as well as globally, to see the pyramids, which can be visited free of charge. Golod earns revenues through merchandise reportedly “energized” by the pyramid, including crystals and bottled water. In addition, it is common for weddings and other special events to be held within. A number of tourists have claimed they experienced positive results after visiting the pyramid. Success stories range from barren women being able to conceive after exposure, to the ozone layer above Russia being repaired. Criticisms Many Russian doctors and scientists have claimed that the effects are likely psychological when someone enters the pyramid and expects to feel better. Many believe the pyramids are simply a tourist gimmick. There is no scientific consensus on the plausibility of Golod's research. Critics also state empirical evidence is lacking to prove that the pyramids are the actual cause of any healing or other benefits. Mainstream scientists, especially in the west, do not accept his theories due a substantial lack of published scientific evidence, with Golod relying heavily on observational inference. There are also a number of tourists who do not share the same enthusiasm as others, claiming that they experienced no changes whatsoever from exposure to the pyramid. Those with ailments did not recover or feel any better. In one case, after hearing of the greater crop yield, one farmer brought his seeds to the pyramid, only to yield a worse crop than the previous season. Personal life Golod and his family live near one of the pyramids he has constructed. He is married with children and grandsons.

Volodymyr Hill over Dnieper. Rise of Hrushevskoho Street (Pecherskyi District) Kyiv Mountains or Kyiv Hills () is a term used in journalism and literature for hills and highlands around the city of Kyiv that range from approximately 150 to almost 200 meters. The city of Kyiv is located within borders of three orographic regions: Dnieper Upland (Cisdnieper Upland) and Polesian and Dnieper lowlands. The hills are located in northern part of the Kyiv plateau where the Dnieper Upland slopes down towards the Dnieper river valley and the Kyiv Polesia. The highest marks recorded in central and southwestern parts of the city (within the Dnieper Upland, particularly the Kyiv plateau). Hilly landscape is the reason for the unusual depths and two-fold escalators of underground Kyiv Metro (subway) stations in the city center (with the deepest one, Arsenalna, measuring 105.5 metres). Kyiv plateau The Kyiv plateau as a geologic creation presents itself as a rolling meadow plain dissected with ravines and gulches. According to the physiographic categorization the given territory is part of the Obukhiv-Vasylkiv section of forest steppe. The plateau stretches along the right bank of Dnieper from Kyiv to Kaniv where a complex of other hills compose a landscape feature known as Kaniv Mountains. At the heart of the upland lay Jurassic, Cretaceous, Paleogene, Neogene and Quaternary deposits that are covered with a thick layer of loess on which formed gray and lightly gray limed silt of light loam. Creation of the loess hills of Dnieper region is connected with withdrawal of the last Great Sea basin, the Kharkiv Sea. General description =Pechersk and vicinity= The highest elevation of the Kyiv Mountains is an upland that corresponds to historic city neighborhood Pechersk (Caves). Sometimes it is referred to as Pechersk Hills or Pechersk Elevation. The highest elevated location of the upland is situated at Lypky and known as Levashov Hill (after the General Governor Vasiliy Levashov). Its maximum height is . The same height is also recorded at a small area near the Kyiv Metro station Arsenalna. Somewhat lower marks are in front of the Verkhovna Rada building (Constitution Square) - . Considering that the absolute water level in Dnieper is recorded at , the upland rises over the river some 100 meters. To the south and down of the Dnieper stream flow is located the Bous Hill or Bousovytsia. Today there is the Hryshko National Botanic Garden. The highest point of the hill () is southeast of the botanic garden entrance. Beside the Bous Field, at the north of the hill lays Zvirynets neighborhood that is more famous therefore the whole area sometimes is called \\"Zvirynets\\". To the Pechersk Hills is adjacent the Cherepanov Hill, the height of which is . On the hill were erected Hospital fortifications of the Kyiv Fortress and the Military Hospital, while at the northwestern foot of the hill is located the Olimpiyskiy National Sports Complex. =Old Kyiv and vicinity= Practically of the same height () is the Old Kyiv Hill (Starokyivska) and its northeastern portion, the St.Michael's Hill (Mykhailivska). Before they were separated by a ravine that stretched across the St.Michael's Square and Kyiv Funicular. On the eastern rise of the St.Michael's Hill is located a park, Volodymyr Hill, the name of which derived from the monument to St.Volodymyr located in it. A little bit lower is the northern side of the Old Kyiv Hill, Dytynets, . There in place of the Kyi Fort is located the National Museum of History of Ukraine. Beyond the Andrew's Descent is the Old Kyiv's spur, St. Andrew's Hill (Andriyivska) which is in height. Before, the St.Andrew's Hill was connected with the Castle Hill, but the Andrew's Descent divided them. The hill's name was left after it when in 1749-54 here was erected the St Andrew's Church. Somewhat down the descent from the \\"Richard's Castle\\", one may notice another hill, Uzdykhalnytsia. Some consider it a separate hill, others - a part of the St.Andrew's Hill. To the west of Dytynets, there is a smaller hill, Dytynka, that is located between old neighborhoods of Dehtyari (Tarboilers), Honchari (Potters), and Kozhumyaki (Tanners). High is also an area adjacent to the Old Kyiv Hill from the south where is located Sofia Square. Its height reaches there . To the northwest of Old Kyiv is located the Castle Hill (Zamkova Hora), the highest point of which reaches . The hill is little bit elongated with depression.

Most of the mills are part of the village of Kinderdijk in the municipality of Molenwaard, and one mill, De Blokker, is part of the municipality of Alblasserdam. Built in 1738 and 1740, to keep water out of the polder, it is the largest concentration of old windmills in the Netherlands and one of the best-known Dutch tourist sites. The mills are listed as national monuments and the entire area is a protected village view since 1993. They have been a UNESCO World Heritage Site since 1997.  History  Kinderdijk lies in the Alblasserwaard, at the confluence of the Lek and Noord rivers. In Alblasserwaard, problems with water became more and more apparent in the 13th century. Large canals, called \\"weteringen\\", were dug to get rid of the excess water in the polders. However, the drained soil started setting, while the level of the river rose due to the river's sand deposits. Most of the current mills were built in 1738 and 1740 (see below). After a few centuries, an additional way to keep the polders dry was required. It was decided to build a series of windmills, with a limited capacity to bridge water level differences, but just able to pump water into a reservoir at an intermediate level between the soil in the polder and the river; the reservoir could be let out into the river through locks whenever the river level was low enough; the river level has both seasonal and tidal variations. Although some of the windmills are still used, the main water works are provided by two diesel pumping stations near one of the entrances of the windmills site. Windmills at Kinderdijk  Description  Nederwaard Mill No.2 The 19 stone mills of the Netherlands were built in 1738, the wooden mills of the Overwaard in 1740. The former move the drainage water from the lower polders of the Alblasserwaard into a reservoir, the latter that from the higher polders. Both reservoirs used to drain in turn into the river Lek by means of locks during low river water levels; nowadays modern pumping stations are in place. = List of windmills = Nederwaard Mill No.6 pumping water from one canal to the next This is a list of the 19 mill: ;De Nederwaard * Nederwaard Molen No.1 * Nederwaard Molen No.2 * Nederwaard Molen No.3 * Nederwaard Molen No.4 * Nederwaard Molen No.5 * Nederwaard Molen No.6 * Nederwaard Molen No.7 * Nederwaard Molen No.8 ;De Overwaard * Overwaard Molen No.1 * Overwaard Molen No.2 * Overwaard Molen No.3 * Overwaard Molen No.4 * Overwaard Molen No.5 * Overwaard Molen No.6 * Overwaard Molen No.7 * Overwaard Molen No.8 ;Nieuw- Lekkerland * De Hoge Molen * Kleine of Lage Molen ;Alblasserdam * De Blokker  Modern day  The 1/25 scale miniature windmills of Kinderdijk (left) and Zaanse Schans B (right) in Tobu World Square, Japan.

It was published on 1 February 2014 by Atria Books. The book has been praised by Melissa Harris-Perry, bell hooks, Laverne Cox, and Barbara Smith. It debuted in 19th position on The New York Times Best Seller list for Hardcover Nonfiction. The book's original title was Fish Food. The memoir follows Mock's journey as a transgender girl and young woman in Hawaii.  Summary  In Redefining Realness, Janet Mock describes her life as a transgender woman from childhood to adulthood. Mock opens the book with a scene from 2009, where she starts to tell her boyfriend Aaron that she is transgender and then starts telling her story from childhood. = Part One = In 1989, as children, Mock's friend and neighbor Marylin dares Mock to take her grandmother's dress down from the clothesline and put it on. After being caught, Mock is scolded by her grandmother and mother for wearing a dress. At four years old, Mock discovers that her father is cheating on her mother. Her parents eventually split up and at age seven Mock is sent to live with her father and brother, Chad, in Oakland, California. While there, her father tries to instill masculinity into young Mock, pushing her to participate in sports and other activities that her brother enjoys. Mock's father gets a new girlfriend, and that girlfriend's son, a boy much older than Mock, molests her. In 1992, Mock discovers her father smoking crack cocaine in her bedroom. At this moment she loses respect for her father. In 1994, Mock's father moves the three of them to Dallas, where the father's family lives. While in Dallas, Mock begins participating in more feminine activities with her aunts. When her father moves them into an apartment with his new girlfriend, Denise, Mock connects with her daughter, Makayla. Mock adopts a pseudonym, Keisha, and chats with boyfriends Makayla is no longer interested with over the phone as Keisha. Once, while at her aunt's apartment, one of the boys she had been meeting up with a Keisha comes looking for her. After the boy addresses Mock as Keisha in front of her father, Mock's father cuts her hair short to make her more masculine. Mock's mother eventually decides to bring Mock and her brother Chad back to Hawaii to live with her. = Part Two = Mock, Chad, and their younger brother Jeff lived with their older sister Cori and her children. While in school in Hawaii, Mock meets Wendi, another transgender girl. Through her friendship with Wendi, Mock becomes more confident, dresses more feminine, and has access to estrogen pills. At age thirteen, Mock comes out as gay to her mother, and Wendi helps her become even more feminine. Together, they meet other transgender women and drag queens. Mock's mother gets back together with Cori's father, her boyfriend from high school, named Rick. Mock attends Moanalua High School, a rigorous school. She joins the volleyball team, and becomes more confident in her femininity. She continues to meet up with Wendi, who develops a passion for makeup. = Part Three = Mock becomes class treasurer at Moanalua. After taking estrogen in secret, she talks to her family to come out as a woman and ask to be called Janet. She repeatedly gets sent home from school for breaking the dress code by wearing skirts. She graduates from estrogen pills to shots, which she pays for in cash. She meets a boy named Adrian, who shows interest in her but rejects her when he discovers she is transgender. After Rick gets arrested, Mock and her brothers, mother, and Rick move into a hotel room. After hanging around with Wendi and other transgender women, Mock enters the sex industry. She makes enough money that she can pay for her own hormone therapy. Later, Rick gets arrested again, and Mock's mother moves back in with Cori. Because of the transphobia she faces at Moanalua, Mock transfers to Farrington, the school where her brother and Wendi attend. At Farrington, there is a Teen Center and a transgender support group called Chrysalis that provides resources to transgender girls. Mock comes out to her father via a letter. Mock decides she wants to undergo genital reconstructive surgery and gets an after-school job at a clothing store to save money. Mock receives a scholarship to the University of Hawai'i at Manoa. She schedules a date for a GRS procedure in Thailand for December 20, 2001. Mock continues to work in the sex trade on Merchant Street with strict rules on what acts she will perform and for whom. She starts college at the University of Hawai'i. When she pays her mother $120 dollars for their electric bill, her mother and Chad realize how she is getting the money but say nothing. As adults, Chad tells Mock how worried he was for her. Mock is picked up on Merchant Street by a man in a van, someone she would never agree to be with under normal circumstances, but he offers her so much money, and it is so close to her GRS date, that she gets into his van. The man steals her purse and, when the other women on the street help her call the police, the officers are unhelpful. She calls a regular, Sam, to come pick her up and let her sleep in his apartment for the night. Sam offers to pay for her GRS, Mock declines, but asks him about the nude modeling her photographs for. Mock poses for a photographer, Felix, in lingerie. This is, she says, the decision she regrets most. She gets $1500 for two modeling sessions. Mock goes to Bangkok, Thailand for GRS. Dr. R. and Dr. C. perform the surgery. In recovery, Mock meets an older transgender Australian woman, Genie, Mock returns to Hawaii on December 28 and her mother embraces her tearfully. While recovering, her mother takes care of her. Mock accepts her mothers faults and the family is loving.  2009  Returning to 2009, having told her story to Aaron, Mock waits for a reaction. Their relationship is inconsistent for a while, and Mock makes a new friend in Mia, the woman who hired her for a People magazine job. Mock comes out to Mia as transgender. After eight months of no contact from Aaron, he comes to her apartment in the middle of the night. They reconcile, and move in together soon after. The book ends with a discussion of LGBT representation in the media and the perception that transgender women need to be out and visible at all times. Storygiving campaign On Christmas Eve 2013, Mock launched the Redefining Realness Storygiving Campaign. The campaign fulfilled 127 book requests from people who wished to read Redefining Realness but had financial constraints. Redefining Realness video series On 30 January 2014, Mock posted a series of six videos on her YouTube channel discussing topics covered in her memoir. She talks about growing up while transgender, having to take care of herself because her parents did not, hoping that her book will reach other young transgender girls. She discusses coming out, as both transgender and a sex worker, which she says is a big theme of her book. She shares about her experience in the sex industry, how she worked in other jobs but sex work gave quick earnings and a tight-knit community, and how sex work is complex. In talking about popular culture, Mock says that Beyoncé, Aaliyah, and Janet Jackson influenced her growing up. Pop culture references appear throughout Redefining Realness, references many different types of media. Passing, Mock says, implies that transgender people are not actually the gender their identify as; she is not passing as a woman, she is a woman. In the last video, Mock discusses reading at the library as a child, how stories about women who inspired her impacted her growing up, and how her book might be the same for young girls now.  Reception  Mock has said that she wrote Redefining Realness for transgender girls of color, particularly, her own childhood self. However, many cisgender women of color have connected to themes and moments in the memoir. Redefining Realness is praised for being one of a small number of literary texts written by transgender people of color, especially ones that feature themes of reading. Redefining Realness has also been praised for its complexity in representation of transgender people of color and for combining Western and African structures of autobiography. A 2014 review of the book claims that while Mock's memoir is personal, it reaches across the queer, transgender, and female communities to relate to many people. In the paper \\"Redefining Realness?: On Janet Mock, Laverne Cox, TS Madison, and the Representation of Transgender Women of Color in Media\\", scholar Julian Kevon Glover complicates the popular reception of Redefining Realness. Glover states that Mock's memoir has gained such high esteem because Mock's transition journey reflects traditional heteronormative norms, beauty standards, and respectability politics. Glover states that many transgender women who do not uphold heteronormative ideals rarely get as much media prestige. While the popularity of Redefining Realness is significant for representation of transgender women, Glover states, many transgender activists are denied media presence because their bodies or actions are not in line with respectability politics. Mock published a second memoir, Surpassing Certainty: What My Twenties Taught Me, which covers her twenties, a period not much discussed in Redefining Realness.  Influences  Zora Neale Hurston's Their Eyes Were Watching God was a significant influence in Mock's writing of Redefining Realness. Their Eyes was an important book in Mock's girlhood because it was a book about Black women, identity, and love. Other Black female authors that were formative for Mock and her development of Redefining Realness were Toni Morrison, Alice Walker, Maya Angelou, and Audre Lorde. References to Their Eyes Were Watching God appear throughout the book. She also includes quotes from Ralph Ellsion, Gloria Anzaldua, and James Baldwin. In a review by David B. Green Jr., Redefining Realness was stated to do more than just tell a personal story as it builds from the tradition of earlier women of color writers, such as those Mock references in the memoir. Green states that Mock's memoir relates to women of all kinds, not just transgender women of color.

Characteristics  This sea cucumber is somewhat unusual in appearance in comparison with other sea cucumbers (and even within its family), as it looks more like a jellyfish with its large umbrella-like swimming structure supported by a ring of around 12 strongly modified oral tentacles, its small tapered body and its swimming position with the mouth on top. The body is translucent with a pale purple pigmentation. The mouth is surrounded by around 15 short feeding tentacles like any sea cucumber, and the veil can be contracted like jellyfishes do (it is interrupted at the central ventral radius). The animal seems to reach around 16 cm in total diameter. This species constitutes the only true pelagic holothurian (and even echinoderm) known to date. However, its swimming seems mostly passive, more like slightly controlled drifting. Image:Pelagothuria natatrix (cropped).pngPelagothuria natatrix observed in 2011 off the Galápagos islands.

He played defenseman for 17 games on the varsity squad from 1924 to 1927. After college After leaving Notre Dame he became an assistant football coach at the University of Detroit under former Notre Dame standout Gus Dorais. While at Detroit he also served as head hockey coach. After 16 years at Detroit he moved to become assistant football coach at the University of Iowa under Clem Crowe. He later moved onto Cornell University to become an assistant football coach. In 1947, Boeringer replaced Nick Bawlf as Cornell head ice hockey coach after Bawlf became sick and unable to coach. His team was made up of mostly sophomores and was disadvantaged by having to practice and play their games outdoors. They cancelled their first game against Colgate due to mild weather that made practice on condition of Dwyer’s Dam Rink on Beebe Lake impractical. After a cold spell just before their first home game against United States Military Academy, the ice on Beebe Lake became fit for playing. The lack of practice showed with Cornell losing by a score of 9 goals to 0. He coached the rest of the season with his team going 0–4. After the season Cornell dropped varsity hockey for 10 years citing several mild winters making practice on Beebe Lake difficult and unable to compete with cold- weather schools and schools with indoor rinks.

Communications =Telephone= Australia requires that pre-paid mobile telecommunications providers verify the identity of individuals before providing service. =Internet= According to Greens Senator Scott Ludlam, Australian law enforcement agencies were issued 243,631 warrants to obtain telecommunications logs between July 2010 and June 2011, which vastly overshadowed the 3500-odd legal intercepts of communications. In 2013 it was reported that under Australian law state, territory and federal law enforcement authorities can access a variety of 'non-content' data from internet companies like Telstra, Optus and Google with authorisation by senior police officers or government officials rather than judicial warrant, and that \\"During criminal and revenue investigations in 2011-12, government agencies accessed private data and internet logs more than 300,000 times.\\" Google's transparency report shows a consistent trend of growth in requests by Australian authorities for private information, constantly rising approximately 20% year-on-year. The most recent published volume for the period ending December 2013 indicates a volume of around four individual requests per calendar day. Telstra's transparency report for the period 1 July - 31 December 2013 does not include requests by national security agencies, only police and other agencies. Nevertheless, in the six-month period 40,644 requests were made, 36,053 for \\"Telstra customer information, carriage service records and pre-warrant checks\\" (name, address, date of birth, service number, call/SMS/internet records. Call records include called party, date, time and duration. Internet information includes date, time and duration of internet sessions and email logs from Telstra-administered addresses), 2,871 for \\"Life threatening situations and Triple Zero emergency calls\\", 270 for \\"Court orders\\", 1450 for \\"Warrants for interception or access to stored communications\\" (real time access): an average of around 222 requests per calendar day. Cover page of the first version of the secret UKUSA Agreement, which was disclosed to the public in 2011, and was the basis for the modern Five Eyes international surveillance alliance. Aerial view of Pine Gap, one of Australia's major spy facilities. In 2013 more than 500 authors including five Nobel prize winners and Australian identities Frank Moorhouse, John Coetzee, Helen Garner, Geraldine Brooks and David Malouf signed a global petition to protest mass surveillance after the whistleblower Edward Snowden's global surveillance disclosures informed the world, including Australians, that they are being monitored by the National Security Agency's XKeyscore system and its boundless informant. Snowden had further revealed that Australian government intelligence agencies, specifically the Australian Signals Directorate, also have access to the system as part of the international Five Eyes surveillance alliance. In August 2014 it was reported that law-enforcement agencies had been accessing Australians' web browsing histories via internet providers such as Telstra without a warrant (Optus confirmed that they cooperate with law enforcement, and Vodafone did not return a request for comment). The revelations came less than a week after government attempts to increase their surveillance powers through new legislation allowing offensive computer hacking by government intelligence agencies, and mere months after outrage surrounding the government's offer to share personal information about citizens with Five Eyes intelligence partners. As of August 2014, no warrant is required for organisations to access the so-called 'metadata' information of private parties. This is information regarding \\"calls and emails sent and received, the location of a phone, internet browsing activity. There is no access to the content of the communication, just how, to or from whom, when and where.\\" Under current law many organisations other than federal, state and territory police and security agencies such as ASIO can get access to this information, including \\"any agency that collects government revenue\\", for example the RSPCA, the Australian Crime Commission, the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (though reportedly temporarily removed from the list), the Australian Tax Office, Centrelink, Medicare, Australia Post, the Australian Fisheries Management Authority, the Victorian Taxi Services Commission, the Victorian Transport Accident Commission, WorkSafe Victoria, local councils and foreign law enforcement agencies. In the 2013-2014 financial year there were over half a million disclosures of metadata to agencies. The Australian Communications and Media Authority provides instructions for internet service providers and other telecommunications providers about their law enforcement, national security and interception obligations. During the 2015-2016 financial year 712 warrants were issued for access to stored communications, 3,857 interception warrants were issued, and 63 enforcement agencies were granted 333,980 authorisations for metadata access. =2014 proposals= A range of proposals are under discussion that affect surveillance of the population by government in conjunction with commercial service providers. Hacking powers The proposals seek to give the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation (ASIO) the right to hack into computers and modify them. Single computer warrant to become umbrella surveillance The proposals seek to give ASIO the power to spy on whole computer networks under a single computer-access warrant. Spying on citizens abroad The proposals seek to give the Australian Secret Intelligence Service (ASIS) the power to collect intelligence on Australian citizens overseas. Law against media and whistleblowing Section 35P of the proposals seeks to create a new criminal offence, with a maximum penalty of 10 years imprisonment, for revealing information about so-called 'special intelligence operations'. There are no exceptions listed, and the law would apply to journalists even if they were unaware that they were revealing information about such an operation. Shadow Attorney-General Mark Dreyfus called the measure \\"an unprecedented overreach\\". Mandatory data retention Mandatory data retention for two years of data relating to the internet and telecommunications activity of all Australians is currently under discussion. On Tuesday, August 5, government Communications Minister Malcolm Turnbull complained about \\"waking up to newspaper headlines concerning the government's controversial plan for mandatory data retention\\", stating the government \\"risked unnecessary difficulties by pushing ahead with the data retention regime without fully understanding the details\\". In 2012, Turnbull had opposed mandatory retention. On Friday, August 8, Australia's federal privacy commissioner, Timothy Pilgrim, stated he felt it remained \\"unclear\\" exactly what data was to be retained, and that \\"there is the potential for the retention of large amounts of data to contain or reveal a great deal of information about people's private lives and that this data could be considered 'personal information' under the Privacy Act\\". Later in the month, the head of Australian Security Intelligence Organisation (ASIO) appealed for access to private citizens' data on the grounds that commercial entities may already be collecting it. On February 19, 2015 the Australian Broadcasting Corporation's Radio National program Download This Show broadcast an interview with a former police employee who had worked extensively with metadata, on condition of anonymity. The former employee was quoted as feeling the proposed system was open for abuse and may one day be used against Australians who download music and TV shows. On February 22, 2015 Australian Federal Police Assistant Commissioner Tim Morris made the following claims appealing to blind trust from the public. In 2015 the issue of costs became more heavily discussed in the media with figures such as 1% of all national telecommunications revenue annually or \\"two battleships\\" per year used. Prominent parties concerned about the proposals include: * Media, Entertainment and Arts Alliance, the Australian journalists' union * Timothy Pilgrim, Privacy Commissioner * Gillian Triggs, Human Rights Commissioner * the Law Council of Australia * Communications Alliance * the Australian Mobile Telecommunications Association * Fairfax Media * News Corp Australia * councils for civil liberties across Australia * Blueprint for Free Speech * Australian Lawyers for Human Rights * the Institute of Public Affairs * the Australian Privacy Foundation * Electronic Frontiers Australia * Privacy International * George Williams, one of Australia's leading constitutional lawyers and public commentators and University of New South Wales professor * Dr Keiran Hardy, Research Associate, Faculty of Law, University of New South Wales =2018=  Telecommunications and Other Legislation Amendment (Assistance and Access) Act  On 14 August 2018, the federal government published draft text of the Assistance and Access Bill (often referred to by its satirical name, the Ass Access Bill).Australian Cyber Assistance & Access Legislation, The ASS Access Bill 2018 Highpants 20 September 2018 Modelled after the British Investigatory Powers Act, the legislation was designed to help overcome \\"the challenges posed by ubiquitous encryption\\". Under the bill, designated communications providers (which include carriage service providers, any electronic service with end-users in Australia, anyone who develops software likely to be used by a carriage service or an electronic service with end-users in Australia, or anyone who supplies or manufactures components likely to be used in customer equipment likely to be used in Australia\\") can be ordered to assist in intercepting information relevant to a case, either by means of an existing capability if possible (Technical Assistance Order, TAO), or being ordered to develop, test, add, or remove equipment for a new interception capability (Technical Capability Order, TCO). A \\"Technical Assistance Request\\" (TAR) can also be issued, which has fewer restrictions, but is not compulsory. Orders must be connected to a warrant under the Telecommunications (Interception and Access) Act or the Surveillance Devices Act. Actions requested under the act must be \\"reasonable, proportionate, practicable, and technically feasible\\", and mandatory orders cannot compel a communications provider to add a \\"systemic weakness or vulnerability, such as requiring one to \\"implement or build a new decryption capability.\\" or \\"render systemic methods of authentication or encryption less effective.\\" An annual report must be issued on how many orders and requests are issued. Outside of certain proceedings processes, all specific information on requests and orders are confidential, and it is illegal to publish them publicly. Only the chief officer of an \\"interception agency\\" (which includes the Australian Criminal Intelligence Commission, Australian Federal Police, and state police with permission from the AFP) or the director-general of the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation can issue a TAO or TCO. The Minister for Communications must additionally approve a request for a TCO. A TAR can be issued by these parties, or the Australian Signals Directorate. The proposed legislation faced numerous criticisms from politicians, advocacy groups, and the tech industry. Liberal Democratic Party Senator David Leyonhjelm argued that the bill was \\"a draconian measure to grant law enforcement authorities unacceptable surveillance powers that invade Australians' civil rights\\", alleging that users could be compelled to provide passwords for their personal devices at the request of law enforcement, or be fined. it was felt that the bill had weaker oversight and safeguards than the equivalent UK legislation, where requests for assistance are subject to judicial review. It was also noted that although providers could not be ordered to do so, they could still be encouraged by the government via a TAR to add a \\"systemic weakness\\" to their systems. In testimony, cyptography expert and Stanford Law School attorney Riana Pfefferkorn argued that \\"whenever you open up a vulnerability in a piece of software or a piece of hardware, it's going to have consequences that are unforeseeable.\\" The bill was passed by the Parliament of Australia on 6 December 2018 as the Telecommunications and Other Legislation Amendment of 2018, commonly known as TOLA. Bill Shorten of the Australian Labor Party described the bill's passage as being \\"half a win\\", since he wanted Parliament to \\"reach at least a sensible conclusion before the summer on the important matter of national security\\". He explained that there were \\"legitimate concerns about the encryption legislation\\", but that he did not want to \\"walk away from my job and leave matters in a stand-off and expose Australians to increased risk in terms of national security.\\" Shorten did state that he would consider amendments to the bill when Parliament returned in 2019. A number of Australian tech firms and startups warned that the bill could harm their ability to do business internationally. Bron Gondwana, CEO of the e-mail host FastMail, felt that the Assistance and Access Bill \\"makes complying with both Australian law and the EU's GDPR privacy requirements harder, putting Australian businesses at a disadvantage in a global marketplace.\\" After the bill's passing, the service faced concerns and questions over its effects from current and potential users, which has caused a decline in business. Encryption provider Senetas stated that the country could face \\"the real prospect of sales being lost, exports declining, local companies failing or leaving Australia, jobs in this industry disappearing and related technical skills deteriorating.\\" In June 2020, as requested by parliament,the Independent National Security Legislation Monitor (INSLM) released a report which recommended changes to the act to require independent and technically competent review of compulsory orders requested under the act. Specific Incidents =June 2019 Incidents= Raid on Journalist's Home On the 4th June 2019, the home of Annika Smethurst, national politics editor of the Sunday Telegraph and other News Corp Australia titles, was raided by the Australian Federal Police. Annika had reported in April 2018 that Australia's Departments of Home Affairs and Defence were discussing a proposal to grant the Australian Signals Directorate (ASD) new powers, such that emails, bank records and text messages of Australians could be accessed by the ASD if the two ministries gave their approval. Currently the ASD is not allowed to spy on Australians, although Australia's domestic spy agency, the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation, can already investigate citizens with a warrant. News Corp Australia called the raid \\"outrageous and heavy-handed and a dangerous act of intimidation which will chill public interest reporting.\\" The Media, Entertainment and Arts Alliance, a relevant union in Australia, said the police sought to \\"punish a journalist for reporting a legitimate news story that was clearly in the public interest.\\" It was subsequently reported that Malcolm Turnbull had vetoed the proposal to expand the ASD's powers. Inquiry in to Radio Journalist's Sources Also on the 4th June 2019, Ben Fordham, a prominent radio journalist for 2GB, reported that his team had been contacted by an official from the Department of Home Affairs requesting assistance with the investigation in to how he obtained information that up to six boats carrying asylum seekers had recently tried to reach Australia. Australian Federal Police raid the Australian Broadcasting Corporation On the 5th June 2019, at least six Australian Federal Police (AFP) officers raided the ABC with a warrant allowing them to access, alter and delete information allegedly in relation to reporting made based on secret files exposing the misconduct of Australian soldiers in Afghanistan. In a statement ABC Managing Director David Anderson said the police raid \\"raises legitimate concerns over freedom of the press. The ABC stands by its journalists, will protect its sources and continue to report without fear or favour on national security and intelligence issues when there is a clear public interest.\\" John Lyons, Executive Editor ABC News & ABC Head of Investigative Journalism commented on the raid by the AFP: The AFP released a statement asserting there was \\"no link between the execution of search warrants in the ACT suburb of Kingston yesterday (4 June 2019) and those on the Ultimo premises of the ABC today (5 June 2019).\\" Travel =International= General depiction of northern Australia's Jindalee Operational Radar Network, used to track airborne and seaborne vessels across a vast area. Australia and the European Union have signed an agreement for the advanced sharing of passenger name records of international travelers. Similar agreements are in place with other countries. In addition to passenger information and standard radar, Australia uses the Jindalee Operational Radar Network to detect individual boats and planes in the north and west of the country. =Domestic= Vehicles can be tracked by a range of systems including automatic number plate recognition (ANPR), video and sensor-based traffic surveillance networks, cellular telephone tracking (if a device is known to be in the vehicle) and automated toll networks. The ANPR systems are intelligent transportation systems which can identify vehicles and drivers. ANPR is known under various names in Australia: SCATS in Sydney, New South Wales; ACTS in Adelaide, CATSS in Canberra, SCRAM in Melbourne, DARTS in the Northern Territory and PCATS in Perth. Mass transit =New South Wales= In December 2014, certain universities such as Sydney University delayed collaboration with the new Opal card system scheduled to fully replace existing, anonymous paper tickets on New South Wales mass transit, citing privacy concerns, whereas Macquarie University, University of New South Wales and Australian Catholic University had already agreed to provide the \\"student data\\" to the card network. Data is made available to other NSW government departments and law enforcement agencies. Concerns about privacy have been repeatedly raised in the mainstream media, with commentators questioning the extent to which user data can be accessed by authorities. According to the Opal Privacy Policy, data is made available to other NSW government departments and law enforcement agencies. On the 13th of March 2015 it was announced that Opal cards would be linked to commuter car park spaces, such that private road vehicle identities would become associated with individual mass transit use. =Other states= The extent and frequency to which individual traveler data is released without a warrant remains poorly documented for the following systems: *go card, Brisbane's smartcard system *Metrocard, Adelaide's smartcard system *myki, Melbourne's smartcard system *SmartRider, Perth's smartcard system Related law This section outlines the main legal references for mass surveillance in Australia. =National= Under Australian law, the following acts are prominent federal law in the area of surveillance. *Telecommunications (Interception and Access) Act 1979 (formerly known as the Telecommunications (Interception) Act 1979) *Telecommunications Act 1997 *Surveillance Devices Act 2004 *Privacy Act 1988 *Intelligence Services Act 2001 *Intelligence Services Amendment Act 2004 A separate body of state-level laws also exists. =International agreements= Australia is part of the Five Eyes international surveillance network, run by the United States National Security Agency and generally protected from public scrutiny citing 'national security' concerns. According to the Canberra Times and cited policymakers, one of the most prominent critics of these agreements was the Australian National University academic Des Ball, who died in October 2016.

As a son of an unconventional religious leader, Sewon experienced religious prejudice and discrimination from very early on in his childhood. The child became obsessive in painting, which was his only means to escape from the mental suffering caused by unbearable religious upheaval, inevitable personal sacrifice of freedom, as well as religious discrimination.A Brief history of Trans-Artist Based on the refined painting skill acquired through his compulsive habit of painting, he was able to study abroad (Georgetown Preparatory School, the United States) as a reward of winning a national art competition. He held two solo exhibitions as a prodigious painter in high school, but the failure to perform his new concept of installation art discouraged him in such a way that he eventually gave up his art and majored in Politics, Philosophy and Economics at Oxford University.History - Art of Enlightenment and Awakening official website However, after the sudden passing of his father, he was obliged to take on insurmountable financial liability and the responsibility of restructuring his father's legacy, which eventually led him to return to art, expressing the sacred teachings on spiritual transcendence, not only based on his father's teachings, but from his own self-confirmation of the spiritual awakening experience.

After assuming the leadership, he introduced the ”Art of Enlightenment and Awakening” which is the expression of the Hanol spirit in the form of art and architecture. He attempted to integrate ‘art’ with ‘the spiritual teachings of Hanol principles’ in order to transform Hanol-gyo into a more liberal, flexible and innovative organization. His art provided a basis for the structural evolution of Hanol-gyo.The 50th Anniversary of Hanolgyo - Spreading the Hanol spirit based on humanitarian aims Power Korea. February 2015 issue, P. 71~77 In accordance with the founder’s last will, he succeeded in persuading the board and the Hanol spiritual committee to officially make religious conversion unnecessary and constitutionalized religious multiplicity: Hanol-gyo allows its participants and adherents to practice other religions as well.Hanol-gyo Encyclopedia of Korean Culture According to the guidance to Hanol-gyo, he expressed the essence of the transcendental teachings on enlightenment and awakening - the self-liberation of consciousness.Hanol-gyo official website He officially proclaimed that the symbolic function of the regional chapels of HANOL could be replaced by the “Art and Architecture of Enlightenment”, and allowed particular traditional ceremonies and the formality of rituals to be substituted by a simple contemplation on the Enlightenment Art or meditation on self-awareness. He attempted to transform the existing belief system by integrating ‘Art and Spirituality’. Sewon introduced the concept of 'Spiritual Audience' instead of the traditional notion of religious followers.  Trans-Art  Trans-Art (also known as Trans-form Art or Transcendental Art) can be considered as the re- establishment of the 'Art and Architecture of Enlightenment and Awakening’ in a fine art form (non-religious form), based on the self-confirmation of the sacred teachings of the transcendental philosophy that he acquired;Introduction to Trans-Art 'Art of Transcendence' and the elaboration of \\"Super-Individual art (i.e. Trans-ego art)” which he introduced at the Tokyo exhibition.Super-Individual art Art of Enlightenment and Awakening official website In Part 1: Optical Awakening, the artist expresses spiritual transcendence by using the multi-dimensional perspectives that he acquired from his own personal experience of spiritual awakening.Trans-Art official website In Part 2: Tasting Art (Taste of Awakening), he integrates Art with Taste in order to express a glimpse of awakening by providing an extraordinary tasting experience.Trans-Art Part 2 Tasting-Art In Part 3: Mobile Art project plan (Trans-Renaissance : Trans-Dystopia), he combines Technology with Art; the audience can participate in creating lights of Universal Trinity (a form of installation art) on a global scale, thereby expressing and experiencing their collective sentiment using a smart-phone application.Trans-Art Part 3 Mobile Art After Sewon Shin reformed the Hanol-gyo foundation, he resigned from all of his duties and returned to his art in order to introduce a new form of art called Trans-art. According to the official website, \\"Trans-Art is ‘art’ that transcends the conventional form of art: the Trans-artist attempts to express the ‘Enlightenment and Awakening’, which is beyond ‘Form’, by using the ‘multi-dimensional expression method’ that he acquired from his own experience of the ‘enlightening and awakening’ process.\\"Art of Transcendence - Artist Official website In Part 1 multi-dimensional approach of the ‘Awakening series’, he is expressing the process of ‘Ego dis-identification’ that he acquired from his suicidal experience, which caused the separation of the ‘Ego-mind (involuntarily accumulated mental synapse and construct of mind- structure)’ and ‘Consciousness (Original state of being or True-Nature)’, initiating the gradual awakening in his consciousness. From the enlightening experiences, he came to realize that ‘art’ and ‘spirituality’ share one and the same nature of showing a doorway into another dimension of consciousness where our ‘true essence beyond form’ is indwelling. He is expressing a glimpse of ‘enlightenment and awakening’ which is ‘beyond form’ by using the ‘form of Trans-art’.Trans-Art: past summary - Trans-Art official website According to the guidance to Trans-Art, Trans Art Part 1, the multi-dimensional expression of \\"Enlightenment and Awakening\\", can be perceived and experienced as an indirect experience of ‘Spiritual Transcendence’ and a ‘Glimpse of Awakening’ in the form of art – “the preview of the Ego dis-identification which entails the separation of Mind (Ego) & Consciousness (True Nature)”. In his major work, the ‘Optical Awakening series’, the artist shows the consecutive stages of the ‘Enlightenment and Awakening’ process based on his own experience. The series comprises 'Awakening Dimensions', ‘Initiation of Awakening’, ‘Awakening True-Nature’, ‘Flash of Enlightening’, ‘Trans-Perceiving Ego’, ‘Dark-side of Ego’, ‘Trans-Quantum Physics of Mind’, ‘Trans-Perceiving Mental Synapse’, ‘Self-Liberation’, ‘Breaking Free’, ‘Quest for Immortality’, and ‘Trans- Perception’. Hanol Spiritual and Cultural Movement of Art Hanol Spiritual and Cultural Movement of Art refers to a new type of religious endeavor through which anyone can experience the “Hanol principles on enlightenment and awakening” through art, without religious obligation or conventional religious participation. Hanol-gyo is a modern re-establishment of a Korean traditional religion that laid the spiritual foundation for the old Korean empire Gochosun. In commemoration of the 50th anniversary re-establishment, Hanol-gyo officially agreed upon reformation at the general assembly, and endorsed the Hanol Spiritual & Cultural Movement of Art. At the official request of Hanol- gyo, the artist provided his artworks [Optical Awakening], for the Hanol Spiritual & Cultural Movement of Art which enabled the audience to experience the Hanol religion and its philosophy without any conventional religious activity. According to the guide to Trans-Art, \\"Optical Awakening\\" can be regarded as an indirect experience of 'Spiritual Transcendence' and a 'Glimpse of Enlightenment' in the form of art – the ‘Preview of the Ego dis- identification’ which entails the separation of Mind (Ego) & Consciousness (True Nature). Regardless of personal religious belief, the participants the Hanol Spiritual and Cultural Movement of Art can easily experience 'what spiritual awakening is' simply by appreciating the art.특이점을 맞이한 정신문화 시각견성《Korea Economic Daily TV》2017-08-07.

Bixby is notable in his own right for his high standing in his profession, for his technical contributions to it, and for his service in the American Civil War. However, he is best known for having had as his \\"cub pilot\\" (that is, apprentice or trainee) the young man known to him as Sam Clemens, later to become famous under his pen name as American author Mark Twain. Twain's descriptions of Bixby's character and pedagogic style form a good part of his memoir Life on the Mississippi, and it was through this medium that Bixby—much to his annoyance—became well-known beyond the circles of his family, friends and profession. Early life Horace Bixby was born in Geneseo, New York, a town near Rochester in the Finger Lakes region of New York, on May 8, 1826, to Sylvanus and Hanna Bixby. While still in his teens, he left home and moved to Cincinnati, Ohio where he first worked in a tailor's shop, and then became a mud clerk on the packet boat Olivia. Within two years, he had become the Olivia pilot. Pre-Civil War career As Twain describes at length in Life on the Mississippi, a rare combination of skills and talents, honed to perfection and maintained there by unremitting drill, was required in the mid-nineteenth century, in order to safely navigate a steamboat on the Mississippi and the Missouri, \\"vast streams...whose alluvial banks cave and change constantly, whose snags are always hunting up new quarters, whose sandbars are never at rest, whose channels are for ever dodging and shirking, and whose obstructions must be confronted in all nights and all weathers without [at that time] the aid of a single light-house or a single buoy.\\" The pilot needed to have total, perfect, and instantaneous recall for every detail of the river's meandering and ever-changing channel, with its chutes, islands, sandbars, underwater rocks, \\"reefs\\", snags, and sunken wrecks. He needed to be able to intuit exactly how any rise or fall in the river would affect its minimum depth at hundreds of shoal places, and know how to read the surface of the water \\"like a book.\\" Finally, and most importantly, the successful pilot required \\"good and quick judgment and decision, and a cool, calm courage that no peril can shake.\\" Successful pilots were able to command a salary variously reported as six times that of a clergyman and greater than that of the Vice President of the United States. In this demanding profession, Horace Bixby was an acknowledged master. A steamboat's pilot had not only to keep the boat safe from navigational hazards, but also to complete each journey in the shortest possible time. The unusually good speed that he was able to make without compromising safety earned him the title \\"Lightning\\" Bixby. Switzer attributes this sobriquet to his having once completed the voyage from New Orleans to St. Louis in only 4 days, 14 hours and 20 minutes. Twain recounts an incident in which Bixby saved his steamboat a full night's delay by a tour de force of piloting, prompting another pilot aboard at the time to exclaim, \\"By the Shadow of Death, but he's a lightning pilot!\\" Bixby was also unusual in that he held a pilot's licence for all three of the major inland waterways—the lower Mississippi, the Missouri, and the Ohio—rather than only for one, as was the case with most pilots. Piloting on the Missouri during Bixby's first years there (1856–58) presented special challenges due to the undeveloped nature of the country through which it passed; a steamboat might find its forward progress impeded \\"by buffalo herds crossing the river one day and by Sioux warriors the next.\\" A partial list of the boats on which Bixby was employed as pilot during this period includes Olivia, Hungarian, Paul Jones, Colonel Crossman, Crescent City, Rufus J. Lackland, William M. Morrison, New Falls City, and Aleck Scott. Bixby's time on the Colonel Crossman included an explosion in which 14 people were killed. Early relationship with Twain Bixby first met Twain in February 1857, when the latter was 21 years old. Twain was traveling to New Orleans on the Paul Jones, on the way to South America, where he planned to raise coca, a legal crop at the time, as the process of extracting cocaine from it had not yet been invented. However, he had harbored a boyhood dream of becoming a river pilot, which he decided to make one more effort to pursue. After some negotiations, Bixby agreed to teach him the lower Mississippi for $500, of which $100 was paid in advance and the balance was to be paid out of his salary after becoming a pilot. As it happened, Twain was able to pay only $300 before the outbreak of the Civil War shut down all commercial traffic on the Mississippi. He and Bixby agreed between them to cancel the remaining balance. For much of the next two years, Twain served his apprenticeship under Bixby, though occasionally his mentor placed him with other pilots, such as during the period when Bixby was learning, and working on, the Missouri River. After Twain got his licence, the two of them worked together as pilots on the Crescent City and the New Falls City. In Life on the Mississippi, Twain portrays Bixby as an \\"irascible but lovable mentor.\\" One point on which Bixby's friends took issue with Twain was his portrayal of Bixby as \\"a profane man,\\" that is, as someone who occasionally used profanity for emphasis in conversation. They reported him to be a person who was always \\"gentle of speech.\\" Note however that there was a difference in the etiquette of shore-based discourse and that on board a vessel, where the use of bad language by the crew (among themselves) was commonplace, and even expected. Civil War service Horace Bixby served as pilot of the USS Benton from October 25, 1861 until August 28, 1862. The Benton was the flagship of the Mississippi River Squadron, and both Twain and Bixby's obituary refer to him as having been the squadron's \\"Chief Pilot\\" at the time of the Battle of Memphis. Bixby's obituary states that he \\"always held the Union victory at Memphis due to the information he gave Commodore Foote.\\" Post-war career Horace Bixby was one of the pilots of the steamboat Bertrand, which sank on April 1, 1865, after hitting a snag in the Missouri River, north of Omaha, Nebraska, in what was to become the DeSoto National Wildlife Refuge. The wreck of the Bertrand was excavated in 1968, and such of its cargo as survived—over 500,000 artefacts—are on display at the museum of the DeSoto National Wildlife Refuge near Missouri Valley, Iowa. In the last few decades of his life, Bixby worked on the river both as pilot and as captain. (A captain was in charge of all aspects of his boat's management for its navigation while underway, which was the exclusive province of the pilot on duty, and in which the captain was forbidden to interfere.) During much of this period, Bixby worked as a captain for the Anchor Line, and owned more stock in the company than any other employee, having heavily invested in one of its predecessor companies. Together with George Richey, Bixby was granted a patent for a new type of binnacle light in 1871. This invention was part of a larger project to improve the safety of navigation on the river. As described by Twain, \\"Horace Bixby and George Ritchie [sic] have charted the crossings and laid out the courses by compass; they have invented a lamp to go with the chart, and have patented the whole. With these helps, one may run [the boat] in the fog now, with considerable security, and with a confidence unknown in the old days.\\" A partial list of the boats on which Bixby served during this period, and the positions he held, includes City of Natchez (Master,1885-1886), Crystal City (Captain, 1887), City of Hickman (Master, 1890), City of Alton (Captain), and City of Baton Rouge (Master). Bixby was a part-owner of the City of Alton, having purchased it in partnership with his father-in-law and two other men. Bixby remained professionally active until the very end of his life. His final command assignment, of the government snagboat Horatio G. Wright, was completed on July 30, 1912. He was awaiting a call to take out the government tugboat Nokomis when he died two days later, in Maplewood, Missouri, on August 1. As his obituary stated, \\"He died as he often said he wished to die, 'in the harness.'\\" Later relationship with Twain When Twain returned to the Mississippi River, in the spring of 1882, to collect material for the later chapters of Life on the Mississippi, Bixby was happy to meet him in New Orleans. By all evidence, they remained life-long friends. Although it appears that Bixby did not greatly blame Twain for his portrayal of him, the charm of being associated with him in the public mind, and of being pestered by reporters for yet more details about their time together, quickly paled. Bixby's obituary states that \\"Captain Bixby received hundreds of letters from strangers, who knew him solely through Mark Twain's books. This became distasteful to him, and during late years he had avoided all mention of Mark Twain's name.\\" Waterways Journal of April 30, 1910 reports that, \\"In Memphis one time, [Bixby] told a reporter that he wished Mark Twain were dead so he wouldn't be bothered in retailing reminiscences about him longer. He was annoyed when the remark was printed, but there is no record that Mark Twain ever heard of it, and if he had, it was just the sort of a whimsicality that he would have appreciated.\\" Family and portrait Bixby was first married to Susan Weibling of New Orleans. According to Switzer, the marriage took place in 1853, but other sources date it in 1860. They had no children who survived infancy, and she died in 1867. In 1869, he married Mary Sheble, daughter of Captain Edwin A. Sheble of St. Louis, with whom he had three children, a daughter, Edwina, and two sons, Edwin and George Mason. Edwina married Dr. Louis T. Pim in 1901, and by 1910 Horace and Mary had come to live with them. Mary Bixby survived her husband by nine years, dying in 1921. The two of them are buried in Bellefontaine Cemetery in St. Louis, Missouri. A portrait photograph of Horace Bixby may be viewed in the collection of UW-La Crosse. Portrayal in media Horace Bixby was portrayed by Robert Barrat in the 1944 film The Adventures of Mark Twain, by Robert Lansing in the Great Performances episode Life on the Mississippi, and by Doug Mancheski in the American Folklore Theatre production of the musical Life on the Mississippi.

He received the Kerala Sangeetha Nataka Akademi award, for his musical documentary Balikurup, a film on Malayalam poet, A. Ayyappan. Biography C. V. Sathyan was born on 10 October 1957, at Vatakara, in Kozhikode district, in the South Indian state of Kerala, to Cheeramveettil Kunkan and Cheeru. He was attracted by the leftist movement early on in his life and was associated with the social activism, in the district of Kozhikode, in the 1970s. These activities gathered momentum when he joined the naxalite movement. The next phase of his life started with his association with the renowned filmmaker John Abraham. Together, they launched Odessa Collective, a people's film movement, which made films such as Amma Ariyan, which gained critical and social acclaim. With John Abraham's death, in 1987, the movement lost its steam but Sathyan tried to carry it forward singlehandedly by founding Odessa Movies and keeping the free public screening of films on with a small projector. Sathyan was married to Jennifer, a college lecturer, and had two daughters, Sandra and Soya. He died on 19 August 2014, aged 56, succumbing to pancreatic cancer at the Kozhikode Medical College. His body was laid to rest at his residence at Narayana Nagar, Kozhikode. Social activism Sathyan's social life was kickstarted by the trade union movements of 1970s, in Kerala, when he got actively involved in many of the leftist activities during that time in Kozhikode. He was reported to have been associated with the trade union strikes at Iringalpara and other areas in Kozhikode. Later, Sathyan joined the naxalite movement and became the Kozhikode district Secretary of the Communist Party of India (Marxist–Leninist) and had to undergo imprisonment during the Emergency period of 1975–77. He was said to be one of the leaders of a people's mass trial, conducted by the CPI ML, at the Kozhikode Medical College Campus. Film career The friendship with John Abraham influenced Sathyan to join the Odessa Collective initiative. He participated the activities of the movement and the group, by collecting donations from the public, produced Amma Ariyan, widely regarded as the first people's cinema in India, and exhibited the film all over Kerala, free of charge. With John Abraham's death in 1987, the movement withered but Sathyan established Odessa Movies to carry the activities forward. His active association with the movement earned him the nickname Odessa Sathyan. Sathyan made five documentaries and a musical album. * Ithrayum Yathabhagam (The Path Traversed): a documentary on the life and works of noted Malayalam poet, A. Ayyappan. Sathyan's relationship with the poet was widely known and the documentary was the filmmaker's attempt to look at the poet's life from the perspective of an insider. * Vettayadappetta Manasu (The Haunted Mind) : The documentary narrates the story of Ramachandran Nair, a police officer who made headlines by confessing on killing the Naxalite leader, Varghese. * Mortuary of Love: A documentary on emotional and carnal natures of love and sexual exploitation of young girls. * Agnirekha (The Blazing Course): A documentary on the life of Angadippuram Balakriishnan, a Naxal activist hailed as a martyr by the movement. * Visudha Pashu (The Holy Cow): In the post production stage, under editing. * Balikurippu (The Sacrificial Note): A musical on the life of the poet, A.

He spent some time travelling in Europe where he taught in England and Germany. Intelligence work On his return to Australia in the mid-1950s, Barnett was recruited into the Australian Secret Intelligence Service (ASIS), Australia's foreign intelligence agency. He was head of the Australian stations in Singapore, Cambodia and South Vietnam, and later rose to the position of Deputy Director-General of ASIS. In September 1981, Barnett was appointed Director-General of Security. On 20 April 1983, Barnett requested and was granted an urgent meeting with the newly elected Prime Minister, Bob Hawke, whereupon he briefed him on what he called a 'matter of national security'—ASIO was aware of several meetings between David Combe, the national secretary of the Australian Labor Party, and First Secretary of the Soviet Embassy in Australia, Valery Ivanov. In what became known as the Combe–Ivanov affair, Hawke resolved to remove any possibility of Combe being recruited by Soviet intelligence. Ivanov was expelled from Australia, and although the second Hope Royal Commission in 1984 established that attempts were being made to recruit Combe, no intelligence breaches had taken place. Three years after his 1985 retirement from ASIO, Barnett published his memoirs, Tale of the Scorpion ().

Imam Sajjad is also the author of Al-Sahifa al-Sajjadiyya, another collection of prayers, and some researchers regard the whispered prayers as a supplementary part of the latter collection. Contents Every person experiences different feelings towards God throughout life. The Fifteen Whispered Prayers enable a person to recite the prayer which is in most accordance with his present mood and feeling. The prayers start with 'repentance', as repentance is the first step towards a genuine communion with God. #The Whispered Prayer of the Repenters #The Whispered Prayer of the Complainants #The Whispered Prayer of the Fearful #The Whispered Prayer of the Hopeful #The Whispered Prayer of the Desirous #The Whispered Prayer of the Grateful #The Whispered Prayer of the Obedient Toward God #The Whispered Prayer of the Devotees #The Whispered Prayer of the Lovers #The Whispered Prayer of the Mediation Seekers #The Whispered Prayer of the Utterly Poor #The Whispered Prayer of the Enlightened #The Whispered Prayer of the Aware #The Whispered Prayer of the Asylum Seekers #The Whispered Prayer of the Ascetic Background In the time of Imam Ali ibn Husayn Zayn al-Abidin, Islam was characterized by ignorance and corruption. Yazid and Marwan Ibn Hakam, who proclaimed themselves Amir al- Mu'minin, the leaders of Muslims, were, in fact, twisting the teachings of Islam. Nevertheless, no Muslim dared challenge their reign. The uprising of Imam Husayn ibn Ali against Yazid was mercilessly crushed. In a bloody encounter known as Battle of Karbala, all of Imam Husayn's men were slain except his young son, Ali, who was severely ill during that battle. At such a time when all freedom movements had been crushed and no one felt safe to speak out, prayer was the only vehicle to promote the true essence of Islam without arousing the caliph's ire. Analysis Muhammad Jamaluddin al-Makki al-Amili, known as al-Shaheed al-Awwal (the first martyr) is said to have collected and added the fifteen prayers to the Al-Sahifa al-Sajjadiyya in his book Al-Lum'at al-Dimashqiyya (The Damascene Glitter). Afterwards, most scholars who have written about the fifteen whispered prayers, considered them as a complementary section of the Al-Sahifa al-Sajjadiyya, while some others distinguished between the 54 supplications which makes the main body of Sahifa, and the added part which consists of the fifteen whispered prayers. According to Chittick the original fifty-four supplications \\"show an undeniable freshness and unity of theme and style, while the latter… add a certain orderliness and self-conscious artistry which may suggest the hand of an editor.\\" Nevertheless, these prayers have come to the attention of Shiites by Muhammad Baqir Majlisi who has narrated them in the authority of some companions of Imam Zany al-Abedin from the Imam.

Biography  Coming from a working-class family he started his career as a detective in 1981. He created the first Venezuelan police tactical team (BAE – ) in collaboration with other international law enforcement units like the German GSG 9 and various American Police Forces. Simonovis successfully led the rescue operation during the 1998 Cúa hostage crisis to save a woman held hostage by an armed robber. Simonovis later also served as security chief of the Metropolitan District of Caracas. Simonovis invited New York City Police Department chief William Bratton to Caracas to help with the criminality.  Arrest  He was arrested in November 2004 and accused by the Hugo Chávez government of the violence that took place in Caracas during April 2002, under the order of pro-Chávez judge Maikel Moreno. In 2009, he was found guilty and sentenced to 30 years in the notorious Ramo Verde Prison in the outskirts of Caracas. Due to the severe conditions in which he was held, his health deteriorated. He suffers from advanced osteoporosis because of sun deprivation for many years. Due to his deteriorating health, he requested humanitarian pardon on several occasions, all denied by the Venezuelan government. Simonovis was considered a political prisoner by human rights advocates. On 16 April 2012, former Supreme Tribunal of Justice judge Eladio Aponte Aponte wrote an open letter from San José, Costa Rica, in which he confessed having received orders and being pressured by president Hugo Chávez to convict Simonovis without rights, as well as Caracas Metropolitan Police officers Henry Vivas and Lázaro Forero, applying the maximum sentence for their participation during the Llaguno Overpass events. On September 2014, Simonovis was granted house arrest to receive medical treatment. = Release = During the 2019 Venezuelan presidential crisis, Simonovis escaped house arrest in May. Juan Guaidó, recognized by the National Assembly as the acting president of Venezuela, said that security forces loyal to him released Simonovis. Guaidó claims that the pardon was requested during the events of 30 April and that Simonovis was freed as part of \\"Operation Freedom\\" (). The Maduro administration did not comment on Simonovis' whereabouts. In an interview for El Pitazo, lawyer Joel García stated that Simonovis had left the country. According to his wife, Simonovis was threatened with being brought back to prison before he escaped. Simonovis wore an ankle monitor and was surveyed by Bolivarian Intelligence Service (SEBIN) forces. In June 2019, Simonovis published on Twitter a photo of himself next to the Equestrian of Simón Bolívar in Washington, D.C., United States. During an interview for Associated Press, Simonovis explained how during his escape he had to jump a 25 meters wall, break his ankle monitor, ride a boat whose motor later broke down and piloted a plane to get to United States. Leopoldo López, opposition leader that also was released on 30 April, contacted US and other foreign government officials to request help, and grant passage and entry to Simonovis. His wife published messages in Germany to divert the authorities. As he arrived in Washington, Simonovis said that he would work with U.S. authorities to investigate cases of corruption, drug trafficking and alleged links to terrorist groups by Venezuelan officials. As of end June, Maduro administration had not released any statement on Simonovis escape.

The Plenary met for the first time on August 6, 1977, in Valencia, presided over by the Socialist Joaquin Ruiz Mendoza, a meeting attended by the 29 Deputies and 12 Senators elected two months earlier who represented the Spanish Socialist Workers Party (13 Deputies and 7 Senators), Union of the Democratic Center (11 Deputies and 5 Senators), the Communist Party of Spain (2 Deputies), the Popular Socialist Party (1 Deputy), the Independent Candidacy of the Center (1 Deputy), and Popular Alliance (1 Deputy). At this first meeting the production of a Statute of autonomy was agreed upon, within the framework of a new Spanish Constitution that they aspired to, but did not even known if it would be addressed, as well as achieving a provisional pre-autonomic regime as a culmination of the legal process. Also agreed upon was the name, Plenario de Parliamentarios del País Valenciano (Parliamentary Plenary of the Valencian Country), unlike in other autonomous communities where they were named as Parliamentary Assemblies. The term \\"Valencian Country\\" was used and accepted by all, but this would later be a problem for its incorporation to autonomous status. At the same meeting in Valencia, the Plenary agreed to convene a demonstration in support of the pre-autonomy process and the parliamentary initiative, on 9 October, two months later, in the city of Valencia, linking the process with the historic date. On the day of the announcement, more than half a million people attended the demonstration. After the first meeting in August in Valencia, three others were held in Castellón, Alicante and Orihuela before the end of 1977. The meeting in Alicante formed the first group of parliamentarians who initiated the talks with the government for the establishment of a pre-autonomic system; the Orihuela meeting approved the substance of the aforementioned system. In 1978 there were two key meetings, held in February in Segorbe and Peñíscola, where the Spanish government was urged to quickly approve pre-autonomic regulations. On March 1, 1978 the Plenary reached an agreement with the central government that a pre-autonomic system would be established. Ten days later the Council of Ministers agreed to it and six days after that two basic rules, a Royal Law Decree and a Royal Decree of development, were published. In 1978, the autonomy process was initiated in Morella, culminating in the Statute of Autonomy of the Valencian Community. The President of the Valencian Generality, Josep Lluís Albinyana, convened a meeting of the Council of the Valencian Country on December 29, 1978, which was prevented by a heavy snowfall, and finally held on January 9, 1979. In that cold fifteenth-century Gothic hall of the Morella City Council, the proposal of President Albinyana was agreed upon, and by unanimous agreement of the parties PSOE, UCD, PCE, PSP and AP, the autonomy process, of the then officially named \\"Valencian Country\\", was initiated, in accordance with Article 151 of the Spanish Constitution, \\"in order to achieve the most perfect institutionalization of the Valencian community, for obtaining the maximum possible powers of self-government\\".

It was first published in the October 1962 issue of Scientific American and reprinted in Asimov's 1968 collection Asimov's Mysteries. Plot summary Arthur Trent is a starship pilot and the young accomplice of Brennmeyer, an elderly and brilliant researcher. Brennmeyer has been planning for thirty years to flee local governments and find a place from which to deal lucratively with criminal elements outside of known civilization. They have stolen a quantity of a valuable metal called \\"krillium\\" that will enable them to build large numbers of robots that they can sell to the highest bidder. Brennmeyer has compiled extensive data on stars and inhabited planets for many thousands of light-years around, so he feels quite confident that a randomly directed jump through hyperspace shall place them well beyond the reach of the police but within reach of a useful planet. (They will jump randomly because the time required to compute an ordinary jump is long enough that the police would catch them before the computation is complete.) He has engaged Trent to pilot their getaway ship, since he can no longer do so himself. Trent, however, does not wish to share the wealth. He murders Brennmeyer with a knife and flees by himself, confident that the ship's automatic search-and-compare program will locate a usable star and planet for him. He leaves all the evidence for the police to find, since he is sure that they shall not be able to catch him. He makes the jump, then waits for the computer to match a bright nearby star to its stored patterns. Much time elapses, however, without a match being found. Trent realizes, to his horror, that the star must be a recent nova, which the computer will therefore never be able to find in its maps. He is apparently unable to override the search procedure, and his life support will not last indefinitely. The story ends with Trent wishing that he had kept the knife.

(Anatolia is the Asiatic part of Turkey) Although the name of the dynasty is Candar, Ottoman Empire historians call the beylik İsfendiyaroğlu because of İsfendiyar's long reign His father was Kötürüm Bayazıt of the Candar dynasty and his mother was Sultan Hatun, the daughter of Süleyman Pasha and the granddaughter of Orhan of the Ottoman Empire, the second bey of the Ottoman Empire. His daughter Sultan Hatun was married firstly to Sultan Murad II and after Murad's death to Ishak Pasha, one of Murad II officials.Tomb of Ishak Pasha Early years Before he was enthroned, his beylik had been reduced to a small area around Sinop, a port on Black Sea coast. Afraid to lose this last part, İsfendiyar followed a peaceful policy with the neighbors. During the reign of the Ottoman sultan Bayezit I (1389-1402) who conquered most of the other beyliks, İsfendiyar was able to establish good relations with the Ottomans. Probably, the emergence of Kadı Burhaneddin’s short lived but powerful Turkmen state in the Central Anatolia was the main reason for the Ottoman-Candar cooperation Research by Yaşar Yücel p.160 Expansion During Timur's campaign to Anatolia (1402) he annexed the former territory of his beylik with Timur's approval. During the Ottoman Interregnum (1402-1413) he followed a balanced policy between the contestants. During the reign of Mehmed I of the Ottoman Empire (1413-1421) he tried to be an ally of the Ottomans.Prof. Yaşar Yüce-Prof. Ali Sevim: Türkiye tarihi Cilt I, AKDTYKTTK Yayınları, İstanbul, 1991 pp. 202-293Sinop MP Engin Altay’s page Kasım’s revolt and the last years However, in 1416, his son Kasım revolted with Ottoman support. İsfendiyar Bey had to abandon the territory to the south of Ilgaz Mountains (i.e., Çankırı). In 1419 Ottomans further annexed the eastern part of the beylik (i.e., Samsun) Death of Mehmed I and the two revolts during the early years of the new sultan Murat II, gave İsfendiyar Bey a chance to regain the loses. However, after Murat II restored order at home, he quickly defeated İsfendiyar. According to the treaty signed in 1423 (or 1424) İsfendiyar abandoned his gains, but kept Sinop and Kastamonu. In later years İsfendiyar established family relationships with the Ottomans. He died on 26 February 1440 in Sinop. He was succeeded by İbrahim II.

The arboretum is part of the Silesian Museum in Opava, and includes 7,000 different species from five continents, spread over 23 hectares. There are also 200 square metres of greenhouse space, including both tropical and sub- tropical climates, allowing the arboretum to also include trees and plants that require the climates of Africa, Asia, America and Australasia. History The collection was started by Quido Reidl in 1906 and expanded to 500 different species by 1928. At that time there was a manor house that had been built by Baron Antonín Luft and another older manor house built by Ludvík Klettenhof before 1836. Reidl moved on to create another arboretum in 1928 but he left this collection in the care of his daughter Elisabeth. She and her husband Walter Schubert looked after the manor houses and the collection until 1945, but they made no additions or improvements during that time. In 1945 the manor houses were confiscated by the Czechoslovak state. Following the end of the war the arboretum was neglected by a series of different owners until 1958 when the Silesian Museum took control of the site, and restored the original style, consisting of both solitary and mixed groups of trees spread around open areas. This design allows visitors to observe the different textures and shapes as they change during the seasons. The older manor house became part of a farm, and was demolished in the 1960s. The arboretum is open all year and charges are made for adults and children.

It was intended to operate services hourly, with peak services every 20 minutes with an overall journey time of about 58 minutes. It was hoped to carry 23,000 passengers daily and remove 18,000 car journeys within the first year of operation. This will reduce a need to widen the existing highway to eight lanes, with also suffers from a poor safety record.

His highest ranking is World No. 200, which was achieved on 18 August 2014. In September 2014, Yann Marti was called as fifth player and sparring partner for the Davis Cup semifinal Switzerland-Italy in Geneva together with Roger Federer, Stan Wawrinka, Marco Chiudinelli, and Michael Lammer. Although Marti ranked as the fourth Swiss player on the ATP (no. 209), Lammer (ATP 497) was preferred due to his qualities as doubles player. He had won the doubles partnering Chiudinelli in the first round in Serbia. Swiss Severin Lüthi said that due to the importance of the game against Italy, he would not proceed with any experiment with new players at this stage. Marti was allowed to wear the team uniform for the first time, and he stayed with the team during the whole week. Marti came very close to a nomination for the Davis Cup Final 2014 against France, when Federer was uncertain due to a back injury. Marti stayed in Switzerland, but was put on standby by the Swiss captain, in case he needed to replace Federer. He might have been preferred to Marco Chiudinelli and Michael Lammer, due to his better track record on clay. However, Federer's condition improved, and Marti was not nominated. In 2015, Marti was called to play the first round of the Davis Cup in Belgium as the team leader after Federer and Wawrinka decided not to play and after Chiudinelli was injured. He practiced during the whole week with the team (Lammer, Bossel, Laaksonen) but when the captain announced that Marti would not play the Friday singles, Marti decided to go back home to Switzerland and left the team. He said to the media that the fact that he was not picked for the singles was \\"the biggest disappointment of his career\\" and that it was better to go home now as he must play some ITF Future tournaments and as he would anyway not be of any help for the team at this stage. However, the Swiss Federation released a press statement according to which Marti was excluded from the team by the captain due to his bad behaviour after the draw. The true reasons for Marti's exclusion remain unclear, but his sudden leave was heavily criticized in Switzerland, as he left the team at very short notice and left them with only 3 available players for the tie (no substitute was nominated). Rumors of a physical altercation between Marti and Marco Chiudinelli started to circulate. Chiudinelli would have then informed the team captain that there was a \\"problem\\" with Marti. Wawrinka, who was not part of the team in Belgium, commented the events on his Twitter account by saying that \\"Marti talks too much\\". Roger Federer stated that he was briefed after the tie by the team captain and that Marti's behaviour was not acceptable and that it was very disappointing to see such things happen as it harmed the team. Switzerland lost the tie 3-2 and had to play the last decisive rubber with Adrien Bossel, a player ranked lower than Marti. The president of the Swiss Federation, René Stammbach, was extremely upset about Marti's behaviour and confirmed that Severin Lüthi had given the guarantee to Marti that he would have played on Sunday, which makes Marti's departure even less understandable. Stammbach further stated that \\"As long as I am president, Marti will never be called again for the Davis Cup.\\" In parallel, Marti's father and coach Jean-Marie attacked the Swiss Federation through the media and said that it was a matter of money and that the team was against Marti and still owes him money for his role as sparring partner in 2014. The Federation vehemently denied the claims of the Marti family. Marti was never called again for the Davis Cup.

Career  \\"I want to believe\\" – paste-up by Van Ray Van Ray's career began with public graffiti at the end of the 90s when he started using his art to communicate with the general public and to demonstrate social criticism. His works were based on various techniques (including stencils, stickers, paste-ups, and sculptures) and meant to express his view of Western society. After moving to Cologne in 2007, Van Ray became the founder of the artist collaboration 'fancyroom' which concentrated on textile designs by combining elements of graffiti and graphic design. The results were used for own textile collections and by several fashion brands. The collaboration dissolved in 2010.Van Ray, Instut Pierre Werner, 22 June 2014. Retrieved 22 June 2014. At this time the public art of Van Ray was attracting the attention of several gallery owners, offering him to present his street art in their exhibitions. Consequently, the artist finally agreed to a first gallery exhibition in the winter of 2010, presenting his \\"streets on wood\\"-series in the 30Works Gallery, Cologne. Due to his public work, several solo as well as group exhibitions, live shows, art festival appearances, and panel discussions, Van Ray has since then become one of the most famous German street artists. In the course of the 25th anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wall, he was invited by the Institut Pierre Werner to perform his art publicly during a live performance in Luxembourg. Techniques and themes Van Ray's work is characterized by its detailed stencils on mostly rusty vintage materials such as iron sheets, vending machines and enamel signs or wooden slats. The works nowadays reflect a fusion of street art and pop art, retaining the basic elements of his distinctive artistic style without losing sight of his intended social criticism.

Commonly known as the 'Oilbract Conebush' because of the brown, sticky, oily bracts found on both sexes when in bud, a feature setting it apart from other Leucadendron species. After flowering the bracts close, becoming hard and dry, forming a durable cone and protecting the enclosed flowerhead and heart-shaped fruits. This species produces hairless leaves some 90mm long, and bears beetle-pollinated yellow flowers in July and August - male (about 18mm diameter) and female (about 11mm diameter) being on separate plants. Male shrubs are rounded and up to 1.5m tall, while females are narrow-crowned and up to 2m tall. Involucral leaves are yellow.

Gwyllym Lloyd Wardle, 1809 portrait by Arthur William Devis Early life Born at Chester about 1762, he was the only son of Francis Wardle, J.P., of Hartsheath, near Mold, Flintshire, and Catherine, daughter of Richard Lloyd Gwyllym. He was during 1775 at Harrow School, but left in poor health; he was then at the school of George Henry Glasse at Greenford, near Ealing, Middlesex. He was admitted pensioner at St John's College, Cambridge, on 12 February 1780, but did not take a degree. After travelling on the continent of Europe, Wardle settled at Hartsheath. He went into business with William Alexander Madocks, in particular at Tremadog. Military career When Sir Watkin Williams-Wynn, 5th Baronet raised a troop of dragoons, officially called \\"the ancient British Light Dragoons\\",' and popularly known as \\"Wynn's Lambs\\", Wardle served in it, in Ireland. He is said to have fought at the battle of Vinegar Hill in 1798. At the peace of Amiens the troop was disbanded, and Wardle retired with the rank of lieutenant-colonel. National politics The Magical Note. Which Nobody Dictated, Nobody Wrote (caricature) Wardle moved to Green Park Place, Bath, Somerset, in about 1800, where he was living when elected Member of Parliament for in Devon in 1807. He won the election with 113 votes, and he is said to have been returned without the support of the borough's patron. According to a pamphlet by William Farquharson, he also had interests in a gin distillery in Jersey. As a result of the scandals arising from the relationship of Prince Frederick, Duke of York and Albany, the commander-in-chief of the army, with Mary Anne Clarke, Wardle brought forward a motion against the Duke on 27 January 1809. Acting with Sir Francis Burdett, Wardle was able, through parliamentary privilege, to fight against the government's libel action against the press, which aimed to prevent corruption rumours against the Duke from becoming public. The House of Commons went into committee on the subject on 1 February, and the proceedings lasted until 20 March. Though he failed in convicting the Duke of personal corruption, sufficient indiscretions were proved to force his retirement. Due to public interest in the case, Wardle briefly became more prominent than Burdett, who was otherwise a more substantial radical campaigner. Up to this point Wardle had been thought a bon viveur rather than a politician, but he remained committed to his cause. He made a long speech in parliament on 19 June 1809 on the public economy, and his resolutions on this were agreed. He was presented with the freedom of the city of London on 6 April 1809 and congratulatory addresses were presented to him by many corporations throughout the United Kingdom. His likeness was reproduced in a number of forms. On 3 July 1809, Wardle's fortunes changed for the worse, when an upholsterer called Francis Wright brought a court action against him over matters concerning the furnishing of Mary Anne Clarke's house. With the attorney-general prosecuting, the jury found against Wardle, and evidence came out that Clarke and Wardle had colluded against the Duke. Wardle denied this in an open letter, and on 11 December he brought an action against the Wrights and Clarke for conspiracy. He lost the case, along with his reputation, James Glenie, a witness for the crown in the first trial, was also heavily criticised by the judge Lord Ellenborough. Wardle's radical supporters included Timothy Brown, Major John Cartwright, William Cobbett, William Frend, and Robert Waithman. He was not re-elected for Okehampton after the dissolution of parliament in 1812, despite strong backing. Later life and death Wardle moved to a farm in Kent between Tunbridge and Rochester; Mary Anne Clarke wrote that he sold milk. Later, with money troubles, he emigrated. He died in Florence, on 30 November 1833, aged 71. Works An address from Colonel Wardle to his countrymen, arguing for Catholic Emancipation, was circulated in 1828. It was dated Florence, 3 November 1827, and praised conditions of life in Catholic Tuscany. Family In 1792 Wardle married Ellen Elizabeth Parry, daughter of Love Parry of Madryn, Carnarvonshire, who brought him estates in that county. They had seven children. He was an unfaithful husband.

About two- thirds of bombs detonated, with the remainder defused. Targets include banks (about a third of bombs), police stations, army barracks, churches, embassies, the headquarters of political parties, company offices, courthouses and government buildings. The bombs mostly detonate at night, and there have been few injuries amongst passers-by, none serious. The only fatality was a young anarchist, Mauricio Morales, who was killed in May 2009 by a bomb he was carrying. In 2011 another anarchist, Luciano Pitronello, was severely injured by a bomb he was planting. Claims of responsibility and Notable incidents The 27th march of 2009 and improvised bomb claimes responsibility for an improsived device which that was abandoned and denoted in a controlled explosion by members of the GOPE. The Explosive device were left in the window, in the offices newspaper \\"El Mercurio de Valparaíso\\", in the city of Valparaíso. The Brigadas Autónomas y Rebeldes Norma Vergara Cáceres\\" claimed responsibility for the incident, claiming that it was in honor of the death of Norma Vergara Caceres, a chilean guerrilla which were killed during an encounter against Carabineros de Chile. Around 80 different groups claimed responsibility for the attacks; authorities do not know if they are dealing with a group that continually changes its name, or many separate cells. Some groups name themselves after past anarchists worldwide, including Leon Czolgosz, who assassinated US President William McKinley in 1901, and Jean- Marc Rouillan, a jailed French left-wing militant. \\"The friends of gunpowder\\" has also been used. An Improvised explosive device blast near a mausoleum belonging to former Carabineros de Chile, near a police station, at the same time, a phone call alerted to the installation of a similar element on the north campus of the Catholic University of Temuco. An anarchists cell so called Lumpenes Destructivos-Rodrigo Donoso Jiménez - Jose Huenante claimed responsibility for the attack Between 9 and 10 September 2014, two improvised bombs exploded in the Chilean resort town of Vina del Mar. On the night of September 9, a bomb detonated inside a supermarket, injuring one woman. The bomb consisted of a plastic bottle filled with aluminum and hydrochloric acid, was placed inside a trash can. The bomb exploded after the local janitor attempted to empty the trash can. The second device detonated inside the Open Plaza mall's bathroom. On 25 September 2014, a home made explosive device detonated inside a man's bag while he was carrying it. The victim was later identified as 29-year-old Sergio Landskron Silva. In the aftermath of the explosion Silva remained engulfed in flames while laying on the sidewalk. Bystanders and policemen failed to assist the victim, fearing that a second explosive device remained in his bag. Silva was pronounced dead several minutes after being transferred to a hospital. According to Silva's brother, he has been living on the streets for a prolonged period of time, while struggling with drug addiction. Silva was allegedly planning to plant the bomb in the Yungay neighborhood of Santiago. On May 2, 2018 Members of Carabineros de Chile and the Fiscalía sur investigate an improvised explosive device abandoned in the metropolitan area of Santiago. The explosive did not explode and was destroyed by members of the anti-explosive unit. The group Individualistas Tendiendo a los Salvaje claim responsibility for this and other bombs that didn't detonate. On February 27 an makeshift explosive blast against a building in the comune of Vitacura, Santiago de Chile. The building belonging to a real estate company. The building were evacuated after registering a couple of explosions with thirty minutes apart, without leaving injuries.

Aftermath Several suspects were arrested and prosecuted, but most were acquitted. Injured bomber Pitronello was tried, but convicted only of lesser offences and sentenced to house arrest. Hans Niemeyer, a Chilean sociologist and anarchist, was sentenced to five years' imprisonment for planting a bomb in a bank in November 2011. Authorities were investigating links between anarchist groups in Chile and Europe. Two Chilean anarchists who had been tried and acquitted in Chile were later arrested in Spain, and charged with planting a bomb in a church in Zaragoza in 2013, an attack claimed by a group named after Mateu Morral, a Spanish anarchist who attempted to assassinate the King of Spain in 1906. In 2010 a letter bomb was addressed to the Chilean embassy in Athens. An opinion poll in 2014 found that about two-thirds of Chileans feared the attacks and felt that the problem was escalating, with nearly 30 bombs in 2014 by August.

Thermal credits are measured in percentages of global warming reduction in a given time.  Anthropogenic impact  The reduction of greenhouse gas GHG emissions is recognized by the major number of scientists, experts and politicians as the best strategy to stop global warming. However, there is an increasing number of experts affirming that these mechanisms would not have the desired CO2 reduction concentration effect in the atmosphere as the current emissions rhythm, neither the reduction of postpone a potential rise on the projected temperatures. The GHG emissions do not only impact human beings, other climate impacts such as changes to agriculture or fauna might be even more intense in local or regional scale. Therefore, the thermal credit is a broader concept that covers jointly mitigation and adaptation strategies in response to anthropogenic climate impact. The main effects of the major human activities impact on the climate are: \\\\- Net greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. \\\\- Radioactive changes in the physical properties of the soil cover.  Measuring climate impact  Thermal credits account the compensation effect of the temperature rise generated by both the reduction of emissions of greenhouse gases and the reduction in heat absorption by changes in physical properties of the use of land in specific projects. So, the thermal credits can be obtained from the development of those projects, technologies or actions that might cause a negative final variation of climate impact produced by itself. Therefore, in addition to including the mitigation strategies of the carbon credit system as the ultimate form of reducing the overall heat load of the atmosphere, it also includes other lines of action. These lines are based on adaptation strategies for local and regional climate impact, mainly those based on solar radiation management (SRM) through changes of use of the land surface. The number of thermal credits granted to a specific project to reduce climate impact quantifies the magnitude of reduction in climate impact, and it will depend on the amount of the estimated emissions reduction produced in each implemented solution, as each one of them contributes to the mitigation and adaptation to the climate change in a different way.  Related concepts  Climate footprint: is a measurement unit of the climate impact produced by a citizen or a firm in the climate system. It accounts for the percentage of the rise of temperatures caused by a person or company related to the global warming. Personal climate footprint is measured in a range from 0 to 5, whereas the climate footprint of a company usually will exceed this threshold. Climate impact: is the negative effect in terms of temperatures rising that a person or company produces in the climate system. Corporate Climate Responsibility: is the commitment of businesses to improve their environmental performance by taking actions with the goal of accomplishing environmental benefits in terms of climate impact saving. Climatically responsible companies are the ones taking actions to minimize their impact on the environment and continually improve their environmental performance.

Early life Born in 1919 in Pretoria, Benson served in the South African Women's Army during World War II. After the war, she was secretary to film director David Lean. Activism and writing Benson became acquainted with the author Alan Paton, and read his novel Cry, the beloved country (1948), whose main theme was racial discrimination in South Africa. This affected her greatly, and she became a campaigner for the rights of black people there. She worked with Michael Scott (who, in 1946, was the first white man to be jailed for resisting South Africa's racial laws), becoming his secretary in 1950. With Scott, Benson helped to found the African Bureau. In 1957, Benson was appointed secretary to the Treason Trial Defence Fund. In 1961, Benson took on another secretarial role, moving to Natal to assist Chief Albert Lutuli when he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize. Through all this work, Benson became familiar with the African National Congress (ANC). She assisted Nelson Mandela's escape from South Africa in 1962, and interviewed several prominent figures in the ANC, including Walter Sisulu and James Calata. Based upon these experiences, she wrote the first general history of the ANC: The African Patriots (Faber & Faber, London, 1964). She testified to the United Nations Committee on Apartheid in 1963, and was the first South African to do so. She was placed under house arrest and \\"banned\\" in 1966. She subsequently left the country and lived in exile, settling in London, England. Benson's biography of Nelson Mandela, Nelson Mandela: the Man and the Movement (1986), was the second biography of Nelson Mandela to be written. It was banned in apartheid South African upon its publication. Later life and death Benson was close friends with the playwright Athol Fugard. She edited his Notebooks 1960-1977 (Faber and Faber, 1983) and wrote Athol Fugard and Barney Simon: Bare Stage, a Few Props, Great Theater (Ravan Press, 1997). She appeared as a \\"castaway\\" on the BBC Radio programme Desert Island Discs on 16 February 1997. A few months prior to Benson's death, Nelson Mandela visited her at her flat in London. Benson died on 19 June 2000. Her papers, including correspondence with Semane Molotlegi and those relating to her biography of Tshekedi Khama, are archived in the Bodleian Library of Commonwealth and African Studies at Oxford.

JCORE delivers race-equality education for all ages, provides practical action to support refugees and asylum seekers, promotes Black-Asian-Jewish dialogue, and campaigns at all levels on race and asylum issues. It works with a number of other organisations to achieve this, including CCJO René Cassin, Hope not Hate, British Red Cross, Unite Against Fascism, The Baobab Centre for Young Survivors, The Children's Society, Freedom from Torture, The Refugee Council and the British Medical Association.http://www.bbc.co.uk/schools/gcsebitesize/rs/prejudice/judaismrev2.shtml History The Jewish Council for Racial Equality was founded in 1976 by Dr Edie Friedman. Originally named the Jewish Social Responsibility Council (JSRC), Dr Friedman wanted to create an organisation that would give full expression to the concern, as Jews, for justice both in the UK and in the Third World. As the JSRC developed, it became clear that it was more successful focussing on a few specific areas such as educating the Jewish community, developing Black-Jewish dialogue and working with refugees. To reflect more accurately the role of the organisation, the JSRC was renamed in 1994, becoming The Jewish Council for Racial Equality (JCORE). Mission The Jewish Council for Racial Equality believes that \\"a concern for social justice should be an integral part of Jewish identity and its relationship with the rest of society.\\" JCORE asserts that it is therefore necessary for Jews in the UK to speak out against racism and for the rights of asylum seekers and refugees because they know what happens when others stand by and do nothing. Work JCORE works in three main areas: =Race equality education= Educating both the Jewish community and beyond about issues of race equality.http://website.thejc.com/home.aspx?AId=6076&ATypeId;=1&search;=true2&srchstr;=%22jewish%20council%20for%20racial%20equality%22&srchtxt;=1&srchhead;=0&srchauthor;=0&srchsandp;=0&scsrch;=0 =Black-Asian-Jewish Dialogue= Promoting knowledge and understanding between different minority groups. Uniting various groups within society so that they might educate and enrich each other’s lives. Encouraging the commitment of the Jewish community to the above and stimulating their active involvement in its pursuit. =Refugees and asylum issues= Providing help and support to asylum seekers and those granted refugee status or leave to remain through the provision of donations, vocational training, advice and befriending. Advocating and campaigning at all levels to help alleviate suffering and poverty amongst asylum seekers in the UK and to encourage an approach that makes sure the UK abides by its international responsibility and the Refugee Convention.http://website.thejc.com/home.aspx?AId=22471&ATypeId;=1&search;=true2&srchstr;=%22jewish%20council%20for%20racial%20equality%22&srchtxt;=1&srchhead;=0&srchauthor;=0&srchsandp;=0&scsrch;=0 Encouraging the commitment of the Jewish community to the above and facilitating their active involvement in its pursuit. Current Projects JUMP In 2007 JCORE launched JUMP (JCORE Unaccompanied Minors Project). Inspired by the Kindertransport that brought Jewish children out of Germany and Austria to safety in Britain in 1938/39, JUMP brings together young asylum seekers and refugees with volunteer befrienders, offering support through one- to-one sessions and group activities.http://www.lloydsbankfoundation.org.uk/our-programmes/success- stories/jewish-council-for-racial-equalityhttp://www.thejc.com/node/21669 Refugee Doctors Mentoring Scheme Running since 2013, JCORE’s Refugee Doctors Mentoring Scheme pairs refugee doctors with UK-trained doctors who can mentor them and help them requalify so that they are able to practice in the UK. The project follows on from work JCORE has been doing since the 1980s to help refugee doctors in the UK. No Way To Live No Way to Live is a JCORE campaign to end the causes of destitution amongst asylum seekers. It is part of Still Human Still Here, a coalition of over 60 organisations that are dedicated to highlighting the plight of tens of thousands of refused asylum seekers in UK and campaigning to end destitution amongst them.

He originally trained as an architect, but then changed to art, studying at the Glasgow School of Art and, from 1881, at L’Ecole des Beaux Arts in Paris. Here he studied under Gustave Boulanger and Jean-Leon Gerome. In his time here he befriended William Kennedy, John Lavery, Thomas Millie Dow and William Stott. In the early 1880s he joined a colony of Scots artists in Grez-sur-Loing south of Fontainebleau. On his return to Scotland in 1885 he joined with the Glasgow Boys working on murals for the 1888 International Exhibition. In 1888 he travelled to Capriwhere he befriended Fabio Fabbi and Harold Speed.Calton Gallery: A I Roche In following years he visited both Venice and Florence, and married an Italian girl on the latter trip. This marriage was short-lived and they separated. As both were Catholics there seems to have never been any divorce. In 1896 he moved from Glasgow to Edinburgh and began to distance himself from the Glasgow Boys. His work drifted from largely landscape to largely portraits. In 1906 he remarried (possibly bigamously), to Jean Alexander, daughter of Robert Alexander. During this period they enjoyed the friendship of Joseph Crawhall. From 1907 until 1914 they lived at 8 Royal Terrace, on Calton Hill, a very prestigious property.

Nicknamed the \\"Mitochondria Man\\", he claimed that mitochondria, which are cell organelles, were once independent bacteria, as supported by his comparative studies and culture of isolated mitochondria. From 1922, he published a series of papers titled \\"On the nature of mitochondria\\" in the American Journal of Anatomy which became the experimental foundations of his claims. He was the first person to specifically postulate that eukaryotic organelles originated from bacteria, and that symbiosis is a major force in creation of new species. Wallin was Professor of Anatomy at the University of Colorado Medical School. He was noted for his eccentric life in academia, such as his preference for exclusively practical demonstration rather than lecturing, his frequent parties for students and an annual Christmas glogg party.  Biography  Wallin was born to Swedish immigrant parents, Claes Henvich (Henry) (Svensson) Wallin and Emma Augusta Maria (Johnsdotter) Johnson, in a small farming community at Stanton, Ohio. He was educated at Augustana College at Illinois and Princeton University. He obtained a BS degree from the University of Iowa in 1905. He briefly taught biology at the University of Nebraska from where he earned his MSc in 1908. In 1915 he obtained his doctorate degree (DSc) in anatomy from the New York University. His thesis was on the tissue development, differentiation, and morphology of the lamprey Ammocoete. From 1918, he was professor of anatomy at the University of Colorado Medical School.  Origin of mitochondria  Wallin was the first to experimentally investigate the origin of mitochondria, particularly in relation to their similarities with certain bacteria. His first paper in 1922 described the staining techniques for bacterial cells, and found that the techniques were equally good for staining mitochondria. He concluded that \\"bacteria and mitochondria have a similar chemical constitution\\". His subsequent paper (in the same year and same journal) further strengthened his assumptions. In addition, he observed in his study of blue green algae that chloroplasts are \\"bacteria or bacteria-like organisms that accepted the leisure of a symbiotic partnership in the struggle for existence\\". He made a summary conclusion that: Wallin was aware that he needed to culture mitochondria isolated from cell in an independent environment. His early experiment was a failure using tissue samples from guinea pig, dog, and human blood. However, he succeeded in obtaining a mitochondrial culture with liver of fetal and newborn rabbits. He reported his findings in 1924 with a remark that \\"mitochondria are, in reality, bacterial organisms, symbiotically combined with the tissues of higher organisms.\\" He continued with prolific publications. The series of his papers titled \\"On the nature of mitochondria\\" reached nine in 1925. He gave a full description of his experiments and theories on mitochondria in his 1927 book Symbionticism and the Origin of Species. Although he claimed that his experiments were performed with utmost care, critics rejected them on the grounds of possible contamination, and Wallin and his works were largely forgotten, until Lynn Margulis introduced a more complete endosymbiotic theory with better evidences in 1967.  Personal life  Wallin married Eva Louise Shepard. Wallin was known for his eccentric behaviour in his professional life. He avoided lecturing, but instead used practical demonstrations. He frequently organised parties for his students, who in return helped him build a cabin in North St. Vrain Canyon, 20 miles north of Boulder. The parties were simply named \\"Club Wallin\\" which involved heavy drinking beside playing games. His notable habit was holding an annual Christmas glogg party. At the party guests were treated with Swedish delicacies such as sillsalladen (pickled herring salad), lutefisk (dried codfish), and mulled wine.

Processing  Use-orientated, the connection will be done by either flaring or retaining ring technology. Flaring Technology After putting a F37 flange onto a seamless hydraulic tube or pipe, the tube end will be flared to 37°, what also explains the name of this technology. The flaring is done by a special orbitally flaring process, which compresses the surface of the pipe end, gaining an excellent sealing surface. An insert made of carbon or stainless steel will be placed into the flared pipe end. The insert is soft sealed by an O-Ring to the pipe side. To be sealed against a flat counterpart (e.g. manifold or block) the insert has a groove on the front side for a so-called \\"F37-Seal\\" made of Polyurethane or optionally an o-ring or bonded seal made of carbon steel or stainless steel with a Nitrile rubber or FKM sealing lip. Alternatively, the front side of the insert can be flat. For a pipe to pipe connection, a special insert design with soft sealed cones on both sides to fit between two flared pipe ends is available. Afterwards, the flange will be positioned to the pipe end and connected to a hydraulic component or another pipe having a similar flange and corresponding insert. Retaining Ring Technology For the Retaining Ring connection, a groove will be machined onto the pipe end to hold the retaining ring. The retaining ring is made of a segmented stainless steel ring covered by a steainless steel spring and is used to fix the flange. For the assembly, the retaining ring flange has to be put onto the machined pipe end. The retaining ring has to be widened for getting it on the pipe end to snap into the before machined groove. The inside contour of the retaining ring flange will cover the retaining ring from the outside. The sealing of the Parflange F37 retaining ring connection is done by a bonded seal on the face side of the pipe end or alternatively by a pipe seal carrier (\\"PSC\\"). The pipe seal carrier has soft seales (o-rings or F37-Seals) on both sides. On one side, the pipe seal carrier has a centering aid to improve assembly.  Functionality  Illustration of a Parflange F37 Flare Flange Connection Illustration of a Parflange F37 Retaining Ring Connection Flaring Technology By flaring the pipe end, the flange gets a supporting surface and is able to build up force to ensure a stable connection. At first, the insert has a sealing function. With its o-ring on the pipe end side, the sealing against the pipe is achieved. The sealing against the connecting part is done by the F37-Seal or a bonded seal. If the connecting part has a soft seal on the face side, an insert with a flat face has to be used. For the connection of two pipes, an insert with cones on both sides, which are soft sealed by o-rings, can be used as well. Simultaneously, the insert stabilises the connection. The achieved pressure by tightening the flange bolts can be spread on a bigger contact surface of the insert, increasing the solidity of the connection. Retaining Ring Technology The special inside contour of the retaining ring flange covers the retaining ring, which is installed onto the machined pipe end. A form-closed connection results from the tightening of the flange, which will be sealed by bonded seal or pipe seal carrier on the face side.  Application  The Parflange F37 system is used to connect haydraulic tubes, pipes and components without welding. Depending on pipe and flange size, the F37 system is approved for pressure ratings up to 420 bar (6000 psi, respectively 42 MPa). It is commonly used in shipbuilding, offshore and heavy machinery industry for moving and controlling of e.g. cranes and elevators. Furthermore, the Parflange F37 technology allows to connect tubes and pipes from 16 to 273 millimeter outside diameter (1/2\\" to 10\\" flange size).  Approvals  The F37 system is approved by leading classification societies. The flange hole patterns are according to ISO 6162-1/SAE J 518 Code 61 (3000 psi/210 bar), ISO 6162-2/SAE J518 Code 62 (6000 psi/420 bar) and ISO 6164 (400 bar).  Other information  Advantages of Parflange F37 compared to welded flange connections are mainly in savings on time and costs. No costly inspection of welds (f.e. by x-ray graphing) and post-weld acid cleaning is needed, making the connection also more environment-friendly and safer then welding. Compared to welding, no welding stress corrosion is possible, resulting in maximum service time of the pipe connection and a reduction of service costs.

Previously occupied by St John's Church and its graveyard between 1769 and 1931, the site was redeveloped into a formal garden in 1932. It contains a central memorial to the church and those buried in its graveyard, whose tombstones have been covered over by of soil except for that of John Owens, founder of Owen's College. The garden was awarded a Green Flag in 2012 and is part of the St John Street conservation area. Background St John's Church, Manchester St John's Church was built on the site now occupied by the gardens in 1769 in response to the needs of a rapidly rising population. Its founder was Edward Byrom (13 June 1724 – 24 April 1773), a co-founder of the first bank in Manchester and the oldest surviving son of John Byrom, whose family was well known in the area. The residential area around the church changed in character during the 19th century, as properties once occupied by affluent families became lodging houses and the locale became a place of business. Falling attendances led to a merger with St Matthew's parish in 1927. In 1929, the Ecclesiastical Commissioners proposed to hand over the site to Manchester Corporation, in the hope that it would be converted into an open space similar to Parsonage Gardens. The church was demolished in 1931. Garden In March 1914, Manchester Corporation was negotiating with the Ecclesiastical Commissioners to turn St John's dreary city-centre churchyard from an \\"eyesore\\" to a garden planted with trees and shrubs. The church is commemorated by a stone cross in the garden; a plaque states that more than 22,000 bodies lie buried in the vicinity. Among those buried in the churchyard are John Owens, founder of Owens College, the forerunner of Manchester University, and William Marsden, who successfully campaigned for the introduction of a half-day holiday for workers on Saturdays. With the exception of Owens' grave, the tombstones in the churchyard were covered with of soil. A garden and children's playground was formally opened on 10 February 1932. The Black or Manchester Poplar, Populus nigra (subspecies betulifolia), Britain's most endangered native tree, was planted in the garden. Like the London Plane, the only other British tree named after a city, it is one of the few trees that can survive in heavily polluted conditions. In 2011 an orchard of twelve crab apple trees and wildflowers designed by Daniela Coray, was moved to the garden after the RHS Tatton Park Flower Show. Coray, RHS National Young Designer of the Year, had been awarded a gold award for the design, A Stitch in Time Saves Nine. The garden was awarded a Green Flag in 2012 for promoting a \\"welcoming, safe and well-maintained\\" environment. and is in the St John Street conservation area.

During the 1960s and 1970s he was involved with a variety of avant-garde art projects, including a 1969 film by sculptor John Chamberlain (\\"The Secret Life of Hernando Cortez\\"). In the late 1970s Leffingwell left New York to take care of his mother, who was ill, and began to transition to a curatorial career in the arts. He entered Youngstown State University, completing a B.A. in 1982, and went on in 1984 to earn an M.A. in art history from the University of Cincinnati. In 1985 he was hired by PS1, now affiliated with New York's Museum of Modern Art. Leffingwell organized a number of key exhibitions, including two while he was in school.

In 2007 during the interview of Shimon Peres by Hellenic Broadcasting Corporation on George Dalaras concert in Israel, President Peres stated: \\"In Israel we love the Greek Music. For us Greece is a country but also a melody\\". History Greek-style bouzouki music became increasingly popular in the early 1960s. Aris San, a non-Jewish Greek singer who moved to Israel and became an Israeli citizen, was the driving spirit behind this trend. One of Aris San's hit songs was \\"Sigal\\" (lyrics by Yovav Katz). Aris San, who worked at the Zorba club in Jaffa, owned and opened by Shlomo Bachramov wrote songs for Aliza Azikri (Bahayim hakol over, Yesh ahava ata omer), that effectively broke down the barriers between Israeli song and the world of Greek and Mizrahi music. The songs of the iconic Greek singer Stelios Kazantzidis were translated into Hebrew and performed by the country's leading singers. Many of the songs of Stelios Kazantzidis have been translated into Hebrew and performed by Israeli singers. Yaron Enosh, an Israeli Radio broadcaster who often plays Greek music on his programs, described the singer's ability to combine joy with sorrow: \\"This is the task of music: to touch the entire range of feelings...Kazantzidis could do this; he played on all the strings.\\" The Greek pillar of Israeli music, Haaretz To the Greek Jews who immigrated to Israel, Kazantzidis was \\"the voice of the world they left behind, for good or for bad.\\" According to the operator of Radio Agapi, a station that plays Greek music 24 hours a day, \\"Kazantzidis was the voice of the people, of the weary, the exploited, the betrayed. And the voice of the refugee and the emigre, too.\\" Glykeria during a concert held in Rishon Le- Zion, September 2013 Greek music day A special broadcasting day of Greek classical and modern music was organised on 12 June 2013 by the Israel Broadcasting Authority, in cooperation with the Embassy of Greece in Tel Aviv.

Don't fill more than a page and a half with apologies for not having written sooner! The best subject, to begin with, is your friend's last letter. *3rd Rule. Don’t repeat yourself. *4th Rule. When you have written a letter that you feel may possibly irritate your friend, however necessary you may have felt it to so express yourself, put it aside till the next day. Then read it over again, and fancy it addressed to yourself. *5th Rule. If your friend makes a severe remark, either leave it unnoticed, or make your reply distinctly less severe: and if he makes a friendly remark, tending towards \\"making up\\" the little difference that has arisen between you, let your reply be distinctly more friendly. *6th Rule. Don’t try to have the last word! *7th Rule. If it should ever occur to you to write, jestingly, in dispraise of your friend, be sure you exaggerate enough to make the jesting obvious: a word spoken in jest, but taken as earnest, may lead to very serious consequences. *8th Rule. When you say, in your letter, \\"I enclose cheque for £5,\\" or \\"I enclose John’s letter for you to see,\\" leave off writing for a moment—go and get the document referred to—and put it into the envelope. Otherwise, you are pretty certain to find it lying about, after the Post has gone! *9th Rule. When you get to the end of a notesheet, and find you have more to say, take another piece of paper—a whole sheet, or a scrap, as the case may demand: but whatever you do, don’t cross!

It is in part a response to the 2010 report Making Space for Nature by Sir John Lawton. The project, located at Wakehurst Place, in West Sussex, in the High Weald of southern England (), is dedicated to enhancing the resilience and coherence of the UK's ecological networks by improving the quality, quantity, and diversity of UK seed species available for use in conservation, rehabilitation, and restoration projects.Kew website \\"Restoring Native Plants in the UK: 5 Questions for Kew Scientist Michael Way\\", Encyclopædia Britannica Blog, 23 September 2011, accessed 23 August 2014\\"Kew launches native flowers project at Wakehurst Place\\", BBC News, Sussex, including 3:00 film clip, 17 August 2011, accessed 23 August 2014 The UKNSH makes available to conservation and restoration projects high quality Millennium Seed Bank seed collections, some of which are of species that are not available on the commercial seed market, and some are local provenance collections of species already available. As part of the Royal Botanic Gardens, the UKNSH is a nonprofit organization UKNSH License Agreement which provides seeds under a license agreement, ensuring use of the seed only for projects that directly support UK biodiversity and at a charge that only recoups the financial cost of recollection to replace seeds in the bank. The provision of seed may be accompanied by technical training, advice and research that enable users of the seed and other commercial seed suppliers to improve the knowledge, use, and storage of native seed in the UK.Kew consultancy History In 2011 the Esmée Fairbairn Foundation gave £750,000 to the Royal Botanical Gardens, Kew to establish the UKNSH as part of the foundation's 50th Birthday celebrations.Esmée Fairbairn Foundation The funding was expected to establish the project over a period of four years.\\"Kew sets up 'UK seed hub' to restore wild flower meadows\\", Louise Gray, The Telegraph, 2011 Production began at the Wakehurst place nursery in 2011. In 2012 seed production moved to the new production beds that are on display to the public at Wakehurst Place. Production focused on regenerating grassland species such as Campanula rotundifolia (harebell) and Genista tinctoria (dyer’s greenweed) from seed in the Millennium Seed Bank's collections. In May 2014 suitable seed from the Millennium Seed Bank’s collections were made available by the UKNSH seed online list, making it possible for legitimate conservation projects to request seed from the available UKNSH collections. The Seed Hub The Seed Hub itself is the Wakehurst Place based production site, with a capacity of 28 beds on about a hectare of land in total, close to the Millennium Seed Bank building and the Visitor Centre (and shown on the visitor's map).Wakehurst Visitors' Map PDF, accessed 23 August 2014 The site began construction in 2011 and is maintained by Kew’s horticultural staff. Seed production is focused on species that are difficult to obtain on the commercial market, due to harvesting, germination, or processing difficulties. Species are often regenerated to create a large collection of seeds of a particular UK provenance, such as the South Downs’ Primula veris (cowslip), or from a particular environmental habitat.\\"Kew unveils native flower seed bank\\", Camila Ruz, The Guardian, 17 August 2011, accessed 23 August 2014 The site is also open to the public as part of a visit to Wakehurst, and provides a useful environment to observe and photograph plant pollinators. The Seed List To support UK conservation and restoration projects the UKNSH makes the Millennium Seed Bank's high quality, UK origin seeds available to legitimate initiatives aiming to improve the UKs ecological network. A few of these collections are supplied from the production beds at Wakehurst Place with some being made available from the suitable collections seed bank at the MSBP. Seed is only provided from appropriate collections in the MSBP when the collection is sufficiently large. Where there is not sufficient seed numbers to make a collection available for distribution the species may be bulked up on the production beds. All seed provided is “F1” generation in that is it the offspring of plants harvested from seeds collected directly from the wild. The seed list operates in such a way that the provision of seed to conservation projects will never completely deplete the collection in the bank. Support The UKNSH also provides a range of training for seeds producers, collectors, and users. This support ensures that seed users understand the importance of high quality seed of a UK origin for UK conservation work, as well as providing them with the skills needed to use the seed. The support also ensures that appropriate species and provenance seeds are used for the projects location and habitat. Support covers the entire range of seed handling from harvesting, through processing, testing, and storage, to distribution, and sowing. The aim of this support is to improve best practice in UK native seed use. The UKNSH provides advice and services through consultancy to enable the continuation of the project beyond the four year funding of the Esmée Fairbairn Foundation.

His studied ancient Indian culture and the history of Hinduism. A report in The Hindu stated that he has published over forty research papers in various journals and contributed to the Andhra Pradesh History Congress besides guiding eight PhD students. Prior to his appointment as ICHR chairperson in 2014, Rao was a relatively unknown historian, who had not published articles in peer-reviewed journals. His publications were pieces in the popular media about the historicity of Indian epics. = ICHR = Rao was a member of the Indian Council of Historical Research (ICHR) during the first NDA government led by the Bharatiya Janata Party. In July 2014, the National Democratic Alliance government re-inducted Rao into ICHR and appointed him chairperson. After serving as chairperson for 16 months, Rao was reported to have submitted a resignation from his position on 24 November 2015, citing personal reasons. However, the government did not accept the resignation.HRD may ask Y Sudershan Rao to remain ICHR chief, The Indian Express, 2 April 2016. The ICHR describes him as having been chairperson from July 2014 to July 2017. Rao also served as head of the Andhra Pradesh chapter of Akhil Bharatiya Itihas Sankalan Yojana (ABISY), a subsidiary organisation of Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, devoted to rewriting Indian history from a Hindu nationalist perspective. In March 2015, three other ABISY-affiliated historians were nominated as members to the Council at the recommendation of Rao. The appointments, as well as Rao's, were described by commentators as an effort by the Modi administration to fill government institutions with individuals ideologically aligned with the RSS, as part of an effort at saffronisation. Rao's tenure at the ICHR was subject to sharp criticism. Under Rao, the council chose to dissolve the advisory committee for the journal it published, that had been composed of several well-known historians. Gopinath Ravindran, another ICHR member, resigned from the committee in 2015, stating that Rao was running it in an autocratic manner, and stating that most of the committee had no scholarly credentials. Rao also announced plans to study whether Adam's Bridge was a man-made structure, but Arvind Jamkhedkar, his successor as ICHR chairperson, stated that they would not be pursued.  Views and reception  Rao expressed the belief that the Hindu epics, the Ramayana and the Mahabharata, were accurate accounts of Indian history. Following his appointment to the ICHR, he promised to prove the historicity of those epics during his tenure. In 2007, Rao stated that the Indian caste system worked well and was not a discriminatory institution. Reacting to his appointment as ICHR chairperson, historian Romila Thapar questioned the academic rigor of Rao's work, and stated that Rao's lack of peer-reviewed publications meant his work had little visibility to historians. Thapar went on to describe Rao's intentions to of ascribing historicity about the Hindu epics as a futile endeavor. She wrote that Rao, like many other Hindutva ideologues, did not understand what Marxist historiography was, and called any research that ran contrary to the goals of Hindu nationalism \\"Marxist\\". His appointment as ICHR chairperson was also criticized by other eminent historians including D. N. Jha, and by former members of the ICHR, including from right-wing historians. An Outlook article noted that he was a scarcely cited scholar with no established track-record and that his blog-posts on different aspects of the subject, which frequently delineated the boundaries between myth and history and ran on a course of faith alone, have only caused concern among academics. The historian Ramachandra Guha described him as a right wing ideologue, who did not recognize the difference between history and myth.

In literary circles he became unpopular by satirising Lord Byron. Life Clarke was born in Maryport, Cumberland, and went to work for a Mr. Huntley, a chemist and druggist, in Gateshead. His early journalism brought him support from William Burdon, and a sizarship at Emmanuel College, Cambridge. He left Cambridge without a degree, and went to London, where he edited The Scourge, a monthly publication, contributed to The Satirist, and engaged in jobbing literary work. There was doubt at the time as to the date of Clarke's death, with Eneas Mackenzie in 1827 asserting that he was already dead, \\"unnoticed and unlamented\\". Richard Welford in Men of Mark 'twixt Tyne and Tweed (1895) claimed he died in 1817. Letters to Richard Alfred Davenport from Canada show he had emigrated, and was in Chambly, Quebec in 1845. Works Clarke contributed to the Tyne Mercury a series of papers, later expanded and published in The Saunterer (Newcastle, 1805, 2nd ed. 1806).

Biography  Born in Paris, daughter of the police commissioner Eugène Descaves (brother of the writer Lucien Descaves) and goddaughter of Camille Saint-Saëns, Lucette Descaves studied piano, encouraged by her mother. She entered the Paris Conservatoire while Gabriel Fauré was the director, in the class of Marguerite Long. Having won first prize for piano in 1923, she was herself put in charge of Long's preparatory class (during the Second World War, she taught the young student Michel Legrand, who in 1988 asked her to appear in his autobiographical film Cinq Jours en Juin). Subsequently, she became Yves Nat's teaching assistant. Lucette Descaves was regarded by Marguerite Long as her spiritual heir. In 1941, Descaves was made a piano professor at the Conservatoire. As a pianist, she has premiered works by Jolivet (ritual dances, 1942 Concerto for piano, 1951) and Rivier (Concerto for Piano, 1954). Until her retirement from the Conservatoire in 1976, she taught several outstanding pianists, including Jean-Yves Thibaudet, Geneviève Joy, Brigitte Engerer, Pascal Rogé, Katia and Marielle Labèque, Géry Moutier and Georges Pludermacher. Upon retirement of the Conservatory, she continued her teaching at the Rueil-Malmaison conservatory, directed by one of her former students, Jacques Taddei. She also had a career as a concert soloist, performing under conductors such as Philippe Gaubert, Charles Münch and Andre Cluytens. She performed and premiered much contemporary music, most notably works by André Jolivet (Cinq danses rituelles, the Piano Concerto) and Jean Rivier. She also performed works by Gabriel Pierné and Bohuslav Martinů, and performed Sergei Prokofiev's Third Piano Concerto before the composer on 25 October 1931 at the Concerts Poulet. She studied the complete piano works of Albert Roussel and Arthur Honegger with the composers before recording them on LP. She was first married to the conductor and pianist Georges Truc (died 1941), artistic director of Pathé-Marconi France; she then married the conductor Louis Fourestier.

With its many shades of blue and the sunlight pouring through the window, the painting is one of her most prominent works. Background The Skagen Painters were a close-knit group of mainly Danish artists who gathered each summer from the late 1870s in the fishing village of Skagen in the far north of Jutland, painting the local fishermen and their own gatherings and celebrations. Anna Ancher née Brøndum, the daughter of the local innkeeper, was the only member of the group from Skagen itself. Inspired by the works of the artists who spent their summers at the inn, she decided to take up painting as a profession at a time when women were not admitted to the Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts. In 1880, she married Michael Ancher, one of the most productive members of the group. Unlike the other painters who depicted the local fishermen and landscapes captured en plein air, Anna's works were mainly interiors and portraits of friends and family. Painting description As indicated by its full title: Sunshine in the Blue Room. Helga Ancher Knitting in Grandmother's Parlour (Solskin i den blå stue. Helga Ancher ved strikketøjet i bedstemoders stue), the painting depicts Anna's daughter Helga knitting in her grandmother's room. With her back to the observer, the child is busy crocheting. Despite its everyday subject, the painting is one of Anna Ancher's most captivating masterpieces with its many shades of blue and the sense of tranquility it conveys. Devoid of action, the theme is essentially the play of light in the room. The only indication of the outside world is the light streaming through the window. Mette Bøgh Jensen, curator of Skagens Museum, explains that Anna Ancher's interior paintings are \\"more about the colour and light than anything else\\". The artist's main interest is \\"not in replicating the reality of the room or wall, or even the light, but rather what is left when these things are stripped away and all that remains are colour and form\\". Bøgh Jensen continues, \\"Anna Ancher's art is unlike that of anyone else. In its essence it is tied to the special world of motifs in Skagen: the fishermen's families, the harvesters, the heathers, the special colours, and the brilliant summer light.\\" In her Concise Dictionary of Women Artists, Delia Gaze assesses Anna Ancher's achievements as remarkable \\"in the modernity of her idiom, with its reduced, abstracting forms and bold expressive colours, singling her out as one of the most innovative painters of her generation, exceeding most of her male colleagues, including her husband\\".

Painting  The painting shows a tastefully dressed young man in a floppy hat seated in a chair facing right with his head at an angle looking at the viewer. We don't know the name of the man or the occasion for which it was painted, but the painting is probably a pendant to the portrait of a man in a black jacket, which it matches in shape, size, period, and position of the figures. If so, it was possibly once a pair of portraits of organisation owners, or two men who lived together, because Hals was quite consistent with his pendant wedding portraits; positioning the man on the left and the woman on the right. This allowed the light which always shines from the left in his paintings, to shine directly on the woman's face and not the man's. In this case however, the portrait on the left is painted in lighter tones than the portrait on the right. Possibly these pendant portraits were made to decorate a building, so that people who worked for them or visited the premises could know what the owners looked like. File:Frans Hals - Portrait of a Man - WGA11126.jpg File:Frans Hals - portrait of a man in a black jacket c 1633.jpg Provenance The painting is one of the best documented paintings in Hals' oeuvre, documented by Wilhelm von Bode in 1883, by Ernst Wilhelm Moes in 1909, Hofstede de Groot in 1910, by W.R. Valentiner in 1923, Trivas in 1941 and by Gerrit David Gratama in 1946. Both Seymour Slive and Claus Grimm agree it is by Hals.

Written after the disillusionment of the 1987 general election, Bragg describes \\"Great Leap Forwards\\" as \\"my way of owning up to the ambiguities of being a political pop star while stating clearly that I still believed in Sam Cooke's promise that a change was gonna come\\". According to Bragg's biographer Andrew Collins, the song \\"pulls off the difficult trick of boiling down the whole pop-and-politics-don't-mix argument\\", one that Bragg, as a left-wing singer/songwriter would often have had.

Left: Satan appears as a fine burgher, and Haizmann signs a pact with ink. Right: The Devil reappears a year later and forces Haizmann to sign another pact with his own blood. Middle: The Virgin Mary makes the Devil to return the second pact during an exorcism. Johann Christoph Haizmann (1651/52 – 14 March 1700) was a Bavarian-born Austrian painter who is known for his autobiographically depicted demonical neurosis. The so-called Haizmann case has been studied in psychology and psychiatry since the early twentieth century, especially by Sigmund Freud and Gaston Vandendriessche. Early life Christoph Haizmann was born in Traunstein, Bavaria, in 1651 or 1652. Pacts Little is known about him before 1677. He was an impoverished painter, and when he lost a parent, he allegedly sold his soul to the devil in 1668, to be his bounden son for nine years; after that time, Haizmann’s body and soul were to belong to the devil. Haizmann claimed that he gave two pacts to the devil, one written in ink and other in his own blood. Exorcisms However, in 1677, when the pacts were due, he became anxious and made a pilgrimage to Mariazell, and after a successful exorcism, the pact in blood was given back to him by the devil. As the demonic infestations continued, Haizmann concluded that another exorcism was necessary to retrieve also the pact on ink; that happened in 1678. Painting Haizmann painted several pictures of the appearances of the devil (a triptych and a series of eight portraits with captions) and kept a diary of his visions. Later life and death After his demonical neurosis, Haizmann became a Brother Hospitaller. He died in 1700 in Neustadt an der Mettau in Bohemia (currently Nové Město nad Metují in Czech). Manuscript record and research To preserve the details of the successful exorcism, a manuscript, partly in Latin, partly in German, was composed sometime between 1714 and 1729, titled Trophæum Mariano-Cellense. It was rediscovered in the archive in the early 1920s, and Sigmund Freud was the first to analyze it in an article entitled “A Seventeenth-Century Demonological Neurosis” (1923). After him, several other writers have discussed the case. The most extensive research (including two books) has probably been carried out by the Belgian psychologist Gaston Vandendriessche; other notable writers include Michel de Certeau and H. C. Erik Midelfort. A facsimile of the Trophæum Mariano-Cellense manuscript, along with an English translation, colour illustrations and critique of Freud, was published in 1956 by Ida Macalpine and Richard A. Hunter: Schizophrenia, 1677: A Psychiatric Study of an Illustrated Autobiographical Record of Demoniacal Possession. Haizmann in popular culture In 2003, a low-budget horror mockumentary Searching for Haizmann was released. According to the storyline of this movie, Haizmann, as the son of the devil, is the Anti-Christ, and he didn’t die in 1700 but was smuggled to America and he still lives there.

The first Michelin prize was announced in March 1908. The principal prize, to be awarded annually for an initial period of eight years, was a prize for long distance flight, and consisted of a bronze statue as a trophy (valued at 10,000 FF-French francs) and a money prize of 20,000 FF. The flying club of the winner also received a replica of the trophy if they did not already own one. Administration and determination of the exact conditions for each year were delegated to the Aéro-Club de France (AeCF). Attempts to win the prize could be made anywhere in the world where there was a flying club associated with the AeCF. At the same time, Prix d'Aviation Michelin was a special prize of 100,000 francs offered for a flight by an aircraft carrying a passenger, taking off from either the department of Seine or Seine-et-Oise, flying over the Arc de Triomphe and the cathedral of Clermont-Ferrand, and landing on the summit of the Puy de Dôme inside six hours starting from the time at the Arc de Triomphe. This was won by Eugène Renaux on 7 March 1911, flying a Maurice Farman biplane. In 1909, a second award, the British Empire Michelin Cup, was announced, for flights made by aviators who were citizens of the British Empire, flying aircraft of all-British manufacture. The original award therefore became known as the International Michelin Cup. When the prizes were first instituted, 25 French francs were worth one pound Sterling. International Michelin Cup =1908= Won by Wilbur Wright with a flight made on 31 December 1908 at Le Mans officially reckoned as . The course over which the flight was made was an isosceles triangle with two sides of 1 km and a third of 200 m, totalling 2.2 km. The flight had to be made before sunset and only complete circuits counted. Wright took off at 2 pm and completed 56 circuits before sunset. He then landed, flying a further 1.5 km to set a new world distance record of 124.7 km. =1909= For the greatest distance exceeding 123.2 km. in a closed circuit made before the end of the year: 20,000 francs, and a bronze replica of the Michelin trophy. Won by Henry Farman with a flight of lasting 4h 6m 25s made on 3 November 1909 at Chalons. =1910= Won by Maurice Tabuteau flying a Maurice Farman biplane with a flight of , taking 7hr 48m 36.6s at Buc on 30 December 1910. =1911= In 1911, the closing date for the competition was brought forward to 31 October. Won by E. Helen flying a Nieuport II monoplane on 8 September 1911, when he covered in 14 hr 7 min. =1912= For the 1912 competition, the rules were considerably elaborated. The flight had to be made over a course made up of three different circuits, each starting from the same point. The first and third, each of about , had to have three or four compulsory landing-places, and the second, of , one or two landing places. Refuelling was only allowed at the starting point of each circuit. The circuits had to be covered in order, and if a competitor landed somewhere other than a nominated airfield, they had to start that circuit again. For every 75 kg of useful load carried apart from the pilot and necessary fuel, a bonus of 25% was allowed on the time, up to a maximum of 100 per cent. The extra load could be made up of passengers or ballast. Competing aircraft had to carry a sealed barograph, and an average speed of at least had to be maintained. The 1912 prize was not won by any competitor, and the prize money was added to the prize for the following year. =1913= The 1913 competition was very different. It was awarded for the greatest distance flown on a series of consecutive days, flying over a course, with a compulsory landing after each circuit. The Cup was won by Emmanuel Helen flying a Nieuport monoplane, with a total distance of flown between 22 October and 29 November 1913. =1914= The nature of the competition was changed again for the 1914 competition, the prize being awarded for the fastest time over a circuit of about . Won by Eugène Gilbert flying a Morane- Saulnier monoplane. Starting from Villacoublay at 03:04 on 8 June 1914, he flew via Peronne, Rheims, Saint-Dizier, Gray, Joigny, Beaune, Vienne and Nimes, landing at Mirande before reaching Pau, owing to running out of fuel. On the next day he flew via Pau, St. André de Cubzac, Romorantin, Angers, Evreux and Calais back to Villacoublay, landing at 18:37 p.m, having covered a distance of in 39h 35m. =1921= After the First World War, the competition was resumed in 1921.

The result was the cause of considerable controversy. The best French time was achieved by Alphonse Poiré flying a Caudron C.60, who completed the circuit in 37h 23m. A faster time of 35h 45m over an Italian circuit was achieved by Capt Raffaele Martinetti- Bianchi,L'Aéreophile 1-15 octobre 1921 but he had not landed at the same aerodrome as he had departed from, since this had become waterlogged and he was not allowed to land there. The dispute between the Italian authorities, who had ratified his performance, and the Aéro-Club de France was taken to a specially appointed Fédération Aéronautique Internationale committee, which found in Martinetti's favour, but the AeCF disputed their judgement: eventually the prize was held to have been won by neither man, although in recognition of his performance the AeCF awarded the Gold Medal of the AeCF and a sum of money equal to the Michelin Prize to Poiré. =1922-3= A five-year extension, with annual prizes of 20,000 francs, was announced in 1922. The time period of the annual competition was altered to run from the beginning of July in one year to the end of the following June.

The best time was achieved by Capt. Coslin, with Lieut Gérard as observer, with a time of 18h 0m 24s, a speed of . However, since this time did not better the previous best, the cup did not change hands. =1926-7= There were two competitions in 1926-7, one restricted to the Breguet 19. The course for both competitions was Paris (Le Bourget)--Nancy--Metz--Strasbourg--Dijon-- Bourges--Clermont-Ferrand--Lyons--Istres--Pau--Casaux--Châteauroux--Tours-- Romorantin--Chartres--Paris, a distance of .

The winning flight had to be made in France, although the competition was open to all nationalities, and the competition was restricted to single-seater aircraft with an engine of 230 hp or less. A minimum average speed of had to be maintained over the circuit, including time spent on the ground at the fifteen cities making up the circuit. Won by Michel Détroyat, flying a Morane-Saulnier MS.230. =1929-30= Won by Michel Détroyat, flying a Morane-Saulnier MS.130, completing the course Paris (Le Bourget)--Reims--Nancy-- Strasbourg--Dijon-- Clermont-Ferrand--Lyons--Montpellier-- Perpignan--Toulouse--Pau--Bordeaux-- Tours--Le Bourget at an average speed of . =1930-31= Won by Marcel Haegelen flying the Lorraine-Hanriot LH.41, with a time of 11h 37m 21s, an average speed of . =1931-2= Won by Marcel Haegelen flying the Lorraine- Hanriot LH 41, completing the course at an average speed of on 23 June 1932. =1932-3= Won by Michel Détroyat flying a Moraine Saulnier MS.234, completing the course at an average speed of . =1934= =1935= Won by Maurice Arnoux flying a Caudron C.430/1, completing the course in 10h 7m, a speed of .

S F Cody shortly after winning his first Michelin Trophy in 1910 Won by Samuel Cody flying the Cody Michelin Cup Biplane at Laffan's Plain, Farnborough with a flight of taking 4h 47m. =1911= Announcement of a second prize, to be competed for during the following three years, with a trophy and a cash prize of £400 for 1911, £600 for 1912 and £800 for 1913, for the fastest time over a cross- country circuit. On 29 October 1911, the Michelin Cup No. 1 was again won by Samuel Cody, flying his Circuit of Britain biplane in 5 hr 15 min at Laffan's Plain, also setting a new British duration record. The No. 2 cup was also won by Cody, with a flight made on 11 September 1911 of a circuit starting at Laffan's Plain, Farnborough--Andover--Hendon--Brooklands--Farnborough, taking 3 hr 6 min 30 sec to complete the course. =1912= The rules were redefined for the 1912 competition: the No. 1 cup and cash prize of £5,000 was purely for endurance, all flying to be done between sunrise and sunset.

The route is waymarked in both directions, and was opened in spring 2003. It is named after the writer and diplomat John Buchan (1875-1940), who has many associations with the area. The route mainly follows long-established hill tracks through the Peeblesshire countryside. It has three main ascents and descents which give a total climb of about 800 metres, but this climb is never severe. The walk can be completed in one day by strong walkers, or can conveniently be split. Chambers Terrace in Peebles at the start of the walk A wintry scene on Cademuir Hill Bridge over the River Tweed at Stobo Route The walk starts from the west end of Peebles High Street. Later the walk passes the summit of Cademuir Hill where, on a clear day, there are excellent views. Another viewing point is at the head of Glensax. The walk can be terminated at Stobo which is around the halfway point. From here it is possible to catch a bus back to Peebles. For those wishing a longer walk the path passes Stobo Kirk following the Easton Burn and later crossing it on a bridge. Penvalla hill is on the right. Eventually the highest point of the walk is reached above Stobo Hopehead, surely one of the most remote houses in the Scottish Borders, 6 km (4 miles) up a track from the road. The path then descends to the village of Broughton. The walk finishes at the John Buchan Centre at the south end of the village. A detailed description of the route and a map can be downloaded from the Scottish Borders Council website. Nearby attractions Several places of interest can be easily reached from this walk.

Dock10 offers a number of services including post production and The Studios. Its studio filming facility is the best-known part of the company, often referred to as The Studios. It was built as a major part of MediaCityUK, a development in Salford, Greater Manchester. The move saw a number of major productions leave London for the first time and head north to Manchester. The BBC, ITV and Channel 4 all relocated the filming of various shows to The Studios. This included established British shows, Match of the Day and Countdown. Dock10 also offers other media services, such as post production. Their post- production shows include Match of the Day, Blue Peter and Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?. History BBC One show Pitch Battle was filmed at Dock10 The idea for MediaCityUK began as early as 2004, when the BBC announced they were interested in moving hundreds of jobs away from London to another UK city. The Peel Group were involved from the early stages of this move, which resulted in announcing the construction of a 200-acre development in Salford Quays, Greater Manchester. The BBC and The Peel Group announced in 2007 that the construction would begin on the media-based development. The studio facility is built on the site of the former Manchester Ship Canal docks. Construction of dock10 began in 2007, and it was ready to go on air in January 2011. It was officially opened by Queen Elizabeth II in March 2012. The name \\"dock10\\" is said to come from a site plan drawn over 100 years ago that stated, \\"SITE OF FUTURE DOCK NO. 10\\". At the heart of the MediaCityUK project, was the idea of producing BBC shows outside of London. A studio was then proposed at the site, which was constructed in time for the BBC move in 2011. The new £22 million studio was originally known as MediaCityUK studios, before becoming The Studios. The BBC became the first major tenant of The Studios. The Studios and the media infrastructure was rebranded in 2012 and Dock10 was formed. In 2013, Dock10 signed their first production deal with ITV. The deal was to use dock10 to record and produce a number of ITV Studios shows, and was extended in 2016 to run until 2018. By 2016, Dock10 had grown into a major production provider to British-based TV shows. In March 2016, Dock10 announced that they had acquired Edit 19, a Manchester-based visual effects and editing company. Later that year, they announced that they were expanding their post-production facility, offering many services gained from the acquisition of Edit 19. In May 2017, Dock10 opened a new studio, HQ8, suitable for small sets and green screen productions. This studio was designed to meet the demands from creative agencies and digital content creators wanting to use professional facilities. In November 2017, Dock10 announced that they had secured a contract with BBC Creative. This would mean certain BBC promos and branding work would be produced outside of London. Since the 2018 revival of Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?, the show has been filmed at Dock10. It was previously filmed at Elstree Studios in Hertfordshire. In January 2019, ITV Studios announced plans to remain at Dock10 until at least 2021. The extended contract meant the company's shows would continue to be filmed and produced on site, which included shows such as Judge Rinder and (as of May 2019, cancelled) The Jeremy Kyle Show. The post-production facilities at Dock10 were expanded in 2019 as part of a wider £5 million investment to meet increased demand. The expansion included a new creative production space called The Second Floor, which provides additional space for production companies. The new facilities include fourteen edit suites, audio tracklay, and dubbing suites. In May 2019, Dock10 announced the launch of a new 4K UHD-ready virtual studio capability using Epic Games' Unreal Engine 4. This technology allows programme makers to create photorealistic output in real-time. In August 2019, Dock10 are to host JD Sports inaugural Esports event, JDX, with the semi-finals and finals being hosted at the facility. For the launch of the 2019-20 football season, BBC Sport announced that their football shows Match of the Day and Match of the Day 2 would be broadcast from a virtual reality studio at Dock10. This studio will also be used by other BBC football programmes including Final Score and Football Focus. Channel 4 have commissioned new peak time Christmas-themed four part series Buy it Now, to be hosted by Rylan Clark-Neal. Buy It Now is produced by Studio Lambert North and will be filmed at Dock10. Studio facilities The studios are owned and managed by Dock10. The company has two major divisions: studios, and post-production. The studios feature eight conventional TV studios, two audio studios, two unique spaces used for television production, digital post-production, and cloud media management services. Many major productions such as The Voice UK are filmed in HQ1, which is the UK's biggest multi-camera TV studio that can hold live audiences up to 1,000 people. HQ2, HQ3, and HQ4 are the other three large or medium-sized studios on site, with shows such as Match of the Day, The Voice UK, Football Focus, Countdown, Judge Rinder and University Challenge filmed in the four studios. Shows with a smaller studio requirement, such as Newsround, Blue Peter and Saturday Mash-Up!, use HQ5, HQ6, HQ7 or HQ8. HQ9 and HQ10 are specialist audio studios. The final two studios are large spaces for more open productions. HQ11 is the only outdoor studio on site and with HQ12 is a mezzanine studio, often seen on Watchdog. Dock10 recently invested in Leader LV7600 rasterising SDI/IP test instruments for its 4K/UHD and HDR capable grading and finishing areas. =Studio specifications= BBC Sport set at Dock10 as seen in March 2019 HQ11 outdoor studio (piazza) seen at night HQ1 The largest multi-camera TV studio in Britain, HQ1 is and has an audience capacity of 1,000.

Early life Koltai was born on 31 July 1924, in Berlin, Germany, to a family of Jewish descent. He was the only child of a Hungarian-born doctor Alfred and his wife Charlotte (née Weinstein) Koltai who was German. Their son was on the Kindertransport from Brussels to England in 1939. His parents survived the Holocaust; his mother was able to settle in Britain, while his father began again in Cuba. Koltai worked as a translator at the Nuremberg trials and later for the British Intelligence Corps as an investigator of war crimes. His military service ended in 1948. From 1943, Koltai trained to a commercial artist at Epsom School of Art before he entered the military. From 1948 to 1951, he studied at the Central School of Arts and Crafts (now Central Saint Martins) where he was later the head of theatre design between 1965 and 1972. Career as a set designer Soon after his graduation, his designs for Sadler's Wells Opera, Covent Garden Opera and Ballet Rambert began to gain notice. Koltai was influenced by European theatre practitioners such as Bertolt Brecht and Vsevolod Meyerhold. \\"What I wanted to do was to find a single image which would express what the author was saying, rather than just provide illustrations,\\" he said of his design principles. \\"I wanted to show the idea, the concept.\\" He told critic Michael Billington in 1984 that he attempted to find \\"a style that seeks to find the right metaphor for each work.\\" In 1963, for the RSC at the Aldwych Theatre, London, he set Rolf Hochhuth's The Deputy (also known as The Representative), about Pope Pius XII's connection to the Nazis. He later commented: \\"My concept was to set it in a gas chamber that was also the Pope’s study—it showed that the Vatican and the extermination chambers were part of each other.\\" His first work for the RSC had been the previous year's production of Brecht's The Caucasian Chalk Circle. In 1984, when an RSC production of Rostand's Cyrano de Bergerac was being performed on Broadway, he told critic Michael Billington that he saw himself as a painter who treats the play as an art object. He commented that he did not \\"respond well to being told what is wanted. I like to make a conceptual contribution where you half need to direct the play yourself.\\" In later life he lived in France taking found objects on local farms made of wood, metal and turning them into sculptures. One of these creations, a tree root, was surrounded by water in his stage design for Samuel West's revival of Howard Brenton's The Romans in Britain at the Crucible Theatre, Sheffield, in 2006. In 2010 his metal collage sculptures were exhibited at the Royal National Theatre.

Of his career, he said “Whatever talent I had, it was instinct; I’ve never made a decision. I often arrive at the resolution by accident. The talent that I have is to recognise the accident when it happens.” Honours Koltai was made a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in the 1983 New Year Honours and was recognised as a Royal Designer for Industry (RDI) by the Royal Society of Arts in 1984. He appeared as a \\"castaway\\" on the BBC Radio programme Desert Island Discs on 23 August 1998. Death Koltai died on 15 December 2018 at the age of 94.

It focuses on the conservation work of park rangers within the Congo's Virunga National Park during the rise of the violent M23 Rebellion in 2012 and investigates the activity of the British oil company Soco International within the UNESCO World Heritage site. Soco International ended up officially exploring oil opportunities in Virunga in April 2014. The film premiered at the Tribeca Film Festival on 17 April 2014. After airing on Netflix, it was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature. Synopsis The documentary tells the story of four characters fighting to protect Virunga National Park in the Democratic Republic of Congo, home to the world's last mountain gorillas, from war, poaching, and the threat of oil exploration. Following gorilla caregiver André Bauma, central sector warden Rodrigue Mugaruka Katembo, chief warden Emmanuel de Merode, and the French investigative journalist Mélanie Gouby, the film focuses on the natural beauty and biodiversity of Virunga, as well as the complex political and economic issues surrounding oil exploration and armed conflict in the region. Production Production began in 2012, when von Einsiedel traveled to Virunga National Park in the Democratic Republic of Congo with the intention of documenting the positive progress which had been made by the park authorities in encouraging tourism and development in the region. However, within three weeks of arriving in Virunga, conflict began with the M23 rebellion in April 2012, shifting the focus of the film to cover the emerging conflict. Von Einsiedel collaborated with park officials and French journalist Mélanie Gouby to investigate the role of the British oil company Soco International, which had been undertaking activities in the area. Undercover filming appeared to show Soco representatives offering bribes to park rangers. Soco International has strongly denied the allegations made in the documentary. Release Virunga had its world premiere at the Tribeca Film Festival in New York City on 17 April 2014. The premiere of the film came just two days after Virunga National Park's chief warden, Emmanuel de Merode, was shot by unidentified gunmen on the road from the city of Goma to the park's headquarters in Rumangabo. De Merode survived the attack, and with his encouragement, the premiere of Virunga went ahead. The film has been screened at multiple film festivals around the world, including Canadian festivals Hot Docs and DOXA; Docville in Leuven, Belgium; in the U.S. at Little Rock Film Festival in Arkansas, Mountainfilm in Colorado, AFI Docs in Washington DC, Traverse City Film Festival in Michigan. The UK premiere of the film was at the Edinburgh International Film Festival on 24 June 2014. On 28 July 2014, it was announced that Netflix had picked up exclusive rights to the film. The documentary was released onto the service on 7 November the same year. On June 23, 2020, it was announced that Barry Jenkins would direct the feature film adaptation of the Virunga, and that Leonardo DiCaprio would produce it. Reception =Critical reception= Joanna Natasegara and Orlando von Einsiedel at the 74th Annual Peabody Awards Virunga has received universal acclaim by critics. On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has a 100% rating based on 21 reviews with an average rating of 9.09/10. The site's critical consensus reads \\"Virunga offers a heart-rending glimpse of natural wonders vulnerable to the atrocities of greed -- and the people devoting their lives to defending them\\". Metacritic, another review aggregator, assigned the film a weighted average score of 95 out of 100 based on 5 reviews from mainstream critics, indicating \\"universal acclaim\\". It is currently one of the site's highest-rated films. Jeannette Catsoulis, writing for The New York Times, called the film \\"extraordinary\\", whilst Los Angeles Times film critic Sheri Linden described Virunga as an \\"urgent investigative report and unforgettable drama... a work of heart-wrenching tenderness and heart-stopping suspense\\". Ronnie Scheib wrote for Variety that Virunga was an \\"extraordinary documentary\\" with \\"enough action, pathos, suspense, venal villains, stalwart heroes and endangered gorillas for a dozen fiction films\\". Tom Roston wrote for PBS's POV blog that \\"Virunga is the best documentary I've seen this year.\\" =Awards= Virunga has won several awards including the Peabody Award; the Feature Documentary Award at DOXA Documentary Festival in Vancouver, Canada; the Award of International Emerging Filmmaker at Hot Docs in Toronto; the Golden Rock Documentary Award at Little Rock Film Festival; and the Action and Change Together (ACT Now) Award at the Crested Butte Film Festival. It won two gongs at the One World Media Awards at BAFTA - Best Documentary, and the Corruption Reporting award. The film was also nominated for Best Documentary Feature at Tribeca Film Festival. The film was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature for the 87th Academy Awards. Impact The allegations brought against Soco International by the documentary, and supported by local NGOs and civil society organizations working in and around Virunga National park, put increased pressure on the company to put an end to its exploration for oil within the protected World Heritage Site. On 11 June 2014, Soco International and the WWF announced a joint statement in which the oil company committed \\"not to undertake or commission any exploratory or other drilling within Virunga National Park unless UNESCO and the DRC government agree that such activities are not incompatible with its World Heritage status\\". This was widely cited as a victory for WWF, which had long been campaigning for Soco to leave the region, and credit was also given to the filmmakers. However, strong concerns about the credibility of this agreement were raised by the filmmakers, alongside other NGOs such as Global Witnessㄝ Human Rights Watch, and local civil society organisations. World Wildlife Fund executives now acknowledge that the battle over Virunga is hardly over. Soco has yet to relinquish its operating permits or commit to an unconditional withdrawal. \\"They're leaving the door open,\\" said Zach Abraham, director of the World Wildlife Fund's global campaigns. On 13 March 2015, BBC reported that the Democratic Republic of Congo says it could potentially redraw the boundaries of Virunga National Park, to allow for oil exploration. On 4 November 2015, Soco said it no longer held a stake in the exploration licence for the DRC national park.

The film was released on September 2, 2016, by Invincible Pictures. Plot Colleen Collette and Colleen McKenzie are two average 15-year-old girls that spend their days studying yoga with their guru, Yogi Bayer, and working an after-school job at a Manitoba convenience store called Eh-2-Zed. They are also in a cover band called Glamthrax with their 35-year-old friend, Ichabod, on drums. The two are invited to a party by a popular senior, Hunter Calloway, who is the object of Colleen M's affections. The next day at school, the girls' history teacher informs the class that the Nazi Party once had an influence in Winnipeg. Led by the self-proclaimed \\"Canadian Führer\\" Adrien Arcand and his right-hand-man, Andronicus Arcane, the Canadian Nazis were once a great force of terror. Arcand was later arrested by Federal authorities, but Andronicus Arcane was never found. Colleen C's father Bob, who owns the Eh-2-Zed, and his girlfriend Tabitha, the store's manager, decide to take a spontaneous trip to Niagara Falls, leaving the girls to run the store on the night of Hunter's party. The Colleens invite Hunter and his friend Gordon Greenleaf to bring the party to the store so that they would not miss out. Colleen M escorts Hunter to the back room at his request, only to discover that Hunter and Gordon are actually Satanists who wish to sacrifice and dismember the Colleens. Before this can occur, an army of little monsters called Bratzis (one-foot-tall Nazis made from bratwurst) attack and kill Hunter and Gordon. Using their yoga skills, the Colleens fight and defeat the Bratzis, but are soon arrested for the murder of Hunter and Gordon. Legendary man-hunter Guy LaPointe, who had an encounter with the Colleens once before, arrives at the police station to interrogate the girls. Having obtained some of his own evidence of the Bratzis, he believes the girls' testimony and wishes to help them prove their innocence. After sneaking them out of the station and taking them back to the Eh-2-Zed, LaPointe and the Colleens are knocked unconscious by the Bratzis. They are taken to an underground lair beneath the store where they find the Bratzis' master, Andronicus Arcane. Arcane reveals to LaPointe and the Colleens that he once had dreams of becoming an artist. After having his work ridiculed by various critics, he decided to become a scientist for the Canadian Nazi movement. The Nazis hid him in the underground lair to create a clone army to conquer Canada and the United States. The clones, made from bratwurst and Arcane's DNA, needed to incubate for 100 years before they were fully grown, so Arcane cryogenically froze himself until the time when he and his clones could rise again. This process was interrupted when a power outage at the Eh-2-Zed 70 years later caused Arcane to thaw and the clones' incubation to stop, rendering them just one foot in height. Learning that the Nazi Party had long since been defeated, Arcane began a new mission to kill all critics as revenge for those that poorly reviewed his early work. He reveals he has constructed a ten-foot-tall goaltender from body parts of the Bratzis' victims to carry out his murderous deeds. This \\"Goalie Golem\\" is controlled by the Bratzis who operate it from its insides. No longer wishing to follow Arcane's orders, the Golem kills him and then turns on the Colleens. The Colleens once again use their yoga skills to defeat the Golem and soon after, clear their names. After being dubbed \\"Hero Clerks\\" by the media, the Colleens return to their normal lives and end the film with a cover of \\"O, Canada\\", accompanied on guitar by Guy LaPointe.

The title came from a remark Scott Mosier made during an early 2014 segment of SModcast, the podcast he cohosts with Smith. Smith brought up fanciful quotes attributed to Simon Metke, an Edmonton yoga instructor whose home had recently been raided by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP), who recovered an artwork stolen from the Montreal Museum of Fine Arts in 2011 there. Mosier imagined the RCMP saying \\"Open up, yoga hoser!\\" as they knocked on the door. After it became a catchphrase among the podcast's listeners, Smith announced it would be the title of his next film. The character of Yogi Bayer in the film is also based on descriptions of Metke in the media. In August 2014, it was revealed Yoga Hosers would be an action-adventure, and the second in the True North trilogy. The film includes the entire cast of Tusk, including Depp's daughter Lily-Rose and Smith's daughter Harley Quinn, starring in their reprised roles as clerks. Tony Hale, Natasha Lyonne, Austin Butler, Adam Brody, Tyler Posey, and Jason Mewes also appear. StarStream Entertainment helped finance and produce the film, while XYZ Films co-produced. In September 2014, it was revealed Haley Joel Osment and Genesis Rodriguez had joined the cast as well, and it was later revealed Kevin Smith would portray a bratzi. Comic book writer Stan Lee had a cameo appearance, his second in a Smith film, after 1995's Mallrats. Thomas Ashley put up 25% of the equity to create the film and was an executive producer. =Filming= Smith announced on August 20, 2014, that filming had begun, and on September 18, 2014, he stated on SModcast #308 that he had wrapped three quarters of the film, and would finish the last quarter once Depp is available. Principal photography concluded in January 2015. Release The film had its world premiere at the 2016 Sundance Film Festival on January 24. A tie-in comic book was also given out exclusively at the Sundance premiere. Written by Kevin Smith and illustrated by Jeff Quigley, Yoga Hosers: When Colleens Collide tells the story of how the girls met and became friends. Later in 2017, Dynamite Entertainment reprinted this special issue for release to comic stores.Dynamite Entertainment page for both releases of WHEN COLLEENS COLLIDE In April 2016, Invincible Pictures acquired US distribution rights to the film, and initially planned a July 29, 2016, release. The film was later pushed back to September 2.  Reception  Yoga Hosers was panned by critics and audiences, who considered it a low point in Smith's film career. On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has a rating of 23%, based on 60 reviews, with an average rating of 3.52/10. The site's critical consensus reads, \\"Undisciplined, unfunny, and bereft of evident purpose, Yoga Hosers represents a particularly grating low point in Kevin Smith's once-promising career.\\" On Metacritic, the film holds a rating of 23 out of 100, based on 17 critics, indicating \\"generally unfavorable reviews.\\" Justin Chang of Variety disliked the film, writing that \\"Harley Quinn Smith and especially Lily-Rose Depp have sufficient spunk, spark and chemistry (and they're charming bopping through an end- credits cover of \\"O Canada\\") that you long to see them in a starring vehicle that doesn't look and feel like an on-screen underwear stain. Shot and edited with the sort of willful slovenliness that presumably fits the anything-goes grab-bag effect Smith was going for, Yoga Hosers looks as though it was probably pretty fun to make, though only the director's hardcore fans and SModcast listeners are likely to find that pleasure in any way infectious.\\" John DeFore of The Hollywood Reporter also gave the film a negative review, writing that \\"the young leads seem to be having fun even if you aren't, but any acting careers they might go on to will not be the result of this film.\\" Korey Coleman, of DoubleToasted.com, expressed strong criticism for the film, stating that it was the worst movie he had seen in years. He also felt Smith's privilege in obtaining funding for the film was an insult to aspiring filmmakers who struggle to even get a foot in the door of the industry. He placed it at the #1 spot for the worst movie of 2016, tying with Fifty Shades of Black. In an extended review for The A.V. Club in 2017, Nathan Rabin summed up the film as a \\"fiasco,\\" blaming \\"self-indulgence\\" and \\"laziness\\" leading to \\"Smith combin[ing] what are clearly his two great loves in life: family and making terrible comedies. It's a beautiful thing when a man is able to fuse his personal and professional life this way. It's just a shame the result is borderline unwatchable.\\" Spin-off Kevin Smith has said that his True North trilogy will conclude with a film titled Moose Jaws, which he describes as \\"Jaws with a moose.\\" Smith revealed that the Colleens will return for Moose Jaws.

In 1862 he had bought Queen, a magazine for women which had popular 'Exchange and Mart' columns allowing readers to buy and sell products. In May 1868 a weekly paper, Exchange & Mart, was founded by Cox in a converted potato warehouse in Covent Garden. It was the first in the world to specialise in classified advertising. In 1926 Exchange and Mart was taken over by Bazaar Exchange & Mart Ltd. By 1999 Exchange and Mart was owned by CMP Media, which was acquired by United News & Media (later UBM) for $920 million. In 2005, Newsquest's Exchange Enterprises division acquired Exchange & Mart and Auto Exchange from United Advertising Publications'. Exchange and Mart ceased publishing as a magazine in 2009 but continues online only. Printed magazine The Exchange and Mart magazine was published weekly from 1868 to 2009. During World War II, the magazine was slimmed down by paper rationing and by 1948 it was still suffering under rationing, with a circulation of 70,000. At its peak, it reached an audited circulation of over 350,000, making Exchange & Mart a household name. A 1998 study described Exchange and Mart as a \\"well known and established paper\\", also \\"hard edged, no nonsense\\" and popular for selling vehicles, a forerunner to more modern publications such as Loot. However, in 2009 and with its final ABC Circulation figures (December 2007) at 21,754 Exchange and Mart focused on becoming an online only business and ceased publishing the printed magazine.

These functions are host defense (classically activated macrophages), wound healing (alternatively activated/wound-healing macrophages) and immune regulation (Mregs). Physiological role of Mregs is to dampen the immune response and limit immunopathology. Unlike classically activated macrophages, Mregs produce high levels of anti-inflammatory cytokine interleukin 10 (IL-10) and turn off IL-12 synthesis. And unlike wound-healing macrophages, Mregs do not induct arginase, so they do not contribute to the production of the extracellular matrix. Mreg origin Mregs can arise following innate or adaptive immune responses. Mreg population was firstly described after FcγR ligation by IgG complexes in occurrence of pathogen-associated molecular patterns (e. g. lipopolysaccharide or lipoteichoic acid) acting through Toll-like receptors. This stimulation specifically decreased IL-12 production and increased IL-10 production. Coculture of macrophages with regulatory T cells (Tregs) caused differentiation of macrophages toward Mreg phenotype. Similar effect provoked interaction of macrophages and B-1 B cells. Mregs can even arise following stress responses. Activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis leads to production of glucocorticoids that cause decreased production of IL-12 by macrophages. Mechanism and regulation of IL-10 production There are many different ways to prepare or generate Mregs, but there is necessary a combination of two stimuli to Mreg phenotypical switch and to appear sufficient production of high levels of IL-10. Nevertheless, a molecule mechanism that mediates their phenotypical change has not been identified yet. As a potential candidate it seems to be the extracellular signal regulated kinase (ERK, one of MAPK). Its activation combined with FcγR ligation mediates chromatin remodeling at the il-10 locus, to make the promoter more accessible to transcription factors. Biochemical and functional characterization of Mregs Surprisingly, Mregs resemble classically activated macrophages more than alternatively activated macrophages. It means that biochemical differences between Mregs and classically activated macrophages are more subtle. Mregs produce high level of Il-10 and low levels of IL-12. They produce high levels of nitric oxide, but they almost do not have any arginase activity, so they can not produce urea. Mregs express high levels of co- stimulatory molecules (CD86) and MHC Class II, they have the highest expression of these molecule in comparison with the other population of macrophages. T cells co-culture with Mregs showed intense activation and proliferation, so Mregs act as sufficient antigen-presenting cells. Nevertheless, in the secondary response these T cells produced high levels of IL-10. Mregs express two markers that might be used to identify Mregs in mouse, they are sphingosine kinase-1 (SPHK1) and LIGHT (TNF superfamily 14).

St Saviourgate is a historic street in the city of York. History The area in which the street runs just outside the city walls of Roman Eboracum, north of a marshy area around the River Foss. When the foundations of new houses were dug here in the seventeenth century, large numbers of animal horns were found, indicating the site of a Roman temple, next to the palace. The street was first mentioned in 1175, when it was known as \\"Ketmongergate\\", street of the flesh sellers. St Saviour's Church was built on the street in the 11th- century, and by 1368, it had given its name to the street. The street became a centre for nonconformism in the city. The York Unitarian Chapel was built in 1693, the Congregationalist Salem Chapel was built in 1839, and the Methodist Centenary Chapel in 1840. Much of the rest of the street was rebuilt in the 18th-century, and in 1736, it was described by Francis Drake as \\"one of the neatest and best-built streets in the city\\". The street was widened in 1777. In the 1960, the Salem Chapel was demolished to make way for an office block. Architecture and layout The street runs from the junction of Colliergate and Whip-Ma-Whop-Ma-Gate, north-east to the junction of Spen Lane and St Saviour's Place. Historically, St Saviour's Place was regarded as part of the street, while, Hungate led off the south side of the street, but following the construction of Stonebow, the Stonebow House office block was built and blocked the route. Notable buildings on the north-west side of the street include the Methodist Church, a masonic hall which was originally built as the city' Mechanic's Institute, 18th-century houses at 27, 29 and 31, 33 and 35, and an early Victorian range at 1-7 which was formerly a department store. On the south-east side of the street lie the rear of Stonebow House, described by Nickolaus Pevsner as \\"disastrous\\", St Saviour's Church, now housing the Jorvik DIG centre, the terrace of 16-22 St Saviourgate, built in 1740, other 18th- century houses at 24, 26, 30 and 32, and 34 St Saviourgate, with 15th-century origins.

Dot Chinese Website is among one of many listed top level domains. Created along with the partner domain name Dot Chinese Online (.在线) by TLD Registry through Internet Corporation for Assigned Numbers and Names (ICANN)’s new gTLD program launched in April 28, 2014. TLD Registry was founded in June 2008 in Finland with the mission to create essential new Chinese TLDs - intended mainly towards a Chinese-speaking audience. Because it is displayed in a simplified Chinese character language specific script, Dot Chinese Website is known as an Internationalized Domain Name (IDNs). The Chinese used for the domain Dot Chinese Website, \\"中文网\\", directly translates to \\"Chinese Language Website\\". For Chinese speaking internet users, this communicates a standard phrase they use to find an international website localized into Chinese. Dot Chinese Website is deemed as a premium domain name, and TLD Registry has sold over $900,000 in premium domain names. It holds the record for the most successful premium domain name auction in the ICANN New gTLD Program. The auction was held in the prestigious private members club of the Galaxy Macau, CHINA ROUGE. Hundreds of popular brands and corporations such as Nokia, MSN, Reuters, Jay Chou, the NBA, Eminem, CNBC， IMDb, Real Madrid, Samsung, the United Nations, the BBC and various others are using the term 中文网 in their names. TLD Registry has 52 different accredited partner registrars currently serving the domain name Dot Chinese Website. Dot Chinese Website (.中文网) along with Dot Chinese Online (.在线) currently hold the highest volume in the world in new IDN gTLD registrations. Retrieved 20 October 2016 A feature case study was carried out about the two Chinese IDNs in Section 8.2.5 of the report (page 86). In the Domain Name Association's (DNA) first official newsletter the State of the Domains\\", Dot Chinese Online (.在线) and Dot Chinese Website (.中文网) were featured in the \\"IDN Spotlight\\" portion. Released in October 2014, at ICANN 51 in Los Angeles, the \\"State of the Domains\\" is a comprehensive quarterly report that provides analysis, trends, and case studies of current Internet domains. TLD Registry, is responsible for the design of the newsletter and completed the full-Mandarin edition of the newsletter. Dot Chinese Website (.CN) is the second most registered top-level-domain TLD after .COM. As of Q4 2017 there are 21.4M .CN registrations. Registration history The application for Dot Chinese Website domain was submitted to ICANN on April 12, 2013. Finnish Prime Minister Jyrki Katainen, attended the ICANN signing ceremony of the Formal Registry Agreement (RA) contract in Beijing on September 10, 2013. On December 3, 2013 in Helsinki, Finland, TLD Registry Ltd, a domain name registry dedicated to Chinese IDNs, announced the launch schedule for two of its domains: Dot Chinese Online and Dot Chinese Website. According to ICANN regulation and rules, the Dot Chinese Online (.在线) and Dot Chinese Website (.中文网) were introduced to the global internet. On November 28, Dot Chinese Online and Dot Chinese Website passed ICANN pre-delegation testing, to test for technical integrity. For 60 days, beginning on January 17 - March 17, Dot Chinese Online and Dot Chinese Website went through the trademark-owners only Sunrise period. The second stage, \\"the Landrush period\\" occurred on March 20. Dot Chinese Online and Dot Chinese Website were auctioned off at the Galaxy Macau on Friday, March 21. The Landrush period went on through the weeklong ICANN conference in Singapore (March 23–27) and China's Qing Ming festival (April 4–6), and concluded on Thursday, April 24. A three-day quiet period immediately followed. General availability of domain names Dot Chinese Online and Dot Chinese Website began on Monday April 28, 2014. The Landrush event incited the Chinese government, which purchased close to 20,000 IDNs. The Chinese government also announced that the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology of the People's Republic of China (MIIT) has made it mandatory for all Chinese government-run websites to make the change to exclusively Chinese-specific domain names. Security It is difficult for Chinese netizens to identify phishing attacks in a complete English URL due to language barriers. Therefore, Chinese IDNs provide a source of protection for Chinese consumers against phishing attacks. Chinese netizens (and the Chinese government) tend to favor fully Chinese web addresses because they are more easily able to spot phishing URLs in their own language.

It was available for iOS and Android and it allowed people to create and view discussion threads within a radius (termed \\"Yaks\\" by the application). It was similar to other anonymous sharing apps such as Nearby, but differed from others such as Whisper in that it was intended for sharing primarily with those in proximity to the user. All users had the ability to contribute to the stream by writing, responding, and \\"voting up\\" or \\"voting down\\" (liking or disliking) yaks. Despite strong levels of growth in 2013 and 2014, following several bouts of heavy criticism in the media over the facilitation of cyber-bullying, the service saw massive stagnation in the growth of its user base. In 2016 alone, user downloads fell 76% compared to 2015. Failing to maintain user engagement, Yik Yak announced on April 28, 2017 that the service would close in the coming week. For $1 million, Square purchased Yik Yak's intellectual property and hired several of its former employees. History The co-founders, Tyler Droll and Brooks Buffington, are both graduates from Furman University in Greenville, South Carolina. The two started collaborating when they were placed into the same class where they learned how to code iPhone apps. After graduating from Furman University, they decided to go full-time with their project. Droll dropped out of medical school just before it started and Buffington put his finance career on hold. The two, together with Will Jamieson, released the app in November 2013, and twelve months later, Yik Yak was ranked as the ninth most downloaded social media app in the United States. Improvements on the Yik Yak app continued throughout 2015, including measures to ensure its sustainability. The last major change was the announcement on January 20, 2016 that a web version of the app was available. Attempts were made in 2015 to reduce its use for cyber- bullying, such as the new mandatory use of handles (later reverted to an optional feature) and removal of the \\"My Herd\\" feature (also was later reverted). On April 28, 2017, Yik Yak announced it would be shutting down. This followed months of rumors among the app's users about a potential shutdown. The declining popularity of the app had become very noticeable, and the app ceased to function as of May 5, 2017.  Funding  Yik Yak was originally funded by Atlanta Ventures with offices based in the Atlanta Tech Village. On April 22, 2014, the company announced that it had secured $1.5 million in funding from various companies such as Vaizra Investments, DCM, Kevin Colleran, and Azure Capital Partners. This funding came five months after Yik Yak was founded, and was intended both to enhance the app, and to market the app both in the United States and overseas. On June 30, 2014, a little over two months after the initial $1.5 million, Yik Yak secured $10 million more from its previous investors, together with new investors Renren Lianhe Holdings and Tim Draper. During the fall of 2014, with exponential user growth, Yik Yak secured over $60 million from Sequoia Capital and other investors. Less than one year after its launch, Yik Yak then had a valuation of over $350 million. On May 5, 2017, the application servers and website went offline, and the application became defunct. Features * Yakarma: Yakarma was a numerical score generated by the software that aimed to measure the active success of a user. The number increased and decreased based upon the responses to their yaks by other proximate users. Yakarma changed depending on the number of downvotes or upvotes, replies, and comments that were made on a user's post. Receiving downvotes negatively affected a user's Yakarma, while upvotes increased it. The exact effect on yakarma was determined by the status (yakarma) of the voting user. * Reply Icons: User anonymity was designed into Yik Yak conversations by assigning the Original Poster an OP icon, and repliers were randomly generated one of a standard 20 icons including: socks, hot air balloon, anchor, lantern, compass, canoe, binoculars, boot, sailboat, campfire, hook, mushroom, teepee, flashlight, paddles (or oars), acorn, pith helmet, bear print, shovel, and map. The icon was pegged to a user only for a particular thread, and for the duration of that conversation the reply icon was also customized with a colorful background circle. Each reply icon could be backed by any of the color circles, which added to the randomness of the anonymity for each user in every conversation. It was common for one user to address another user by the color and the symbol of the icon, e.g. Good point Blue Compass! or... What do you think about that Red Teepee? Occasionally, the standard set of icons was substituted with seasonal holiday icons e.g. for Halloween, or a winter theme with simple line drawings that referenced Christmas and Hanukkah. * Upvote/Downvote: Up and down votes were essentially user ratings on a given yak. For a post to become popular it had to receive more upvotes than downvotes, at which time it displayed a positive number next to it. If votes on a post reached a value of -5, it was permanently deleted. * Peek: The \\"peek\\" feature allowed users to anonymously view other Yik Yak community feeds. Initially, the only other areas users could “Peek” into were US and International colleges. With the October 20, 2014 app update, users were able to Peek into any college or city in the world. When users viewed other Yik Yak feeds, they could see other user's posts but could not vote or post into that community. Users could only post in their local Yik Yak community. * Other Top Yaks: This simply showed the google image result page from searching the word \\"yak\\". Usually just pictures of yaks (the animal). * Photos: This feature allowed users to include pictures in their yaks. The company indicated that uploaded photos were moderated and that no inappropriate content, illegal content, or faces were allowed in local feeds. More specifically, photo collections displayed a grid of popular photographs submitted from anyone in the specified location. * Hidden Features: Yik Yak also contained a word filter. When a post contained threatening or offensive language, the app would remind the user that their post could be offensive, and asked them if they still wished to post it. If the user bypassed the warning, the post would then be flagged and subject to removal by moderators. Posts that contained phone numbers could not be posted. Dissolution One of the biggest criticisms of social media sites and applications is their inherent potential to feed the growing amount of cyberbullying. Due to the widespread bullying and harassment committed through Yik Yak, many schools and school districts took action to ban the app. These included several Chicago school districts, Norwich University in Vermont, Eanes Independent School District in Texas, Lincoln High School district in Rhode Island, New Richmond School District in Ohio, Shawnigan Lake School in Canada and Pueblo County School District in Colorado. Tatum High School in New Mexico banned cell phone use from the school due to Yik Yak, and the Student Government Association at Emory University in Georgia attempted to ban the app across campus, but failed to do so after immense backlash from students. On May 13, 2015, Santa Clara University President Michael Engh released a statement to all students after several racist remarks were posted on Yik Yak. He wrote, “Hate speech, not to be confused with free speech, has no place at Santa Clara University, because it violates the dignity and respect with which each member of our community is entitled to be treated. Hurtful comments directed at individuals or groups diminish us all and create a divisive atmosphere of distrust and suspicion.” On October 3, 2014, The Huffington Post published an editorial by Ryan Chapin Mach titled \\"Why Your College Campus Should Ban Yik Yak,\\" which asserted that Yik Yak's anonymous messaging boards \\"are like bathroom stalls without toilets. They're useless, they're sources of unhelpful or harmful conversations, and they're a complete eyesore.\\" To remedy the cases of bullying in middle and high schools around the country, Droll and Buffington amended the application to include geofences that work in the background. These unseen fences disable the application within their defined borders. At first these boundaries were installed manually by the developers, but it quickly became clear they would need outside assistance. They found this assistance in a Vermont-based company known as Maponics. Maponics “builds and defines geographic boundaries.” They happened to already have nearly 85% of the country's high schools mapped, making it easy to block access to Yik Yak in those areas. The fences disabled the app on all middle and high school grounds throughout the country. If the app is opened within one of these areas the user is displayed a message along the lines of: “it looks like you’re trying to use Yik Yak on a middle school or high school grounds. Yik Yak is intended for people college-aged and above. The app is disabled in this area.” The frequency of bullying and harassment that happened on Yik Yak might have been exaggerated by media stories citing specific incidents. Researchers have identified how Yik Yak is mostly used as a positive way to explore racial, ethnic, and sexual identities and to build a sense of community on campus. Others have identified how Yik Yak gives marginalized students a voice on campus. In 2015, Yik Yak gained attention by being the subject of preventing a suicide attempt at the College of William and Mary. In December 2014, security researchers discovered and demonstrated a potential attack on the service, where a Yik Yak user could have their account compromised and be deanonymised (having their identity revealed) if an attacker was using the same WiFi network. In February 2015, Yik Yak was exposed for systematically downvoting and deleting posts that mention competitors. The automatic system downvoted and deleted any posts that contained words that associated with names of other apps used by university students, including \\"fade,\\" \\"unseen,\\" \\"erodr,\\" and \\"sneek.\\" The downvoting algorithm, which assigned downvotes on regular intervals until the posts were deleted, appeared to be designed to mislead users to thinking that their posts were unpopular amongst peers, rather than censored by Yik Yak itself. In December 2015, the SLOG and the Seattle Times reported that a Western Washington University student had been arrested and released on bail after calling for the lynching of the student body president of the university. The racist threats were posted on Yik Yak. During 2016, use of Yik Yak declined severely, by 76% over 2015. This limited its former projected growth potential, and in December 2016, Yik Yak laid off 60 percent of its workers. Based on a report by The Verge, the community, marketing, design, and product teams were all deeply affected. In addition to the aforementioned manipulation of content by corporate, the presence of extensive cyberbullying on the site was a primary cause of this decline in usage. However, TechCrunch pointed out that \\"any forum offering users anonymity and a means of chatting\\" would have the potential to be \\"plagued by cyberbullies.\\" In April 2017, the company announced its closure. The mobile payment operator Square Inc purchased what remained of the organisation for $1m and stripped the company of its assets and integrated Yik Yak's engineers into their operations.

Credited with revamping London department store Selfridges, 150-year-old Italian department store la Rinascente and Berlin's Kaufhaus des Westens.  Early life  The son of a furniture retailer, Vittorio surprised himself and his family by studying agriculture at Milan University before doing his military service. After leaving the army he joined Associated Merchandising Corporation, then one of the largest global buying organisations for Department Stores. By the age of thirty he was responsible for developing ranges and sourcing furniture and home furnishings in more than twenty countries.  Early business career and Habitat UK  In 1990, he joined Habitat International as buying director, when it was part of the Storehouse group, to set up a central purchasing operation. He was appointed managing director of Habitat UK in 1992, shortly before the company was sold to IKEA, and set about the transformation of an ailing business with losses of £7 million into a company twice the size and profits of over £12 million.  Selfridges  He continued to build on success at Habitat until he was headhunted to join Selfridges as managing director in 1996. In this role he has transformed what was a \\"comfy old cardigan\\" of a store into the \\"big sexy giant\\" that is now Selfridges. In 1998 Vittorio led the successful de-merger of Selfridges from the Sears conglomerate. On the back of continuous increase in sales and profit, the Selfridges market value doubled in 4 years. The company was taken private again in July 2003.  Rinascente and Central Group  In 2003 Vittorio was headhunted by Marks & Spencer to set up a new chain of stores dedicated to home furnishings. The first store called Lifestore opened in Newcastle in February 2004. Upon the opening of the first pilot home store Vittorio's role was extended. He was given responsibility for all areas of merchandising, excluding food, including store design & development. However this new role was short lived. In spring 2004 a new Chairman and Chief Executive were appointed, and new strategies were announced. As a consequence Vittorio left the company in June 2004. In early 2005, following the acquisition of la Rinascente by a consortium of private equity and real estate funds, he was appointed chief executive of the Rinascente Department Store business. After a successful program of remodeling and re-positioning of the business, in 2011 Rinascente was sold to Central Retail Corporation of Thailand, with Vittorio remaining at the helm as CEO. In May 2012 he assumed the role of vice chairman in charge of international development. In 2013 Rinascente acquired Danish department store Illum, kick-starting a long-term ambition of building a collection of European historic department stores under the CRC I Rinascente umbrella. This project found further ground early in 2015 with the acquisition of the iconic German Kadewe Group. Vittorio is now fully immersed in the transformation of the newly acquired stores.

He was active before and during the French Revolution and the First French Empire, and made many medals for Napoleon. Life 1803 medal of Napoleon Romain-Vincent Jeuffroy was born on 16 July 1749 in Rouen. He learned his art without a master, imitating an engraved stone that had come into his hands. He made his own tools. He became known, and was sponsored to go to Rome to perfect his art. In 1770 Jeuffroy went to Rome and then to Naples, where he lived for ten years. He worked with Johannes Pichler. He produced many engraved or embossed works, including much work for the French ambassador, the Marquis Jean-Baptiste-Charles-François de Clermont-d'Amboise. After returning to France he made Paris his home. After Jacques Guay (1715–1787) stopped working, Charles-Claude Flahaut de la Billaderie (1730–1809) tried to revive gemstone engraving. He promised to give the work to Jeuffroy, but did not keep his engagement. Jeuffroy engraved several portraits, which made his reputation. In 1790 he accepted an offer from King Stanislaus II of Poland and moved to Warsaw. Jeuffroy returned to Paris and was appointed a member of the Institut de France in 1803. He created a commemorative medal for Napoleon entitled \\"The Treaty of Amiens Broken by England, May 1803\\". Jeuffroy was made a Knight of the Legion of Honour. In 1805 Napoleon founded a school of gemstone engraving, headed by Jeuffroy. The school was established in the deaf-mute institution. In 1816 Jeuffroy was made a member of the Académie des Beaux-Arts in the engraving section. Jeuffroy died on 2 August 1826 in Bas-Prunay near Saint-Germain-en-Laye at the age of 77.

Family Akile Hatun was the daughter of Şeyhülislam Hocazade Esad Efendi (1570 – 1625), member of one of the most venerated ulema lineages in Ottoman history. Her mother was the daughter of Bostanzâde Mehmed Efendi (died 1598), who had served as the chief mufti under Sultan Murad III, and his son Sultan Mehmed III. She had three brothers named Ebusaid Mehmed Efendi (1593-94 – 1662), who also served as a Şeyhülislam, Arif Mehmed Efendi (died 1622), and Ebussuud Efendi (died 1682). She was the granddaughter of esteemed Hoca Sadeddin Efendi (1536-37 – 1599), royal tutor, müfti, historian and founder of a veritable dynasty of prominent religious officials (two of his four sons and three of his grandsons held the post of müfti, while his other two sons held the post of chief justice). Marriage From the time the Ottomans endeavored to transform themselves from an outstanding family of ghazis, whose status vis-à-vis other prominent ghazi families was that of primus inter pares, into a ruling dynasty from which sovereignty emanated, one of the most fundamental notions that guided this ruling house was the prerequisite of avoiding consequential ties with the free aristocracy within the society. However, in 1622, Osman considered marrying Akile. At first, Esad Efendi refused the sultan’s intention to marry his daughter, because such a marriage would constitute a serious break in the Ottoman dynastic tradition. The bailo Giustinian noted that Osman was considered to be capricious and immature in the eyes of his people and that he acted without first consulting his advisors. Moreover, according to the bailo, the marriage was seen as a new practice that could harm the well-being of the empire. Meanwhile, the government viziers were concerned in that the sultan’s marriage to the daughter of the mufti could disrupt the delicate balance of power in the imperial court for it would enable Esad Efendi to exert more influence over the sultan, thus emergence of an alternative focus of power among them. In the end, despite his initial refusal, Esad Efendi complied with the sultan’s demand to marry his daughter. As the wedding dowry, Osman gave 600,000 gold coins to his new father-in-law. The marriage was celebrated in the Old Palace with fireworks in March 1622, only a few months before Osman's death. Acting as the sultan's proxy in the marriage was the prominent Jelveti sheikh Üsküdari Mahmud, among whose followers figured Esad Efendi. The Venetian bailo commented on the marriage by saying that Esad Efendi had accepted it simply to dissuade Osman from undertaking the Pilgrimage. Nevizade Atai, compiler of a seventeenth century ulema biography, described Esad Efendi as \\"a second Edebali\\" because he was honored by the tie of marriage to the dynasty and foremost among the ulema. By the marriage of Akile to Osman her father's relations with the sultan cooled, in part at least because of the marriage. Her marriage with Osman was a sharp break with the dynasty's tradition of avoiding legal alliances, especially with high born Muslim women and it contributed to the popular discontent that culminated in his deposition. The sight of Akile, a free born Muslim of exceptional pedigree, passing through the Babüssaade and into the harem must have seemed an inconceivable nightmare to an Ottoman. However, privy purse accounts suggest that Akile never entered the harem of the imperial palace. Certainly this free born Muslim woman of great status would have been an anomaly in a household composed of slaves, and her presence disruptive of the harem's established hierarchies. As with the projected marriage of Osman's father Ahmed I to a daughter of Kuyucu Murad Pasha, an incident related by the Venetian ambassador Simon Contarini in his 1612 report, suggests that the prospect of the daughter residing within the imperial harem may have been an important element in the unpopularity of the marriage. After Osman's death in May 1622, she married Ganizade Nadiri Efendi (died 1627) a famous Ottoman scholar, poet and calligrapher. In popular culture In 2015 Turkish historical non-fiction TV series Muhteşem Yüzyıl: Kösem, Akile Hatun is portrayed by Turkish actress Bahar Selvi.

The railway line begins at Ragama junction and runs through the major towns along the north-west coast of the country, through to Periyanagavillu. It has forty two stations along its length.  Route definition  Puttalam line starts at Ragama station Puttalam station The line starts from Ragama and runs through the towns of Kandana, Ja- Ela, Seeduwa, Katunayake, Negombo City, Lunuwila, Naththandiya, Madampe, Chilaw, Bangadeniya, Mundel and ends at Puttalam. The passenger trains by Sri Lanka Railways are operated up to Noor Nagar station beyond the Puttalam station and railway section beyond Noor Nagar station is used by Holcim Sri Lanka Limited for the transportation of raw materials from quarry to the factory at Puttalam. This line is also used for the transportation of oil by trains to the Colombo International Airport. History Construction of the rail line to Puttalam commenced on 3 July 1907, with the laying of a railway line from Ragama to Ja-Ela. The project was initiated by Sir Henry Arthur Blake, Governor of Ceylon. The first passenger operations commenced on 9 November 1908. The Negombo railway station was opened on 1 December 1909, with the line extended to Chilaw in 1916. In November 1920 work commenced on the extension to Puttalam, which was officially opened on 12 May 1926. In 1943 the track from Bangadeniya to Puttalam was removed, as the rails were required on other strategically important routes due to shortages caused by World War II. It was re-laid in 1946 with a number of new stations added to the line. The line was also extended beyond Puttalam to Periyanagavillu, where the route forked, with one line running to Aruwakkalu and the other to Illuwankulam. In 2011 a dual track between Ragama and Ja-Ela was officially opened. In 2017 the government commenced investigating the feasibility of extending the rail line from Puttalam via Norocholai power station (servicing the country's main coal power plant) to Mahawa, connecting the Northern and Puttalam lines. Operations This line is served by passenger and freight trains operated by Sri Lanka Railways. The rail line beyond Noor Nagar is used specially for the use of the cement factory.

The game is set with each player starting off controlling a small village, with the objective being to slowly expand and conquer new villages through the formation of complex armies and a tactical combat system. The game incorporates multiple components of teamwork, planning, and strategy. The game allows players to collect resources, build armies, construct buildings, combat other armies (players or neutral), and conquer new villages. The game also allows for a level of player-specific customization, in regards to village names, army types, and troop-counts. The game operates under world-specific settings that vary from world to world. History Tribal Wars, or Die Stämme as it is known in German, is a browser- based game and was released in 2003 as a text-based game. It was developed and released by the German company InnoGames. The game was originally developed by brothers, Eike Klindworth and Hendrik Klindworth, and their friend, Michael Zillmer, before it expanded steadily over the years. The international version of the game was released in 2006. The game is one of the most popular browser based games in the world, ranking among the top ten in number of players. There are over 59 million registered users. It has been reviewed by Gamestar and Forbes. In late 2012, Tribal Wars' mobile version became free for use by all players with improved features, including touch screen and graphical upgrades, which developer InnoGames attributed to a shift to \\"a higher mobile focus in general.\\" Game mechanics Each player controls their game from their village. From the main screen, the player can \\"visit\\" buildings such as the village headquarters to construct buildings, the barracks, stable, or workshop to recruit units, and the rally point to take command of units. Each screen can be accessed by clicking on a link, and the vast majority of the game is played through text based interinclude. Some players choose to place information such as in-game personal allies, ASCII art, or quotes. =Tribes= A large portion of the game revolves around the use of tribes, or semi-official groups of players. These players join together for mutual protection and guidance. The size of different tribes varies from world to world, depending on decisions of the tribal aristocracy (leadership council) and built-in limits on tribe size. Some worlds do not allow tribes of more than twenty-five members, while others have no limit on members. Tribes have the ability to set diplomacy with other tribes, and to create their own private tribal forum. Tribal diplomacy is non-binding, but any breach of diplomacy is generally frowned upon by other players .The victory of the world usually depends on a tribe-based objective that has to be met. Most tribes are created after the world in question has begun. However, groups of players will occasionally get together before a world starts to coordinate the set-up of a tribe. These \\"premade\\" tribes generally have more experienced players, but are not notably more successful than other tribes. Each tribe can assign a special set of privileges and titles specific to particular tribe members. Some of these titles involve Duke/Tribe Founder, Baron, Recruiter, Diplomat, Forum Moderator, and Council. Titles and privileges are usually given to players of leadership and experience. Furthermore, the majority of these players utilize a non-in-game mode of communication to ensure \\"effective,\\" and \\"covert,\\" conversation. =Combat= Combat in the game is heavily based on statistical attributes of troops, real-time waiting and attacking villages. A player can send their troops to another player's village either to reinforce or attack it. In the case of attacking, casualties are determined based on the number and type of troops sent, and factors such as morale and luck. Attacking troops who survived will then return to their original city with the plundered resources, should they be present in the city at the time of the attack. In order for a player to conquer other villages, a unit called a nobleman must be sent to attack a village and survive. After a successful attack the nobleman decreases the village loyalty anywhere from 20 to 35 points (out of 100). When the village loyalty falls to zero or below, the attacker takes full control of the village. Troops can be recruited for use in combat at the barracks, stable, and workshop, while noblemen can be created at the academy and a paladin can be created at the statue. Paladin weapons In some worlds there are weapons that the paladin can equip. These weapons usually enhance certain troops abilities, most commonly attack or defense statistics depending on the weapon. For example, the \\"Bonfire\\" looks like a flaming torch and greatly increases the offense and defense values of Catapults. The \\"Vasco's Scepter\\" adjusts the nobleman's ability to lower village loyalty to a minimum of 30. =Real-time interaction= All actions in the game take a pre-set amount of time. The time it takes a player's army to reach another village depends on the distance, as well as the predetermined \\"speed\\" of the attacking units. All units have their own speed and the entire army moves at the speed of its slowest component. Each building level has a longer base time for completion, though the amount of time a building upgrade actually takes for completion is dependent upon the level of the \\"Village Headquarters\\" A higher HQ level provides faster building upgrades. Higher levels troop production buildings, such as barracks, stable, and workshop facilitate faster recruitment speeds. It is not unusual for some actions to take hours, perhaps even days, to complete. Because the game takes place in real time many of the game's tactics are based on precision timing execution. For example, a common tactic to conquer an opponent's village is known as a \\"noble train\\" whereby an attacker sends multiple attacks in rapid succession with the first attack containing a full attack force (clearing out any defenses that may be in the village), while the subsequent attacks contain only one nobleman and a light escort, which will be able to land successfully after defenses have been eliminated. This method is necessary due to the fact that conquering a village requires lowering its loyalty from 100 percent to zero and each successful attacking nobleman lowers a village's loyalty by a randomly generated amount between 20 and 35 percent, while only one nobleman can be effective in a single attack command. While player skill, as well as the world's \\"attack gap\\" settings, influence the quality of a noble train, it is common for four man noble trains to have as little as 300 milliseconds difference from first attack landing to final attack landing. Consequently, a common defense that has been developed is known as \\"sniping\\" where a player will attempt to have defensive troops absent for the initial clearing attack, but arrive at the village in the milliseconds gap before the final noble lands, thus allowing a successful defense with minimal loss of defensive troops. A snipe may be accompanied by a precision counterattack known as \\"backtiming.\\" By knowing the speed of the attacking army, and knowing the distance between the player's village and his opponent's village, a skilled player can time a counterattack to land at his target just milliseconds after the attacking army returns to its origin, and subsequently kill the opponent's entire attack force, thus eliminating the threat. The quality of a backtime attack is based on how precisely it lags behind the original attack force, as skilled players may be able to dodge a backtime in less than one second by resending his army out to another village. In order to execute these techniques effectively will often require a player to become knowledgeable of the features of various web browsers, including the use of shortcuts and tabs, which allow a player to set up a tactic, and quickly switch to new tabs to click appropriate buttons to initiate the actions. There are also an assortment of tools that have been developed to assist players in making the necessary time calculations. Many guides and tutorials have been developed by the player community to assist novice players in developing their tactical skills. =Worlds= There are multiple \\"worlds\\" that can be played on, and each world has a unique set of rules to it, two of which are 'world speed' and 'troop speed', which commonly vary somewhere between 0.5 and 2, though some \\"speed rounds\\" have world speeds reaching into the hundreds. The world speed regulates how fast every action in the game occurs, while troop speed adjusts the speed of the moving units with respect to world speed. Furthermore, each world has varied settings upon technology, troops, weapons loot, and tribe limit. Each world adjust the types of troops available to the player, usually varying archers and paladin. The world can also adjust the availability of paladin weapons. Lastly, each world has its own specified victory qualifications, which a tribe has to meet before being declared the victorious tribe of the world. =Awards system= Tribal Wars utilizes an Award system reminiscent of Achievements/Trophies etc., where players gain \\"plaques\\" that they can show off on their profile for milestones. Awards add incentive for players to contribute to offensive operations both internally in their tribe and externally, support friends, and plunder and conquer other villages. Some Awards are satirical such as \\"Unlucky Fellow,\\" achieved by failing to conquer a village by 1 loyalty point. There are also five daily Awards: Looter (for farming the most resources), Plunderer (for looting the most villages), Attacker (for destroying the most enemy units as attacker), Defender (for destroying the most enemy units as defender), and Great Power (for conquering the most villages). Awards have 4 levels - Wood, Bronze, Silver and Gold. Wooden framed Awards are the most basic, consequentially Gold are the best and hardest to achieve. This system shows clearly how well a player has performed in certain aspects of the game. Awards are not shared between different worlds. Awards on one world are independent there, though they can be displayed on a player's profile on a different world to demonstrate the players previous experience as well as accomplishments. With the addition of flags to the game dynamic, earning awards of any type results in the reception of a flag of a certain level, correlating directly with the difficulty of the flag. With the Version 7.0 update, multiple new Awards were introduced, such as The Warlord (for attacking numerous players) and Brothers in Arms (for being a member of a tribe for a period of time). As of version 8.5, three new achievements were added: Master of Quests (measuring completed quests), Architect Drive (measuring number of construction assignments completed across all villages), and Recruitment Drive (measuring a total count of troops recruited across all villages). A fourth achievement, Out of Time, was announced to be released at a later time. =Victory= Originally, the goal of Tribal Wars was to have a single tribe/player conquer all villages in the world. However, the process of conquering a world could take several years. Recent worlds have alternate ways to achieve victory in an attempt to streamline world completion. such as holding specific villages for a set amount of time, or conquering a certain percentage of the world, while other worlds end after polling the remaining players. Therefore, unique world victory settings have been introduced. This \\"dominance\\" scenario of the endgame involves a tribe or a player to meet the criteria of minimum points/villages for a period of time. The world players are notified when the criteria is met and are provided a certain period of time prior to the world officially being declared \\"at end\\". Most recently the Secrets of Power where many different technologies are assigned to barbarian or bonus villages which need to be taken control of via ennoblement and then kept under a tribes control until one of each Secret is controlled, at which time an end-game counter will start. If the tribe holds on to the Secrets until the counter reaches zero, the world will enter peace settings and the world will eventually be closed. However, you can also achieve victory by defeating all your opponents. The \\"points/villages requirements\\" scenario of the endgame is the classical scenario of which a world was won. It is where a single tribe/player would own all player-owned villages within the world to declare world victory. However, this form of victory would then later be largely abandoned, due to its extensive nature, in favor of quicker and more suitable victory criteria.  Sequel  On November 20, 2013, InnoGames announced the release of the sequel to their original game after 10 years. The sequel was meant to incorporate its original components of strategy and teamwork, but also incorporates new elements of new artwork, updated game-play style, and modern technology. On September 2, 2014 the open beta for Tribal Wars was released. It maintained all its original buildings, along with three new ones: Hospital, Tavern, and Hall of Orders. From the Tavern the player can spy on other villages and also counter such spying from others.

Pacifastin inhibits the serine peptidases trypsin and chymotrypsin. All pacifastin members that have been characterized at the molecular level are precursor peptides composed of an N-terminal signal sequence followed by a precursor domain and a variable number of inhibitor domains. Each of these inhibitor domains carries a six-cysteine motif – see below. The first family members to be identified were isolated from Locusta migratoria migratoria (migratory locust) which were HI, LMCI-1 (PMP-D2) and LMCI-2 (PMP-C). A further five members, SGPI-1 to 5, were then isolated from Schistocerca gregaria (desert locust), and a heterodimeric serine protease inhibitor was isolated from the haemolymph of Pacifastacus leniusculus (Signal crayfish), and named pacifastin. Function Peptide proteinase inhibitors are in many cases synthesised as part of a larger precursor protein, referred to as a propeptide or zymogen, which remains inactive until the precursor domain is cleaved off in the lysosome, the precursor domain preventing access of the substrate to the active site until necessary. Proteinase inhibitors destined for secretion have an additional N-terminal signal-peptide domain which will be cleaved by a signal-peptidase. Removal of these one or two N-terminal inhibitor domains, either by interaction with a second peptidase or by autocatalytic cleavage, will activate the zymogen. Very little is known about the endogenous function of pacifastin-like inhibitors except that they may play roles in arthropod immunity and in regulation of the physiological processes involved in insect reproduction. Structure The inhibitor unit of pacifastin is a conserved pattern of six cysteine residues (Cys1 – Xaa9–12 – Cys2 – Asn – Xaa – Cys3 – Xaa – Cys4 – Xaa2–3 – Gly – Xaa3–6 – Cys5 – Thr – Xaa3 – Cys6). Detailed analysis of the 3-D structure shows that these six residues form three disulfide bridges (Cys1–4, Cys2–6, Cys3–5), giving members of the pacifastin family a typical fold and remarkable stability. Pacifastin is a 155kDa protein composed of two covalently linked subunits, which are separately encoded. The heavy chain of pacifastin (105 kDa) is related to transferrins as it carries three transferrin lobes, two of which seem to be active in iron binding. A number of the transferrin family members are also serine peptidases, and belong to MEROPS peptidase family S60 (INTERPRO). The light chain of pacifastin (44 kDa) is the proteinase inhibitory subunit, and consists of up to nine cysteine-rich inhibitory domains that are homologous to each other. The locust inhibitors share a conserved array of six residues with the pacifastin light chain. The structure of members of this family reveals that they consist of a triple-stranded antiparallel beta-sheet connected by three disulphide bridges. This family of serine protease inhibitors belongs to MEROPS inhibitor family I19, clan IW. They inhibit chymotrypsin, a peptidase belong to the S1 family (INTERPRO).

Life Graham was born in Harrow in 1898, one of five children of a housemaster at Harrow School. After working in child care and a hospital during World War One, for the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel and the College of the Ascension in Birmingham, she visited India with her father in 1926 and came into contact with Samuel Azariah, Bishop of Dornakal. Graham was captivated by his vision of a native Anglican Church and after some appropriate training returned to India to help galvanise potential leaders among women in the Church, working in the Dornakal diocese. In 1933 she was ordained a deaconess. After World War Two, Sister Carol was made secretary of a new organisation training women for leadership across the region which in 1947 would become covered by the Church of South India, uniting the Anglican, Methodist and Presbyterian traditions. From this effort was developed the Order of Women, which supported Church of India women workers called to a celibate life, based at Vishranthi Nilayam, the 'House of Refreshment', in a former orphanage in Bangalore. During this time Sister Carol wrote a variety of devotional books, especially encouraging the spiritual life of families in the home. From 1960 to 1963 she worked in North India on the organisation of women's work there. In 1963 Sister Carol retired and returned to the UK. She had already been discussing the idea of creating a community of women dedicated to working and praying for the unity of the Churches, and Eric Abbott, Dean of Westminster Abbey, offered to act as a sponsor of such a community. Eventually the former house of the Anglican spiritual director Fr Reginald Somerset Ward, 5 Wolseley Road in Farncombe, Surrey, was secured for the venture, which became known as the Farncombe Community. Sister Carol became Head Sister, promoting the work of the Community as well as leading it day-to-day. She travelled widely around the UK leading ecumenical retreats and quiet days. In accordance with the rules of the Community, Sister Carol retired on the last day of her seventy-fifth year, and went to live with her sister Elizabeth in Farnham. From there she moved to Smiles Home for the Elderly in Woking in 1985 and finally Bernard Sunley House, where she died in 1989.

It has served as a museum since 1985 and was listed as a cultural monument of local importance on February 17, 1983. The tower was built in 1912, when the water pipe system was laid out in Vinnytsia. The tower doubled as a fire observation point. The architect was Grigory Artynov. The water was taken from the Southern Bug River and then distributed around the city center. In 1920, the building stopped functioning as a water tower. During World War II it served as an observation tower, and after the war, it was converted into a residence.

Biography An early 20th-century Russian postcard picturing Saint Vladimir University in Kiev. Educated at the grammar school in Saratov and Moscow University, Minh then spent several years as an intern at the therapeutic clinic of Professor Zakharyin. As a young doctor studying typhoid's effects, he injected himself with typhoid blood, thus contracting the disease and nearly died from its complications. Between 1863 and 1865, he traveled to Germany to study pathological anatomy. In 1876, he took the chair as director of pathological anatomy at the University of Kiev, where he was subsequently (four years later) promoted to full professor. Study of leprosy, vitiligo and tzaraath Minh spent a decade studying leprosy and vitiligo in various parts of Russia. Having explored the foci of leprosy during a special expedition to Persia, Central Asia and the Caucasus, he gave a description of the clinic and epidemiology of leprosy, and proved that leprosy is an infectious disease. He likewise visited the Astrakhan steppes, the Kuban region, and as for as a trip to Egypt and the Levant, where he collected extensive material on the history of leprosy since ancient times. Minh maintained that the biblical tzaraath is synonymous with the modern term vitiligo.Проказа и песь, [Kiev], 1890. vol. 2 p. 53-94 Study of anthrax Studying the epidemiology of typhus and relapsing fever, he found that the carriers of these diseases where blood-sucking insects. His work, \\"Plague in Russia\\" (1898), written on the basis of the study of the epidemic in 1878-79 in the village of Vetlyanskaya (Vetluzhsky), was the work of his personal involvement therein; in this work, the characteristic of the clinic and the bubonic plague and pneumonic forms indicated the route of infection. He also found that both intestinal and pulmonary anthrax have a common origin. In 1873, he described the anthrax as bodies that migrate in cells, but was not able to properly assess the significance of this observation. Vetlyanskoy plague of 1879 Minh acquired widespread recognition due to his report on the vetlyanskoy plague of 1879.

Life He was probably born in Antwerp between 1595 and 1605. He was registered in the Antwerp Guild of Saint Luke as an apprentice in 1617-18. He was a pupil of Carel van Ferrara. He became a master in the Guild in the year 1621-1622.Philips de Marlier at the Netherlands Institute for Art History He worked for several years in Portugal. Legend has it that in Portugal he stabbed a Dominican priest to death. This event forced him to flee the country and return to Antwerp. Here he established a workshop where he trained several pupils, including Carstian Luyckx, Gabriël van Baesrode and Frans van Oorschot. He was also active as an art dealer and produced several copies of the work of other Antwerp artists such as Frans Francken the Younger. He died in Antwerp in 1667 or 1668. Work St Dorothea of Caesarea in a Flower Garland Only a few signed works of him exist and on the basis of these works some more works are attributed to him. He was a still life painter, in particular of flower pieces often including insects.Philips de Marlier at A. G. Leventis Gallery As in the work of other Antwerp painters of his generation such as Jan Brueghel the Younger, some of his flower paintings were dedicated to the presentation of a single variety of flowers.The Zoographia at Old Master Prints He also created garland paintings. Garland paintings are a special type of still life developed in Antwerp by artists such as Jan Brueghel the Elder, Hendrick van Balen, Frans Francken the Younger, Peter Paul Rubens and Daniel Seghers. They typically show a flower garland around a devotional image or portrait. Garland paintings were usually collaborations between a still life and a figure painter.Ursula Härting, Review of Susan Merriam, Seventeenth-Century Flemish Garland Paintings. Still Life, Vision and the Devotional ImageHuguette Vanagt, Daniël Seghers - Guirlande met de Heilige Theresia van Avila at Openbaar Kunstbezit Vlaanderen De Marlier and his studio often produced garland paintings in collaboration with other painters, such as Frans Francken the Younger, who painted the figures while de Marlier painted the garland. His oeuvre includes an early signed breakfast style still life (now in Abdij van 't Park, Heverlee, Belgium). This work, which is dated 1634, resembles similar still life paintings by Antwerp painters such as Osias Beert.Still Life by Philips de Marlier at BALAT The landscapes and history paintings attributed to him are likely copies of paintings by other masters made by him or his studio.

It is on the Campaign for Real Ale's National Inventory of Historic Pub Interiors. The half-timbered room known as the court room was the site of the trial of the conspirators in the Southampton Plot. This appears to be a local legend. The trial took place in 1415, about 75 years before the foundation of this building, and there is no documentary evidence from 1415 that would locate it here. In any case, the plotters were imprisoned in the castle and it is unlikely that they were moved down the High Street for a trial in an inn when the castle afforded ample facilities. A mournful procession of ghosts reportedly sighted leaving from the inn has been linked to the plotters. It has been claimed that the inn itself is haunted by a barmaid, described as being in her sixties and only visible above the knees, who reportedly drifts through the bar area. During his exile after 1852, Juan Manuel de Rosas, the former governor of Buenos Aires, used to frequent the place.

Founded in 1826 two miles from the Hudson River near the town of Haverstraw in Rockland County, the enterprise stumbled in its first year of existence and was terminated later that same year. History =Background= Robert Owen (1771-1858), social theorist who inspired the establishment of Franklin Community. The arrival of Welsh social reformer Robert Owen on American shores in the fall of 1824 was met with public curiosity and expectation. Owen's ideas about the relationship between human behavior and happiness and the material conditions of their existence were familiar to intellectuals in the United States from about 1817, when they were publicized in various British reviews.T.D. Seymour Bassett, \\"The Secular Utopian Socialists,\\" in Donald Drew Egbert and Stow Persons (eds.), Socialism and American Life: Volume 1. Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 1952; pg. 161. In response, those favoring the communitarian ideal had established an organization called the New York Society for Promoting Communities, a group headed by a Quaker apothecary named Cornelius C. Blatchly. It would be Blatchly and his associates who would welcome Owen to New York on November 4, 1824, presenting the visitor with a copy of the group's 1822 publication extracting Owen's writings, Essay on Common Wealths.Frank Podmore, Robert Owen: A Biography: Volume 1. London: Hutchinson & Co., 1906; pg. 289. A great popular interest surrounded Owen's arrival and subsequent announcement that he had purchased an entire established community in the state of Indiana from the Harmony Society for $140,000, with a view to establishing a model community to test his social theories in the crucible of practice.Frederick A. Bushee, Communistic Societies in the United States,\\" Political Science Quarterly, vol. 20, no. 4 (Dec. 1905), pg. 626. Despite — or perhaps due to — the distance between New York and the Owenite example on the American frontier in Indiana, interest grew in establishment parallel communities elsewhere. Despite the existence of the New York Society for Promoting Communities, it would not be the formal authority behind the creation of an Owenite colony; instead it would be a group of committed freethinkers from the New York City area, including atheist leader George Houston, who had previously suffered imprisonment in England for his anti-deist writings.Arthur Bestor, Backwoods Utopias: The Sectarian Origins and the Owenite Phase of Communitarian Socialism in America, 1663-1829. [1950] Enlarged 2nd Edition. Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press, 1970; pg. 203. =Establishment= In the spring of 1826 the Franklin Community was founded, with a preparatory constitution approved in March and a site selected the following month. The site selected was located about two miles from the Hudson River near the town of Haverstraw in Rockland County, New York. Included were 120 or 130 acres of farmland, with a purchase price of $16,000 or $18,000 stipulated.Bestor, Backwoods Utopias, pp. 203-204. The enterprise was named in honor of Benjamin Franklin (1709-1790), one of the founding fathers of the American republic. George Houston was named secretary of the new Owenite community. Families began to move in immediately, beginning to farm the land early in May 1826.Bestor, Backwoods Utopias, pg. 204. Many believed that their so-called \\"sweat equity\\" (to borrow a modern phrase) would be sufficient to attain membership in the community. Deprived of access to Robert Owen's purse, the fledgling community found it difficult to raise funds, only managing to raise the necessary one-third downpayment on June 23, 1826. A financial restructuring was required and the constitution was altered shortly thereafter to require a cash payment in exchange for community membership — a change which resulted in the great unhappiness of early participants, who felt themselves cheated and robbed of their pioneering labor. 190 years later the house stands today in the town of Haverstraw on the outskirts of the village of West Haverstraw. An article exists in the local paper titled \\"The short and unhappy life of a backwoods Utopia\\" by Isabelle Savell Adding to the discord was the arrival of Houston and his atheist associates, who immediately set about secularizing the community's schools, encouraging Sunday labor in violation of Biblical precepts, and establishing a \\"Church of Reason\\" — backing their actions with anti-religious quotations from Robert Owen's written works. =Termination and legacy= Underfinanced and wracked with discord, the Franklin Community failed about five months after the launch of the venture. Former secretary of the Franklin Community George Houston would found a new rationalist journal in January 1827, called The Correspondent. Houston would be joined in his editorial task by Abner Kneeland, whose subsequent trial for blasphemy would prove to be one of the landmark political events of the decade of the 1830s.
