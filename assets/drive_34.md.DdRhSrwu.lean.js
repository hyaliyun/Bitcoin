Born in Bene≈°ov, Czech Republic and grew up in ≈ò√≠ƒçany, she first rose to fame at age 17 as the first winner of ƒåesko hled√° SuperStar, the Czech version of Pop Idol, in June 2004. Later that year she released her first album, Spousta andƒõl≈Ø, which became a long-term bestseller in the Czech Republic. She has since released two further albums and is currently one of the most popular musical artists in the Czech Republic. In 2005 and 2006, she ranked first in the category 'Best Female Singer' in the Czech music poll ƒåesk√Ω slav√≠k. In 2004, 2007 and 2012 she placed first in the same category of the Andƒõl Awards, organized by the Czech Academy of Popular Music. She finished in second place in the Czech version of Dancing with the Stars - StarDance in 2010.  Biography  Langerov√° grew up in ≈ò√≠ƒçany, a town in the Central Bohemian Region. At age six, she began studying piano, and at age eight, she began taking guitar classes and singing in a choir with a local choir instructor. Langerov√° has credited her mother, who played piano and guitar around her house when she was growing up, with nurturing her musical talent. In her teenage years, Langerov√° became more serious about music. At age 14, Langerov√° joined a local band called SPB in S√°zava and then participated in and won several small TV talent contests (the Doremi TV competition and the Star Starters (in Czech: Rozjezdy pro hvƒõzdy) contest) before participating in the first season of ƒåesko hled√° SuperStar, a popular Czech television show based on the Pop Idol format. Langerov√° won the ƒåesko hled√° SuperStar competition with a 79 percent vote share in June 2004. In the course of the next three months, she quickly recorded her first album, Spousta andƒõl≈Ø (Many Angels), composed of songs written by professional pop songwriters. The album enjoyed chart success in the Czech Republic, remaining at the top for 11 weeks in 2005. In 2005 and 2006, Langerov√° toured, released a live album and DVD and was closely involved with the Svƒõtlu≈°ka Foundation, a charitable organization that works with blind children. Langerov√° played multiple benefit concerts for the organization and released a single, \\"P√≠se≈à pro svƒõtlu≈°ku\\" (Song for Svƒõtlu≈°ka, firefly in Czech), to raise money for the group. In 2007, Langerov√° released her second studio album, Dotyk (Contact), which showed her abilities beyond singing: she wrote or co-wrote all of the songs on the album and played guitar, piano, and bass on several tracks.  Personal life  Langerov√° is openly lesbian.

The model of this calculator proved to compete well with the higher end RPN HP-12C. Two versions of the 10B were produced, the first version came with orange lettering around the keys, the later model (in 2000) with teal-green labels. The functionality of the two versions appears to be identical. The successor HP 10bII (F1902A), which was introduced in 2001, is essentially a cosmetic upgrade offering the same overall functionality, but actually reduces the available numbered-storage registers from 15 to 10. Early production runs were of poor quality; newer calculators have apparently solved this shortcoming. In 2011, the 10bII was replaced by the HP 10bII+ (NW239AA) model 1 (codenamed \\"Bluestar\\") with expanded capabilities. This model also allows chain input. The 10bII+ uses a flashable Atmel AT91SAM7L128 processor with ARM7TDMI core. In 2015, the internal hardware of the HP 10bII+ changed to use an Atmel ATSAM4LC2CA processor with ARM Cortex-M4 core. The part number and physical appearance of model 2 didn't change except for a \\"Rev 2\\" plate on the bottom side. The serial numbers of the new model start with \\"PHA\\".

It was introduced in 1995 with a suggested retail price of 80 USD. HP credits a committee of eight high school, community college, and university teachers with assisting in the design of the calculator. The calculator is derived from and the hardware is based on the more powerful science/engineering oriented HP 48 series of machines. The HP 38G, unlike most of HP's other calculators, uses infix notation rather than Reverse Polish Notation (RPN), a postfix notation. Given the calculator's intended user-base of high school maths and science teachers and students, this is not surprising. The calculator is programmable, supporting small, interactive applications called \\"aplets\\". Successors After a HP 38G+http://www.hpmuseum.org/forum/thread-845-post-9199.html#pid9199 prototype was cancelled in 1998, the 38G was replaced in 2000 by the HP 39G and (in Europe and some other markets) HP 40G. The two models were differentiated by the inclusion of a Computer Algebra System (CAS) in the HP 40G. An unofficial method of operating the 40G's CAS on the 39G was addressed in the next follow- up device, the HP 39g+ introduced in 2003, for which there is no known CAS implementation. Further successors have included the HP 39gs and HP 40gs (with and without CAS) introduced in 2006, and the HP 39gII in 2011. Beginning with the 39g+, all of these successors have been built using an ARM architecture CPU with varying degrees of emulation to support software written for previous members of the series, and have gradually added more modern methods of connectivity such as USB to either replace or supplement the original RS-232 and IR.

It crystallizes in the monoclinic system and is the stable form of silver sulfide below . Argentite is the stable form above that temperature. As argentite cools below that temperature its cubic form is distorted to the monoclinic form of acanthite. Below 173 ¬∞C acanthite forms directly. Acanthite is the only stable form in normal air temperature. Occurrence Acanthite is a common silver mineral in moderately low-temperature hydrothermal veins and in zones of supergene enrichment. It occurs in association with native silver, pyrargyrite, proustite, polybasite, stephanite, aguilarite, galena, chalcopyrite, sphalerite, calcite and quartz. Acanthite was first described in 1855 for an occurrence in the J√°chymov (St Joachimsthal) District, Kru≈°n√© Hory Mts (Erzgebirge), Karlovy Vary Region, Bohemia, Czech Republic.

It occurs as an oxidation product of primary lead sulfide ore, galena. Anglesite occurs as prismatic orthorhombic crystals and earthy masses, and is isomorphous with barite and celestine. It contains 74% of lead by mass and therefore has a high specific gravity of 6.3. Anglesite's color is white or gray with pale yellow streaks. It may be dark gray if impure. It was first recognized as a mineral species by William Withering in 1783, who discovered it in the Parys copper- mine in Anglesey; the name anglesite, from this locality, was given by F. S. Beudant in 1832. The crystals from Anglesey, which were formerly found abundantly on a matrix of dull limonite, are small in size and simple in form, being usually bounded by four faces of a prism and four faces of a dome; they are brownish-yellow in colour owing to a stain of limonite. Crystals from some other localities, notably from in Sardinia, are transparent and colourless, possessed of a brilliant adamantine lustre, and usually modified by numerous bright faces. The variety of combinations and habits presented by the crystals is very extensive, nearly two hundred distinct forms being figured by V. von Lang in his monograph of the species; without measurement of the angles the crystals are frequently difficult to decipher. There are distinct cleavages parallel to the faces of the prism (110) and the basal plane (001), but these are not so well developed as in the isomorphous minerals barite and celestite. Anglesite is a mineral of secondary origin, having been formed by the oxidation of galena in the upper parts of mineral lodes where these have been affected by weathering processes. At Monteponi the crystals encrust cavities in glistening granular galena; and from Leadhills, in Scotland, pseudomorphs of anglesite after galena are known. At most localities it is found as isolated crystals in the lead-bearing lodes, but at some places, in Australia and Mexico, it occurs as large masses, and is then mined as an ore of lead. Anglesite is sometimes used as a gemstone.

It is a white crystalline solid that is odorless and insoluble in water. It occurs as the mineral baryte, which is the main commercial source of barium and materials prepared from it. The white opaque appearance and its high density are exploited in its main applications.Holleman, A. F. and Wiberg, E. (2001) Inorganic Chemistry, San Diego, CA : Academic Press, Uses=Drilling fluids About 80% of the world's barium sulfate production, mostly purified mineral, is consumed as a component of oil well drilling fluid. It increases the density of the fluid,Robert Kresse, Ulrich Baudis, Paul J√§ger, H. Hermann Riechers, Heinz Wagner, Jochen Winkler, Hans Uwe Wolf, \\"Barium and Barium Compounds\\" in Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry, 2007 Wiley-VCH, Weinheim. increasing the hydrostatic pressure in the well and reducing the chance of a blowout. Radiocontrast agent Barium sulfate in suspension is frequently used medically as a radiocontrast agent for X-ray imaging and other diagnostic procedures. It is most often used in imaging of the GI tract during what is colloquially known as a \\"barium meal\\". It is administered orally, or by enema, as a suspension of fine particles in a thick milk-like solution (often with sweetening and flavoring agents added). Although barium is a heavy metal, and its water- soluble compounds are often highly toxic, the low solubility of barium sulfate protects the patient from absorbing harmful amounts of the metal. Barium sulfate is also readily removed from the body, unlike Thorotrast, which it replaced. Due to the relatively high atomic number (Z = 56) of barium, its compounds absorb X-rays more strongly than compounds derived from lighter nuclei. Pigment The majority of synthetic barium sulfate is used as a component of white pigment for paints. In oil paint, barium sulfate is almost transparent, and is used as a filler or to modify consistency. One major manufacturer of artists' oil paint sells \\"permanent white\\" that contains a mixture of titanium white pigment (TiO2) and barium sulfate. The combination of barium sulfate and zinc sulfide (ZnS) is the inorganic pigment called lithopone. In photography it is used as a coating for certain photographic papers. Paper brightener A thin layer of barium sulfate called baryta is first coated on the base surface of most photographic paper to increase the reflectiveness of the image, with the first such paper introduced in 1884 in Germany.The Getty Conservation Institute, Silver Gelatin. The Atlas of Analytical Signatures of Photographic Processes. J. Paul Getty Trust, 2013. The light-sensitive silver halide emulsion is then coated over the baryta layer. The baryta coating limits the penetration of the emulsion into the fibers of the paper and makes the emulsion more even, resulting in more uniform blacks.Salvaggio, Nanette L. Basic Photographic Materials and Processes. Taylor & Francis US, Oct 27, 2008. p. 362. (Further coatings may then be present for fixing and protection of the image.) More recently, baryta has been used to brighten papers intended for ink-jet printing.Nikitas, Theano. \\"Inkjet papers that will give your photos pizzazz: are you and your clients bored with your photo prints? check out our favorite fine-art and specialty inkjet papers that are sure to make your images stand out.\\" Photo District News July 2012: 36+. General Reference Center GOLD. Web. 3 Nov. 2012. Plastics filler Barium sulfate is commonly used as a filler for plastics to increase the density of the polymer in vibrational mass damping applications. In polypropylene and polystyrene plastics, it is used as a filler in proportions up to 70%. It has an effect of increasing acid and alkali resistance and opacity. Such composites are also used as X-Ray shielding materials due to their enhanched radiopacity. Composites with high weight percentage (70-80%) of barium sulfate perform better than commonly used steel shields. Niche uses Barium sulfate is used in soil testing. Tests for soil pH and other qualities of soil use colored indicators, and small particles (usually clay) from the soil can cloud the test mixture and make it hard to see the color of the indicator. Barium sulfate added to the mixture binds with these particles, making them heavier so they fall to the bottom, leaving a clearer solution. In colorimetry, barium sulfate is used as a near- perfect diffuser when measuring light sources. In metal casting, the moulds used are often coated with barium sulfate in order to prevent the molten metal from bonding with the mould. It is also used in brake linings, anacoustic foams, powder coatings, and root canal filling. Barium sulfate is an ingredient in the \\"rubber\\" pellets used by Chilean police. This together with silica helps the pellet attain a 96.5 shore A hardness. =Catalyst support= Barium sulfate is used as a catalyst support when selectively hydrogenating functional groups that are sensitive to overreduction. With a low surface area, the contact time of the substrate with the catalyst is shorter and thus selectivity is achieved. Palladium on barium sulfate is also used as a catalyst in the Rosenmund reduction. =Pyrotechnics= As barium compounds emit a green light when burned, barium salts are often used in green pyrotechnic formulas, although nitrate and chlorate salts are more common. Barium sulfate is commonly used as a component of \\"strobe\\" pyrotechnic compositions. =Copper industry= As barium sulfate has high melting point and is insoluble in water, it is used as a release material in casting of copper anode plates. The anode plates are cast in copper molds, so to avoid the contact of the liquid copper and the solid copper mold, a solution of barium sulfate in water is used as a coating on the mold surface. Thus when the liquid copper solidifies in form of an anode plate it can be easily released from its mold. = Radiometric measurements = Barium sulfate is sometimes used (or else PTFE) to coat the interior of integrating spheres due to the high reflectance of the material and near Lambertian characteristics. Production Almost all of the barium consumed commercially is obtained from barite, which is often highly impure. Barite is processed by carbothermal reduction (heating with coke) to give barium sulfide: : BaSO4 \\\\+ 4 C ‚Üí BaS + 4 CO In contrast to barium sulfate, barium sulfide is soluble in water and readily converted to the oxide, carbonate, and halides. To produce highly pure barium sulfate, the sulfide or chloride is treated with sulfuric acid or sulfate salts: : BaS + H2SO4 ‚Üí BaSO4 \\\\+ H2S Barium sulfate produced in this way is often called blanc fixe, which is French for \\"permanent white.\\" Blanc fixe is the form of barium encountered in consumer products, such as paints. In the laboratory barium sulfate is generated by combining solutions of barium ions and sulfate salts. Because barium sulfate is the least toxic salt of barium due to its insolubility, wastes containing barium salts are sometimes treated with sodium sulfate to immobilize (detoxify) the barium. Barium sulfate is one of the most insoluble salts of sulfate. Its low solubility is exploited in qualitative inorganic analysis as a test for Ba2+ ions as well as for sulfate. History Barium sulfate is reduced to barium sulfide by carbon. The accidental discovery of this conversion many centuries ago led to the discovery of the first synthetic phosphor. The sulfide, unlike the sulfate, is water-soluble. During the early part of the 20th century, during the Japanese colonization period, hokutolite was found to exist naturally in the Beitou hot-springs area near Taipei City, Taiwan. Hokutolite is a radioactive mineral composed mostly of PbSO4 and BaSO4, but also containing traces of uranium, thorium and radium. The Japanese harvested these elements for industrial uses, and also developed dozens of ‚Äútherapeutic hot-spring baths‚Äù in the area. Safety aspects Although soluble salts of barium are moderately toxic to humans, barium sulfate is nontoxic due to its insolubility. The most common means of inadvertent barium poisoning arises from the consumption of soluble barium salts mislabeled as BaSO4. In the Celobar incident (Brazil, 2003), nine patients died from improperly prepared radiocontrast agent.

It belongs to halides and is a sea salt concentrate. It contains many macro- and micro-elements vital for human health, in much higher concentrations than can be found in sea or ocean salt. The main bischofit compound is magnesium chloride (up to 350 g/L), moreover, it contains about 70 other elements as impurities, including potassium, sodium, bromine, boron, calcium, silicon, molybdenum, silver, zinc, iron and copper. History Bischofite is named in honor of German geologist Gustav Bischof (1792‚Äì1870). Its discovery (1877) is attributed to Carl-Christian Ochsenius.Ochsenius, C. (1877): Die Bildung der Steinsalzlager und ihrer Mutterlaugensalze unter specieller Ber√ºcksichtigung der Fl√∂ze von Douglashall in der Egeln¬¥schen Mulde. Verlag Pfeffer (Halle), 172 p. At its type locality bischofite it an evaporite formed in an ancient seabed, which was deposited more than 200 million years ago, during the Permian Period. In 1930‚Äì1950, vast bischofite deposits were discovered near the Volga River in Russia. The mineral is mined by dissolving an underground dry mineral stratum with artesian water. The resulting brine is pumped out. Deposits Bischofite deposits differ by their composition: some of them are salt basins where bischofite is mixed with other minerals such as carnallite, halite, kieserite and anhydrite. These are the so-called bischofite containing rocks which have pink-brown-yellow and orange-red colors. They contain 36‚Äì58% of bischofite. Carnallite deposits are known in Sta√üfurt, Germany ‚Äì where bischofite was first discovered, and carnallite is one of the most important minerals in potassium salt deposits (Solykam deposit, Ural, Russia). Sub-surface bischofite layers were also discovered in Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan, China and the US. There are bischofite-rich deposits with concentrations of 93‚Äì96% of the mineral. One of those rare deposits is located in the Volgograd region of Russia. Another one was found in 1990s in the Poltava region in Ukraine. This is one of the deepest () and oldest bischofite deposits. Applications Bischofite has many applications ranging from construction materials (tile, stone) to agriculture (preplant seeds, plant processing during vegetation period), oil extraction (for grouting and solidifying mortars), medical and chemical industry (production of magnesium metal). Bishofite is used in form of compresses to treat joint diseases such as arthritis, rheumatic fever osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, radiculitis, calcaneal spur and traumas, especially in rehabilitation centers in Ukraine, Russia, Belarus, and Lithuania. Bischofite is also applied in gel form. Bischofite is used in the production of the industrial Sorel cement and synthetic carnallite. Bischofite solution is applied to deice roads, similar to sodium chloride, but it is less corrosive. It is also used in agriculture, veterinary medicine and cattle breeding to increase the crop yield and treat animals.

It is colorless or greyish-white, yellowish, sometimes violet in color, and varies from translucent to transparent. It may be readily distinguished from other colorless transparent minerals with a perfect cleavage and pearly luster‚Äîlike mica, talc, brucite, and gypsum‚Äî by its greater hardness of 6.5 - 7. The specific gravity is 3.4. When heated before the blowpipe it decrepitates violently, breaking up into white pearly scales. The mineral occurs as an alteration product of corundum or emery and is found in granular limestone and other crystalline rocks. Well-developed crystals are found in the emery deposits of the Urals and at Chester, Massachusetts, and in kaolin at Schemnitz in Hungary. If obtainable in large quantity, it would be of economic importance as a source of aluminium. Diaspore, along with gibbsite and boehmite, is a major component of the aluminium ore bauxite.

It pioneered a number of digital communications concepts, including the first transmission of speech using pulse-code modulation. The name SIGSALY was not an acronym, but a cover name that resembled an acronym‚Äîthe SIG part was common in Army Signal Corps names (e.g., SIGABA). The prototype was called the \\"Green Hornet\\" after the radio show The Green Hornet, because it sounded like a buzzing hornet, resembling the show's theme tune, to anyone trying to eavesdrop on the conversation. Development At the time of its inception, long-distance telephone communications were broadcast using the \\"A-3\\" voice scrambler developed by Western Electric. The Germans had a listening station on the Dutch coast which could intercept and break A-3 traffic.The SIGSALY Story, by Patrick D. Weadon, National Security Agency/Central Security Service Although telephone scramblers were used by both sides in World War II, they were known not to be very secure in general, and both sides often cracked the scrambled conversations of the other. Inspection of the audio spectrum using a spectrum analyzer often provided significant clues to the scrambling technique. The insecurity of most telephone scrambler schemes led to the development of a more secure scrambler, based on the one-time pad principle. A prototype was developed at Bell Telephone Laboratories, under the direction of A. B. Clark, assisted by British mathematician Alan Turing, and demonstrated to the US Army. The Army was impressed and awarded Bell Labs a contract for two systems in 1942. SIGSALY went into service in 1943 and remained in service until 1946. Operation SIGSALY used a random noise mask to encrypt voice conversations which had been encoded by a vocoder. The latter was used both to minimize the amount of redundancy (which is high in voice traffic), and also to reduce the amount of information to be encrypted. The voice encoding used the fact that speech varies fairly slowly as the components of the throat move. The system extracts information about the voice signal 50 times a second (every 20 milliseconds). Jon D. Paul. \\"Rebuilding a Piece of the First Digital Voice Scrambler\\". IEEE Spectrum. 2019\\\\. * ten channels covering the telephone passband (250 Hz ‚Äì 2,950 Hz); are rectified and filtered to extract how much energy is in each of these channels. * another signal indicating whether the sound is voiced or unvoiced; * if voiced, a signal indicating the pitch; this also varied at less than 25 Hz. Next, each signal was sampled for its amplitude once every 20 milliseconds. For the band amplitude signals, the amplitude converted into one of six amplitude levels, with values from 0 through 5. The amplitude levels were on a nonlinear scale, with the steps between levels wide at high amplitudes and narrower at low amplitudes. This scheme, known as \\"companding\\" or \\"compressing-expanding\\", exploits the fact that the fidelity of voice signals is more sensitive to low amplitudes than to high amplitudes. The pitch signal, which required greater sensitivity, was encoded by a pair of six-level values (one coarse, and one fine), giving thirty-six levels in all. A cryptographic key, consisting of a series of random values from the same set of six levels, was subtracted from each sampled voice amplitude value to encrypt them before transmission. The subtraction was performed using modular arithmetic: a \\"wraparound\\" fashion, meaning that if there was a negative result, it was added to six to give a positive result. For example, if the voice amplitude value was 3 and the random value was 5, then the subtraction would work as follows: :3 - 5 \\\\equiv -2,\\\\ -2 + 6 \\\\equiv 4\\\\pmod 6 \\\\, -- giving a value of 4. The sampled value was then transmitted, with each sample level transmitted on one of six corresponding frequencies in a frequency band, a scheme known as \\"frequency- shift keying (FSK)\\". The receiving SIGSALY read the frequency values, converted them into samples, and added the key values back to them to decrypt them. The addition was also performed in a \\"modulo\\" fashion, with six subtracted from any value over five. To match the example above, if the receiving SIGSALY got a sample value of 4 with a matching random value of 5, then the addition would be as follows: :4 + 5 \\\\equiv 9,\\\\ 9 - 6 \\\\equiv 3\\\\pmod 6 \\\\, -- which gives the correct value of 3. To convert the samples back into a voice waveform, they were first turned back into the dozen low-frequency vocoded signals. An inversion of the vocoder process was employed, which included: * a white noise source (used for unvoiced sounds); * a signal generator (used for voiced sounds) generating a set of harmonics, with the base frequency controlled by the pitch signal; * a switch, controlled by the voiced/unvoiced signal, to select one of these two as a source; * a set of filters (one for each band), all taking as input the same source (the source selected by the switch), along with amplifiers whose gain was controlled by the band amplitude signals. The noise values used for the encryption key were originally produced by large mercury-vapor rectifying vacuum tubes and stored on a phonograph record. The record was then duplicated, with the records being distributed to SIGSALY systems on both ends of a conversation. The records served as the SIGSALY \\"one-time pad\\", and distribution was very strictly controlled (although if one had been seized, it would have been of little importance, since only one pair of each was ever produced). For testing and setup purposes, a pseudo-random number generating system made out of relays, known as the \\"threshing machine\\", was used. The records were played on turntables, but since the timing ‚Äì the clock synchronization ‚Äì between the two SIGSALY terminals had to be precise, the turntables were by no means just ordinary record-players. The rotation rate of the turntables was carefully controlled, and the records were started at highly specific times, based on precision time-of-day clock standards. Since each record only provided 12 minutes of key, each SIGSALY had two turntables, with a second record \\"queued up\\" while the first was \\"playing\\". Usage A SIGSALY terminal in 1943. The SIGSALY terminal was massive, consisting of 40 racks of equipment. It weighed over 50 tons, and used about 30 kW of power, necessitating an air-conditioned room to hold it. Too big and cumbersome for general use, it was only used for the highest level of voice communications. A dozen SIGSALY terminal installations were eventually set up all over the world. The first was installed in the Pentagon building rather than the White House, which had an extension line, as the US President Franklin Roosevelt knew of the British Prime Minister Winston Churchill's insistence that he be able to call at any time of the day or night. The second was installed below street level in the basement of Selfridges department store on Oxford Street, London, close to the US Embassy on Grosvenor Square. The first conference took place on 15 July 1943, and it was used by both General Dwight D. Eisenhower as the commander of SHAEF, and Churchill, before extensions were installed to the Embassy, 10 Downing Street and the Cabinet War Rooms. One was installed in a ship and followed General Douglas MacArthur during his South Pacific campaigns. In total during WW2, the system supported about 3,000 high-level telephone conferences. The installation and maintenance of all SIGSALY machines was undertaken by the specially formed and vetted members of the 805th Signal Service Company of the US Army Signal Corps. The system was cumbersome, but it worked very effectively. When the Allies invaded Germany, an investigative team discovered that the Germans had recorded significant amounts of traffic from the system, but had erroneously concluded that it was a complex telegraphic encoding system. A recording of Churchill talking to Roosevelt is on display in the Houses of Parliament. The timing of the recorded signal occasionally varies from that received. The spoken words were added to a very loud Beethoven recording which can occasionally be heard. Significance SIGSALY has been credited with a number of \\"firsts\\"; this list is taken from (Bennett, 1983): # The first realization of enciphered telephony # The first quantized speech transmission # The first transmission of speech by pulse code modulation (PCM) # The first use of companded PCM # The first examples of multilevel frequency shift keying (FSK) # The first useful realization of speech bandwidth compression # The first use of FSK - FDM (Frequency Shift Keying-Frequency Division Multiplex) as a viable transmission method over a fading medium # The first use of a multilevel \\"eye pattern\\" to adjust the sampling intervals (a new, and important, instrumentation technique) See also * Spread spectrum * STU-III -- a more recent voice encryption system.

The manuscript derives its name from the colour of its leather binding and from its association with Hergest Court between the late 15th and early 17th century. Compilation The manuscript was written between about 1382 and 1410. One of the several copyists responsible for the manuscript has been identified as Hywel Fychan fab Hywel Goch of Buellt. He is known to have worked for Hopcyn ap Tomas ab Einion ( 1330‚Äì1403) of Ynysforgan, Swansea, and it is possible that the manuscript was compiled for Hopcyn.

The Red Book soon passed into the possession of the Vaughans of Hergest Court, near Kington in the Welsh Marches. Sir John Price of Brecon reports to have seen the manuscript in 1550, presumably at Hergest. In the late 1560s, William Salesbury found the manuscript in the possession of Sir Henry Sidney at Ludlow, when Siancyn Gwyn of Llanidloes held it on loan from him. By the early 17th century, the Red Book had passed to the Mansels of Margam, hence back in Glamorgan. It was possibly brought into the marriage between Henry's granddaughter Catherine Sidney and Sir Lewis Mansel, who is reported to have owned it in 1634. The manuscript was later found in the collection of Thomas Wilkins (d. 1699), a Welsh clergyman and antiquarian, who may have borrowed it from the Mansels without ever returning it. In 1697, Wilkins was visited by Edward Lhuyd who spent some time copying a manuscript which might well have been the Red Book. In 1701, two years after Wilkin's death, his son Thomas Wilkins the Younger donated the manuscript to Jesus College, Oxford. Internal evidence, a note by the latter Wilkins, suggests that Edward Lhuyd then held the manuscript on loan, but that the college was able to retrieve it only 13 years later, after Lhuyd's death. The book was given on 17 February 1701 to Jesus College by Reverend Thomas Wilkins the younger of Llanblethian. The college keeps the manuscript on deposit at the Bodleian Library.Red Book of Hergest  Content  The Red Book of Hergest, columns 240‚Äì241. The first part of the manuscript contains prose, including the Mabinogion, for which this is one of the manuscript sources, other tales, historical texts (including a Welsh translation of Geoffrey of Monmouth's Historia Regum Britanniae), and various other texts including a series of Triads. The rest of the manuscript contains poetry, especially from the period of court poetry known as Poetry of the Princes (Welsh: Gogynfeirdd or Beirdd y Tywysogion), including the cycles Canu Llywarch Hen, Canu Urien, and Canu Heledd. The Red Book is similar in content to the White book of Rhydderch, of which it has at times been supposed to be a copy. Both are now thought, however, to descend from a lost common ancestor or ancestors.Jenny Rowland, Early Welsh Saga Poetry: A Study and Edition of the 'Englynion' (Cambridge: Brewer, 1990), p. 393. The manuscript also contains a collection of herbal remedies associated with Rhiwallon Feddyg, founder of a medical dynasty that lasted over 500 years ‚Äì 'The Physicians of Myddfai' from the village of Myddfai just outside Llandovery. Influence J. R. R. Tolkien borrowed the title for the Red Book of Westmarch, the imagined legendary source of Tolkien's tales.David Day. Tolkien‚Äôs Ring, page 79: ‚ÄúBesides those elements already mentioned, Celtic mythology has played a fundamental part in the shaping of Tolkien‚Äôs world. When we learn that the most important source of Welsh Celtic lore was preserved in the fourteenth-century Red Book of Hergest, we realize that Tolkien is making a small scholarly joke in naming his 'source' of Elf-lore the Red Book of Westmarch.‚ÄùHooker, Mark T. Tolkienian mathomium: a collection of articles on J. R. R. Tolkien and his legendarium: \\"The Feigned-manuscript Topos\\", pp. 176-177: ‚ÄúThe 1849 translation of The Red Book of Hergest by Lady Charlotte Guest (1812-1895), which is more widely known as The Mabinogion, is likewise of undoubted authenticity [...] It is now housed in the library at Jesus College, Oxford. Tolkien's well-known love of Welsh suggests that he would have likewise been well-acquainted with the source of Lady Guest‚Äôs translation.‚ÄùFor the Tolkiennymist, the coincidence of the names of the sources of Lady Charlotte Guest‚Äôs and Tolkien‚Äôs translations is striking: The Red Book of Hergest and the Red Book of Westmarch. Tolkien wanted to write (translate) a mythology for England, and Lady Charlotte Guest's work can easily be said to be a ‚Äòmythology for Wales‚Äô. The implication of this coincidence is intriguing.‚Äù See also * White Book of Hergest * White Book of Rhydderch NotesSources *'Red book of Hergest'. In Meic Stephens (Ed.)

Early life Carroll was born on May 4, 1794 in Hagerstown, Maryland. He was the son of Charles Carroll (1767‚Äì1823) and Anne Sprigg (1769‚Äì1837). His siblings included William Thomas Carroll and Elizabeth Barbara Carroll (1806‚Äì1866), who was married to Henry Fitzhugh (1801‚Äì1866), an Erie Canal Commissioner and member of the New York State Assembly and the sister of Ann Carroll Fitzhugh, wife of Gerrit Smith. Carroll's paternal grandfather was Charles Carroll of Duddington (1729‚Äì1773), himself the grandson of Charles Carroll (1661-1720), a native of England who emigrated to Maryland in 1689. His grandfather was the nephew of Charles Carroll of Annapolis and a cousin of Charles Carroll of Carrollton, a signor of the Declaration of Independence. Along with his parents, the Carroll family left Maryland for Genesee County, New York in 1811. Carroll graduated from St. Mary's College in Baltimore, Maryland in 1813. Career He was a member of the New York State Senate (8th D.) from 1827 to 1828, sitting in the 50th and 51st New York State Legislatures. He resigned his seat in March 1828. He was a member of the New York State Assembly (Livingston Co.) in 1836. He was Chairman of the Whig state convention of 1842. Carroll was known as an admirer of Henry Clay. He was elected as a Whig to the 28th and 29th United States Congresses, holding office from March 4, 1843, to March 3, 1847. Caroll was not a candidate for renomination in 1846. Later life After retiring from Congress, Carroll returned to Groveland and managed his large landed estate, \\"The Hermitage\\". He was presidential elector on the American Party ticket in 1856. Personal life Carroll was married to Alida Maria Van Rensselaer (1801‚Äì1832) the daughter of Jeremiah Van Rensselaer (1769‚Äì1829). Alida was the niece of Jacob Rutsen Van Rensselaer and the granddaughter of Robert Van Rensselaer (1740‚Äì1802). Her older sister, Cornelia Rutsen Van Rensselaer (b. 1798), was married to Rep. Francis Granger. They lived at a homestead known as \\"The Hermitage\\" in Groveland, New York. Together, they were the parents of six children, only two of which survived to maturity: * Henry Carroll (1821‚Äì1828), who died young. * Charles Carroll (1823‚Äì1830), who died young. * Cornelia Granger Carroll (1826‚Äì1909), who married Edward Philo Fuller (1820‚Äì1866), son of Congressman Philo C. Fuller, in 1850. * Anne Elizabeth Carroll (1828‚Äì1905), who married William Dana Fitzhugh (1824‚Äì1889), son of Dr. Daniel H. Fitzhugh and nephew of Henry Fitzhugh, in 1849. * Adeline V. Carroll (1830‚Äì1860), who died unmarried. * Alida Carroll (1831‚Äì1831), who died young. After his wife's early death in 1832, her sister, Catharine Schuyler Van Rensselaer (1802‚Äì1873), who never married, lived at \\"The Hermitage\\" and acted as a second mother to the Carroll girls. Carroll died in Groveland on June 8, 1865. He was buried at the Williamsburg Cemetery in Groveland. Descendants Through his daughter Cornelia, he was the grandfather of Sophia Fuller (b. 1854) who married Edwin Forrest Sweet (1847‚Äì1935), a Congressman and Mayor of Grand Rapids, Michigan (from 1904‚Äì05) and Philo Carroll Fuller (1857‚Äì1931), who also served as Mayor of Grand Rapids in 1917. The Sweets were the parents of Carroll Fuller Sweet (b. 1877), George Sweet (b. 1881), Sidney Edward Sweet (b. 1883), Cornelia Van Rensselaer Sweet (b. 1886), Sophia Fuller Sweet (b. 1892). Through his daughter Anne, he was the grandfather of Anne Fitzhugh (b. 1850), Alida Catharine Fitzhugh, who died in Texas, Carroll Fitzhugh (d. 1880), Cornelia F. Fitzhugh, who married Richard Field Conover (1858‚Äì1930), Edward F. Fitzhugh, a chemist.

A matchbox is a box made of cardboard or thin wood and designed to hold matches. It usually has a coarse striking surface on one edge for lighting the matches contained inside. Etymology The word, derived from Greek phil- [loving] + Latin lumen- [light], was introduced by the British collector Marjorie S. Evans in 1943 (who later became president of the British Matchbox Label & Booklet Society, now renamed the British Matchbox Label and Bookmatch Society). A person who engages in phillumeny is a phillumenist. These two forms have been adopted by many other languages, e.g., philum√©niste, fillumenista, Filumenist and —Ñ–∏–ª—É–º–µ–Ω–∏—Å—Ç. Phillumeny worldwide Polish matches from the Czƒôstochowa match factory Collecting of matchbox labels emerged together with matches. In some collections it is possible to find labels from chemical matches, produced from 1810-1815‚Äîlong before the modern matches arrived. Quite often people who went abroad brought back matchboxes as souvenirs from other countries. After World War II a lot of match factories worked in close contact with local phillumenists, issuing special non- advertising sets. The hobby became especially widespread from the 1960s through the 1980s. Widespread introduction of bulky (for collectors) cardboard matchboxes with less distinct images on them, much poorer quality of print and, also some social phenomena, made this hobby (like many others, not connected with commerce) much less engaged.  Notable phillumenists  In Japan, Teiichi Yoshizawa was listed in the Guinness Book of World Records as the world's top phillumenist. In Portugal, Jose Manuel Pereira published a series of albums to catalog and display matchbox collections called \\"Phillalbum\\".

(2006) Oxford Dictionary of Statistics, OUP. :*procedures in statistical classification to determine class membership probabilities which assess the uncertainty of a given new observation belonging to each of the already established classes. In addition, \\"calibration\\" is used in statistics with the usual general meaning of calibration. For example, model calibration can be also used to refer to Bayesian inference about the value of a model's parameters, given some data set, or more generally to any type of fitting of a statistical model. As Philip Dawid puts it, \\"a forecaster is well calibrated if, for example, of those events to which he assigns a probability 30 percent, the long-run proportion that actually occurs turns out to be 30 percent\\". In regression The calibration problem in regression is the use of known data on the observed relationship between a dependent variable and an independent variable to make estimates of other values of the independent variable from new observations of the dependent variable.Brown, P.J. (1994) Measurement, Regression and Calibration, OUP. Ng, K. H., Pooi, A. H.

(1998) Applied Regression analysis, 3rd Edition, Wiley. see also sliced inverse regression. One example is that of dating objects, using observable evidence such as tree rings for dendrochronology or carbon-14 for radiometric dating. The observation is caused by the age of the object being dated, rather than the reverse, and the aim is to use the method for estimating dates based on new observations. The problem is whether the model used for relating known ages with observations should aim to minimise the error in the observation, or minimise the error in the date. The two approaches will produce different results, and the difference will increase if the model is then used for extrapolation at some distance from the known results. In classification Calibration in classification means turning transform classifier scores into class membership probabilities. An overview of calibration methods for two- class and multi-class classification tasks is given by Gebel (2009) . The following univariate calibration methods exist for transforming classifier scores into class membership probabilities in the two-class case: * Assignment value approach, see Garczarek (2002)U. M.

Philip E. Tetlock employs the term \\"calibration\\" in this sense in his 2015 book Superforecasting. This differs from accuracy and precision. For example, as expressed by Daniel Kahneman, \\"if you give all events that happen a probability of .6 and all the events that don‚Äôt happen a probability of .4, your discrimination is perfect but your calibration is miserable\\". Aggregative Contingent Estimation was a program of the Office of Incisive Analysis (OIA) at the Intelligence Advanced Research Projects Activity (IARPA) that sponsored research and forecasting tournaments in partnership with The Good Judgment Project, co-created by Philip E. Tetlock, Barbara Mellers, and Don Moore. In meteorology, in particular, as concerns weather forecasting, a related mode of assessment is known as forecast skill.

The ATI went to court in an attempt to block the order, but its request was rejected on June 13. The ATI began to comply with the court's order in stages on June 15. On August 15 a Tunis appeals court upheld the previous decisions requiring the ATI to block access to pornographic websites. The ATI is undergoing an appeals process with country's highest court on the grounds that it cannot uphold the ruling because it lacks the financial and technical means to implement a sufficient filtering and censorship system.\\"Tunis court upholds order requiring filtering of porn sites\\", Reporters Without Borders, 16 August 2011 Reporters Without Borders fears that porn-site filtering could lead to further reversals in recently lifted censorship policies.

Tunisia held elections on 23 October 2011 to create a post-revolution Constituent Assembly. Mongi Marzouk was appointed as Tunisia's Minister of Communication Technologies to the newly formed Jebali Cabinet on 20 December 2011. Marzouk's early political career demonstrated his will to maintain the provisional government's proclamation to freedom of information and expression. On 4 September 2012 at the National Forum on Internet Governance, Marzouk formally lifted Internet censorship in Tunisia and announced that Tunisia has seen the ‚Äúend of (error message) Ammar 404.‚Äù.\\"Tunisia: Information and Communication Minister - 'Internet Censorship No Longer Implemented in Tunisia'\\", Tunis Afrique Presse, 6 SEPTEMBER 2012 Two days later Tunisia attended the Freedom Online Conference in Nairobi, a platform for coalition members to further the agenda of Internet governance.

Tunisia continued its promotion of uncensored Internet at the 2012 ICT4ALL Forum on September 17‚Äì20 in Hammamet.

But in practice, it‚Äôs completely different.‚Äù.\\"Tunisia Announces Intention to End Internet Censorship\\", Lisa Goldman, 13 September 2012 In September, the United Nations appealed to Tunisia to operationalize its freedom of expression and information policies with respect to the media.

The OpenNet Initiative classified Internet filtering as pervasive in the political, social, and Internet tools areas and as selective in the conflict/security area in August 2009. This article incorporates text from this source, which carries a Creative Commons Attribution license. Ben Ali promised \\"a removal of internet restrictions\\" among several other promises in a speech shortly before he was forced out. Ammar 404 is the nickname Tunisian internet surfers use for the authority responsible for Internet censorship. In addition to filtering Web content, the government of Tunisia utilized laws, regulations, and surveillance to achieve strict control over the Internet. For example, journalists were prosecuted by Tunisia's press code, which bans offending the president, disturbing order, and publishing what the government perceives as false news. The government also restricted the media by controlling the registration of print media and licensing of broadcasters, refusing permission to critical outlets, and controlling the distribution public sector advertisement. Journalists are also charged in courts with vague violations of the penal code. Online dissidents faced severe punishment. For example, human rights lawyer Mohamed Abbou was sentenced to three and a half years in prison in 2005 publishing on a banned Web site a report in which he was accusing the government of torturing Tunisian prisoners. In a landmark legal case that challenged the Web filtering regime in the country, journalist and blogger Ziad El Hendi filed a legal suit against the Tunisian Internet Agency (ATI) for censoring social networking site Facebook. Facebook was blocked on August 18, 2008, then unblocked on September 2 at the Tunisian President's request. The Tunisian Union of Free Radio Stations and the Unionist Freedoms and Rights Observatory joined El Heni in the lawsuit and called Tunisian President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali to testify. The Third District Court of Tunisia, however, dismissed the case, in November 2008 without providing any explanation. In addition to being blocked in Tunisia, many opposition and dissident Web sites and blogs were victims of hacking attempts and in some cases, successful content removal, and shutting down of servers. Even though it was not clear who was behind these cyber attacks, many Tunisian opposition leaders believed it to be the government. For example, the independent news sites Kalima was hacked into and shut down in October 2008. The eight-year Arabic and French archives were completely destroyed. The site had been blocked since it was launched in 2000. The administrator of the site accused the government of being behind the attack because, as she told the Committee to Protect Journalists, \\"The only ones who benefit from this attack are the authorities.\\" She also said, ‚ÄúI would not rule out the possibility that this act was committed by the secret services, with the aid of hackers or pirates based in Tunisia or abroad.\\" The Web-based newsletter Tunis News and a blog run by a judge (TunisiaWatch) has been subject to similar attacks. Tunisia did not have specific laws to regulate online broadcasting. As a result, a group of journalists exploited this and launched Tunisia's first Internet radio station, Radio 6, on 10 December 2007 to mark the 59th anniversary of the World Declaration of Human Rights. Filtering during the Ben Ali regime Web filtering in Tunisia was achieved through the use of a commercial software program, SmartFilter, sold by U.S.-based company Secure Computing. Because all fixed-line Internet traffic passed through facilities controlled by ATI, the government was able to load the software onto its servers and filter content consistently across Tunisia's eleven ISPs. Tunisia purposefully hid the filtering from Internet users by displaying the standard 404 ‚ÄúFile Not Found‚Äù error message, which gives no hint that the requested site is being blocked. A transparent proxy processed every HTTP request sent out and filtered out sites based on host names. Empirical evidence showed that NetApp hardware was used to implement the controls and NetCache. The OpenNet Initiative carried out tests in Tunisia using the ISPs Planet Tunisie and TopNet. Similar to 2006-2007 test results, 2008-2009 testing revealed pervasive filtering of Web sites of political opposition groups such as: *Democratic Forum for Labor and Liberty (www.fdtl.org) *Al-Nadha Movement (www.nahdha.info) *Tunisian Workers' Communist Party (www.albadil.org) *Democratic Progressive Party (pdpinfo.org) Also blocked were Web sites run by opposition figures such as activist Moncef Marzouki and Web sites that contain oppositional news and politics such as: * www.nawaat.org *www.perspectivestunisiennes.net *www.tunisnews.com *www.tunezine.com Web sites that publish oppositional articles by Tunisian journalists were also blocked. For example, ONI verified the blocking of the French daily Lib√©ration Web site in February 2007 because of articles by Tunisian journalist Taoufik Ben Brik critical of President Zine el-Abidine Ben Ali appeared on the site. Also blocked were Web sites that criticize Tunisia's human rights record. These include the web sites of: * Amnesty International (www.amnesty.org) *Freedom House (www.freedomhouse.org) *Reporters Without Borders (www.rsf.org and www.rsf.fr) *International Freedom of Expression eXchange (www.ifex.org) *the Islamic Human Rights Commission (www.ihrc.org) *the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information (www.hrinfo.org) Although the home page of Human Rights Watch (HRW) was accessible, the Arabic and French versions of a Human Rights Watch report on Internet repression in Tunisia were blocked. The prominent video sharing Web sites youtube.com and dailymotion.com were blocked, apparently because Tunisian activists used them to disseminate content critical of the regime's human rights practices. The Web site of the OpenNet Initiative (opennet.net), which researches and documents state filtering and censorship practices, was blocked. Also blocked was the Web site of Global Voices (globalvoices.org), a non-profit global citizens‚Äô media project. Most of the tested sites in the anonymizers and circumvention tools category were also blocked. These include: * Psiphon (https://web.archive.org/web/20080101102040/http://psiphon.civisec.org/) *TOR (https://www.torproject.org/) *Anonymizer (www.anonymizer.com) *email privacy service provider Steal the Message (www.stealthmessage.com) *Guardster (www.guardster.com/) *JAP (anon.inf.tu-dresden.de) The filtering regime pervasively filtered pornographic content, several gay and lesbian information or dating pages, and several online translation services. Also blocked were a few Web sites that criticize the Quran (thequran.com) and Islam (www.islameyat.com), though the small number points to limited filtering of religious content in Tunisia. Starting in May 2010, the popular Skype VOIP application that is heavily used by Tunisian expats to stay in touch with their families went offline in Tunisia due to ATI's throttling of SIP traffic. ATI's blocking of SIP traffic has made life very difficult for call centers, whose main business is taking calls to/from French speaking Europe. Most (if not all) call centers serving Europe used SIP, often with minutes bought from European (mostly French) providers. Blocking SIP traffic resulted in many job losses in Tunisia. Surveillance during the Ben Ali regime The Tunisian authorities practiced different sorts of Internet surveillance and request that service providers such as Internet caf√©s be partners in controlling Internet use. For example, the authorities monitored Internet caf√©s, required Internet users to show IDs before they could use the Internet in some regions, and held Internet caf√© operators responsible for their clients‚Äô online activities. There was also technical surveillance where downloading or e-mail attachments went through a central server. In order to protect public order and national security, a 1998 post and telecommunications law allowed authorities to intercept and check the content of email messages. Filtering of e-mail messages of government opponents has been reported. Global Voices Advocacy Director and Tunisia Activist Sami Ben Gharbia conducted a test from the Netherlands with two Tunisia-based activists and confirmed by logging into their e-mail accounts from the Netherlands that what he saw was not what the activists saw when they logged in from Tunisia, and that they could not access all of the messages they received. In early 2011 there was increasing evidence that the private e-mail accounts of Tunisian citizens along with login details of their Facebook pages had been targeted by phishing scripts put in place by the government. There were increasing incidences of censorship in this manner as many dissidents were blocked from using the internet.

He won the marathon at the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles, becoming Portugal's first-ever Olympic gold medalist and setting an Olympic record for the event. In 1985, Lopes set the marathon world record at 2:07:12 at the Rotterdam Marathon. Early life Carlos Lopes was born in Vildemoinhos, near Viseu, Portugal. He worked as a stonecutter's helper. Lopes wanted to play football at his local club, but his father opposed this, so he turned to other forms of athletics. In 1967 he was invited to join the athletics team of Sporting Clube de Portugal, and remained there until the end of his career in 1985. Career Lopes' 1976 campaign began with a victory at the IAAF World Cross Country Championships in Chepstow, Wales. Competing in the 10,000 meters at the Montreal 1976 Summer Olympics, Lopes set the pace from the 4000m mark, and the only athlete to follow him was defending double Olympic champion Lasse Vir√©n. Vir√©n passed Lopes with a lap to go to win the gold medal, and Lopes finished a comfortable second. Lopes ran the first 5,000 metres in 14:08.94, and the second 5,000 metres in 13:36.23, a remarkable proof of his ability to steadily accelerate his pace. What he generally lacked in the track races, however, was an ability to sharply increase his pace in the final lap or so. He failed to regain his cross-country title, in D√ºsseldorf (1977), finishing second. After the superb 1976 season, Lopes slipped back into the same relative obscurity in which he had been before 1976, failing to qualify for the Moscow Olympics due to several injuries. In 1982, he returned to top form, and in Oslo, he broke the 10,000 m European record ‚Äî 27:24.39 ‚Äî which belonged to his teammate Fernando Mamede. After setting the pace from 6,000 metres to 9800 meters at the 1982 European Athletics Championships 10,000-metre race, he finished fourth in 27:47.95, behind Italy's Alberto Cova, East Germany's Werner Schildhauer, and Finland's Martti Vainio. In 1983, he finished second at the World Cross Country Championships in Gateshead. Lopes attempted his first marathon at the 1982 New York City Marathon, but he did not finish due to an accident in which he crashed into a spectator. The following year, he made his second attempt at the marathon, this time at Rotterdam. He finished a close second in a European record time of 2:08:39, just two seconds behind the race victor, Robert de Castella of Australia. Lopes decided to run the 10,000 m at the first World Championships, in Helsinki, where he finished sixth. After that he decided to concentrate on the marathon. In 1984, Lopes regained his cross-country world title in New Jersey front of thousands of ecstatic Portuguese emigrants. In Stockholm, he helped teammate Fernando Mamede to break Henry Rono's 10,000 m world record of 27:22.5, with Mamede winning in 27:13.81 and Lopes finishing second in 27:17.48. An accident almost prevented Lopes from participating in the 1984 Olympics when, a week before the Games, he was run over by a car in Lisbon. Amazingly, he was not hurt. The Olympic marathon at Los Angeles was run in very warm conditions, and as the favorites gradually fell away, it was the 37-year-old Lopes who led the field into the stadium and won the gold medal with a 200m advantage and in an Olympic record 2:09:21. With this victory, he improved his reputation as a runner, because he could run the last at an average speed of 2:55 per km (4:42 per mile), a remarkably quick pace at the end of a marathon. Portugal erupted in celebration of its first ever Olympic gold. Lopes' Olympic record stood until the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing, when Kenyan Sammy Wanjiru won with a time of 2:06:32. In 1985, Lopes won the cross-country world championship, held in his home country, for the third and final time in his career. In the last major competitive race of his career, the 1985 Rotterdam Marathon, Lopes took 53 seconds off the world's best marathon time, setting a new standard of 2:07.12, and becoming the first man to run 42.195 km in less than 2 h 8 min. * L'√âquipe: \\"Fantastic! Extraordinary! There aren't enough strong words to label Lopes Rotterdam achievement. In less than 3 years, he became the first man to approach the unreal. Who would think, 20 years ago, that a man would run the marathon at 20 km/h?\\"' * Rotterdam press: \\"With his magic talent, Carlos Lopes took 54 seconds off the previous world best. With his fabulous pace he reached the world record with apparent ease. It's said he received US$150,000 just to come to Rotterdam, plus US$67,000 in prizes. A lot of money for a single man. But, in marathon's fantasy world, only a man‚Äîaged 38‚Äîis able to run it in 2:07.12: Carlos Lopes\\". Orders *60px Grand Cross of the Order of Prince Henry Popular culture * Lopes appears in the 14th episode of season 12 of The Simpsons, as Homer is watching a documentary about the Olympics' greatest moments on TV. Lopes (whose surname is misspelled as Lopez) is credited with being the oldest ever winner of the marathon, at 38, and inspires Homer, who claims to be almost his age, to enter the Springfield Marathon. Lopes was actually 37 when he won the 1984 Olympic marathon.

Hansen is the founder, lead guitarist, and vocalist of power metal band Gamma Ray. He is also the co-founder and member of German metal band Helloween. He is a prominent figure in power metal and has sold millions of albums worldwide. He is regarded as \\"the godfather of power metal\\", having founded two seminal bands in the genre. In 2011, he joined the band Unisonic featuring former Helloween vocalist Michael Kiske. Hansen and Kiske reunited with Helloween in 2017 for a world tour with all current members, celebrating the 30-year anniversary of release of the albums Keeper of the Seven Keys Parts I and II. Early life Kai Hansen was born Hamburg, Germany in 1963. At the age of ten, Kai got interested in music and started playing wash-drums. His parents however, didn't like the noise and bought him an acoustic guitar instead. He took a six-months course in classical guitar and following it, formed his first band with his classmates after he bought an electric guitar, a white Ibanez Les Paul. Career Hansen's musical career started in 1978 in a band called Gentry, alongside Iron Savior's co-founder and producer Piet Sielck. In 1983, he and Michael Weikath founded Helloween, where he was guitarist and singer until Michael Kiske took over the microphone for the albums Keeper of the Seven Keys: Part I and Keeper of the Seven Keys: Part II. Hansen left the band due to the extensive touring in 1988‚Äì89 and went on to form his own power metal band Gamma Ray. Hansen also joined Iron Savior as guitarist in 1997, but quit after a few years to focus his efforts on Gamma Ray. He has now forged a very successful career with Gamma Ray, releasing several albums and playing sold-out tours across the globe. Hansen participated in a large number of other projects. He appeared as a guest vocalist on Blind Guardian's albums Follow the Blind and Tales from the Twilight World. Around the same time, he and fellow Gamma Ray bandmate Dirk Schl√§chter collaborated on Angra's first full-length album Angels Cry, both playing guitar solos in the song \\"Never Understand\\". He also collaborated on Angra's album Temple of Shadows released in 2004 doing vocals for the song \\"The Temple of Hate\\". With ANGRA He participated as a guest guitarist on Michael Kiske's debut solo album Instant Clarity. Together with HammerFall he recorded a cover version of Helloween's \\"I Want Out\\". Hansen played the role of Regrin the dwarf in Avantasia's Metal Opera albums by Tobias Sammet. Later he was featured in the album The Scarecrow playing guitar in the song \\"Shelter from the Rain\\". He was also one of the guest musicians in Avantasia's 2010 world tour, which have put him to play live together with fellow ex-bandmate Michael Kiske, after more than twenty years since he left Helloween. After this tour it was announced, via Michael Kiske's official website, that Hansen would join his new band Unisonic, as they \\"instantly felt the magic of Helloween years again and had a lot of fun together on and off stage\\". In 2005, he toured with the young German power/Viking metal band Stormwarrior from his home town of Hamburg as lead singer, playing material from his classic Helloween debut album Walls of Jericho ‚Äì the favorite album and greatest influence of Stormwarrior. \\"Stormwarrior featuring Kai Hansen\\" returned in 2007 to play at the Magic Circle Festival in Bad Arolsen and at the Wacken Open Air Festival. In 2008, Hansen played with Stormwarrior at Sweden Rock Festival 2008. In 2011, Hansen joined the hard-rock band Unisonic, as second guitarist and reunited with old friend and ex-Helloween vocalist Michael Kiske, who formed the band in 2009. The band released its debut album, Unisonic in 2012 and embarked on its first world tour. Hansen stated in an interview that despite being a member of Unisonic, he will not have less focus on Gamma Ray, and that the next Gamma Ray album should arrive in 2013. Unisonic's second album, Light Of Dawn, was released in 2014 and a European and Japanese tour followed. In 2015, following the Best of the Best Party Tour, Hansen hired Frank Beck as their second vocalist for the Gamma Ray. In 2016, Hansen released his first solo album titled XXX ‚Äì Three Decades in Metal. The album was released via earMUSIC on September 16 of the same year. In 2017 Kai Hansen played minitour - four shows in Slovakia and Czech republic with the band Ravenclaw, with special set for Ravenclaw 15-Years Anniversary - Ravenclaw feat. Kai Hansen. On November 14, 2016 was announced the Pumpkins United World Tour - a concert tour of the German power metal band Helloween. Both original members Michael Kiske and Kai Hansen joined the current members for this tour for 2017, 2018 and 2019. Singing style Hansen in 2007 During his earlier years Hansen's singing style was reminiscent of many thrash metal vocalists. Rather than using a smooth and clear style (like his successor Kiske) Hansen sang with a raspy sound, interluded by high-pitched screams for dramatic effect. Kiske was brought in as a singer originally because Hansen had trouble singing and playing the guitar simultaneously though later in his career he seems to have overcome these problems. Beginning from 1995 onward, Hansen has provided the vocals for his current band Gamma Ray. Around that time, Hansen's vocal style became more melodic and slightly clearer, more in the traditional power metal sense, while still retaining the slight nasal tone and rasp of his early years. Equipment For almost 20 years, Hansen has played ESP Guitars. He first started using them during his days with Helloween after hearing testimonials of ESP from artists such as George Lynch and Kirk Hammett of Metallica. Before Helloween, he had owned a white Ibanez guitar, and a Gibson Les Paul, then saved up for a Marshall amplifier by delivering newspapers. His main ESPs are red and pink ESP Custom guitars based on Jackson's Randy Rhoads model and two custom V models based on the classic Gibson Flying V shape. During the early 1990s, Hansen had used Stratocaster models. On his autobiography on the Gamma Ray website, he claims his first electric guitar was a white Ibanez Les Paul copy On the recent tour with Gamma Ray he has been seen using a Korina Epiphone flying V with EMG pickups. Hansen has used, and still uses, Engl amplifiers since the recording sessions of Keeper of the Seven Keys: Part II.

It can cause infectious bronchitis in dogs and other animals, but rarely infects humans. Closely related to B. pertussis--the obligate human pathogen that causes pertussis (whooping cough); B. bronchiseptica can persist in the environment for extended periods. Pathogenesis Humans are not natural carriers of B. bronchiseptica, which typically infects the respiratory tracts of smaller mammals (cats, dogs, rabbits, etc.). People are more likely to be infected by B. pertussis or B. parapertussis. Unlike B. pertussis, B. bronchiseptica is generally resistant to macrolide antibiotics. It is also generally resistant to cephalosporins. Some human cases have been successfully treated with trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole and fluoroquinolones. B. bronchiseptica does not express pertussis toxin, which is one of the characteristic virulence factors of B. pertussis, but it has the genes to do so, highlighting the close evolutionary relationship between the two species. Veterinary pathogenesis A scanning electron micrograph depicted a number of Gram- negative Bordetella bronchiseptica bacteria In veterinary medicine, B. bronchiseptica leads to a range of pathologies in different hosts. It is a serious disease of dogs, pigs, and rabbits, and has been seen in cats, horses, and seals. A PCR test for the pathogen exists. In pigs, B. bronchiseptica and Pasteurella multocida act synergistically to cause atrophic rhinitis, a disease resulting in arrested growth and distortion of the turbinates in the nasal terminus (snout). In dogs, B. bronchiseptica causes acute tracheobronchitis,Wagener, J. S., R. Sobonya, L. Minnich and L. M. Taussig (1984).

Kennel cough can also be caused by canine adenovirus-2 or canine parainfluenza virus or a combination of pathogens. In rabbits, B. bronchiseptica is often found in the nasal tract. It is often assumed to cause a nearly asymptomatic infection known as snuffles, but the causative agent for that disease is Pasteurella multocida; B. bronchiseptica often co-infects the nasal passage at the same time.Burns, E.

Early life Wider√∏e was born in Kristiania (now Oslo) in 1902 as a son of the mercantile agent Theodor Wider√∏e (1868‚Äì1947) and Carla Johanne Launer (1875‚Äì1971). He was a brother of the aviator and entrepreneur Viggo Wider√∏e who became the founder of the Norwegian airline Wider√∏e. After his A-level exams (Examen artium) in the summer of 1920 at the Halling School in Oslo, Wider√∏e left for Karlsruhe, Germany, to study electrical engineering. Betatron accelerator concept There he conceived the concept of electromagnetic induction to accelerate electrons, which became the basis of what would be known as betatron. This idea was to use a vortex field surrounding a magnetic field to accelerate electrons in a tube. Return to Germany In 1924, he returned to Norway for a short time period, working in a locomotive facility of Norges Statsbaner, where he fulfilled his 72-day military service. He went back to Germany in 1925. There he studied at the Technical University at Aachen, where he proposed a thesis in 1927 for an experimental betatron accelerator, incorporating the work of Swedish scientist Gustav Ising of 1924, which was not successful at first. Thus, Wider√∏e instead built a linear accelerator prototype based on Isings proposal and made this the topic of his dissertation under Walter Rogowski. In 1928, he relocated to Berlin and started building protective relays during his work at AEG. In 1932 Hitler came to power in Germany and Wider√∏e decided to return to Norway. Resonance accelerator From his betatron experiment, he developed further ideas of particle acceleration without the necessity of high voltage. The method was resonating particles with a radio frequency electric field to add energy to each traversal of the field. This experiment was successful and published in 1928, and became the progenitor of all high-energy particle accelerators. Wider√∏e's article was studied by Ernest Lawrence in the United States, and used as the basis for his creation of the cyclotron in 1929. War time In 1941 his younger brother Viggo Wider√∏e was arrested for resistance work. In 1943 the Germans \\"invited\\" Rolf Wider√∏e to Germany to continue to work on the Betatron. Inspired by the opportunity to continue his research and promises that his brother would have a better situation in his imprisonment, he agreed to go to Hamburg and start building a German Betatron. During this period, already in 1943, he introduced the theoretical concept of colliding particles head-on to increase interaction energy and a storage ring device. Several sources claims that his Norwegian citizenship was ultimately revoked for working with the Nazi government, but this is not correct. His Norwegian passport was confiscated for some time and he accepted a penalty notice of NOK 5000, loss of civil liberties and to forfeit NOK 120000 of the amount he was paid in licence fees for use of his patent rights during the betatron development. In the end, early in 1946, he received an intermediate passport and emigrated to Switzerland. Later years In 1946 he filed a patent in Norway for an accelerator based on synchronous acceleration. He would go on to publish over 180 papers in scientific and engineering journals, and filed over 200 patent applications over his lifetime. In his later life he devoted much time to medicinal technology, focusing on cancer treatment, including developing megavolt radiation therapy technologies. He would collaborate with CERN beginning in 1952 doing the preliminary studies for the Proton Synchrotron, lectured at ETH Zurich in 1953, and collaborated at DESY in 1959 in Hamburg. Rolf Wider√∏e died on 11 October 1996 in Obersiggenthal, Switzerland.

Huge, colorful graffiti-style murals were painted on the exterior walls, and modern art sculptures were featured inside. The building housed an artists collective from 1990 until 2012. Originally called Friedrichstra√üenpassage, it was built in 1907-1908 as a department store in the Jewish quarter (Scheunenviertel) of Berlin, next to the synagogue.

After the Berlin Wall had come down in 1989, it was taken over by artists, who called it Tacheles, Yiddish for \\"straight talking\\". The building contained studios and workshops, a nightclub, and a cinema. Outside, the garden featured an open-air exhibition of metal sculptures as well as galleries and studios for sculptors and painters. History=Friedrichstra√üenpassage The building was constructed over the course of 15 months in 1907 and 1908 under the watch of the imperial building office (kaiserlicher Baurat) Franz Ahrens. The building complex stretched from Friedrichstra√üe to Oranienburger Stra√üe. The shopping arcade had entrances from both sides and served to connect the two main thoroughfares. The Friedrichstra√üenpassage was the second largest of its kind in the city and the only remaining example in Europe of this type of architecture. The construction expenses totaled approximately 7 million German marks. The five-story building was made of reinforced concrete with a colossal ribbed dome. The fa√ßade was built to be dependent upon this concrete frame. There were several small businesses on both sides of the large covered arcade. The building is typically treated as an example of early Modern architecture but exhibits aspects of both Classic and Gothic styles. The complex also housed its own pneumatic tube system for sending mail and materials within the building. A group of individual shareholders hoped to establish a market advantage by capitalizing on a common location. The concept meant that stores would not be strictly separated from one another, but would instead be allowed to overlap. This was enabled by the existence of a central point-of-sale terminal, where all customers would pay for their goods. But a mere 6 months after its opening the passage had to file for bankruptcy in August 1908. The complex was then rented by Wolf Wertheim, who in 1909 opened a new department store, which operated until 1914. The building was auctioned off shortly before World War I. It is unclear how the building was used between 1914 and 1924. In 1924, among other additions to the building, a deep cellar was built. This cellar still exists today and is also known as the Tresorraum. The height of the ceiling in the passage was lowered to that of the stores, which changed the appearance of the building completely. Haus der Technik Tacheles 1997 After 1928 the building was used as a show room by the Allgemeine Elektrizit√§ts-Gesellschaft (General Electric Company). It was renamed Haus der Technik by the proprietor, the Berliner Commerz- und Privatbank. The AEG used the space to display products and advise customers. The former AEG show room, located at Luisenstra√üe 35, had been destroyed by a fire on September 15, 1927. The new space covered over 113,000 sq ft (10,500 sq. meters) and used 20 large display cases. One of the first German television transmissions took place here during the 1930s. Use by the NSDAP In the early 1930s, the building was increasingly used by the National Socialist German Workers' Party (Nazi) party members. In the mid-1930s, the German Workers Front established offices for Gau Kurmark and became owners of the building in 1941. At the same time it became the central office for the SS. In 1943 the skylights were closed and the corresponding ridge turrets removed, so that French war prisoners could be held in the attic. During the Battle of Berlin the second cellar was flooded by the Nazis and remains underwater today. The building was heavily damaged during World War II, though a large portion of it survived intact. Use in the GDR In 1948 the building was taken over by the Free German Trade Union Federation (FDGB) and deteriorated over the course of the next several years. Various retailers and craft businesses temporarily moved into the ruins, especially on the Friedrichstra√üe side. The German Travel Agency used the repaired passage section and several floors above ground. Among others, there was an artists' school, a technical school for foreign trade and economics, and office spaces for RFT (Rundfunk- und Fernmelde- Technik), a company dealing with radio and transmission technology. The cellar was used by the National People's Army. The movie theater Camera was located in the Friedrichstra√üe gateway area, but was forced to leave in 1958 due to the worsening condition of the building. The presentation hall was dismantled, but was later reopened under the name OTL (Oranienburger Tor Lichtspiele). During the reconstruction work the facade was partially changed and a lobby area was built to house cash registers and checkout aisles. The roof was also rebuilt. This created the current entryway. The movie theater is still used today as a theater area, and after further reconstruction in 1972, it was renamed Camera. Partial demolition thumbStaircase in the Tacheles Though having suffered only moderate damage during World War II, the building was slated to be demolished as a result of two engineering opinions from 1969 and 1977; it had not once been renovated, despite relatively continuous and intensive use. A new street was planned on the site and would have created a shortcut between Oranienburger Stra√üe and Friedrichstra√üe. The demolition began in 1980. The dome was torn down and the movie theater closed. The remaining portions of the building were scheduled to be demolished in April 1990. Artists' Initiative Tacheles On February 13, 1990, two months before the planned demolition, the group K√ºnstlerinitative Tacheles occupied the building. The group tried to prevent the demolition through discussions with the building management in Berlin-Mitte, which was legally responsible for the complex, by registering the building as a historic place. The planned demolition was not delayed however, until the group managed to get the Berlin Round Table to issue a last-minute injunction. The artists' initiative had a new engineering survey done to evaluate the building's structural integrity. The study found that the building was in surprisingly good shape, and it was named a historic landmark shortly thereafter. Its status was officially recognized after a second survey done in February 1992. In the beginning the center was run by well-known curator Jochen Sandig who expanded the building considerably. In its early days, Tacheles provided both housing and work space for its artist residents. In 1991, the associated housing burnt down and there was considerable suspicion that the fire was started deliberately in order to pave the way for a new art center. Among the early exhibitors were artist Mark Divo, sculptors the Mutoid Waste Company, musicians Spiral Tribe, theater group DNTT, performance artist Lennie Lee, dancer/ choreographer Sasha Waltz, RA.M.M. Theater, and many others. There was an appreciable amount of disagreement among the East German and West German artists due to their conflicting views and concepts for the space. In the meantime, however, Tacheles has become a central part of the art, activist, exhibition and communication scenes in Berlin, and is officially registered as Tacheles, e. V.. In 1996 and 1997, politicians, sociologists, architects, and artists discussed the preservation and future use of the complex at Metropolis Berlin, Hochgeschwindigkeitsarchitektur (Metropolis Berlin, High Speed Architecture). Use until 2011 One of Kunsthaus Tacheles walls. The graffiti says \\"Where is Captain Nemo?\\" Sculpture park The building was painted in bright colors and a large courtyard behind the building holds several sculptures erected using rubble, debris, vehicles and other objects. It became an art center with a cafe, cinema, performance space, workshops and exhibition space. Tacheles provided inspiration for a scene in the German film Good Bye Lenin!, according to commentary by director Wolfgang Becker on the US DVD release. A developer called the Fundus Group had bought the site from the Berlin government in the mid-1990s. Because it was in no hurry to do anything with the building, it gave the artists a 10-year lease in 1998 at a nominal rent of 1 DM (about 0.50 EUR). This contract was then extended but expired at the end of 2009, at which point the artists again became squatters. By this time, the Fundus Group had become insolvent, so the Hamburg-based HSH Nordbank, to which the Fundus Group owed money, decided to sell the property. End of Tacheles There was a division inside the Tacheles. \\"Upstairs\\" lived the artists from the coterie around organizer Martin Reiter, chairman of Tacheles e.V., the association that was formed in 1994 but went bankrupt in 2010. \\"Downstairs\\" around 20 businesses including High End Kino 54 and Caf√© Zapata, together with the Johannishof artists not represented by the e.V., formed Gruppe Tacheles. On April 4, 2011, the owner HSH Nordbank scheduled an eviction, but it was not carried out. Instead, on the next day, the downstairs group including food service establishments and the movie theater left the building peacefully in return for a payment of EUR 1 million from an anonymous source. Eighty 'upstairs' artists vowed to stay on with their ateliers and metal workshops. One week later, the sequestrator ordered an almost 3 m tall wall to be built, separating the Oranienburger Stra√üe from the building's courtyard. On September 4, 2012, the remaining 40-60 artists left peacefully, after pressure from the owner. Tacheles Metallwerkstatt, the sculpture park, was open until March 2013, when the financial group Nordbank decided to make money out of it. Several artists and programmers created a Tacheles 3D online art gallery, to open up new rooms for the Tacheles artists, and to continue the spirit of Tacheles online. The association Artprotacheles aims at expanding the idea of Tacheles through Mobile Atelier Projects and has already realised the first one in Berlin Friedrichshain. A few of the Tacheles artists have moved to a property in Marzahn.  Sale in 2014  The property was sold to a New York firm in September 2014. Lead architects for the project development after 2015 are Herzog de Meuron.

It was greeted at the time as a significant review of the post-war scene in English poetry. The introduction, written by Alvarez, is an essay called The New Poetry or Beyond the Gentility Principle. It originally appeared in a magazine called Commentary (not to be confused with the better-known New-York-based monthly of the same name) as a survey describing the state of modern poetry as Alvarez saw it. It made much play of contrasts between British/American poetry, old and then contemporary poetry, and for example Philip Larkin versus Ted Hughes. The criteria for inclusion in The New Poetry were these: the poets had to be British (which excluded Sylvia Plath from the first edition); they needed to have been young enough to have made their reputations only after 1950 (this excluded the likes of W. H. Auden and Louis MacNeice); and they had to appeal to Alvarez himself. There were two exceptions to the first and second of these guidelines: Alvarez included long well-established Americans, Robert Lowell and John Berryman, at the start of the anthology. Alvarez concluded that Lowell and Berryman were the most influential figures on British poetry writing at that time, which justified their inclusion. Each poet was represented with a minimum of five poems. In the revised edition (1966) Alvarez relaxed these rules somewhat to allow Plath and yet another American poet, Anne Sexton, to be represented. In some senses the anthology can be seen as a reaction to Robert Conquest's New Lines anthology, which appeared a decade before. The anthology included a very brief biographical note on each of the poets. The revised edition included three poems by Sylvia Plath that were previously unpublished.

Belpaire was born in Ostend, and first studied at the Athenaeum School in Antwerp. He then became a student at the √âcole Centrale des Arts et Manufactures in Paris, France from 1837 to 1840 where he obtained a degree in mechanical engineering. Belpaire was then employed at the Belgian State Railways, where he worked as a mechanical engineer for more than 50 years. He was first director of the railway workshops at Mechelen and then from 1850 put in charge of all materials and based in Brussels. He first developed a firebox to burn poor quality coals and then around 1860 generalised his invention into a robust thermally efficient design which bears his name. His firebox was used in locomotives in his native Belgium and also then extensively in Britain, North America and around the world. The Belpaire firebox had an improved transfer of heat and steam production due to its greater surface area at the top. While attaching it to a boiler was more difficult due to its oblong shape, it had simpler interior bracing as an advantage.

In modern times it is used more broadly as a symbol of the county of Yorkshire. History The white rose was first adopted as a heraldic badge by Edmund of Langley, 1st Duke of York (1341-1402), the fourth surviving son of King Edward III of England. One of his elder brothers, John of Gaunt, 1st Duke of Lancaster (1340-1399) adopted a red rose as a heraldic badge, the red rose of Lancaster. Their respective descendants fought for control of the throne of England during several decades of civil warfare, which became known as the Wars of the Roses, after the badges of the two competing cadet royal houses. The symbolism of the white rose has religious connotations as (like the white lily) it represents the purity of the Virgin Mary, one of whose many titles in the Roman Catholic faith is the Mystical Rose of Heaven. In Christian liturgical iconography white is the symbol of light, typifying innocence, purity, joy and glory. During the civil wars of the fifteenth century the White Rose was the symbol of Yorkist forces opposed to the rival House of Lancaster which adopted the Red Rose of Lancaster. The opposition of the two roses gave the wars their name: the Wars of the Roses, coined in the 19th century. The conflict was ended by King Henry VII of England who, being descended from both royal houses, symbolically united the White and Red Roses to create the Tudor Rose, the symbol of the Tudor dynasty. In the late 17th century the Jacobites took up the White Rose of York as their emblem, celebrating \\"White Rose Day\\" on 10 June, the anniversary of the birth of The Old Pretender in 1688. At the Battle of Minden in Prussia on 1 August 1759, Yorkshiremen of the 51st Regiment (predecessor of the King's Own Yorkshire Light Infantry) picked white roses from bushes near to the battlefields and stuck them in their coats as a tribute to their fallen comrades. Yorkshire Day is held on this date each year. When in 2015 the body of the last Yorkist King Richard III (killed by the forces of the future King Henry VII at the Battle of Bosworth in 1485) was re-discovered buried in the City of Leicester, it was re-interred in Leicester Cathedral on 26 March 2015 with a white rose engraved on the new coffin, which was made by Michael Ibsen, a distant relative of the king, whose DNA helped to prove his identity. Use in Yorkshire heraldry Flag of Yorkshire The flag of Yorkshire is a White Rose on a blue background. The flags of the three ridings also display it prominently. More than 20 civic entities in Yorkshire have a coat of arms which includes the rose of York. In heraldry The Rose of York is blazoned as A rose argent barbed and seeded proper (a white rose with sepals and seeds in their natural colours). According to the College of Heralds, the heraldic rose may be used with either a petal at the top or if slightly rotated with a sepal at the top. Traditionally the rose is displayed with a petal at the top in the North Riding and West Riding but with a sepal at the top in the East Riding of Yorkshire. International uses The Yorkist rose is used in the seal of the City of York, Pennsylvania, which is known as \\"White Rose City\\". The town's minor league baseball team, which played in different leagues for several decades, was called the York White Roses. A 2016 \\"York Revolution War of the Roses\\" hat worn by Michael Rockett The white rose appears on one of the hats for York's current minor league baseball team, the York Revolution. The hats are worn during War of the Roses games versus the Red Rose City, the Lancaster Barnstormers. The York Rose features on the shield of Canada's York University. The York Rose also features in the emblem of Lenana School, a tier-one High School in Nairobi, Kenya. Lenana School was formerly known as Duke of York School. Queens County, New York uses the white and red rose on the county flag and was named after Catherine of Braganza, spouse of King Charles II who in 1664 sent a fleet to recapture New Amsterdam from the Dutch and which became renamed as \\"New York\\" after James, Duke of York, younger brother of King Charles II who succeeded him as King James II.

Such theories have been used to describe many referring terms, particularly logical terms, proper names, and natural kind terms. In the case of names, for example, a causal theory of reference typically involves the following claims: * a name's referent is fixed by an original act of naming (also called a \\"dubbing\\" or, by Saul Kripke, an \\"initial baptism\\"), whereupon the name becomes a rigid designator of that object. * later uses of the name succeed in referring to the referent by being linked to that original act via a causal chain. Weaker versions of the position (perhaps not properly called \\"causal theories\\"), claim merely that, in many cases, events in the causal history of a speaker's use of the term, including when the term was first acquired, must be considered to correctly assign references to the speaker's words. Causal theories of names became popular during the 1970s, under the influence of work by Saul Kripke and Keith Donnellan. Kripke and Hilary Putnam also defended an analogous causal account of natural kind terms.  Kripke's causal account of names  In lectures later published as Naming and Necessity, Kripke provided a rough outline of his causal theory of reference for names. Although he refused to explicitly endorse such a theory, he indicated that such an approach was far more promising than the then-popular descriptive theory of names introduced by Russell, according to which names are in fact disguised definite descriptions. Kripke argued that in order to use a name successfully to refer to something, you do not have to be acquainted with a uniquely identifying description of that thing. Rather, your use of the name need only be caused (in an appropriate way) by the naming of that thing. Such a causal process might proceed as follows: the parents of a newborn baby name it, pointing to the child and saying \\"we'll call her 'Jane'.\\" Henceforth everyone calls her 'Jane'. With that act, the parents give the girl her name. The assembled family and friends now know that 'Jane' is a name which refers to Jane. This is referred to as Jane's dubbing, naming, or initial baptism. However, not everyone who knows Jane and uses the name 'Jane' to refer to her was present at this naming. So how is it that when they use the name 'Jane', they are referring to Jane? The answer provided by causal theories is that there is a causal chain that passes from the original observers of Jane's naming to everyone else who uses her name. For example, maybe Jill was not at the naming, but Jill learns about Jane, and learns that her name is 'Jane', from Jane's mother, who was there. She then uses the name 'Jane' with the intention of referring to the child Jane's mother referred to. Jill can now use the name, and her use of it can in turn transmit the ability to refer to Jane to other speakers. Philosophers such as Gareth Evans have insisted that the theory's account of the dubbing process needs to be broadened to include what are called 'multiple groundings'. After her initial baptism, uses of 'Jane' in the presence of Jane may, under the right circumstances, be considered to further ground the name ('Jane') in its referent (Jane). That is, if I am in direct contact with Jane, the reference for my utterance of the name 'Jane' may be fixed not simply by a causal chain through people who had encountered her earlier (when she was first named); it may also be indexically fixed to Jane at the moment of my utterance. Thus our modern day use of a name such as 'Christopher Columbus' can be thought of as referring to Columbus through a causal chain that terminates not simply in one instance of his naming, but rather in a series of grounding uses of the name that occurred throughout his life. Under certain circumstances of confusion, this can lead to the alteration of a name's referent (for one example of how this might happen, see Twin Earth thought experiment).  Motivation  Causal theories of reference were born partially in response to the widespread acceptance of Russellian descriptive theories. Russell found that certain logical contradictions could be avoided if names were considered disguised definite descriptions (a similar view is often attributed to Gottlob Frege, mostly on the strength of a footnoted comment in \\"On Sense and Reference\\", although many Frege scholars consider this attribution misguided). On such an account, the name 'Aristotle' might be seen as meaning 'the student of Plato and teacher of Alexander the Great'. Later description theorists expanded upon this by suggesting that a name expressed not one particular description, but many (perhaps constituting all of one's essential knowledge of the individual named), or a weighted average of these descriptions. Kripke found this account to be deeply flawed, for a number of reasons. Notably: * We can successfully refer to individuals for whom we have no uniquely identifying description. (For example, a speaker can talk about Phillie Sophik even if one only knows him as 'some poet'.) * We can successfully refer to individuals for whom the only identifying descriptions we have fail to refer as we believe them to. (Many speakers have no identifying beliefs about Christopher Columbus other than 'the first European in North America' or 'the first person to believe that the earth was round'. Both of these beliefs are incorrect. Nevertheless, when such a person says 'Christopher Columbus', we acknowledge that they are referring to Christopher Columbus, not to whatever individual satisfies one of those descriptions.) * We use names to speak hypothetically about what could have happened to a person. A name functions as a rigid designator, while a definite description does not. (One could say 'If Aristotle had died young, he would never have taught Alexander the Great.' But if 'the teacher of Alexander the Great' were a component of the meaning of 'Aristotle' then this would be nonsense.) A causal theory avoids these difficulties. A name refers rigidly to the bearer to which it is causally connected, regardless of any particular facts about the bearer, and in all possible worlds. The same motivations apply to causal theories in regard to other sorts of terms. Putnam, for instance, attempted to establish that 'water' refers rigidly to the stuff that we do in fact call 'water', to the exclusion of any possible identical water-like substance for which we have no causal connection. These considerations motivate semantic externalism. Because speakers interact with a natural kind such as water regularly, and because there is generally no naming ceremony through which their names are formalized, the multiple groundings described above are even more essential to a causal account of such terms. A speaker whose environment changes may thus observe that the referents of his terms shift, as described in the Twin Earth and Swampman thought experiments.  Variations  Variations of the causal theory include: * The causal-historical theory of reference is the original version of the causal theory. It was put forward by Keith Donnellan in 1972Donnellan, Keith. (1972). \\"Proper Names and Identifying Descriptions.\\" In Donald Davidson; Gilbert Harman (eds.). Semantics of Natural Language.

Lewis (1999), Papers on metaphysics and epistemology, Cambridge University Press, pp. 56‚Äì77. introduces the idea that a minimal descriptive apparatus needs to be added to the causal relations between speaker and object. (See also Criticism of structuralism.)  Criticism of the theory  Gareth Evans argued that the causal theory, or at least certain common and over-simple variants of it, have the consequence that, however remote or obscure the causal connection between someone's use of a proper name and the object it originally referred to, they still refer to that object when they use the name. (Imagine a name briefly overheard in a train or caf√©.) The theory effectively ignores context and makes reference into a magic trick. Evans describes it as a \\"photograph\\" theory of reference. The links between different users of the name are particularly obscure. Each user must somehow pass the name on to the next, and must somehow \\"mean\\" the right individual as they do so (suppose \\"Socrates\\" is the name of a pet aardvark). Kripke himself notes the difficulty, John Searle makes much of it. Mark Sainsbury arguedSainsbury, R.M., Departing From Frege: Essays in the Philosophy of Language, Routledge, 2002, Essay XII. for a causal theory similar to Kripke's, except that the baptised object is eliminated. A \\"baptism\\" may be a baptism of nothing, he argues: a name can be intelligibly introduced even if it names nothing. The causal chain we associate with the use of proper names may begin merely with a \\"journalistic\\" source. The causal theory has a difficult time explaining the phenomenon of reference change. Gareth Evans cites the example of when Marco Polo unknowingly referred to the African Island as \\"Madagascar\\" when the natives actually used the term to refer to a part of the mainland. Evans claims that Polo clearly intended to use the term as the natives do, but somehow changed the meaning of the term \\"Madagascar\\" to refer to the island as it is known today. Michael Devitt claims that repeated groundings in an object can account for reference change. However, such a response leaves open the problem of cognitive significance that originally intrigued Russell and Frege.

Roman forces occupied this region, in order to pacify its population, as part of its occupation from the Pyrenees to the Atlantic, Canterbury to the Mediterranean. They forced a restructuring of society, promoting the occupation of the open plains rather than the hilltops, which were typical at the time. The difficulty encountered by the Romans in this area, resulted in the Greek historian Strabo identifying the Lusitanian region and its peoples as the most powerful groups in the Iberian peninsula. On Monte Padr√£o existed the ruins of a castro. The Castro of Monte Padr√£o, until the end of the 16th century, existed as the parochial church, being under the primitive monastery of Celanova, in Galicia. Geography The civil parish of Monte C√≥rdova is situated 30 kilometres from Porto, and accessible by the EN105 motorway to many of the local communities, including Braga, Famalic√£o and Guimar√£es. For many centuries, the geomorphology of the terrain was responsible for the relative isolation of its populations. The parish is located at about 410‚Äì420 metres above sea level, in an area called the Agrela da Assun√ß√£o escarpment. Alto de Cabanas is one of the best natural lookouts in the region, and the area of Valinhas, with its monumental oak forests and curious chapel, near the Ferven√ßa waterfalls (or the Le√ßa River), are almost obligatory natural sites of the landscape. Economy For a long time Monte C√≥rdova was considered the \\"breadbasket\\" of Santo Tirso (). However, primary activities have diminished considerably over time so that the totality of the lands cultivated today only provide subsistence resources for the local community, or to complement family income. The secondary economic activities are dominated by industries such as sawmilling, carpentry and associated services. Architecture The parish of Monte C√≥rdova has many cultural monuments and buildings spread throughout its territory, but the following have been classified in the National Registry of Patrimony by IGESPAR: Civic * Castro of Monte Padr√£o () * Monte C√≥rdova Primary School () * Pereiras' Sierra Hydraulic Building () Religious * Chapel of S√£o Gon√ßalo () * Church of Nossa Senhora da Assun√ß√£o () - designed by the Italian architect Korrrodi, the basilica-like church houses the image of Nossa Senhora da Assun√ß√£o (Our Lady of the Assumption), considered one of the best conserved sculptures from the late 19th century sculptor Jo√£o da Fonseca Lapa.

Royal Albert Memorial Museum, Exeter. Francis Hayman (1708 ‚Äì 2 February 1776) was an English painter and illustrator who became one of the founding members of the Royal Academy in 1768, and later its first librarian. Born in Exeter, Devon, Hayman begun his artistic career as a scene painter in London's Drury Lane theatre (where he also appeared in minor roles) before establishing a studio in St Martin's Lane. A versatile artist influenced by the French Rococo style, he achieved some note during the 1740s through decorative paintings executed for the supper boxes at Vauxhall Pleasure Gardens in London. Hayman was also a successful portraitist and history painter. Combining some of these, he contributed 31 pictures to a 1744 edition of Shakespeare's plays by Sir Thomas Hanmer, and later portrayed many leading contemporary actors in Shakespearean roles, including David Garrick as Richard III (1760). He also illustrated Pamela, a novel by Samuel Richardson, Milton's Paradise Lost and Paradise Regained, Tobias Smollett's translation of Don Quixote, and other well-known works. In the 1760s Hayman was commissioned by Jonathan Tyers, proprietor of Vauxhall Gardens and the Denbies estate, to paint a series of large-scale history paintings depicting British victories in the Seven Years' War. He was an able teacher. His pupils included Mason Chamberlin, Nathaniel Dance-Holland, Thomas Seton and Lemuel Francis Abbott, and he was also a strong influence on Thomas Gainsborough. With Joshua Reynolds, Hayman was actively involved in the formation of the Society of Artists, a forerunner of the Royal Academy, during the early 1760s. Hayman died in 1776 and was buried in an unmarked grave in St Anne's Church, Soho.Peter Matthews, Who's Buried Where in London, p.33.

Their musical style has varied considerably over the years, as has their line- up with the core of Henk Hofstede (the group's lead singer and lyricist), Rob Kloet, drummer, and Robert Jan Stips (Supersister, Gruppo Sportivo, Golden Earring), keyboards. Their biggest hit in the Netherlands was \\"Nescio\\" (1983), a tribute to the Dutch author Jan Hendrik Frederik Gr√∂nloh. The major hit that brought the band to the attention of an international audience was \\"In the Dutch Mountains\\" (1987). Other well-known Nits songs include \\"J.O.S. Days\\", \\"Adieu, Sweet Bahnhof\\" and \\"Sketches of Spain\\". Top 10 albums include Omsk (1983), In the Dutch Mountains (1987), Urk (1989), Doing the Dishes (2008) and Hotel Europa (2015). Early history Henk Hofstede Robert Jan Stips Rob Kloet The Nits originally consisted of Henk Hofstede (vocals, guitar), Alex Roelofs (bass), Michiel Peters (guitar) and Rob Kloet (drums). Influenced by British pop music, especially the Beatles, they also incorporated influences from new wave music into their sound. They made their live debut in 1974, and released their self-financed, limited-run debut LP, The Nits, in 1978. This brought them to the attention of Columbia Records, for whom The Nits would continue to record for the next 22 years. Their major-label debut, Tent (1979), carried on the new wave style of The Nits, but was considerably more polished, partly due to the influence of producer Robert Jan Stips. On New Flat (1980) and Work (1981), which made increasing use of synthesisers, \\"Hofstede reveals a growing aptitude for creating little emotional postcards.\\" > \\"The obvious derivativeness on the Nits' early albums could have been > written off as cut-rate local flirtation/reassembly of the real thing from > Britain and America (Beatles, Talking Heads, etc.). In retrospect, however, > those records could be seen as learning experiences of a world-class band > now deserving international attention.\\" Omsk & Adieu, Sweet Bahnhof In the meantime, the group had been developing their sound on their numerous European tours. Many songs were radically reworked for live performance, a practice the group would continue throughout their career. Between the group's experiments with different arrangements, and the addition of Stips to the line-up, The Nits gradually moved toward a more distinctive musical style, with Kloet playing a wide range of percussion, and Stips' keyboards used to produce a lusher sound. Omsk showcased the new Nits sound with songs like \\"A Touch of Henry Moore\\", almost entirely based around Kloet's percussion, and the dramatic hit single \\"Nescio\\". The follow-up \\"Adieu, Sweet Bahnhof\\" was another hit, but tensions between the group and producer Jaap Eggermont led to the departure of Peters, and a change in the group's working methods. In future, they would produce their own material and bring in guest musicians as required. Henk, In the Dutch Mountains & Urk The album Henk - which included such classic songs as Bike In Head, Home Before Dark and Port Of Amsterdam - was recorded as a three-piece, after which new bassist Joke Geraets became the first female member of The Nits, completing the line-up that would go on to enjoy commercial success with single and album In the Dutch Mountains (1987). Its title track became a European hit and one of the band's biggest. It was accompanied by a video with just the image of man in a rowing boat. Follow-up J.O.S. Days was a successful single as well. The group's extensive tours during this period led to the accomplished live triple-LP Urk (1989) which became their best-selling album. The live version of Adieu Sweet Bahnhof was released as a single, again accompanied by a video. It became a Top 30 hit for the band in Holland. Urk also featured live versions of songs from Hat, the band's 1988 6-song EP, including popular songs like The Dream, Bauhaus Chair and The Train. Giant Normal Dwarf, Ting & Hjuvi When Geraets fell ill with a muscular disease, meaning that she was unable to play bass, the group (now using the shortened name \\"Nits\\", often rendered in capitals to emphasise the absence of the definite article) continued as a trio. Giant Normal Dwarf (1990) was a kaleidoscopic affair which at first glance seemed like a return to the psychedelia of \\"I Am the Walrus\\" and \\"Glass Onion\\" but was actually inspired by Hofstede's desire to write musical fairy tales for his newborn child. The subsequent album Ting (1992) was a return to a much more minimalist approach, both with respect to the emphasis on the piano and the inspiration of Philip Glass on several songs. At the same time as working on Ting, the group were also preparing material for a TV special with the Netherlands Radio Symphony Orchestra. Mainly composed by Stips, this was later issued as the album Hjuvi - A Rhapsody In Time. dA dA dA, Nest & Vest The 1994 album dA dA dA was something of a return to basics, with \\"traditional\\" songwriting largely replacing the quirkiness of recent Nits releases, and the group's early influences once again to the fore. The album was the first Nits material to gain a release in the United States. Ironically for a group that had always performed in English, regarding it as a necessary evil for international success, recognition in the major English-speaking markets always eluded them. dA dA dA, despite critical acclaim in both the UK and USA, still failed to break the group in either market. In 1995, the group released Nest, a 20-track retrospective album, and the accompanying tour ended on a high note with a concert broadcast live on television from the Uitmarkt festival. Stips then left to pursue a solo career. A one-hour VHS video compilation Vest, 16 video clips, 1984‚Äì1995 was also released, featuring short films to accompany the songs, filmed on a low budget by the band themselves, with a 16mm cine camera. Alankomaat, Wool & 1974 The group continued, releasing the introspective albums Alankomaat (1998) - which featured the singles Sister Rosa and Robinson, and fan favourite Three Sisters - and Wool (2000), followed by another retrospective, Hits. The group continues to perform to this day following the return of keyboard player Robert Jan Stips in 2003 for the release of the album 1974, commemorating the year of their formation. Les Nuits, Doing the Dishes & Strawberry Wood A new album titled Les Nuits was released in October 2005. Three of the songs on the album - The Laundrette, The Key Shop and The Pizzeria - were about the murder of film director Theo Van Gogh, which happened in the street where Henk Hofstede lived. The title track of the album would pop up on the band's setlists for many years to come. After an extensive tour and some solo activity, the band returned to the studio in mid-2007 to record the album Doing the Dishes, released in January 2008. The album went top 10 in the Netherlands (for the first time since URK in 1989), had an airplay hit in The Flowers and was once again followed by a tour. Many of the album's songs were performed live. In 2009, the next album and tour, Strawberry Wood, a top 15 hit on the Dutch album chart, followed. It was preceded by the single Hawelka. Malpensa, NITS? & Hotel Europa In early 2012, the Nits released the album Malpensa, to positive reviews and fan reactions. It contains a collaboration with Colin Benders of Kyteman on the track \\"Bad Government\\". The songs \\"Love-Locks\\" and \\"Man on a Wire\\" were released as singles, as well as \\"Bad Government\\", which was re-done with Perquisite and Dazzled Kid for the single remix. The song \\"Schwebebahn\\" finds the band singing in German for the first time. In 2013, the Nits composed and produced the music of the documentary The King of Mount Ventoux by director Fons Feyaerts. The 7-track soundtrack was released on iTunes and Spotify. 2014 and 2015 focused on the '40 years of NITS' anniversary. A 3CD compilation album spanning the band's whole career was released in 2014, which contained three unreleased tracks. In March 2015, the band released Hotel Europa, a double live album with songs ranging from Giant Normal Dwarf (1990) to Malpensa (2012), with exception of a live version of \\"In the Dutch Mountains\\". The album received rave reviews and entered the Dutch album charts at #5, making it their highest charting album since Urk (#3, 1989) and their first Top 10 album since Doing the Dishes (#8, 2008). In November 2015, all Nits albums were released on digital platforms such as Spotify, Deezer and Apple Music. TING! with Scapino Ballet, angst and Knot  In 2016 the band played 20 shows with Scapino Ballet Rotterdam. The show, entitled TING!, featured 20 NITS songs including \\"Nescio\\", \\"Five Fingers\\", \\"The Long Song\\", \\"The Swimmers\\" and \\"In the Dutch Mountains\\". More than 20,000 people saw the show in Rotterdam. In August 2017 new album and tour angst were announced for September. Preceded by the songs \\"Flowershop Forget-Me-Not\\", \\"Yellow Socks & Angst\\" and \\"Pockets Of Rain\\". On Friday September 15 \\"Yellow Socks & Angst\\" was added to Spotify's popular New Music Friday playlist. angst was released by the band's own WERF Records and largely sold through the band's own website. Despite this, on the back of very good reviews in OOR, Algemeen Dagblad and Lust For Life a.o., and promo shows on Dutch Radio, it entered the Dutch Album Top 100 at #40. The European 2017-2018 tour started in September 2017. Early November 2017 a 12-second promo for the tour was broadcast on Dutch TV, featuring \\"Port Of Amsterdam\\", from the albums Henk (1986) and URK (1989, live). Late November the band played \\"Radio Orange\\" on Holland's biggest TV show De Wereld Draait Door, after which angst returned to the iTunes Top 15. Early December NITS played the same song on Belgian TV show \\"De Zevende Dag\\". In January 2018 Spotify released the playlist This is: NITS featuring 40 songs from Tent (1979) all the way up to angst (2017). From Tutti Ragazzi to In The Dutch Mountains and from Giant Normal Dwarf to Pockets Of Rain. On November 22, 2019 Knot was released to favourable reviews in OOR, Parool and Written in Music a.o.

The official Nits website includes a map showing the locations that the group has written songs about. Another common theme (to some extent overlapping the first) is songs inspired by works of art, literature and museum exhibits (e.g. \\"A Touch of Henry Moore\\", \\"Soap Bubble Box\\", \\"Nescio\\"). Many other songs are impressionistic, and many are concerned with the passing of time. Some albums include clusters of songs on a particular subject, for example In the Dutch Mountains contains several songs about Hofstede's childhood memories, Giant Normal Dwarf includes several fantasy songs set in a folkloric version of the Netherlands called Fountainland, and the later albums, particularly Les Nuits, include numerous songs on the subject of human mortality.

Dogfish sailed out of New London, Connecticut, on local duties and cruised to the Caribbean Sea and Bermuda to conduct training. She was overhauled and extensively modernized at the Philadelphia Naval Shipyard from August 1947 to April 1948, and then served in experimental projects as well as normal operations at New London. From 31 October to 19 November 1948 she took part in large-scale fleet exercises ranging from the waters off Florida to Davis Strait between Labrador and Greenland. She cruised to Scotland, England, and France between 4 February and 3 April 1949 and joined in a convoy exercise off Cape Hatteras in February and March 1952, and operated along the east coast and in the Caribbean Sea during the next three years. Dogfish sailed from New London on 1 March 1955 for her first tour with the Sixth Fleet in the Mediterranean Sea, returning to her home port 6 June. The submarine called at Halifax, Nova Scotia, from 4 June to 14 June 1956 during NATO Operation New Broom. On 8 November, she stood by and fought the fires on the trawler Agda during local operations out of New London. She cruised to Faslane Bay in Scotland between 31 January and 12 April 1958 to evaluate new equipment, and from 23 May to 8 August 1959 served in the Mediterranean Sea. In October and November, she took part in NATO antisubmarine warfare exercises. After extensive overhaul, the vessel resumed local operations from New London through 1960. Transfer to Brazil Dogfish was stricken from the Naval Vessel Register and sold to Brazil on 28 July 1972. She served the Brazilian Navy as Guanabara (S-10) until being deleted in 1983.

Reconstructed European wooden keep at Saint- Sylvain-d'Anjou, France, has a strong resemblance to a North American western frontier log blockhouse A blockhouse in military science is a small fortification, usually consisting of one or more rooms with loopholes, allowing its defenders to fire in various directions. It usually refers to an isolated fort in the form of a single building, serving as a defensive strong point against any enemy that does not possess siege equipment or, in modern times, artillery, air force and cruise missiles. A fortification intended to resist these weapons is more likely to qualify as a fortress or a redoubt, or in modern times, be an underground bunker. However, a blockhouse may also refer to a room within a larger fortification, usually a battery or redoubt. Etymology The term blockhouse is of uncertain origin, perhaps related to Middle Dutch blokhus and 18th-century French blocus (blockade).  In ancient Greece  Blockhouses existed in ancient Greece, for example the one near Mycenae.  Early blockhouses in England  Henrican blockhouse at Mount Edgcumbe near Plymouth, Devon, which is believed to date from circa 1545 Early blockhouses were designed solely to protect a particular area by the use of artillery, and they had accommodation only for the short-term use of the garrison. The first known example is the Cow Tower, Norwich, built in 1398, which was of brick and had three storeys with the upper storeys pierced for six guns each. The major period of construction was in the maritime defence programmes of Henry VIII between 1539 and 1545. They were built to protect important maritime approaches such as the Thames Estuary, the Solent, and Plymouth. Often sited in pairs, the blockhouses were not built to a common design, but usually consisted of a stone tower and bastion or gun platform, which could be semi-circular, rectangular or irregular in shape. The last blockhouse of this type was Cromwell's Castle, built in Scilly in 1651.  Coastal fortifications in Malta  Blockhouse of Westreme Battery, built in 1715‚Äì16 in Mellieƒßa, Malta Blockhouses were an ubiquitous feature in Malta's coastal fortifications built in the 18th century by the Order of St. John. Between 1714 and 1716, dozens of batteries and redoubts were built around the coasts of the Maltese Islands, while a few others were built in the subsequent decades. Almost every battery and redoubt had a blockhouse, which served as gun crew accommodation and a place to store munitions. Many of the batteries consisted of a semi-circular or polygonal gun platform, with one or two blockhouses at the rear. The blockhouses usually had musketry loopholes, and in some cases were linked together by redans. Surviving batteries include Mistra Battery and Ferretti Battery, which both have two blockhouses, and Saint Mary's Battery and Saint Anthony's Battery, which have a single blockhouse. Many of the redoubts consisted of a pentagonal platform with a rectangular blockhouse at the rear, although a few had semi-circular or rectangular platforms. Surviving redoubts with blockhouses include Baƒßar iƒã- ƒäagƒßaq Redoubt and Briconet Redoubt, both of which have a pentagonal plan. A few of the redoubts consisted of a single tower-like blockhouse without a platform, and were known as tour-reduits. Of the four tour-reduits that were built, only the Vend√¥me Tower survives today.  Age of exploration  Originally blockhouses were often constructed as part of a large plan, to \\"block\\" access to vital points in the scheme. But from the Age of Exploration to the nineteenth century standard patterns of blockhouses were constructed for defence in frontier areas, particularly South Africa, New Zealand, Canada, and the United States. Blockhouses may be made of masonry where available, but were commonly made from very heavy timbers, sometimes even logs arranged in the manner of a log cabin. They were usually two or even three floors, with all storeys being provided with embrasures or loopholes, and the uppermost storey would be roofed. If the structure was of timber, usually the upper storey would project outward from the lower so the upper storey defenders could fire on enemies attacking the lower storey, or perhaps pour water on any fires. When the structure had only one storey, its loopholes were often placed close to the ceiling, with a bench lining the walls inside for defenders to stand on, so that attackers could not easily reach the loopholes. A 19th- century-era block house in Fort York, Toronto Blockhouses were normally entered via a sturdy, barred door at ground level. Most blockhouses were roughly square in plan, but some of the more elaborate ones were hexagonal or octagonal, to provide better all-around fire. In some cases, blockhouses became the basis for complete forts, by building a palisade with the blockhouse at one corner, and possibly a second tower at the opposite corner. Many historical stone blockhouses have survived, and a few timber ones have been restored at historical sites. In New Zealand, the Cameron Blockhouse, near Whanganui, is one of the few blockhouses to survive from the New Zealand Wars.  Second Boer War  Sentinel Blockhouse in Burgersdorp During the Second Boer War the British forces built a large number of fortifications in South Africa. Around 441 were solid masonry blockhouses, many of which stand today. Different designs were used in the construction of these blockhouses, but most were either two or three story structures built using locally quarried stone. However the vast scale of British strategy led the British to develop cheaper, double-skinned corrugated iron structures. These could be prefabricated, delivered to site by armoured train, and then have locally sourced rocks or rubble packed inside the double skin to provide improved protection. A circular design developed by Major Rice in February 1901 had good all round visibility, and the lack of corners did away with the need for a substructure. Failure due to wood rot and splintering when hit by bullets or shrapnel were eliminated. The steel door to the blockhouse was sheltered by another piece of corrugated iron. The Major Rice blockhouse could be erected in six hours by six trained men. With the change from square gabled roofs to a circular design, they were given the nickname \\"Pepperpot blockhouse\\". With mass production the cost to build a blockhouse dropped down to ¬£16, compared to several hundred pounds for masonry ones. These blockhouses played a vital role in the protection of the railway lines and bridges that were key to the British military supply lines.  Concrete blockhouses  During World War I and World War II, many types of blockhouses were built, when time allowed usually constructed of reinforced concrete. The major difference between a modern blockhouse and a bunker is that a bunker is constructed mostly below ground level while a blockhouse is constructed mostly above ground level.For the difference between blockhouses and bunkers see , , The Admiralty Citadel in 2008 Some blockhouses like those constructed in England in 1940 were built in anticipation of a German invasion, they were often hexagonal in shape and were called \\"pillboxes\\". About 28,000 pillboxes and other hardened field fortifications were constructed of which about 6,500 still survive. Flakturm (anti-aircraft tower) in the Augarten Vienna, Austria In London the Admiralty Citadel is one of the sturdiest above-ground structures built during World War II. It was constructed in 1940‚Äì1941 as a bomb-proof operations centre for the Admiralty, with foundations nine metres deep and a concrete roof six metres thick. It too was intended to serve as a strongpoint in defending against the feared invasion. In Berlin and other cities during World War II some massive blockhouses were built as air-raid shelters and anti- aircraft artillery platforms. They were called Hochbunker (literally, \\"high bunkers\\"; better translated as \\"above ground bunkers\\", to distinguish them from the usual deep i.e. underground air raid shelters) and those that functioned as anti-aircraft artillery platforms were also called Flak towers. Some were over six stories high; several survive to this day because of the high cost of demolition. The in Berlin-Sch√∂neberg has a post-war block of flats built over it. During the Cold War the shelter was in use as a NATO foodstore. In the Guerrilla phase of the Irish Civil War (1922‚Äì1923), a network of blockhouses was constructed to protect the railways from guerrilla attacks.

Engine dimensions (Comotor units): length 16.22 in. (412 mm); width 13.5 in. (340 mm), height 13.5 in. (340 mm), weight 223 pounds (101 kg). Power at 6,500 rpm; torque at 3,000 rpm (all figures approximate). The Ro 80 was voted Car of the Year for 19681968 NSU Ro 80 at caroftheyear.org Accessed 29 January 2018 and 37,398 units were manufactured over a ten-year production run, all in a single generation.  Running gear  Other technological features of the Ro 80, aside from the powertrain, were the four wheel ATE Dunlop disc brakes, which were generally only featured on expensive sports or luxury saloon cars. The front brakes were mounted inboard, reducing the unsprung weight. The suspension was independent on all four wheels, with MacPherson struts at the front and semi-trailing arm suspension at the rear, both of which are space-saving designs commonly used today. Power assisted ZF rack and pinion steering was used, again foreshadowing more recent designs.  Transmission  The car featured an automatic clutch which was commonly described as a three-speed semi-automatic gearbox: there was no clutch pedal, but instead, touching the gear lever knob operated an internal electric switch that operated a vacuum system which disengaged the clutch. The gear lever itself then could be moved through a standard \\"H pattern\\" gate.  Styling  The styling, by Claus Luthe who was head of design at NSU and later BMW, was considered very modern at the time; the Ro 80 has been part of many gallery exhibits of modern industrial design. The large glass area foreshadowed 1970s designs such as Citro√´n's. The shape was also slippery, with a drag coefficient of 0.355 (very low for the era). This allowed for a top speed of . Indeed, comparisons have been drawn between the design of the Ro 80 and the aerodynamic 1982 Audi 100 built in the same factory some 15 years later. NSU Ro 80 club meeting in Antwerp, 1993 The basic wedge profile of this 1967 design was much emulated in subsequent decades NSU Ro 80, IAA-Modell, Museum Autovision, Altlu√üheim, Germany  Interior  Interior trim combined cloth covered seats with PVC headlining and a carpeted floor. Leather seats were a factory option, although rarely specified.  Evolution  The company's limited resources focused on improving the reliability of the rotary engine, with much attention given to the material used for the three rotor tips (apex seals) for the oval-like epitrochoid- shaped rotor housing that sealed the combustion chambers. A feature of the engine was its willingness to rev quickly and quietly to very high engine speeds, but it was precisely at these high speeds that damage to key engine components occurred: all Ro 80s came with a rev counter, but cars produced after 1971 also came with an \\"acoustical signal\\" that warned the driver when the engine was rotating too fast. The Ro 80 remained largely unchanged over its ten-year production. From September 1969 the rectangular headlights were replaced with twin halogen units, and air extractor vents appeared on the C-pillar behind the doors. In August 1970 a slightly reshaped plastic grill replaced the metal grill of the early cars, and a minimal facelift in May 1975 saw the final cars getting enlarged rear lights and rubber inserts in the bumpers which increased the car's overall length by 15 mm to 4,795 mm. The placement of the rear license plate was also changed from below the bumper to above it. This resulted in the bootlid lock being repositioned to the rear lip of the bootlid itself, instead of just below it.  Unreliability  The car developed an early reputation for unreliability. The Ro 80 engine in particular suffered from construction faults, among many other problems, and some early cars required a rebuilt engine before , with problems arising as early as . Originally, the rotor tip seals were made in three pieces, out of the same material. The motor's design caused the center section to wear more quickly at cold starts compared to the other pieces; the worn center pieces allowed the two other parts of the seal to move, which in turn allowed combustion products to escape the seals. The tip seal center piece was then redesigned using ferrotic material, and the problem was entirely resolved. The fact that the rotary engine design had inherently poor fuel economy (typically 13-16 l/100 km) and a poor understanding of the Wankel engine by dealers and mechanics did not help this situation. By the 1970 model year, most of the reliability issues had been resolved, but a necessarily generous warranty policy and damage to the car's reputation had undermined NSU's financial situation irreparably. NSU was acquired by Volkswagen in 1969, and merged with Auto Union to create the modern day Audi company. Alternative power source In the UK, owners left with cars with seized engines were provided with a solution by the Hurley Engineering Company. They supplied a torque converter adapter plate and other fittings so that a Ford Essex V4 engine could be fitted in the space left by a removed rotary engine. It was the only engine short enough to fit in the vacated space without modification to the body work. Depending on which Ford model it came from, the engine was available with front or rear sump wells, crank pulley or timing case mounted cooling fan, two capacities and a low compression version for using low grade fuel. In terms of smoothness and refinement, the V4 was rough-running compared to the turbine quality of the rotary engine, but what the V4 did provide was dependability, an increase in torque and an improvement in fuel consumption. Later, a Ford V6 was tried but needed body modifications, had poor fuel economy and did not quite have the right handling balance.  Production  Series production began in October 1967 and the last examples came off the production line in April 1977. During 1968, the first full year of production, 5,986 cars were produced, increasing to 7,811 in 1969 and falling slightly to 7,200 in 1970. After this output declined, to about 3,000 - 4,000 per year for the next three years. The relatively high fuel consumption of the rotary engine worked against the car after the dramatic fuel price rises accompanying the oil crisis of 1973, and between 1974 and 1976 annual production came in well below 2,000 units. In total 37,398 Ro80s were produced during the ten- year production run. Ultimately, it was the contrasting success of the similarly-sized Audi 100 that sealed both the fate of the Ro 80, and the NSU brand as a whole within the Auto Union-NSU combine, as parent company Volkswagen began nurturing Audi as its performance-luxury brand in the late 1970s. After the discontinuation of the Ro 80 in 1977, the Neckarsulm plant was switched over entirely to producing Audi's C- and D- platform vehicles (the 100/200, and later the Audi A6 and A8), and the NSU brand disappeared from the public eye.

Overview  Intelligent control can be divided into the following major sub-domains: * Neural network control * Machine learning control * Reinforcement learning * Bayesian control * Fuzzy control * Neuro-fuzzy control * Expert Systems * Genetic control New control techniques are created continuously as new models of intelligent behavior are created and computational methods developed to support them.  Neural network controller  Neural networks have been used to solve problems in almost all spheres of science and technology. Neural network control basically involves two steps: * System identification * Control It has been shown that a feedforward network with nonlinear, continuous and differentiable activation functions have universal approximation capability. Recurrent networks have also been used for system identification. Given, a set of input- output data pairs, system identification aims to form a mapping among these data pairs. Such a network is supposed to capture the dynamics of a system. For the control part, deep reinforcement learning has shown its ability to control complex systems.  Bayesian controllers  Bayesian probability has produced a number of algorithms that are in common use in many advanced control systems, serving as state space estimators of some variables that are used in the controller. The Kalman filter and the Particle filter are two examples of popular Bayesian control components. The Bayesian approach to controller design often requires an important effort in deriving the so-called system model and measurement model, which are the mathematical relationships linking the state variables to the sensor measurements available in the controlled system. In this respect, it is very closely linked to the system- theoretic approach to control design.

His problems with his sight, which ultimately led to blindness, began in the early 1770s and forced him to paint larger works in oils and pastel.

Construction and design Her keel was laid down on 11 July 1944 by the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard. She was launched on 17 October 1944 sponsored by Mrs. W. C. Ploeser, and commissioned on 14 February 1945 with Lieutenant Commander H. D. Sipple in command. Service history Conger tested new submarine equipment at New London, Connecticut, until she cleared 21 July 1945 for Pacific service. At sea between Balboa, Panama, and Pearl Harbor upon the end of hostilities, she was ordered back to the Panama Canal Zone, and on 4 September arrived at Key West, Florida, to provide services to the Fleet Sonar School until 6 December. She sailed then for New London and Tompkinsville, New York, where she lay until sailing 10 January 1946 for her assigned home port at Cristobal, Canal Zone. Conger operated in the Caribbean Sea, calling at Memphis, Tennessee, and Vicksburg, Mississippi, in May 1947, until 23 August, when she sailed for a complete circuit of the South American continent on special hydrographic work, passing through the Straits of Magellan.Interpretation of Gravity Anomalies on the Westcoast of South America and in the Caribbean, retrieved 2011-12-21 She returned to the Canal Zone 5 October to resume her Caribbean operations, and from 11 January 1948 made her base at Key West, Florida. On 3 June 1949 her home port became Norfolk, Virginia, and she operated along the East Coast and in the Caribbean assisting in the training of surface ships, taking part in fleet exercises, and perfecting her own readiness for action. She was again transferred in 1952, arriving at New London, Connecticut, her new home port, 12 December. From that time through 1960, she continued her East Coast operations, and frequently put to sea with student submariners on board. Conger was fitted with Bottom Reflection Active Sonar System II (BRASS II) sonar equipment in 1961. BRASS II led to the sonar sphere used on the Thresher class and all subsequent US attack submarines. Conger was reclassified as an auxiliary submarine and given the hull classification symbol AGSS-477 in 1962. She was decommissioned on 29 July 1963, struck from the Naval Vessel Register on 1 August 1963, and sold for scrapping in May 1964.

It has a relatively reflective surface and an M-type spectrum. Liberatrix is a member of an asteroid family bearing its own name. Discovery and name It was discovered by Prosper Henry on September 11, 1872, from Paris. Some sources give Paul Henry sole credit for its discovery.Schmadel Lutz D. Dictionary of Minor Planet Names (fifth edition), Springer, 2003. . The asteroid's name is a feminine version of the word \\"liberator\\". Henry may have chosen the name to mark the liberation of France from Prussia during the Franco-Prussian War in 1870. More specifically, it may honor Adolphe Thiers, the first President of the French Republic, who arranged a loan that enabled the Prussian troops to be removed from France. Observations In the late 1990s, a network of astronomers worldwide gathered lightcurve data to derive the spin states and shape models of 10 asteroids, including Liberatrix. Liberatrix's lightcurve has a large amplitude of 0.4 in magnitude, indicating an elongated or irregular shape.Durech, J.; Kaasalainen, M.; Marciniak, A.; Allen, W. H. et al. \\"Asteroid brightness and geometry,\\" Astronomy and Astrophysics, Volume 465, Issue 1, April I 2007, pp. 331-337. The spectrum of this asteroid matches a M-type asteroid. It may be the remnant of an asteroid that had undergone differentiation, with orthopyroxene minerals scattered evenly across the surface. There is no indication of hydration. To date, there have been at least two observed occultations by Liberatrix. Early on December 11, 2014, Liberatrix occulted a 9th magnitude star and will be visible over the majority of Southern California and a swath of Mexico.

They were serfs of the Demidovs ‚Äì a famous family of factory owners. In 1810s, Yefim built a progressive machine-building plant, equipped with a full range of innovative metal-cutting lathes (such as screw- cutters, gear-cutting serrating machines and others).

Miron became chief mechanic after his father's death. Innovations=Industrial machinery The Cherepanovs significantly improved the machinery that had been used in blast-furnace and gold-mining industries, iron and copper works, sawmills, and flourmills. Steam engines The most interesting aspect of the Cherepanovs' work were steam engines which they tried to introduce into industrial production. From 1820, the Cherepanovs built about 20 steam engines that ranged from 2 to 60 hp. Railroad In 1833-34 they built the first Russian steam locomotive.

Nicknamed \\"Dolly\\", D'Oliveira played county cricket for Worcestershire from 1964 to 1980, and appeared for England in 44 Test matches and four One Day Internationals between 1966 and 1972. Early life D'Oliveira was born into a religious Catholic family in Signal Hill, Cape Town; he believed that his family probably came from Madeira, not Malaya or Indonesia like most of his community and this explained his Portuguese surname. As a boy he visited the Newlands Cricket Ground in Cape Town, and climbed the trees outside to watch the games. He captained South Africa's national non-white cricket team, and also played football for the non-white national side. Career With the support of John Arlott, and the members and supporters of St Augustine's Cricket Club in Cape Town, he emigrated to England in 1960, where the journalist John Kay found him a place in the Central Lancashire League team of Middleton. D'Oliveira noted his surprise at seeing white people doing menial work, and waiting on him in restaurants.http://www.hinduonnet.com/thehindu/thscrip/print.pl?file=20050625006302200.htm&date;=tss2826/&prd;=tss& He joined the first-class county team Worcestershire County Cricket Club in 1964, and became a British citizen. In 1966 he was selected for the England cricket team as an all-rounder to face the West Indians in the second Test. He made a solid debut, scoring 27 before being run out, and returning bowling figures of 1 for 24 and 1 for 46 in 39 overs. In the third Test he scored 76 and 54, while capturing 2 wickets for 51 and 2 for 77 at Trent Bridge; though the West Indies cantered to a 139-run victory. He contributed a fighting 88 in the fourth Test at Headingley, although England once again lost, by an innings and 55 runs. D'Oliveira was quietly efficient in the final Test as England turned the tables on the West Indies, winning by an innings and 34 runs to lose the series 3-1. Against India he hit 109 in the first Test where England won by six wickets and went on to win the series 3-0. Facing Pakistan he hit fifties in both innings of the first Test, in a series that England won 2-0. He was one of the Wisden Cricketers of the Year for 1967. Next up was an away series against the West Indies, early in 1968. D'Oliveira did not turn in his best showing in the five matches, scoring only 137 runs at an average of 27.4. He did a lot of bowling, but picked up only three wickets, even though he was economical. Once back in England, it was time for a five-Test Ashes series. The Aussies crushed England by 159 runs in the first Test as England crumbled in their second innings, despite D'Oliveira's top scoring effort of 87 not out. He was then dropped for the subsequent three Tests. He was recalled by the selectors for the final Test at the Oval, and 158 runs in the first innings against Australia seemed to have guaranteed his place in the side to play the 1968‚Äì69 Test series in South Africa. He was left out of the touring party under the pretext that his bowling would not be effective in his native country. He was selected in June 1969 to face the West Indies, this time in a three-Test series. He followed that with a three-match series against New Zealand and then a seven-Test Ashes series in Australia, in which he scored 369 runs at an average of 36.9, including 117 in the fifth Test at the MCG. England then went to New Zealand for two Tests, with D'Oliveira scoring 100 in the first one and 58 and five in the second. Pakistan next visited England in 1971, and D'Oliveira enjoyed a fine series with the bat, making 241 runs at an average of 60.25. He was below par in the three-Test series against India that followed, but was in better form for the visit of Australia in June 1972. D'Oliveira completed his playing career having played 41 Tests. He scored 2484 runs at an average of 40.06, with five centuries and 15 fifties. He also captured 47 wickets at 39.55. After his retirement from first-class cricket D‚ÄôOliveira was the Worcestershire coach from 1980 to 1990. Playing style and personality D'Oliveira was a successful batsman with a low backlift and powerful strokes. He was also a tough competitor. When he toured Australia in 1970‚Äì71 on the night after they won the series 2‚Äì0 he pushed his forefinger into the chest of every Australian he met, saying \\"We stuffed you.\\" Wanting to play international cricket, D'Oliveira was somewhat cagey about his date of birth. After his death, journalist Pat Murphy with whom he collaborated on his autobiography stated: The D'Oliveira Affair South African cricket officials in 1968 realised that the inclusion of D'Oliveira in the England squad would lead to the cancellation of the tour, and probable exclusion of South Africa from Test cricket. This exerted pressure on the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) hierarchy leading to the decision not to pick him, which was felt by opponents of apartheid to be a way of keeping cricket links with South Africa open. There was dissent in the press to this course of events and when Warwickshire's Tom Cartwright was ruled out because of injury, D'Oliveira was called up into the squad. South African prime minister B. J. Vorster had already made it clear that D'Oliveira's inclusion was not acceptable, and despite many negotiations the tour was cancelled; South Africa was excluded from Test cricket for 22 years. This was seen as a watershed in the sporting boycott of apartheid South Africa. The D'Oliveira Affair had a massive impact in turning international opinion against the apartheid regime in South Africa. It prompted changes in South African sport and eventually in society. The events of 1968 were dramatized on BBC Radio 4 in April 2009 in a play by Christopher Douglas entitled Dolly. Legacy In 2000, he was nominated as one of 10 South African cricketers of the century, despite not having played for South Africa. In 2004, a perpetual trophy was struck for Test series between England and South Africa, and named the Basil D'Oliveira Trophy. In 2005, he was awarded a CBE in the Queen's Birthday Honours. In the same year, a stand at New Road, Worcester, was named in his honour. In 1980 after the end of his playing career, he wrote an autobiography with the BBC's Pat Murphy, titled Time to Declare. In it, he stated for the first time that he was glad that the proposed South African cricket tour to England in 1970 was called off, for fear of public disturbances. In 2004, journalist Peter Oborne wrote a biography entitled Basil D'Oliveira: Cricket and Conspiracy (), which was awarded the William Hill Sports Book of the Year and was accompanied by Paul Yule's RTS award-winning documentary Not Cricket‚ÄîThe Basil D'Oliveira Conspiracy. Personal life He was married to Naomi, and their son Damian D'Oliveira also played first-class cricket for Worcestershire CCC and joined the coaching staff after his retirement from playing. His grandson, Brett D'Oliveira, is a current Worcestershire CCC player having made his debut for the county in 2011. There has been a D'Oliveira on the staff at Worcestershire CCC, as either player or coach, ever since Basil first joined the County in 1964. Death D'Oliveira had Parkinson's disease in later life. He died aged 80 (or possibly 83) in England, on 19 November 2011. A farewell for D'Oliveira was written on the last 2011 issue of Time magazine by Trevor Manuel, South Africa's Minister in the Presidency for National Planning. It highlights the personal successes of the cricket player, together with the impact he had on South African sport and society. A memorial service was held in Worcester Cathedral on 27 January 2012; Sir Michael Parkinson gave one of the eulogies. In September 2018 he was posthumously awarded the Freedom of the City of Worcester in recognition of his contribution to the city. The award was accepted by his son Shaun at a ceremony in the Guildhall in Worcester on 14 September 2018.

It does not mean an \\"accident\\" as used in common parlance, a chance incident, normally harmful. Aristotle made a distinction between the essential and accidental properties of a thing. Thomas Aquinas and other Catholic theologians have employed the Aristotelian concepts of substance and accident in articulating the theology of the Eucharist, particularly the transubstantiation of bread and wine into body and blood. In this example, the bread and wine are considered accidents, since at transubstantiation, they become incidental to the essential substance of body and blood. In modern philosophy, an accident (or accidental property) is the union of two concepts: property and contingency. Non-essentialism argues that every property is an accident. Modal necessitarianism argues that all properties are essential and no property is an accident. Aristotle  Aristotle made a distinction between the essential and accidental properties of a thing. For example, a chair can be made of wood or metal, but this is accidental to its being a chair: that is, it is still a chair regardless of the material from which it is made. To put this in technical terms, an accident is a property which has no necessary connection to the essence of the thing being described. To take another example, all bachelors are unmarried: this is the necessary or essential property of what it means to be a bachelor. A particular bachelor may have brown hair, but this would be a property particular to that individual, and with respect to his bachelorhood it would be an accidental property. And this distinction is independent of experimental verification: even if for some reason all the unmarried men with non-brown hair were killed, and every single existent bachelor had brown hair, the property of having brown hair would still be accidental since it would still be logically possible for a bachelor to have hair of another color. The nine kinds of accidents according to Aristotle are quantity, quality, relation, habitus, time, location, situation (or position), action, and passion (\\"being acted on\\"). Together with \\"substance\\", these nine kinds of accidents constitute the ten fundamental categories of Aristotle's ontology.Marc Cohen, Catholic theologians such as Thomas Aquinas have employed the Aristotelian concepts of substance and accident in articulating the theology of the Eucharist, particularly the transubstantiation of bread and wine into body and blood. According to this tradition, the accidents (or species) of the appearance of bread and wine do not change, but the substance changes from bread and wine to the Body and Blood of Christ.  Modern philosophy  In modern philosophy, an accident (or accidental property) is the union of two concepts: property and contingency. In relation to the first, an accidental property (Greek symbebekos) is at its most basic level a property. The color \\"yellow\\", \\"high value\\", \\"Atomic Number 79\\" are all properties, and are therefore candidates for being accidental. On the other hand, \\"gold\\", \\"platinum\\", and \\"electrum\\" are not properties, and are therefore not classified as accidents. There are two opposed philosophical positions that also impact the meaning of this term: *Anti-essentialism (associated with Willard Van Orman Quine) argues that there are no essential properties at all, and therefore every property is an accident. *Modal necessitarianism (associated with Saul Kripke), argues for the veracity of the modal system \\"Triv\\" (If P is true, then P must be true). The consequence of this theory is that all properties are essential (and no property is an accident).

Biography Born in 1862 in Mansfield, Connecticut, Cross attended Natchaug School in Willimantic, Connecticut. He graduated from Yale University (B.A. 1885) and served as principal of Staples High School in Westport, Connecticut for a short time around 1885 before returning to Yale as a graduate student, earning a PhD in English literature in 1889. Cross spent several years as a high school principal and schoolteacher at Staples High School in Westport before being offered a job as a professor of English at Yale in 1894. Over the next 36 years, he taught at Yale, became editor of the Yale Review, Sterling Professor of English in 1922, and Dean of the Yale Graduate School from 1916 to 1930. On July 17, 1889, he was married to Helen Baldwin Avery, and they had four children; Wilbur Lucius Cross, Jr., Avery Cross, Elizabeth Cross, and Arthur Cross. Cross became a well-known literary critic. Along with C. F. Tucker Brooke, Cross was the editor of the Yale Shakespeare; he also edited the Yale Review for almost 30 years. He wrote several books, including Life and Times of Laurence Sterne (1909) and The History of Henry Fielding (1918), and several books on the English novel. After retiring from Yale, Cross was elected governor of Connecticut as a Democrat in 1930 and served as Governor for four two-year terms, from January 7, 1931 to January 4, 1939. He was a Delegate to the Democratic National Convention from Connecticut in 1936. He was defeated in 1938 in his attempt to gain re-election for a fifth term. He is credited with passage of several items of reform legislation during his tenure of governor, which included measures related to the abolition of child labor, and instituted a minimum wage rate. Also there was legislation that authorized governmental reorganization, and improved factory laws. He also endorsed legislation that authorized funding for the rebuilding of the Connecticut State College, which included the construction of the first campus library, named the Cross Library. During his tenure, eugenicist Harry H. Laughlin served on a commission proposing radical eugenic policies that were never implemented.Paul Bass, \\"Cross Era's Dark Secret Resurfaces\\" New Haven Independent, Sept. 24, 2014.

While unveiling the award he said, \\"The great minds of today need to focus on the problems of global significance if humanity is to see new tomorrows\\" adding, \\"These awards are designed to encourage writing by authors throughout the world and in all languages that creates positive solutions to global problems.\\" In addition to a $500,000 award, the fellowship included a hardcover publishing contract with Turner Broadcasting's publishing unit and $50,000 to market the book and a film option. Three awards of merit were also presented, which included $50,000, a publishing contract and film option, to Sara Cameron for her novel \\"Natural Enemies\\", Janet Keller for \\"Necessary Risks\\" and Andy Goldblatt for \\"The Bully Pulpit.\\" In addition to Ray Bradbury, the judges included: Nobel Laureate for Literature Nadine Gordimer, novelists Wallace Stegner, Peter Matthiessen, William Styron and Rodney Hall as well as Betty and Ian Ballantine, founders of Ballantine Books. Thomas H. Guinzburg, former president of Viking Press and founder of Paris Review, was the managing director.  Controversy  Some of the judges, including novelists William Styron, Peter Matthiessen and Wallace Stegner, felt while Ishmael was the best of the 12 manuscripts, \\"we didn't feel it was worth anything remotely like $500,000.\\" They felt that Michael Reagan, of Turner Publishing, had handled their grievances dishonestly. Ray Bradbury disagreed with his fellow judges: \\"This is a fine piece of work... If Kitty Kelley can make $5-million-to-$6 million, why not half-a-million for a real book?\\" $10,000 was paid to each of the nine judges.
