He is Executive Director of the University Of New Hampshire Broadband Center Of Excellence and Founder and Board Member of the YAS Foundation. Yassini is the author of ‚ÄúPlanet Broadband‚Äù (Cisco Press, 2003), a humanized look at broadband technology and its contributions to the society, as well as ‚ÄúBroadband Intelligent Series‚Äù, a series of white papers on digital services (voice, data, video). He is a worldwide speaker and is often interviewed and quoted in the press for his vision on the future of broadband. His lifetime vision and dream is that all the people in the world have ubiquitous access to the broadband and be connected all the time. He believes that broadband connectivity is a fundamental right for all the human beings, what he has referred to it frequently as \\"Broadband Equality\\". Yassini was founder, CEO, and president of LANcity, the early pioneer in cable modems (acquired by Bay Networks in 1996). He has worked with Cable Television Laboratories, Inc. (CableLabs) a research arm of the cable television industry in charge of the DOCSIS and on CableHome projects as the cable industry's point man on standardizing the cable modem's global footprint. He served as a senior executive consultant to the cable industry's CEOs while being president and CEO of YAS Corporation. He also has worked with Comcast and Cablevision on numerous programs relating to innovation of broadband technologies. From 2004-2007, Yassini worked with the CTO's office at Comcast to create the first industry standard IP-Set top Box specification known as the RNG specification. He has been involved in managing and advising companies ranging from $100 million to $50 billion and served as member of the board of directors on BAS (acquired by ADC in 2000), TrueChat (acquired by Terayon in 2001), and Entropic from 2001 to 2008 (IPO 2007), and UPC Technical Advisory Committee. He created and chaired the Vendor and Operator Executive Advisory Forum of the U.S. Cable Center. He was a member of the Liberty Global Inc. (LGI) advisory technology board from 2001-2017. Yassini has been a director of Visteon since January 2015. He is currently a member of the executive leadership team for IRYStec, a Montreal-based firm founded in 2015 specializing in perceptual display processing technology where he serves as Chairman of the board. Working for more than 30 years in the broadband industry and achieving major accomplishments, Yassini received many awards from different organizations. He was named multiple times as CED Broadband 50 designate. CED Magazine named him ‚Äú1998 Man of the Year‚Äù for creating and fostering the multibillion-dollar cable modem broadband industry. The National Cable & Telecommunications Association (NCTA) awarded Yassini with a 2004 Vanguard Award, the Cable Industry's highest honor in recognition of his contributions and dedication to the industry. The Cable Television Pioneers also inducted Yassini into the class of 2012 for his tremendous and meaningful contributions to the cable industry. He is a member of the Lane Department Academy as well as West Virginia University Academy of Distinguished Alumni. Life and career Born in Tehran, Iran, Yassini went to Kharazami high school and attended University of Pahlavi for one year before immigrating to the United States in 1977. Settling in Morgantown, WV, he continued his education at WVU, pursuing a bachelor's degree in Science and Electrical Engineering. As a senior, he was fascinated by the burgeoning satellite communications industry, and toiled with classmates to build one of the first 3.7 ‚Äì 4.2 GHz down converters. Upon graduation in 1981, he was recruited by General Electric, the place that entered him into high-tech industry. In 1984 he had his first brush with the cable TV industry, working with GE's Comband division developing the company's first 5,000-gate custom designed set-top chip. After numerous promotions, as the \\"Engineering Manager for Cable TV systems and microwave\\" he left GE in 1986 to work for Proteon a data networking company manufacturing token ring networking products like routers and bridges. It was at Proteon, that the idea of using the same cable for transmitting video and data came to him. Though, people told him video and data couldn't mix. From 1988 to 1990 he oversaw Applitek, a data networking company, as president and CEO where he was persuaded that mixing video and data is possible, although the vision remained on hold until 1990 when he bought Applitek's assets and formed LANcity where the cable modem was born and the DNA of broadband was built. LANcity Rouzbeh Yassini pose with original LANcity modem at the Cable Center in Denver, Colorado. In 1990, Yassini founded LANcity, introducing the first high-speed communications modem designed to integrate with cable television networks, spawning a new consumer electronics technology category known as the cable modem used today by more than 12 million U.S. households. Yassini knew that he had to build a product that was based on industry standards, and not proprietary protocols. Hence, the priority of his small company with 13 employees was to develop an \\"Ethernet bridge\\" that interfaced between an Ethernet data network on one side, and the broadband cable TV network on the other. His vision and tremendous effort in Cable Technology and Data Networking eventually resulted in the invention of Cable Modems, creation of the broadband industry and the era of the high-speed cable modem. The first generation of modems cost $15,000 for LANcity, and was not compatible with all cable configurations. Yassini took assistance from DEC to build the second generation modems. However, with the advent of personal computers, DEC faced financial problems, so Yassini brought in John Ulm from Hewlett Packard to redesign the modem, and Kurt Baty was hired to develop a new 200,000-gate silicon chip. With his new team and more than a decade of his vision in cable and data technology, in 1993 LANcity launched its second generation modems, at $5000 which was more affordable and more reliable and drew the attention of respected industry engineers. By 1995, LANcity deployed its third-generation \\"plug-and-play\\" modem for less than $500, obtained 80 percent of the admittedly small cable modem market share. Bringing the technology from $15,000 to $500 within five years and making it more affordable for personal use was a great achievement for LANcity that was acquired by Bay Networks in mid-1996. DOCSIS In late 1996 Yassini was invited to join Cable Television Laboratories (CableLabs) to establish the Cable Modem Industry Standards DOCSIS. He worked 18-hour days at the CableLabs office in Denver, CO, driving a team of volunteer staff from 400 suppliers and 20 cable operators, and key contributors to establish Data over Cable Service Interface Specifications (DOCSIS), a pillar of today's worldwide, multibillion-dollar broadband industry. His tremendous effort within the first six years of working with CableLabs with responsibility over strategic vision, tactical execution, and budgeting resulted in a fully interoperable cable modem standard, a complex document that is used by many cable operators to transfer data over their cable infrastructures. Yassini also worked through the Society of Cable and Telecommunications Engineers (SCTE) and the International Telecommunications Union (ITU) to establish DOCSIS as an international standard. His prominent contribution to DOCSIS and his pioneering work in cable broadband technology as founder and CEO of LANcity, earned him the title of ‚ÄúFather of Cable Modem‚Äù. Yassini worked with CableLabs to improve DOCSIS to address the issues on Bandwidth and business quality Services from (1996-2003). YAS Corporation, LLC In 1996, Yassini founded YAS Corporation, LLC in Boston, MA where he served as CEO and president from 1997-2017. As founder, president and CEO of ‚ÄúYAS‚Äù (which refers to a pleasant-smelling Iranian flower Of Jasmine), Yassini was instrumental in the creation of multiple start-up companies that have either been acquired or have successfully staged initial public stock offerings. He also led hundreds of strategic and tactical projects that improved the quality of life for citizens across the world. He served as senior executive consultant and member of the board of directors on a number of privately and publicly held companies, ranging from small innovative start- ups (Broadband Access Systems, TrueChat, Entropic Communications, and others) to leading broadband service providers such as Comcast, Cablevision Systems Corp., Cox Communications and Time Warner Cable, which collectively serve tens of millions of customers. He is currently a member of the Liberty Global Inc. (LGI) advisory technology board and UPC Technical Advisory Committee.  Yassini Broadband Knowledge Center (YBKC)  In the spring of 2008, Yassini opened the Yassini Broadband Knowledge Center (YKBC), in Boston, MA. The Broadband Academy, which is the research division of YAS, built and operated the first ever broadband building with 50 Broadband applications showcasing TRUE POWER OF Broadband, and offering grants and facilities to advance and promote broadband technologies, services, and applications. The center was transferred later to the University of New Hampshire in 2012, through the Broadband Center of Excellence (UNHBCoE).  UNHBCoE  To further the pursuit of his long term vision to ensure global, ubiquitous broadband connectivity for all, in September 2013 Yassini announced the opening of the University Of New Hampshire Broadband Center Of Excellence (UNHBCoE) in Durham, N.H where he acts as its executive director and board member, oversees the center's efforts to investigate fresh ideas in broadband Internet technology and make the technology available to everyone, everywhere. At UNHBCoE, Yassini with a team of researchers, professors, and broadband pioneers (the same team at YKBC) put all his effort to extend broadband to unserved and under-served communities, promotes UNH as a fully broadband-enabled university and home to the UNH Interoperability Laboratory, a world-recognized independent networking and data communications testing facility and to show how an entire city or state can use broadband services and improve the quality of life. His lifetime dream is that all the people in the world are connected to the broadband 24√ó7 no matter where they are located.

Definition  God games are a subgenre of artificial life game, where players use supernatural powers to indirectly influence a population of simulated worshippers. It has also been categorized as a subgenre of strategy video games, though unlike other strategy video games, players are unable to tell specific units what to do. The genre is also separate from construction and management simulations, because gameplay revolves around growing and utilizing their supernatural powers to indirectly influence their worshippers, such as by placing a target marker or goal for the worshippers to conquer, or affect those of their opponents, such as by creating natural disasters. God games are typically single-player games played against a computerized opponent, but some involve competition between all rival players.  Game design  God games allow players to take on the role of a god with limited powers, similar to the gods from the mythology of ancient Greece. The player's power comes from simulated worshippers, who are usually simple or tribal in nature. It is common for most people in god games to look alike. Early god games only featured models for full-grown men and women, while Black and White introduced children. Players must economize quantities of power or mana, which are derived from the size and prosperity of their population of worshippers. The player consumes this power by using godly powers to help their worshippers, such as blessing their crops or flattening hills to make better farmland. This results in a positive feedback loop, where more power allows the player to help their population grow which helps them gain more power. However, more powerful abilities typically require more power, and these usually take the form of natural disasters that can damage rival populations rather than improve life for the player's worshippers. Games typically utilize an aerial top-down perspective, similar to a real-time strategy game. God games are classified as a subgenre of artificial life game because players tend to a population of simulated people that they control only indirectly. Although god games share qualities with both construction and management simulation games and real-time strategy games, players in god games are only able to exercise indirect control over their population. They cannot tell specific units what to do, as seen in strategy games, although players may sometimes compete against other players with their own population of supporters. Moreover, players are given godlike powers not seen in construction or management games, such as the ability to control the weather, transform the landscape, and bless or curse different populations.  History  Although there are many influences on the god game genre, the first god game is widely considered to be Populous from 1989. Developed by Peter Molyneux of Bullfrog Productions, the game established the gameplay template where the player's godlike powers would grow in proportion to the population of their worshippers. The game gives players supernatural powers over land and nature that could be used for good or evil, and some of this gameplay was emulated by other real-time strategy games with more direct control. Notable hybrids of the genre include ActRaiser for the Super NES in 1990. It was also an influence on the real-time strategy hybrid Dungeon Keeper, developed by Molyneux in 1997. Both Molyneux's Black & White and Godus were heavily influenced by the Populous series.

Early life Born in Petersfield, Manitoba, he was one of 11 children of Henry and Arabella Prince of the Brokenhead Ojibway Nation near Scanterbury, Manitoba. He was the great- great-grandson of the Indigenous Chief, Peguis, who had led his nation from Sault Ste. Marie to the southern end of Lake Winnipeg in the late 1790s, keeping their French name, the Saulteaux. Growing up, Prince became a superb marksman with exceptional tracking skills learned from countless days spent hunting in the wilderness around his Indigenous reserve. He attended Elkhorn Residential School, completing grade eight. After leaving school he was employed at a variety of manual-labor positions but primarily as a tree feller. He joined the army cadets while a teenager.  Military Career  =World War II= At the start of World War II Prince volunteered to fight with the Canadian Army and, although he easily met the requirements for recruitment, he was turned down several times before he was finally accepted on June 3, 1940. He was originally a member of the Royal Canadian Engineers, trained as a sapper. He volunteered for duty with a parachute unit designated the 2nd Canadian Parachute Battalion. This designation was used to disguise the true reason for the recruitment of parachute volunteers in the UK at that time: the United States and Canada had begun the formation of a special force to conduct sabotage in Norway. Men were recruited in Canada and the overseas army for this unit, dubbed the First Special Service Force. The Canadians involved with this training continued to be on the rosters of their prior units. Although later dubbed the 2nd Canadian Parachute Battalion for administrative purposes, the unit did not actually exist. Prince then reported to the UK's parachute school at RAF Ringway, near Manchester. He was promoted to lance corporal in February 1941. In September 1942 he returned to Canada and joined the 1st Canadian Parachute Battalion (1CPB), and was promoted to sergeant. He volunteered for the 1st Canadian Special Service Battalion and proceeded to Fort Benning, Georgia, where they were forming. The Canadians were well below strength due to injuries in training and washouts. They agreed to bolster the 1st Special Service Force (known as the \\"Devil's Brigade\\") by allowing men to volunteer. Prince and the other men of this unit were originally chosen for their rugged outdoor backgrounds and received rigorous training, often under live fire. All members of this elite unit received intense instruction in stealth tactics, hand-to-hand combat, the use of explosives for demolition, amphibious warfare, rock climbing and mountain fighting and as ski troops. Prince became a \\"Reconnaissance Sergeant\\"‚Äîor, in the Force table of organization, a \\"Scout\\"‚Äîresponsible for moving into forward positions and reporting on the movements of the enemy. The SSF moved to Italy in November 1943. They would take part in the clearing of the Bernhard or Winter Line preventing the Allied push towards Rome. They attacked and captured Monte la Difensa, Hill 720, Monte Majo and Monte Vischiataro in December and January. They were then moved to Anzio. On February 8, 1944, near Littoria, Prince was sent forward to report the location of several German assembly points, including artillery positions. From an abandoned farmhouse about from the enemy assembly area, he could report the location of their emplacements using of telephone wire. An artillery duel followed as the Allies attempted to knock out the guns reported by Prince, and one of these rounds cut the telephone wire. Prince walked out dressed as a farmer weeding the crops; locating the damaged wires, he rejoined them while pretending to tie his shoelaces. He made a show of shaking his fist at the nearby Germans, then again toward the Allied lines. Returning to his lookout spot he continued his reports, and over the next 24 hours four German batteries were knocked out of action.Prince of the Brigade In all he spent three days behind enemy lines. For this action he was awarded the Military Medal, his citation reading (in part) \\"Sergeant Prince's courage and utter disregard for personal safety were an inspiration to his fellows and a marked credit to his unit.\\" After being the vanguard of the US forces liberating Rome on 4 June 1944, the SSF was moved to southern France as part of Operation Dragoon. First they would assault the Hy√®res Islands before going ashore at Sylvabelle on the French Riviera. There the force was ordered, as part of the 1st Airborne Task Force, to push eastward toward the Franco-Italian border. On September 1 Prince and a private were sent forward through the German lines to scout their positions near L'Escar√®ne and came across an encampment area of an enemy reserve battalion. On the way back to report, Prince and the private came upon a battle between some Germans and a squad of French partisans. They started sniping the Germans, who eventually withdrew. When Prince made contact with the French leader, he asked Prince where his company was located, when Prince pointed to the private and said \\"Here,\\" the French commander exclaimed that he thought there were 50 of them. The French commander recommended Prince for the Croix de Guerre, but the courier was killed en route and the message never reached the French Commander-in-Chief, Charles de Gaulle. Prince continued on to his unit. He then led it back to the encampment and joined in the battle, which resulted in the capture of the entire German battalion, about 1000 men. From start to end Prince had been without food, water or sleep for 72 hours and had walked over 70 km across rugged, mountainous terrain. Afterwards he was recommended for the American Silver Star, his citation reading: After it was determined that both US and Canadian personnel would be better suited if they were dispersed to units in their own forces, the 1st Special Service Force was disbanded in December 1944. After returning to the UK, Prince was summoned to Buckingham Palace on February 12, 1945, where King George VI presented him with his Military Medal. Prince would later receive his Silver Star from US Brigadier-General E.F. Koenig (on behalf of the American President) on April 24, 1945https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t8BPJYqyens Yank Medals For Canucks, Canadian Army Newsreel No 71; he was one of 59 Canadians to receive this award during the war, and one of only three to receive the Silver Star and Military Medal. In addition to the two Decorations, he received six service medals for his service in the Italian and North West Europe theatres of war, The 1939-1945 Star, The Italy Star, The France and Germany Star, The Defence Medal, The Canadian Volunteer Service Medal with Overseas Clasp, and The War Medal 1939-1945. The war in Europe ended while he was in England.  Post World War  Prince was honorably discharged on June 15, 1945, and returned to his home on the Brokenhead Reserve, working in a pulpwood camp. In 1946 a woman attacked him at a dance and cut his cheek with a beer bottle, requiring 64 stitches. After this incident he left the reserve and moved to Winnipeg. Using funding from the Department of Veteran's Affairs, Prince began a small but relatively prosperous cleaning service. He married Verna Sinclair, with whom he had five children. In 1946 he was elected chairman of the Manitoba Indian Association. Entrusting his business to friends, Prince devoted his time to working with the government to improve the conditions for Native peoples. He worked with the association to lobby Ottawa for changes to the Indian Act. While some revisions were made, little actual improvement followed. Frustrated with the red tape of Ottawa, he returned to Winnipeg to discover that his cleaning business had folded in his absence because the friends running it had crashed the truck and sold the parts as scrap metal. Prince worked in lumber camps and a concrete factory to make ends meet. =Korean War= In August 1950 Prince returned to the Canadian Army to fight with the United Nations troops in the Korean War. As he later commented, \\"As soon as I put on my uniform I felt a better man.\\" Re-instated to his previous rank of sergeant, Prince was now a member of the 2nd Battalion Princess Patricia's Canadian Light Infantry (2 PPCLI), the first Canadian regiment to arrive in the war zone. In February 1951 the Patricias joined the 27th Commonwealth Brigade on the battlefield. Prince was second in command of his rifle platoon, and shortly after arrival in Korea he led an eight-man evening \\"snatch patrol\\" into an enemy encampment. The successful patrol returned with two captured machine guns and Prince went on to lead several more raids. However, his CO eventually avoided assigning him patrols because of the risks he took with the lives of his soldiers.Prince Returns to Action Prince was present with the 2 PPCLI when it became the first Canadian unit awarded the United States Presidential Unit Citation for distinguished service in the Battle of Kapyong on April 24‚Äì25, 1951. The battalion had maintained a defense post on Hill 677 despite heavy fire from Chinese and North Korean forces. Prince's wartime duty was taking a toll on his body, and his knees were subject to painful swelling and premature arthritis. He was hospitalized after a medical examination in May 1951, and was later put on administrative duties and returned to Canada, where he served as a platoon sergeant at The Officer Candidate School Canadian Forces Base Borden in Ontario. Here his knees improved, so in March 1952 he volunteered for a second tour of duty in the Far East. He sailed for Korea that October with the 3rd Battalion PPCLI. Though the battalion was officially still training in November 1952, when Chinese forces attacked a key location on the Sami-chon River known as \\"the Hook\\" the 3rd PPCLI was called to defend the rear of the UN forces. The battalion had five members killed, but was able to recapture the post with a UN unit by November 19. Prince was among the nine Patricias wounded; though he recovered from his injuries, he was hospitalized for several weeks in early 1953 for treatment on his knees. The armistice was signed during this period. Prince received the Korea Medal (Canadian version) and the United Nations Korea Medal for his service. He was also entitled, posthumously, to the Canadian Volunteer Service Medal for Korea after it was created in 1991. Following the Korean Armistice Agreement, he remained in the army, working as an instructor of new recruits in Winnipeg, Manitoba, until his honorable discharge on October 28, 1953. He continued to work at a personnel depot in Winnipeg until September 1954. Post War and later life Monument to Tommy Prince, Kildonan Park, Winnipeg, just a few steps from the monument to his ancestor Peguis Adjusting to civilian life had not been easy for Prince after World War II, and with painfully arthritic knees as a result of the long, harsh conditions during his military service, his capabilities were limited. Coupled with the discrimination against Native people at the time, his life became increasingly difficult, ultimately ending in his estrangement from his family and the placement of his children in foster homes. In June 1955 Tommy Prince made the news for his heroism in saving a man from drowning at the Alexander Docks in Winnipeg. However, his personal life kept deteriorating and alcoholism overtook him, resulting in his final years being spent virtually alone, living in a Salvation Army hostel. In order to support himself, he sold off his medals. He died in 1977 at Winnipeg's Deer Lodge Centre, a health care facility specializing in geriatric care and treatment of veterans, and was interred in Brookside Cemetery, Winnipeg. Prince's medals changed hands several times before coming up for auction in London, Ontario. His nephew, Jim Bear, organized a pledge drive and purchased the medals, entrusting them to the Manitoba Museum in Winnipeg. Since his passing, a number of honors have been bestowed in his name.

On February 10, 2010, it was announced that Canadian actor Adam Beach would portray the Canadian war hero in an upcoming movie about his life. According to Bay Film Studios, the movie will be a \\"true account of Canada's most highly decorated First Nations soldier\\". Beach, 37, said he is honoured to play Prince, calling him a positive role model for all First Nations. In June of 2020, a group of Conservative Party of Canada Members of Parliament started a petition and sent a letter to Finance Minister Bill Morneau and Governor of the Bank of Canada Tiff Macklem advocating for Prince's face to be displayed on the Canadian $5 bill.

Its lower deck carries railroad and bicycle/pedestrian traffic, while the upper deck carries road traffic (on the Pacific Highway West No. 1W, former Oregon Route 99W), and light rail (MAX), making the bridge one of the most multimodal in the world. It is the only double-deck bridge with independent lifts in the world and the second oldest vertical-lift bridge in North America, after the nearby Hawthorne Bridge. The bridge links the Rose Quarter and Lloyd District in the east to Old Town Chinatown neighborhood in the west. History The bridge was completed in 1912 and replaced the Steel Bridge that was built in 1888 as a double-deck swing-span bridge. The 1888 structure was the first railroad bridge across the Willamette River in Portland. Its name originated because steel, instead of wrought iron, was used in its construction, which was very unusual for the time. When the current Steel Bridge opened, it was simply given its predecessor's name. The bridge was designed by the engineering firm of Waddell & Harrington,Wood Wortman (2006), pp. 5, 39, 42, 180. which was based in Kansas City, Missouri, but also had an office in Portland. The structure was built by Union Pacific Railroad and the Oregon- Washington Railroad and Navigation Company (OWR&N;) at a cost of $1.7 million (equivalent to $ million in ). It opened in July 1912 to rail traffic and on August 9, 1912, to automobiles. The 1888 Steel Bridge (upper deck) had been crossed by horse-drawn streetcars from the time of its opening and then by the city's first electric streetcar line starting in November 1889; when the present Steel Bridge opened in 1912, the streetcar lines (all electric by then) moved to it, starting on September 8, 1912.\\"New Bridge Used: Streetcars Take New Route for First Time\\" (September 9, 1912). The Morning Oregonian, p. 10. Streetcar service across the Steel continued until August 1, 1948, when the last car lines using it, the Alberta and Broadway Lines, were abandoned. A single line of Portland's once-extensive trolley bus system also used the bridge; the Williams Avenue line crossed the Steel Bridge from February 1937 until October 9, 1949. Many years later, in 1986, electric transit vehicles returned to the bridge in the form of MAX Light Rail and later the Portland Vintage Trolley. In 1950, the Steel Bridge became an important part of a new U.S. 99W highway between Harbor Drive and Interstate Avenue. Harbor Drive was removed in 1974 and replaced with Tom McCall Waterfront Park. A westbound MAX Blue Line train crossing the bridge in 2009. Four of the five MAX lines cross the Steel Bridge. More than 600 MAX trips cross the bridge each weekday. In the mid-1980s, the bridge underwent a $10 million rehabilitation, including construction of the MAX light rail line of TriMet. The span was closed to all traffic for two years, starting in June 1984.\\"Steel Bridge shut down for light rail\\" (June 12, 1984). The Oregonian, p. B1. It reopened on May 31, 1986.Federman, Stan (May 30, 1986). \\"Bridge party trumpets reopening\\". The Oregonian, p. E2. Completion and testing of the light-rail tracks and overhead wires across the bridge took place during the months that followed, and the light rail line opened for service on September 5, 1986. A single-lane viaduct that connected the bridge's east approach to another viaduct (still in existence) that takes traffic from southbound Interstate 5 to Interstate 84 was closed in 1988 and removed in 1989, as part of roadway changes intended to improve traffic flow around the Oregon Convention Center.Federman, Stan (January 18, 1989). \\"Major road repairs this summer could snarl Portland-area traffic\\". The Oregonian, p. B2. The center was under construction at that time and opened in 1990. The lower deck of the bridge was threatened by major floods in 1948, 1964, and 1996. In 2001, a and cantilevered walkway was installed on the southern side of the bridge's lower deck as part of the Eastbank Esplanade construction, raising to three the number of publicly accessible walkways across the bridge, including the two narrow sidewalks on the upper deck. The bridge is owned by Union Pacific with the upper deck leased to Oregon Department of Transportation, and subleased to TriMet, while the City of Portland is responsible for the approaches. An Amtrak Cascades train crossing the bridge The average daily traffic in 2000 was 23,100 vehicles (including many TriMet buses), 200 MAX trains, 40 freight and Amtrak trains, and 500 bicycles. The construction of the lower-deck walkway connected to the Eastbank Esplanade resulted in a sharp increase in bicycle traffic, with over 2,100 daily bicycle crossings in 2005. MAX traffic has tripled since 2000, when only the Gresham‚ÄìHillsboro line (now the Blue Line) was using the bridge, to 605 daily crossings (weekdays) as of 2012. This resulted from the addition of three more MAX lines during that period: the Red, Yellow, Green Lines. In summer 2008, the upper deck was closed for three weeks to allow a junction to be built at the west end connecting the existing MAX tracks with a new MAX line on the Portland Transit Mall. A change made at that time was that the two inner lanes became restricted to MAX trains only, with cars, buses and other motorized traffic permitted only in the two outer lanes. In 2012, the Steel Bridge celebrated its 100th birthday. The Oregonian called it the \\"hardest-working\\" bridge on the Willamette River: \\"Cars, trucks, freight trains, buses, Amtrak, MAX, pedestrians, bicycles ‚Äî you carry it all.\\" Structure and lift operation View from roadway during a lift-span opening The lift span of the bridge is long. At low river levels the lower deck is above the water, and of vertical clearance is provided when both decks are raised. Because of the independent lifts, the lower deck can be raised to , telescoping into the upper deck but not disturbing it. Each deck has its own counterweights, two for the upper and eight for the lower, totaling 9 million lbs. (4,100 metric tons). The machinery house sits atop the upper-deck lift truss. The operator's room is suspended from the top of the lift-span truss, directly below the machinery house, so that the operator can view river traffic as well as the upper deck. After the 2001 addition of a pedestrian walkway on the lower deck, cameras and closed-circuit television monitors were added to allow the operator to view the lower-deck walkway. Until the bridge's mid-1980s renovation, the crossing gates blocking the roadway and sidewalks during raising of the upper-deck lift span were manually operated, rotated horizontally across the roadway by two \\"gate tenders\\", one on each side of the lift span. Small shacks for the gatekeepers were positioned on the roadway deck, between the inner and outer traffic lanes, but they were removed during the 1980s rebuilding and replaced by a new gate tender house positioned above the roadway, in the west lift tower. Powered crossing gates replaced the manual ones, and operation of the gates is now automated, controlled by the bridge operator. Sister Bridge Kansas City ASB Bridge is the other double lift bridge in existence- the car deck shown here has since been removed The Steel Bridge has a sister bridge that opened one year earlier in 1911, the ASB Bridge in Kansas City Missouri. Like the Steel Bridge, the ASB Bridge once carried car, train and streetcar traffic. In 1987 another bridge replaced car traffic and the road deck was permanently closed and taken up. The ASB Bridge now only functions as a railroad bridge for BNSF. See also * List of crossings of the Willamette River References ; General * Wood Wortman, Sharon (2006).

Articuno , known as in Japan, is a dual ice and flying type character in the franchise; Zapdos , known in Japan as is one of the rarest Pok√©mon; and , is based on the mythological Phoenix. Articuno Along with Zapdos and Moltres, Articuno is one of the three winged mirage 'Legendary Pok√©mon.' It is a large bird with the ability to control cold. Articuno was one of many designs conceived by Game Freak and finalized by Ken Sugimori in Pok√©mon Red and Blue. The names of the three mirage Legendary Pok√©mon were changed in the English localization to give them more \\"clever and descriptive names\\". Articuno, for example, comes from a combination of the words \\"Arctic\\", and \\"uno\\", the Spanish word for one. Articuno first appeared in Red and Blue, and has since appeared in all main titles in the series since, notably in the Red and Blue remakes Pok√©mon FireRed and LeafGreen, Pok√©mon Platinum, and Pok√©mon HeartGold and SoulSilver. It makes multiple appearances in Pok√©mon spin-offs, manga, and anime, notably in the film Pok√©mon The Movie 2000. Since appearing in Red and Blue, Articuno has received generally positive reception. Articuno has been featured in several pieces of merchandise, including cards in the Pok√©mon Trading Card Game. Articuno has been compared to other creatures from fiction, including the creatures found in Igor Stravinsky's The Firebird and the monsters in Godzilla on Monster Island. = Design and characteristics = Articuno was one of 151 different designs conceived by Game Freak's character development team and finalized by Sugimori for the first generation of Pocket Monsters games Red and Green, which were localized outside Japan as Pok√©mon Red and Blue. Originally called \\"Freezer\\" in Japanese, Nintendo decided to give the various Pok√©mon species \\"clever and descriptive names\\" related to their appearance or features when translating the game for western audiences as a means to make the characters more relatable to American children. Articuno's English name comes from a combination of \\"Arctic\\", and uno, the Spanish and Italian word for one. Articuno, known as the Freeze Pok√©mon, is a legendary Pok√©mon, one of the legendary birds, along with Zapdos and Moltres. It is a large bird with brown eyes, blue plumage, a bluish-white-feathered chest, a three feathered crest adorning its head and a gray beak with matching legs.

It is a highly rare Pok√©mon; similar to its counterparts Zapdos and Moltres, Articuno appears only once in one game in a fixed location, the Seafoam Islands, and is difficult to defeat or capture. If it is defeated, it disappears and will never be seen again. It also appeared in later core series games, including the Red and Blue remake Pok√©mon FireRed and LeafGreen, Pok√©mon HeartGold and SoulSilver, and Pok√©mon X and Y. In X and Y, Articuno will respawn if the player re-defeats the Elite Four. Outside of the main series, Articuno has appeared in Pok√©mon Snap (where it gives Pikachu a ride in the Cave level), the Pok√©mon Mystery Dungeon games, and Pok√©mon Ranger: Guardian Signs. In Super Smash Bros. Melee, Articuno can be released from a Pok√©Ball, and will use a Blizzard attack that freezes any opponent that is caught in it for a few seconds. In the Pok√©mon spinoff Pok√©mon Mystery Dungeon: Blue Rescue Team and Red Rescue Team, Articuno appears in the Frosty Forest level where it will attack the player. It can be recruited later in the game. In Super Smash Bros. Melee, Articuno appears as a trophy and can be summoned from a Pok√© Ball item, as well as appearing as a trophy in Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS. Articuno also appears as a Spirit alongside Moltres and Zapdos in Super Smash Bros. Ultimate. In the mobile app Pok√©mon Go, Team Mystic is represented by Articuno as a mascot. Following the first Pok√©mon GO Fest in July 2017, Articuno was released into the game and available via the raids feature. In Pok√©mon Sword and Shield's expansion pack, The Crown Tundra, Articuno receives a Galarian Form. This form changes it's typing from Ice and Flying to Psychic and Flying.  In other media  Articuno is featured in Pok√©mon: The Movie 2000 together with the other two Legendary birds, Zapdos and Moltres. In the beginning of the Battle Frontier challenge in the anime, Noland, the battle factory frontier brain had befriended one. After reuniting with their photographer friend Todd, Ash and his friends hear a rumor that Articuno lives on a certain mountain. After several encounters with Team Rocket, Ash and Todd are saved by Articuno from a snowstorm, and Todd manages to snap a picture of it. According to Team Rocket's imagination in the episode called \\"Numero Uno\\", Articuno would come to cool down their boss Giovanni because his area seems to be hot. Articuno appears in the Magical Pok√©mon Journey manga, in The Legendary Articuno!, atop a mountain used by a ski resort. This Articuno is rumored to spirit away the lives of lost travelers, but in reality, it is a friendly Pok√©mon that runs a Snowcone shop. In Pok√©mon Adventures, Articuno was acquired by Team Rocket, and was used by Koga to try to finish Red and Blue and succeeded in freezing them. After Koga being defeated, it is called upon by Sabrina's Kadabra and merged with Zapdos and Moltres to form Zapmolcuno, a combination that proved almost unstoppable until Saur saved its trainers with a web created using Vine Whip and evolved to Venusaur to deliver the final blow with Charizard and Blasty. It at last regains its freedom after the defeat and splits from its fellow birds. Much later, it reappears under Green's possession with its fellow birds and is lent to Red in the battle against Will and Karen, who nearly overwhelmed the three with Ho-Oh and Lugia. = Promotion and reception = Since appearing in Pok√©mon Red and Blue, Articuno has received generally positive reception. Articuno has been featured in several pieces of merchandise, including cards in the Pok√©mon Trading Card Game, figurines, plush toys, and others. The Seattle Post-Intelligencer editor Paula Nechak compared the legendary bird trio as well as Lugia to the creatures found in Igor Stravinsky's The Firebird. GameAxis Unwired praised Articuno along with Zapdos and Moltres for making Pok√©mon Red and Blue \\"cool\\". The Daily Texan criticized Articuno's appearance in the film Pok√©mon 2000, stating that it lacked the \\"human personality that make the other Pokemon so endearing\\". Reeling Reviews editor Robin described the battle conducted between Articuno, Zapdos, and Moltres as being similar to battles from the film Godzilla on Monster Island. Access Atlanta editor Bob Longino criticized the birds' sounds, commenting that the squawking was \\"way too much for adult ears\\". IGN praised the whole legendary bird trio, commenting that even though Zapdos is the strongest of the trio, Articuno is still important. IGN described Articuno as one of both Ice and Flying types, commenting that it was an \\"unappreciated powerhouse\\". IGN editor \\"Pok√©mon of the Day Chick\\" praised Articuno as being \\"particularly beautiful\\". In a poll conducted by IGN, it was voted as the 13th best Pok√©mon, where the staff commented that after \\"solving a perplexing puzzle of rock-pushing and surfing across strong currents\\", \\"adding Articuno to your Pokedex was like earning a badge of honor for completing it.\\" Zapdos Zapdos is one of the legendary bird trio along with Articuno and Moltres. It was created by Satoshi Tajiri. Its English name is a combination of \\"zap\\" and \\"dos\\", the Spanish word for two. Its first appearance was in Pok√©mon Red and Blue, where it acts as one of the rarest Pok√©mon, appearing only once in the entire game. It has made several appearances since, including in the video game Super Smash Bros. Melee, and it was prominently featured in the theatrical anime film Pok√©mon The Movie 2000 as a central character to the plot. =Design and characteristics= Zapdos was one of 151 different designs conceived by Game Freak's character development team and finalized by Sugimori for the first generation of Pocket Monsters games Red and Green, which were localized outside Japan as Pok√©mon Red and Blue. Originally called \\"Thunder\\" in Japanese, Nintendo decided to give the various Pok√©mon species \\"clever and descriptive names\\" related to their appearance or features when translating the game for western audiences as a means to make the characters more relatable to American children. Zapdos' English name comes from a combination of Zap, relating to electricity, and dos, the Spanish word for two. Zapdos, known as the Electric Pok√©mon, is a legendary Pok√©mon, one of the legendary birds, along with Articuno and Moltres. It may be based on the thunderbird. Zapdos has the form of a large bird with black and yellow plumage, with its spiky feathers make it look as if it were made of lightning. Its tail feathers stick out in several directions, furthering this illusion. A large crest of feathers decorates its head, and distinctive black rings encircle its eyes. Zapdos is always seen in conjunction with thunderstorms, because it gathers energy from the electricity in the atmosphere, and is said to live in such clouds.Pok√©dex: A legendary Pok√©mon that is said to live inside thunder clouds.

If it is defeated, it disappears and trainers have no way of running into it again. It also appeared in later core series games, including the Red and Blue remake Pok√©mon FireRed and LeafGreen, Pok√©mon HeartGold and SoulSilver, and Pok√©mon X and Y. Outside of the main series, Zapdos has appeared in the Pok√©mon Mystery Dungeon games, Pok√©mon Snap, Pok√©mon Ranger: Guardian Signs, Super Smash Bros. Melee, and in Super Smash Bros. Ultimate. In the mobile app Pok√©mon Go, Team Instinct is represented by Zapdos as a mascot. Zapdos was originally only available during the game's raid feature, and was first released in August 2017. In Pok√©mon Sword and Shield's expansion pack, The Crown Tundra, Zapdos receives a Galarian Form. This form changes it's typing from Electric and Flying to Fighting and Flying. In other media Zapdos plays small roles in the anime and manga. It is featured in Pok√©mon The Movie 2000 along with the other two Legendary birds, Articuno and Moltres. It appears that Zapdos communicates through electricity as it shocks Pikachu to communicate. Zapdos also appeared in the credits for Pok√©mon Ranger and the Temple of the Sea in which it was captured by Jackie. In Pok√©mon Adventures, Lt. Surge appears with Zapdos in his team during the events of Volume 3, using it as a neverending power source for his Electric- types, until Red uses Saur's Razor Leaf to cut the supply cords. After having been merged with Articuno and Moltres, the three Pallet Town trainers are able to defeat the combined monster. Green later captures Zapdos and uses it against Will and Karen. During this battle, it is lent to Blue. =Promotion and reception= Since appearing in Pok√©mon Red and Blue, Zapdos has generally received positive reception. Nintendo Power conducted a contest where readers could win a Pok√©mon-themed costume, which included a costume of Zapdos. According to Janine Mellini of the Daily Record Zapdos was a popular costume choice amongst Pok√©mon characters for Halloween in 2000. Zapdos has been featured in several pieces of merchandise, including cards in the Pok√©mon Trading Card Game, figurines, plush toys, and others. A special Zapdos card was given away to those who saw the film Pok√©mon The Movie 2000. The Seattle Post-Intelligencer editor Paula Nechak compared the legendary bird trio as well as Lugia to the creatures found in Igor Stravinsky's The Firebird. Author Loredana Lipperini stated that while Zapdos was not very strong, it was her favourite Pok√©mon. GameAxis Unwired praised Zapdos along with Articuno and Moltres for making Pok√©mon Red and Blue \\"cool.\\" The Daily Texan criticized Zapdos' appearance in the film Pok√©mon 2000, stating that it lacked the \\"human personality that make the other Pokemon so endearing\\". Reeling Reviews editor Robin described the battle conducted between Zapdos, Articuno, and Moltres as being similar to battles from the film Godzilla on Monster Island. Access Atlanta editor Bob Longino criticized the birds' sounds, commenting that the squawking was \\"way too much for adult ears.\\" Moltres Moltres,\\"Fire\\" in original Japanese language versions}} is a Pok√©mon species in Nintendo and Game Freak's Pok√©mon franchise. Also created by Sugimori, who has repeatedly stated in multiple interviews he based the design from the Phoenix, Moltres first appeared in the video games Pok√©mon Red and Blue and later in subsequent sequels. Moltres is one of the three winged mirages, along with Articuno and Zapdos. Their names were changed in the English localization to give them more \\"clever and descriptive names.\\" Moltres, for example, comes from a combination of the words \\"molten,\\" relating to lava, and \\"tres,\\" the Spanish word for three. Known as the Flame Pok√©mon, Moltres is a large bird, noted for its ability to control fire. It makes multiple appearances in the anime and manga, notably in the film Pok√©mon The Movie 2000. Moltres also appears in Pok√©mon spin-offs, as well as in the Super Smash Bros. series since Melee. =Design and characteristics= The mythological creature Phoenix, which Moltres resembles Moltres was one of 151 different designs conceived by Game Freak's character-development team and finalized by Sugimori for the first generation of Pocket Monsters games Red and Green, which were localized outside Japan as Pok√©mon Red and Blue. Originally called \\"Fire\\" in Japanese, it became Moltres when Nintendo decided to give the various Pok√©mon species \\"clever and descriptive names\\" related to their appearance or features when translating the game for western audiences as a means to make the characters more relatable to American children. Moltres' English name comes from a combination of \\"molten\\", relating to lava, and tres, the Spanish word for three. Moltres is known as the Flame Pok√©mon, is a legendary Pok√©mon, one of the legendary birds, along with Articuno and Zapdos. It is a large bird that is literally ablaze with fire, resembling something related to a phoenix. Moltres has a flame-colored plumage, and its dazzling wings and elaborate head crest appear to be covered with flames. It has a straight, pointed brown break, which is the same color as its feet. It can freely create and manipulate fire, and when it flaps its wings, it creates a brilliant flash of flames.Pok√©dex: It is said to be the legendary bird Pok√©mon of fire. Every flap of its wings creates a dazzling flare of flames. If its body is injured for any reason, it will head towards a volcano and dip its body in the molten magma to heal its wounds.Pok√©dex: Moltres is a legendary bird Pok√©mon that can control fire. If injured, it is said to dip its body in the molten magma of a volcano to burn and heal itself. When Moltres thinks it is in the least bit possible danger, it will summon a flash of fire and seemingly disappear, flying out of sight very fast. Moltres appear to live in hot regions, particularly active volcanoes. It appears to migrate to the south during the springtime,Pok√©dex: Legendary bird Pok√©mon. It is said to migrate from the south along with the spring. making many believe that its appearance will bring about an early spring. Pok√©dex: One of the legendary bird Pok√©mon. It is said that spring will soon arrive if Moltres shows itself. =Appearances= In the video games The first video game appearance of Moltres was in Pok√©mon Red and Blue versions. It is a highly rare Pok√©mon; similar to its counterparts Articuno and Zapdos, Moltres appears only once in one game in a fixed location, Victory Road, and is difficult to defeat or capture. If it is defeated, it disappears. It also appeared in later core series games, including the Red and Blue remake Pok√©mon FireRed and LeafGreen, Pok√©mon HeartGold and SoulSilver, and Pok√©mon X and Y. In X and Y, it reappears if the player re-defeats the Elite Four. Outside of the main series, Moltres has appeared in the Pok√©mon Mystery Dungeon games, Pok√©mon Snap, Pok√©mon Ranger: Guardian Signs and in the Super Smash Bros. series since Melee, in which it uses Fly when summoned from a Pokeball item. In the mobile app Pok√©mon Go, Team Valor is represented by Moltres as a mascot. In Pok√©mon Sword and Shield's expansion pack, The Crown Tundra, Moltres receives a Galarian Form. This form changes it's typing from Fire and Flying to Dark and Flying. In other media The first official appearance of Moltres in the anime was in \\"All Fired Up!\\" that marks the official opening of the Pok√©mon League, where it lights the torch which is equivalent to the real-life Olympic Torch at the Olympic Games. It also plays a role in Pok√©mon The Movie 2000: The Power of One, where it was one of the three birds that the villainous collector captured to allow him access to Lugia's power, but the upset of the balance that occurred as a result nearly caused a worldwide weather catastrophe as Moltres was driven to wage war with its two rivals. In a later episode of Pok√©mon Chronicles, Ritchie encountered a trainer named Silver who wanted to capture Moltres, battling him with his Salamence. Silver is interrupted by Team Rocket members Butch and Cassidy who attempt to kidnap Moltres. Ritchie and Silver team up to defeat them and rescue Moltres, although the firebird was badly weakened by the attack. Silver let Moltres go because he wanted to catch him in a fair fight when it was at full strength. =Promotion and reception= Since appearing in Pok√©mon Red and Blue, Moltres has received mixed reception. Moltres has been featured in several pieces of merchandise, including cards in the Pok√©mon Trading Card Game, figurines, plush toys, and others. A special Moltres card was given away to those who saw the film Pok√©mon The Movie 2000. The Seattle Post-Intelligencer editor Paula Nechak compared the legendary bird trio as well as Lugia to the creatures found in Igor Stravinsky's The Firebird.

A numerically stable way to evaluate polynomials in Bernstein form is de Casteljau's algorithm. Polynomials in Bernstein form were first used by Bernstein in a constructive proof for the Weierstrass approximation theorem. With the advent of computer graphics, Bernstein polynomials, restricted to the interval [0, 1], became important in the form of B√©zier curves. Bernstein basis polynomials for 4th degree curve blending Definition The n+1 Bernstein basis polynomials of degree n are defined as : b_{ u,n}(x) = \\\\binom{n}{ u} x^{ u} \\\\left( 1 - x \\\\right)^{n - u}, \\\\quad u = 0, \\\\ldots, n, where \\\\tbinom{n}{ u} is a binomial coefficient. So, for example, b_{2,5}(x) = \\\\tbinom{5}{2}x^2(1-x)^3 = 10x^2(1-x)^3. The first few Bernstein basis polynomials for blending 1, 2, 3 or 4 values together are: : \\\\begin{align} b_{0,0}(x) & = 1, \\\\\\\\\\\\ b_{0,1}(x) & = 1 - x, & b_{1,1}(x) & = x \\\\\\\\\\\\ b_{0,2}(x) & = (1 - x)^2, & b_{1,2}(x) & = 2x(1 - x), & b_{2,2}(x) & = x^2 \\\\\\\\\\\\ b_{0,3}(x) & = (1 - x)^3, & b_{1,3}(x) & = 3x(1 - x)^2, & b_{2,3}(x) & = 3x^2(1 - x), & b_{3,3}(x) & = x^3 \\\\end{align} : The Bernstein basis polynomials of degree n form a basis for the vector space Œ†n of polynomials of degree at most n with real coefficients. A linear combination of Bernstein basis polynomials :B_n(x) = \\\\sum_{ u=0}^{n} \\\\beta_{ u} b_{ u,n}(x) is called a Bernstein polynomial or polynomial in Bernstein form of degree n. The coefficients \\\\beta_ u are called Bernstein coefficients or B√©zier coefficients. The first few Bernstein basis polynomials from above in monomial form are: : \\\\begin{align} b_{0,0}(x) & = 1, \\\\\\\\\\\\ b_{0,1}(x) & = 1 - 1x, & b_{1,1}(x) & = 0 + 1x \\\\\\\\\\\\ b_{0,2}(x) & = 1 - 2x + 1x^2, & b_{1,2}(x) & = 0 + 2x - 2x^2, & b_{2,2}(x) & = 0 + 0x + 1x^2 \\\\\\\\\\\\ b_{0,3}(x) & = 1 - 3x + 3x^2 - x^3, & b_{1,3}(x) & = 0 + 3x - 6x^2 + 3x^3, & b_{2,3}(x) & = 0 + 0x + 3x^2 - 3x^3, & b_{3,3}(x) & = 0 + 0x + 0x^2 + 1x^3 \\\\end{align} : Properties The Bernstein basis polynomials have the following properties: * b_{ u, n}(x) = 0, if u < 0 or u > n. * b_{ u, n}(x) \\\\ge 0 for x \\\\in [0,\\\\ 1]. * b_{ u, n}\\\\left( 1 - x \\\\right) = b_{n - u, n}(x). * b_{ u, n}(0) = \\\\delta_{ u, 0} and b_{ u, n}(1) = \\\\delta_{ u, n} where \\\\delta is the Kronecker delta function: \\\\delta_{ij} = \\\\begin{cases} 0 &\\\\text{if } i eq j, \\\\\\\\\\\\ 1 &\\\\text{if } i=j. \\\\end{cases} * b_{ u, n}(x) has a root with multiplicity u at point x = 0 (note: if u = 0, there is no root at 0). * b_{ u, n}(x) has a root with multiplicity \\\\left( n - u \\\\right) at point x = 1 (note: if u = n, there is no root at 1). * The derivative can be written as a combination of two polynomials of lower degree: *: b'_{ u, n}(x) = n \\\\left( b_{ u - 1, n - 1}(x) - b_{ u, n - 1}(x) \\\\right). * The transformation of the Bernstein polynomial to monomials is *: b_{ u,n}(x) = \\\\binom{n}{ u}\\\\sum_{k=0}^{n- u} \\\\binom{n- u}{k}(-1)^{n- u-k} x^{ u+k} = \\\\sum_{\\\\ell= u}^n \\\\binom{n}{\\\\ell}\\\\binom{\\\\ell}{ u}(-1)^{\\\\ell- u}x^\\\\ell, :and by the inverse binomial transformation, the reverse transformation is : x^k=\\\\sum_{i=0}^{n-k}\\\\binom{n-k}{i}\\\\frac{1}{\\\\binom{n}{i}}b_{n-i,n}(x) = \\\\frac{1}{\\\\binom{n}{k}} \\\\sum_{j=k}^n \\\\binom{j}{k}b_{j,n}(x). * The indefinite integral is given by *: \\\\int b_{ u, n}(x)dx = \\\\frac{1}{n+1} \\\\sum_{j= u+1}^{n+1} b_{j, n+1}(x). * The definite integral is constant for a given n: *: \\\\int_{0}^{1}b_{ u, n}(x)dx = \\\\frac{1}{n+1} \\\\quad\\\\ \\\\, \\\\text{for all } u = 0,1, \\\\dots, n. * If n e 0, then b_{ u, n}(x) has a unique local maximum on the interval [0,\\\\ 1] at x = \\\\frac{ u}{n}. This maximum takes the value *: u^ u n^{-n} \\\\left( n - u \\\\right)^{n - u} {n \\\\choose u}. * The Bernstein basis polynomials of degree n form a partition of unity: *: \\\\sum_{ u = 0}^n b_{ u, n}(x) = \\\\sum_{ u = 0}^n {n \\\\choose u} x^ u \\\\left(1 - x\\\\right)^{n - u} = \\\\left(x + \\\\left( 1 - x \\\\right) \\\\right)^n = 1. * By taking the first x-derivative of (x+y)^n, treating y as constant, then substituting the value y = 1-x, it can be shown that *: \\\\sum_{ u=0}^{n} u b_{ u, n}(x) = nx. * Similarly the second x-derivative of (x+y)^n, with y again then substituted y = 1-x, shows that *: \\\\sum_{ u=1}^{n} u( u-1) b_{ u, n}(x) = n(n-1)x^2. * A Bernstein polynomial can always be written as a linear combination of polynomials of higher degree: *: b_{ u, n - 1}(x) = \\\\frac{n - u}{n} b_{ u, n}(x) + \\\\frac{ u + 1}{n} b_{ u + 1, n}(x). * The expansion of the Chebyshev Polynomials of the First Kind into the Bernstein basis is *: T_n(u) = (2n-1)!!\\\\sum_{k=0}^n \\\\frac{(-1)^{n-k}}{(2k-1)!!(2n-2k-1)!!} b_{k,n}(u). Approximating continuous functions Let ∆í be a continuous function on the interval [0, 1]. Consider the Bernstein polynomial :B_n(f)(x) = \\\\sum_{ u = 0}^n f\\\\left( \\\\frac{ u}{n} \\\\right) b_{ u,n}(x). It can be shown that :\\\\lim_{n \\\\to \\\\infty}{ B_n(f) } = f uniformly on the interval [0, 1].Natanson (1964) p. 6 Bernstein polynomials thus provide one way to prove the Weierstrass approximation theorem that every real-valued continuous function on a real interval [a, b] can be uniformly approximated by polynomial functions over \\\\mathbb R.Natanson (1964) p. 3 A more general statement for a function with continuous kth derivative is :{\\\\left\\\\ B_n(f)^{(k)} \\\\right\\\\}_\\\\infty \\\\le \\\\frac{ (n)_k }{ n^k } \\\\left\\\\ f^{(k)} \\\\right\\\\_\\\\infty \\\\quad\\\\ \\\\text{and} \\\\quad\\\\ \\\\left\\\\ f^{(k)}- B_n(f)^{(k)} \\\\right\\\\_\\\\infty \\\\to 0, where additionally :\\\\frac{ (n)_k }{ n^k } = \\\\left( 1 - \\\\frac{0}{n} \\\\right) \\\\left( 1 - \\\\frac{1}{n} \\\\right) \\\\cdots \\\\left( 1 - \\\\frac{k - 1}{n} \\\\right) is an eigenvalue of Bn; the corresponding eigenfunction is a polynomial of degree k. =Probabilistic proof= This proof follows Bernstein's original proof of 1912. See also Feller (1966) or Koralov & Sinai (2007). Suppose K is a random variable distributed as the number of successes in n independent Bernoulli trials with probability x of success on each trial; in other words, K has a binomial distribution with parameters n and x. Then we have the expected value \\\\operatorname{\\\\mathcal E}\\\\left[\\\\frac{K}{n}\\\\right] = x\\\\ and :p(K) = {n \\\\choose K} x^{K} \\\\left( 1 - x \\\\right)^{n - K} = b_{K,n}(x) By the weak law of large numbers of probability theory, :\\\\lim_{n \\\\to \\\\infty}{ P\\\\left( \\\\left \\\\frac{K}{n} - x \\\\right>\\\\delta \\\\right) } = 0 for every Œ¥ > 0\\\\. Moreover, this relation holds uniformly in x, which can be seen from its proof via Chebyshev's inequality, taking into account that the variance of K, equal to x(1‚àíx), is bounded from above by irrespective of x. Because ∆í, being continuous on a closed bounded interval, must be uniformly continuous on that interval, one infers a statement of the form :\\\\lim_{n \\\\to \\\\infty}{ P\\\\left( \\\\left f\\\\left( \\\\frac{K}{n} \\\\right) - f\\\\left( x \\\\right) \\\\right > \\\\varepsilon \\\\right) } = 0 uniformly in x. Taking into account that ∆í is bounded (on the given interval) one gets for the expectation : \\\\lim_{n \\\\to \\\\infty}{ \\\\operatorname{\\\\mathcal E}\\\\left( \\\\left f\\\\left( \\\\frac{K}{n} \\\\right) - f\\\\left( x \\\\right) \\\\right \\\\right) } = 0 uniformly in x. To this end one splits the sum for the expectation in two parts. On one part the difference does not exceed Œµ; this part cannot contribute more than Œµ. On the other part the difference exceeds Œµ, but does not exceed 2M, where M is an upper bound for ∆í(x); this part cannot contribute more than 2M times the small probability that the difference exceeds Œµ. Finally, one observes that the absolute value of the difference between expectations never exceeds the expectation of the absolute value of the difference, and :\\\\operatorname{\\\\mathcal E}\\\\left[f\\\\left(\\\\frac{K}{n}\\\\right)\\\\right] = \\\\sum_{K=0}^n f\\\\left(\\\\frac{K}{n}\\\\right) p(K) = \\\\sum_{K=0}^n f\\\\left(\\\\frac{K}{n}\\\\right) b_{K,n}(x) = B_n(f)(x) = Elementary proof = The probabilistic proof can also be rephrased in an elementary way, using the underlying probabilistic ideas but proceeding by direct verification: The following identities can be verified: (1) \\\\sum_k {n \\\\choose k} x^k (1-x)^{n-k} = 1 :(\\"probability\\") (2) \\\\sum_k {k\\\\over n} {n \\\\choose k} x^k (1-x)^{n-k} = x :(\\"mean\\") (3) \\\\sum_k \\\\left( x -{k\\\\over n}\\\\right)^2 {n \\\\choose k} x^k (1-x)^{n-k} = {x(1-x)\\\\over n}. :(\\"variance\\") In fact, by the binomial theorem ::(1+t)^n = \\\\sum_k {n \\\\choose k} t^k, and this equation can be applied twice to t\\\\frac{d}{dt}. The identities (1), (2), and (3) follow easily using the substitution t = x/ (1 - x). Within these three identities, use the above basis polynomial notation : b_{k,n}(x) = {n\\\\choose k} x^k (1-x)^{n-k}, and let : f_n(x) = \\\\sum_k f(k/n)\\\\, b_{k,n}(x). Thus, by identity (1) :f_n(x) - f(x) = \\\\sum_k [f(k/n) - f(x)] \\\\,b_{k,n}(x), so that :f_n(x) - f(x) \\\\le \\\\sum_k f(k/n) - f(x) \\\\, b_{k,n}(x). Since f is uniformly continuous, given \\\\varepsilon > 0, there is a \\\\delta > 0 such that f(a) - f(b) < \\\\varepsilon whenever a-b < \\\\delta. Moreover, by continuity, M= \\\\sup f < \\\\infty. But then : f_n(x) - f(x) \\\\le \\\\sum_{x -{k\\\\over n}< \\\\delta} f(k/n) - f(x)\\\\, b_{k,n}(x) + \\\\sum_{x -{k\\\\over n}\\\\ge \\\\delta} f(k/n) - f(x)\\\\, b_{k,n}(x) . The first sum is less than Œµ. On the other hand, by identity (3) above, and since x - k/n \\\\ge \\\\delta, the second sum is bounded by 2M times :\\\\sum_{x - k/n\\\\ge \\\\delta} b_{k,n}(x) \\\\le \\\\sum_k \\\\delta^{-2} \\\\left(x -{k\\\\over n}\\\\right)^2 b_{k,n}(x) = \\\\delta^{-2} {x(1-x)\\\\over n} < \\\\delta^{-2} n^{-1}. :(\\"Chebyshev's inequality\\") It follows that the polynomials fn tend to f uniformly.  Generalizations to higher dimension  Bernstein polynomials can be generalized to dimensions. The resulting polynomials have the form . In the simplest case only products of the unit interval are considered; but, using affine transformations of the line, Bernstein polynomials can also be defined for products . For a continuous function on the -fold product of the unit interval, the proof that can be uniformly approximated by :\\\\sum_{i_1} \\\\sum_{i_2} \\\\cdots \\\\sum_{i_k} {n_1\\\\choose i_1} {n_2\\\\choose i_2} \\\\cdots {n_k\\\\choose i_k} f({i_1\\\\over n_1}, {i_2\\\\over n_2}, \\\\dots, {i_k\\\\over n_k}) x_1^{i_1} (1-x_1)^{n_1-i_1} x_2^{i_2} (1-x_2)^{n_2-i_2} \\\\cdots x_k^{i_k} (1-x_k)^{n_k - i_k} is a straightforward extension of Bernstein's proof in one dimension.

Biography John Hart was born in Mohill, County Leitrim, Ireland, the son of an Irish farmer who was also named John Hart. He came to Victoria in 1898. Hart worked in the finance industry and founded his own firm in 1909. In 1908, he married Harriet McKay. He entered politics in the 1916 election, elected to the provincial legislature as a Liberal member from Victoria City. He served as minister of finance from 1917 to 1924, and from 1933 to 1947. Hart retired from politics to attend to his business from 1924 to 1933. Hart became premier following the 1941 election when Pattullo's Liberals failed to win a majority. Unlike Pattullo, Hart was willing to form a coalition government with the Conservative Party. This allowed the Liberal-Conservative Coalition to govern with a majority in order to block the socialist Cooperative Commonwealth Federation from forming the government. From 1941 to 1945, Hart governed at a time of wartime scarcity, when all major government projects were postponed. Hart's coalition government was re-elected in the 1945 election by a decisive margin. In that contest, Liberals and Conservatives ran under the same banner for the first time in BC history. After 1945, Hart undertook an ambitious program of rural electrification, hydroelectric and highway construction. Hart's most significant projects were the construction of Highway 97 to northern British Columbia (which is named in his honour) and the re-launch of the Bridge River Power Project, which was the first major hydroelectric development in British Columbia. He established the BC Power Commission, a forerunner of BC Hydro, to provide power to smaller communities that were not serviced by private utilities. In December 1947, he retired as both finance minister and premier. Hart was named speaker for the assembly in 1948. He did not seek reelection in 1949 and returned to business. Hart was one of the few BC premiers who left office neither defeated nor under a cloud. He died in Victoria in 1957, aged 78 years, having led a distinguished life of public service. He is interred in the Royal Oak Burial Park in Saanich. The 405 km John Hart Highway between Prince George and Dawson Creek is named for him, as is the Hart Highlands neighbourhood of Prince George and the John Hart Dam (Hydroelectric) in Campbell River.

It is one of four living species of anteaters, the only extant member of the genus Myrmecophaga, and is classified with sloths in the order Pilosa. This species is mostly terrestrial, in contrast to other living anteaters and sloths, which are arboreal or semiarboreal. The giant anteater is the biggest of its family, in length, with weights of for males and for females. It is recognizable by its elongated snout, bushy tail, long fore claws, and distinctively colored pelage. The giant anteater is found in multiple habitats, including grassland and rainforest. It forages in open areas and rests in more forested habitats. It feeds primarily on ants and termites, using its fore claws to dig them up and its long, sticky tongue to collect them. Though giant anteaters live in overlapping home ranges, they are mostly solitary except during mother- offspring relationships, aggressive interactions between males, and when mating. Mother anteaters carry their offspring on their backs until weaning them. The giant anteater is listed as vulnerable by the International Union for Conservation of Nature. It has been extirpated from many parts of its former range. Threats to its survival include habitat destruction, fire, and poaching for fur and bushmeat, although some anteaters inhabit protected areas. With its distinctive appearance and habits, the anteater has been featured in pre-Columbian myths and folktales, as well as modern popular culture. Taxonomy and phylogeny The giant anteater got its binomial name from Carl Linnaeus in 1758. Its generic name, Myrmecophaga, and specific name, tridactyla, are both Greek, meaning \\"anteater\\" and \\"three fingers\\", respectively. Myrmecophaga jubata was used as a synonym. Three subspecies have been tentatively proposed: M. t. tridactyla (ranging from Venezuela and the Guianas to northern Argentina), M. t. centralis (native to Central America, northwestern Colombia, and northern Ecuador), and M. t. artata (native to northeastern Colombia and northwestern Venezuela). The giant anteater is grouped with the semiarboreal northern and southern tamanduas in the family Myrmecophagidae. Together with the family Cyclopedidae, whose only extant member is the arboreal silky anteater, the two families comprise the suborder Vermilingua. Anteaters and sloths belong to order Pilosa and share superorder Xenarthra with the Cingulata (whose only extant members are armadillos). The two orders of Xenarthra split 66 million years ago (Mya) during the Late Cretaceous epoch. Anteaters and sloths diverged around 55 Mya, between the Paleocene and Eocene epochs. The Cyclopes lineage emerged around 30 Mya in the Oligocene epoch, while the Myrmecophaga and Tamandua lineages split 10 Mya in the Late Miocene subepoch. During most of the Cenozoic era, anteaters were confined to South America, which was formerly an island continent. Following the formation of the Isthmus of Panama about 3 Mya, anteaters of all three extant genera invaded Central America as part of the Great American Interchange. The fossil record for anteaters is generally sparse. Known fossils include the Pliocene genus Palaeomyrmidon, a close relative to the silky anteater, Protamandua, the sister taxon to the clade that includes the giant anteater and the tamanduas from the Miocene, and Neotamandua, a sister taxon to Myrmecophaga. Protamandua was larger than the silky anteater, but smaller than a tamandua, while Neotamandua was larger, falling somewhere between a tamandua and a giant anteater. Protamandua did not appear to have feet specialized for terrestrial or arboreal locomotion, but it may have had a prehensile tail. Neotamandua, though, is unlikely to have had a prehensile tail and its feet were intermediate in form between those of the tamanduas and the giant anteater. The species Neotamandua borealis was suggested to be an ancestor of the latter. Another member of the genus Myrmecophaga has been recovered from the Montehermosan Monte Hermoso Formation in Argentina and was described by Kraglievitch in 1934 as Nunezia caroloameghinoi.Nunezia caroloameghinoi at Fossilworks.org The species was reclassified as Myrmecophaga caroloameghinoi by S. E. Hirschfeld in 1976. The giant anteater is the most terrestrial of the living anteater species. Its ancestors may originally have been adapted to arboreal life; the transition to life on the ground could have been aided by the expansion of open habitats such as savanna in South America and the availability there of colonial insects, such as termites, that provided a larger potential food source. Both the giant anteater and the southern tamandua are well represented in the fossil record of the late Pleistocene and early Holocene.  Characteristics  The giant anteater can be identified by its large size, elongated muzzle, and long bushy tail. It has a total body length of . Males weigh and females weigh , making the giant anteater the biggest extant species in its suborder. The head of the giant anteater, at long, is particularly elongated, even when compared to other anteaters. Its tubular snout, which ends in its tiny mouth opening and nostrils, takes up most of its head. Its eyes and ears are relatively small. It has poor eyesight, but its sense of smell is 40 times more sensitive than that of humans. Giant anteaters can live around 16 years in captivity. Even for an anteater, the neck is especially thick compared to the back of the head, and a small hump is found at the back of the neck. The coat is mostly greyish, brown or black and salted with white. The forelimbs are white, with black bands around the wrists, while the hindlimbs are dark. Thick black bands with white outlines stretch from throat to shoulder, ending in triangular points. The body ends in a brown tail. The coat hairs are long, especially on the tail, which makes the tail look larger than it actually is. A stiff mane stretches along the back. The bold pattern was thought to be disruptive camouflage, but a 2009 study suggests it is warning coloration. While adult males are slightly larger and more muscular than females, with wider heads and necks, visual sex determination can be difficult. The penis and testes are located internally between the rectum and urinary bladder in males, and females have a single pair of mammary glands near the armpits. The giant anteater has broad ribs. Despite its specific name, tridactyla, meaning three fingers, it has five toes on each foot. Four toes on the front feet have claws, which are particularly elongated on the second and third digits. It walks on its front knuckles similar to gorillas and chimpanzees. Doing this allows the giant anteater to keep its claws out of the way while walking. The middle digits, which support most of its weight, are extended at the metacarpophalangeal joints and bent at the interphalangeal joints. Unlike the front feet, the hind feet have short claws on all five toes and walk plantigrade. As a \\"hook-and-pull\\" digger, the giant anteater's enlarged supraspinous fossa gives the teres major more leverage‚Äîincreasing the front limbs' pulling power‚Äîand the triceps muscle helps power the flexion of the thickened third digit of the front feet. The giant anteater has a low body temperature for a mammal, about , a few degrees lower than a typical mammalian temperature of . Xenarthrans in general tend to have lower metabolic rates than most other mammals, a trend thought to correlate with their dietary specializations and low mobility. = Feeding anatomy = Anteater with tongue extended The giant anteater has no teeth and is capable of only very limited jaw movement. It relies on the rotation of the two halves of its lower jaw, held together by a ligament at the tip, to open and close its mouth. This is accomplished by its masticatory muscles, which are relatively underdeveloped. Jaw depression creates an oral opening large enough for the slender tongue to flick out. It is typically long and is triangular posteriorly, rounded anteriorly, and ends in a small, rounded tip. The tongue is covered in backward-curving papillae and coated in thick, sticky saliva secreted from its enlarged salivary glands, which allows the giant anteater to collect insects with it. The tube-like rostrum and small mouth opening restrict the tongue to protrusion-retraction movements. During feeding, the animal relies on the orientation of its head for aim. The tongue can reach up to , longer than the length of the skull, and move in and out around 160 times per minute (nearly three times per second). The anteater's tongue has little to no attachments to the hyoid and this is what allows it to flick its tongue at such distances and speed. The long sternoglossus muscle, which is formed by the fusion of the sternohyoid and the hyoglossus, is directly anchored to the sternum. The hyoid apparatus is large, V-shaped and flexible and supports the tongue as it goes in and out of the mouth. The buccinators allow it to slide back in without losing attached food and tighten the mouth to prevent food from escaping as it extends. When retracted, the tongue is held in the oropharynx by the secondary palate, preventing it from blocking respiration. Giant anteaters swallow at a much higher rate than most other mammals; when feeding, they swallow almost continuously. Before being swallowed, insects are crushed against the palate. The giant anteater's stomach, similar to a bird's gizzard, has hardened folds and uses strong contractions to grind up the insects. The digestive process is assisted by small amounts of ingested sand and soil. The giant anteater cannot produce stomach acid of its own, but uses the formic acid of its prey for digestion.  Distribution and status  In the grasslands of Serra da Canastra National Park, Brazil The giant anteater is native to Central and South America. Its known range stretches from Honduras to northern Argentina, and fossil remains have been found as far north as northwestern Sonora, Mexico. It is largely absent from the Andes and has been extirpated in Uruguay. It may also be extirpated in Belize, Costa Rica, and Guatemala. The species is found in a number of habitats including both tropical rainforest and xeric shrubland, provided enough prey is present to sustain it. The species is listed as Vulnerable by the IUCN, due to the number of regional extirpations, and under Appendix II by CITES, tightly restricting trade in specimens of the animal. Between 2000 and 2010, the total population declined by 30%. In 1994, some 340 giant anteaters died due to wildfires at Emas National Park in Brazil. The animal is particularly vulnerable to fires due to its slow movement and flammable coat. Human-induced threats include collision with vehicles, attacks by dogs, and destruction of habitat. The giant anteater is commonly hunted in Bolivia, both for sport and sustenance. The animal's thick, leathery hide is used to make equestrian equipment in the Chaco. In Venezuela, it is hunted for its claws. Giant anteaters are killed for safety reasons, due to their reputation as dangerous animals. The giant anteater remains widespread. Some populations are stable and the animal is found in various protected areas in the Amazon, Pantanal and the Cerrado. It is officially protected in some Argentine provinces as a national heritage species.  Behavior and ecology  Sleeping under its tail The giant anteater may use multiple habitats. A 2007 study of giant anteaters in the Brazilian Pantanal found the animals generally forage in open areas and rest in forested areas, possibly because forests are warmer than grasslands on cold days and cooler on hot days. Giant anteaters can be either diurnal or nocturnal. A 2006 study in the Pantanal found those anteaters to be mostly nocturnal: they are most active during nighttime and early morning, and retire as the temperature rises. On colder days, they start and end periods of activity earlier, shifting them into daylight hours, and may become diurnal. Diurnal giant anteaters have been observed at Serra da Canastra. Nocturnality in anteaters may be a response to human disturbances. Giant anteaters typically rest in dense brush, but may use tall grass on cooler days. They carve a shallow cavity in the ground for resting. The animal sleeps curled up with its bushy tail folded over its body. The tail serves both to conserve body heat and as camouflage. One anteater was recorded sleeping with its tail stretched out on a sunny morning with an ambient temperature of ; possibly it was positioned this way to allow its body to absorb the sun's rays for warmth. Giant anteaters are good swimmers and are capable of moving through wide rivers. They have been observed to bathe. They are also able to climb and have been recorded ascending both termite mounds and trees while foraging. One individual was observed holding onto a branch with its feet just touching the ground. = Spacing = Two captive anteaters. The species is generally solitary in the wild. Giant anteaters' home ranges vary in size depending on the location. At Serra da Canastra National Park in Brazil, female anteaters have home ranges around , while males live in home ranges of . In other parts of Brazil, anteaters may have ranges. Anteaters from Venezuela have been recorded living in home ranges as large as . Individuals mostly live alone, except for females that nurse their young and males courting females. Anteaters communicate their presence, status, and sexual condition with secretions from their anal glands. They also advertise their presence to other individuals though tree markings and urine. They appear to be able to recognize each other's saliva by scent. Females appear to be more tolerant of females than males are of males, leading to greater overlap in female home ranges. Males are more likely to engage in agonistic behaviors, such as slowly circling each other, chasing, or actual fighting. Circling anteaters may cry a drawn-out \\"harrr\\". In combat, they slash at each other with their claws and wrestle each other to the ground. Fighting anteaters may emit roars or bellows. Males are possibly territorial. = Foraging and predation = Foraging This animal is an insectivore, feeding mostly on ants or termites. In areas that experience seasonal flooding, like the grassy plains of the Venezuelan-Colombian Llanos, anteaters mainly feed on ants, because termites are less available. Conversely, anteaters at Emas National Park eat mainly termites, which occur in high density on the grasslands. At Serra da Canastra, anteaters switch between eating mainly ants during the wet season (October to March) and termites during the dry season (May to September). Anteaters track prey by their scent. After finding a nest, the animal tears it open with its long fore claws and inserts its long, sticky tongue to collect its prey. An anteater spends one minute on average feeding at a nest, visiting up to 200 nests in one day and consuming as many as 30,000 insects. The anteater may be driven away from a nest by the chemical or biting attacks of soldiers. Some termite species rely on their fortified mounds for protection and many individuals escape while the predator digs. These modes of defense prevent the entire colony from being eaten in one anteater attack. Other prey include the larvae of beetles and western honey bees that have located their hives in termite mounds. Anteaters may target termite mounds with bee hives. In captivity, anteaters are fed mixtures made of milk, eggs, mealworms, and ground beef. To drink, an anteater may dig for water when no surface water is available, creating waterholes for other animals. Giant anteaters are primarily prey for jaguars and pumas. They typically flee from danger by galloping, but if cornered, will rear up on their hind legs and slash at the attacker. The front claws of the giant anteater are formidable weapons, capable of killing a jaguar. The giant anteater is a host of the Acanthocephalan intestinal parasites Gigantorhynchus echinodiscus and Moniliformis monoechinus. = Reproduction and parenting = Adult with offspring clinging to her back Giant anteaters can mate throughout the year. During courtship, a male consorts with an estrous female, following and sniffing her. Male and female pairs are known to feed at the same insect nest. While mating, the female lies on her side as the male crouches over her. A couple may stay together for up to three days and mate several times during that period. Gestation lasts around 190 days and ends with the birth of a single pup, which typically weighs around . Females give birth standing upright. Pups are born with eyes closed and begin to open them after six days. The mother carries its dependent pup on its back. The pup's black and white band aligns with its mother's, camouflaging it. The young communicate with their mothers with sharp whistles and use their tongues during nursing. After three months, the pup begins to eat solid food and is fully weaned by ten months. The mother grooms her offspring during rest periods lasting up to an hour. Grooming peaks during the first three months and declines as the young reaches nine months of age, ending by ten months. The decline mirrors that of the weakening bond between mother and offspring; young anteaters usually become independent by nine or ten months. Anteaters are sexually mature in 2.5‚Äì4 years.  Interactions with humans  Although they are shy and typically attempt to avoid humans, giant anteaters can inflict severe wounds with their front claws and have been known to seriously injure or kill humans who corner and threaten them. Between 2010 and 2012, two hunters were killed by giant anteaters in Brazil; in both cases, the hunters were agitating and wounding cornered animals and the attacks appeared to be defensive behaviors. In April 2007, an anteater at the Florencio Varela Zoo mauled and killed a zookeeper with its front claws. The animal in question, a male named Ramon, had a reputation for aggressiveness. = In culture = Kayapo boys in their ceremonies In the mythology and folklore of the indigenous peoples of the Amazon Basin, the giant anteater is depicted as a trickster foil to the jaguar, as well as a humorous figure due to its long snout. In one Shipib tale, an anteater challenged a jaguar to a breath-holding contest under water, which the jaguar accepted. After the two removed their pelts and submerged, the anteater jumped out of the water and stole the jaguar's pelt, leaving the jaguar with the anteater's pelt. In a Yarabara myth, the evil ogre Ucara is transformed into one by the sun. This myth emphasizes the nearly immobile nature of the anteater's mouth, which was considered a burden. The Kayapo people wear masks of various animals and spirits, including the anteater, during naming and initiation ceremonies. They believe women who touched anteater masks or men who stumbled while wearing them would die or receive some sort of physical disorder. During the Spanish colonization of the Americas, the giant anteater was one of many native fauna taken to Europe for display. At first, Europeans believed all anteaters were female and mated with their noses, a misconception corrected by naturalist F√©lix de Azara. In the 20th century, Salvador Dal√≠ wrote imaginatively that the giant anteater \\"reaches sizes bigger than the horse, possesses enormous ferocity, has exceptional muscle power, is a terrifying animal.\\" Dal√≠ depicted an anteater in the style of The Great Masturbator. It was used as a bookplate for Andr√© Breton, who compared the temptations a man experiences in life to what \\"the tongue of the anteater must offer to the ant.\\" The 1940 Max Fleischer cartoon Ants in the Plants features a colony of ants fighting off a villainous anteater. Released during the Phoney War, the film may have alluded to France's Maginot Line. An anteater is also a recurring character in the comic strip B.C.. This character was the inspiration for Peter the Anteater, the University of California, Irvine team mascot. In the Stephen King miniseries Kingdom Hospital, the character Antubis appears in the form of an anteater- like creature with razor-sharp teeth.

Origins according to ancient authors Their first mention is by Homer, in his list of Trojans allies in the Iliad, and according to whom the Mysians fought in the Trojan War on the side of Troy, under the command of Chromis and Ennomus the Augur, and were lion- hearted spearmen who fought with their bare hands. Herodotus in his Histories wrote that the Mysians were brethren of the Carians and the Lydians, originally Lydian colonists in their country, and as such, they had the right to worship alongside their relative nations in the sanctuary dedicated to the Carian Zeus in Mylasa. He also mentions a movement of Mysians and associated peoples from Asia into Europe still earlier than the Trojan War, wherein the Mysians and Teucrians had crossed the Bosphorus into Europe and, after conquering all of Thrace, pressed forward till they came to the Ionian Sea, while southward they reached as far as the river Peneus. Herodotus adds an account and description of later Mysians who fought in Darius' army. Strabo in his Geographica informs that, according to his sources, the Mysians in accordance with their religion abstained from eating any living thing, including from their flocks, and that they used as food honey and milk and cheese. Citing the historian Xanthus, he also reports that the name of the people was derived from the Lydian name for the oxya tree. Mysian language Little is known about the Mysian language. Strabo noted that their language was, in a way, a mixture of the Lydian and Phrygian languages. As such, the Mysian language could be a language of the Anatolian group. However, a passage in Athenaeus suggests that the Mysian language was akin to the barely attested Paeonian language of Paeonia, north of Macedon. A short inscription which could be in Mysian and which dates from between the 5th and 3rd centuries BC was found in √úy√ºcek, near K√ºtahya, and seems to include Indo-European words, but it has not been deciphered.

British Museum. Prusias I Cholus (Greek: Œ†œÅŒøœÖœÉŒØŒ±œÇ ·ΩÅ ŒßœâŒªœåœÇ \\"the Lame\\") (lived c. 243 - 182 BC, reigned c. 228 - 182 BC) was a king of Bithynia, the son of Ziaelas of Bithynia. Life and Reign Prusias was a vigorous and energetic leader; he fought a war against Byzantium (220 BC), seizing its Asiatic territory, a part of Mysia that had been in its possession for a long time. Then, he defeated the Galatians who Nicomedes I had invited across the Bosphorus to a territory called Arisba, putting to death all of their women and children and letting his men plunder their baggage. At some point during his reign, he formed a marriage alliance with Demetrius II of Macedon, receiving the latter's daughter, Apama III, as his wife. He expanded the territories of Bithynia in a series of wars against Attalus I of Pergamum and Heraclea Pontica on the Black Sea, taking various cities formerly owned by the Heracleans, renaming one them, Prusias, after himself. While besieging the city of Heraclea Pontica, he dealt many casualties to the besieged, but while climbing a ladder, he was hit with a stone and he broke his leg; the siege was lifted due to his injury. This is likely where he was given the surname \\"the lame\\". Philip V of Macedon granted him the ports of Keios and Myrleia in 202 BC, which he renamed Prusias and Apameia respectively. Although he granted sanctuary to Hannibal, who successfully employed an odd stratagem against the Attalids for him at sea, he remained neutral during the Roman Republic's war with Antiochus III the Great, refusing an alliance with Antiochus. He agreed on peace terms with presumably Eumenes II in 183 BC, in the city of Cyzicus. Apama III bore Prusias I a son called Prusias II, who succeeded him. The town of Prusa (now Bursa in Turkey), which he rebuilt, is named after Prusias. Sources * Habicht, Christian, s.v. Prusias I., RE.

He was the son and successor of Prusias I and Apama III. Life Prusias was born to Prusias I and Apama III in 220 BC. His father died in 189 BC, at which point he became the king of Bithynia. Prusias II joined with the king of Pergamon, Eumenes II in a war against King Pharnaces I of Pontus (181‚Äì179 BC). He later invaded the territories of Pergamon (156‚Äì154 BC), only to be defeated, with Pergamon insisting on heavy reparations, including 500 talents and \\"twenty decked ships\\".

It is weaker than uniform convergence, to which it is often compared. Definition Suppose (f_n) is a sequence of functions sharing the same domain and codomain. The codomain is most commonly the reals, but in general can be any metric space. The sequence (f_n) converges pointwise to the function f, often written as :\\\\lim_{n\\\\rightarrow\\\\infty}f_n=f\\\\ \\\\mbox{pointwise}, if and only if :\\\\lim_{n\\\\rightarrow\\\\infty}f_n(x)=f(x) for every x in the domain. The function f is said to be the pointwise limit function of f_n. Properties This concept is often contrasted with uniform convergence. To say that :\\\\lim_{n\\\\rightarrow\\\\infty}f_n=f\\\\ \\\\mbox{uniformly} means that :\\\\lim_{n\\\\rightarrow\\\\infty}\\\\,\\\\sup\\\\\\\\{\\\\,\\\\leftf_n(x)-f(x)\\\\right: x \\\\in A \\\\,\\\\\\\\}=0, where A is the common domain of f and f_n. That is a stronger statement than the assertion of pointwise convergence: every uniformly convergent sequence is pointwise convergent, to the same limiting function, but some pointwise convergent sequences are not uniformly convergent. For example, if f_n:[0,1)\\\\rightarrow[0,1) is a sequence of functions defined by f_n(x)=x^n, then \\\\lim_{n\\\\rightarrow\\\\infty} f_n(x)=0 pointwise on the interval [0,1), but not uniformly. The pointwise limit of a sequence of continuous functions may be a discontinuous function, but only if the convergence is not uniform. For example, :f(x)=\\\\lim_{n\\\\rightarrow\\\\infty} \\\\cos (\\\\pi x)^{2n} takes the value 1 when x is an integer and 0 when x is not an integer, and so is discontinuous at every integer. The values of the functions fn need not be real numbers, but may be in any topological space, in order that the concept of pointwise convergence make sense. Uniform convergence, on the other hand, does not make sense for functions taking values in topological spaces generally, but makes sense for functions taking values in metric spaces, and, more generally, in uniform spaces. Topology Pointwise convergence is the same as convergence in the product topology on the space YX, where X is the domain and Y is the codomain. If the codomain Y is compact, then, by Tychonoff's theorem, the space YX is also compact. Almost everywhere convergence In measure theory, one talks about almost everywhere convergence of a sequence of measurable functions defined on a measurable space. That means pointwise convergence almost everywhere, i.e. on a subset of the domain whose complement has measure zero. Egorov's theorem states that pointwise convergence almost everywhere on a set of finite measure implies uniform convergence on a slightly smaller set. Almost everywhere pointwise convergence on the space of functions on a measure space does not define the structure of a topology on the space of measurable functions on a measure space (although it is a convergence structure). For in a topological space, when every subsequence of a sequence has itself a subsequence with the same subsequential limit, the sequence itself must converge to that limit. But consider the sequence of so-called \\"galloping rectangles\\" functions. Let N = Floor(log2 n) and k = n mod 2N. And let :f_n(x)=\\\\begin{cases} 1, & \\\\frac{k}{2^N} \\\\leq x \\\\leq \\\\frac{k+1}{2^N} \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0, & \\\\text{otherwise}. \\\\end{cases}. Then any subsequence of the sequence has a sub-subsequence which itself converges almost everywhere to zero, for example, the subsequence of functions which do not vanish at . But at no point does the original sequence converge pointwise to zero. Hence, unlike convergence in measure and Lp convergence, pointwise convergence almost everywhere is not the convergence of any topology on the space of functions.

Soundproofing is any means of reducing the sound pressure with respect to a specified sound source and receptor. There are several basic approaches to reducing sound: increasing the distance between source and receiver, using noise barriers to reflect or absorb the energy of the sound waves, using damping structures such as sound baffles, or using active antinoise sound generators. There are 5 elements in sound reduction (Absorption, Damping, Decoupling, Distance, and Adding Mass). The \\"Absorption\\" aspect in soundproofing should not be confused with Sound Absorbing Panels used in acoustic treatments. \\"Absorption\\" in this sense only refers to reducing a resonating frequency in a cavity by installing insulation between walls, ceilings or floors. Acoustic Panels can play a role in a treatment only after walls or ceilings have been soundproofed, reducing the amplified reflection in the source room. Two distinct soundproofing problems may need to be considered when designing acoustic treatments‚Äîto improve the sound within a room (see reverberation), and reduce sound leakage to/from adjacent rooms or outdoors (see sound transmission class and sound reduction index). Acoustic quieting and noise control can be used to limit unwanted noise. Soundproofing can suppress unwanted indirect sound waves such as reflections that cause echoes and resonances that cause reverberation. Soundproofing can reduce the transmission of unwanted direct sound waves from the source to an involuntary listener through the use of distance and intervening objects in the sound path. Absorption Sound absorbing material controls reverberant sound pressure levels within a cavity, enclosure or room. Synthetic Absorption materials are porous, referring to open cell foam (acoustic foam, soundproof foam). Fibrous absorption material such as cellulose, mineral wool, fiberglass, sheep‚Äôs wool, are more commonly used to deaden resonant frequencies within a cavity (wall, floor, or ceiling insulation), serving a dual purpose for their thermal insulation properties. Both fibrous and porous absorption material are used to create acoustic panels, which absorb sound reflection in a room, improving speech intelligibility. =Porous absorbers= Porous absorbers, typically open cell rubber foams or melamine sponges, absorb noise by friction within the cell structure. Porous open cell foams are highly effective noise absorbers across a broad range of medium-high frequencies. Performance can be less impressive at lower frequencies. The exact absorption profile of a porous open-cell foam will be determined by a number of factors including the following: * Cell size * Tortuosity * Porosity * Material thickness * Material density =Resonant absorbers= Resonant panels, Helmholtz resonators and other resonant absorbers work by damping a sound wave as they reflect it. Unlike porous absorbers, resonant absorbers are most effective at low-medium frequencies and the absorption of resonant absorbers is always matched to a narrow frequency range. Damping Damping means to reduce resonance in the room, by absorption or redirection (reflection or diffusion). Absorption will reduce the overall sound level, whereas redirection makes unwanted sound harmless or even beneficial by reducing coherence. Damping can reduce the acoustic resonance in the air, or mechanical resonance in the structure of the room itself or things in the room. Decoupling Creating separation between a sound source and any form of adjoining mass, hindering the direct pathway for sound transfer. Decoupling a wall involves the use of Resilient Isolation Clips or Sound Damping Pads. The clips should be staggered when installed (every other stud) to create fewer pathways for sound to transfer. The Resilient Isolation Channel easily clicks into the Resilient Clips, resulting in a 1 5/8‚Äù gap between the stud and drywall. Fine thread screws are used to screw the drywall into the Resilient Channel. Screws should be the correct length in order to not pierce a stud, this will compromise the efficiency of the decoupled wall. Distance The energy density of sound waves decreases as they become farther apart, so that increasing the distance between the receiver and source results in a progressively lesser intensity of sound at the receiver. In a normal three- dimensional setting, with a point source and point receptor, the intensity of sound waves will be attenuated according to the inverse square of the distance from the source. Mass Adding dense material to a treatment in order to stop sound waves from exiting a source wall, ceiling or floor. Use of Mass Loaded Vinyl, Drywall, Soundproof Sheetrock, Plywood, MDF, Concrete or Rubber. Different widths and densities in soundproofing material reduces sound within a variable frequency range. Use of multiple layers of material is essential to the success in any treatment. Reflection When sound waves hit a medium, the reflection of that sound is dependent on dissimilarity of the surfaces it comes in contact with. Sound hitting a concrete surface will result in a much different reflection than if the sound were to hit a softer medium such as fiberglass. In an outdoor environment such as highway engineering, embankments or paneling are often used to reflect sound upwards into the sky. Diffusion If a specular reflection from a hard flat surface is giving a problematic echo then an acoustic diffuser may be applied to the surface. It will scatter sound in all directions. This is effective to eliminate pockets of noise in a room. Noise cancellation Noise cancellation generators for active noise control are a relatively modern innovation. A microphone is used to pick up the sound that is then analyzed by a computer; then, sound waves with opposite polarity (180¬∞ phase at all frequencies) are output through a speaker, causing destructive interference and canceling much of the noise.  Residential Soundproofing  Residential Sound Programs aims to decrease or eliminate the effects of exterior noise. The main focus of the residential sound program in existing structures is the windows and doors. Solid wood doors are a better sound barrier than hollow doors. Curtains can be used to dampen sound, either through use of heavy materials or through the use of air chambers known as honeycombs. Single-, double- and triple-honeycomb designs achieve relatively greater degrees of sound damping. The primary soundproofing limit of curtains is the lack of a seal at the edge of the curtain, although this may be alleviated with the use of sealing features, such as hook and loop fastener, adhesive, magnets, or other materials. The thickness of glass will play a role when diagnosing sound leakage. Double-pane windows achieve somewhat greater sound damping than single-pane windows when well sealed into the opening of the window frame and wall. Significant noise reduction can also be achieved by installing a second interior window. In this case, the exterior window remains in place while a slider or hung window is installed within the same wall openings. In the USA the FAA offers sound-reducing for homes that fall within a noise contour where the average decibel level is 65 decibels. It is part of their Residential Sound Insulation Program. The program provides Solid-core wood entry doors plus windows and storm doors.  Ceiling Soundproofing  *Apartment Ceiling Soundproofing, Soundproof Sheetrock, Resilient Isolation Channel, Viscoelastic Compound, Sound Proof InsulationSealing gaps and cracks around electrical wiring, water pipes and ductwork using acoustical caulk or spray foam will significantly reduce unwanted noise as a preliminary step for ceiling soundproofing. * Mineral Wool Insulation is most commonly used in soundproofing for its density and low cost in comparison to other soundproofing material. Spray foam insulation should only be used to fill gaps and cracks or as a 1-2 inch layer before installing mineral wool. When spray foam (also referred to as closed-cell foam) cures it can become a sound conductor. Spray foam is not porous enough to absorb sound, it's also not dense enough to stop sound. * An effective method to reduce impact noise is the Resilient Isolation Channel. The channels decouple the drywall from the joists, reducing the transfer of vibration. Screws anchor the channels into the ceiling joist, staggering every other joist. The Channels rest 1/2\\" off the joist, using Resilient Isolation Clips or a rubber damping pad. After installation, impact vibration has minimal ways to transfer through the channels to the new drywall installation. *When finishing the ceiling, acoustical caulk should be used along the perimeter of the wall to further seal the treatment. Avoid recessed lights or any fixtures requiring large holes in the ceiling. One small hole can compromise the efficiency of the entire treatment. Use acoustical caulk to seal around all fixtures and duct registers.  Wall Soundproofing  *Outlets, light switches, and electrical boxes are weak points in any given soundproofing treatment. Electrical boxes should be wrapped in clay or putty and backed with MLV. After switch plates, outlet covers and lights are installed, acoustical caulking should be applied around the perimeter of the plates or fixtures. *Mass is the only way to stop sound. Mass refers to drywall, plywood or concrete. MLV (Mass Loaded Vinyl) is used to damp or weaken sound waves between layers of mass. Use of a Viscoelastic Damping Compound or MLV converts sound waves into heat, weakening the waves before reaching the next layer of mass. * Walls are filled with Mineral Wool Insulation. Depending on the desired level of treatment, 2 layers of insulation may be required. Using Resilient Isolation Clips aids in the decoupling process for both wall and ceiling soundproofing treatments. After the clips are installed, the Resilient Isolation Channel easily clicks into the clips. *Installing soundproof drywall is recommended for its higher STC value. Soundproof drywall in combination with a viscoelastic compound may achieve a noise reduction of STC 60+. It's important to use multiple layers of mass, in different widths and density, to optimize any given soundproofing treatment.  Floor Soundproofing  Leaving a gap between the joist and subfloor plywood is the most efficient way to install soundproof flooring. Neoprene joist tape or u-shaped rubber spacers help decouple the subfloor from the joist. An additional layer of plywood can be installed with a viscoelastic compound. Mass Loaded Vinyl, in combination with open-cell rubber or a closed- cell foam floor underlayment, will further reduce sound transmission. After applying these techniques, hardwood flooring or carpeting can be installed. Additional area rugs and furniture will help reduce unwanted reflection within the room.  Room within a room  A room within a room (RWAR) is one method of isolating sound and preventing it from transmitting to the outside world where it may be undesirable. Most vibration / sound transfer from a room to the outside occurs through mechanical means. The vibration passes directly through the brick, woodwork and other solid structural elements. When it meets with an element such as a wall, ceiling, floor or window, which acts as a sounding board, the vibration is amplified and heard in the second space. A mechanical transmission is much faster, more efficient and maybe more readily amplified than an airborne transmission of the same initial strength. The use of acoustic foam and other absorbent means is less effective against this transmitted vibration. The user is advised to break the connection between the room that contains the noise source and the outside world. This is called acoustic decoupling. Ideal decoupling involves eliminating vibration transfer in both solid materials and in the air, so air-flow into the room is often controlled. This has safety implications: inside decoupled space, proper ventilation must be assured, and gas heaters cannot be used. Commercial Soundproofing Restaurants, schools, office businesses, and health care facilities use architectural acoustics to reduce noise for their customers. In the US, OSHA has requirements regulating the length of exposure of workers to certain levels of noise. Commercial businesses sometimes use soundproofing technology, especially when they are an open office design. There are many reasons why a business might implement soundproofing for their office. One of the biggest hindrances in worker productivity is the distracting noises that come from people talking such as on the phone, or with their co-workers and boss. Noise soundproofing is important in mitigating people from losing their concentration and focus from their work project. It is also important to keep confidential conversations secure to the intended listeners. When trying to find places to install soundproofing, acoustic panels should be installed in office areas where many traffic corridors, circulation pathways, and open work areas are connected. Successful acoustic panel installations rely on three strategies and techniques to absorb sound, block sound transmission from one place to another, and cover and masking of the sound, positioned to avoid other services or block light.  Automotive Soundproofing  Automotive soundproofing aims to decrease or eliminate the effects of exterior noise, primarily engine, exhaust and tire noise across a wide frequency range. When constructing a vehicle which includes soundproofing, a panel damping material is fitted which reduces the vibration of the vehicle's body panels when they are excited by one of the many high energy sound sources caused when the vehicle is in use. There are many complex noises created within vehicles which change with the driving environment and speed at which the vehicle travels. Significant noise reductions of up to 8 dB can be achieved by installing a combination of different types of materials. Spatially averaged particle velocity spectra (left) and broadband colormaps of a car floor without (middle) and with (right) a damping treatment. The automotive environment limits the thickness of materials that can be used, but combinations of dampers, barriers, and absorbers are common. Common materials include felt, foam, polyester, and Polypropylene blend materials. Waterproofing may be necessary based on materials used. Acoustic foam can be applied in different areas of a vehicle during manufacture to reduce cabin noise. Foams also have cost and performance advantages in installation since foam material can expand and fill cavities after application and also prevent leaks and some gases from entering the vehicle. Vehicle soundproofing can reduce wind, engine, road, and tire noise. Vehicle soundproofing can reduce sound inside a vehicle from five to 20 decibels. Surface damping materials are very effective at reducing structure-borne noise. Passive damping materials have been used since the early 1960s in the aerospace industry. Over the years, advances in material manufacturing and the development of more efficient analytical and experimental tools to characterize complex dynamic behaviors enabled to expand the usage of these materials to the automotive industry. Nowadays, multiple viscoelastic damping pads are usually attached to the body in order to attenuate higher-order structural panel modes that significantly contribute to the overall noise level inside the cabin. Traditionally, experimental techniques are used to optimize the size and location of damping treatments. In particular, laser vibrometer type tests are often conducted on the body in white structures enabling the fast acquisition of a large number of measurement points with a good spatial resolution. However, testing a complete vehicle is mostly unfeasible, requiring to evaluate every subsystem individually, hence limiting the usability of this technology in a fast and efficient way. Alternatively, structural vibrations can also be acoustically measured using particle velocity sensors located near a vibrating structure. Several studies have revealed the potential of particle velocity sensors for characterizing structural vibrations, which remarkably accelerates the entire testing process when combined with scanning techniques. Noise barriers as exterior soundproofing Since the early 1970s, it has become common practice in the United States and other industrialized countries to engineer noise barriers along major highways to protect adjacent residents from intruding roadway noise. The Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) in conjunction with State Highway Administration (SHA) adopted Federal Regulation (23 CFR 772) requiring each state to adopt their own policy in regards to abatement of highway traffic noise. Engineering techniques have been developed to predict an effective geometry for the noise barrier design in a particular real-world situation. Noise barriers may be constructed of wood, masonry, earth or a combination thereof. One of the earliest noise barrier designs was in Arlington, Virginia adjacent to Interstate 66, stemming from interests expressed by the Arlington Coalition on Transportation. Possibly the earliest scientifically designed and published noise barrier construction was in Los Altos, California in 1970.

United States Law Review, Volume 17 Little, Brown, 1883 pg 543 Early history The first documented petitions were made by slaves building pyramids in Ancient Egypt who petitioned for better working conditions. In pre-modern Imperial China petitions were always sent to an Office of Transmission (Tongzheng si or ÈÄöÊîøÂè∏) where court secretaries read petitions aloud to the emperor.Brook, Timothy (1999). The Confusions of Pleasure: Commerce and Culture in Ming China, p. 33. University of California Press. . Petitions could be sent by anybody, from a scholar-official to a common farmer, although the petitions were more likely read to the emperor if they were persuasive enough to impeach questionable and corrupt local officials from office. When petitions arrived to the throne, multiple copies were made of the original and stored with the Office of Supervising Secretaries before the original written petition was sent to the emperor. The emergence of petitioning during the reign of Edward I of England (1272-1307) contributed to beginnings of legislative power for the Parliament of England. Petitions became a common form of protest and request to the British House of Commons in the 18th and 19th centuries; one million petitions were submitted to the UK's parliament between 1780 and 1918. The largest was the Great/People's Charter, or petition of the Chartists. The Petition Clause of the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution guarantees the right of the people \\"to petition the Government for a redress of grievances.\\" The right to petition has been held to include the right to file lawsuits against the government. Modern use Petition ‚Äì Budapest, 2015.11.26 Petitions are commonly used in the U.S. to qualify candidates for public office to appear on a ballot; while anyone can be a write-in candidate, a candidate desiring that his or her name appear on printed ballots and other official election materials must gather a certain number of valid signatures from registered voters. In jurisdictions whose laws allow for ballot initiatives, the gathering of a sufficient number of voter signatures qualifies a proposed initiative to be placed on the ballot. The 2003 California recall election, which culminated in the recall of Governor Gray Davis and the election of Arnold Schwarzenegger, began when U.S. Representative Darrell Issa employed paid signature gatherers who obtained millions of signatures at a cost to Issa of millions of dollars. Once the requisite number of signatures was obtained on the recall petition, other petitions were circulated by would-be candidates who wanted to appear on the ballot as possible replacements for Davis. After that step, a vote on the recall was scheduled. Other types of petitions include those that sought to free Nelson Mandela during his imprisonment by the former apartheid government of South Africa. The petitions had no legal effect, but the signatures of millions of people on the petitions represented a moral force that may have helped free Mandela and end apartheid. Non- governmental organizations such as Amnesty International often use petitions in an attempt to exert moral authority in support of various causes. Other nongovernmental subjects of petition drives include corporate personnel decisions.Flight attendant launches petition drive to replace American Airlines executives By Terry Maxon, Fri., Feb. 17, 2012 Dallas Morning News In the United Kingdom, a petition to the parliament in 1990 against ambulance service cuts attracted 4.5 million signatures.

History The Free Will Baptist Church in America grew up on two separate fronts: North and South. In the South the denomination began in 1727 when Paul Palmer started a church in Chowan, North Carolina. The work in the north began with a congregation organized by Benjamin Randall in 1780 at New Durham, New Hampshire. Though they arose independently and there was no organizational connection between them, both taught the doctrines of free grace, free salvation and free will. Free blacks and black slaves were members of predominantly white Free Will Baptist congregations of the South. African- Americans organized their first separate congregation, Shady Grove Free Will Baptist Church, at Snow Hill, Greene County, North Carolina, in 1867. The first annual conference was organized in 1870, and the first association in 1887. The first General Conference for United Free Will Baptists convened at St. John's church in Kinston, North Carolina, on May 8, 1901. The greatest strength of this body is in North Carolina, where it maintains headquarters and a tabernacle and operates Kinston Collegein North Carolina. There are about 50,000 members in 250 churches. The General Conference has published a book of discipline since 1903 and publishes a periodical called The Free Will Baptist Advocate.

The Polish political scene was democratic but chaotic until J√≥zef Pi≈Çsudski (1867‚Äì1935) seized power in May 1926 and democracy ended. The policy of agrarianism led to the redistribution of lands to peasants and the country achieved significant economic growth between 1921 and 1939. A third of the population consisted of minorities‚ÄîUkrainians, Jews, Belarusians, Lithuanians and Germans.Aviel Roshwald, Ethnic Nationalism and the Fall of Empires: Central Europe, the Middle East and Russia, 1914-23 (2000), p. 164. Formative years (1918-1921) The independence of Poland had been successfully promoted to the Allies in Paris by Roman Dmowski and Ignacy Paderewski. U.S. President Woodrow Wilson made the independence of Poland a war goal in his Fourteen Points, and this goal was endorsed by the Allies in spring 1918. As part of the Armistice terms imposed on Germany, all German forces had to stand down in Poland and other occupied areas. So as the war ended, the Germans sent Pi≈Çsudski, then under arrest, back to Warsaw. On November 11, 1918, he took control of the puppet government the Germans had set up. Ignacy Daszy≈Ñski headed a short-lived Polish government in Lublin from November 6 but Pi≈Çsudski had overwhelming prestige at this point. Daszy≈Ñski and the other Polish leaders acknowledged him as head of the army and in effect head of what became the Republic of Poland. Germany, now defeated, followed the terms of the Armistice and withdrew its forces. Jƒôdrzej Moraczewski became the first prime minister (in November 1918) and Dmowski headed the largest party.A Concise History of Poland, by Jerzy Lukowski and Hubert Zawadzki, p. 217-222. From its inception, the Republic fought a series of wars to secure its boundaries. The nation was rural and poor; the richest areas were in the former German areas in the west. Industrialization came very slowly, and was promoted in the mid-1930s with the development of the Central Industrial District. =Boundaries= Most Polish leaders of that period wanted to create a larger Polish state; one optimal plan, dating back to the Paris Peace Conference, included the incorporation of East Prussia and the German city of K√∂nigsberg being placed in a customs union with Poland. At the same time, the exact boundaries of the former Polish‚ÄìLithuanian Commonwealth were not desired, though mentioned as an opening gambit by Roman Dmowski. Much of this land had been controlled by the Russian Empire since the Partitions of Poland and its inhabitants were struggling to create their own states (such as Ukraine, Belarus, and the Baltics: Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia). The Polish leadership did not aim to restore the nation to its 17th-century boundaries.Sandra Halperin, In the Mirror of the Third World: Capitalist Development in Modern Europe, (1996) pp. 40, 41. Opinions varied among Polish politicians as to how much of the territory a new, Polish-led state should contain and what form it should take. J√≥zef Pi≈Çsudski advocated a democratic, Polish-led federation of independent states ‚Äî while Roman Dmowski leader of the Endecja movement represented by the National Democratic Party, set his mind on a more compact Poland composed of ethnic Polish or 'polonizable' territories.Piotr S.

Feldman and Elisabeth Glaser, Cambridge, U.K.; New York: Cambridge University Press, 1998, pp. 313-336. Brest-Litovsk and Versailles and before the Peace of Riga To the southwest, Poland and Czechoslovakia contested boundary disputes (see: Zaolzie). More ominously, an embittered Germany begrudged any territorial loss to its new eastern neighbor. The December 27, 1918 Great Poland Uprising liberated Greater Poland. The 1919 Treaty of Versailles settled the German-Polish borders in the Baltic region. The port city of Danzig (), with a majority German population and Polish minority was declared a free city independent of Germany, and became a bone of contention for decades. Allied arbitration divided the ethnically mixed and highly coveted industrial and mining district of Upper Silesia between Germany and Poland, with Poland receiving the smaller in size, but a more industrialized eastern section in 1922, after series of three Silesian Uprisings. =War with Soviet Russia= The military conflict with the Soviets proved the determinant of Poland's frontiers in the east, a theater rendered chaotic by the repercussions of the Russian revolutions and civil war. Pi≈Çsudski envisioned creating a federation with the rest of Ukraine (led by the Polish-friendly government in Kiev he was to help to install) and Lithuania, thus forming a Central and East European federation called \\"Intermarium\\" (Polish: \\"Miƒôdzymorze\\", literally \\"area between seas\\"). Lenin, leader of the new communist government of Russia, saw Poland as the bridge over which communism would pass into the labor class of a disorganized postwar Germany. And the issue was further complicated as some of the disputed regions had assumed various economic and political identities since the partition in the late 18th century while some did not have an ethnically Polish majority in the first place they were still viewed by Poles as their historic regions since they envisioned Poland as a multiethnic state. In the end, the negotiations broke down, sinking Pi≈Çsudski's idea of Miƒôdzymorze federation; instead, wars like the Polish-Lithuanian War or the Polish-Ukrainian War decided the borders of the region for the next two decades. The Polish-Soviet war, began in 1919, was the most important of the regional wars. Pi≈Çsudski first carried out a major military thrust into Ukraine in 1920 and in May Polish-Ukrainian forces reached Kiev. Just a few weeks later, however, the Polish offensive was met with a Soviet counter-offensive, and Polish forces were forced into a retreat by the Red Army. Poland was driven out of Ukraine and back into the Polish heartland. Most observers at the time marked Poland for extinction and Bolshevization,Margaret MacMillan, Paris: 1919 (2001) p. 227. However at the Battle of Warsaw Pi≈Çsudski organized a stunning counterattack that won a famous victory.Norman Davies, White Eagle, Red Star: The Polish-Soviet War 1919-1920 and The Miracle on the Vistula (2003) pp. 188-225. This \\"Miracle on the Vistula\\" became an iconic victory in Polish memory. Pi≈Çsudski resumed the offensive, pushing the Red forces east. Eventually, both sides, exhausted, signed a compromise peace treaty at Riga in early 1921 that divided the disputed territories of Belarus and Ukraine between the two combatants. These acquisitions were recognized by the international agreement with the Entente. The treaty gave Poland an eastern border well beyond what the peacemakers in Paris had envisioned and added 4,000,000 Ukrainians, 2,000,000 Jews, and 1,000,000 Belarusians to Poland's minority population.Margaret MacMillan, ‚Äò‚ÄôParis: 1919‚Äô‚Äô (2001) p. 228. In Soviet historiography, the Polish-Soviet War was also referred to as \\"the war against White Poles\\", with epithet \\"White Poles\\" (belopoliaki) alleging the \\"counter-revolutionary\\" character of Poland at the time, in an analogy with Russian White Movement. In 1922, in the aftermath of the Polish-Soviet War and Polish-Lithuanian War, Poland also officially annexed Central Lithuania following a plebiscite, which was never recognized by Lithuania. The Riga arrangement influenced the fate of the entire region for the years to come. Ukrainians and Belarusians found themselves without a country or province of their own, and some Polish speakers also found themselves within the borders of the Soviet Union. The latter experienced forced collectivistion, state terror, suppression of religion, purges, labor camps and famine. The newly formed Second Polish Republic, one-third of whose citizens were non-ethnic Poles, engaged in promoting Polish identity, culture and language at the expense of the country's ethnic minorities who felt alienated by the process. From democracy to authoritarian government Poland during the interwar years. Reborn Poland faced a host of daunting challenges: extensive war damage, a ravaged economy, a population one-third composed of wary national minorities, an economy largely under the control of German industrial interests, and a need to reintegrate the three zones that had been forcibly kept apart during the era of partition. Poland's formal political life began in 1921 with the adoption of a constitution that designed Poland as a republic modeled after the French Third Republic, vesting most authority in the legislature, the Sejm. This was mainly to prevent Pi≈Çsudski from establishing himself as a dictator. A multitude of political parties emerged, of which there were four major and dozens of minor ones. All had very different ideologies and voter bases, and could scarcely agree on any major issue. There had been no serious consideration of re-establishing a monarchy, and although the great Polish noble families continued to have their names mentioned in newspapers, it was mostly in the society pages. The chief parties were the left-wing Polish Peasant Party (PSL) and on the right National Democracy party (ND) led by Dmowski. Poland, ethnic minorities (by language) 1937 The new, inexperienced government faced serious problems; already there was rampant corruption among government officials; a dizzying turnover of cabinets caused confusion and distrust.Watt, pp. 183-5. At a deeper level there was profound disagreement about inclusiveness in the new state. Roman Dmowski envisioned an ethnically- homogeneous Polish nation, and a pro-Western, anti-German path to modernization; he also espoused strong anti-Semitic attitudes, and emphasized that Poland should be a Catholic and hierarchical state.Piotr S. Wandycz, \\"Poland's Place in Europe in the Concepts of Pi≈Çsudski and Dmowski,\\" East European Politics & Societies (1990) 4#3 pp. 451-468.Andreas Kossert, \\"Founding Father of Modern Poland and Nationalistic Antisemite: Roman Dmowski,\\" in In the Shadow of Hitler: Personalities of the Right in Central and Eastern Europe edited by Rebecca Haynes and Martyn Rady, (2011) pp. 89-105. Pi≈Çsudski, however, rooted his ideal in notions about the multi-ethnic Polish‚ÄìLithuanian Commonwealth. In practice that meant ignoring the minority vote at home and seeking agreements with nearby countries. Universal suffrage gave the minorities a voice, especially when they formed a coalition, the Bloc of National Minorities (BMN) led by the Jews and including the others who together comprised a third of the population and 20% of the vote. However, the districts were gerrymandered to minimize minority representation. The BMN helped elect Gabriel Narutowicz as president on the PSL ticket in 1922, but he came under nasty attacks from the right and was assassinated after five days in office. The BMN coalition declined in significance and shut down in 1930 as the different groups cut their own deals with the government on isolated issues.Davies, God's Playground 2:426. =Coup of 1926= After the constitution was adopted, Pi≈Çsudski resigned from office, unhappy with the limited role of the executive branch. But he continued to keep a close eye on political developments. The ineffectiveness of the Sejm led some of his inner circle to suggest that he launch a military coup and regain power; he said no. By 1926 he was persuaded and launched the coup of May 1926, which succeeded with little violence. For the next decade, Pi≈Çsudski dominated Polish affairs as strongman of a generally popular centrist regime, although he never held a formal title except for minister of defense. He retained the 1921 constitution, and the noisy, ineffective Sejm continued to operate, but it nearly always gave him what he wanted. Critics of the regime were occasionally arrested, but most were sued for libel. The marshal portrayed himself as a national saviour who was above partisan politics and gained more popular support by distancing himself from the Polish Socialist Party. In 1935 a new Polish Constitution was adopted, but Pi≈Çsudski soon died and his prot√©g√© successors drifted toward open authoritarianism. Opposition voices were increasingly harassed or jailed, a situation that was not surprising in view of the regime's growing fears over national security. In many respects, the Second Republic fell short of the high expectations of 1918. As happened elsewhere in Central Europe, with the exception of Czechoslovakia, the attempt to implant democracy did not succeed. Governments polarized between right- and left-wing factions, neither of which was prepared to honor the actions taken by the other.Polonsky, Antony. (1972). Politics in Independent Poland, 1921-1939. The Crisis of Constitutional Government. Oxford.Biskupski, Mieczyslaw B. (2000) The History of Poland. Greenwood. =Economic and social problems= Serious difficulties arose in dealing with foreign assets and internal minorities. The government nationalized foreign-owned assets and operated them because there was insufficient domestic capital to buy them and because it was easier than determining who should get what. Overall, Poland had a higher degree of state involvement in the economy and less foreign investment than any other nation in eastern Europe. This emphasis on economic centralization hampered Poland's development. The economy was largely rural, and the worldwide Great Depression that began in 1929 saw hardship in every sector. Worst hit were the peasants whose incomes plunged 50% or more. The government had few solutions except to reduce its own spending as tax revenues fell.Watt, Bitter Glory, pp. 293-96.M. C. Kaser and E. A. Radice, eds., The Economic History of Eastern Europe 1919-1975: Volume II: Interwar Policy, The War, and Reconstruction (1987) ch. 8. Minorities About a third of the total population were members of minorities, including five or six million Ukrainians, over three million Jews, one and a half million Belarusians, and some 800,000 Germans.Peter D. Stachura, Poland, 1918-1945: An Interpretive and Documentary History of the Second Republic (Routledge 2004), p. 79. These minorities were increasingly alienated, complaining that they were marginalized in politics and denied rights Poland had agreed to in treaties. Historian Peter D. Stachura has examined the ethnic issue in interwar Poland and summarizes the consensus of historians, he writes: :\\"It is undeniable that the Second Republic did not face any greater challenge than that of devising a policy towards the minorities that would bring harmony and peaceful coexistence rather than bitterness, confrontation and strife. The historiographical verdict is that Poland signally failed to address this question in a satisfactory manner. Indeed, the vast majority of historians have adopted a highly censorious attitude towards the multitude of policies and attitudes which were pursued towards the minorities by the state. Often influenced by Communist, Marxist, Soviet or liberal political and ideological perspectives, they refer unequivocally to 'oppression', 'persecution', 'terror', 'discrimination', even 'murder', as the salient characteristics of an intrinsically chauvinistic Polish approach that was designed to relegate the minorities to the status of second-class citizens. Such a situation, it is argued, meant that Poland failed repeatedly to respect the formal statutory guarantees which were introduced after 1918, notably through the Minorities' Treaty of 1919, the Treaty of Riga (Article VII) in 1921, and the Polish constitutions of 1921 and 1935.\\"Stachura, Poland, 1918-1945 (2004) p. 80. Stachura himself thinks that historians have been too harsh in their negative judgment. He notes that Poland had to contend with \\"an obstreperous and fundamentally disloyal German minority\\" that was incited by \\"fanatical\\" German nationalists next door. Poles talked of forced assimilation and seizure of industrial assets, but the governments before 1926 were too weak to carry them out. After 1926 Pi≈Çsudski had no interest in so doing. The Germans in Poland had above-average incomes, had a full panoply of civic organizations and German-language schools, and were represented in the Sejm. A stalemate resulted. Their status became a major threat after Hitler came to power in Germany in 1933, because \\"the overwhelming majority of these Germans became ardent Nazis in the 1930s and a 'fifth column' when Poland was attacked in September 1939.\\"Stachura, Poland, 1918-1945 (2004), p. 82. Relations with the much larger Ukrainian minority, who formed 15% or so of the national population and were in the majority in several eastern provinces, were even more strained. The Ukrainians were poor peasants who resented their Polish landlords and the government's policy of polonizing them. The schools after 1924 were bilingual (students had to learn Polish), and government offices were not allowed to use Ukrainian. Some Ukrainians tried to sabotage, and the government cracked down with mass arrests; it tolerated the Polish arson of Ukrainian community centers. Orthodox churches were closed, especially in Volhynia province. Some men went underground and tried to assassinate Ukrainians who collaborated with the government, as well as top Polish officials. A compromise was reached in 1935 that somewhat quieted the situation, but the Polish Army saw a war with the USSR looming and refused to support the policy.Stachura, Poland, 1918-1945 (2004), pp. 82-83.Davies, God's Playground, pp. 405-7. As the Great Depression worsened in the 1930s, antisemitism began to rise even though Poland was home to over three million Jews (10 percent of Poland's population), the largest Jewish population in Europe at the time. The impoverished Jewish families relied on their own local charities, which by 1929 had reached unprecedented proportions, providing services such as religion, education, health and other services to the value of 200 million z≈Çoty a year,Joseph Marcus, Social and political history of the Jews in Poland, 1919-1939, p. 47. thanks in part to Jewish per capita income among the working Jews more than 40% higher than that of Polish non- Jews.Yehuda Bauer: A History of the American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee 1929-1939 (1983) Chapter 1. A Time of Crisis: 1929-1932. From the 1920s the Polish government excluded Jews from receiving government bank credits, public sector employment, and obtaining business licenses. From the 1930s limits were placed on Jewish enrollment in university education, Jewish shops, Jewish export firms, Shechita, Jewish admission to the medical and legal professions, Jews in business associations, etc. While in 1921-22 25% of students were Jews, by 1938-9 the proportion went down to 8%. The far-right National Democracy (Endeks) organized anti-Jewish boycotts. Following the death of Poland's ruler J√≥zef Pi≈Çsudski in 1935, the Endeks intensified their efforts. In 1937 the Endeks passed resolutions that \\"its main aim and duty must be to remove the Jews from all spheres of social, economic, and cultural life in Poland\\". The government in response organized the Camp of National Unity (OZON); OZON advocated mass emigration of Jews from Poland, boycott of Jews, numerus clausus (see also Ghetto benches), and other limitation on Jewish rights. At the same time the Polish government supported the Zionist Irgun, training its members in Tatra Mountains and in 1937 the Polish authorities began to deliver large amounts of weapons to the Jewish underground in Palestine, capable of arming up to 10,000 men. On international arena Poland supported the creation of Jewish state in Palestine hoping gradual emigration over next 30 years will lower Jewish population in Poland to 500,0000The Holocaust: Europe, the World, and the Jews, 1918 - 1945 By Norman Goda In January 1937, Foreign Minister J√≥zef Beck announced to the Sejm that Poland had room for 500,000 Jews.

He later spoke of 80,000 to 100,000 leaving per year for the next thirty years. and cooperated with the leader of Revisionist Zionism, Ze'ev Jabotinsky who hoped Poland would inherit mandate of Palestine from Great Britain; his \\"Evacuation Plan\\" called for the settlement of 1.5 million Jews within 10 years in Palestine, including 750,000 Polish JewsIn the Shadow of Zion Promised Lands Before Israel by Adam L. Rovner NYU Press 2014 page 133 This idea was warmly received by Polish government which pursued a policy of mass emigration towards its Jewish population and was looking for locations for them to resettle; Jabotinsky on his part viewed antisemitism in Poland as a result of the shortage of jobs and economic situation, rather than rabid racism as was in Nazi GermanyJabotinsky's Children: Polish Jews and the Rise of Right-Wing Zionism By Daniel Kupfert Heller page 227Black Earth: The Holocaust as History and Warning Timothy Snyder, In June 1936 Jabotinsky, the leader of Revisionist Zionists who split out from main General Zionist movement, presented an \\"evacuation plan\\" to Polish foreign ministry, claiming that Palestine could absorb up to eight million Jews. His imitative was announced in Polish press as settlement of 1.5 million Jews from on both sides of the River Jordan over next 10 years. Jabotinsky hoped Poland would inherit the mandate of Palestine from Great Britain.Szymon Rudnicki, Marek Karliner & Laurence Weinbaum (2014) Linking the Vistula and the Jordan: The Genesis of Relations between Poland and the State of Israel, Israel Journal of Foreign Affairs, 8:1, 103-114 \\"In 1937, the Polish Ministry of Foreign Affairs viewed the League of Nations as the right place for manifesting its support for the cause of developing a Jewish state in Palestine. This had been declared at the League by Foreign Minister J√≥zef Beck.11 He also supported the idea of an international conference and campaign for organising and facilitating Jewish emigration.12 Talks were held with British Foreign Secretary Anthony Eden, and in the US, with President Franklin D.

Polish agriculture suffered from the usual handicaps of Eastern European nations: technological backwardness, low productivity, and lack of capital and access to markets. The former German areas in the west had better rainfall and soil quality and were the most productive, while the former Russian and Austrian areas were below-average. The Polish peasantry believed that it would be so much better if they owned their land and did not pay rents to a landowner. They endorsed agrarianism and called for land redistribution away from large estates to peasants. This was done and also many very small farms were consolidated into viable units. Land reforms were undertaken along ethnic lines. In the west, Germans who had been made foreigners in 1919 quickly lost their land. In the east, by contrast, Ukrainian and Belarusian peasants tilled for Polish landowners and no serious moves toward land redistribution were taken. No alternative industrial jobs were developed and underemployment was high in rural areas.Richard Watt, Bitter Glory pp. 196-209.Witold Staniewicz, \\"The Agrarian Problem in Poland between the Two World Wars,\\" Slavonic & East European Review (1999) 43#100 pp. 23-33. in JSTOR The socialist politician Boles≈Çaw Limanowski thought deeply about Agrarianism and worked out an eclectic program that fit Polish conditions. His practical experience as a farm manager combined with socialist, \\"single-tax,\\" and Slavic communal ideas shaped his worldview. He proposed a form of agrarian socialism with large state farms to counteract the inefficiency of very smallholdings. In independent Poland, he advocated expropriation of gentry estates. His observation of peasant individualism convinced him that Poland should combine voluntary collectivism and individual possession of the leased land. His pragmatism left the room even for private peasant ownership, despite his Marxism.K.J. Cottam, \\"Boleslaw Limanowski, A Polish Theoretician of Agrarian Socialism,\\" Slavonic and East European Review (1973) 51#122 pp. 58-74. in JSTOR  International relations  Foreign minister J√≥zef Beck was in full charge of foreign policy by 1935 but he had a weak hand. Poland with 35 million people had a large population but a thin industrial base; its war plans focused on the Soviet Union instead of Germany. Poland had long borders with two more powerful dictatorships, Hitler's Germany and Stalin's USSR. Poland was increasingly isolated. Overy says that of all the new states in Europe: :\\"Poland was almost certainly the most disliked and her Foreign Minister the most distrusted. Poland's pursuit of an independent line left her bereft of any close friends by the end of 1938‚Ä¶. The Western powers saw Poland as a greedy revisionist power, illiberal, anti-Semitic, pro- German; Beck was a 'menace,' 'arrogant and treacherous.'\\" In February 1921, Poland signed a secret military agreement with France, which obliged each party to mutual aid in the event of German aggression. In March 1921, the Poles signed a treaty of mutual assistance with Romania, directed against the threat from the Soviet Union. Poland sought to be the leader of an independent bloc of nations between the Soviet Union and Germany that would unite to fend off those powers. However, Poland ran into so many disputes with its smaller neighbors that it was never able to build a bloc. At first, France favored Poland, because France wanted an ally against Germany; if Germany faced a two- front war, it would be less likely to attack France. France was especially helpful at the 1919 Paris conference and in the 1920s when it resisted British efforts to weaken Poland. After 1935, however, France distrusted Beck and lost interest in Eastern Europe and Poland stood increasingly alone. In 1925, Berlin formally recognized its post-1918 boundaries in the west with France, but not in the east with Poland.Kochanski (2012), The Eagle Unbowed, p. 36 The same year, Germany slashed coal imports from Poland by half, which triggered the German‚ÄìPolish trade war. Relations with the Soviet Union remained hostile, but Pi≈Çsudski was willing to negotiate, and in 1932 the two countries signed a non-aggression pact.Steiner (2005), p. 526 Shortly afterward, Hitler came to power. Rumors circulated to the effect that Pi≈Çsudski proposed to France that Poland and France launch a preemptive military strike to overthrow Hitler in 1933. Most historians do not believe this happened, pointing out that Pi≈Çsudski's war plans were focused on Russia and he made no preparations for any sort of war with Germany. Furthermore, no one in France reported any such inquiry from Poland. Pi≈Çsudski made demands regarding Danzig that Hitler immediately approved; relations between Poland and Nazi Germany became friendly and they signed the German‚ÄìPolish Non-Aggression Pact in January 1934. At the same time, Czechoslovakia, Romania, and Yugoslavia were allied in the Little Entente with French support. Polish membership there could have provided additional security; however, relations with Prague were unfriendly due to border disputes, so they never reached an agreement.Piotr Wandycz, \\"The Little Entente: Sixty Years Later,\\" Slavonic & East European Review (1981) 59#4 pp. 548-564. in JSTOR Poland 1939, physical Panorama of spa town Wis≈Ça, 1939 Szczawnica in Pieniny, 1939 France was an ally of both Poland and Czechoslovakia and tried repeatedly to get them to resolve their border disputes and become allies, and also collaborate with the Soviet Union. There was no success, not just because of the border issues but also because Prague's willingness to work with Moscow clashed with the firm resolve of Warsaw to keep its distance from Moscow.

I. B. Tauris (1991) p. 151. and rejected Beck's proposal to establish anti-German cooperation. The failure to establish any alliances in Eastern Europe meant the only ally was France; Pi≈Çsudski increasingly doubted the value of that alliance. The Locarno Pact, signed in 1925 by the major West European powers with the aim of guaranteeing peace in the region, contained no guarantee of Poland's western border.Wandycz, Piotr S. (1962). France and her Eastern Allies, 1919-1925: French-Czechoslovak-Polish Relations from the Paris Peace Conference in Locarno.Minneapolis. In May 1934, the Polish-Soviet non- aggression pact was extended until 31 December 1945. During the period 1934‚Äì1939, Polish-Soviet relations were correct but cool, while Polish-German relations were normal and occasionally friendly. =Military capabilities= The budget for the year 1934-35 allocated 762 million zlotych for the army, about 32% of the total. It provided for an effective strength of 7,905 officers, 37,000 professional soldiers, and 211,110 militia soldiers. Apart from the army, the budget provided 105 million zlotych for police troops consisting of 774 officers and 28,592 men.\\"Poland.\\" Keesing's Contemporary Archives, Volume I, (November 1933) p. 1017. By 1939 Poland had a large army, with 283,000 on active duty, in 37 infantry divisions, 11 cavalry brigades, and two armored brigades, plus artillery units. Another 700,000 men served in the reserves. A major problem was lack of funds. The limited defense budget allowed minimal mechanization; most weapons were produced in Poland, but the production rate was low (7TP tank is a prime example), and foreign exchange was scarce. The fact that Poland was halfway through the rearming process that was to end in 1942 did not help. Ten divisions were never mobilized. The cancellation of the mobilization, under the pressure from France and Great Britain, and restarting the mobilization less than a week later created confusion. Moreover, not only did the German military and civilian volunteers commit war crimes against the ethnic Poles and Polish Jews, they spread rumors of massive ethnic cleansing which lead thousands of people to flee the German advance and made military maneuver difficult.Walter M. Drzewiecki,\\"The Polish Army on the Eve of World War II,\\" Polish Review (1981) 26#3 pp 54-64 in JSTORHalik Kochanski, The Eagle Unbowed: Poland and the Poles in the Second World War (2012) pp. 51-54. Gdynia, modern Polish seaport, est.1926 Polish pavilion in New York City, 1939 Damaged Warsaw PZL aircraft plant following the German invasion of Poland, December 1939 Poland did have PZL, the state aviation company that made good planes. In 1931 it developed the PZL P.11, the most advanced fighter in the world of the early 1930s. In the mid-1930s its successor the P-24 was even better armed and faster, but Poland exported it to earn currency, forcing the use of semi-obsolete PZL P.11 and a couple of dozen old PZL P.7 fighters. They were no match against the German Messerschmitt 109 which could fly higher, was better armed, and flew 100 km/h faster. In spite of the shortcomings, at least 110 victories were credited to the P.11 for the loss of about 30 of their own. The PZL.37 ≈Åo≈õ was an excellent twin-engine medium bomber; Poland had 36 ready-to-fight when the war started. In 1939 Poland had 390 combat planes that were mostly obsolescent. Germany had 2800 new fighter planes plus bombers and transports.Halik Kochanski, The Eagle Unbowed p. 54.Adam Zamoyski, The Forgotten Few: The Polish Air Force in the Second World War (2000) ch 1-3 excerpt and text search The Poles, in spite of their desperate situation, managed to win two battles against the invading Soviets, including one where the Soviet infantry was charging the Polish positions marching shoulder to shoulder, making them into an extremely easy target to the machine guns, and some of the Soviet POW's switched sides to the Polish. Poles broke the early diplomatic version of Enigma cipher and transferred the results to France and the United Kingdom. In spite of its shortcomings, the Polish military can easily be ranked in the top 10 strongest national militaries as of 1939; not because the Polish military was so great, but because other national military forces were so weak and backward. Zaloga and Madej point out, in \\"The Polish Campaign 1939\\" that Poland had one of the largest tank forces on Earth, as of 1939 bigger than the task force of the USA.Steven Zaloga and Victor Madej, The Polish Campaign 1939 Hardcover ‚Äì March 1985. The relative strength of the Polish armed forces and the fear of the Polish military might be shown by Lithuania (1938 Polish ultimatum to Lithuania) made the Polish government's propaganda believable to the public. The Polish government had no choice, but to claim that an attack either by the Germans or by the Soviets would have been successfully repelled. The Polish government could not afford a capitulation of the Polish public because of the industrialization projects such as Central Industrial Region (Poland), nearly finished by early 1939, and the projects that were to follow it. =Foreign policy 1935‚Äì39= After the death of Pi≈Çsudski in May 1935, policies in Poland were set by five senior officials, including President Ignacy Mo≈õcicki; Vice- President Eugeniusz Kwiatkowski; the Premier, Felicjan S≈Çawoj Sk≈Çadkowski; and Marshal Edward Smigly-Rydz, the Commander-in-Chief of the army. Foreign policy was the exclusive domain of the Foreign Minister, Colonel J√≥zef Beck. Elections were held but there was no democracy and the Sejm was merely a rubber stamp. Watt notes that these men had emerged victorious from their struggles for independence and had never known conquest. \\"Courage, flair, heroism, devouring ambition, all these they had in abundance; realism and worst-case analysis, let alone defeatism or appeasement, were alien to them entirely.\\"Donald Cameron Watt, How War Came: The Immediate Origins of the Second World War 1938-1939 (1989) p. 58. Poland's dream of leading a bloc of neutral nations in Eastern Europe collapsed after 1933 with the advent of Hitler's openly expansionist Nazi regime in Germany and the obvious warning of France's desire to resist Germany's expansion. Pi≈Çsudski retained the French connection but had progressively less faith in its usefulness. Hitler's long- term goals included annexing Polish territories and subordinating the remaining parts of Poland, an idea that he revealed to his closest circle already in 1933Diemut Majer, Non-Germans Under the Third Reich: The Nazi Judicial and Administrative System in Germany and Occupied Eastern Europe with Special Regard to Occupied Poland, 1939-1945 says \\"As early as the fall of 1933 Hitler had laid out before his most intimate circle his concept of a future Europe from the Atlantic to the Caucasus. Around Greater Germany (including Austria, Bohemia, Moravia, and western Poland), he envisioned not a federation of equal partners but a Bund of \\"auxiliary nations\\" without economies and polities of their own.\\" Poland's solution was a policy of normal relations with both Germany and the Soviet Union but alliance with neither (also described as 'the policy of equal distance' or 'equilibrium'). Accordingly, the Polish leadership rejected German proposals of cooperation against Russia. At the same time, Beck's goal was 'to avoid isolated confrontation with Germany as long as this was possible'. The policy rested on two pillars: the non-aggression pacts signed by Poland with Germany and the USSR. Following a border incident in March 1938, Poland presented an ultimatum to Lithuania, demanding the re-establishment of diplomatic relations between Poland and Lithuania and the previously closed border with Poland to be reopened. Faced with the threat of war, the Lithuanian government accepted the Polish demands. In October 1938, the Munich Agreement, with British and French approval, allowed Germany to take over areas of Czechoslovakia with a significant German minority, the so-called Sudetenland. Poland had long been hostile to Czechoslovakia and now sided with Germany. Poland demanded that Czechoslovakia give up the Teschen, where Poles made about 70% of inhabitants, or otherwise Poland threatened to take it by force. Faced with an ultimatum from both Poland and Germany, Czechoslovakia gave up the area, which was annexed by Poland on October 2, 1938.Richard A. Woytak, \\"Polish Military Intervention into Czechoslovakian Teschen and Western Slovakia in September‚ÄìNovember 1938,\\" East European Quarterly (1972) 6#3 pp. 376-387. In early 1939, Germany invaded the rest of Czechoslovakia, which, in March 1939, then ceased to exist. Germany had demanded that Poland join the Anti-Comintern Pact as a satellite state of Germany.John Lukacs, The Last European War: September 1939 - December 1941 p. 31. Germany demanded an extraterritorial highway connecting Germany proper with Danzig and then East Prussia, which would cut off Poland from the sea and its main trade route to which Poland refused. Germany also pressed for the incorporation of Danzig, a Nazi ruled city-state with a 90% German population that had been separated from Germany in 1920 and functioning as a Free City in a customs union with Poland ever since.For early German propaganda calling for the return of the corridor and Danzig to Germany, see Anna M. Cienciala, \\"German Propaganda for the Revision of the Polish-German Frontier in Danzig and the Corridor: Its Effects on British Opinion and the British Foreign Policy-Making Elite in the Years 1919-1933,\\" Amtemurale vol. 20 (1976), pp. 77-129. After it rejected German territorial demands regarding Danzig and Gda≈Ñsk Pomerania, Poland's position was steadily weakening as other nations such as Hungary and Romania gravitated toward Germany's orbit. Poland was at the time allied with Romania and France. Two critical developments caught Poland by surprise. At the end of March 1939, Britain and France announced that if Germany invaded Poland they would declare war. In terms of helping Poland in an actual war, everyone realized they could do very little. The hope was that the threat of a two-front war would deter Germany, especially since it had to worry about the role of the Soviet Union. Hitler thought Britain and France were bluffing, but he handled the Soviet problem in late August, by a stunning agreement with Stalin in what amounted to a friendly alliance, which included secret provisions to partition Poland‚Äîand indeed divide up much of eastern EuropeRichard Overy, The Road to War: the Origins of World War II (1989) pp. 1-20. The British and French offer was not a bluff‚Äîthey declared war on Germany when it invaded Poland, but neither was in a position to provide serious help. Poland itself had a million-man army (and another million in the reserves) but fell far short in terms of training, airpower, artillery, tanks, machine guns, radios, and trucks. The Polish military budget was about 2% of Germany's; its commanding general Marshal Smigly-Rydz was not well prepared for the challenge.Kochanski, The Eagle Unbowed (2012) p. 52. =Polish Corridor and Danzig= The Germans wanted restoration of the pre-Versailles Treaty borders and so they launched new demands on Poland.Shirer, William L.

They insisted on a plebiscite to determine the ownership of the \\"Polish corridor\\". Only those living in the corridor prior to 1918 would be allowed to vote. The proposal called for a subsequent population exchange that would move all Germans, then in Poland, out of the final region declared to be \\"Poland\\".Krasuski, Jerzy. \\"The Key Points of Polish-German Relations up to 1939,\\" Polish Western Affairs, no. 2.

The same would occur for all Poles living in what was declared, after the vote, to be \\"Germany\\". Danzig was to become part of Germany regardless of the vote, but if Germany lost, it was still guaranteed access to East Prussia through an autobahn system that it would administer, stretching from Germany proper to Danzig to East Prussia.Kimmich, Christoph M. The Free City in German Foreign Policy, 1919-1934 (1968). If Poland lost the vote, the corridor would go to Germany and the seaport of Gdynia would become a Polish exclave with a route connecting Poland with Gdynia. After the British-French guarantee of support for Poland was announced on April 3, negotiations over Danzig ended. Germany invaded Poland on September 1, 1939.Levine, Herbert S.

For us, it is a matter of expanding our living space in the east and making food supplies secure.‚ÄùOvery, The Road to War p. 16. The total destruction of the Polish state, Polish culture, and indeed the Polish population had become Hitler's main objective. He wanted the agricultural land to resettle German farmers.Anita J.

Instead, all events are taken to be caused directly by God. (A related theory, which has been called \\"occasional causation\\", also denies a link of efficient causation between mundane events, but may differ as to the identity of the true cause that replaces them.Steven Nadler, 'The Occasionalism of Louis de la Forge', in Nadler (ed.), Causation in Early Modern Philosophy (University Park, PA: Pennsylvania State University Press, 1993), 57‚Äì73; Nadler, 'Descartes and Occasional Causation', British Journal for the History of Philosophy, 2 (1994) 35‚Äì54.) The theory states that the illusion of efficient causation between mundane events arises out of God's causing of one event after another. However, there is no necessary connection between the two: it is not that the first event causes God to cause the second event: rather, God first causes one and then causes the other.  Islamic theological schools  The doctrine first reached prominence in the Islamic theological schools of Iraq, especially in Basra. The ninth century theologian Abu al-Hasan al-Ash'ari argued that there is no Secondary Causation in the created order. The world is sustained and governed through direct intervention of a divine primary causation. As such the world is in a constant state of recreation by God. The most famous proponent of the Asharite occasionalist doctrine was Abu Hamid Muhammad ibn Muhammad al-Ghazali, an 11th-century theologian based in Baghdad. In The Incoherence of the Philosophers,. Al-Ghazali launched a philosophical critique against Neoplatonic-influenced early Islamic philosophers such as Al- Farabi and Ibn Sina. In response to the philosophers' claim that the created order is governed by secondary efficient causes (God being, as it were, the Primary and Final Cause in an ontological and logical sense), Ghazali argues that what we observe as regularity in nature based presumably upon some natural law is actually a kind of constant and continual regularity. There is no independent necessitation of change and becoming, other than what God has ordained. To posit an independent causality outside of God's knowledge and action is to deprive Him of true agency, and diminish His attribute of power. In his famous example, when fire and cotton are placed in contact, the cotton is burned not because of the heat of the fire, but through God's direct intervention, a claim which he defended using logic. In the 12th century, this theory was defended and further strengthened by the Islamic theologian Fakhr al-Din al-Razi, using his expertise in the natural sciences of astronomy, cosmology and physics. Because God is usually seen as rational, rather than arbitrary, His behaviour in normally causing events in the same sequence (i.e., what appears to us to be efficient causation) can be understood as a natural outworking of that principle of reason, which we then describe as the laws of nature. Properly speaking, however, these are not laws of nature but laws by which God chooses to govern His own behaviour (His autonomy, in the strict sense) ‚Äî in other words, His rational Will. This is not, however, an essential element of an occasionalist account, and occasionalism can include positions where God's behaviour (and thus that of the world) is viewed as ultimately inscrutable, thus maintaining God's essential transcendence. On this understanding, apparent anomalies such as miracles are not really such: they are simply God behaving in a way that appears unusual to us. Given His transcendent freedom, He is not bound even by His own nature. Miracles, as breaks in the rational structure of the universe, can occur, since God's relationship with the world is not mediated by rational principles. In a 1978 article in Studia Islamica, Lenn Goodman asks the question, \\"Did Al-Ghaz√¢l√Æ Deny Causality?\\"Goodman, Lenn Evan. ‚ÄúDid Al-Ghaz√¢l√Æ Deny Causality?‚Äù Studia Islamica, no. 47, 1978, pp. 83‚Äì120. JSTOR, JSTOR, www.jstor.org/stable/1595550. and demonstrates that Ghazali did not deny the existence of observed, \\"worldly\\" causation. According to Goodman's analysis, Ghazali does not claim that there is never any link between observed cause and observed effect: rather, Ghazali argues that there is no necessary link between observed cause and effect.  Dualism  One of the motivations for the theory is the dualist belief that mind and matter are so utterly different in their essences that one cannot affect the other. Thus, a person's mind cannot be the true cause of his hand's moving, nor can a physical wound be the true cause of mental anguish. In other words, the mental cannot cause the physical and vice versa. Also, occasionalists generally hold that the physical cannot cause the physical either, for no necessary connection can be perceived between physical causes and effects. The will of God is taken to be necessary. The doctrine is, however, more usually associated with certain seventeenth century philosophers of the Cartesian school. There are hints of an occasionalist viewpoint here and there in Descartes's own writings, but these can mostly be explained away under alternative interpretations.Daniel Garber, Descartes' Metaphysical Physics (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1992), 299‚Äì305. However, many of his later followers quite explicitly committed themselves to an occasionalist position. In one form or another, the doctrine can be found in the writings of: Johannes Clauberg, Claude Clerselier, Gerauld de Cordemoy, Arnold Geulincx, Louis de La Forge, Fran√ßois Lamy, and (most notably), Nicolas Malebranche.  Hume's arguments, Berkeley and Leibniz  These occasionalists' negative argument, that no necessary connections could be discovered between mundane events, was anticipated by certain arguments of Nicholas of Autrecourt in the fourteenth century, and were later taken up by David Hume in the eighteenth. Hume, however, stopped short when it came to the positive side of the theory, where God was called upon to replace such connections, complaining that \\"We are got into fairy land [...] Our line is too short to fathom such immense abysses.\\"David Hume, An Enquiry concerning Human Understanding, sect. 7, pt. 1. Instead, Hume felt that the only place to find necessary connections was in the subjective associations of ideas within the mind itself. George Berkeley was also inspired by the occasionalists, and he agreed with them that no efficient power could be attributed to bodies. For Berkeley, bodies merely existed as ideas in percipient minds, and all such ideas were, as he put it, \\"visibly inactive\\".George Berkeley, A Treatise concerning the Principles of Human Knowledge, sect. 25. However, Berkeley disagreed with the occasionalists by continuing to endow the created minds themselves with efficient power. Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz agreed with the occasionalists that there could be no efficient causation between distinct created substances, but he did not think it followed that there was no efficient power in the created world at all. On the contrary, every simple substance had the power to produce changes in itself. The illusion of transeunt efficient causation, for Leibniz, arose out of the pre-established harmony between the alterations produced immanently within different substances. Leibniz means, that if God did not exist, \\"there would be nothing real in the possibilities, not only nothing existent, but also nothing possible.\\"  Quantum mechanics  In 1993, Karen Harding's paper \\"Causality Then and Now: Al Ghazali and Quantum Theory\\" described several \\"remarkable\\" similarities between Ghazali's concept of occasionalism and the widely accepted Copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics. She stated: \\"In both cases, and contrary to common sense, objects are viewed as having no inherent properties and no independent existence. In order for an object to exist, it must be brought into being either by God (al Ghazili) or by an observer (the Copenhagen Interpretation).\\" She also stated:. Continuing philosopher Graham Harman's work on Occasionalism in the context of Object Oriented Ontology, in 2020 Simon Weir proposed an alternate view of the relationship between Quantum theory and Occasionalism, opposed to the Copenhagen Interpretation, where virtual particles act as one of many kinds of mediating sensual objects.

Janitors' primary responsibility is as a cleaner. Janitors typically earn an average wage of $15 per hour in the United States. That translates to an annual salary of around $35,000 for states that pay Janitors the most amount, such as New York, Massachusetts, and Connecticut. In some cases, they will also carry out maintenance and security duties. A similar position, but usually with more managerial duties and not including cleaning, is occupied by building superintendents in the United States (and occasionally in Canada) and School Site Managers in schools in the United Kingdom. Cleaning is one of the most commonly outsourced services.  Occupational tasks  Although most of the work performed by janitors and building cleaners is indoors, sometimes it can be outdoors. Office buildings are usually cleaned when they are vacant, so most of the office janitorial staff work during the evening. The work can be physically demanding and sometimes dirty and unpleasant. General janitor duties often include the following tasks: * Cleaning and restocking bathrooms ** Sinks ** Toilets ** Urinals ** Floor cleaning, refinishing, and polishing (sweeping, mopping, scrubbing and buffing) ** Clearing garbage bins ** Restocking restroom paper products and other supplies such as feminine products and air fresheners ** Cleaning mirrors * Cleaning floors (mopping, sweeping, polishing) * Carpet cleaning (dry method, extraction, steam and bonnet) * Cleaning carpeting (vacuuming) * Cleaning stainless steel and other special surfaces * Clearing lunch room/kitchen * Cleaning tables in cubicles, meeting rooms, etc... * Emptying trash and recycling bin * Unlocking and locking buildings at the beginning and end of the day * Stripping and waxing floors using Floor buffer * Cleaning air-conditioner vents * Crime scene cleaning (requires being fully certified and pay scale starts from $300.00 to $700.00+ an hour Facts about Crime Scene Cleaners! by Documents & Resources for Small Business Professionals DOCSTOC News Source, Fed 12, 2013) * Litter picking * Spot cleaning (generally spills - coffee for instance) * Sanitization * Room and event setups (college/schools, etc.) * Raising and lowering flags (schools) * Minor maintenance work, such as: changing lightbulbs and filters, replacing ceiling tiles, doing small repairs, performing regular inspection and testing of building equipment, etc. * Outdoor work, such as: cleaning walkways, mowing lawns, tending to landscaping, leaf clean up, snow removal, etc. In some places, a separate crew or company may do outdoor work. * Porterage (internal deliveries; movement of equipment or people in hospitals, colleges, etc.) * Unclogging blocked drains and toilets * Removing vomit, urine, and feces from public areas = Pay scale = In 2010, the median pay of a janitor working in the US was $10.68 per hour. The yearly salary could grow by 11% according to the statistics of 2010. Office cleaning Office cleaning staff perform many of the same duties as janitors. However the tasks are divided among different members. Additional tasks include: * watering plants (pruning as well) * cleaning sinks, refrigerators, microwaves and toasters in office kitchens; clearing recycling and garbage bins * dusting furniture and computer equipment (monitors and desk area, but excluding keyboards) and tables  Outsourcing  Cleaning is one of the most commonly outsourced services. Some of the reasons for this include: * Basic cleaning tasks are standardised, with little variation among different enterprises. * The nature of the job and required standard of performance can be clearly defined and specified in a contract, unlike more technical or professional jobs for which such specification is harder to develop. *Some organizations prefer to outsource work unrelated to their core business in order to save additional salaries and benefits required to manage the work. * Some organizations may feel uncomfortable dealing with labour relations related to low wage employees; by outsourcing, these labor relations issues are transferred to a contractor whose staff are comfortable and experienced in dealing with these issues, and their approach can benefit from economies of scale. * If a janitor is unavailable due to sickness or leave, a contractor which employs many janitors can easily assign a substitute. A small organisation which employs one or a few janitors directly will have much more trouble with this. Demography Between 17% to 23% of the total undocumented immigrant population living in the United States work in the cleaning industry (and growing at a rate of 1/2% to 1/3% percent per year). In addition to this population offering an abundant source of inexpensive labor, janitorial work is mostly undertaken at night, making it an appealing option for janitorial companies to employ undocumented workers seeking clandestine employment. In the Netherlands, the number of cleaning companies grew from 5,000 in 2003 to 8,000 in 2008.Data from the employers' organisation in The Netherlands provided by EU-OSHA's Focal Point Literature review - The occupational safety and health of cleaning workers EU-OSHA - European Agency for Safety and Health at Work See also * Building superintendent * Concierge * Housekeeping * Property caretaker References Further reading *  External links  Category:Cleaning and maintenance occupations ","title":"Janitor"},{"id":"340240","text":"A set of stamps partitioned into bundles: No stamp is in two bundles, no bundle is empty, and every stamp is in a bundle. 52 partitions of a set with 5 elements. A colored region indicates a subset of X, forming a member of the enclosing partition. Uncolored dots indicate single-element subsets. The first shown partition contains five single-element subsets; the last partition contains one subset having five elements. The traditional Japanese symbols for the 54 chapters of the Tale of Genji are based on the 52 ways of partitioning five elements (the two red symbols represent the same partition, and the green symbol is added for reaching 54). In mathematics, a partition of a set is a grouping of its elements into non-empty subsets, in such a way that every element is included in exactly one subset. Every equivalence relation on a set defines a partition of this set, and every partition defines an equivalence relation. A set equipped with an equivalence relation or a partition is sometimes called a setoid, typically in type theory and proof theory.  Definition  A partition of a set X is a set of non-empty subsets of X such that every element x in X is in exactly one of these subsets (i.e., X is a disjoint union of the subsets). Equivalently, a family of sets P is a partition of X if and only if all of the following conditions hold: *The family P does not contain the empty set (that is \\\\emptyset otin P). *The union of the sets in P is equal to X (that is \\\\textstyle\\\\bigcup_{A\\\\in P} A = X). The sets in P are said to cover X. * The intersection of any two distinct sets in P is empty (that is (\\\\forall A,B \\\\in P)\\\\; A eq B \\\\implies A \\\\cap B = \\\\emptyset). The elements of P are said to be pairwise disjoint. The sets in P are called the blocks, parts or cells of the partition. The rank of P is X ‚àí P, if X is finite.  Examples  *The empty set \\\\emptyset has exactly one partition, namely \\\\emptyset. (Note: this is the partition, not a member of the partition.) *For any non-empty set X, P = {X} is a partition of X, called the trivial partition. **Particularly, every singleton set {x} has exactly one partition, namely { {x} }. *For any non-empty proper subset A of a set U, the set A together with its complement form a partition of U, namely, {A, U \\\\ A}. *The set { 1, 2, 3 } has these five partitions (one partition per item): ** { {1}, {2}, {3} }, sometimes written 123. ** { {1, 2}, {3} }, or 123. ** { {1, 3}, {2} }, or 132. ** { {1}, {2, 3} }, or 123. ** { {1, 2, 3} }, or 123 (in contexts where there will be no confusion with the number). *The following are not partitions of { 1, 2, 3 }: ** { {}, {1, 3}, {2} } is not a partition (of any set) because one of its elements is the empty set. ** { {1, 2}, {2, 3} } is not a partition (of any set) because the element 2 is contained in more than one block. ** { {1}, {2} } is not a partition of {1, 2, 3} because none of its blocks contains 3; however, it is a partition of {1, 2}.  Partitions and equivalence relations  For any equivalence relation on a set X, the set of its equivalence classes is a partition of X. Conversely, from any partition P of X, we can define an equivalence relation on X by setting precisely when x and y are in the same part in P. Thus the notions of equivalence relation and partition are essentially equivalent. The axiom of choice guarantees for any partition of a set X the existence of a subset of X containing exactly one element from each part of the partition. This implies that given an equivalence relation on a set one can select a canonical representative element from every equivalence class.  Refinement of partitions  refinement A partition Œ± of a set X is a refinement of a partition œÅ of X‚Äîand we say that Œ± is finer than œÅ and that œÅ is coarser than Œ±‚Äîif every element of Œ± is a subset of some element of œÅ. Informally, this means that Œ± is a further fragmentation of œÅ. In that case, it is written that Œ± ‚â§ œÅ. This finer-than relation on the set of partitions of X is a partial order (so the notation \\"‚â§\\" is appropriate). Each set of elements has a least upper bound and a greatest lower bound, so that it forms a lattice, and more specifically (for partitions of a finite set) it is a geometric lattice.. The partition lattice of a 4-element set has 15 elements and is depicted in the Hasse diagram on the left. Based on the cryptomorphism between geometric lattices and matroids, this lattice of partitions of a finite set corresponds to a matroid in which the base set of the matroid consists of the atoms of the lattice, namely, the partitions with n-2 singleton sets and one two-element set. These atomic partitions correspond one-for-one with the edges of a complete graph. The matroid closure of a set of atomic partitions is the finest common coarsening of them all; in graph-theoretic terms, it is the partition of the vertices of the complete graph into the connected components of the subgraph formed by the given set of edges. In this way, the lattice of partitions corresponds to the lattice of flats of the graphic matroid of the complete graph. Another example illustrates the refining of partitions from the perspective of equivalence relations. If D is the set of cards in a standard 52-card deck, the same- color-as relation on D ‚Äì which can be denoted ~C ‚Äì has two equivalence classes: the sets {red cards} and {black cards}. The 2-part partition corresponding to ~C has a refinement that yields the same-suit-as relation ~S, which has the four equivalence classes {spades}, {diamonds}, {hearts}, and {clubs}. Noncrossing partitions A partition of the set N = {1, 2, ..., n} with corresponding equivalence relation ~ is noncrossing if it has the following property: If four elements a, b, c and d of N having a < b < c < d satisfy a ~ c and b ~ d, then a ~ b ~ c ~ d. The name comes from the following equivalent definition: Imagine the elements 1, 2, ..., n of N drawn as the n vertices of a regular n-gon (in counterclockwise order). A partition can then be visualized by drawing each block as a polygon (whose vertices are the elements of the block). The partition is then noncrossing if and only if these polygons do not intersect. The lattice of noncrossing partitions of a finite set has recently taken on importance because of its role in free probability theory. These form a subset of the lattice of all partitions, but not a sublattice, since the join operations of the two lattices do not agree.  Counting partitions  The total number of partitions of an n-element set is the Bell number Bn. The first several Bell numbers are B0 = 1, B1 = 1, B2 = 2, B3 = 5, B4 = 15, B5 = 52, and B6 = 203 . Bell numbers satisfy the recursion : B_{n+1}=\\\\sum_{k=0}^n {n\\\\choose k} B_k and have the exponential generating function :\\\\sum_{n=0}^\\\\infty\\\\frac{B_n}{n!}z^n=e^{e^z-1}. Construction of the Bell triangle The Bell numbers may also be computed using the Bell triangle in which the first value in each row is copied from the end of the previous row, and subsequent values are computed by adding two numbers, the number to the left and the number to the above left of the position. The Bell numbers are repeated along both sides of this triangle. The numbers within the triangle count partitions in which a given element is the largest singleton. The number of partitions of an n-element set into exactly k non-empty parts is the Stirling number of the second kind S(n, k). The number of noncrossing partitions of an n-element set is the Catalan number Cn, given by :C_n={1 \\\\over n+1}{2n \\\\choose n}.

He has been called \\"The Painter of the Revolution\\". Trumbull's Declaration of Independence (1817), one of his four paintings which hang in the United States Capitol Rotunda, was used on the reverse of the commemorative bicentennial two-dollar bill. Early life Trumbull was born in Lebanon, Connecticut, in 1756, to Jonathan Trumbull and Faith (n√©e Robinson) Trumbull. His father served as Governor of Connecticut from 1769 to 1784. Both sides of his family were descended from early Puritan settlers in the state. He had two older brothers, Joseph Trumbull, the first commissary general of the Continental Army in the Revolutionary War, and Jonathan Trumbull Jr., who would become the second Speaker of the House of the United States. The young Trumbull entered the 1771 junior class at Harvard College at age fifteen and graduated in 1773. Due to a childhood accident, Trumbull lost the use of one eye. This may have influenced his detailed painting style. Revolutionary War As a soldier in the American Revolutionary War, Trumbull rendered a particular service at Boston by sketching plans of the British and American lines and works.Sketch of British and American Lines and Fortifications in Boston Area by John Trumbull, 1775. He witnessed the Battle of Bunker Hill. He was appointed second aide-de- camp to General George Washington, and in June 1776, deputy adjutant-general to General Horatio Gates. He resigned from the army in 1777 after a dispute over the dating of his officer commission. In 1780, with funds depleted, Trumbull turned to art as a profession. He traveled to London, where upon introduction from Benjamin Franklin, Trumbull studied under Benjamin West. At West's suggestion, Trumbull painted small pictures of the War of Independence and miniature portraits. He painted about 250 in his lifetime. On September 23, 1780, British agent Major John Andr√© was captured by Continental troops in North America; he was hanged as a spy on October 2, 1780. After news reached Great Britain, outrage flared and Trumbull was arrested, as having been an officer in the Continental Army of similar rank to Andr√©. He was imprisoned for seven months in London's Tothill Fields Bridewell. After being released, Trumbull returned to the United States in a voyage that lasted six months, ending late January 1782. He then joined his brother David in supplying the army stationed at New Windsor, New York during the winter of 1782‚Äì83. Postwar years John Trumbull, painted by Gilbert Stuart, 1818 In 1784, following Britain's recognition of the United States independence, Trumbull returned to London for painting study under West. His first major work, The Deputation from the Senate Presenting to Cincinnatus the Command of the Roman Armies, was accepted and displayed by the Royal Academy of Arts in that year. In this work, Trumbull had painted Lucius Quinctius Cincinnatus in the likeness of George Washington. The painting is now unlocated. While working in his studio, Trumbull painted Battle of Bunker Hill and Death of General Montgomery in the Attack on Quebec. Both works are now in the Yale University Art Gallery. In July 1786, Trumbull went to Paris, where he made portrait sketches of French officers for the Surrender of Lord Cornwallis. With the assistance of Thomas Jefferson, serving there as the American minister to France, Trumbull began the early composition of the Declaration of Independence. Over the next 5 years Trumbull painted small portraits of signers, which he would later use to piece together the larger painting. If the signer was deceased, a previous portrait would be copied, as was the case with Arthur Middleton, whose head position stands out in the painting. While visiting with each signer or their family, Trumbull, always looking for funding, used the occasion to sell subscriptions to engravings that would be produced from his paintings of the American Revolution. While in Paris, Trumbull is credited with having introduced Jefferson to the Italian painter Maria Cosway; they became lifelong intimate friends. Trumbull's painting of Jefferson, commissioned by Cosway, became widely known due to a later engraving of it by Asher Brown Durand, which was reproduced. Trumbull's Declaration of Independence painting was purchased by the United States Congress, along with his Surrender of General Burgoyne, Surrender of Lord Cornwallis, and General George Washington Resigning His Commission, all related to the Revolution. All now hang in rotunda of the United States Capitol. Congress reportedly authorized only funds sufficient to purchase these four paintings. Trumbull completed several other paintings related to the Revolution: *Death of General Warren at the Battle of Bunker's Hill (one version is held by the Boston Museum of Fine Arts); *Death of General Montgomery in the Attack on Quebec; *Capture of the Hessians at Trenton; *Death of General Mercer at the Battle of Princeton; *Washington at Verplanck's Point, a 1790 gift to Martha Washington; *George Washington, commissioned by the City of New York in 1790; and *The Sortie Made by the Garrison of Gibraltar, 1789. This was once owned by the Boston Athenaeum and is now held by the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City. Middle years General George Washington at Trenton, oil on canvas, 1792. Yale University Art Gallery. His portraits also include full lengths of General Washington (1790) and George Clinton (1791), now held in New York City Hall. New York City Hall also hangs Trumbull's portrait of Mayor Richard Varick, who commissioned the 1790 portrait of Washington. New York also bought his full- length paintings of Alexander Hamilton (1805, the source of the face on the $10 bill) and John Jay. In 1791 Trumbull was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. He painted portraits of John Adams (1797), Jonathan Trumbull, and Rufus King (1800); Timothy Dwight and Stephen Van Rensselaer (both at Yale), Alexander Hamilton (one in the Metropolitan Museum of Art and one in the Boston Museum of Fine Arts, both taken from Ceracchi's bust), a self-portrait (1833), a full-length of Washington, held at Charleston, South Carolina; a full-length of Washington in uniform, General George Washington at Trenton, (1792, at Yale); and portraits of President and Mrs. Washington (1794), in the National Museum of American History. Trumbull himself was painted by Gilbert Stuart and many others. In 1794 Trumbull acted as secretary to John Jay in London during the negotiation of the treaty with Great Britain, which largely settled the boundary with Canada and began cotton export. In 1796 he was appointed by the commissioners sent by the two countries as the fifth member of a commission charged with carrying out the seventh article of the Jay Treaty, which mediated claims by American and British merchants and the opposing government stemming from actions which occurred during the war. Shortly after the end of Trumbull's service on this commission, he traveled to Stuttgart to pick up the completed engraving of the Battle of Bunker's Hill. On the return trip he passed through Paris and carried the first dispatch from the XYZ Affair out of France. Trumbull would later encounter hard times during which he was failing to sell his paintings individually. In 1831, he sold a series of 28 paintings and 60 miniature portraits to Yale University for an annuity of $1,000. After many years of trying to create income from his paintings, he had finally found a way to sustain himself from his art. This is by far the largest single collection of his works. The collection was originally housed in a neoclassical art gallery designed by Trumbull on Yale's Old Campus, along with portraits by other artists. Trumbull Gallery (1832) Later years John Trumbull, painted by James FrothinghamTrumbull was appointed president of the American Academy of the Fine Arts in New York City, serving for twenty years, from 1816 to 1836. Emphasizing classical traditions, Trumbull did not get along with the students. At the same time, his painting skills declined. In 1825 many of the students withdrew, founding the National Academy of Design. Unable to accommodate to changing tastes, the American Academy later closed in 1839 after a second fire destroyed its collections. Trumbull wrote his autobiography, which he published in 1841. He died in New York City at the age of 87 on November 10, 1843.

The major membership classes are Member, Fellow - for those with significant expertise - and Companion - the most senior grade. In addition to supporting its members, the organisation encourages management development, carries out research, produces a wide variety of publications on management interests, and publishes the official members' magazine, Professional Manager. The Institute also engages with government and other public bodies concerning policy on management and business related issues. Professional Manager magazine is circulated to over 80,000 members of the CMI.  Chartered Manager (CMgr)  The Chartered Manager process requires candidates to demonstrate how they have developed as a manager and how they have applied their leadership and management skills to achieve significant business impact. There are two routes to becoming Chartered: * Exemption Route - Available to those who have completed a CMI Level 5 Diploma or above. * Qualified Route - Available to those who hold a degree level management qualification or who have minimum of five years of relevant experience. Criteria and requirements for chartered status in the UK have to be approved by the Privy Council; as such the criteria for Chartered Manager designation are \\"broadly similar\\" to chartered statuses in other fields.  History  Timeline *1945 - Sir Stafford Cripps, the President of the Board of Trade appointed a Committee, under the chairmanship of Sir Clive Baillieu (President of the Federation of British Industries - the forerunner of the CBS) to formulate detailed proposals for the establishment of a central institution for all aspects related to management. One of the reasons behind this move was the realisation that, although there were professional bodies representing functional activities, there was no comparable body for general management thinking and for the development and promotion of better management. *1947 or 1948 - Following the recommendations of the Baillieu Report, the British Institute of Management (BIM) was formed (sources differ as to the exact year). *1951 - The UK's first Diploma in Management Studies was introduced by the BIM and the Ministry of Education. *1987 - The BIM, in conjunction with other bodies, issued two pivotal reports, The making of British managers (John Constable and Roger McCormick), and The making of managers (Charles Handy). These reports led to the formation of the National Forum for Management Education and Development (NFMED) and, subsequently, the Management Charter Initiative (MCI), which spearheaded the issue of the world's first competency-based national management standards. *1992 - BIM merged with the Institution of Industrial Managers (IIM) to form the Institute of Management (IM). The awarding body status of the IIM was transferred to the new Institute. *2000 - The Institute accredited its 250th approved centre to deliver IM management qualifications. *2001 - The Institute of Interim Management was formed as a Special Interest Group within the Institute of Management. *2002 - The Institute of Management was awarded a Royal Charter and became the Chartered Management Institute. *2002 - The Institute's management qualifications were recognised as part of the UK's National Qualifications Framework for Higher Education. *2002 - The Institute of Interim Management by mutual agreement with the CMI, gained an independent status. *2003 - The Chartered Manager designation was launched. *2005 - The Institute of Management Consultancy (IMC) became an 'organisation within the Institute' *2005 ‚Äì The Institute assumed the Presidency of the European Management Association (EMA) for a three-year term *2005 - The Institute's first National Convention is held at the Queen's Hotel in Leeds *2006 ‚Äì The Institute of Business Advisers (IBA) became an 'organisation with the Institute' and discussions commenced with a view to achieving a merger between IBA and IMC by mid-2007 *2007 - National Convention held in Birmingham at the Hilton Metropole *2007 - IBA becomes IBC, the Institute of Business Consulting *2008 - Ruth Spellman is appointed Chief Executive *2008 - National Convention held in Birmingham at the Hilton Metropole *2009 - National Convention held in London at the London Hilton Metropole. *2011 - Ruth Spellman suddenly leaves CMI in August with Christopher Kinsella being appointed as interim CE *2011 - A survey of members, conducted by Huw Hilditch-Roberts, concluded that branches should be scrapped in order to improve engagement with the membership. *2012 - Ann Francke is appointed in June as Chief Executive. *2013 - New Regional Chairmen appointed and Regional Boards elected to take over from branches in October. *2014 - Mike Clasper is appointed as President  Membership  * Student - Must be studying a relevant management qualification at any level no. * Affiliate - Requires no experience or qualifications. * Associate (ACMI) - Requires a management qualification at Certificate, Diploma or S/NVQ level OR a minimum of 3 years management experience.

All three charts are compiled by the Official Charts Company (OCC). The measurements are made by collating the returns of sales from a number of well-known music stores (high street and online stores) on a regular basis, and this enables a ranking to be established. Most classical artist album sales in the UK are from crossover artists.

It is one of only three towns in the Shire of Barcoo in Central West Queensland. In the , Windorah had a population of 115 people. Geography Located downstream from where the Thomson and Barcoo Rivers join to form the multi-channelled Cooper Creek, the Shire covers an area of 60,901 km¬≤, the town has a population of 60 people, with a further 40 living at surrounding stations. A landscape of rocky outcrops, multiple sand hills and black soil flood plains make up most of the area surrounding the town. Water in the town follows the outback cycle of boom and bust. During a wet year Cooper Creek may flood more than a half a dozen times, during the dry it becomes a chain of waterholes. Downstream of the town stretches the Cooper Floodplain below Windorah Important Bird Area, identified as such by BirdLife International because of its importance for waterbirds when flooded.BirdLife International. (2011). Important Bird Areas factsheet: Cooper Floodplain Below Windorah. Downloaded from http://www.birdlife.org on 2011-12-17. History Before the onset of white colonisation, the area near and east of Windorah was inhabited by the Kulumali. The town was founded on a stock route and proclaimed in 1880. Cobb & Co once ran a stage coach service between Windorah and Adavale. It is stated that the town is named after the local Aboriginal word for \\"Big Fish\\", although according to an account of the Durack settlers, the name means high, stony place. Windorah Provisional School opened on 30 July 1888. In 1897 it became a half-time school, sharing a teacher with Cooper's Creek Provisional School, but reverted to a full-time school in 1903. In 1907, it became a half-time school with Cooper's Creek school again, and then closed in 1915. However, it reopened in 1916, only to close again in 1918. In 1926, it reopened and remains operating as Windorah State School. It celebrated its 125th Anniversary in 2013. The town was completely isolated by floodwater in 1949 after surrounding areas were inundated by heavy rainfall. Low cloud and more rain prevented relief food supplies from being delivered by air from a RAAF Dakota. At the , Windorah had a population of 158. In the 2016 census, Windorah's population had decreased to 115, with 20.5% of the population identifying as indigenous.  Climate  Windorah is diverse in many aspects. The temperature may range from maximums in summer that approach 50 ¬∞C to minimums in winter that are below 0 ¬∞C. The annual rainfall has recorded falls between a low of 86 mm and a high of 988 mm. Other weather extremes include 25 morning frosts in 1977, 10 dust storms in 1987 and four hailstorms in 1985.  Economy  Sheep and cattle grazing are the mainstay of the district; however, recently oil and gas industries have developed in the area. Many locals also work on the Shire Council and the Dingo Barrier Fence.  Education  Windorah State School opened on 30 July 1888 and celebrated its 125th Anniversary in 2013.  Attractions  Sunrise at Windorah Windorah is known as \\"The Heart of the Channel Country\\" and offers a welcome and interesting stop-off for travellers to Birdsville, Bedourie, Longreach and points West. Every year since 1998 Windorah hosts an International Yabby Race on the street outside the hotel. It is held on the Wednesday before the Birdsville Races (first weekend in September). The event raises money for the Royal Flying Doctor Service, community facilities and other charities.  Facilities Windorah has a library, racecourse, local museum, shire hall, information centre and museum. The Windorah Library is operated by the Barcoo Shire Council and located in Maryborough Street.

Leibniz's term for these substances was \\"monads\\", which he described in a popular work (Monadology ¬ß7) as \\"windowless\\". Overview Leibniz's theory is best known as a solution to the mind‚Äìbody problem of how mind can interact with the body. Leibniz rejected the idea of physical bodies affecting each other, and explained all physical causation in this way. Under pre-established harmony, the preprogramming of each mind must be extremely complex, since only it causes its own thoughts or actions, for as long as it exists. To appear to interact, each substance's \\"program\\" must contain a description of either the entire universe, or of how the object behaves at all times during all interactions that appear to occur. An example: :An apple falls on Alice's head, apparently causing the experience of pain in her mind. In fact, the apple does not cause the pain‚Äîthe pain is caused by some previous state of Alice's mind. If Alice then seems to shake her hand in anger, it is not actually her mind that causes this, but some previous state of her hand. Note that if a mind behaves as a windowless monad, there is no need for any other object to exist to create that mind's sense perceptions, leading to a solipsistic universe that consists only of that mind. Leibniz seems to admit this in his Discourse on Metaphysics, section 14. However, he claims that his principle of harmony, according to which God creates the best and most harmonious world possible, dictates that the perceptions (internal states) of each monad \\"expresses\\" the world in its entirety, and the world expressed by the monad actually exists. Although Leibniz says that each monad is \\"windowless,\\" he also claims that it functions as a \\"mirror\\" of the entire created universe. On occasion, Leibniz styled himself as \\"the author of the system of preestablished harmony\\". Leibniz Philosophischen Schriften hrsg. C. Gerhardt, Bd VI 539, 546; and also the New Essays Immanuel Kant's professor Martin Knutzen regarded pre-established harmony as \\"the pillow for the lazy mind\\".

It was produced by Robert Simonds and Jack Giarraputo. Lynn Swann, Lawrence Taylor, Jimmy Johnson, Bill Cowher, Paul \\"The Big Show\\" Wight and Rob Schneider have cameo appearances. The film was extremely profitable, earning $39.4 million in its opening weekend alone in the United States, earning a total of $190 million worldwide.  Plot  Robert \\"Bobby\\" Boucher, Jr. is a socially inept, stuttering thirty-one year-old somewhat mentally challenged water boy of the University of Louisiana football program. He lives with his overprotective and extremely religious mother, Helen, and believes his father, Robert Sr., died of dehydration in the Sahara while serving in the Peace Corps back in the end of the 1960s. As the players constantly bully Boucher, the Cougars' head coach, Red Beaulieu, fires Boucher, claiming that he has been disruptive during the 18 years of his employment. Bobby approaches Coach Klein of the South Central Louisiana State University Mud Dogs and is hired as the team's water boy. The Mud Dogs have lost forty consecutive games, their cheerleaders are alcoholics, and players are forced to share equipment due to budget cuts. When the new team teases him, Klein encourages Bobby to stand up for himself. Remembering all the bullying he has put up with over the years, Bobby tackles the team's quarterback, knocking him out. Seeing Boucher's potential, Klein meets with Helen and tries to persuade her to let Bobby play on the team, but she refuses, saying it is too dangerous. Klein convinces Bobby to play without letting Helen know, seeing that Bobby is eager to attend college. Bobby becomes a feared linebacker, with Klein telling him to visualize his enemies angering him and use the feelings for motivation. The Mud Dogs go on a winning streak. Bobby's newfound fame and confidence also allow him to reconnect with his childhood crush, Vicki Vallencourt, who has been in prison multiple times. Helen forbids Bobby from seeing her, warning him that girls (and basically everything else in pop culture) \\"is the devil\\". The team's success earns it a trip to the annual Bourbon Bowl on New Year's Day to face the Cougars and Coach Beaulieu. However, Beaulieu and his team crash the Mud Dogs' pep rally and reveal that Bobby never finished high school since he was homeschooled, and his fake high school transcript makes him ineligible for college and football. The team and fans turn against Bobby, believing him to be a liar and cheater. Coach Klein convinces NCAA to let Bobby play if he can pass a GED exam. He apologizes to Bobby and admits to submitting the fake transcript because he was desperate to get even with Beaulieu. Back in 1978 (20 years prior), Klein and Beaulieu used to be assistant coaches at the University of Louisiana. Beaulieu bullied Klein out of his playbook, took credit for his ideas, got promoted to head coach, and then fired Klein. The experience drove Klein to a mental breakdown, making him unable to come up with new plays. The story convinces Bobby to help Klein get revenge on Beaulieu and prove himself to everyone. Helen nags Bobby while he is studying for the GED, driving him to finally stand up to her once and for all. He angrily reveals that he has been playing football, going to college, and seeing Vicki, and intends to continue doing so. Bobby passes the exam, but Helen feigns a coma. Feeling he drove his mother to illness, Bobby stays in the hospital with her. Meanwhile, Vicki spreads word of Bobby passing the exam. This leads to a gathering of fans at the hospital who apologize for not supporting him and try to convince him to play. Seeing her son struggling to ignore his calling, Helen ends her fake illness. She tells Bobby his father, Robert Sr., was never in the Peace Corps, and in fact abandoned her while she was four months pregnant with Bobby to have an affair with a voodoo priestess in New Orleans. This led to Helen being constantly afraid that Bobby would leave her too. Deciding to put her son's happiness ahead of her own selfishness, she encourages him to play in the Bourbon Bowl. Arriving at halftime, Bobby finds the Mud Dogs losing, 27‚Äì0. The team apologize for not treating him with the respect he deserves. With Bobby's help, Coach Klein overcomes his fear of Beaulieu by visualizing him as various things he's not afraid of, and comes up with new plays. The Mud Dogs begin to catch up, unsettling Beaulieu, who resorts to underhanded tactics to save his and the team's honor. Helen helps by sobering up the team's cheerleaders in making coffee, while Vicki fills in for Bobby's usual waterboy duties. The Mud Dogs win the Bourbon Bowl, 30‚Äì27. Bobby is named the MVP, all to the devastation of Beaulieu and the Cougars. Beaulieu even breaks down in tears, embarrassed that his team lost and is presumably fired as head coach. Some time later, Bobby and Vicki get married. Bobby's father Robert Sr., who has since changed his name to Roberto, makes a surprise appearance to convince Bobby to skip school and go to the NFL so he can share in his son's newfound fame, citing the success of Tiger Woods and his father. He is tackled to the ground by an enraged Helen to the cheers of the attendants. Bobby and Vicki leave to consummate their marriage. Cast Production The idea for The Waterboy came from one of Sandler's Saturday Night Live characters. Sandler said \\"You could compare him to 'Canteen Boy,' whereas he does love water and they both get picked on a lot, but the thing I like the most about this character is just that he is a genuine, good person.\\" Writer Tim Herlihy said the story was intended to invert the formula of his previous films, where Sandler was an extreme character surrounded by regular people. \\"With Happy Gilmore, [...] it was a very straight world that he was the disruptive element in. The pressure was all on Adam to be funny as Happy. Whereas this was like a funhouse, crazy version of Southern college football milieu. And it was the first movie where things were funny when Adam wasn‚Äôt on screen. The pressure wasn‚Äôt even on him.\\" Herlihy could not believe their luck getting Kathy Bates to play Boucher's mother. Bates' agent did not want her to do the film, and Bates threw the script in the trash after reading some pages, not being interested in football. Her niece spotted the script and noticed Sandler's name, and convinced her to reconsider. =Filming= Despite taking place in Louisiana, The Waterboy was mostly filmed in the Central Florida and Orlando area as well as around Daytona Beach, DeLand, Florida, Lakeland, Florida, and surrounding areas. The Mud Dogs home games were filmed at Spec Martin Stadium in DeLand, Florida, home of the local high school team (the DHS Bulldogs). The classrooms and gym where Bobby takes the GED are part of Stetson University, also located in DeLand. Stetson's Carlton Student Union building is featured in the scene where Bobby is told his mother has been hospitalized. The scenes involving mama's cabin were shot on Lake Louisa, in Clermont, Florida. Coach Klein's (Henry Winkler's) office was a stage built inside of the Florida Army National Guard Armory in DeLand, Florida. It is home of Btry B 1st Bn 265th ADA. If one was to look closely, in the background of the practice field scenes, they can see the Armory and some military vehicles. The initial exterior shot of the University of Louisiana stadium was EverBank Field in Jacksonville; the interior of the stadium is actually the Camping World Stadium in Orlando, Florida. The Camping World Stadium was also the filming location for the climatic Bourbon Bowl game, while the flyover shot at the beginning of the game is of Williams-Brice Stadium at the University of South Carolina in Columbia, South Carolina. The \\"medulla oblongata\\" lecture scene was filmed at Florida Southern College in Lakeland, Florida. The extras in the scene were students at the college, and the scene was shot on campus in Edge Hall. Soundtrack The soundtrack for The Waterboy was released on November 3, 1998 by Hollywood Records. Reception =Critical response= As of August 2020, review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes reported the film had an approval rating of 34% based on 76 reviews with an average rating of 4.56/10. The site's critical consensus read: \\"The Waterboy is an insult to its genre with low humor and cheap gags.\\" On Metacritic, the film has a score of 41% based on reviews from 21 critics, indicating \\"mixed or average reviews\\". Audiences surveyed by CinemaScore gave the film a grade \\"A-\\" on scale of A to F. Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times gave the film a negative review, saying \\"Sandler is making a tactical error when he creates a character whose manner and voice has the effect of fingernails on a blackboard, and then expects us to hang in there for a whole movie.\\" Lisa Alspector of the Chicago Reader also gave the film a negative review, writing \\"Geek triumphs after all comedies can be charming, but in this one the triumphing begins so early it's hard to feel for the geek.\\" Michael O'Sullivan of The Washington Post described the movie as \\"[a]nother film about . . . a cretinous, grating loser.\\" Manohla Dargis of LA Weekly gave the film a mixed review, writing: \\"Of course it's dumb, but every 10 minutes or so, it's also pretty funny.\\" Glen Lovell of Variety wrote of the film, \\"This yahoos on the bayou farce is neither inventive nor outrageous enough.\\" David Nusair of Reel Film Reviews also gave the film a mixed review, calling it \\"an agreeable yet forgettable comedy.\\" Janet Maslin of The New York Times wrote the film was \\"so cheerfully outlandish that it's hard to resist, and so good hearted that it's genuinely endearing.\\" Mark Savlov of The Austin Chronicle also gave the film a positive review, writing that it was \\"A mildly amusing bayou farce with plenty of 'foosball' action to liven the sometimes plodding proceedings.\\" =Box office= The film grossed $161,491,646 in the United States, and a further $28,700,000 internationally, for a worldwide total of $190,191,646 worldwide, against an estimated production budget of $20 million. The film opened at number 1 at the US box office, earning $39,414,071 in its opening weekend, a record opening for November. The trailer for Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace was released alongside the film, in its second week. The film was released in the United Kingdom on April 30, 1999, and topped the country's box office that weekend. As of 2020, The Waterboy is the highest-grossing film in the sports comedy genre. =Accolades= For his role Sandler was nominated for a Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Actor. Likewise, the Stinkers Bad Movie Awards awarded him Most Annoying Fake Accent in 1998. He also won a Blockbuster Entertainment Award and a MTV Movie Award for his performance.

A member of the Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD), Bernstein had held close association to Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels, but he began to identify what he believed to be errors in Marxist thinking and began to criticize views held by Marxism when he investigated and challenged the Marxist materialist theory of history.Berman, Sheri. Social Democracy and the Making of Europe's Twentieth Century. Cambridge University Press, 2006. pp. 38‚Äì39. He rejected significant parts of Marxist theory that were based upon Hegelian metaphysics and rejected the Hegelian dialectical perspective.Michael Harrington. Socialism: Past and Future. Reprint edition of original published in 1989. New York, New York, USA: Arcade Publishing, 2011. P. 251. Bernstein distinguished between early and mature Marxism. The former, exemplified by Marx and Engels's 1848 The Communist Manifesto was opposed by Bernstein for what he regarded as its violent Blanquist tendencies. Bernstein embraced the latter, holding that socialism could be achieved by peaceful means through incremental legislative reform in democratic societies.Steger, Manfred B. The Quest for Evolutionary Socialism: Eduard Bernstein And Social Democracy. Cambridge, England, UK; New York, New York, US: Cambridge University Press, 1997. pp. 236‚Äì237.  Early life  Bernstein was born in Sch√∂neberg (now part of Berlin) to Jewish parents who were active in the Reform Temple on the Johannistrasse whose services were performed on Sunday. His father was a locomotive driver. From 1866 to 1878, he was employed in banks as a banker's clerk after leaving school. Bernstein's political career began in 1872, when he joined a socialist party with Marxist tendencies, known formally as the Social Democratic Workers' Party of Germany, a proponent of the Eisenach, named after a German town, type of German socialism. He soon became known as an activist. Bernstein's party contested two elections against a rival socialist party, the Lassalleans (Ferdinand Lassalle's General German Workers' Association), but in both elections neither party was able to win a significant majority of the left-wing vote. Consequently, Bernstein, together with August Bebel and Wilhelm Liebknecht, prepared the Einigungsparteitag (\\"Unification Party Congress\\") with the Lassalleans in Gotha in 1875. Karl Marx's famous Critique of the Gotha Program criticised what he saw as a Lassallean victory over the Eisenachers, whom he favoured. Bernstein later noted that it was Liebknecht, considered by many to be the strongest Marxist advocate within the Eisenacher faction, who proposed the inclusion of many of the ideas that so thoroughly irritated Marx. In the 1877 elections, the German Social Democratic Party (SPD) gained 493,000 votes. However, two assassination attempts on Kaiser Wilhelm I the next year provided Chancellor Otto von Bismarck a pretext to introduce a law banning all socialist organisations, assemblies and publications. There had been no Social Democratic involvement in either assassination attempt, but the popular reaction against \\"enemies of the Reich\\" induced a compliant Reichstag to approve Bismarck's Anti-Socialist Laws.The Preconditions of Socialism Eduard Bernstein Bismarck's strict anti-socialist legislation was passed on 12 October 1878. For nearly all practical purposes, the SPD was outlawed and throughout Germany, it was actively suppressed. However, it was still possible for Social Democrats to campaign as individuals for election to the Reichstag, which they did, despite the severe persecution subjected to the party, and actually increased its electoral success, gaining 550,000 votes in 1884 and 763,000 in 1887. Exile The vehemence of Bernstein's opposition to the government of Bismarck made it desirable for him to leave Germany. Shortly before the Anti-Socialist Laws came into effect, Bernstein went into exile in Zurich, accepting a position as private secretary for the social-democratic patron Karl H√∂chberg, a wealthy supporter of social democracy. A warrant subsequently issued for his arrest ruled out any possibility for him to return to Germany, and he was to remain in exile for more than 20 years. In 1888, Bismarck convinced the Swiss government to expel a number of important members of German social democracy and so Bernstein relocated to London, where he associated with Friedrich Engels and Karl Kautsky. It was soon after his arrival in Switzerland that he began to think of himself as a Marxist.Berstein, Sozialdemokratische Lehrjahre, p.72; Berstein to Bebel, 20.10.1898, Tudor and Tudor, p.324. In 1880, he accompanied Bebel to London to clear up a misunderstanding concerning his involvement with an article published by H√∂chberg that was denounced by Marx and Engels as being \\"chock-full of bourgeois and petty bourgeois ideas\\". The visit was a success, and particularly, Engels in particular was impressed by Bernstein's zeal and ideas. Back in Zurich, Bernstein became increasingly active in working for Der Sozialdemokrat (Social Democrat) and later succeeded Georg von Vollmar as the paper's editor, which he was for 10 years. It was during those years between 1880 and 1890 that Bernstein established his reputation as a major party theoretician and a Marxist of impeccable orthodoxy. He was helped in that by the close personal and professional relationship he established with Engels. The relationship owed much to the fact that he shared Engels's strategic vision and accepted most of the particular policies that Engels believed the ideas to entail. In 1887, the German government persuaded the Swiss authorities to ban Der Sozialdemokrat. Bernstein moved to London, where he resumed publication from premises in Kentish Town. His relationship with Engels soon developed into friendship. He also communicated with various English socialist organizations, notably the Fabian Society and Henry Mayers Hyndman's Social Democratic Federation.This influence is particularly evident in Bernstein's My Years of Exile: Reminiscences of a Socialist (London, 1921). In later years, his opponents routinely claimed that his \\"revisionism\\" was caused by seeing the world \\"through English spectacles\\". However, Bernstein denied the charges.Bernstein to Bebel, 20.10.1898, Tudor and Tudor, pp. 325-6. In 1895, Engels was deeply distressed when he discovered that his introduction to a new edition of The Class Struggles in France, written by Marx in 1850, had been edited by Bernstein and Kautsky in a manner that left the impression that he had become a proponent of a peaceful road to socialism. On 1 April 1895, four months before his death, Engels wrote to Kautsky: > I was amazed to see today in the Vorw√§rts an excerpt from my 'Introduction' > that had been printed without my knowledge and tricked out in such a way as > to present me as a peace-loving proponent of legality quand m√™me (at all > costs). Which is all the more reason why I should like it to appear in its > entirety in the Neue Zeit in order that this disgraceful impression may be > erased. I shall leave Liebknecht in no doubt as to what I think about it and > the same applies to those who, irrespective of who they may be, gave him > this opportunity of perverting my views and, what's more, without so much as > a word to me about it. In 1891, Bernstein was one of the authors of the Erfurt Program and from 1896 to 1898, he published a series of articles entitled Probleme des Sozialismus (Problems of Socialism) that resulted in the revisionism debate in the SPD.Wolfgang Eichhorn: √úber Eduard Bernstein. Gegensatz und Ber√ºhrungspunkte zu Rosa Luxemburg und W. I. Lenin, in: Jahrbuch f√ºr Forschungen zur Geschichte der Arbeiterbewegung, No. I/2002. He also published the book Die Voraussetzungen des Sozialismus und die Aufgaben der Sozialdemokratie (The Prerequisites for Socialism and the Tasks of Social Democracy) in 1899. The book was in great contrast to the positions of Bebel, Kautsky and Liebknecht. Rosa Luxemburg's 1900 essay Reform or Revolution? was also a polemic against Bernstein's position. In 1900, Berstein published Zur Geschichte und Theorie des Sozialismus (The History and Theory of Socialism). Return to Germany The USPD board on 5 December 1919 included Bernstein. In 1901, Bernstein returned to Germany after the end of the ban that had kept him from entering the country. He became an editor of the newspaper Vorw√§rts that year and a member of the Reichstag from 1902 to 1918. He voted against the armament tabling in 1913, together with the SPD fraction's left wing. Although he voted for war credits in August 1914, he opposed World War I from July 1915 and, in 1917, was among the founders of the Independent Social Democratic Party of Germany (USPD), which united antiwar socialists, including reformists like Bernstein, centrists like Kautsky and revolutionary socialists like Karl Liebknecht. He was a member of the USDP until 1919, when he rejoined the SPD. From 1920 to 1928, Bernstein was again a member of the Reichstag. He retired from political life in 1928. Death and legacy Bernstein died on 18 December 1932 in Berlin. A commemorative plaque is placed in his memory at Bozener Stra√üe 18, Berlin-Sch√∂neberg, where he lived from 1918 until his death. His grave in the Eisackstrasse Cemetery became a grave of honour () in Berlin.  Opinions  = Opposition to violent revolution = Die Voraussetzungen des Sozialismus (1899) was Bernstein's most significant work. Bernstein was principally concerned with refuting Karl Marx's predictions about the imminent and inevitable demise of capitalism and Marx's consequent laissez-faire policy which opposed ameliorative social interventions before the demise. Bernstein indicated simple facts, which he considered to be evidence that Marx's predictions were not being borne out while he noted that while the centralisation of capitalist industry was significant, it was not becoming wholescale and that the ownership of capital was becoming more and not less diffuse.Die Voraussetzungen des Sozialismus (1899) Bernstein's analysis of agriculture, according to which Bernstein believed that land ownership was becoming less concentrated, was largely based on the work of Eduard David and was in its marshalling of facts impressive enough that even his Orthodox Marxist opponent Karl Kautsky acknowledged its value. As to Marx's belief in the disappearance of the middleman, Bernstein declared that the entrepreneur class was being steadily recruited from the proletariat class and so all compromise measures, such as the state regulation of the hours of labour and provisions for old-age pensions should be encouraged. For that reason, Bernstein urged the labouring classes to take an active interest in politics. Bernstein also indicated what he considered to be some of the flaws in Marx's labour theory of value. Looking especially at the rapid growth in Germany, Bernstein argued that middle-sized firms would flourish, the size and power of the middle class would grow and that capitalism would successfully adjust and not collapse. He warned that a violent proletarian revolution, as in France in 1848, produced only reactionary successes, which undermined workers' interests. Therefore, he rejected revolution and instead insisted the best strategy to be patiently building up a durable social movement working for continuous nonviolent incremental change. Richard A. Fletcher, \\"Cobden as Educator: The Free-Trade Internationalism of Eduard Bernstein, 1899-1914.\\" American Historical Review 88.3 (1983): 563-68. In his work, The Quest for Evolutionary Socialism: Eduard Bernstein and Social Democracy, Manfred Steger touches on Bernstein's desire for socialism through peaceful means and incremental legislation. Some say that is Marxism in its mature form after the revisionists said claimed many of Marx's theories to be wrong and came up with theories of their own, including socialism coming through democratic means. =Bernstein's moderation under attack= Bernstein was vilified by the orthodox Marxists as well as the more radical current led by Rosa Luxemburg for his revisionism.Peter Gay, The Dilemma of Democratic Socialism: Eduard Bernstein's challenge to Marx (1952) p 258ff Nonetheless, Bernstein remained very much a socialist, albeit an unorthodox one as he believed that socialism would be achieved by capitalism, not by capitalism's destruction (as rights were gradually won by workers, their cause for grievance would be diminished and consequently, so too would the motivation for revolution). During the intra-party debates about his ideas, Bernstein explained that for him the final goal of socialism was nothing; progress toward that goal was everything. Luxemburg argued that socialism has its end in social revolution and revisionism \\"amounts in practice to the advice [...] that we abandon the social revolution‚Äîthe goal of Social Democracy‚Äîand turn social reform from a means of the class struggle into its final aim\\".Gay, The Dilemma of Democratic Socialism: Eduard Bernstein's challenge to Marx (1952) p 259 She says revisionism has lost sight of scientific socialism and reverted to idealism and therefore lost its predictive force. Since reformists underestimate the anarchy of capitalism and say it has adaptability and viability, by which they mean that the contradictions of capitalism would not of historical necessity drive it to its doom, Luxemburg said they would abandon the objective necessity for socialism and give up all hope for a socialist future. The movement would collapse unless revisionism is repudiated. Trade unionists, who could see the successes of capitalism and the improvement of working conditions and who wanted to improve working conditions through parliament, generally followed Bernstein while those who were more orthodox hardliners generally followed Luxemburg.Gay, The Dilemma of Democratic Socialism: Eduard Bernstein's challenge to Marx (1952) p 260 = Foreign policy = Foreign policy was Bernstein's main intellectual interest between 1902 and 1914, with many articles in the Sozialistische Monatshefte (Socialist Monthly). He advocated policies positions for Germany that were aggressively nationalist, imperialist and expansionist. Roger Fletcher, \\"In the interest of peace and progress: Eduard Bernstein's socialist foreign policy.\\" Review of International Studies 9.2 (1983): 79-93.Roger Fletcher, \\"Revisionism and Wilhelmine Imperialism\\" Journal of Contemporary History (1988) 23#3 pp 347-366. online Bernstein considered protectionism (high tariffs on imports) as helping only a selective few, being fortschrittsfeindlich (anti- progressive) for its negative effects on the masses. He argued Germany's protectionism was based only on political expediency, isolating Germany from the world (especially from Britain), creating an autarky that would result only in conflict between Germany and the rest of the world. Bernstein wanted to end Germany's protectionism and argued that tariffs did not increase grain production, did not counter British competition, did not increase farm profits and did not promote improvements in farming. Instead, it inflated rents, interest rates and prices, hurting everyone involved. In contrast, he argued that free trade led to peace, democracy, prosperity and the highest material and moral well-being of all humanity.Fletcher, \\"Cobden as Educator\\" 563-69. Bernstein rejected reactionary bourgeois nationalism and called instead for a cosmopolitan-libertarian nationalism. He recognized the historical role of the national factor and said that the proletariat must support their country against external dangers. He called on workers to assimilate themselves within nation-states, which entailed support for colonial policies and imperial projects. Bernstein was sympathetic to the idea of imperial expansions as a positive and civilizing mission, which resulted in a bitter series of polemics with the anti-imperialist Ernest Belfort Bax. Bernstein supported colonialism as it uplifted backward peoples and it worked well for both Britain and Germany. Bernstein supported such policies in an intensely racialised manner, arguing in 1896 that \\"races who are hostile to or incapable of civilisation cannot claim our sympathy when they revolt against civilisation\\" and that the \\"savages [must] be subjugated and made to conform to the rules of higher civilisation\\".Mcgeever, Brendan, and Satnam Virdee. \\"Antisemitism and Socialist Strategy in Europe, 1880‚Äì1917: An Introduction.\\" Patterns of Prejudice 51.3-4 (2017): 229 However, he was disturbed by the Kaiser's reckless policies. He wanted strong friendship especially with Britain and France and protection against the Russian threat to Germany. He envisioned a sort of league of nations.Roger Fletcher, \\"Revisionism ad Wilhelmine Imperialism\\" Journal of Contemporary History (11988) 23#3 pp 347-366.

He never identified as a Zionist, but after initially favouring a wholly assimilationist solution to \\"the Jewish Question\\", his attitude toward Zionism became considerably more sympathetic after World War I. Bernstein is also noted for being \\"one of the first socialists to deal sympathetically with the issue of homosexuality\\". Works  * Ferdinand Lassalle as a Social Reformer.

Elephantine ( ;Merriam-Webster's Geographical Dictionary, Third Edition (Merriam-Webster, 1997; ), p. 351. ; ; Elephant√≠ne; (∆è)i√™w) is an island on the Nile, forming part of the city of Aswan in Upper Egypt. There are archaeological sites on the island. Geography Verdant Elephantine Island, opposite Assuan, Egypt\\", 1908. Lantern slide. Brooklyn Museum Edwin Howland Blashfield. Brooklyn Museum Elephantine is from north to south, and is across at its widest point. The layout of this and other nearby islands in Aswan can be seen from west bank hillsides along the Nile. The island is located just downstream of the First Cataract, at the southern border of Upper Egypt with Lower Nubia. This region above is referred to as Upper Egypt because it is further up the Nile. The island may have received its name after its shape, which in aerial views is similar to that of an elephant tusk, or from the rounded rocks along the banks resembling elephants. Ancient Egypt Known to the ancient Egyptians as Íú£bw \\"Elephant\\" (Middle Egyptian: ‚Üí Medio- Late Egyptian: ‚Üí Coptic: (‚≤à)‚≤ì‚≤è‚≤É , preserved in its Hebrew name, ◊ô÷µ◊ë 'yev'), the island of Elephantine stood at the border between Egypt and Nubia. It was an excellent defensive site for a city and its location made it a natural cargo transfer point for river trade. This border is near the Tropic of Cancer, the most northerly latitude at which the sun can appear directly overhead at noon and from which it appears to reverse direction or \\"turn back\\" at the solstices. Elephantine was a fort that stood just before the First Cataract of the Nile. During the Second Intermediate Period (1650‚Äì1550 BC), the fort marked the southern border of Egypt.Ian Shaw, Ed, Oxford History of Ancient Egypt, New York, 2000, page 206 According to ancient Egyptian religion, Elephantine was the dwelling place of Khnum, the ram-headed god of the cataracts, who guarded and controlled the waters of the Nile from caves beneath the island. He was worshipped here as part of a late triad of Egyptian deities. This \\"Elephantine Triad\\" included Satis and Anuket. Satis was worshipped from very early times as a war goddess and protector of this strategic region of Egypt. When seen as a fertility goddess, she personified the bountiful annual flooding of the Nile, which was identified as her daughter, Anuket. The cult of Satis originated in the ancient city of Aswan. Later, when the triad was formed, Khnum became identified as her consort and, thereby, was thought of as the father of Anuket. His role in myths changed later and another deity was assigned his duties with the river. At that time his role as a potter enabled him to be assigned a duty in the creation of human bodies. Temple of Khnum =Archaeological sites= Ongoing excavations by the German Archaeological Institute at the town have uncovered many findings, on display in the Aswan Museum located on the island, including a mummified ram of Khnum. Artifacts dating back to prehistoric Egypt have been found on Elephantine. A rare calendar, known as the Elephantine Calendar of Things, which dates to the reign of Thutmose III during the Eighteenth Dynasty, was found in fragments on the island. In ancient times the island was also an important stone quarry, providing granite for monuments and buildings all over Egypt. Temples Prior to 1822, there were temples to Thutmose III and Amenhotep III on the island. At that time they were destroyed during the campaign of Muhammad Ali, who had taken power in Egypt, to conquer Sudan. Both temples were relatively intact prior to the deliberate demolition. The first temple was the Temple of Satet, it was founded around 3000 BC and enlarged and renovated over the next 3,000 years. There are records of an Egyptian temple to Khnum on the island as early as the Third Dynasty. This temple was completely rebuilt in the Late Period, during the Thirtieth Dynasty of Egypt, just before the foreign rule that followed in the Graeco-Roman Period. The Greeks formed the Ptolemaic dynasty during their three-hundred- year rule over Egypt (305‚Äì30 BC) and maintained the ancient religious customs and traditions, while often associating the Egyptian deities with their own. Most of the present day southern tip of the island is taken up by the ruins of the Temple of Khnum. These, the oldest ruins still standing on the island, are composed of a granite step pyramid from the Third Dynasty and a small temple built for the local Sixth Dynasty nomarch, Heqaib. In the Middle Kingdom, many officials, such as the local governors Sarenput I or Heqaib III, dedicated statues and shrines into the temple. The Aswan Museum, and a nilometer (lower left) Nilometers A nilometer was a structure for measuring the Nile River's clarity and the water level during the annual flood season. There are two nilometers at Elephantine Island. The more famous is a corridor nilometer associated with the Temple of Satis, with a stone staircase that descends the corridor. It is one of the oldest nilometers in Egypt, last reconstructed in Roman times and still in use as late as the nineteenth century AD. Ninety steps that lead down to the river are marked with Arabic, Roman, and hieroglyphic numerals. Visible at the water's edge are inscriptions carved deeply into the rock during the Seventeenth Dynasty. The other Nilometer is a rectangular basin located at the island's southern tip, near the Temple of Khnum and opposite the Old Cataract Hotel. It is probably the older of the two. One of the nilometers, though it is not certain which, is mentioned by the Greek historian Strabo. Many sources claim that the fabled \\"Well of Eratosthenes\\", famous in connection with Eratosthenes' presumed calculation of the Earth's circumference, was located on the island. Strabo mentions a well that was used to observe that Aswan lies on the Tropic of Cancer, but the reference is to a well at Aswan, not at Elephantine. Neither nilometer at Elephantine is suitable for the purpose, while the well at Aswan is apparently lost. Jewish presence Remains of the temple to Yahweh at Elephantine. Much of the foundation is lost as the ground to the west of the site has fallen away. The Elephantine papyri are caches of legal documents and letters written in Aramaic dating to sometime in the 5th century BC. These papyri document the presence starting in the 7th century BCE of a community of Judean mercenaries and their families on Elephantine who guarded the frontier between Egypt and Nubia to the south. Following the Babylonian destruction of Jerusalem in the 6th century BCE, some Judean refugees traveled south and, in what may be called an ‚Äúexodus in reverse,‚Äù settled on Elephantine. They maintained their own temple (also see House of Yahweh), in which sacrifices were offered, evincing polytheistic beliefs, which functioned alongside that of Khnum.A. van Hoonacker, Une Communaut√© Jud√©o-Aram√©enne √† √âl√©phantine, en Egypte, aux vi et v si√®cles avant J.-C, London 1915 cited, Arnold Toynbee, A Study of History, vol.5, (1939) 1964 p125 n.1 The temple was destroyed in 410 BC at the instigation of the priests of Khnum. The temple may have been built in reaction to Manasseh's reinstitution of pagan worship or simply to serve the needs of the Jewish community. Other features Nubian houses on central Elephantine Island The Aswan Museum is located at the southern end of the island. Ongoing excavations by the German Archaeological Institute at the island's ancient town site have uncovered many findings that are now on display in the museum, including a mummified ram of Khnum. A sizable population of Nubians live in three villages in the island's middle section. A large luxury hotel is at the island's northern end.

The Irish language (also known as Irish Gaelic) () is a recognised minority language in Northern Ireland. The dialect spoken there is known as Ulster Irish (Gaeilge Uladh). Protection for the Irish language in Northern Ireland stems largely from the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages.http://www.coe.int/t/dg4/education/minlang/ According to the 2011 UK Census, in Northern Ireland 184,898 (10.65%) claim to have some knowledge of Irish, of whom 104,943 (6.05%) can speak the language to varying degrees. Some 4,130 people (0.2%) use Irish as their main home language. History =Language in Gaelic Ireland= As in other parts of Ireland, Irish was the main language in the region of present-day Northern Ireland for most of its recorded history. The historic influence of the Irish language in Northern Ireland can be seen in many place names, for example the name of Belfast first appears in the year 668, and the Lagan even earlier. The Plantation of Ulster led to a decline in Gaelic culture, of which Irish was part ‚Äì while some Scottish settlers were Gaelic speakers, English was made widespread by the plantation. Despite the plantation Gaelic continued to be spoken in non-planted areas until the mass migration in the 19th century caused by economic factors (see below for further). =Gaelic Revival in the North= Intellectuals in Belfast took an antiquarian interest in Irish- language culture towards the end of the 18th century, and an Irish-language magazine Bolg an tSolair was published in 1795. The Ulster Gaelic Society was founded in 1830. Attitudes among the Presbyterian middle class, however, tended to change in the second half of the 19th century as the Gaelic Revival became associated with support for Home Rule or Irish Republicanism. The English-born MP for South Londonderry, Thomas Lea proposed an amendment to the draft of the second Home Rule Bill that would have prevented the passing of laws which would increase Irish language use in state schools, legal courts and other public spheres. Retrieved on 7 April 2018. A branch of the Gaelic League was founded in Belfast in 1895 with a non-sectarian and widely based membership, but the decline in Irish as a first language continued.Belfast and the Irish language, ed. Fionnt√°n De Br√∫n, Dublin 2006 Irish was in sharp decline throughout the whole of Ireland from the mid-1800s. From the late 1600s and early 1700s, the Church of Ireland made some attempts to revive the declining Gaelic language. The church printed Bibles and Prayer Books in Gaelic, and some churches, and some Protestant clergymen like William King of Dublin, held services in the language. However, the English language had been the language of learning and the Roman Catholic Church continued to use Latin and English in its services. English was the language of the industrial east of the island, and Gaelic started to become confined to the more rural west. By the 1860s, of all the Roman Catholic seminaries, only St Jarlath's in Tuam was teaching in Irish. The Roman Catholic Church had, at that time, desired to \\"stamp out any lingering, semi-pagan remnants\\", which included the Irish language. Sir William Wilde in 1852 blamed the Catholic Church for the quick decline and was \\"shocked\\" by the decline of the language and Gaelic customs after the Famine. The power of the English language, in business and learning throughout much of the world also influenced the decline of Gaelic in Ireland. A letter from Dennis Heraghty of Letterkenny in 1886 to the Society for the Preservation of the Irish Language complained that the parents in his area all wanted their children to learn English. Bishop MacCormac of Achonry, also in 1886, suggested that \\"People are apathetic about the preservation of our ancient language\\" and, \\"They see that Shakespeare's tongue is the one in use in America and the Colonies.\\" Although there had been attempts and societies formed to reverse the declining trend for the language, it was not until the rise of the Gaelic League, founded in 1893, that any measure of success was achieved. By the 1851 census, only 23% of the population of Ireland still spoke Gaelic as a first language. Douglas Hyde, in New York in 1905, said, \\"The Irish language, thank God, is neither Protestant nor Catholic, it is neither a Unionist nor a Separatist.\\" By then, however, the language had begun to be politicised. The Roman Catholic Church in Ireland began to believe in the worth of the language and had begun to take steps to ensure its survival. Ironically, however, both the state and Church interference became something that Irish people began to resent. Protestants and Unionists alike began to back away from a Gaelic revival as, besides the dominant role of the Roman Catholic Church by then, Gaelic was starting to be described as a \\"race\\" and as a divisive element politically and culturally. James Alexander Rentoul, MP for Down East, stated at Westminster in July 1900 that the Irish language had no value and should not receive any support by the public education system, he stated that Irish-speaking children should be taught exclusively through English and expressed a desire for the Irish language to become extinct. Even so, in 1905 the Irish Unionist Party had a Gaelic slogan, which it proudly displayed at a convention. The controllers of the Intermediate Board, the organisation through which public education policy was implemened, attempted to frustrate the improvement of Irish language education provision so severely that the sitting Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, John Hamilton-Gordon, had to write to the Board on 25 July 1906 to see that progress was implemented. In response, John Lonsdale, MP for Mid Armagh and member of the Ulster Unionist Council, claimed that the Gaelic movement which supported the Irish language was simply inspired by hatred of England and all things English. He opposed any teaching of Irish in primary schools as \\"money wasted\\" and \\"useless\\" as well as claiming that Irish was a vehicle for the dissemination of \\"seditious views.\\" =Since the partition of Ireland= Following the partition of Ireland into the Irish Free State and Northern Ireland (which remained part of the United Kingdom), the largest Irish-speaking area in the former Province of Ulster; County Donegal; had gone into the Irish Free State. However, there were Gaeltacht areas (communities who continued to speak Irish as their first language) in Northern Ireland at the time; the most prominent of these were the Sperrin Mountains in County Tyrone and Rathlin Island in County Antrim. Since 1921, the Irish language has been regarded with suspicion by many unionists in Northern Ireland, who have associated it with the Republic of Ireland and with Irish republicanism. The Irish-language movement in Northern Ireland after 1921 responded to a lack of establishment support by pursuing a self-help social and recreational movement aimed at preserving Ulster Irish (an issue which had split the Belfast Gaelic League in 1911). By 1923, only one branch of the Gaelic League was left in operation in Northern Ireland, but from a handful of branches in 1926 the number of branches peaked at 182 in 1946. In contrast to the perception of the Irish Free State's policy of preserving areas of Irish-speaking countryside, activists in Northern Ireland concentrated on ensuring Irish could survive in urban contexts, organising trips to Irish-speaking areas to bolster urban enthusiasm. A co-operative housing scheme in Belfast aimed at creating an urban Gaeltacht opened in 1969 in Shaw's Road. From the early years of the Northern Ireland government, education in Irish was marginalised. The number of primary schools teaching Irish was halved between 1924 and 1927, and numbers studying Irish as an extra subject fell from 5531 to 1290 between 1923 and 1926. The subsidy for Irish as an extra subject was abolished in 1934.Irish in Belfast, 1892‚Äì1960, Aod√°n Mac P√≥ilin, in Belfast and the Irish language, ed. Fionnt√°n De Br√∫n, Dublin 2006 The Troubles exacerbated the politicisation of the Irish language in Northern Ireland.

Status Official administrative identity in English, Irish and Ulster Scots Most Irish speakers in Ulster today speak the Donegal dialect of Ulster Irish. Irish received official recognition in Northern Ireland for the first time in 1998 under the Good Friday Agreement. A cross-border body known as Foras na Gaeilge was established to promote the language in both Northern Ireland and the Republic, taking over the functions of Bord na Gaeilge. The British government in 2001 ratified the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages. Irish (in respect only of Northern Ireland) was specified under Part III of the Charter, thus giving it a degree of protection and status comparable to the Scottish Gaelic in Scotland. This included a range of specific undertakings in relation to education, translation of statutes, interaction with public authorities, the use of placenames, media access, support for cultural activities and other matters. (A lower level of recognition was accorded to the Ulster variant of Scots, under Part II of the Charter.) Compliance with the state's obligations is assessed periodically by a Committee of Experts of the Council of Europe.Council of Europe Charter monitoring report, 2010 Bilingual welcome sign Newry The Education (Northern Ireland) Order 1998 states: \\"It shall be the duty of the Department (of Education) to encourage and facilitate the development of Irish-medium education.\\" According to the 2001 Census, 658,103 people (36% of the population) had \\"some knowledge of Irish\\" ‚Äì of whom 559,670 were Catholics and 48,509 were Protestants and \\"other Christians\\".

Education Sign of an Irish medium school in Newry Six families in Belfast established a Gaeltacht area in Belfast in the late 1960s and opened Bunscoil Phobal Feirste in 1970 as the first Irish-medium school in Northern Ireland, and in 1984 was granted the status of a voluntary maintained primary school. The first Na√≠scoil (Irish-medium nursery school) opened in 1978. Not long after the opening of Bunscoil Phobal Feirste, a second all-irish primary school opened, Gaelscoil na bhF√°l, situated on the Falls Road. Founded by the parents of children that wanted Irish education but couldn't find a space in 'BPF', one of the parents, named Sue Pentel, played a major role in the making of the school and about two years after the opening of Gaelscoil na bhF√°l, a daycare service, Ionad U√≠bh Eachach, was opened and founded and managed by Sue Pentel. The school and daycare both provide services through the Irish language and work together in the way that many of the children that attended Ionad U√≠bh Eachach then go on to attend nursery- Primary 7 (Na√≠ ionad- R7) in Gaelscoil na bhF√°l. This is a very valuable connection that not that many schools have and what with the Ionad providing after-school care it is both convenient for the school and parents. Comhairle na Gaelscola√≠ochta (CnaG) is the representative body for Irish-medium Education. It was set up in 2000 by the Department of Education to promote, facilitate and encourage Irish-medium Education. One of CnaG's central objectives is to seek to extend the availability of Irish-medium Education to parents who wish to avail of it for their children. Irish language pre-schools and primary schools are now thriving and there are official Irish language streams in secondary schools in Maghera, Donaghmore, Castlewellan and Armagh. In December 2014 Minister for Education for Northern Ireland John O'Dowd announced that the Department of Education were going to set up Northern Ireland's second gaelchol√°iste in Dungiven Castle in County Londonderry.http://www.deni.gov.uk/news/news-de-101214-odowd-approves- proposal.htm Dept. of Education press release (December 2014) Gaelchol√°iste Dhoire opened in September 2015.

BBC Radio Ulster began broadcasting a nightly half-hour programme, called Blas ('taste'), in Irish in the early 1980s, and there is now an Irish-language programme on the station every day. BBC Northern Ireland broadcast its first television programme in Irish in the early 1990s, SRL ('etc.'). In March 2005, TG4 began broadcasting from the Divis transmitter near Belfast, as a result of agreement between the Department of Foreign Affairs and the Northern Ireland Office. Following Digital Switchover for terrestrial television transmissions in both parts of Ireland in 2012, TG4 is now carried on Freeview HD for viewers in Northern Ireland (channel 51) as well as to those households in Border areas that have spillover reception of the ROI Saorview platform (channel 104). TG4 also continues to be available on other TV delivery platforms across Northern Ireland: Sky (channel 163) and Virgin Cable customers in Belfast (channel 877). RT√â's Irish-language radio station, RT√â Raidi√≥ na Gaeltachta based in the Republic of Ireland is also available in many areas in Northern Ireland. Raidi√≥ F√°ilte a community radio station based in West Belfast covers the Greater Belfast area and started broadcasting in 2006 and broadcasts 24 hours per day seven days per week. It broadcasts a selection of programmes; music, chat, news, current affairs, sports, arts, literature, environmental and community issues. It is also available worldwide on the internet at Raidi√≥F√°ilte.com.Radi√≥ F√°ilte.com Residents of Northern Ireland have access to web based media in Irish such as online newspaper Tuairisc.ie or online lifestyle magazine N√≥s. An Irish-language daily newspaper called L√° Nua (\\"new day\\") folded in 2008 due to lack of funding. The Northern Ireland Film and Television Commission administers an Irish Language Broadcast Fund (announced by the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland in April 2004) to foster and develop an independent Irish-language television production sector in Northern Ireland. The European Commission authorised public funding for the fund in June 2005 considering that \\"since the aid aims to promote cultural products and the Irish Language, it can be authorised under EU Treaty rules that allow state aids for the promotion of culture\\". Political use The Irish language in Northern Ireland has long been a matter associated with identity. Prior to the turn of the 20th Century, the Irish language was embraced by both sides of the community, although in decline. But the partition of Ireland in 1921 was a turning point to attitudes towards the language. Nationalists in Northern Ireland who had been abandoned by their southern counterparts felt that the Irish language was a significant marker of identity they now needed as a minority group. During The Troubles the Irish language became increasingly politicised. Its survival is largely due to families in the nationalist Shaw's Road area of west Belfast during the 1960s who tried to make the area Gaeltacht (an Irish speaking area). A second wave of the Irish language revival movement in Northern Ireland during the 1970s occurred on another site ‚Äì the Maze Prison. For republican prisoners, learning the Irish language in prison (aka 'Jailtacht') became the way in which to set themselves apart from the British authorities. More widely, this use of the Irish language inspired many nationalists in Northern Ireland to use the language as a form of cultural expression and resistance from the British occupation. In particular, the Irish language has been used extensively by the republican party Sinn F√©in who have been criticised by unionists for hijacking the Irish language for political gain. The use of the Irish language by republicans has therefore led to it receiving mixed responses from unionist communities and politicians. In many unionist communities the Irish language is regarded as a foreign language or the language of terrorists and therefore ‚Äì unlike Catholic communities ‚Äì in Protestant communities its inclusion in school curriculum and public notices continues to be strongly opposed. On the other hand, some moderate nationalists have been reluctant to use Irish too due to the negative connotations associated with the language's use. The issue around the use of the Irish language was once again intensified when a unionist MLA was accused of mocking Irish in the Northern Irish Assembly. In November 2014, in response to a question about minority language policy the DUP's Gregory Campbell said \\"Curry my yoghurt can coca coalyer\\" in what was meant to sound like \\"Thank you, speaker\\" in Irish which he later claimed was in an attempt to make a point about the continued political use of the language by some Sinn F√©in MLAs in post 1998 Good Friday Agreement. In recent years cross-community efforts have been made to make the Irish language more appealing to both sides of the community. Many local councils now use Irish bilingually with English (sometimes with Ulster Scots too) on many of its services in an attempt to neutralise the language. Some former loyalist prisoners such as Robin Stewart have even taken up learning the Irish language in east Belfast in an attempt to reclaim Irish identity and challenge Republicans about their version of Irish history and what it means to be Irish. The former Red Hand Commando prisoner William Smith learnt the language whilst in jail.Martin McGuinness tribute to Ex-Red Hand Commando William 'Plum' Smith following death The motto of the Red Hand Commando was the Irish phrase Lamh Dhearg Abu which translated means 'Red Hand to Victory'. Linda Ervine, the sister-in-law of former Ulster Volunteer Force member and politician David Ervine, began learning the language and set up the Turas Irish-Language Project in the predominately Unionist East Belfast area for others to learn the language in 2011.

It is typically present on the majority of large civil jet aircraft, as well as most large military planes. The stick shaker comprises a key component of an aircraft's stall protection system. Several accidents, such as the 1963 BAC One-Eleven test crash and American Airlines Flight 191, were attributable to aerodynamic stalls and motivated aviation regulatory bodies to establish requirements for certain aircraft to be outfitted with stall protection measures, such as the stick shaker and stick pusher, to reduce such occurrences. While the stick shaker has become relatively prevalent amongst airliners and large transport aircraft, such devices are not infallible and require flight crews to be appropriately trained on their functionality and how to respond to their activation. Several instances of aircraft entering stalls have occurred even with properly functioning stick shakers, largely due to pilots having improperly reacted. History During 1963, a BAC One-Eleven airliner was lost after having crashed during a stall test. The pilots pushed the T-tailed plane past the limits of stall recovery and entered a deep stall state, in which the disturbed air from the stalled wing had rendered the elevator ineffective, directly leading to a loss of control and crash.Report on the Accident to B.A.C. One-Eleven G-ASHG at Cratt Hill, near Chicklade, Wiltshire on 22nd October 1963, Ministry of Aviation C.A.P. 219, 1965. As a consequence of the crash, a combined stick shaker/pusher system was installed in all production BAC One-Eleven airliners. A wider consequence of the incident was the instatement of a new requirement related to the pilot's ability to identify and overcome stall conditions; a design of Transport category aircraft that fails to comply with the specifics of this requirement may be acceptable if the aircraft is equipped with a stick pusher. Following the crash of American Airlines Flight 191 on 25 May 1979, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) issued an airworthiness directive, which mandated the installation and operation of stick shakers on both sets of flight controls on most models of the McDonnell Douglas DC-10, a trijet airliner. In addition to regulatory pressure, various aircraft manufacturers have endeavoured to devise their own improved stall protection systems, many of which have included the stick shaker. The American aerospace company Boeing had designed and integrated stall warning systems into numerous aircraft that it has produced. A wide range of aircraft have incorporated stick shakers into their cockpits. Textron Aviation's Citation Longitude business jet is one such example, as is the Pilatus PC-24 light business jet, and Bombardier Aviation's Challenger 600 family of business jets. Commercial airliners such as the newer models of the Boeing 737, the Boeing 767, and the Embraer E-Jet E2 family have also included stick shakers in the aircraft's stall protection systems. The stick shaker is a major element of an aircraft's stall protection system. The system is composed of fuselage or wing-mounted angle of attack (AOA) sensors that are connected to an avionics computer, which receives inputs from the AOA sensors along with a variety of other flight systems. When this data indicates an imminent stall condition, the computer actuates both the stick shaker and an auditory alert. The shaker itself is composed of an electric motor connected to a deliberately unbalanced flywheel. When actuated, the shaker induces a forceful, noisy, and entirely unmistakable shaking of the control yoke. This shaking of the control yoke matches the frequency and amplitude of the stick shaking that occurs due to airflow separation in low-speed aircraft as they approach the stall. The stick shaking is intended to act as a backup to the auditory stall alert, in cases where the flight crew may be distracted. Other stall protection systems include the stick pusher, a device that automatically pushes forward on the control yoke, commanding a reduction in the aircraft's angle of attack and thus preventing the aircraft from entering a full stall. In the majority of circumstances, the stick pusher will not activate until shortly after the stick shaker has given its warning of near-stall conditions being detected, and won't activate if the flight crew have performed appropriate actions to reduce the likelihood of stalling by lowering the angle of attack. Under most regulatory regimes, an aircraft's stall protection systems have to be tested and armed prior to takeoff, as well as remain armed throughout the flight; for this reason, startup checklists normally include performing such tests as a matter of routine. The vibration of the stick shaker is loud enough that it can be commonly heard on black box recordings of aircraft that have encountered stall conditions. This level of vigorous movement is intentional, the stick shaker having been designed to be impossible to ignore. To unfamiliar flight crews, the stall warning system can be viewed as aggressive and impatient, hence why it has become commonplace for the system to be introduced to trainee pilots via a flight simulator rather than a live aircraft. To fly without them would increase the likelihood of the aircraft encountering, and improperly responding to, a stall event. During the 2000s, there was a series of accidents that were attributed, at least in part, to their flight crews having made improper responses to the activation of the stall warning systems. During the early 2010s, in response to this wave of accidents, the FAA issued guidance urging operators to ensure that flight crews are properly training on the correct use of these aids.

It states that :\\\\prod_{n=1}^{\\\\infty}\\\\left(1-x^{n}\\\\right)=\\\\sum_{k=-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty}\\\\left(-1\\\\right)^{k}x^{k\\\\left(3k-1\\\\right)/2}=1+\\\\sum_{k=1}^\\\\infty(-1)^k\\\\left(x^{k(3k+1)/2}+x^{k(3k-1)/2}\\\\right). In other words, :(1-x)(1-x^2)(1-x^3) \\\\cdots = 1 - x - x^2 + x^5 + x^7 - x^{12} - x^{15} + x^{22} + x^{26} - \\\\cdots. The exponents 1, 2, 5, 7, 12, ... on the right hand side are given by the formula for k = 1, ‚àí1, 2, ‚àí2, 3, ... and are called (generalized) pentagonal numbers . This holds as an identity of convergent power series for x<1, and also as an identity of formal power series. A striking feature of this formula is the amount of cancellation in the expansion of the product.  Relation with partitions  The identity implies a marvelous recurrence for calculating p(n), the number of partitions of n: :p(n)=p(n-1)+p(n-2)-p(n-5)-p(n-7)+\\\\cdots or more formally, :p(n)=\\\\sum_{k eq 0} (-1)^{k-1}p(n-g_k) where the summation is over all nonzero integers k (positive and negative) and g_k is the kth generalized pentagonal number. Since p(n)=0 for all n<0, the series will eventually become zeroes, enabling discrete calculation. Bijective proof The theorem can be interpreted combinatorially in terms of partitions. In particular, the left hand side is a generating function for the number of partitions of n into an even number of distinct parts minus the number of partitions of n into an odd number of distinct parts. Each partition of n into an even number of distinct parts contributes +1 to the coefficient of xn; each partition into an odd number of distinct parts contributes ‚àí1\\\\. (The article on unrestricted partition functions discusses this type of generating function.) For example, the coefficient of x5 is +1 because there are two ways to split 5 into an even number of distinct parts (4+1 and 3+2), but only one way to do so for an odd number of distinct parts (the one-part partition 5). However, the coefficient of x12 is ‚àí1 because there are seven ways to partition 12 into an even number of distinct parts, but there are eight ways to partition 12 into an odd number of distinct parts. This interpretation leads to a proof of the identity via involution (i.e. a bijection which is its own inverse). Consider the Ferrers diagram of any partition of n into distinct parts. For example, the diagram below shows n = 20 and the partition 20 = 7 + 6 + 4 + 3. :******o *****o **** *** Let m be the number of elements in the smallest row of the diagram (m = 3 in the above example). Let s be the number of elements in the rightmost 45 degree line of the diagram (s = 2 dots in red above, since 7‚àí1 = 6, but 6‚àí1 > 4). If m > s, take the rightmost 45-degree line and move it to form a new row, as in the diagram below. :****** ***** **** *** oo If m ‚â§ s (as in our newly formed diagram where m = 2, s = 5) we may reverse the process by moving the bottom row to form a new 45 degree line (adding 1 element to each of the first m rows), taking us back to the first diagram. A bit of thought shows that this process always changes the parity of the number of rows, and applying the process twice brings us back to the original diagram. This enables us to pair off Ferrers diagrams contributing 1 and ‚àí1 to the xn term of the series, resulting in a net coefficient of 0. This holds for every term except when the process cannot be performed on every Ferrers diagram with n dots. There are two such cases: 1) m = s and the rightmost diagonal and bottom row meet. For example, :***** **** *** Attempting to perform the operation would lead us to: :****** ****which fails to change the parity of the number of rows, and is not reversible in the sense that performing the operation again does not take us back to the original diagram. If there are m elements in the last row of the original diagram, then :n=m+(m+1)+(m+2)+\\\\cdots+(2m-1)=\\\\frac {m(3m-1)}{2}=\\\\frac {k(3k-1)}{2} where the new index k is taken to equal m. Note that the sign associated with this partition is (‚àí1)s, which by construction equals (‚àí1)m and (‚àí1)k. 2) m = s+1 and the rightmost diagonal and bottom row meet. For example, :****** ***** **** Our operation requires us to move the right diagonal to the bottom row, but that would lead to two rows of three elements, forbidden since we're counting partitions into distinct parts. This is the previous case but with one fewer row, so :n=m+(m+1)+(m+2)+\\\\cdots+(2m-2)=\\\\frac{(m-1)(3m-2)}{2}=\\\\frac{k(3k-1)}{2}, where we take k = 1‚àím (a negative integer). Here the associated sign is (‚àí1)s with s = m‚àí1 = ‚àík, therefore the sign is again (‚àí1)k. In summary, it has been shown that partitions into an even number of distinct parts and an odd number of distinct parts exactly cancel each other, except if n is a generalized pentagonal number g_k = k(3k-1)/2, in which case there is exactly one Ferrers diagram left over. But this is precisely what the right side of the identity says should happen, so we are finished. Partition recurrence We can rephrase the above proof, using partitions, which we denote as: n = \\\\lambda_1 + \\\\lambda_2 + \\\\dotsb + \\\\lambda_\\\\ell, where \\\\lambda_1\\\\geq \\\\lambda_2\\\\geq\\\\ldots\\\\geq\\\\lambda_\\\\ell > 0. The number of partitions of n is the partition function p(n) having generating function: :\\\\sum_{n=0}^\\\\infty p(n) x^n = \\\\prod_{k=1}^\\\\infty (1 - x^k)^{-1} Note that is the reciprocal of the product on the left hand side of our identity: : \\\\left( \\\\sum_{n=0}^\\\\infty p(n) x^n \\\\right) \\\\cdot \\\\left(\\\\prod_{n=1}^\\\\infty (1-x^n)\\\\right) = 1 Let us denote the expansion of our product by \\\\prod_{n=1}^\\\\infty (1-x^n) = \\\\sum_{n=0}^\\\\infty a_nx^n, so that : \\\\left( \\\\sum_{n=0}^\\\\infty p(n) x^n \\\\right) \\\\cdot \\\\left(\\\\sum_{n=0}^\\\\infty a_nx^n\\\\right) = 1 . Multiplying out the left hand side and equating coefficients on the two sides, we obtain a0 p(0) = 1 and \\\\sum_{i=0}^n p(n{-}i) a_i = 0 for all n\\\\geq 1. This gives a recurrence relation defining p(n) in terms of an, and vice versa a recurrence for an in terms of p(n). Thus, our desired result: :a_i := \\\\begin{cases}1 & \\\\mbox{ if } i = \\\\frac{1}{2}(3k^2 \\\\pm k) \\\\mbox{ and } k \\\\mbox{ is even}\\\\\\\\\\\\ -1 & \\\\mbox{ if } i = \\\\frac{1}{2}(3k^2 \\\\pm k) \\\\mbox{ and } k \\\\mbox{ is odd }\\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & \\\\mbox{ otherwise }\\\\end{cases} for i\\\\geq 1 is equivalent to the identity \\\\sum_i (-1)^i p(n{-}g_i) = 0, where g_i := \\\\textstyle\\\\frac{1}{2}(3i^2-i) and i ranges over all integers such that g_i \\\\leq n (this range includes both positive and negative i, so as to use both kinds of generalized pentagonal numbers). This in turn means: :\\\\sum_{i \\\\mathrm{\\\\ even}} p(n{-}g_i) = \\\\sum_{i \\\\mathrm{\\\\ odd}} p(n{-}g_i),. In terms of sets of partitions, this is equivalent to saying that the following sets are of equal cardinality: :\\\\mathcal{X} := \\\\bigcup_{i \\\\mathrm{\\\\ even}} \\\\mathcal{P}(n-g_i) and \\\\mathcal{Y} := \\\\bigcup_{i \\\\mathrm{\\\\ odd}} \\\\mathcal{P}(n-g_i), where \\\\mathcal{P}(n) denotes the set of all partitions of n. All that remains is to give a bijection from one set to the other, which is accomplished by the function œÜ from X to Y which maps the partition \\\\mathcal{P}(n-g_i) i \\\\lambda : n-g_i = \\\\lambda_1 + \\\\lambda_2 + \\\\dotsb + \\\\lambda_\\\\ell to the partition \\\\lambda' = \\\\varphi(\\\\lambda) defined by: : \\\\varphi(\\\\lambda) := \\\\begin{cases} \\\\lambda' : n - g_{i-1} = (\\\\ell + 3i -2) + (\\\\lambda_1 - 1) + \\\\dotsb + (\\\\lambda_\\\\ell - 1) &\\\\mbox{ if } \\\\ell+3i > \\\\lambda_1\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\lambda' : n - g_{i+1} = (\\\\lambda_2 + 1) + \\\\dotsb + (\\\\lambda_\\\\ell + 1) + \\\\underbrace{1+\\\\dotsb+1}_{\\\\lambda_1 - \\\\ell - 3i} &\\\\mbox{ if } \\\\ell+3i \\\\leq \\\\lambda_1. \\\\end{cases} This is an involution (a self- inverse mapping), and thus in particular a bijection, which proves our claim and the identity.

It arise also by the action of ammonia on ethyl chloroformate.The Merck Index, 11th Edition, 9789 :558x558px Uses =Biomedical applications= Ethyl carbamate has been used as an antineoplastic agent and for other medicinal purposes, but this application ended after it was discovered to be carcinogenic in 1943. However, Japanese usage in medical injections continued and from 1950 to 1975 an estimated 100 million 2 ml ampules of 7-to-15% solutions of ethyl carbamate were injected into patients as a co-solvent in water for dissolving water-insoluble analgesics used for post-operation pain. These doses were estimated to be at levels that are carcinogenic in mice.Nomura Cancer Research, volume 35, pages 2895‚Äì2899, October 1975. This practice was stopped in 1975. \\"This regrettable medical situation appears to have involved the largest number (millions) of humans exposed to the largest doses of a pure carcinogen that is on record\\".Japanese Journal of Cancer Research, 82, 1323‚Äì1324, December 1991. The author, U.S. cancer researcher James A. Miller, called for studies to determine the effects on Japanese cancer rates to be performed but apparently none were ever done. Prior to World War II, ethyl carbamate saw relatively heavy use in the treatment of multiple myeloma before it was found to be toxic, carcinogenic, and largely ineffective. By US FDA regulations, ethyl carbamate has been withdrawn from pharmaceutical use. However, small quantities of ethyl carbamate are also used in laboratories as an anesthetic for animals.Virginia Commonwealth University, The Chemical/Biological Safety Section (CBSS) of the Office of Environmental Health and Safety, Working with Urethane, 2006. Accessed May 13, 2006 Ethyl carbamate was reclassified as a Group 2A carcinogen by IARC in 2007. Ethyl carbamate is frequently used as an anaesthetic in animal experiments, with more than 100 animal studies using ethyl carbamate published each year. One advantage of using ethyl carbamate is that it has a very long duration of action, with some adult rats remaining anaesthetised 24 hours after administration of the drug. It also does not depress neuronal activity in the cortex to the same extent as isoflurane. =Other uses= Formerly, crosslinking agents for permanent press textile treatments were synthesized from ethyl carbamate.NTP National Toxicology Program, NIEHS, National Institutes of Health, Eleventh Report on Carcinogens, Urethane, 2005. Accessed May 13, 2006 Occurrence in beverages and food The widespread presence of ethyl carbamate in alcoholic beverages was discovered during the mid-1980s. To raise public awareness of this issue, the U.S. Center for Science in the Public Interest published, in 1987, Tainted Booze: The Consumer's Guide to Urethane in Alcoholic Beverages. Studies have shown that most, if not all, yeast-fermented alcoholic beverages contain traces of ethyl carbamate (15 ppb to 12 ppm).Segal, M Too Many Drinks Spiked with Urethane , US Food and Drug Administration, September 1988 Other foods and beverages prepared by means of fermentation also contain ethyl carbamate. For example, bread has been found to contain 2 ppb; as much as 20 ppb has been found in some samples of soy sauce. Amounts of both ethyl carbamate and methyl carbamate have also been found in wines, sake, beer, brandy, whiskey and other fermented alcoholic beverages. It has been shown that ethyl carbamate forms from the reaction of ethanol with urea: :498x498px This reaction occurs much faster at higher temperatures, and therefore higher concentrations of ethyl carbamate are found in beverages that are heated during processing, such as brandy, whiskey, and other distilled beverages. Additionally, heating after bottling either during shipping or in preparation will cause ethyl carbamate levels to rise further. The urea in wines results from the metabolism of arginine or citrulline by yeast or other organisms. The urea waste product is initially metabolised inside the yeast cell until it builds up to a certain level. At that point, it is excreted externally where it is able to react with the alcohol to create ethyl carbamate. In 1988, wine and other alcoholic beverage manufacturers in the United States agreed to control the level of ethyl carbamate in wine to less than 15 ppb (parts per billion), and in stronger alcoholic drinks to less than 125 ppb. Although the urea cannot be eliminated, it can be minimized by controlling the fertilization of grape vines, minimizing their heat exposure, using self-cloning yeast and other actions.Butzke, C E & L F Bisson, Ethyl Carbamate Preventative Action Manual , Depart. of Viticulture & Enology, U. of CA, Davis, CA, for US FDA, 1997 accessed May 13, 2006 Furthermore, some strains of yeast have been developed to help reduce ethyl carbamate during commercial production of alcoholic beverages. Another important mechanism for ethyl carbamate formation in alcoholic beverages is the reaction from cyanide as precursor, which causes comparably high levels in spirits derived from cyanogenic plants, such as rhum agricole. Hazards Ethyl carbamate is not acutely toxic to humans, as reflected by its use as a medicine. Acute toxicity studies show that the lowest fatal dose in rats, mice, and rabbits equals 1.2 g/kg or more. When ethyl carbamate was used medicinally, about 50% of the patients exhibited nausea and vomiting, and long-time use led to gastroenteric hemorrhages.Office of Toxic Substances, Chemical Hazard Information Profile Urethane, CAS No. 51-79-6, U.S. EPA, Washington, D.C., 12 pages, 26 references, 1979, accessed May 13, 2006 at http://toxnet.nlm.nih.gov. The compound has almost no odor and a cooling, saline, bitter taste.National Library of Medicine, Hazardous Data Bank, Ethyl Carbamate 2006a, accessed May 13, 2006 at http://toxnet.nlm.nih.gov/. Studies with rats, mice, and hamsters have shown that ethyl carbamate causes cancer when administered orally, injected, or applied to the skin, but no adequate studies of cancer in humans caused by ethyl carbamate has been reported due to the ethical considerations of such studies.IARC, 1974 However, in 2007, the International Agency for Research on Cancer raised ethyl carbamate to a Group 2A carcinogen that is \\"probably carcinogenic to humans\\", one level below fully carcinogenic to humans. IARC has stated that ethyl carbamate can be \\"reasonably anticipated to be a human carcinogen based on sufficient evidence of carcinogenicity in experimental animals\\".NTP 2005 In 2006, the Liquor Control Board of Ontario in Canada rejected imported cases of sherry due to excessive levels of ethyl carbamate. Studies in Hong Kong (2009) and Korea (2015) outline the extent of the accumulative exposure to ethyl carbamate in daily life. Fermented foods such as soy sauce, kimchi, soybean paste, breads, rolls, buns, crackers and bean curd, along with wine, sake and plum wine, were found to be the foods with the highest ethyl carbamate levels in traditional Asian diets. In 2005, the JECFA (Joint FAO/WHO Expert Committee On Food Additives) risk-assessment evaluation of ethyl carbamate concluded that the MOE intake of ethyl carbamate from daily food and alcoholic beverages combined is of concern, and mitigation measures to reduce ethyl carbamate in some alcoholic beverages should continue. There is little doubt that ethyl carbamate in alcoholic beverages is very important to health authorities, while the cumulative daily exposure in the typical diet is also an issue of rising concern that merits closer observation. The Korean study concluded: \\"It would be desirable to closely monitor ethyl carbamate levels in Korean foods and find ways to reduce the daily intake.\\" The IARC evaluation has led to the following US regulatory actions: * NESHAP: Listed as a Hazardous Air Pollutant (HAP) * Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act: Reportable Quantity (RQ) = 100 lb * Emergency Planning and Community Right-To-Know Act, EPA's Toxics Release Inventory: A listed substance subject to RCRA reporting requirements * RCRA Listed Hazardous Waste: substance - U238 Detection in alcoholic beverages The concerns raised by the toxicological aspects of EC together with the low concentration levels (¬µg/L) found in wines, as well as the occurrence of interferences on detection, has motivated several researchers to develop new methods to determine it in wines. Several extraction and chromatographic techniques have been used, including continuous liquid‚Äìliquid extraction (LLE) with Soxhlet apparatus, derivatization with 9-xanthydrol followed by high- pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) with fluorescence detection and even LLE after derivatization, followed by gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry detection (GC‚ÄìMS). On the other hand, the reference method set by the International Organization of Vine and Wine (OIV) uses solid phase extraction (SPE) preceding GC‚ÄìMS quantification. Other methods also make use of SPE, but use gas chromatography with mass spectrometry (MDGC/MS) and liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry (LC‚ÄìMS/MS) for detection. Most of the methodologies found in the literature to quantify EC use gas chromatography, using LLE and SPE as extraction techniques. Nevertheless, several efforts have also been done to develop new methodologies to determine EC without using long procedures and hard-working analyses, combining precision to high sensitivity. In this regard, headspace solid phase microextraction (HS-SPME) has been gaining great highlighting and alternative methodologies has been proposed using the most recent identification and quantification technology, such as gas chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry detection (GC‚ÄìMS/MS) and two-dimensional gas chromatography with time-of-flight mass spectrometry (GC √ó GC‚ÄìToFMS). Microextraction by packed sorbent (MEPS) is also feasible. MEPS/GC‚ÄìMS methodology has been applied to quantify EC in wines. Miniaturized liquid-liquid extraction (mLLE) followed by LC-MS/MS can be used to determine EC in wine, without using derivatizing agents.

Slow flight can be as slow as 3-5 knots above stall airspeed. Slow flight is sometimes referred to as the ‚Äúregion of reversed command‚Äù or the ‚Äúback side of the power curve‚Äù. This is because in slow flight, more power is required to maintain straight and level flight at lower airspeeds. A very high angle of attack is required to maintain altitude in slow flight. At these low airspeeds, flight control surfaces begin to lose their effectiveness due to the reduction in airflow over them. Ailerons are the most affected, and roll control is significantly degraded. If ailerons are used in slow flight, there is a possibility that the high wing will stall due to the increased angle of attack, sending the aircraft into a spin. In many modern aircraft, flight envelope protection in the aircraft flight control system prevents this from happening. The rudder remains effective in slow flight, and yaw provided by it can be used to control the bank angle and direction of the aircraft.

While the term totem is derived from the North American Ojibwe language, belief in tutelary spirits and deities is not limited to indigenous peoples of the Americas but common to a number of cultures worldwide. Contemporary neoshamanic, New Age, and mythopoetic men's movements not otherwise involved in the practice of a tribal religion have been known to use \\"totem\\" terminology for the personal identification with a tutelary spirit or spirit guide. However, this can be seen as cultural misappropriation.Aldred, Lisa, \\"Plastic Shamans and Astroturf Sun Dances: New Age Commercialization of Native American Spirituality\\" in: The American Indian Quarterly 24.3 (2000) pp. 329‚Äì352. Lincoln: University of Nebraska Press. Anthropological perspectives A totem pole in Thunderbird Park, Victoria, British Columbia Totemism is a belief associated with animistic religions. The totem is usually an animal or other natural figure that spiritually represents a group of related people such as a clan. Early anthropologists and ethnologists like James George Frazer, Alfred Cort Haddon, John Ferguson McLennan and W. H. R. Rivers identified totemism as a shared practice across indigenous groups in unconnected parts of the world, typically reflecting a stage of human development. Tlingin totem pole in Juneau, Alaska. Scottish ethnologist John Ferguson McLennan, following the vogue of 19th-century research, addressed totemism in a broad perspective in his study The Worship of Animals and Plants (1869, 1870).MacLennan, J., The worship of animals and plants, Fortnightly Review, vol. 6-7 (1869-1870) McLennan did not seek to explain the specific origin of the totemistic phenomenon but sought to indicate that all of the human race had, in ancient times, gone through a totemistic stage. Another Scottish scholar, Andrew Lang, early in the 20th century, advocated a nominalistic explanation of totemism, namely, that local groups or clans, in selecting a totemistic name from the realm of nature, were reacting to a need to be differentiated.Andrew Lang A., Method in the Study of Totemism (1911) If the origin of the name was forgotten, Lang argued, there followed a mystical relationship between the object ‚Äî from which the name was once derived ‚Äî and the groups that bore these names. Through nature myths, animals and natural objects were considered as the relatives, patrons, or ancestors of the respective social units. British anthropologist Sir James George Frazer published Totemism and Exogamy in 1910, a four-volume work based largely on his research among Indigenous Australians and Melanesians, along with a compilation of the work of other writers in the field.Totemism and Exogamy. A Treatise on Certain Early Forms of Superstition and Society (1911-1915) By 1910, the idea of totemism as having common properties across cultures was being challenged, with Russian American ethnologist Alexander Goldenweiser subjecting totemistic phenomena to sharp criticism. Goldenweiser compared Indigenous Australians and First Nations in British Columbia to show that the supposedly shared qualities of totemism - exogamy, naming, descent from the totem, taboo, ceremony, reincarnation, guardian spirits and secret societies and art - were actually expressed very differently between Australia and British Columbia, and between different peoples in Australia and between different peoples in British Columbia. He then expands his analysis to other groups to show that they share some of the customs associated with totemism, without having totems. He concludes by offering two general definitions of totemism, one of which is: \\"Totemism is the tendency of definite social units to become associated with objects and symbols of emotional value\\".Goldenweiser A., Totemism; An analytical study, 1910 The founder of a French school of sociology, √âmile Durkheim, examined totemism from a sociological and theological point of view, attempting to discover a pure religion in very ancient forms and claimed to see the origin of religion in totemism.Durkheim E., Tot√©misme (1910) The leading representative of British social anthropology, A. R. Radcliffe-Brown, took a totally different view of totemism. Like Franz Boas, he was skeptical that totemism could be described in any unified way. In this he opposed the other pioneer of social anthropology in England, Bronis≈Çaw Malinowski, who wanted to confirm the unity of totemism in some way and approached the matter more from a biological and psychological point of view than from an ethnological one. According to Malinowski, totemism was not a cultural phenomenon, but rather the result of trying to satisfy basic human needs within the natural world. As far as Radcliffe-Brown was concerned, totemism was composed of elements that were taken from different areas and institutions, and what they have in common is a general tendency to characterize segments of the community through a connection with a portion of nature. In opposition to Durkheim's theory of sacralization, Radcliffe-Brown took the point of view that nature is introduced into the social order rather than secondary to it. At first, he shared with Malinowski the opinion that an animal becomes totemistic when it is ‚Äúgood to eat.‚Äù He later came to oppose the usefulness of this viewpoint, since many totems‚Äîsuch as crocodiles and flies‚Äîare dangerous and unpleasant.Radcliffe-Brown A., Structure and Function in Primitive Society, 1952 In 1938, the structural functionalist anthropologist A. P. Elkin wrote The Australian Aborigines: How to understand them. His typologies of totemism included eight \\"forms\\" and six \\"functions\\". The forms identified were: * individual (a personal totem), * sex (one totem for each gender), * moiety (the \\"tribe\\" consists of two groups, each with a totem), * section (the \\"tribe\\" consists of four groups, each with a totem), * subsection (the \\"tribe\\" consists of eight groups, each with a totem), * clan (a group with common descent share a totem or totems), * local (people living or born in a particular area share a totem) and * \\"multiple\\" (people across groups share a totem The functions identified were: * social (totems regulate marriage, and often a person cannot eat the flesh of their totem), * cult (totems associated with a secret organisation), * conception (multiple meanings), * dream (the person appears as this totem in others' dreams), * classificatory (the totem sorts people) and * assistant (the totem assists a healer or clever person). The terms in Elkin's typologies see some use today, but Aboriginal customs are seen as more diverse than his typologies suggest. As a chief representative of modern structuralism, French ethnologist Claude L√©vi-Strauss, and his, Le Tot√©misme aujourd'hui (\\"Totemism Today\\" [1958])(L√©vi-Strauss C., Le Tot√©misme aujourd'hui(1958); english trans. as Totemism, by Rodney Needham. Boston: Beacon Press, 1963 are often cited in the field. In the 21st century, Australian anthropologists question the extent to which \\"totemism\\" can be generalised even across different Aboriginal Australian peoples, let alone to other cultures like the Ojibwe from whom the term was originally derived. Rose, James and Watson write that: =Literature= Poets, and to a lesser extent fiction writers, often use anthropological concepts, including the anthropological understanding of totemism. For this reason, literary criticism often resorts to psychoanalytic, anthropological analyses.Maryniak, Irena. Spirit of the Totem: Religion and Myth in Soviet Fiction, 1964-1988, MHRA, 1995Berg, Henk de. Freud's Theory and Its Use in Literary and Cultural Studies: An Introduction. Camden House, 2004 Totem poles Personal totem of Mohegan Chief Tantaquidgeon, commemorated on a plaque at Norwich, Connecticut Totem poles of the Pacific Northwest of North America are monumental poles of heraldry. They feature many different designs (bears, birds, frogs, people, and various supernatural beings and aquatic creatures) that function as crests of families or chiefs. They recount stories owned by those families or chiefs or commemorate special occasions. These stories are known to be read from the bottom of the pole to the top. Aboriginal Australians and Torres Strait Islanders The spiritual, mutual relationships between Aboriginal Australians and Torres Strait Islanders and the natural world are often described as totems. Many Indigenous groups object to using the imported Ojibwe term \\"totem\\" to describe a pre-existing and independent practice, although others use the term. The term \\"token\\" has replaced \\"totem\\" in some areas. In some cases, such as the Yuin of coastal New South Wales, a person may have multiple totems of different types (personal, family or clan, gender, tribal and ceremonial). The lakinyeri or clans of the Ngarrindjeri were each associated with one or two plant or animal totems, called ngaitji. Totems are sometimes attached to moiety relations (such as in the case of Wangarr relationships for the Yolngu). Torres Strait Islanders have auguds, typically translated as totems. An augud could be a kai augud (\\"chief totem\\") or mugina augud (\\"little totem\\"). Early anthropologists sometimes attributed Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander totemism to ignorance about procreation, with the entrance of an ancestral spirit individual (the \\"totem\\") into the woman believed to be the cause of pregnancy (rather than insemination). James George Frazer in Totemism and Exogamy wrote that Aboriginal people \\"have no idea of procreation as being directly associated with sexual intercourse, and firmly believe that children can be born without this taking place\\". Frazer's thesis has been criticised by other anthropologists, including Alfred Radcliffe-Brown in Nature in 1938.

He is best remembered as one of the founders of the Social Democratic Workers' Party of Germany (SDAP) in 1869, which in 1875 merged with the General German Workers' Association into the Socialist Workers' Party of Germany (SAPD). During the repression under the terms of the Anti-Socialist Laws, Bebel became the leading figure of the social democratic movement in Germany and from 1892 until his death served as chairman of the Social Democratic Party of Germany. Biography =Early years= Ferdinand August Bebel, known to all by his middle name, was born on 22 February 1840, in Deutz, Germany, now a part of Cologne. He was the son of a Prussian noncommissioned officer in the Prussian infantry, initially from Ostrowo in the Province of Posen, and was born in military barracks. As a young man, Bebel apprenticed as a carpenter and joiner in Leipzig.\\"August Bebel, German Socialist Leader, Dies in Switzerland,\\" The Weekly People [New York], vol. 23, no. 21 (23 August 1913), pp. 1‚Äì2. Like most German workmen at that time, he traveled extensively in search of work and he thereby obtained a first-hand knowledge of the difficulties facing the working people of the day. At Salzburg, where he lived for some time, he joined a Roman Catholic workmen's club. When in Tyrol in 1859 he volunteered for service in the war against Italy, but was rejected; and in his own country he was rejected likewise as physically unfit for the army. In 1860 he settled in Leipzig as a master turner, making horn buttons. He joined various labor organizations. Although initially an opponent of socialism, Bebel gradually was won over to socialist ideas through pamphlets of Ferdinand Lassalle, which popularized the ideas of Karl Marx.Vladimir Lenin, \\"August Bebel,\\" Severnaia Pravada, 6 August 1913. Reprinted in Vladimir Lenin, Collected Works: Volume 19. Moscow: Progress Publishers, 1963; p. 297. In 1865 he came under the influence of Wilhelm Liebknecht and was thereafter committed fully to the socialist cause. In 1866 he joined the First International. =Political career= August Bebel c. 1910 Following the death of Lassalle, Bebel was among the group of Socialists that refused to follow new party leader Johann Baptist von Schweitzer at the Eisenach Conference of 1867, an action which gave rise to the name \\"Eisenachers\\" for this Marxist faction. Together with Liebknecht, he founded the S√§chsische Volkspartei (\\"Saxon People's Party\\"). Bebel was also President of the Union of German Workers' Associations from 1867 and a member of the First International.Andrei Pozdnyakov, \\"August Bebel,\\" Karl Marx, Frederick Engels Collected Works: Volume 44. New York: International Publishers, 1989; p. 684. Bebel was elected to the North German Reichstag as a member from Saxony in that same year. In 1869 he helped found the Social Democratic Workers' Party of Germany (SDAP), which later merged with another organization in 1875 to form the Socialist Workers' Party of Germany (SAPD), which in turn became the Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD) in 1890. Bebel's great organizing talent and oratorical power quickly made him one of the leaders of the socialists and their chief spokesman in parliament. He remained a member of the North German Parliament, and later of its counterpart for the German Empire, the Reichstag, until his death, except for the interval of 1881‚Äì83. He represented successively the districts of Glauchau-Meerane, Dresden, Strassburg, and Hamburg. Later in his life, he acted as chairman of the SPD. Representing as he did Marxian principles, he was bitterly opposed by certain factions of his party. In 1870 he spoke in parliament against the continuance of the war with France. Bebel and Liebknecht were the only members who did not vote the extraordinary subsidy required for the war with France. Bebel was one of only two socialists elected to the Reichstag in 1871, and he used his position to protest against the annexation of Alsace-Lorraine and to express his full sympathy with the Paris Commune. German Chancellor Otto von Bismarck afterwards said that this speech of Bebel's was a \\"ray of light\\" showing him that socialism was an enemy to be fought against and crushed. Falsely accused of being in league with the French and part of a conspiracy to free French prisoners of war held in Germany and to lead them in an attack from the rear, Bebel and Liebknecht were arrested for high treason, but no prosecution was possible for lack of evidence. Not wanting to release such important opponents of the war effort, old charges of preaching dangerous doctrines and plotting against the state were levied against Bebel and Liebknecht in 1872. The pair were convicted and sentenced to two years in ' (imprisonment in a fortress), which was spent at the famous K√∂nigstein Fortress. For insulting the German emperor, Bebel was additionally sentenced to nine months' ordinary imprisonment. This incarceration served to increase Bebel's prestige among his party associates and the sympathetic public at large. In 1874 Bebel took a partner and founded a small button factory, for which he acted as salesman, but in 1889 he gave up his business to devote himself wholly to politics. In 1868 he became connected with the staff of the Volksstaat (\\"The People's State\\") at Leipzig, and in 1891 with that of the Vorw√§rts (\\"Forward\\") at Berlin. After his release from prison, he helped to organize, at the congress of Gotha, the united party of Social Democrats, which had been formed during his imprisonment. After the passing of the Socialist Law he continued to show great activity in the debates of the Reichstag, and was also elected a member of the Saxon parliament; when the state of siege was proclaimed in Leipzig he was expelled from the city, and in 1886 condemned to nine months' imprisonment for taking part in a secret society. In party meetings of 1890 and 1891, Bebel's policies were severely attacked, first by the extremists, the \\"young\\" Socialists from Berlin, who wished to abandon parliamentary action; against these Bebel won a complete victory. On the other side he was involved in a quarrel with Volmar and his school, who desired to put aside from immediate consideration the complete attainment of the socialist ideal, and proposed that the party should aim at bringing about, not a complete overthrow of society, but a gradual amelioration. This conflict of tendencies continued, and Bebel came to be regarded as the chief exponent of the traditional views of the orthodox Marxist party. Though a strong opponent of militarism, he publicly stated that foreign nations attacking Germany must not expect the help or the neutrality of the Social Democrats. Already in 1911 amid the rising tensions between the European powers, Bebel publicly predicted an upcoming great war with millions of soldiers confronting each other followed by a great collapse, \\"mass bankruptcy, mass misery, mass unemployment and great famine.\\"Evans, Stephen (8 January 2014) Berlin 1914: A city of ambition and self-doubt, BBC News, Berlin In 1899, at the Hanover Congress of the SPD, Bebel delivered a speech condemning Eduard Bernstein's revisionism. His resolution, Attacks on the Fundamental Views and Tactics of the Party, garnered the support of the vast majority of the Congress, including Bernstein's supporters. =Class, race, religion and sex= Bebel particularly distinguished himself by his denunciation of the maltreatment of soldiers by officers and still more frequently by non-commissioned officers. His efforts in this matter had received great encouragement when King Albert of Saxony issued an edict dealing with the maltreatment of soldiers in the Saxon contingent, thus cutting the ground from under the feet of the Imperial Government, which had persistently attempted to deny or to explain away the cases put forward by Bebel. Speaking before the Reichstag, Bebel criticized the war to crush the Boxer Rebellion in China in 1900, saying: Bebel is also famed for his outrage at the news of German mistreatment of indigenous people in its South-West African colony, the Herero nation in particular. In 1904 following a revolt by the Herero people who were being pushed off their land to make way for German settlers, the government launched the Herero and Namaqua Genocide to crush the revolt by waging a \\"war of extermination\\" against the Herero. He and the German Social Democratic Party thus became the only party in the Reichstag to oppose increased colonial expenditures, and in a speech in March 1904 Bebel classified the policy in German West Africa as \\"not only barbaric, but bestial.\\" This caused some sections of the contemporary German press to scathingly classify Bebel as \\"Der hereroische Bebel\\" (Coburger Zeitung, 17 January 1904). Bebel was not deterred; he later followed this up with strongly worded warnings against the rising tide of theories of racial hierarchy and racial purity, causing the general election to the German Reichstag in 1907 to go over in history as the \\"Hottentot Election.\\"Smith, Helmut Walser; ‚ÄòThe Talk of Genocide‚Äô, the Rhetoric of Miscegenation: Notes on Debates in the German Reichstag Concerning Southwest Africa, 1904‚Äì1914, in The Imperialist Imagination: German Colonialism and its Legacy, (Sara Friedrichsmeyer etc. eds. 1998), p 107‚Äì23, 116, 111‚Äì12 & 118. Bebel's book, Women and Socialism was translated into English by Daniel De Leon of the Socialist Labor Party of America as Woman under Socialism.Bebel, August. Woman under Socialism, translation by Daniel DeLeon. New York: New York Labor News Company, 1904. It figured prominently in the Connolly-DeLeon controversy after James Connolly, then a member of the SLP, denounced it as a \\"quasi-prurient\\" book that would repel potential recruits to the socialist movement.James Connolly & Daniel DeLeon: The Connolly-DeLeon controversy. Cork Workers' Club, Cork 1976. The book contained an attack on the institution of marriage which identified Bebel with the most extreme forms of socialism. In the preface to DeLeon's translation, Woman Under Socialism, DeLeon distanced himself from Bebel on this point, holding that monogamy was the most desirable form of social organisation.DeLeon, Daniel (1904). \\"Translator's Preface\\" to Woman Under Socialism by August Bebel. New York Labor News Company, p. vi. In 1898 he voiced his support for the decriminalization of homosexuality in the Reichstag. Bebel held that religion is a \\"private matter\\", believing that the SPD should be neutral on the question of religion while advocating secularism. Bebel considered himself both a patriot and an internationalist believing them to not be antagonistic but instead supplemental. Bebel's tombstone at Sihlfeld cemetery, Zurich =Death and legacy= August Bebel died on 13 August 1913 of a heart attack during a visit to a sanatorium in Passugg, Switzerland. He was 73 years old at the time of his death. His body was buried in Z√ºrich. At the time of his death Bebel was eulogized by Russian Marxist leader Vladimir Lenin as a \\"model workers' leader,\\" who had proven himself able to \\"break his own road\\" from being an ordinary worker into becoming a political leader in the struggle for a \\"better social system.\\"Vladimir Lenin, \\"August Bebel,\\" Collected Works: Vol. 19, pp. 300‚Äì301. The well-known saying \\"Anti-Semitism is the socialism of fools\\" (\\"Der Antisemitismus ist der Sozialismus der dummen Kerle\\") is frequently attributed to Bebel, but probably originated with the Austrian democrat Ferdinand Kronawetter; it was in general use among German Social Democrats by the 1890s.Richard J. Evans, The Coming of the Third Reich (Penguin Group, 2005: ), p. 496. Along with Karl Marx, Friedrich Engels and Ferdinand Lassalle, Bebel was among the socialist icons included in bas relief portraits on the facade of The Forward building, erected in 1912 as the headquarters of the New York Yiddish-language socialist newspaper.

The Calvert family, who founded Maryland partly as a refuge for English Catholics, sought enactment of the law to protect Catholic settlers and those of other religions that did not conform to the dominant Anglicanism of Britain and her colonies. The Act was revoked in 1654, before being reinstated again, and finally, repealed permanently in 1692 following the Glorious Revolution.

Historians of art and photography also consider him a Surrealist photographer. Biography Bellmer was born in the city of Kattowitz, then part of the German Empire (now Katowice, Poland). Up until 1926, he worked as a draftsman for his own advertising company. Bellmer and Zurn's gravestone at the P√®re- Lachaise cemetery. Bellmer is most famous for the creation of a series of dolls as well as photographs of them. He was influenced in his choice of art form in part by reading the published letters of Oskar Kokoschka (Der Fetisch, 1925). Bellmer's doll project is also said to have been catalysed by a series of events in his personal life. Hans Bellmer takes credit for provoking a physical crisis in his father and brings his own artistic creativity into association with childhood insubordination and resentment toward a severe and humorless paternal authority. Perhaps this is one reason for the nearly universal, unquestioning acceptance in the literature of Bellmer's promotion of his art as a struggle against his father, the police, and ultimately, fascism and the state. Events of his personal life also including meeting a beautiful teenage cousin in 1932 (and perhaps other unattainable beauties), attending a performance of Jacques Offenbach's Tales of Hoffmann (in which a man falls tragically in love with an automaton), and receiving a box of his old toys.Webb, Peter, and Robert Short. Death, Desire and the Doll: The Life and Art of Hans Bellmer. Gardena: Solar Books, 2006, 19‚Äì21. After these events, he began to actually construct his first dolls. In his works, Bellmer explicitly sexualized the doll as a young girl. The dolls incorporated the principle of \\"ball joint\\", which was inspired by a pair of sixteenth-century articulated wooden dolls in the Kaiser Friedrich Museum Jonathan Hirschfeld has claimed (without further argumentation) that Bellmer initiated his doll project to oppose the fascism of the Nazi Party by declaring that he would make no work that would support the new German state. Represented by mutated forms and unconventional poses, his dolls (according to this view) were directed specifically at the cult of the perfect body then prominent in Germany.[https://www.haaretz.com/1.5087189 It's a Doll's Life, Jonathan Hirschfeld, Haaretz Sketch for the Die Puppe series, 1932 He visited Paris in 1935 and made contacts there, such as Paul √âluard, but returned to Berlin because his wife Margarete was dying of tuberculosis.Webb and Short, 20, 31. Bellmer produced the first doll in Berlin in 1933. Long since lost, the assemblage can nevertheless be correctly described thanks to approximately two dozen photographs Bellmer took at the time of its construction. Standing about fifty-six inches tall, the doll consisted of a modeled torso made of flax fiber, glue, and plaster; a mask-like head of the same material with glass eyes and a long, unkempt wig; and a pair of legs made from broomsticks or dowel rods. One of these legs terminated in a wooden, club-like foot; the other was encased in a more naturalistic plaster shell, jointed at the knee and ankle. As the project progressed, Bellmer made a second set of hollow plaster legs, with wooden ball joints for the doll's hips and knees. There were no arms to the first sculpture, but Bellmer did fashion or find a single wooden hand, which appears among the assortment of doll parts the artist documented in an untitled photograph of 1934, as well as in several photographs of later work. Bellmer's 1934 anonymous book, The Doll (Die Puppe), produced and published privately in Germany, contains 10 black-and- white photographs of Bellmer's first doll arranged in a series of \\"tableaux vivants\\" (living pictures). The book was not credited to him, as he worked in isolation, and his photographs remained almost unknown in Germany. Yet Bellmer's work was eventually declared \\"degenerate\\" by the Nazi Party, and he was forced to flee Germany to France in 1938, where Bellmer's work was welcomed by the Surrealists around Andr√© Breton.Webb and Short, 30. He aided the French Resistance during the war by making fake passports. He was imprisoned in the Camp des Milles prison at Aix-en-Provence, a brickworks camp for German nationals, from September 1939 until the end of the Phoney War in May 1940.Webb and Short, 81. After the war, Bellmer lived the rest of his life in Paris. Bellmer gave up doll-making and spent the following decades creating erotic drawings, etchings, sexually explicit photographs, paintings, and prints of pubescent girls. In 1954, he met Unica Z√ºrn, who became his companion until her suicide in 1970.Webb and Short, 148, 180 He continued working into the 1960s. Of his own work, Bellmer said, \\"What is at stake here is a totally new unity of form, meaning and feeling: language-images that cannot simply be thought up or written up ‚Ä¶ They constitute new, multifaceted objects, resembling polyplanes made of mirrors ‚Ä¶ As if the illogical was relaxation, as if laughter was permitted while thinking, as if error was a way and chance, a proof of eternity.‚Äù Bellmer died 24 February 1975 of bladder cancer.Webb and Short, 187. He was buried beside Z√ºrn at P√®re Lachaise Cemetery with a tomb marked \\"Bellmer ‚Äì Z√ºrn\\".Webb and Short, 187. In popular culture The New York-based post-punk band Bellmer Dolls took their name from the dolls of Hans Bellmer. The 2003 film Love Object contains clear references to Bellmer's work, including the protagonist's obsessive relationship with a sex doll and the use of Bellmer's name as a leading character, Lisa Bellmer. Ghost in the Shell 2: Innocence, a 2004 anime film, features elements of Bellmer's erotic and uncanny dolls.Brown, Steven T. 2010. \\"Machinic Desires: Hans Bellmer's Dolls and the Technological Uncanny in Ghost in the Shell 2: Innocence\\". Mechademia. 3, no. 1: 222‚Äì253. Additionally, director Mamoru Oshii has referred to Bellmer's dolls as an inspiration for the film. A creature from the 2001 video game Silent Hill 2 named Mannequin bears a strong resemblance to Bellmer's dolls. However, Masahiro Ito, the monster designer of the game, commented on this saying that they had no influence on his design of the Mannequin; instead his inspiration came from traditional Japanese folklore. The New York-based avant-garde band Naked City used images of Bellmer's dolls for the front cover and liner notes of their final album, Absinthe.

MacArthur Foundation is a private foundation that makes grants and impact investments to support non-profit organizations in approximately 50 countries around the world. It has an endowment of $7.0 billion and provides approximately $260 million annually in grants and impact investments. It is based in Chicago and is the 12th-largest private foundation in the United States. It has awarded more than US$6.8 billion since its first grants in 1978. The Foundation's stated aim is to support \\"creative people, effective institutions, and influential networks building a more just, verdant, and peaceful world.\\" MacArthur's current grant-making priorities include mitigating climate change, reducing jail populations, decreasing nuclear threats, supporting nonprofit journalism, and funding local priorities in its hometown of Chicago. The MacArthur Fellows Program, also referred to as \\"genius grants\\" or \\"genius award\\", awards $625,000 no-strings-attached grants annually to about two dozen creative individuals in diverse fields \\"who have shown extraordinary originality and dedication in their creative pursuits.\\" The Foundation's 100&Change; competition awards a $100 million grant every three years to a single proposal. History John D. MacArthur owned Bankers Life and Casualty and other businesses, as well as considerable property holdings in Florida and New York. His wife, Catherine, held positions in many of these companies. Their attorney, William T. Kirby, and Paul Doolen, their chief financial officer, suggested that the family create a foundation to be endowed by their vast fortune. One of the reasons MacArthur originally set up the Foundation was to avoid taxes. When MacArthur died on January 6, 1978, he was worth in excess of a billion dollars. He left 92 percent of his estate to found the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation. The composition of the Foundation's first board of directors, per MacArthur's will, also included J. Roderick MacArthur, John's son from his first marriage, two other officers of Bankers Life and Casualty, and radio commentator Paul Harvey. Jonas Salk, the inventor of the polio vaccine, later joined the Foundation's board of directors. The elder MacArthur believed in the free market. However, he did not spell out specific parameters for how his money was to be spent after he died. MacArthur told the Foundation's board of directors, \\"I figured out how to make the money. You fellows will have to figure out how to spend it.\\" Between 1979 and 1981, John's son J. Roderick MacArthur, an ideological opponent of his father with whom the elder MacArthur had an acrimonious relationship, waged a legal battle against the Foundation for control of the board of directors. The younger MacArthur sued eight members of the board, accusing them of mismanagement of the Foundation's finances. By 1981, most of the original board had been replaced by members who agreed with J. Roderick MacArthur's desire to support liberal causes. This ultimately resulted in the creation of what, in 2008, historian and conservative commentator Martin Morse Wooster called \\"one of the pillars of the liberal philanthropic establishment.\\" In 1984, MacArthur again sued the board of directors, asking a Cook County circuit court to liquidate the entire MacArthur Foundation. He dropped the suit later that same year when he was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer. Leadership John E. Corbally, the first president of the Foundation and later board chairman from 1995 to 2002, was followed in 1989‚Äì99 by Adele Simmons, who was the first female dean at Princeton University. Jonathan Fanton, president of American Academy of Arts and Sciences, served as the Foundation's next president. Robert Gallucci, formerly dean of Georgetown University's School of Foreign Service, served as the Foundation's fourth president from 2009 to 2014. Gallucci was fired in 2014. Julia Stasch, who formerly served as MacArthur's vice president for U.S. Programs, was named the Foundation's president in 2015. Stasch had formerly served as chief of staff to Chicago mayor Richard M. Daley. She announced that she would step down in 2019. In March 2019, John Palfrey was named the next president of the foundation, effective September 1, 2019. MacArthur Fellowship The MacArthur Fellowship is an award issued by the MacArthur Foundation each year, to typically 20 to 30 citizens or residents of the United States, of any age and working in any field, who \\"show exceptional merit and promise for continued and enhanced creative work.\\" The program was initiated in 1981. According to the Foundation, the fellowship is not a reward for past accomplishment, but an investment in a person's originality and potential. MacArthur Fellows receive $625,000 each, which is paid out in quarterly installments over five years. The Chicago Foundation for Women was one of the nonprofit organizations to receive a US$1million four-year grant in 2017. No one can apply for the program, and, generally, no one knows if he or she is being considered as a candidate. Nominators, serving confidentially, anonymously and for a limited time, are invited to recommend potential Fellows. Candidates are reviewed by a selection committee whose members also serve confidentially, anonymously and for a limited time. Ultimately, the selection committee makes recommendations to the Foundation's board of directors for final approval. 100&Change; In June 2016, the foundation requested \\"proposals promising real progress toward solving a critical problem of our time in any field or any location.\\" The winning proposal would receive a $100 million grant. Almost 2,000 proposals were submitted. In December 2017, the foundation announced that the winning proposal was submitted by the Sesame Workshop and the International Rescue Committee. The grant was put toward educating Middle Eastern refugee children.

Biography Born in Leipzig in 1870 as the son of Wilhelm Liebknecht and the brother of Karl Liebknecht, Theodor Liebknecht studied law and worked, together with his brother Karl and Oskar Cohn, as a lawyer in Berlin from 1899 on, becoming politically active after his brother's murder in January 1919. Liebknecht was a member of the Independent Social Democratic Party of Germany (USPD), opposed to the merger with the KPD and the joining of the Comintern but also to the reunification of the party with the SPD, he continued the USPD as an independent party with Georg Ledebour until its merger into the Sozialistische Arbeiterpartei Deutschlands (SAPD, \\"Socialist Worker's Party of Germany\\") in 1931. In 1922 he accompanied Kurt Rosenfeld, Emile Vandervelde and Arthur Wauter as foreign socialist lawyers who participated in the defence of the Socialist Revolutionaries in the 1922 Moscow Trial of Socialist Revolutionaries. In 1924, he was involved in the split of the Sozialistischer Bund together with Georg Ledebour. A right-wing member of the SAPD, he was opposed to the introduction of Leninist schemes of organization into the party. Following the Nazi rise to power, he emigrated to Basel, Switzerland in 1933 and was later employed by the International Institute of Social History in Amsterdam from 1936 to 1939.

Each JƒÅti typically has an association with a traditional job function or tribe. Religious beliefs (e.g. Sri Vaishnavism or Smarthism or Veer Shaivism) or linguistic groupings may define some JƒÅtis. A person's surname typically reflects a community (JƒÅti) association: thus Gandhi = perfume seller, Dhobi = washerman, Srivastava = military scribe, etc.  Meaning  Professor Madhav Gadgil (1983) has described JƒÅtis as self-governing, closed communities, based on his research in rural Maharashtra: Under the JƒÅti system, a person is born into a JƒÅti with ascribed social roles and endogamy, i.e. marriages take place only within that JƒÅti. The JƒÅti provides identity, security and status and has historically been open to change based on economic, social and political influences. In the course of Indian history, various economic, political and social factors have led to a continuous closing and churning in the prevailing social ranks which tended to become traditional, hereditary system of social structuring. This system of thousands of exclusive, endogamous groups, is called JƒÅti. Though there were several variations across the breadth of India, the JƒÅti was the effective community within which one married and spent most of one's personal life. Often it was the community (JƒÅti) which provided support in difficult times, in old age and even in the resolution of disputes. It was thus the community which one also sought to promote.  Overlap with varnas  From 1901 onwards, for the purposes of the Decennial Census, the British classified all JƒÅtis into one or the other of the varna social-status related categories as described in Brahminical literature. Herbert Hope Risley, the Census Commissioner, noted that \\"The principle suggested as a basis was that of classification by social precedence as recognized by native public opinion at the present day, and manifesting itself in the facts that particular castes are supposed to be the modern representatives of one or other of the castes of the theoretical Indian system.\\"Crooke, William. \\"Social Types\\". Chapter II in Risley, Sir Herbert Hope. The People of India. This deliberately ignored the fact that there are innumerable JƒÅtis that straddled two or more Varnas, based on their occupations. As a community in south India commented, \\"We are soldiers and saddle makers too\\" - but it was the enumerators who decided their caste. Since pre-historic times, Indian society had a complex, inter-dependent, and cooperative political economy. One well known text, the Laws of Manu, c. 200, codified the social relations between communities from the perspective of the Varna castes. Although this book was almost unknown during the Islamic period, it gained prominence when the British administrators and Western scholars used it to gain an understanding of traditional Hindu law in India and translated it into English.Dirks, Nicholas B. Castes of Mind. Princeton Crispin Bates noted in 1995 that  Self-identity narratives  All JƒÅtis across the spectrum, from the so-called upper castes to the lowest of castes, including the so-called Untouchables, a group nomenclature after the next (1911) census, tended to avoid intermarriage, sharing of food and drinks, or even close social interaction with a JƒÅti other than their own. The JƒÅtis did not see themselves as socially inferior to the others. If at all, it was the other way round and many had folk narratives, traditions, myths and legends to bolster their sense of identity and cultural uniqueness. For instance, the Yadavs, a prominent backward class believe that \\"Even in the Vedic age the Yadavs were upholders of the Republican ideals of government.... The Mahabharata furnishes interesting details regarding the functioning of the republic form of government among the Yadavs.... It is now an agreed fact that Sri Krishna, the central figure of the epic narratives tried to defend the republican ideas against the imperialistic movement led by Jarasandha of Magadaha and Kamsa of Mathura\\" (R. V. K. Yadav quoted by Lucia Michelutti in \\"Caste and modern politics in a north Indian town\\"). Dalits also have \\"the stories that assert the glory of the caste, identify legendary figures who, the narrators imagine, have played pivotal roles in building their caste identity. The facts of the past are interspersed with myth and fantasy to create a new perception of a past that is glorious, pure and exclusive. This in turn is accorded historical status and imagined to have existed from time immemorial (Seneviratne1997: 5). This kind of history, which seeks authenticity from written sources and from the self-interpretation of so-called archaeological remains, is sustained by commemorations such as feasts, fasts, celebrations and the creation of new symbols like flags and emblems based on these...\\" See also * Indian caste system * Gens * Gotra References Category:Indian castes Category:Indian caste system de:Kaste#Jati ","title":"JƒÅti"},{"id":"340330","text":"The Watts riots, sometimes referred to as the Watts Rebellion or Watts Uprising, took place in the Watts neighborhood and its surrounding areas of Los Angeles from August 11 to 16, 1965. On August 11, 1965, Marquette Frye, an African-American motorist on parole for shoplifting, was pulled over for reckless driving.Dawsey, Darrell (August 19, 1990). \\"To CHP Officer Who Sparked Riots, It Was Just Another Arrest\\". Los Angeles Times. A minor roadside argument broke out, which then escalated into a fight with police. Community members spread a rumor that the police had hurt a pregnant woman, and six days of civil unrest followed. Nearly 14,000 members of the California Army National Guard helped suppress the disturbance, which resulted in 34 deaths and over $40 million in property damage. It was the city's worst unrest until the Rodney King riots of 1992. Background In the Great Migration of 1915‚Äì1940, major populations of African Americans moved to Northeastern and Midwestern cities such as Detroit, Chicago, St. Louis, Cincinnati, Philadelphia, Boston, and New York City to pursue jobs in newly established manufacturing industries; to cement better educational and social opportunities; and to flee racial segregation, Jim Crow laws, violence and racial bigotry in the Southern states. This wave of migration largely bypassed Los Angeles. In the 1940s, in the Second Great Migration, black workers and families migrated to the West Coast in large numbers, in response to defense industry recruitment efforts at the start of World War II. President Franklin D. Roosevelt issued Executive Order 8802 directing defense contractors not to discriminate in hiring or promotions, opening up new opportunities for minorities. The black population in Los Angeles dramatically rose from approximately 63,700 in 1940 to about 350,000 in 1965, rising from 4% of L.A.'s population to 14%.\\"The Great Migration: Creating a New Black Identity in Los Angeles\\", KCET\\"Population\\", LA Almanac =Residential segregation= Los Angeles had racially restrictive covenants that prevented specific minorities from renting and buying property in certain areas, even long after the courts ruled such practices illegal in 1948 and the Civil Rights Act of 1964 was passed. At the beginning of the 20th century, Los Angeles was geographically divided by ethnicity, as demographics were being altered by the rapid migration from the Philippines (then-U.S. unincorporated territory at the time) and immigration from Mexico, Japan, Korea, and Southern and Eastern Europe. In the 1910s, the city was already 80% covered by racially restrictive covenants in real estate. By the 1940s, 95% of Los Angeles and southern California housing was off-limits to certain minorities. Minorities who had served in World War II or worked in L.A.'s defense industries returned to face increasing patterns of discrimination in housing. In addition, they found themselves excluded from the suburbs and restricted to housing in East or South Los Angeles, which includes the Watts neighborhood and Compton. Such real-estate practices severely restricted educational and economic opportunities available to the minority community. Following the US entry into World War II after the attack on Pearl Harbor, the federal government removed and interned 70,000 Japanese-Americans from Los Angeles, leaving empty spaces in predominantly Japanese-owned areas. This further bolstered the migration of black residents into the city during the Second Great Migration to occupy the vacated spaces, such as Little Tokyo. As a result, housing in South Los Angeles became increasingly scarce, overwhelming the already established communities and providing opportunities for real estate developers. Davenport Builders, for example, was a large developer who responded to the demand, with an eye on undeveloped land in Compton. What was originally a mostly white neighborhood in the 1940s increasingly became an African-American, middle- class dream in which blue-collar laborers could enjoy suburbia away from the slums. In the post-World War II era, suburbs in the Los Angeles area grew explosively as black residents also wanted to live in peaceful white neighborhoods. In a thinly-veiled attempt to sustain their way of life and maintain the general peace and prosperity, most of these suburbs barred black people, using a variety of methods. White middle-class people in neighborhoods bordering black districts moved en masse to the suburbs, where newer housing was available. The spread of African Americans throughout urban Los Angeles was achieved in large part through blockbusting, a technique whereby real estate speculators would buy a home on an all-white street, sell or rent it to a black family, and then buy up the remaining homes from Caucasians at cut- rate prices, then sell them to housing-hungry black families at hefty profits. The Rumford Fair Housing Act, designed to remedy residential segregation, was overturned by Proposition 14, which was sponsored by the California real estate industry, and supported by a majority of white voters. Psychiatrist and civil rights activist Alvin Poussaint considered Proposition 14 to be one of the root causes of black rebellion in Watts.Theoharis, Jeanne (2006). The Black Power Movement: Rethinking the Civil Rights-Black Power Era. (New York: Routledge), p. 47-49. Archived at Google Books. Retrieved February 4, 2016. In 1950, William H. Parker was appointed and sworn in as Los Angeles Chief of Police. After a major scandal called Bloody Christmas of 1951, Parker pushed for more independence from political pressures that would enable him to create a more professionalized police force. The public supported him and voted for charter changes that isolated the police department from the rest of the city government. In the 1960s, the LAPD was promoted as one of the best police forces in the world . Despite its reform and having a professionalized, military-like police force, William Parker's LAPD faced repeated criticism from the city's Latino and black residents for police brutality‚Äîresulting from his recruiting of officers from the South with strong anti-black and anti- Latino attitudes. Chief Parker coined the term \\"Thin Blue Line\\", representing the police as holding down pervasive crime. Resentment of such longstanding racial injustices are cited as reasons why Watts' African-American population exploded on August 11, 1965, in what would become the Watts Riots.Watts Riots (August 1965)  The Black Past: Remembered and Reclaimed. The Black Past (August 11, 1965). Inciting incident On the evening of Wednesday, August 11, 1965, 21-year-old Marquette Frye, an African-American man driving his mother's 1955 Buick while drunk, was pulled over by California Highway Patrol motorcycle officer Lee Minikus for alleged reckless driving.Dawsey, Darrell (August 19, 1990). \\"To CHP Officer Who Sparked Riots, It Was Just Another Arrest\\". Los Angeles Times. After administering a field sobriety test, Minikus placed Frye under arrest and radioed for his vehicle to be impounded.Cohen, Jerry; Murphy, William S. (July 15, 1966). \\"Burn, Baby, Burn!\\" Life. Archived at Google Books. Retrieved February 4, 2016. Marquette's brother, Ronald, a passenger in the vehicle, walked to their house nearby, bringing their mother, Rena Price, back with him to the scene of the arrest. When Rena Price reached the intersection of Avalon Boulevard and 116th Street that evening, she scolded Frye about drinking and driving as he recalled in a 1985 interview with the Orlando Sentinel. However, the situation quickly escalated: Someone shoved Price, Frye was struck, Price jumped an officer, and another officer pulled out a shotgun. Backup police officers attempted to arrest Frye by using physical force to subdue him. After community members reported that police had roughed up Frye and spread an unsubstantiated rumor they had kicked a pregnant woman, angry mobs formed. As the situation intensified, growing crowds of local residents watching the exchange began yelling and throwing objects at the police officers.Abu-Lughod, Janet L. Race, Space, and Riots in Chicago, New York, and Los Angeles. New York: Oxford University Press, 2007. Frye's mother and brother fought with the officers and eventually were arrested along with Marquette Frye. After the arrests of Price and her sons the Frye brothers, the crowd continued to grow along Avalon Boulevard. Police came to the scene to break up the crowd several times that night, but were attacked when people threw rocks and chunks of concrete. A 46-square-mile (119 square kilometer) swath of Los Angeles was transformed into a combat zone during the ensuing six days. Riot begins Police arrest a man during the riots on August 12 40th Armored Division direct traffic away from an area of South Central Los Angeles burning during the Watts riot After a night of increasing unrest, police and local black community leaders held a community meeting on Thursday, August 12, to discuss an action plan and to urge calm. The meeting failed. Later that day, Chief Parker called for the assistance of the California Army National Guard. Chief Parker believed the riots resembled an insurgency, compared it to fighting the Viet Cong, and decreed a \\"paramilitary\\" response to the disorder. Governor Pat Brown declared that law enforcement was confronting \\"guerrillas fighting with gangsters\\". The rioting intensified, and on Friday, August 13, about 2,300 National Guardsmen joined the police in trying to maintain order on the streets. Sergeant Ben Dunn said: \\"The streets of Watts resembled an all-out war zone in some far-off foreign country, it bore no resemblance to the United States of America.\\" The first riot-related death occurred on the night of August 13, when a black civilian was killed in the crossfire during a shootout between the police and rioters. Over the next few days, rioting had then spread throughout other areas, including Pasadena, Pacoima, Monrovia, Long Beach, and even as far as San Diego, although they were very minor in comparison to Watts. About 200 Guardsmen and the LAPD were sent to assist the Long Beach Police Department (LBPD) in controlling the unruly crowd. By nightfall on Saturday, 16,000 law enforcement personnel had been mobilized and patrolled the city. Blockades were established, and warning signs were posted throughout the riot zones threatening the use of deadly force (one sign warned residents to \\"Turn left or get shot\\"). Angered over the police response, residents of Watts engaged in a full-scale battle against the first responders. Rioters tore up sidewalks and bricks to hurl at Guardsmen and police, and to smash their vehicles. Those actively participating in the riots started physical fights with police, blocked Los Angeles Fire Department (LAFD) firefighters from using fire hoses on protesters and burning buildings, or stopped and beat white motorists while yelling racial slurs in the area. Arson and looting were largely confined to local white-owned stores and businesses that were said to have caused resentment in the neighborhood due to low wages and high prices for local workers. To quell the riots, Chief Parker initiated a policy of mass arrest. Following the deployment of National Guardsmen, a curfew was declared for a vast region of South Central Los Angeles. In addition to the Guardsmen, 934 LAPD officers and 718 officers from the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department (LASD) were deployed during the rioting. Watts and all black- majority areas in Los Angeles were put under the curfew. All residents outside of their homes in the affected areas after 8:00 pm were subject to arrest. Eventually, nearly 3,500 people were arrested, primarily for curfew violations. By the morning of Sunday, August 15, the riots had largely been quelled. Over the course of six days, between 31,000 and 35,000 adults participated in the riots. Around 70,000 people were \\"sympathetic, but not active.\\" Over the six days, there were 34 deaths,\\"The Watts Riots of 1965, in a Los Angeles newspaper... \\".

Many white Americans were fearful of the breakdown of social order in Watts, especially since white motorists were being pulled over by rioters in nearby areas and assaulted.Queally, James (July 29, 2015). \\"Watts Riots: Traffic stop was the spark that ignited days of destruction in L.A.\\", Los Angeles Times. Many in the black community, however, believed the rioters were taking part in an \\"uprising against an oppressive system.\\" In a 1966 essay, black civil rights activist Bayard Rustin wrote: > The whole point of the outbreak in Watts was that it marked the first major > rebellion of Negroes against their own masochism and was carried on with the > express purpose of asserting that they would no longer quietly submit to the > deprivation of slum life. Despite allegations that \\"criminal elements\\" were responsible for the riots, the vast majority of those arrested had no prior criminal record. Only three sworn personnel were killed in the riots: an LAFD firefighter was struck when a wall of a fire-weakened structure fell on him while fighting fires in a store, an LASD deputy was shot when another deputy's shotgun was discharged in a struggle with rioters, and an LBPD officer was shot by another police officer's gun that was discharged during a scuffle with rioters. 23 out of the 34 people killed in the riots were shot by LAPD officers (16 deaths) or National Guardsmen (seven deaths). According to The Encyclopedia of African American History, \\"What is often called a riot could also be called \\"social protest, revolt, or rebellion\\", \\"as a revolt against deeply encrusted forms of bias\\". After the riots Debate rose quickly over what had taken place in Watts, as the area was known to be under a great deal of racial and social tension. Reactions and reasoning about the riots greatly varied based on the perspectives of those affected by and participating in the riots' chaos. National civil rights leader Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. spoke two days after the riots happened in Watts. The riots were partly a response to Proposition 14, a constitutional amendment sponsored by the California Real Estate Association and passed that had in effect repealed the Rumford Fair Housing Act.Tracy Domingo, Miracle at Malibu Materialized, Graphic, November 14, 2002 In 1966, the California Supreme Court reinstated the Rumford Fair Housing Act in the Reitman v. Mulkey case (a decision affirmed by the U.S. Supreme Court the following year), declaring the amendment to violate the US constitution and laws. A variety of opinions and explanations were published. Public opinion polls studied in the few years after the riot showed that a majority believed the riots were linked to communist groups who were active in the area protesting high unemployment rates and racial discrimination.Jeffries, Vincent & Ransford, H. Edward. \\"Interracial Social Contact and Middle-Class White Reaction to the Watts Riot\\". Social Problems 16.3 (1969): 312‚Äì324. Those opinions concerning racism and discrimination were expressed three years after hearings conducted by a committee of the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights took place in Los Angeles to assess the condition of relations between the police force and minorities. These hearings were also intended to make a ruling on the discrimination case against the police for their alleged mistreatment of members of the Nation of Islam. These different arguments and opinions are often cited in continuing debates over the underlying causes of the Watts riots. = White flight = After the Watts Riots, white families left surrounding nearby suburbs like Compton, Huntington Park, and South Gate in large numbers, leading to significant demographic and economic changes of these suburbs. Although the unrest did not reach these suburbs during the riots, many white residents in Huntington Park, for instance, left the area. = McCone Commission = A commission under Governor Pat Brown investigated the riots, known as the McCone Commission, and headed by former CIA director John A. McCone. It released a 101-page report on December 2, 1965 entitled Violence in the City‚ÄîAn End or a Beginning?: A Report by the Governor's Commission on the Los Angeles Riots, 1965.Violence in the City‚ÄîAn End or a Beginning?: A Report by the Governor's Commission on the Los Angeles Riots, 1965. University of Southern California. Retrieved August 21, 2014. The McCone Commission identified the root causes of the riots to be high unemployment, poor schools, and related inferior living conditions that were endured by African Americans in Watts. Recommendations for addressing these problems included \\"emergency literacy and preschool programs, improved police-community ties, increased low-income housing, more job-training projects, upgraded health-care services, more efficient public transportation, and many more.\\" Most of these recommendations were never implemented. = Aftermath = Marquette Frye died of pneumonia on December 20, 1986, at age 42. His mother, Rena Price, died on June 10, 2013, at age 97. She never recovered the impounded 1955 Buick which her son had been driving because the storage fees exceeded the car's value.

The origins of this martial art are disputed, but its purpose was primarily self-defence. It was also used to settle arguments and matters of honour between individuals, families, and even villages. While popular in the northern mountains, it was practically unknown elsewhere, and those who did practice it were taught by masters from the North of Portugal and Galicia.  History  The popularity of this martial art was partly due to the demeanor of the northern folk, who valued personal and family honor enough to kill for it. It was also due in no small part to the relative ease of obtaining a staff as well as the versatility of such a tool: a staff or stick was almost universally present, used as a support for the long daily walks, to help cross the rivers, by the shepherds to protect the cattle from wild animals, and so on. There are references to this martial art being used by the guerrillas against the troops of Napoleon that were occupying Lisbon during the Peninsular War. = Origin = Monteiro with young students The origins of the jogo do pau are medieval civil techniques of combat, used in times of war by foot soldiers who were often poor peasants who could not afford a better weapon. Evidence of this are found, for instance, from reports on the Battle of Aljubarrota. The technique was incorporated into horseback riding in the medieval book by Edward I of Portugal (1391‚Äì1438). This martial art developed not in the urban areas more open to foreign influences, but in Galiza and the most isolated mountain regions of continental Portugal. The flag of the ancient school of jogo do pau in Ateneu During the 19th century, jogo do pau was brought to Lisboa by northern masters, resulting in an amalgamation with the technique of the Gameirosabre, growing into a sports competition, removed from actual combat. It was practiced in clubs such as the Gin√°sio Clube Portugu√™s and the Ateneu Comercial de Lisboa.  Modern practice  In the 20th century, the practice of jogo do pau suffered a quick decline due to the migrations from rural areas to the cities and the greater ease in access to firearms. The players born between 1910 and 1930 were the last generation to experience the flowering of the sport. The memories of this generation provided a continuity in the 1970s, when the sport was revived. The driving force of this revival was Pedro Ferreira, followed by his student Nuno Curvello Russo, who dedicated his life's ambition to jogo do pau, frequently visiting the North of Portugal, getting acquainted with surviving variants there, especially with the school of Cabeceiras de Basto. He studied at the Ateneu Comercial de Lisboa, whose master is now Manuel Monteiro. Today, the sport is still rather marginal in Portugal, but there is a stable number of practitioners organized in two federations: the Federa√ß√£o Portuguesa de Jogo do Pau and the Federa√ß√£o Nacional do Jogo do Pau Portugu√™s. This art is also practised in the Azores and Madeira, and outside Portugal in Galicia, Spain.

It can include alteration of the conventions of grammar or language, or the rewording of pre-existing text. History The artistic license may also refer to the ability of an artist to apply smaller distortions, such as a poet ignoring some of the minor requirements of grammar for poetic effect. For example, Mark Antony's \\"Friends, Romans, Countrymen, lend me your ears\\" from Shakespeare's Julius Caesar would technically require the word \\"and\\" before \\"countrymen\\", but the conjunction \\"and\\" is omitted to preserve the rhythm of iambic pentameter (the resulting conjunction is called an asyndetic tricolon). Conversely, on the next line, the end of \\"I come to bury Caesar, not to praise him\\" has an extra syllable because omitting the word \\"him\\" would make the sentence unclear, but adding a syllable at the end would not disrupt the meter. Both of these are examples of artistic license. Another example of artistic license is the way in which stylized images of an object (for instance in a painting or an animated movie) are different from their real life counterparts, but are still intended to be interpreted by the viewer as representing the same thing. This can mean the omission of details, or the simplification of shapes and color shades, even to the point that the image is nothing more than a pictogram. It can also mean the addition of non-existing details, or exaggeration of shapes and colours, as in fantasy art or a caricature. Certain stylizations have become fixed conventions in art; an agreement between artist and viewer that is understood and undebatable. A striking example is how in simple cartoon drawings' monochromatic white parts on a dark colored surface are immediately recognized by most viewers to represent the reflection of light on a smooth or wet surface. In summary, artistic license is: * Entirely at the artist's discretion * Intended to be tolerated by the viewer (cf. \\"willing suspension of disbelief\\") * Useful for filling in gaps, whether they be factual, compositional, historical or other gapsGoodsell, David S.; Johnson, Graham T. (2007). \\"Filling in the Gaps: Artistic License in Education and Outreach\\". PLoS Biol 5 (12). . * Used consciously or unconsciously, intentionally or unintentionally or in tandem Dramatic license Artistic license is often referred to as dramatic license when it involves the glamorization of real-world occupations for the sake of exciting television or cinematic experience. For example, CSI: Crime Scene Investigation and other police procedural programs typically omit completely the more mundane aspects of the occupation such as paperwork, reports, administrative duties and other daily \\"business-oriented\\" aspects which in reality often constitute the majority of police work. They will also present other duties with much more action, suspense or drama than would be experienced in reality. The same is also true for many military-oriented adventure stories which often show high-ranking characters being allowed to continuously enter dangerous situations when in reality, they would usually be restricted to command-oriented and administrative duties. Controversy and criticism Artistic license often provokes controversy by offending those who resent the reinterpretation of cherished beliefs or previous works. Artists often respond to these criticisms by pointing out that their work was not intended to be a verbatim portrayal of something previous and should be judged only on artistic merit. Artistic license is a generally accepted practice, particularly when the result is widely acclaimed. William Shakespeare's historical plays, for example, are gross distortions of historical fact but are nevertheless lauded as outstanding literary works. Critical voices are sometimes raised when artistic license is applied to cinematic and other depictions of real historical events. While slight manipulation for dramatic effect of chronology and character traits are generally accepted, some critics feel that depictions that present a significantly altered reality are irresponsible, particularly because many viewers and readers do not know the actual events and may thus take the dramatized depiction to be true to reality. Examples of films and television series criticized for excessive use of dramatic license include Disney's Pocahontas, Mel Gibson's Braveheart, Oliver Stone's Alexander, the HBO series Rome, 20th Century Fox's The Greatest Showman and Showtime's The Tudors. Writers adapting a work for another medium (e.g., a film screenplay from a book) often make significant changes, additions to, or omissions from the original plot in the book, on the grounds that these changes were necessary to make a good film.Film review (1999). Issues 14‚Äì16. Orpheus Pub. These changes are sometimes to the dismay of fans of the original work.

Origins He was born on 22 January 1571 in Denton, Huntingdonshire, the son and heir of Thomas Cotton (1544‚Äì1592) of Conington (son of Thomas Cotton of Conington Sheriff of Huntingdonshire in 1547Vivian, Lt.Col.

The Cotton family originated at the manor of Cotton, Cheshire,Vivian, p.240 from which they took their surname. Education Cotton was educated at Westminster School where he was a pupil of the antiquarian William Camden, under whose influence he began to study antiquarian topics. He began collecting rare manuscripts as well as collecting notes on the history of Huntingdonshire when he was seventeen.\\"Robert Cotton, 1571‚Äì1631.\\" Robert Cotton, 1571‚Äì1631. Montague Millennium Inc., 22 February 2006. Web. He proceeded to Jesus College, Cambridge, where he graduated BA in 1585 and in 1589 entered the Middle Temple to study law. He began to amass a library in which the documents rivalled, then surpassed, the royal manuscript collections. Career Cotton was elected a Member of Parliament for Newtown, Isle of Wight in 1601 and as Knight of the Shire for Huntingdonshire in 1604. He helped to devise the institution of the title of baronet as a means for King James I to raise funds: like a peerage, a baronetcy was heritable but, like a knighthood, it gave the holder no seat in the House of Lords. Despite an early period of goodwill with King James I, during which Cotton was himself made a baronet, his approach to public life, based on his immersion in the study of old documents, was essentially based on that \\"sacred obligation of the king to put his trust in parliaments\\" which in 1628 was expressed in his monograph The Dangers wherein the Kingdom now Standeth, and the Remedye. From the Court party's point of view, this was anti-royalist in nature, and the king's ministers began to fear the uses being made of Cotton's library to support pro-parliamentarian arguments. Thus it was confiscated in 1630 and returned only after his death to his heirs. Role in Parliament A bust of Robert Cotton by Louis-Fran√ßois Roubiliac Cotton supported the claim of King James VI of Scotland to succeed Queen Elizabeth I on the English throne, and after the queen's death was commissioned to write a work defending James's claim to the throne, for which he was rewarded with a knighthood in 1603. Cotton was elected to parliament for Huntingdonshire in 1604, a constituency previously represented by his grandfather. Cotton worked on the Committee on Grievances and in 1605‚Äì06 received the Bill pertaining to the Gunpowder Plot through his work on the Committee of Privileges. In 1607 he was reappointed to the Committee of Privileges. Cotton was appointed to the joint conference with the Lords during his work on the bill pertaining to the full union between Scotland and England in 1606‚Äì07. In 1610 Cotton was nominated in first place to the Committee of Privileges. In 1610/11 the royal revenues were low, and Cotton wrote Means for raising the king‚Äôs estate. In this work he suggested the formation of the baronetcy a new higher order of social rank, higher than the knight but lower than the baron. Cotton was not elected to the 1614 Parliament. In 1621 Cotton advised James I on the impeachment of Sir Francis Bacon concerning the respective roles of king and Parliament. In 1624 Cotton was elected to represent Old Sarum after the previous member, Sir Arthur Ingram, decided to sit for York. He was subsequently elected to Parliament for Old Sarum (1624), Thetford (1625) and Castle Rising (1628). The Society of Antiquaries Cotton reunited with his former schoolmaster William Camden in the late 1580s as an early member of the Society of Antiquaries. Camden was one of the greatest early antiquarians, whose 1586 work Britannia was a chorographical (topographical and historical) survey of Britain.Howarth, D. Sir Robert Cotton and the Commemoration of Famous Men. British Library Cotton exerted little influence in the society until after his father's death in 1592. In 1593 he was resident at the family seat of Conington Castle, which he rebuilt. He returned to London in 1598 and revived the Society and petitioned for a permanent academy for antiquarian studies, suggesting that Cotton's collection of manuscripts be combined with the Queen's library to form a national library. The plan did not receive royal approval. The discussion of the Society in the summer of 1600 focused on ancient burial customs, probably the result of a recent visit to Hadrian's Wall by Camden and Cotton during which they collected Roman coins, monuments and fossils. The trip appears to have initiated Cotton's interest in Roman artefacts. The antiquarians Reginald Bainbridge and Lord William Howard offered Cotton Roman stones while the Essex antiquarian John Barkham arranged to send him Roman relics. Cotton's antiquarian studies influenced many people of his time and he was often looked to by other antiquarians for ideas. Below is a letter written by fellow antiquarian Roger Dodsworth to Cotton asking for advice: The last recorded meeting of the Society of Antiquaries was in 1607. Cotton, however, continued collecting. Marriage and progeny As a young man, Cotton may have contracted a (possibly irregular) marriage with Frideswide Faunt, daughter of William Faunt of Foston, Leicestershire, and sister of the Jesuit theologian Arthur Faunt. The marriage was recorded by William Burton, Frideswide's nephew, but is not mentioned in Cotton's own papers. In about 1593 (the precise date is not known), he married Elizabeth Brocas, the daughter of William Brocas of Theddingworth in Leicestershire. This marriage took place about a year after the death of Cotton's father, and helped to shore up his financial position, as Elizabeth was an heiress. Their subsequent marital history suggests that perhaps these factors outweighed personal compatibility. By Elizabeth, Cotton had a son: Sir Thomas Cotton, 2nd Baronet (1594‚Äì1662). Sir Thomas in turn married Margaret Howard, by whom he had a son, Sir John Cotton (born 1621). Sir Robert had an extensive circle of friends and a considerable capacity to charm, which he displayed both before and after marrying. He spent several years, and possibly more than a decade, living with the widowed Lady Hunsdon, perhaps as her lover during an overt separation from his wife. Eventually the Cottons patched things up. Nonetheless, a reputation as something of a playboy attached to Sir Robert until the end of his life. Library The Cottonian Library was the richest private collection of manuscripts ever amassed. Of secular libraries it outranked the Royal Library, the collections of the Inns of Court and the College of Arms. Cotton's collection even included the original codex bound manuscript of Beowulf, written around the year 1000. Cotton's house near the Palace of Westminster became the meeting-place of the Society of Antiquaries of London and of all the eminent scholars of England. the Library was eventually donated to the nation by Cotton's grandson and is now housed in the British Library. The physical arrangement of Cotton's Library continues to be reflected in citations to manuscripts formerly in his possession. His library was housed in a room long by six feet wide filled with bookpresses, each surmounted by the bust of a figure from classical antiquity. Counterclockwise, these were catalogued as Julius, Augustus, Cleopatra, Faustina, Tiberius, Caligula, Claudius, Nero, Galba, Otho, Vitellius, Vespasian, Titus, and Domitian. (Domitian had only one shelf, perhaps because it was over the door). Manuscripts are today designated by library, bookpress, and number: for example, the manuscript of Beowulf is designated Cotton Vitellius A.xv, and the manuscript of Pearl is Cotton Nero A.x. Role of family on the Cotton library Sir Robert Cotton began developing the works and manuscripts into a collection for his Library shortly after the birth of his son in 1594. From the period 1609 to 1614 the deaths of various people (including Lord Lumley, Earl of Salisbury, Prince Henry, William Dethick and Northampton) all contributed to Sir Robert Cotton's purchase of works for his library. Sir Robert Cotton resided in London, while his wife and son remained in the country. During his father's absence Thomas Cotton studied to eventually receive his BA on 24 October 1616 from Broadgates Hall‚Äîthe very same year that Sir Robert Cotton returned to his wife Elizabeth and family (a result of a hiccup with the law involving the death of earl of Somerset). At that point, Sir Thomas Cotton had taken the responsibilities of the home and the library into his own hands. Robert Cotton in 1629, the year that he was forced to close the Cotton library by Charles I because the content within the library was believed to be harmful to the interests of the Royalists In 1620, Thomas Cotton married Margaret Howard with whom he had his first son, Sir John Cotton, just one year later in 1621. Sir Thomas Cotton's marriage with Margaret Howard ended in 1622, which had been the year that Thomas Cotton's father, Sir Robert Cotton, permanently moved residence to The Cotton House, along with the library which remained in the Cotton House until Sir Robert Cotton's death nine years later in 1631. The relocation of the library and residence to the Cotton House gave members of Parliament and government workers better access to the matter within the library to be used as resources for their work. The Cotton Library offered important and valuable sources of reference and knowledge to many people, such as John Selden, \\"a frequent borrower from the library, and probably its protector during the civil wars\\" as stated in the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography. Selden, in 1623 said of Cotton: ‚Äúhis kindness and willingness to make them [his collection of books and manuscripts] available to students of good literature and affairs of state\\".Smith, T. \\"Catalogue of the manuscripts in the Cottonian Library, 1696 / Catalogus librorum manuscriptorum bibliothecae Cottonianae.\\" Ed. C. G. C. Tite (1696); repr. (1984). In keeping with the notion that John Selden was a common presence in the Cotton library, The British Library holds a list of thirteen works, and the locations of those volumes today, that had been lent to Seldon by Sir Robert Cotton. After another hiccup with the government, Sir Robert Cotton was forced to close the library by Charles I because the content within the library was believed to be harmful to the interests of the Royalists in 1629. In September 1630 Sir Robert Cotton and Sir Thomas Cotton, together, petitioned for renewed access to their library. One year later, in 1631, Sir Robert Cotton died without knowing what the future held for his library, but wrote in his will that the library be left to his son Thomas Cotton and that it be passed down accordingly. After the death of his father, Sir Thomas Cotton married his second wife, Alice Constable, in 1640 with whom they had their son Robert Cotton in 1644. Sir Thomas Cotton's \\"ownership access to the Cotton library was more limited than under his father\\" according to the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, and Thomas Cotton maintained his ability to \\"protect,\\" \\"improve\\" and \\"maximize the profits\\" received during the civil war, as he had earlier on in his life as a result of his father's absence. Upon the death of Sir Robert Cotton on 13 May 1662, Sir Thomas Cotton obeyed the will of his father and passed down the library to his eldest son from his first marriage, Sir John Cotton. On 12 September 1702, Sir John Cotton died. Prior to his death, Sir John Cotton had arranged for the Cotton Library to be bought for the nation of England through acts of Parliament. If the library had not been sold to the nation, despite the wish of his grandfather Sir Robert Cotton, the library would have been taken over and inherited by John Cotton's two grandsons, who, unlike the rest of the college- educated Cotton family, had been illiterate and put the Cotton Library at risk of potentially getting broken up and sold to different divisions within the family. =Selected manuscripts= Cotton Nero A.x. *Cotton Julius A.x Old English Martyrology *Cotton Augustus II.106 Magna Carta: Exemplification of 1215 *Cotton Cleopatra A.ii Life of St Modwenna *Cotton Faustina A.x Additional Glosses to the Glossary in √Ülfric's Grammar *Cotton Tiberius B.v Labour of the Months *Cotton Caligula A.ii \\"A Pistil of Susan\\" (frag.) *Cotton Claudius B.iv Genesis *Cotton Nero A.x.

Itagaki was a main conspirator behind the Mukden Incident and held prestigious chief of staff posts in the Kwantung Army and China Expeditionary Army during the early Second Sino-Japanese War. Itagaki became War Minister but fell from grace after Japanese defeat in the Soviet‚ÄìJapanese border conflicts, serving as general for several field armies until surrendering Japanese forces in Southeast Asia in 1945. Itagaki was convicted of war crimes by the International Military Tribunal for the Far East and executed in 1948. Early life Seishir≈ç Itagaki was born on 21 January 1885 in Morioka, Iwate Prefecture, into a former samurai family that had served the Nanbu clan of the Morioka Domain. Itagaki's father, Masanori Itagaki, served as mayor for Kesen District and as a headmaster for a girls school. Itagaki was raised in a Nichiren Buddhist family belonging to the Nichiren-sh≈´ sect. Itagaki attended the junior high school in Morioka (at the same time Ky≈çsuke Kindaichi, Koshir≈ç Oikawa, and Kod≈ç Nomura) before attending the regional military school in Sendai. Military career The newly appointed War Minister Itagaki (center, stepping down from the rock) with his vice-minister Hideki T≈çj≈ç (right) and Navy minister Mitsumasa Yonai (left, in black Navy uniform, standing on the rock) Itagaki entered the Imperial Japanese Army Academy, where he befriended numerous notable Japanese military figures including Yasuji Okamura, Kenji Doihara, and Tetsuzan Nagata. Itagaki graduated from the Army Academy in 1904 and fought in the Russo-Japanese War. Itagaki married Kikuko Ogoshi, the daughter of his former mentor Kenkichi Ogoshi who died in the Battle of Mukden. From 1924 to 1926, Itagaki was a military attach√© assigned to the Japanese embassy in China. On his return to Japan, he held a number of staff positions within the Imperial Japanese Army General Staff until 1927 before being given a field command as commanding officer of the IJA 33rd Infantry Brigade based in China. His brigade was attached to the IJA 10th Division from 1927 to 1928. Itagaki was then transferred to command the IJA 33rd Infantry Regiment in China from 1928 to 1929, under the aegis of the prestigious Kwantung Army. In 1931, Itagaki rose to become Chief of the Intelligence Section of the Kwantung Army, in which capacity he helped plan the 1931 Mukden Incident that led to the Japanese seizure of Manchuria.Budge, the Pacific War Online Encyclopedia Itagaki was subsequently a military advisor to the Japanese puppet state of Manchukuo from 1932 to 1934. In 1934, Itagaki became Vice Chief of Staff of the Kwantung Army, and in 1936 was promoted to Chief of Staff.Ammenthorp, The Generals of World War II From 1937 to 1938, Itagaki was commander of the IJA 5th Division in China during the early stages of the Second Sino-Japanese War, and his division took a leading part in the Battle of Beiping‚ÄìTianjin, Operation Chahar, and the Battle of Taiyuan. However, in the Battle of Xuzhou his forces were repulsed during the Battle of Taierzhuang in the vicinity of Linyi that prevented them from coming to the aid of Rensuke Isogai's IJA 10th Division.Fuller, Shokan, Hirohito's Samurai Itagaki was recalled to Japan in 1938, briefly serving as War Minister from 1938 to 1939. On 6 December 1938, Itagaki proposed a national policy in accordance with Hakko Ichiu (Expansion) at the Five Ministers Conference, which was the Japanese highest decision making council, and the council made a decision of prohibiting the expulsion of the Jews in Japan, Manchuria, and China as Japanese national policy. Itagaki returned to China again as chief of staff of the China Expeditionary Army from 1939 to 1941. However, in the summer of 1939, the unexpected defeat of Japanese forces against the Soviet Union at the Battle of Khalkhin Gol, the decisive battle of the Soviet‚ÄìJapanese border conflicts, was a major blow to his career. Itagaki was reassigned to command the Chosen Army in Korea, then considered to be a non-prestigious backwater post. As the war situation continued to deteriorate for Japan, the Chosen Army was elevated to the Japanese Seventeenth Area Army in 1945, with Itagaki still as commander in chief. Itagaki was then reassigned to the Japanese Seventh Area Army in Singapore and Malaya in April 1945. Itagaki surrendered Japanese forces in Southeast Asia to British Admiral Louis Mountbatten in Singapore on 12 September 1945. Death After the war, Itagaki was taken into custody by the Supreme Commander of the Allied Powers authorities and charged with war crimes, specifically in connection with the Japanese seizure of Manchuria, his escalation of the war against the Allies during his term as War Minister, and for allowing inhumane treatment of prisoners of war during his term as commander of Japanese forces in Southeast Asia. Itagaki was found guilty on counts 1, 27, 29, 31, 32, 35, 36 and 54 and was condemned to death in 1948 by the International Military Tribunal for the Far East.

The resolutions were a long series of demands for political reforms in the British-governed colony. Papineau had been elected speaker of the legislative assembly of Lower Canada in 1815. His party constantly opposed the unelected colonial government, and in 1828 he helped draft an early form of the resolutions, essentially a list of grievances against the colonial administration. To ensure that the views of the Legislative Assembly be understood by the British House of Commons, the Parti patriote had sent its own delegation to London in order to submit a memoir and a petition signed by 87,000 people. On February 28, 1834, Papineau presented the Ninety-Two Resolutions to the Legislative Assembly which were approved and sent to London. The resolutions included, among other things, demands for an elected Legislative Council and an Executive Council responsible before the house of representatives. Under the Constitutional Act of 1791, the government of Lower Canada was given an elected legislative assembly, but members of the upper houses were appointed by the Governor of the colony. In the resolutions, the elected representatives once again reiterated their loyalty to the British Crown, but expressed frustration that the government of London had been unwilling to correct the injustices caused by the past governments of the colony. Papineau's resolutions were ignored for almost three years; meanwhile, the Legislative Assembly did all it could to oppose the un-elected upper houses while avoiding outright rebellion. British Colonial Secretary Lord Russell eventually responded to them by issuing ten resolutions of his own (the Russell Resolutions). All of the Legislative Assembly's demands were rejected. The ten resolutions reached Canada in 1837, and many of Papineau's reformists began to agitate for a rebellion. See the Lower Canada Rebellion.

(29 March 1826 ‚Äì 7 August 1900) was a German socialist and one of the principal founders of the Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD). His political career was a pioneering project combining Marxist revolutionary theory with practical legal political activity. Under his leadership, the SPD grew from a tiny sect to become Germany's largest political party. He was the father of Karl Liebknecht and Theodor Liebknecht.  Biography  = Early years = Wilhelm Liebknecht was born in 1826 in Giessen, the son of Katharina Elisabeth Henrietta (n√©e Hirsch) and Hessian public official Ludwig Christian Liebknecht. Liebknecht grew up with relatives after the death of his parents in 1832. From 1832 to 1842, he went to school at the Gymnasium of Giessen, then began studying philology, theology and philosophy in Giessen, Berlin and Marburg. After some trouble with the authorities as a result of participating in student radicalism, Liebknecht decided to emigrate to the United States. While on a train to a port city, quite by chance, he met the headmaster of a progressive school in Zurich, Switzerland, and Liebknecht impulsively decided to accept an offer to be an unpaid teacher at that school. Thus he found himself in Switzerland in 1847 as a civil war began in that country. He reported these events for a German newspaper, the Mannheimer Abendzeitung, beginning a career in journalism that he would pursue for the next five decades. = Revolution of 1848 = When revolution erupted in Paris in February 1848, Liebknecht hurried to the scene. He arrived too late to do much in Paris, but he did join a legion that was traveling to Germany to instigate revolution there. During that poorly planned expedition, he was arrested in Baden and charged with treason. On the eve of his trial, revolution erupted once more, and a mob secured his release. He then became a member of the Badische Volkswehr and an adjutant of Gustav von Struve and fought in the ill-fated Reichverfassungsk√§mpfe (\\"federal constitution wars\\"). After the revolutionaries' defeat, he escaped to Switzerland and became a leading member of the Genfer Arbeiterverein (Worker's Association of Geneva), where he met Friedrich Engels. = Years of exile = In 1850, Liebknecht was arrested for his initiatives to unite Switzerland's German workers' associations and was banished from the country. With few options available, like many veterans of the recently failed revolution, he relocated his exile to London, where he stayed from 1850 to 1862. There he became a member of the Communist League. During these years, he developed a lifelong friendship and collaboration with Karl Marx. In 1862, after an amnesty for the participants in the revolution of 1848, he returned to Germany and became a member of Ferdinand Lassalle's General German Workers' Association (Allgemeiner Deutscher Arbeiterverein, ADAV), the precursor of the Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD). = Return to Germany = From 1864 to 1865, Liebknecht also worked for the magazine Der Social-Demokrat (The Social Democrat) published by Jean Baptista von Schweitzer. However, he soon found himself in disagreement with the paper's friendly position toward Prussia and its new Minister-President Otto von Bismarck. So Liebknecht quit the editorial staff and was forced to leave the ADAV due to pressure from Schweitzer. After being evicted from Berlin by government authorities, Liebknecht moved to Leipzig where he met August Bebel, with whom he founded the S√§chsische Volkspartei (Saxon People's Party) in 1867 and the Social Democratic Workers' Party of Germany (Sozialdemokratische Arbeiterpartei Deutschlands, SDAP) in 1869 in Eisenach. During these years, he was elected to the national legislature, where he conducted a determined but futile opposition to Bismarck's policies. Liebknecht was also the editor of the party newspaper, Der Volksstaat (The People's State). When the Franco- Prussian War began in 1870, Liebknecht used his newspaper to agitate against the war, calling on working men on both sides of the border to unite in overthrowing the ruling class. As a result, he and Bebel were arrested and charged with treason. It is worth noting that Liebknecht opposed the war regardless of which side started it. His call for revolutionary opposition to the war directly contradicts what his party (the SPD) would do in 1914 when World War I began as at that time, with Liebknecht long dead, his successors opted to back the German cause in the war. = Treason trial = In 1872, both Liebknecht and Bebel were convicted and sentenced to two years of Festungshaft (\\"imprisonment in a fortress\\"). This was one of sixteen times that Liebknecht's politics resulted in his conviction and incarceration. = Return to politics = After being re-elected to the Reichstag in 1874, Liebknecht played a key role in the merger of the SDAP and Lassalle's ADAV into the Socialist Worker's Party of Germany (Sozialistische Arbeiterpartei Deutschlands, SAPD) in Gotha in 1875. He also became publisher of the newly founded party organ Vorw√§rts (Forward), arguing for the integration of Marxist theories into the SAPD's program in his articles. From 1878 to 1890, the German government outlawed Liebknecht's party, but the terms of the law allowed the party to participate in elections and its elected delegates to participate in the Reichstag. Liebknecht used his position as a Reichstag member to criticize the political situation and opposed the tendencies in his own party toward anarchism on the one hand and accommodation with Bismarck on the other. Maintaining a radical and unified stance, the SPD emerged from outlawry in 1890 with 20% of the vote in the Reichstag election. In 1891, Liebknecht became editor-in-chief of Vorw√§rts and one of the originators of the SPD's new Marxist-inspired party platform. Throughout that decade, he continued to serve in the Reichstag and to appear at political conventions of the SPD as a prominent referent. Despite his advanced age, he also was a major organizer of the Second Socialist International. = Death and legacy = Liebknecht died aged 74 on 7 August 1900 in Charlottenburg, a suburb of Berlin. 50,000 people joined his funeral procession.

Early life  Favaloro was born in 1923 and raised in La Plata; his grandparents were Sicilians. At an early age, he developed a love for football, favoring Gimnasia y Esgrima La Plata, a popular club in the city. In 1936, Favaloro was admitted into the Colegio Nacional de La Plata. After graduating from high school, he was admitted to the School of Medicine at the National University of La Plata. During his third year, he began his medical residency at the Hospital Policl√≠nico San Mart√≠n, a medical center that received the most complicated cases from much of Buenos Aires province. This residency brought him into contact with patients for the first time. He attended procedures carried out by professors Jos√© Mar√≠a Mainetti and Federico E. B. Christmann, from whom he learned the simplicity and standardization that he would later apply to cardiovascular surgery, one of his many great contributions to cardiovascular operating techniques. Favaloro graduated with a medical degree in 1949. He then applied for a position as a medical auxiliary, but the offer required him to enroll in the Peronist Party, which he did not accept. He moved instead to a small town named Jacinto Ar√°uz in La Pampa Province after being offered a job as the town's doctor; when the resident doctor died, he succeeded him and brought his brother Juan Jos√© into the clinic. He married Mar√≠a Antonia Delgado in 1951. Favaloro and his brother endeavored to improve the general level of health in what was then a remote region. They trained and educated the general public, teachers, and nurses and improved health-care delivery. They equipped the town with an operating room and X-ray and improved the laboratory, thereby providing essential surgical and diagnostic tools.  Thoracic surgery  Favaloro with F. Mason Sones, Jr., at the Cleveland Clinic Favaloro became interested in developments in cardiovascular intervention, and developed an enthusiasm for thoracic surgery. During a visit to La Plata, he met Professor Mainetti, who pointed him in the direction of the Cleveland Clinic. Although in the beginning he had doubts about leaving his profession as a rural physician, he thought that he could make a greater contribution to the community on returning from the United States. With few resources and rudimentary English, he decided to travel to Cleveland. He first worked as a resident and later as a member of the surgical team, working with Donald B. Effler, head of cardiovascular surgery, F. Mason Sones, Jr., who was in charge of the Angiography Laboratory, and William L. Proudfit, head of the Department of Cardiology. In the beginning, the major part of his work involved valvular and congenital diseases; later on, he became interested in other areas. Every day, having hardly finished working in the operating room, Favaloro would spend hours and hours reviewing coronary angiograms and studying coronary arteries and their relation with the cardiac muscle. The laboratory of Sones, father of the coronary angiography, had the largest collection of angiograms in the United States. In early 1967, Favaloro began to consider the possibility of using the saphenous vein in coronary surgery. He put his ideas into practice for the first time in May of that year. The basic principle was to bypass a diseased (obstructed) segment of a coronary artery in order to deliver blood flow distally. The standardization of this technique, called coronary artery bypass surgery, was the fundamental work of his career, and ensured that his prestige would transcend the limits of his country, as the procedure radically changed the treatment of coronary disease. In 1970, he published one of his best-known volumes, Surgical Treatment of Coronary Arteriosclerosis. The Favaloro Foundation Favaloro enjoys a light moment with Nobel Laureate Dr. Luis Leloir and Leloir's wife, Amelia. Favaloro returned to Argentina in 1971 with the dream of developing a center of excellence similar to the Cleveland Clinic, that combined medical attention, research, and education. Bearing that in mind, he founded the Fundaci√≥n Favaloro in 1975 along with several collaborators. He took pride in having trained more than 450 residents from all over Argentina and the Americas. Favaloro contributed to raise the standard level of his specialty for the benefit of patients through innumerable courses, seminars, and conferences organized by the Fundaci√≥n, among them the distinguished \\"Cardiology for the Consultant\\" (Cardiolog√≠a para el Consultante), held every two years. In 1980 Favaloro established the \\"Basic Investigation Laboratory\\" (Laboratorio de Investigaci√≥n B√°sica), which was long financed with his own money and which, at the time, depended upon the support of the Research and Teaching Department of the Fundaci√≥n Favaloro. Subsequently, it became the Institute of Research in Basic Sciences of the University Institute of Biomedical Sciences (Instituto de Investigaci√≥n en Ciencias B√°sicas del Instituto Universitario de Ciencias Biom√©dicas) which in turn, was transformed into the Universidad Favaloro in August 1998. In 1992 the nonprofit Favaloro Foundation Institute of Cardiology and Cardiovascular Surgery (Instituto de Cardiolog√≠a y Cirug√≠a Cardiovascular de la Fundaci√≥n Favaloro) opened in Buenos Aires. With the motto \\"advanced technology in the service of medical humanism\\", this institute offers highly specialized services of cardiology, cardiovascular surgery and heart, lung, cardiopulmonary, liver, kidney, and bone marrow transplants, among other areas. Favaloro focused his career there, surrounded by a selected group of professionals. One of his more famous patients was boxing promoter and Luna Park arena owner Tito Lectoure, on whom Dr. Favaloro operated in 1990. It should be mentioned, however, that despite the immense costs of bypass surgery, Dr Favaloro operated daily on indigent patients, something that he felt was both a necessity and his obligation. He kept his emphasis on disease prevention and promoting basic rules of hygiene to reduce mortality rate. With that objective, the Fundaci√≥n Favaloro researches illness detection and prevention programs. Also, many publications were released by the Centro Editor de la Fundaci√≥n Favaloro (Publishing Center of the Favaloro Foundation), which ceased to operate in 2000. The Favaloro Foundation is currently one of the largest institutions dedicated to cardiology in the Americas.  Death  By 2000, Argentina was submerged in an economic and political crisis, and the Favaloro Foundation was US$18 million in debt. On repeated occasions, Favaloro petitioned the Argentine government to aid the Foundation, but never received an official response, nor would the director of the PAMI public medical insurance agency, Horacio Rodr√≠guez Larreta, agree to pay the agency's debt to the Foundation. On July 29, 2000, at age 77, Favaloro fatally shot himself in the chest. Following his suicide, it was revealed that he had written a letter to Argentine President Fernando de la R√∫a, that had never been read, in which he expressed being tired of \\"being a beggar in his own country,\\" and asked for de la R√∫a's help to raise money for the Foundation. Although his suicide is often linked to the Foundation‚Äôs financial difficulties, the letter clearly shows Favaloro felt overwhelmed by the corruption of the health system and that he could not fight against this powerful organization. In the letter, he refers to himself as ‚ÄúDon Quixote‚Äù in his lonely battle against the giants. Aggravating this situation was that Favaloro had never recovered from the death of his wife in 1998. Following her death, he had resolved to marry one of his longtime colleagues and coauthors, Diana Truden; she lived with Favaloro during his final days and was in his Palermo neighborhood house when he died by suicide.  Recognitions and distinctions  Favaloro was an active member of 26 societies, corresponding of 4, and honorary of 43. He received innumerable international distinctions. The ones that stand out are: John Scott Prize 1979, granted by Philadelphia; the creation of the Chair of Cardiovascular Surgery \\"Dr Ren√© G. Favaloro\\" (Tel Aviv University, Israel, 1980); the distinction of the Fundaci√≥n Conchita R√°bago de Gim√©nez D√≠az (Madrid, Spain, 1982); the Teacher Prize of Argentinian Medicine (1986); the Distinguished Alumnus Award of the Cleveland Clinic Foundation (1987); The Gairdner Foundation International Award, granted by the Gairdner Foundation (Toronto, Canada, 1987); the Ren√© Leriche Prize 1989, granted by the International Surgery Society; the Gifted Teacher Award, granted by the American College of Cardiology (1992); the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement (1993); the Diamond Konex Award as the most important scientist in the last decade in his country (Argentina, 1993); and the Prince Mahidol Award, granted by His Majesty the King of Thailand (Bangkok, Thailand, 1999). In 2007, he was named the second-greatest Argentine of all time, on the TV show El Gen Argentino. On July 12, 2019, Google showed a Doodle celebrating what would have been his 96th birthday.  Favaloro on television  Favaloro participated in educational programming for the public, distinguishing himself in the television series The Great Medical Themes, and in numerous conferences in Argentina and throughout the world on topics such as medicine, education, and modern society. He was also mentioned in the documentary movie Forks Over Knives.  Works  Ren√© Favaloro published more than three hundred works in his specialty. Owing to his passion for history, he also wrote two books about General Jos√© de San Mart√≠n. * Surgical Treatment of Coronary Arteriosclerosis (1970) * Recuerdos de un m√©dico rural (\\"Memories of a rural doctor\\", 1980) * ¬øConoce usted a San Mart√≠n?

He and Itagaki Seishir≈ç were the men primarily responsible for the Mukden Incident that took place in Manchuria in 1931. Early life Ishiwara was born in Tsuruoka City, Yamagata Prefecture, into a samurai class family. His father was a police officer, but as his clan had supported the Tokugawa bakufu and then the Northern Alliance during the Boshin War of the Meiji Restoration, its members were shut out of higher government positions. At 13, Ishiwara was enrolled in a military preparatory school. He was subsequently accepted at the 21st class of the Imperial Japanese Army Academy and graduated in 1909. He served in the IJA 65th Infantry Regiment in Korea after its annexation by Japan in 1910, and in 1915, he passed the exams for admittance to the 30th class of the Army Staff College. He graduated second in his class in 1918.. Ishiwara spent several years in various staff assignments and then was selected to study in Germany as a military attach√©. He stayed in Berlin and in Munich from 1922 to 1925, focusing on military history and military strategy. He hired several former officers from the German General Staff to tutor him, and by the time that he returned to Japan, he had formed a considerable background on military theory and doctrine. Prior to leaving for Germany, Ishiwara had converted to Nichiren Buddhism. Nichiren had taught that a period of massive conflict would precede a golden era of human culture in which the truth of Buddhism would prevail. Japan would be the center and main promulgator of the faith, which would encompass the entire world. Ishiwara felt that the period of world conflict was fast approaching, and Japan, relying upon its vision of the kokutai and its sacred mission to \\"liberate\\" China, would lead a unified East Asia to defeat the West.. Ishiwara was also the leader of a semi-religious and Pan-Asianist organization, the East-Asia League Movement (T≈çarenmei und≈ç).G. Clinton Godart \\"Nichirenism, Utopianism, and Modernity Rethinking Ishiwara Kanji's East Asia League Movement\\" (Japanese Journal of Religious Studies, 42/2, December 2015, pp. 235-274) Colonel Ishiwara in 1934. At the time he was the commander of the 4th Infantry Regiment in Sendai. Ishiwara and Manchuria Ishiwara was assigned to the Army Staff College as an instructor, followed by a staff position within the Kwantung Army in Manchuria. He arrived there at the end of 1928, some months after the assassination of Zhang Zuolin. Ishiwara quickly realized that the confused political situation in northern China, along with Japan's already significant economic investments in the area, provided the Kwantung Army with a unique opportunity. He and Colonel Seishiro Itagaki began formulating a plan to take advantage of the situation. On 18 September 1931, a bomb was secretly planted on the tracks of the Japanese-controlled Southern Manchuria Railway by Kwantung Army elements. Charging that Chinese soldiers had attacked the rail line, Ishiwara ordered Japanese troops to seize the Chinese military barracks in the nearby city of Liutiaokou. He then ordered Kwantung Army units to seize control of all other Manchurian cities without informing the new commander-in-chief of the Kwantung Army, General Shigeru Honjo, or the Imperial Japanese Army General Staff in Tokyo. The sudden invasion of Manchuria alarmed political leaders in Japan, and brought condemnation down on the country from the international community. Ishiwara thought it most likely that he would be executed or at least dishonorably discharged for his insubordination. However, the success of the operation brought just the opposite. Ishiwara was admired by right-wing younger officers and ultranationalist societies for his daring and initiative. He returned to Japan and was given command of the IJA 4th Infantry Regiment in Sendai. Army revolutionaries Ishiwara was appointed to the Imperial Japanese Army General Staff in 1935 as Chief of Operations, which gave him primary responsibility for articulating his vision for Japan's future. He was a strong proponent of pan-Asianism and the hokushin-ron (\\"strike north\\") philosophy, as opposed to the nanshin-ron (\\"strike south\\") philosophy espoused by the Imperial Japanese Navy (IJN). The strike north view held that Japan should join with Manchukuo (the Japanese puppet state created out of occupied Manchuria in 1932) and China to form an \\"East Asian League\\", which would then prepare for and fight a war with the Soviet Union. After the Soviet Union was defeated, Japan could move to the south to free Southeast Asia from European colonial rule. Following this victory, Japan would then be ready to tackle the United States. However, in order to implement these plans, Japan would need to build up its economy and military. Ishiwara envisioned a one-party \\"national defense state\\" with a command economy in which political parties were abolished and venal politicians and greedy businessmen removed from power. However, Ishiwara stopped short of calling for a Sh≈çwa Restoration and violent overthrow of the government. When the February 26 Incident erupted in 1936, rebels assassinated a number of major politicians and government leaders and demanded a change in government in line with Ishiwara's philosophies. However, Ishiwara dashed their hopes by speaking out strongly against the rebellion and demanding proclamation of martial law. After Vice Chief of Staff Hajime Sugiyama pulled troops in from garrisons around Tokyo, Ishiwara was named Operations Officer of the Martial Law Headquarters. Return to Manchukuo and disgrace In March 1937 Ishiwara was promoted to major general and transferred back to Manchukuo as Vice Chief of Staff of the Kwantung Army. He discovered to his dismay that his Army colleagues had no intention of creating a new pan-Asian paradise, and were quite content to play the role of colonial occupiers. Ishiwara denounced the Kwantung Army leadership, and proposed that all officers take a pay cut. He confronted the Kwantung Army commander-in- chief, General Hideki Tojo, over his allocation of funds to an officers' wives club. After becoming an embarrassment to his seniors, he was relieved of command and reassigned to a local army base at Maizuru, on the seacoast near Kyoto. Back in Japan, he began to analyze Soviet tactics at Nomonhan, where Japanese forces were defeated, proposing counter-strategies to be adopted by the Army. He wrote and gave public addresses, continuing to advocate an East Asia League partnership with China and Manchukuo and continuing to oppose the invasion of China. He became a lieutenant general in 1939 and was assigned command of the IJA 16th Division. Ishiwara's political nemesis, T≈çj≈ç, now risen to the highest ranks, felt that the outspoken Ishiwara should be retired from the Army, but feared the reactions of young officers and right-wing activists. Finally, after Ishiwara publicly denounced T≈çj≈ç as an enemy of Japan who should \\"be arrested and executed,\\" he was put on the retired list. Ishiwara went back to Yamagata, where he continued to write and study agriculture until the end of the war. After World War II, the Supreme Commander of the Allied Powers called upon Ishiwara as a witness for the defense in the International Military Tribunal for the Far East. No charges were ever brought against Ishiwara himself, possibly due to his public opposition to T≈çj≈ç, the war in China, and the attack on Pearl Harbor. He displayed his old fire in front of the American prosecutor, arguing that U.S. President Harry S. Truman should be indicted for the mass bombing of Japanese civilians.Maga, Judgement at Tokyo In popular culture Ishiwara is a supporting character in the Japanese historical fantasy novel Teito Monogatari by Hiroshi Aramata. Ishiwara is a prominent supporting character in the Japanese alternate history manga Zipang and also the anime version. His beliefs regarding the clash of civilizations between the East and the West, involvement in the Manchurian incident, views on Pan-Asianism, and perspectives on World War II form important parts of the plot. Murakami Haruki, in the novel The Wind-up Bird Chronicle, also refers to Ishiwara as his strategic concept. Ishiwara is a supporting character in the Japanese alternate history anime series Night Raid 1931, set in China and Japan and chronicling a secret conspiracy of superpowered spies and military officers mainly in Manchukuo, the puppet state of the Empire of Japan in Northeast China and Inner Mongolia from 1932 until 1945. Ishiwara is shown in both personal terms and as one of the main instigators of the Northern Empire (of Japan). Episode 7 of Night Raid 1931 was streamed exclusively online due to the controversy of the Mukden Incident. It depicts the point of view of the Japanese in Manchuria during the events leading up to the Mukden Incident. It revolves around two young newspaper reporters who are riding on the South Manchuria Railway and run into Kanji Ishiwara, the Lieutenant Colonel of the Kwantung Army who helped devise the bombing so that Japan could attack Manchuria out of \\"self-defence\\". Other key historical figures are also present such as Seishir≈ç Itagaki and Yoshitsugu Tatekawa.

He was instrumental in the creation and consolidation of the New Zealand National Party, which was to dominate New Zealand politics for much of the second half of the 20th century. Holland was elected to parliament in , and became the second Leader of the National Party, and Leader of the Opposition, in 1940. He served briefly (1942) in a war cabinet but thereafter attacked the Labour government for its interventionist economic policies. Holland led the National Party to its first election victory in . His National government implemented moderate economic reforms, dismantling many state controls. Holland's government also undertook constitutional change in 1950, by abolishing the Legislative Council, the upper house of parliament, on the grounds that it was ineffectual. In 1951, Holland, having confronted locked out dockers and coal miners intent on what he called \\"industrial anarchy\\", called a snap election and was re-elected Prime Minister. In its second term, the National government signed the ANZUS defence agreement with Australia and the United States. Holland led his party to a third consecutive victory in 1954. Following ill health in 1957, Holland stepped down as Prime Minister to be replaced by Keith Holyoake. Early life Sidney Holland was born in Greendale in the Canterbury region of the South Island, the youngest child and fourth son of a family of eight children. His father, Henry Holland, was a farmer and merchant, who served as Mayor of Christchurch between 1912 and 1919 and became the Reform Party MP for Christchurch North between 1925 and 1935. During the First World War, Holland enlisted as a territorial in the New Zealand Army in 1915 and later rose to the rank of second lieutenant. He saw action during the Battle of Messines before being invalided home after contracted a severe illness. Due to his injuries, Holland was hospitalised for six months and lost a lung.Nina Templeton, \\"A Coming Man\\", pp.1‚Äì2. Holland was a prominent sportsman and sports administrator, representing Canterbury at provincial and inter-island level in hockey. After retiring from playing, he managed the New Zealand representative hockey team on an unbeaten tour of Australia in the 1932 and was a prominent hockey referee. After the war, Holland and one of his brothers established the Midland Engineering Company in Christchurch, which manufactured horticultural spray pumps and operated a profit-sharing scheme with its employees. Holland later married Florence Drayton in 1920 and the couple raised a family of two boys and two girls. According to his biographer Barry Gustafson, Holland was raised as a Methodist but later became an Anglican.Nina Templeton, \\"A Coming Man\\", pp.2‚Äì3. Early political career Holland in 1935 Following his father Henry Holland's election to the New Zealand Parliament in 1925, Sidney served as his father's unofficial private secretary and campaign manager between 1925 and 1935. Due to this experience, Holland gained an intimate knowledge and interest in parliamentary politics. During the Great Depression, Holland also became the President of both the Canterbury Employers' Association and the Christchurch Businessmen's Club, which brought into contact with the conservative New Zealand Legion and the short-lived Democrat Party, which opposed the Forbes‚ÄìGordon Coates United- Reform coalition Government. As a result of his political experiences, Holland developed a distaste for Communism.Nina Templeton, \\"A Coming Man\\", pp.3‚Äì4. After his father Henry was incapacitated in a serious accident, the older Holland and encouraged Sidney to take his place as the Reform Party candidate for Christchurch North during the 1935 general elections. Holland successfully retained the Christchurch North seat despite the Labour Party's landslide victory during that election. The new Michael Joseph Savage‚ÄìPeter Fraser Labour Government, which ushered in a raft of social and economic reforms including the establishment of a Keynesian welfare state, nationalization of key economic resources, and the expansion of public works and state-housing projects. In response to Labour's electoral success, the Reform and United Parties merged in 1936 to form the National Party, which represented the farming and growing manufacturing sectors of New Zealand society.Nina Templeton, \\"A Coming Man,\\" pp 4, 7. Leader of the Opposition: 1940‚Äì1949 In 1940, Holland replaced National's first non-interim leader Adam Hamilton as the leader of the National Party. Prior to becoming the Party's leader, he had served as Hamilton's parliamentary secretary.Nina Templeton, \\"A Coming Man\\", pp. 9‚Äì15. As leader of the National Party, Holland sought to win the support of the party's farming constituency by establishing a farm in North Canterbury and breeding Romney sheep and Aberdeen Angus cattle. In addition, he also countered other rival conservative parties like the Liberal Party, the Soldier's Movement, and the People's Movement by co-opting them into the National Party in 1941. This merger helped strengthen National's support base by unifying opposition to the Labour Party. Holland served as Leader of the Opposition for nearly ten years until the National Party won the 1949 general election. He represented the Christchurch North electorate from 1935 to 1946, and then the Fendalton electorate from 1946 to 1957.Barry Gustafson, The First 50 Years, pp. 40‚Äì56. Following Japan's entry into the Second World War in 1941, the Labour Government reluctantly acquiesced to the establishment of a bipartisan War Administration in July 1942, consisting of seven Labour Ministers and six National Ministers. Sidney Holland served as the Deputy Chairman of the short-lived War Cabinet, which collapsed in September 1942 after the National Party objected to Labour's handling of an unofficial miners' strike in the Waikato region that same month. Holland's decision strained relations with both the Labour Government and several National MPs including Gordon Coates and Adam Hamilton, who withdrew from the National caucus and rejoined the War Cabinet as independents. The resignation of these two former Reform Party MPs helped strengthen Holland's control over the party caucus and organization.Barry Gustafson, The First 50 Years, pp. 44‚Äì47.Nina Templeton, \\"A Coming Man\\", pp. 17‚Äì31. During the 1943 and 1946 general elections, National slowly eroded Labour's parliamentary majority. While the Labour Party still remained in power, it was forced to contend with a more vigorous opposition National Party. Under Holland's leadership, National repeatedly attacked the Labour Party's socialism, \\"big government\\" bureaucracy, collectivism, and the power of the trade unions. Some important policies propagated by the National Party included individual freedom, a free market, minimum bureaucratic intervention, restriction and regulation, and an acceptance of the welfare state. During the successful 1949 general election, Holland capitalized on the threat of Communist expansion in Eastern Europe, the government's perceived unwillingness to counter the militant waterfront unions, persisting wartime restrictions, and rising inflation. This strategy secured National's electoral victory on 30 November 1949.Barry Gustafson, The First 50 Years, pp. 40, 47‚Äì56. Prime Minister, 1949‚Äì1957 Holland in 1951 =First term, 1949‚Äì1951= The Sidney Holland National Government implemented economic reforms, dismantling many state controls including butter and petrol rationing. His government also emphasized individualism, personal freedom, and private enterprise in accordance with its 1949 electoral platform. One of Holland's first acts as Prime Minister was to abolish the Legislative Council, the upper house of the country's Parliament on 1 December 1950. As a result, the New Zealand Parliament became a unicameral body consisting solely of the House of Representatives. Besides serving as Prime Minister, Holland also served as the Minister of Finance.Barry Gustafson, The First 50 Years, pp. 56‚Äì59. However, Holland did not carry on with his Party's promise to abolish compulsory unionism, which Labour had introduced in 1936. Due to opposition from several trade unions, the government compromised by simply passing a law forcing unions to obtain majority support in a vote before the union could make donations to the opposition Labour Party, which was traditionally associated with the trade unions.Barry Gustafson, The First 50 Years, p.59. In 1950, the National Government reinstated the death penalty, which had been phased out by the previous Labour Government in 1935 and abolished for murder in 1941. Another eight executions were carried out through Holland's administration (out of 36 murder convictions, 22 of whom had resulted in a death sentence). To solve the partisan-infected issue Holland called for a referendum to be held on the same day as the general election of 1957, but the proposal failed to make the ballot. No executions were carried out under Holland's successor, Keith Holyoake, and in 1961 Holyoake oversaw a vote in which Parliament voted 41‚Äì30 (with eleven National MPs crossing the floor) to abolish capital punishment for murder. In 1951, Prime Minister Sidney Holland faced a major challenge from the militant Waterside Workers' Union during the 1951 waterfront dispute (13 February ‚Äì 11 July 1951). The 1951 waterfront dispute was sparked by the refusal of shipowners to give a 15 per cent wage rise to the watersiders who proceeded to ban overtime work. The shipowners retaliated by imposing a lock-out on striking workers. When the watersiders refused to accept arbitration, the National Government imposed emergency regulations under the 1932 Public Safety Conversation Act which drastically curtailed civic liberties, including the freedom of speech and expression. The Regulations were designed to silence and criminalise any support for the watersiders, including food supplies for their families, and pro-watersider publications. In addition, Holland ordered the armed forces to unload cargo from ports and deregistered the Waterside Union and seized its funds. After 151 days, the watersiders capitulated.Barry Gustafson, The First 50 Years, pp. 60.Redmer Yska, \\"Chapter 2: Spies, Lies and Red Herrings,\\" in The Big Blue: Snapshots of the 1951 Watefront Lockout, pp.24‚Äì25. The National Government's actions were popular with the public and press. The opposition Labour Party and the Federation of Labour, the national trade union-governing body, also acquiesced to the government's tough stance on the watersiders due to their acrimonious relationship with the Waterside Union. After the Labour opposition criticized the government's policy, Holland called a snap election on 11 July 1951. The National Party was re-elected with an increased majority, with the backing of a largely conservative Press and the state-controlled radio broadcasters. According to former journalist and historian Redmer Yska, Prime Minister Holland and his government exploited anti-Communist sentiment during the waterfront dispute. Due to the Cold War atmosphere emerging in New Zealand, Holland was able to depict the watersiders as part of the \\"Red Peril\\" that was threatening Western democracy. According to the historian Barry Gustafson, the 1949 and 1951 elections marked the peak of Sidney Holland's political career.Barry Gustafson, The First 50 Years, pp. 60‚Äì62. =Second term, 1951‚Äì1954= After 1951 the National Government continued its policy of deregulating the economy by ending rationing on basic food commodities, loosening import controls, and encouraging home ownership by selling states houses to their tenants. Shortly after being re-elected, the government also enacted the Police Offences Bill which gave the police substantial powers to deal with future industrial unrest. Holland's Government also reformed the superannuation scheme to enable retiring public servants to claim a portion of their entitlement as a lump sum payment. In addition, the Government established producer-controlled agricultural boards. Despite its center-right orientation, the National Government maintained the previous Labour Government's policies of full employment and the welfare state. While the 1950s was a boom time for New Zealand and other Western economies, inflation remained a problem.Barry Gustafson, The First 50 Years, p.65.Redmer Yska, \\"Chapter 2: Spies, Lies, and Red Herrings,\\" p.24. On the foreign policy front, the National Government embedded New Zealand in a series of Western Cold War security alliances and defence agreements. In September 1951, the government signed the ANZUS defence agreement with Australia and the United States. As a member of the Western alliance, the National Government also sent New Zealand troops to the Korean War. A demand for woollen clothing during the conflict created a brief economic boom for New Zealand's sheep farmers.Barry Gustafson, The First 50 Years, p.66. In September 1954, New Zealand ratified the Manila Pact and joined the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization, an American-sponsored regional collective defense organization aimed at combating the spread of Communism in Southeast Asia.David McIntyre, Background to the ANZUS Pact, pp.383‚Äì385. Later, in January 1955, New Zealand's traditional ties to Britain and a fear of the Communist domino effect led Prime Minister Holland to contribute New Zealand troops to the Malayan Emergency.Sidney Holland, \\"Conference of Commonwealth Prime Ministers, Broadcast by Prime Minister\\", 18 January 1955, External Affairs Review V, nos. 1 and 2 (January and February 1955), pp. 2‚Äì4. According to the historian David McIntyre, Holland had little interest in foreign affairs and was the first Prime Minister to delegate that portfolio to another cabinet minister.David McIntyre, Background to the ANZUS Pact, pp.6‚Äì8. During the Holland era, New Zealand had three foreign ministers: Frederick Doidge, Clifton Webb, and Tom Macdonald. At the 1954 general election, National's support declined, due to public dissatisfaction with the rising cost of living and housing. Altogether the party's vote dropped by nearly 100,000 from the 1951 electoral figure. The National Party also had to contend (as it had not needed to do in 1951) with a new third party: the Social Credit Political League, which won 122,573 votes. In addition, the Labour Party polled more votes than National but failed to reduce National's numerical majority in Parliament; the country's First-past-the-post voting system enabled it to maintain a majority of 10 electorate seats. Besides, Gustafson suggests that the appearance of Social Credit split the opposition vote. During the electoral campaign, in what was to be a portent of his 1956-57 troubles, Holland's health deteriorated markedly. He kept losing his voice, forcing him to limit his speeches to half an hour. Following the 1954 election, the National Government set up a royal commission to examine the country's monetary system. This commission released a report condemning Social Credit theories.Barry Gustafson, The First 50 Years, pp. 66‚Äì67. =Third term, 1954‚Äì1957= Holland and other Cabinet ministers with the Governor-General, Sir Willoughby Norrie, at Government House, 27 November 1954 Once the National Government had been assured of a third consecutive term, Holland gave up the finance portfolio to Jack Watts, the former Minister of Industries and Commerce. With the loss of one National MP (W.F. Fortune) and the retirement of several older ministers, Holland rejuvenated his Cabinet with several younger men including Dean Eyre, Syd Smith, John McAlpine, Tom Shand, Geoff Gerard, and Eric Halstead. In 1955 the annual terminal income tax assessment system was phased out in favor of a Pay As You Earn (PAYE) system. Also, the Tourist Hotel Corporation was established with Holland's strong support and against the opposition of Holyoake (by this time Deputy Prime Minister), who feared that tourism would divert investment away from agriculture. After Dean Eyre went on a private overseas business trip in 1956, Holland introduced a code of ethics that banned any conflict of interest between a minister's public duty and private affairs.Barry Gustafson, The First 50 Years, pp. 68‚Äì69. During Holland's last years in office, New Zealand also faced a serious balance of payments crisis that had been precipitated by a rapid decline in overseas demand for the country's butter, wool, and cheese exports. In addition, Holland's health was proving less and less able to withstand the strain of his duties, and his memory sometimes failed him. Amid the Suez Crisis in October 1956, Holland suffered a mild heart attack or stroke (accounts vary) while working in his office. However, far from retreating to bed, he insisted on remaining at the office for the next 48 hours until the crisis was resolved. According to his biographer Gustafson, Holland's physique never fully recovered from that incident. During the Suez Crisis, New Zealand and Australia were among the few countries to defend the Anglo-French invasion of the Suez Canal. Despite his conspicuous medical problems, Holland was initially reluctant to hand over the Party's leadership to his deputy, Holyoake.Barry Gustafson, The First 50 Years, pp. 69‚Äì70. But following a meeting the following year with several senior National Party officials including Holyoake himself, John Marshall, Jack Watts, and the Party's President Alex McKenzie, Holland reluctantly agreed to resign as Prime Minister and Leader of the Party. On 12 August 1957, Holland announced his retirement at the National Party's annual conference in Wellington. Once he had made that announcement, he became so obviously sick that he had to be helped back to his hotel, where a doctor was called. The following day, Holyoake was formally named Holland's successor. Holland handed over the Prime Ministry to Holyoake on 20 September. Shortly afterwards, on 23 September, he was appointed a Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the Bath. He remained in Cabinet, as minister without portfolio; but he left the legislature for good at the 1957 general election, in which Holyoake went down to defeat, and which saw the advent of a second Labour Government under Walter Nash.Barry Gustafson, The First 50 Years, pp. 71‚Äì72. Later life and death Following his departure from parliament, Holland suffered continual ill health. He died in Wellington Hospital in 1961. Politics ran in the family: his son Eric Holland became a National MP for Fendalton and Riccarton (1967‚Äì81) and a cabinet minister (1975‚Äì78) in Robert Muldoon's first administration.

The Pig War, so called because it was triggered by the shooting of a pig, is also called the Pig Episode, the Pig and Potato War, the San Juan Boundary Dispute and the Northwestern Boundary Dispute. Aside from the death of one pig, this dispute was a bloodless conflict. Background The Oregon Treaty of June 15, 1846, resolved the Oregon boundary dispute by dividing the Oregon Country/Columbia District between the United States and Britain \\"along the forty-ninth parallel of north latitude to the middle of the channel which separates the continent from Vancouver Island, and thence southerly through the middle of the said channel, and of the Strait of Juan de Fuca, to the Pacific Ocean.\\"Oregon Treaty from Wikisource. Visited October 16, 2006. However, there are actually two straits that could be called the middle of the channel: Haro Strait, along the west side of the San Juan Islands; and Rosario Strait, along the east side. In 1846, there was still some uncertainty about the geography of the region. The most commonly available maps were those of George Vancouver, published in 1798, and of Charles Wilkes, published in 1845. In both cases the maps are unclear in the vicinity of the southeastern coast of Vancouver Island and the Gulf Islands. As a result, Haro Strait is not fully clear either. In 1856, the US and Britain set up a Boundary Commission to resolve a number of issues regarding the international boundary, including the water boundary from the Strait of Georgia to the Strait of Juan de Fuca. The British appointed James Charles Prevost First Commissioner, George Henry Richards Second Commissioner, and William A. G. Young Secretary. The US appointed Archibald Campbell First Commissioner, John Parke Second Commissioner, and William J. Warren Secretary. On June 27, 1857, the American and British commissioners met for the first time on board the British ship HMS Satellite, anchored in Esquimalt Harbour. The two sides met several more times in 1857 in Esquimalt Harbour and Nanaimo Harbour, and corresponded by letter between meetings. The water boundary was discussed from October to December. From the start, Prevost maintained that Rosario Strait was required by the treaty's wording and was intended by the treaty framers, while Campbell had the same opinion for Haro Strait. Prevost held that the channel specified in the treaty must have three key qualities: # it must separate the continent from Vancouver Island, # it must carry the boundary in a southerly direction, and # it must be navigable. Only Rosario fulfilled these requirements, he wrote. Campbell countered that the expression \\"southerly\\", in the treaty, was to be understood in a general sense, that Rosario Strait did not separate the continent from Vancouver Island, but the San Juan Islands from Lummi Island, Cypress Island, Fidalgo Island, and others, and that navigability was not germane to the issue, but even if it was, Haro Strait was the wider and more direct passage. Finally he challenged Prevost to produce any evidence showing that the treaty framers had intended Rosario Strait. Prevost responded to the challenge by referring to American maps showing the boundary running through Rosario Strait, included one by John C. Fr√©mont, produced for and published by the US government, and another by John B. Preston, Surveyor General of Oregon in 1852. To the other points, Prevost repeated his statements about Rosario Strait's navigability‚Äîthe channels between Lummi, Cypress, and Fidalgo islands not being navigable‚Äîand that a line through Rosario would be southerly, while one through Haro would have to be drawn westerly. The two continued to discuss the issue into December 1857, until it was clear what each side's argument was and that neither would be convinced of the other. Prevost made a final offer at the sixth meeting, December 3. He suggested a compromise line through San Juan Channel, which would give the US all the main islands except San Juan Island. This offer was rejected and the commission adjourned, agreeing to report back to their respective governments. Thus ambiguity over the water boundary remained. Because of this ambiguity, both the United States and Britain claimed sovereignty over the San Juan Islands. During this period of disputed sovereignty, Britain's Hudson's Bay Company established operations on San Juan and turned the island into a sheep ranch. Meanwhile, by mid-1859, twenty-five to twenty-nine American settlers had arrived.British Columbia: From the earliest times to the present, Vol II by E.O.S. Scholefield and F.W. Howay San Juan Island held significance not for its size, but as a military strategic point. While the British held Fort Victoria on Vancouver Island to the west, overlooking the Strait of Juan de Fuca, the entry point to Haro Strait, leading to the Strait of Georgia, the nation that held the San Juan Islands would be able to dominate all the straits connecting the Strait of Juan de Fuca with the Strait of Georgia. General George B. McClellan, George Pickett‚Äôs West Point Classmate and lifelong friend, claimed that General William S. Harney and Pickett conspired with a cabal, to start a war with Britain, creating a common enemy, to head off a north‚Äìsouth confrontation. However, General Granville O. Haller debunked McClellan's theory. He said they had wanted to start a war, but with hope of distracting the north so that the south could gain independence. The theories are given credence when it is noted that Major General Silas Casey, then a Lieutenant Colonel and deputy commander of the 9th Infantry Division, was reduced to a support role for Captain George Pickett who was given independent jurisdiction over a vast area by Harney, then a Brevet Major, and was also passed over by Harney in favor of Pickett when given this choice command. On the other hand, it can be said that Lt Col Casey had not been reduced, for he was given command over the USS Massachusetts and Major Haller to protect and supervise the water of Puget Sound. He was given discretion to deviate from his orders, based on his military experience. (His textbook on infantry tactics was used at West Point during the Civil War.) Pig On June 15, 1859, exactly thirteen years after the adoption of the Oregon Treaty, the ambiguity led to direct conflict. Lyman Cutlar, an American farmer who had moved onto San Juan Island claiming rights to live there under the Donation Land Claim Act, found a Large Black pig rooting in his garden. He had found the pig eating his tubers. This was not the first occurrence. Cutlar was so upset that he took aim and shot the pig, killing it. It turned out that the pig was owned by an Irishman, Charles Griffin, who was employed by the Hudson's Bay Company to run the sheep ranch. He also owned several pigs that he allowed to roam freely. The two had lived in peace until this incident. Cutlar offered $10 () to Griffin to compensate for the pig, but Griffin was unsatisfied with this offer and demanded $100 (). Following this reply, Cutlar believed he should not have to pay for the pig because the pig had been trespassing on his land. One likely apocryphal account has Cutlar saying to Griffin, \\"It was eating my potatoes\\"; and Griffin replying, \\"It is up to you to keep your potatoes out of my pig.\\" When British authorities threatened to arrest Cutlar, American settlers called for military protection.

Harney, commanding the Department of Oregon, initially dispatched Captain George Pickett and 66 American soldiers of the 9th Infantry Regiment under Pickett's command, to San Juan Island with orders to prevent the British from landing; the regiment sailed aboard . Concerned that a squatter population of Americans would begin to occupy San Juan Island if the Americans were not kept in check, the British sent three warships under the command of Captain Geoffrey Hornby to counter the Americans. Pickett was quoted as saying defiantly, \\"We'll make a Bunker Hill of it,\\" placing him in the national limelight. Pickett sited his company and battery near the Hudson's Bay Company's Belle Vue sheep farm located near today's Cattle Point Light, and directly under the guns of HMS Satellite, a British ship. When this tactical error was pointed out, Capt Pickett moved his battery of cannon a few miles north to high ground overlooking both Griffin Bay and the Strait of Juan de Fuca, and commenced to build a redoubt for his cannon.

Robert's Redoubt is considered the best-preserved fortification of its kind in the United States. (To the east is Jackle's Lagoon, named for George Jackle, a soldier stationed at the American Camp.) The situation continued to escalate. By August 10, 1859, 461 Americans with 14 cannons under Colonel Silas Casey were opposed by five British warships mounting 70 guns and carrying 2,140 men. The governor of the Colony of Vancouver Island, James Douglas, ordered British Rear Admiral Robert L. Baynes to land marines on San Juan Island and engage the American soldiers under the command of Brigadier-General Harney. (Harney's forces had occupied the island since July 27, 1859.) Baynes refused, deciding that \\"two great nations in a war over a squabble about a pig\\" was foolish. Local commanding officers on both sides had been given essentially the same orders: defend yourselves, but absolutely do not fire the first shot. For several days, the British and U.S. soldiers exchanged insults, each side attempting to goad the other into firing the first shot, but discipline held on both sides, and thus no shots were fired. Resolution When news about the crisis reached Washington and London, officials from both nations were shocked and took action to calm the potentially explosive international incident. In September, U.S. President James Buchanan sent General Winfield Scott to negotiate with Governor Douglas and resolve the growing crisis. This was in the best interest of the United States, as sectional tensions within the country were increasing, soon to culminate in the Civil War. Scott had calmed two other border crises between the two nations in the late 1830s. He arrived in the San Juans in October and began negotiations with Douglas. As a result of the negotiations, both sides agreed to retain joint military occupation of the island until a final settlement could be reached, reducing their presence to a token force of no more than 100 men. The \\"English Camp\\" was established on the north end of San Juan Island along the shoreline, for ease of supply and access; and the \\"American Camp\\" was created on the south end on a high, windswept meadow, suitable for artillery barrages against shipping. Today the Union Jack still flies above the \\"English Camp\\", being raised and lowered daily by park rangers, making it one of the few places without diplomatic status where U.S. government employees regularly hoist the flag of another country, though this is only for commemorative purposes. Union Jack at the \\"English Camp\\" in San Juan Island National Historical Park During the years of joint military occupation, the small British and American units on San Juan Island had an amicable mutual social life, visiting one another's camps to celebrate their respective national holidays and holding various athletic competitions. Park rangers tell visitors the biggest threat to peace on the island during these years was \\"the large amounts of alcohol available\\". This state of affairs continued for the next 12 years. The dispute was peacefully resolved after more than a decade of confrontation and military bluster, during which time the local British authorities consistently lobbied London to seize back the Puget Sound region entirely, as the Americans were busy elsewhere with the Civil War. In 1866, the Colony of Vancouver Island was merged with the Colony of British Columbia to form an enlarged Colony of British Columbia. In 1871, the enlarged colony joined the newly formed Dominion of Canada. That year, the United Kingdom and the United States signed the Treaty of Washington, which dealt with various differences between the two nations, including border issues involving the newly formed Dominion. Among the results of the treaty was the decision to resolve the San Juan dispute by international arbitration, with German Emperor Wilhelm I chosen to act as arbitrator. Wilhelm referred the issue to a three-man arbitration commission which met in Geneva for nearly a year. On October 21, 1872, the commission decided in favor of the United States. The arbitrator chose the American- preferred marine boundary via Haro Strait, to the west of the islands, over the British preference for Rosario Strait which lay to their east. British troops evacuate San Juan Island On November 25, 1872, the British withdrew their Royal Marines from the British Camp. The Americans followed by July 1874.

Brant Parker co-produced and illustrated The Wizard of Id. Hart was recognized with several awards, including the Swedish Adamson Award and five from the National Cartoonists Society. In his later years, he was criticized for incorporating Christian themes and messages into his strips. Hart was referred to as \\"the most widely read Christian of our time,\\" over C. S. Lewis, Frank E. Peretti, and Billy Graham, by Chuck Colson in a Breakpoint column. Biography Born in Endicott, New York, Hart's first published work was in Stars and Stripes while he served in Korea as an enlisted member of the United States Air Force. Returning in 1953, he published cartoons in The Saturday Evening Post, Collier's Weekly and other magazines. His pre-cartooning employment included working in a barbecue restaurant and sign painting.The Johnny Hart Interview, 1995 Hart's biggest success, B.C., was created in 1957 and began appearing in national daily newspapers on February 17, 1958. Hart also co-created and wrote the comic strip The Wizard of Id, drawn by Brant Parker, which has been distributed since November 9, 1964. Hart died of a stroke on April 7, 2007. According to his wife, he was working at his drawing table at the time of his death.BC cartoonist dies while drawing, BBC News His co-creator for The Wizard of Id, Brant Parker, died just eight days later, on April 15, 2007. =Religious convictions= Hart was raised in a casually religious family, and he attended Christian Sunday School regularly. Although his formal education ended with high school, he was fascinated by the Bible from a young age. In 1984 there was a distinguishable shift in Hart's spirituality, and Hart and wife Bobby began attending a congregation of the Presbyterian Church in Nineveh, New York. Hart attributed his religious awakening to a father-son team of contractors who installed a satellite dish at his home. Hart's increasingly deep religious faith, and the staunch theological and political conservatism that accompanied it, came to be the source of considerable controversy in the later years of his life. In a 1999 interview with The Washington Post, for example, he stated that \\"Jews and Muslims who don't accept Jesus will burn in Hell\\" and that \\"homosexuality is the handiwork of Satan.\\" In the same piece, Hart opined that \\"the end of the world is approaching, maybe by the year 2010.\\" The lion's share of controversy, however, came from Hart's increasing tendency to incorporate his religious and political themes and ideals into his comic strips, especially B.C. Some newspapers refused to print strips with overtly religious themes or, as with the Los Angeles Times, moved them to the religious section of the newspaper. =Controversial strips= Two strips in particular were controversial. The B.C. strip for April 15, 2001, which was Easter, portrayed a Jewish menorah with seven candles progressively burning out as the strip captions ran the words of Jesus Christ. At the end, the outer arms of the candelabrum broke away, leaving a Christian cross, with the final panel portraying the opened and empty tomb of Christ. Critics including the Anti-Defamation League and the American Jewish Committee argued that Hart's strip portrayed replacement theology, that is, the conception of Christianity as supplanting Judaism. Hart offered an apology \\"if I have offended any readers,\\" but still thought the strip could increase \\"religious awareness\\" and claimed that he had meant the strip to be a tribute to both religions. Another B.C. strip, which ran November 10, 2003, showed an outhouse with a traditional crescent, which a character entered with a vertical graphic \\"SLAM\\", only to ask, \\"Is it just me, or does it stink in here?\\" Critics including the Council on American-Islamic Relations claimed that the combination of the vertical bar and the \\"SLAM\\", as well as the crescent moons both in the sky and on the outhouse, made the strip a slur on Islam. Hart denied that it was anything but an outhouse joke. According to Hanna-Barbera animator Ed Benedict, the animation powerhouses approached Hart in 1960 pitching a prime time animated B.C. series. Talks fell through with HB retooling the concept into what eventually became The Flintstones. Personal life Hart was an active member of his local community ‚Äî the area of Greater Binghamton in Broome County, New York, which shares a common abbreviation of \\"B.C.\\" Hart donated B.C.-based drawings and logos free of charge to many entities and organizations found in the Broome County area, including logos for: * B.C.

Open dated back to the early 1970s, and characters from B.C. were used extensively in advertising and marketing materials for the event, including the winner's trophy, which was a bronzed version of a hapless B.C. Caveman golfing, a light-hearted trophy when compared to many others, leading it to have earned the designation of being \\"voted by the players on Tour as the best trophy on Tour; the one that they would love to have.\\" Additionally, Hart contributed original panels of B.C. strips for charity auctions with the Binghamton, New York-based PBS affiliate, WSKG-TV. He also provided album cover art for the 1999 album Still Fresh by the world-famous jazz vocal group The Four Freshmen, and his strips for B.C. were the inspiration for the mascot of UC Irvine, the anteater. Tribute Hart was memorialized in a May 14, 2007, strip of the comic strip Mother Goose & Grimm. In the June 20, 2007, Blondie strip, the last panel shows Mr. Dithers saying, \\"Boy oh boy, that Johnny Hart sure knew his stuff, didn't he?\\" Bruce Tinsley honored Hart in his Mallard Fillmore strip of July 10, 2007.

Though produced for a beginning film class, the short had a very long life at animation festivals, launching Hertzfeldt into cult status at a young age. In 1998, the short won the Grand Prize Award for \\"World's Funniest Cartoon\\" from the HBO U.S. Comedy Arts Festival. The cartoon is a self-parody, told from the point of view of a \\"bitter filmmaker\\". In it, a crudely drawn male suitor is subjected to exaggerated bloody violence from all the unreasonably emotional and psychotic women he approaches, with each vignette closing as the paper physically crumples up the characters in a frustrated heap. The soundtrack is entirely guitar music, performed by Hertzfeldt on a boom box in his dorm room.  On DVD  In 2005, the original 16mm negative was digitally restored and remastered for the first time, for release on the extensive \\"Bitter Films Volume 1\\" DVD compilation of Hertzfeldt's 1995-2005 films. For the DVD, Hertzfeldt performed an alternate guitar soundtrack as a special feature, approximately 10 years after recording the original. Other special features for Ah L'Amour include Don's original production sketches and notes, as well as a very rare 1993 video short that Don created in high school, that is a direct precursor to the film.

A freemartin or free-martin (sometimes martin heifer) is an infertile female mammal with masculinized behavior and non-functioning ovaries. Genetically the animal is chimeric: Karyotyping of a sample of cells shows XX/XY chromosomes. The animal originates as a female (XX), but acquires the male (XY) component in utero by exchange of some cellular material from a male twin, via vascular connections between placentas: an example of microchimerism.In utero cell transfer between porcine littermates, in Reproduction, Fertility, and Development (2011; 23(2): 297‚Äì302. - doi: 10.1071/RD10165) Externally, the animal appears female, but various aspects of female reproductive development are altered due to acquisition of anti-M√ºllerian hormone from the male twin. Freemartinism is the normal outcome of mixed-sex twins in all cattle species that have been studied, and it also occurs occasionally in other mammals including sheep, goats and pigs.  History  Freemartins are known to have been described by the Roman writer Varro, who called them \\"taura\\".EARLY RECOGNITION OF THE FREEMARTIN CONDITION IN HEIFERS TWINBORN WITH BULLS, by W.W. Swett, C.A. Matthews, and R. R. Graves, in the Journal of Agricultural Research, vol. 61, no. 8 (October 15, 1940) The 18th-century physician John Hunter discovered that a freemartin always has a male twin. It was hypothesized early in the 20th century that masculinizing factors travel from the male twin to the female twin through the vascular connections of the placenta because of the vascular fusion and affect the internal anatomy of the female.(Nelson, Randy. An introduction to behavioral endocrinology. Sinauer Associates: Massachusetts. 2005: pg 145) Several researchers made the discovery that a freemartin results when a female fetus has its chorion fuse in the uterus with that of a male twin. The result was published in 1916 by Tandler and Keller.Keller, K. and Tandler, J.: Wiener Tieraztl. Wochensch., 3, 513-526 (1916). The discovery was made independently by American biologist Frank R. Lillie, who published it in Science in 1916. Both teams are now credited with the discovery. In rural areas folklore often claimed this condition was not just peculiar to cattle, but extended also to human twins; this belief perpetuated for generations, as was mentioned in the writings of Bede.de Albuquerque, Martim Notes and Queries Volume 2. 1857 by Oxford University Press, p. 149 =Etymology= The etymology of the term \\"freemartin\\" is uncertain: speculations include that \\"free\\" may indicate \\"willing\\" (referring to the freemartin's willingness to work) or \\"exempt from reproduction\\" (referring to its sterility, or to a farmer's decision to not bother trying to breed a freemartin, or both), or that it may be derived from a Flemish word for a cow which gives no milk and/or has ceased to be capable of bearing offspring; \\"martin\\" is generally held to derive from an Irish or Gaelic word for \\"cow\\" or \\"heifer\\", although connections to Martinmas have also been posited. Mechanism In most cattle twins, the blood vessels in the chorions become interconnected, creating a shared circulation for both twins. If both fetuses are the same sex this is of no significance, but if they are different, male hormones pass from the male twin to the female twin. The male hormones (testosterone and anti-M√ºllerian hormone) then masculinize the female twin, and the result is a freemartin. The degree of masculinization is greater if the fusion occurs earlier in the pregnancy - in about ten percent of cases no fusion takes place and the female remains fertile. The male twin is largely unaffected by the fusion, although the size of the testicles may be slightly reduced. Testicle size is associated with fertility, so there may be some reduction in bull fertility. Freemartins behave and grow in a similar way to castrated male cattle (steers). Diagnosis If suspected, a test can be done to detect the presence of the male Y-chromosomes in some circulating white blood cells of the subject. Genetic testing for the Y-chromosome can be performed within days of birth and can aid in the early identification of a sterile female bovine. Physical examination of the calf may also reveal differences: a subjective assessment is that frequently there is a tuft of hair at the ventral tip of the vulva in a freemartin heifer atypical in fertile heifer calves. Also, often many (but not all) freemartins will have a shortened length of vagina compared with that of a fertile heifer. Commercial probes are available to check heifers for obvious freemartinism in lieu of doing a blood test Other animals A freemartin is the normal outcome of mixed twins in all cattle species which have been studied. It does not normally occur in most other mammals, though it has been recorded in sheep, goats, and pigs. Uses Freemartins are occasionally used in stem cell and immunology research. During fetal development cells are exchanged between the fused circulations of the bovine twins. Up to 95% of the freemartin's blood cells can be derived from those of her twin brother. Male-derived cells and their progeny can be easily visualized in the freemartin tissues, as only they contain the male Y chromosome. Thus, by analyzing these tissues, one can investigate the capacity of hematopoietic stem cells or other circulating cells to produce other tissues in addition to blood. The freemartin model allows one to analyze perfectly healthy and unmanipulated animals, without resorting to transplantation often used in stem cell research. Fictional use * In the Aldous Huxley novel Brave New World, a \\"freemartin\\" (mentioned in chapters 1, 3, 11 and 17) is a woman who has been deliberately made sterile by exposure to hormones during fetal development; in the book, government policy requires freemartins to comprise 70% of the female population. * The Robert A. Heinlein novel Beyond This Horizon lists \\"the clever and repulsively beautiful pseudo-feminine freemartins\\" as one of the genetically-engineered specialist types of humans that were created in the \\"Empire of the Great Khans\\" (chapter 2). *In the Robert Heinlein novel Farnham's Freehold, the protagonist, Hugh Farnham, is given a companion (bedwarmer) that is described as a natural freemartin. *In the Avram Davidson story \\"The House the Blakeneys Built\\", the cattle are freemartins. *In the fantasy book series Bazil Broketail by Christopher Rowley, \\"freemartin\\" is the name for a breed of sterile female dragons. *In Footfall by Larry Niven and Jerry Pournelle, a lithely built human woman uses the term \\"freemartin\\" to describe herself, while doubting her sexuality. *In Nicola Griffith's novel Hild, the title character is sometimes referred to by others as a freemartin, in reference to her non-feminine character and social role.

Founded in 1897, Zhejiang University is one of China's oldest, most selective, and most prestigious institutions of higher education. The university is organized into 37 colleges, schools, and departments offering more than 140 undergraduate and 300 graduate programs. The university is also a Chinese Ministry of Education Class A Double First Class University and is an active member of the Yangtze Delta Universities Alliance, the Association of Pacific Rim Universities, the Worldwide Universities Network, the International Association of Universities, and the Global University Network for Innovation. The university possesses a faculty of more than 3,741 scholars, including 45 members from the Chinese Academy of Sciences and the Chinese Academy of Engineering, 10 Liberal Arts and Humanities Senior Professors (ÊñáÁßëËµÑÊ∑±ÊïôÊéà), 121 Chang Jiang Scholars Program Professors, and 133 recipients of the National Science Fund for Distinguished Young Scholars. Zhejiang University maintains 5 academic libraries. The library collection in its entirety contains more than 7.7 million volumes, making it one of China's largest academic collections.Libraries in China The university also includes 7 affiliated hospitals, 1 museum, 2 international joint institutes, and boasts over 150 student organizations. History Lin Qi, the founder of ZJU =Qing Dynasty= In 1897, then-mayor of Hangzhou, Lin Qi () established the \\"Qiushi Academy/Ch'iu Shih Academy\\" (). Lin studied the Western higher education system and applied it to the Qiushi Academy. The Ch'iu-shih Academy was renamed to Chekiang College () in 1902, and to Chekiang Higher Institutes in 1903. A second institution that factored into the early history of Zhejiang University was Yuying Xuetang (Yuying School or Yuying College), established in 1902. This was renamed to Yuying Yishu (Yuying Public School), and then to Yuying Academy. In 1911, Yuying Academy became Zhijiang Xuetang (Zhijiang College) and moved to Qinwang Hill (), outside of Hangzhou. =1912‚Äì1937= In 1912, Zhejiang Medical School was established, later developing into Zhejiang Provincial Medical College and becoming part of Zhejiang University. In 1927, some schools and colleges (e.g. industrial and agricultural colleges/schools) were merged into the Qiushi Academy. Then the name of the enlarged school was changed to \\"National Third Sun Zhongshan University\\" (or, National Third Sun Yat-sen University), after Sun Yat-sen. On April 1, 1928, it was renamed \\"Che Kiang University\\" (now Zhejiang University from the pinyin name), and in the same year, \\"National\\" was added and it became \\"National Che Kiang University\\" (). =War period, 1937‚Äì1949= Scientists working at ZJU during the war In the latter half of 1937, the Second Sino-Japanese War broke out, and due to the invading Imperial Japanese Army, the university evacuated from Hangzhou to Guizhou until 1946, after the war ended. Reputed as \\"Cambridge of the East\\" by Joseph Needham (twice visited ZJU in 1944) in China's modern history of higher education, National Che Kiang University's was consistently ranked as among top 3 in the nation during that time. During this period, the National Che Kiang University was praised as one of the Four most Prominent Universities in the Republic China (), along with National Central University, National Southwestern Associated University, and National Wuhan University. =1952‚Äì1998= Zhejiang University was split up into a number of single- discipline colleges during the 1952 readjustment of China's Tertiary Education System. Its schools of arts and sciences either went to former Hangzhou University or joined with Fudan University. Its medical and pharmaceutical schools formed Zhejiang Medical University. Its agricultural and horticultural schools went to establish Zhejiang Agricultural University. 1952~1953, Its chemical engineering departments, and some the other technological parts went to former Hangzhou Chemical Engineering School (now Zhejiang University of Technology, ZJUT). And the dean Li Shouheng, who was one of the main founders of China's modern chemical engineering, was pointed to be the first president of ZJUT. =After 1998= In 1998, with the approval of the State Council, the new Zhejiang University was established as a combination of four major universities that had grown up in Hangzhou over the previous half-century, namely Zhejiang University, Hangzhou University, Zhejiang Agricultural University and Zhejiang Medical University. On September 21, 2006, Chinese billionaires Duan Yongping (Zhejiang University alumnus) and Ding Lei (Zhejiang native) donated together a one-time endowment of 40 million US dollars to Zhejiang University. US$30 million was from Duan with 10 million from Ding. It was the largest private one-off endowment to a university in Mainland China. A ceremony was held at the newly founded Zijin'gang Campus to receive the donation. Academics Library Hall Medical School Zhejiang University is a comprehensive research university with national and international impact. Research at Zhejiang University spans 12 academic disciplines: agriculture, art, economics, education, engineering, history, law, literature, management, medicine, natural sciences, and philosophy. In the Essential Science Indicator (ESI) rankings of 22 disciplines, Zhejiang University ranks among the top 1% in 15 disciplines and is listed in the top 100 of the world's academic institutions in 4 disciplines. School of Architecture With seven campuses, namely Zijin'gang, Yuquan, Xixi, Huajiachi, Zhijiang, Zhoushan, and the Haining International campus, Zhejiang University encompasses an area of 5.9 square kilometers with school buildings covering 1.94 million square meters of floor space. The university library holds a collection of more than 7.7 million volumes. In addition, Zhejiang University has 7 high-level affiliated hospitals.

Overview Economist Lok Sang Ho in his Public Policy and the Public InterestRoutledge, 2012 (first published in 2011). argues that the public interest must be assessed impartially and, therefore, defines the public interest as the \\"ex ante welfare of the representative individual.\\" Under a thought experiment, by assuming that there is an equal chance for one to be anyone in society and, thus, could benefit or suffer from a change, the public interest is by definition enhanced whenever that change is preferred to the status quo ex ante. This approach is \\"ex ante\\", in the sense that the change is not evaluated after the fact but assessed before the fact without knowing whether one would actually benefit or suffer from it. This approach follows the \\"veil of ignorance\\" approach, which was first proposed by John Harsanyi but popularized by John Rawls in his 1971 Theory of Justice.Rawls, John (1971) A Theory of Justice, Cambridge: Harvard University Press. Historically, however, the approach can be traced to John Stuart Mill, who, in his letter to George Grote, explained that \\"human happiness, even one's own, is in general more successfully pursued by acting on general rules, than by measuring the consequences of each act; and this is still more the case with the general happiness, since any other plan would not only leave everybody uncertain what to expect, but would involve perpetual quarrelling...\\"Francis E. Mineka and Dwight N. Lindley (ed.), The Collected Works of John Stuart Mill, Volume XIV - The Later Letters of John Stuart Mill 1849-1873 Part I, Toronto: University of Toronto Press, London: Routledge and Kegan Paul, 1972, Vol. XV, p. 762, 1862. The Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales argues that applying a detailed definition is likely to result in unintended consequences, in Acting in the Public Interest(2012). Instead, each circumstance needs to be assessed based on criteria such as the relevant public, wants, and constraints. The key to assessing any public interest decision is transparency of the decision-making process, including balancing competing interests. Law Brandeis (center) in his office 1916. ‚ÄúPublic interest law‚Äù is a term that became widely adopted in the United States during and after the social turmoil of the 1960s. It built upon a tradition exemplified by Louis Brandeis, who before becoming a U.S. Supreme Court justice incorporated advocacy for the interests of the general public into his legal practice. In a celebrated 1905 speech, Brandeis decried the legal profession, complaining that ‚Äúable lawyers have to a large extent allowed themselves to become adjuncts of great corporations and have neglected their obligation to use their powers for the protection of the people.‚Äù Edwin Rekosh, et al.,ed. \\"Pursuing the Public Interest, A Handbook for Legal Professionals and Activists\\" (http://www.pilnet.org/component/docman/doc_download/35-pursuing-the-public- interest-a-handbook-for-legal.html); Scott L. Cummings, The Politics of Pro Bono, 52 UCLA L. Rev. 1, 13-14(2004) In the late 1960s and 1970s, large numbers of American law school graduates began to seek ‚Äúrelevance‚Äù in their work ‚Äî wishing to have an effect on the social issues that were so visibly and hotly debated within American society at that time. They defined themselves as public interest lawyers in order to distinguish themselves from the ‚Äúcorporate adjuncts‚Äù referred to by Brandeis.Rekosh, supra; See also Joel F. Handler, Ellen Jane Hollingsworth & Howard S. Erlanger, Lawyers and the Pursuit of Legal Rights 24-39 (1978); Note, The New Public Interest lawyers, 79 Yale L.J. 1069, 1069-70 (1970) Public interest law does not describe a body of law or a legal field; the term was adopted to describe whom the public interest lawyers were representing, rather than what matters they would work on. Instead of representing powerful economic interests, they chose to be advocates for otherwise underrepresented individuals. Consequently, a significant current in public interest lawyering has always emphasized the need to provide legal services to those living in poverty. The term has grown, however, to encompass a broader range of activities of lawyers and non-lawyers working toward a multitude of objectives, including civil rights, civil liberties, women's rights, consumer rights, environmental protection, and so on. Nevertheless, a common denominator for public interest lawyers in the United States and in a growing number of countries remains the ethic of ‚Äúfighting for the little guy‚Äù‚Äîthat is, representing the underrepresented and vulnerable segments of society.Scott L. Cummings & Ingrid V. Eagly, After Public Interest Law, NWU L. Rev. 1251, 1251-1259, 2075-2077(2006) Government Public interest has been considered as the core of \\"democratic theories of government‚Äù and often paired with two other concepts, \\"convenience\\" and \\"necessity\\".Napoli, Philip M. (2001). Foundations of Communications Policy. Principles and Process in the Regulation of Electronic Media. Cresskill, NJ: Hampton Press Public interest, convenience and necessity appeared for the first time in the Transportation Act of 1920 and also appeared in the Radio Act of 1927.

Parliament repealed the Stamp Act because boycotts were hurting British trade and used the declaration to justify the repeal and save face. The declaration stated that the Parliament's authority was the same in America as in Britain and asserted Parliament's authority to pass laws that were binding on the American colonies. Background Representatives from a number of the Thirteen Colonies assembled as the Stamp Act Congress in response to the Stamp Act 1765, to call into question the right of a distant power to tax them without proper representation. The British Parliament was then faced with colonies who refused to comply with their Act. This, combined with protests that had occurred in the colonies and, perhaps more importantly, protests which had arisen in Great Britain from manufacturers who were suffering from the colonies' non-importation agreement, all led to the repeal of the Stamp Act. Normally the economic activity in the colonies would not have caused such an outcry, but the British economy was still experiencing a post-war depression from the Seven Years' War. Another reason for repeal of the Stamp Act was the replacement of George Grenville, the Prime Minister who had enacted the Stamp Acts, by Charles Watson-Wentworth, 2nd Marquess of Rockingham. Rockingham was more favorable towards the colonies and furthermore he was antagonistic towards policies that Grenville had enacted. Rockingham invited Benjamin Franklin to speak to Parliament about colonial policy and he portrayed the colonists as in opposition to internal taxes (which were derived from internal colonial transactions) such as the Stamp Act called for, but not external taxes (which were duties laid on imported commodities). Parliament then agreed to repeal the Stamp Act on the condition that the Declaratory Act was passed. On March 18, 1766, Parliament repealed the Stamp Act and passed the Declaratory Act. The Declaratory Act proclaimed that Parliament \\"had hath, and of right ought to have, full power and authority to make laws and statutes of sufficient force and validity to bind the colonies and people of America ... in all cases whatsoever\\". The phrasing of the act was intentionally unambiguous. In other words, the Declaratory Act of 1766 asserted that Parliament had the absolute power to make laws and changes to the colonial government, \\"in all cases whatsoever\\", even though the colonists were not represented in the Parliament. Reaction Although many in Parliament felt that taxes were implied in this clause, other members of Parliament and many of the colonists‚Äîwho were busy celebrating what they saw as their political victory‚Äîdid not. Other colonists, however, were outraged because the Declaratory Act hinted that more acts would be coming. This Declaratory Act was copied almost word for word from the Irish Declaratory Act, an Act which had placed Ireland in a position of bondage to the crown, implying that the same fate would come to The Thirteen Colonies. However, the colonists never explicitly called for its repeal, and would seek reconciliation with the crown up until the last minute. The political theorist Edward Mims described the American reaction to the Declaratory Act: > When in 1766 this modernised British Parliament, committed by now to the > principle of parliamentary sovereignty unlimited and unlimitable, issued a > declaration that a parliamentary majority could pass any law it saw fit, it > was greeted with an out-cry of horror in the colonies. James Otis and Samuel > Adams in Massachusetts, Patrick Henry in Virginia and other colonial leaders > along the seaboard screamed \\"Treason\\" and \\"Magna Carta\\"! Such a doctrine, > they insisted, demolished the essence of all their British ancestors had > fought for, took the very savour out of that fine Anglo-Saxon liberty for > which the sages and patriots of England had died.Edwin Mims, Jr., The > Majority of the People (New York: Modern Age Books, 1941), p. 71. Subsequent developments Despite British recognition in 1783 of the independence of the United States, the Declaratory Act remained in force for the British Empire's remaining colonies in the western hemisphere. The Act was not repealed until 1964, by which time the handful of remaining British colonies in the West Indies were governed under constitutions explicitly granted under the authority of Parliament (in particular by the West Indies Act 1962). However, since the Taxation of Colonies Act 1778 passed during the American Revolution, the British Parliament has never again attempted to directly impose taxation upon any of its colonies (today known as British overseas territories). Instead, whenever the British government perceived a need for colonial contributions towards the defence of the Empire (such as happened during the Anglo-German naval arms race of the early 20th century), it appealed to the colonial governments themselves to make those contributions, with varying levels of success.

A herdboy with his sheep in search of fodder at Chinawal, India Shepherd sheep in Patagonia, Argentina A herder is a worker who lives a pastoralist life gathering and caring for a herd of domesticated livestocks. Different to a husbandry worker, who works at fixed (and often fenced) grazing settlements known as ranches, herders move with the livestocks wandering around open wild pastures in a nomadic/semi-nomadic fashion. Overview Usually if the person is a minor, he is called herdboy, an adult male herder is usually called a herdsman and a female herder by contrast is also called a herdswoman. Because their work is necessarily mostly outdoors, they move around from place to place in the course of their labours. The possibility exists that the lands upon which their beasts graze are not claimed as any single person's property. A number of romantic legends have sprung up around some aspects of their way of life. Some herders whose lifestyles have become mainstays of fiction include: * The shepherd, featured in pastoral literature * The cowboy, hero of Western movies and fiction, featured in romantic tales from the United States * The gaucho, who in the Pampas of Argentina, Uruguay, and the Southernmost Brazil, plays a similar role to the cowboy.

The franchise has been a member of various leagues preceding the Midwest League. They have been a member of the Central Association (1949), Western League (1934‚Äì1937), Mississippi Valley League (1922‚Äì1932), Central Association (1913‚Äì1917), Illinois‚ÄìIndiana‚ÄìIowa League (1901‚Äì1909, 1920‚Äì1921, 1938‚Äì1942, 1950‚Äì1961), Western Association (1896‚Äì1899), Eastern Iowa League (1895) and the Illinois‚ÄìIowa League (1890‚Äì1891). The team also had numerous nicknames prior to joining the Midwest League: Cedar Rapids Braves (1958‚Äì1962), Cedar Rapids Raiders (1953‚Äì1957), Cedar Rapids Indians (1950‚Äì1952), Cedar Rapids Rockets (1949), Cedar Rapids Raiders (1934‚Äì1942), Cedar Rapids Red Raiders (1963‚Äì1964), Cedar Rapids Bunnies (1904‚Äì1932), Cedar Rapids Rabbits (1896‚Äì1903) and Cedar Rapids Canaries (1890‚Äì1891). When Cedar Rapids was awarded a Midwest League franchise in 1962, the franchise switched back to the Red Raiders (1962‚Äì1964) nickname. Subsequently, the team used the name of the major league franchise it affiliated with: the Cardinals (1965‚Äì1972), the Astros (1973‚Äì1974), the Giants (1975‚Äì1979), and the Reds (1980‚Äì1992). The team adopted the current \\"Kernels\\" nickname before the 1993 season. On the field, the franchise won Midwest League championships in 1988, 1992, and 1994. Ballpark The team's first home ballpark was Belden Hill Park, followed by the original Veterans Memorial Stadium, which opened in 1949. In August 2000 voters approved a referendum to build a new ballpark adjacent to the old one, which was demolished after the 2001 season. The new Veterans Memorial Stadium was completed in time for the opening of the 2002 season, and the Kernels set a franchise attendance record of 196,066 in the new park's inaugural year.

Species Plantarum 2: 887 in Latin The plants are native to the Americas, growing naturally from the southwestern United States into South America, but some species have become naturalized around the world. One species, T. minuta, is considered a noxious invasive plant in some areas. Description Tagetes species vary in size from 0.1 to 2.2 m tall. Most species have pinnate green leaves. Blooms naturally occur in golden, orange, yellow, and white colors, often with maroon highlights. Floral heads are typically (1-) to 4‚Äì6 cm diameter, generally with both ray florets and disc florets. In horticulture, they tend to be planted as annuals, although the perennial species are gaining popularity. They have fibrous roots. Depending on the species, Tagetes species grow well in almost any sort of soil. Most horticultural selections grow best in soil with good drainage, even though some cultivars are known to have good tolerance to drought.Cicevan R, Al Hassan M, Sestras AF, Prohens J, Vicente O, Sestras RE, Boscaiu M. (2016) Screening for drought tolerance in cultivars of the ornamental genus Tagetes (Asteraceae) PeerJ 4:e2133 https://doi.org/10.7717/peerj.2133 Nomenclature The name Tagetes is from the name of the Etruscan Tages, born from the plowing of the earth. It likely refers to the ease with which plants of this genus come out each year either by the seeds produced in the previous year, or by the stems which regrow from the stump already in place. The common name in English, marigold, is derived from Mary's gold, a name first applied to a similar plant native to Europe, Calendula officinalis. The most commonly cultivated varieties of Tagetes are known variously as African marigolds (usually referring to cultivars and hybrids of Tagetes erecta), or French marigolds (usually referring to hybrids and cultivars of Tagetes patula, many of which were developed in France). The so-called signet marigolds are hybrids derived mostly from Tagetes tenuifolia.  Cultivation and uses  Tagetes patula flowers Depending on the species, marigold foliage has a musky, pungent scent, though some varieties have been bred to be scentless. It is said to deter some common insect pests, as well as nematodes. Tagetes species are hence often used in companion planting for tomato, eggplant, chili pepper, tobacco, and potato. Due to antibacterial thiophenes exuded by the roots, Tagetes should not be planted near any legume crop.Soule, J. A. 1993. Biosystematics of Tagetes (Compositae). Ph.D. Dissertation, University of Texas. Some of the perennial species are deer-, rabbit-, rodent- and javalina or peccary-resistant. T. minuta (khakibush or huacatay), originally from South America, has been used as a source of essential oil for the perfume and industry known as tagette or \\"marigold oil\\", and as a flavourant in the food and tobacco industries. It is commonly cultivated in South Africa, where the species is also a useful pioneer plant in the reclamation of disturbed land. The florets of Tagetes erecta are rich in the orange-yellow carotenoid lutein and are used as a food colour (INS number E161b) in the European Union for foods such as pasta, vegetable oil, margarine, mayonnaise, salad dressing, baked goods, confectionery, dairy products, ice cream, yogurt, citrus juice and mustard. In the United States, however, the powders and extracts are only approved as colorants in poultry feed. Marigolds are recorded as a food plant for some Lepidoptera caterpillars including the dot moth, and a nectar source for other butterflies. They are often part of butterfly gardening plantings. In the wild, many species are pollinated by beetles.  Cultural significance  =Tagetes lucida= The species Tagetes lucida, known as peric√≥n, is used to prepare a sweetish, anise-flavored medicinal tea in Mexico. It is also used as a culinary herb in many warm climates, as a substitute for tarragon, and offered in the nursery as \\"Texas tarragon\\" or \\"Mexican mint marigold\\". =Tagetes minuta= Tagetes minuta, native to southern South America, is a tall, upright marigold plant with small flowers used as a culinary herb in Peru, Ecuador, and parts of Chile and Bolivia, where it is called by the Incan term huacatay. The paste is used to make the popular potato dish called ocopa. Having both \\"green\\" and \\"yellow/orange\\" notes, the taste and odor of fresh T. minuta is like a mixture of sweet basil, tarragon, mint and citrus. It is also used as a medicinal tea for gastrointestinal complaints and specifically against nematodes.Soule, J. A. 1993. Tagetes minuta: A Potential New Herb from South America.

It is always sold in the markets for daily worships and rituals. The marigold is also widely cultivated in India and Thailand, particularly the species T. erecta, T. patula, and T. tenuifolia. Vast quantities of marigolds are used in garlands and decoration for weddings, festivals, and religious events. Marigold cultivation is extensively seen in Telangana, Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, West Bengal, Karnataka, and Uttar Pradesh for Deepawali market. states of India. In Ukraine, chornobryvtsi (T. erecta, T. patula, and the signet marigold, l. tenuifolia) are regarded as one of the national symbols, and are often mentioned in songs, poems, and tales.

Rheum dries and gathers as a crust in the corners of the eyes or the mouth, on the eyelids, or under the nose. It is formed by a combination of mucus (in the case of the eyes, consisting of mucin discharged from the cornea or the conjunctiva), nasal mucus, blood cells, skin cells, or dust. Rheum from the eyes is particularly common. Dried rheum is commonly called sleep, sleepy-seeds, sleepy buds,Eric Partridge, Paul Beale, ed., A Dictionary of Slang and Unconventional English, 8th edition, 1984, s.v. sleepy sand, sleepies, eye boogers, eye goop, sleep dust, or sleepy dirt. When the individual is awake, blinking of the eyelid causes rheum to be washed away with tears via the nasolacrimal duct. The absence of this action during sleep, however, results in a small amount of dry rheum accumulating in corners of the eye, most notably in children. A number of conditions can increase the production of rheum in the eye. In the case of allergic conjunctivitis, the buildup of rheum can be considerable, preventing the sufferer from opening the eye upon waking without prior cleansing of the eye area. The presence of pus in an instance of heavy rheum buildup can indicate dry eye or conjunctivitis, among other infections. In infants, the tear ducts (that drain the tears) occasionally fail to open, resulting in the overflow of tears onto the cheeks (epiphora) and rheum deposition on the surrounding skin.

According to this biological model, there is a lipid bilayer (two molecules thick layer consisting primarily of amphipathic phospholipids) in which protein molecules are embedded. The lipid bilayer gives fluidity and elasticity to the membrane. Small amounts of carbohydrates are also found in the cell membrane. The biological model, which was devised by SJ Singer and G. L. Nicolson in 1972, describes the cell membrane as a two-dimensional liquid that restricts the lateral diffusion of membrane components. Such domains are defined by the existence of regions within the membrane with special lipid and protein cocoon that promote the formation of lipid rafts or protein and glycoprotein complexes. Another way to define membrane domains is the association of the lipid membrane with the cytoskeleton filaments and the extracellular matrix through membrane proteins. The current model describes important features relevant to many cellular processes, including: cell-cell signaling, apoptosis, cell division, membrane budding, and cell fusion. The fluid mosaic model is the most acceptable model of the plasma membrane. Its main function is to separate the contents of the cell from the outside. Chemical makeup Chemically a cell membrane is composed of four components: (1) Phospholipids (2) Proteins (3) Carbohydrates (4) Cholesterol Experimental evidence The fluid property of functional biological membranes had been determined through labeling experiments, x-ray diffraction, and calorimetry. These studies showed that integral membrane proteins diffuse at rates affected by the viscosity of the lipid bilayer in which they were embedded, and demonstrated that the molecules within the cell membrane are dynamic rather than static. Previous models of biological membranes included the Robertson Unit Membrane Model and the Davidson-Danielli Tri-Layer model. These models had proteins present as sheets neighboring a lipid layer, rather than incorporated into the phospholipid bilayer. Other models described repeating, regular units of protein and lipid. These models were not well supported by microscopy and thermodynamic data, and did not accommodate evidence for dynamic membrane properties. The Frye-Edidin experiment showed that when two cells are fused the proteins of both diffuse around the membrane and mingle rather than being locked to their area of the membrane. An important experiment that provided evidence supporting fluid and dynamic biological was performed by Frye and Edidin. They used Sendai virus to force human and mouse cells to fuse and form a heterokaryon. Using antibody staining, they were able to show that the mouse and human proteins remained segregated to separate halves of the heterokaryon a short time after cell fusion. However, the proteins eventually diffused and over time the border between the two halves was lost. Lowering the temperature slowed the rate of this diffusion by causing the membrane phospholipids to transition from a fluid to a gel phase. Singer and Nicolson rationalized the results of these experiments using their fluid mosaic model. The fluid mosaic model explains changes in structure and behavior of cell membranes under different temperatures, as well as the association of membrane proteins with the membranes. While Singer and Nicolson had substantial evidence drawn from multiple subfields to support their model, recent advances in fluorescence microscopy and structural biology have validated the fluid mosaic nature of cell membranes. Subsequent developments =Membrane asymmetry= Additionally, the two leaflets of biological membranes are asymmetric and divided into subdomains composed of specific proteins or lipids, allowing spatial segregation of biological processes associated with membranes. Cholesterol and cholesterol-interacting proteins can concentrate into lipid rafts and constrain cell signaling processes to only these rafts. Another form of asymmetry was shown by the work of Mouritsen and Bloom in 1984, where they proposed a Mattress Model of lipid-protein interactions to address the biophysical evidence that the membrane can range in thickness and hydrophobicity of proteins. =Non-bilayer membranes= The existence of non- bilayer lipid formations with important biological functions was confirmed subsequent to publication of the fluid mosaic model. These membrane structures may be useful when the cell needs to propagate a non bilayer form, which occurs during cell division and the formation of a gap junction. =Membrane curvature= The membrane bilayer is not always flat. Local curvature of the membrane can be caused by the asymmetry and non-bilayer organization of lipids as discussed above. More dramatic and functional curvature is achieved through BAR domains, which bind to phosphatidylinositol on the membrane surface, assisting in vesicle formation, organelle formation and cell division. Curvature development is in constant flux and contributes to the dynamic nature of biological membranes. =Lipid movement within the membrane= During the decade of 1970, it was acknowledged that individual lipid molecules undergo free lateral diffusion within each of the layers of the lipid membrane. Diffusion occurs at a high speed, with an average lipid molecule diffusing ~2 ¬µm, approximately the length of a large bacterial cell, in about 1 second. It has also been observed that individual lipid molecules rotate rapidly around their own axis. Moreover, phospholipid molecules can, although they seldom do, migrate from one side of the lipid bilayer to the other (a process known as flip-flop). However, flip-flop might be enhanced by flippase enzymes. The processes described above influence the disordered nature of lipid molecules and interacting proteins in the lipid membranes, with consequences to membrane fluidity, signaling, trafficking and function. Restrictions to bilayer fluidity There are restrictions to the lateral mobility of the lipid and protein components in the fluid membrane imposed by the formation of subdomains within the lipid bilayer. These subdomains arise by several processes e.g. binding of membrane components to the extracellular matrix, nanometric membrane regions with a particular biochemical composition that promote the formation of lipid rafts and protein complexes mediated by protein-protein interactions. Furthermore, protein-cytoskeleton associations mediate the formation of ‚Äúcytoskeletal fences‚Äù, corrals wherein lipid and membrane proteins can diffuse freely, but that they can seldom leave. Restriction on lateral diffusion rates of membrane components is very important because it allows the functional specialization of particular regions within the cell membranes. =Lipid rafts= Lipid rafts are membrane nanometric platforms with a particular lipid and protein composition that laterally diffuse, navigating on the liquid bilipid layer. Sphingolipids and cholesterol are important building blocks of the lipid rafts. =Protein complexes= Cell membrane proteins and glycoproteins do not exist as single elements of the lipid membrane, as first proposed by Singer and Nicolson in 1972. Rather, they occur as diffusing complexes within the membrane. The assembly of single molecules into these macromolecular complexes has important functional consequences for the cell; such as ion and metabolite transport, signaling, cell adhesion, and migration. =Cytoskeletal fences (corrals) and binding to the extracellular matrix= Some proteins embedded in the bilipid layer interact with the extracellular matrix outside the cell, cytoskeleton filaments inside the cell, and septin ring-like structures. These interactions have a strong influence on shape and structure, as well as on compartmentalization. Moreover, they impose physical constraints that restrict the free lateral diffusion of proteins and at least some lipids within the bilipid layer. When integral proteins of the lipid bilayer are tethered to the extracellular matrix, they are unable to diffuse freely. Proteins with a long intracellular domain may collide with a fence formed by cytoskeleton filaments. Both processes restrict the diffusion of proteins and lipids directly involved, as well as of other interacting components of the cell membranes. S.cerevisiae septins Septin ring-like structures (in green) can pinch cell membranes and split them into subdomains. Septins are a family of GTP-binding proteins highly conserved among eukaryotes. Prokaryotes have similar proteins called paraseptins. They form compartmentalizing ring-like structures strongly associated with the cell membranes. Septins are involved in the formation of structures such as, cilia and flagella, dendritic spines, and yeast buds. Historical timeline * 1895 ‚Äì Ernest Overton hypothesized that cell membranes are made out of lipids. * 1925 ‚Äì Evert Gorter and Fran√ßois Grendel found that red blood cell membranes are formed by a fatty layer two molecules thick, i.e. they described the bilipid nature of the cell membrane. * 1935 ‚Äì Hugh Davson and James Danielli proposed that lipid membranes are layers composed by proteins and lipids with pore-like structures that allow specific permeability for certain molecules. Then, they suggested a model for the cell membrane, consisting of a lipid layer surrounded by protein layers at both sides of it. * 1957 ‚Äì J. David Robertson, based on electron microscopy studies, establishes the \\"Unit Membrane Hypothesis\\". This, states that all membranes in the cell, i.e. plasma and organelle membranes, have the same structure: a bilayer of phospholipids with monolayers of proteins at both sides of it. * 1972 ‚Äì SJ Singer and GL Nicolson proposed the fluid mosaic model as an explanation for the data and latest evidence regarding the structure and thermodynamics of cell membranes.

The university was founded on December 2, 1409 by Frederick I, Elector of Saxony and his brother William II, Margrave of Meissen, and originally comprised the four scholastic faculties. Since its inception, the university has engaged in teaching and research for over 600 years without interruption. Famous alumni include Leibniz, Goethe, Leopold von Ranke, Friedrich Nietzsche, Robert Schumann, Richard Wagner, Tycho Brahe, Georgius Agricola, Angela Merkel and the nine Nobel laureates associated with the university.  History  Memorial stone to the foundation of Leipzig University = Founding and development until 1900 = Leipzig University main building (1917). It was demolished by the socialist administration in 1968. The university was modelled on the University of Prague, from which the German-speaking faculty members withdrew to Leipzig after the Jan Hus crisis and the Decree of Kutn√° Hora. The Alma mater Lipsiensis opened in 1409, after it had been officially endorsed by Pope Alexander V in his Bull of Acknowledgment on (September 9 of that year). Its first rector was Johann von M√ºnsterberg. From its foundation, the Paulinerkirche served as the university church. After the Reformation, the church and the monastery buildings were donated to the university in 1544. In order to secure independent and sustainable funding, the university was endowed with the lordship over nine villages east of Leipzig (university villages). It kept this status for nearly 400 years until land reforms were carried out in the 19th century. During the decline and dissolution of the Ottoman Empire in the 19th and first decade of 20th century together with some other German universities Leipzig University turned into one of the centers of higher education for state administrations and elites of newly independent Balkan states (Romania, Greece, Bulgaria and Serbia) educating over 5,500 students from the region in 1859-1909 period. As many European universities, the University of Leipzig was structured into colleges (collegia) responsible for organising accommodation and collegiate lecturing. Among the colleges of Leipzig were the Small College, the Large College, the (also known as the New College), the College of our Lady and the Pauliner-College. There were also private residential halls (bursen, see English 'bursaries'). The colleges had jurisdiction over their members. The college structure was abandoned later and today only the names survive. During the first centuries, the university grew slowly and was a rather regional institution. This changed, however, during the 19th century when the university became a world-class institution of higher education and research. At the end of the 19th century, important scholars such as Bernhard Windscheid (one of the fathers of the German Civil Code) and Wilhelm Ostwald (viewed as a founder of modern physical chemistry) taught at Leipzig. Formerly organized as a collegiate university, the Red College of Leipzig University was established in the 16th century. Leipzig University was one of the first German universities to allow women to register as \\"guest students\\". At its general assembly in 1873, the thanked the University of Leipzig and Prague for allowing women to attend as guest students. This was the year that the first woman in Germany obtained her JD, Johanna von Evreinov. Until the beginning of the Second World War, Leipzig University attracted a number of renowned scholars and later Nobel Prize laureates, including Paul Ehrlich, Felix Bloch, Werner Heisenberg and Sin- Itiro Tomonaga. Many of the university's alumni became important scientists. = Nazi period = Under Nazi rule many Jews' degrees were cancelled; some were later reinstated as Karl-Marx University degrees by the GDR. Noteworthy Nazis, such as Max Clara (chair of anatomy) taught at the university and were appointed to positions with great authority. The university was kept open throughout World War II, even after the destruction of its buildings. During the war the acting rector, Erich Maschke, described the continuation of the university in a memo on May 11, 1945, announcing the vote for a new rector: By the end of the war 60 per cent of the university's buildings and 70 per cent of its books had been destroyed. = The university under the German Democratic Republic = The university reopened after the war on February 5, 1946, but it was affected by the uniformity imposed on social institutions in the Soviet occupation zone. In 1948 the freely elected student council was disbanded and replaced by Free German Youth members. The chairman of the Student Council, Wolfgang Natonek, and other members were arrested and imprisoned, but the university was also a nucleus of resistance. Thus began the Belter group, with flyers for free elections. The head of the group, Herbert Belter, was executed in 1951 in Moscow. The German Democratic Republic was created in 1949, and in 1953 for Karl Marx Year the university was renamed by its government the Karl Marx University, Leipzig after Karl Marx. In 1968, the partly damaged Augusteum, including Johanneum and Albertinum and the intact Paulinerkirche, were demolished to make way for a redevelopment of the university, carried out between 1973 and 1978. The dominant building of the university was the University Tower (now City-Hochhaus Leipzig), built between 1968 and 1972 in the form of an open book. = After the reunification of Germany = Main building of Leipzig University since 2012, the Augusteum at Augustusplatz. Leipzig's classicist university library, the Bibliotheca Albertina. In 1991, following the reunification of Germany, the university's name was restored to the original Leipzig University (Alma mater lipsiensis). The reconstruction of the University Library, which was heavily damaged during the war and in the GDR barely secured, was completed in 2002. With the delivery of the University Tower to a private user, the university was forced to spread some faculties over several locations in the city. It controversially redesigned its historical centre at the Augustusplatz. In 2002, Behet Bonzio received the second prize in the architectural competition; a first prize was not awarded by the jury. A lobby with partial support of the provincial government called for the rebuilding of St. Paul's Church and Augusteum. This caused the resistance of the university leadership, the majority of the students and population of Leipzig. On March 24, 2004 a jury chose a design by Dutch architect Erick van Egeraat, which was well received by almost all parties. He recalls the outer form of the St. Paul's Church (today called Paulinum) and Augusteum, and abstracted the original building complex. Renovations began in the summer of 2005. In 2008 the university was able to prevail in the nationwide \\"Initiative of Excellence\\" of Germany and it was granted the graduate school \\"BuildMoNa: Leipzig School of Natural Sciences ‚Äì Building with Molecules and Nano-objects\\". In addition, the university was able to receive grants from the Saxon excellence initiative for the \\"Life\\" project ‚Äì a project that tries to explore common diseases more effectively. Also in 2008 the \\"Bach Archive\\" was associated with the university. In 2009, the Leipzig University celebrated its 600th anniversary with over 300 scientific and cultural lectures and exhibitions, reflecting the role of the university's research and teaching from its beginning.  Campus  The university's urban campus comprises several locations. All in all, the university is spread across 38 locations in Leipzig. The main buildings in the city center are still located on the same land plots as the earliest university buildings in 1409. The university's buildings in the center of Leipzig underwent substantial reconstruction from 2005, the new university's main building being drafted by Dutch architect Erick van Egeraat. The estimated total cost for the renovation project is 140 million euros. The new buildings were scheduled to be completed in 2009/2010, in time for the university's 600th anniversary celebrations. Besides the faculties and other teaching institutions, several other bodies serve the university: the University Library, a university archive and administration, numerous museums (e.g. the Museum for Music Instruments and the Museum of Ancient Egypt) and the university hospital. The university's Leipzig Botanical Garden, the second-oldest botanical garden in Europe. was established in 1542. The University's Musical Instrument Museum includes one of the world's three surviving pianos built by Bartolomeo Cristofori, the piano's inventor. Five other Cristofori instruments are included in the Museum's collections. Key Central institutions of the university are * Centre for Biotechnology and Biomedicine * Career Service * Deutsches Literaturinstitut Leipzig/DLL * German Centre for Integrative Biodiversity Research (iDiv) Halle-Jena-Leipzig * Higher Education Didactics Centre Saxony * Kustodie (Art Collection) * Leipzig University Music * Research Academy Leipzig * Language Centre * Saxon Preparatory Courses (Studienkolleg Sachsen) * Translational Centre for Regenerative Medicine Leipzig * University Archive * University Library * University Computer Centre * Centre for University Sport * Centre for Teacher Training and School Research * Centre for Media and Communikation  Library  The University Library of Leipzig was established in 1543. It is one of the oldest German university libraries and it serves as a source of literature and information for the Leipzig University as well as the general public in the region.

They are located in Des Moines, Iowa, and play their home games at Principal Park, which opened in 2004. The team was originally known as the Iowa Oaks when it was established as a member of the Triple-A American Association in 1969. The Cubs took on the moniker of their major league affiliate in 1982. They joined the PCL in 1998. Their only league title in franchise history is the 1993 American Association championship. History =Iowa Oaks (1969‚Äì1981)= Iowa Oaks logo during White Sox affiliation Triple-A Minor League Baseball came to Iowa's capital city in 1969, as the Iowa Oaks of the American Association began play as an affiliate of the Oakland Athletics. They played their home games at Sec Taylor Stadium, which opened in 1947 and was located at the confluence of the Des Moines and Raccoon Rivers. Many future Major League Baseball stars such as sluggers Bill McNulty, Hall-of-Famer Harold Baines, Pat Tabler, and 1971 Cy Young and MVP Award winning left-handed pitcher Vida Blue spent time with the Oaks. Both Bucky Dent and future Hall-of-Famer Goose Gossage played for the Oaks early in their careers. The A's farm club experienced winning seasons in 1970 and 1971, but third and second-place finishes kept them out of the playoffs. The Oaks became the top affiliate of the Chicago White Sox in 1973. They won the East Division that season with an 83‚Äì53 record, earning a spot in the best-of-seven American Association championship playoffs, but they were defeated by the Tulsa Oilers, 4‚Äì3. Manager Joe Sparks won the American Association Manager of the Year Award. Oaks pitchers tossed two no-hitters in 1974, both in away games. The first was pitched by Joe Henderson against the Wichita Aeros on July 31. The second occurred on August 25 when Butch Stinson no-hit the Indianapolis Indians. After one season as the Houston Astros' Triple-A club in 1975, Iowa returned to the White Sox organization in 1976. Despite a number of winning seasons, they failed to qualify for the postseason during the five years of their second affiliation with Chicago. On September 1, 1977, Chris Knapp and Fred Howard combined to no-hit the Omaha Royals. On May 26, 1978, Jack Kucek tossed a no-hitter at Sec Taylor Stadium against the Oklahoma City 89ers. Former St. Louis Cardinals manager Tony La Russa managed the Iowa Oaks in 1979 prior to becoming manager of the White Sox. Pitcher Dewey Robinson was selected for the 1979 American Association Most Valuable Pitcher Award after achieving a record of 13‚Äì7 and 9 saves with a 2.93 earned run average and 76 strikeouts. =Iowa Cubs (1982‚Äìpresent)= In 1981, the team affiliated with the Chicago Cubs. After a final season as the Oaks, they adopted the nickname of their parent team in 1982 becoming the Iowa Cubs. The name is often shortened to \\"I-Cubs\\" to avoid confusion with the major league team. Iowa teams of the 1980s often finished high in the standings but were unable to qualify for the championship playoffs. The only exceptions being in 1983 and 1984 when they earned spots in the semi-finals, but were eliminated by Denver both years. Cubbie Bear, the team mascot Members of the 1982 team garnered several league awards. Jay Howell, who struck out 139 batters on the way to a 13‚Äì4 record and a 2.36 ERA, won the AA Most Valuable Pitcher Award. Skipper Jim Napier was the league's Manager of the Year. Outfielder Mel Hall was the Rookie of the Year after accruing a batting average of .329 while hitting 34 doubles and 32 home runs and driving in 125 runs. Another Cub outfielder, Joe Carter won the 1983 Rookie of the Year Award after stealing 40 bases and hitting .307 with 22 homers. In 1984, Reggie Patterson fired a no- hitter against the Omaha Royals on August 21. Vince Cotroneo was the team's radio play-by-play announcer in 1988; he was named the National Association League's Minor League Announcer of the Year. Sec Taylor Stadium was demolished after the 1991 season and a new facility of the same name was constructed on the site in time for the Cubs' 1992 season. Following a dismal 1992 campaign in which the Cubs went 51‚Äì92, they rebounded to win the 1993 West Division title at 85‚Äì59. They met the Nashville Sounds in the best-of-seven championship series. Leading the series 3‚Äì1, the Cubs lost two consecutive games and were forced to a game seven. In the final game, Nashville held a 2‚Äì1 lead from the third inning to the seventh before the Cubs tied the game necessitating extra innings. An eleventh-inning walk-off home run by Iowa's Tuffy Rhodes ended the game and gave the Cubs their first league title. Outfielder Eduardo Zambrano garnered the American Association Most Valuable Player Award after collecting 115 RBI and hitting 32 homers with a .303 average. Iowa did not reach the playoffs again until 1997. They captured the West Division title with a 74‚Äì69 record before defeating the New Orleans Zephyrs in the semi-finals. They were swept by the Buffalo Bisons, 3‚Äì0, in the championship round. The American Association, of which the Cubs had been members since their inaugural 1969 campaign, disbanded after the 1997 season. Its teams were absorbed by the two remaining Triple-A leagues‚Äîthe International League and Pacific Coast League (PCL). The Cubs joined the PCL and won the American Conference Central Division title in 1998 with an 85‚Äì59 record. In the American Conference series, they were bested by the New Orleans Zephyrs, 2‚Äì1, in a rain-shortened series. Manager Terry Kennedy won the Pacific Coast League Manager of the Year Award. Brett Dolan called Iowa games on the radio in 1998 and 1999 before being hired by the Houston Astros. Dolan was replaced by Dave Raymond, who broadcast games from 2000 to 2004 before going on to work for several major league teams. Former Chicago Cubs manager and Iowa native Bruce Kimm managed the I-Cubs from 2001 to 2002. He led them to the 2001 division title (83‚Äì60), but they were again eliminated by New Orleans in the conference series. A Cubs game at Principal Park in 2014 Mike Quade, former manager of the Chicago Cubs, managed Iowa from 2003 to 2006. Playing at the renamed Principal Park, the Cubs ended the 2004 season at 79‚Äì64 giving them another division title. This time, they defeated the Oklahoma RedHawks, 3‚Äì2, to win the American Conference championship. In the best-of- five Pacific Coast League championship series, they lost to the Sacramento River Cats, 3‚Äì0. In 2007, catcher Geovany Soto, with a .353 average, 26 home runs, and 109 RBI, won the PCL Most Valuable Player Award. Led by PCL Manager of the Year Pat Listach, the 2008 Cubs won the American Conference North Division (83‚Äì59), but were beaten in the conference series by Oklahoma, 3‚Äì2. In 2010, the team was managed by Baseball Hall of Fame inductee Ryne Sandberg who was also selected as the league's Manager of the Year. First baseman Bryan LaHair won the 2010 PCL MVP Award with his .331 average, 38 homers, and 109 RBI. On May 7, 2014, Iowa starter Chris Rusin pitched a no-hitter against the New Orleans Zephyrs. In May 2014, Manny Ramirez signed a contract as a part- time player/coach for the I-Cubs. In 2015, right-hander Carlos Pimentel won the PCL Pitcher of the Year Award after achieving a 12‚Äì6 record with 118 strikeouts and a 2.95 ERA. The Cubs returned to the postseason in 2019 having won the division 75‚Äì65, but were eliminated by the Round Rock Express in the American Conference series. Many future Cubs stars have played in Des Moines before they were called up to Wrigley Field. Some notable I-Cubs alumni include Greg Maddux, Rafael Palmeiro, Mark Grace, Doug Glanville, Joe Carter, Corey Patterson, Carlos Zambrano, Kyle Farnsworth, Kerry Wood, Steve Trachsel, Tuffy Rhodes, Bruce Kimm, Shawon Dunston, H√©ctor Villanueva, Mark Prior, Sam Fuld, John Grabow, and Rod Beck. Wood and Prior both made rehabilitation starts for the I-Cubs in 2004 and 2005 before returning to the Chicago Cubs' active roster, and many Cubs players such as Derrek Lee, Daryle Ward, Alfonso Soriano, and Ryan Dempster have also made stops in Des Moines for rehab purposes. Many Cubs stars such as Kris Bryant, Kyle Schwarber, Anthony Rizzo, and Javier Baez also made stops in Iowa.

Free Will Baptist is a denomination and group of people that believe in free grace, free salvation and free will. The movement can be traced back to the 1600s with the development of General Baptism in England. Its formal establishment is widely linked to the English theologian, Thomas Helwys who led the Baptist movement to believe in general atonement. He was an advocate of religious liberty at a time when to hold to such views could be dangerous and punishable by death. He died in prison as a consequence of the religious persecution of Protestant dissenters under King James I. In 1702 Paul Palmer would go on to establish the movement in North Carolina and in 1727 formed the Free Will Baptist Church of Chowan. Many Calvinists became Free Will Baptists in the 19th century. With the establishment of Free Will Baptists in the South, Benjamin Randall developed the movement in the Northeastern United States, specifically Maine, Massachusetts, and New Hampshire. From their beginning, Free Will Baptists, in common with many groups of English Dissenters and Separatists from the Church of England, followed Brownist notions of self-governance of local churches. The notion of free will was a systematic rejection of the Puritan movement, due to its overall religious beliefs and lack of social mobility. History Return of Roger Williams a later supporter of the movement, after denouncing the Puritan movement in 1644 Free Will Baptists can be traced to General Baptists from England who settled in the American colonies in the late 17th century. The first Baptists, who originated with the ministry of Thomas Helwys near London in 1611, were General Baptists. That is, they believed that the atonement of Jesus Christ was \\"general\\" (for all) rather than \\"particular\\" (only for the elect). It shares a common history, name, and an acceptance of the Arminian doctrine. Benjamin Laker was an English Baptist who arrived in colonial Carolina as early as 1685. Laker had been associated with Thomas Grantham, a prominent General Baptist theologian and writer, and had signed the 1663 edition of the General Baptists' Standard Confession of Faith. The earliest Free Will Baptists in America developed from English General Baptists in Carolina, who were dubbed \\"Freewillers\\" by their enemies and later assumed the name. Two distinct branches of Free Will Baptists developed in America. The first and earliest was the General Baptist movement described above, known as the Palmer movement in North Carolina, from which the majority of modern- day Free Will Baptists have their origin. The later movement was the Randall movement, which arose in the late 18th century in New Hampshire. These two groups developed independently of each other. =The Palmer line= In 1702, a disorganized group of General Baptists in Carolina wrote a request for help to the General Baptist Association in England. Though no help was forthcoming, Paul Palmer, whose wife Johanna was the stepdaughter of Benjamin Laker, would labor among these people 25 years later, founding the first \\"Free Will\\" Baptist church in Chowan, North Carolina in 1727. Palmer organized at least three churches in North Carolina. His labors, though important, were short. Leadership would descend to Joseph Parker, William Parker, Josiah Hart, William Sojourner and others. Joseph Parker was part of the organization of the Chowan church and ministered among the Carolina churches for over 60 years. From one church in 1727, they grew to over 20 churches by 1755. After 1755, missionary labors conducted by the Philadelphia Baptist Association converted most of these churches to the Particular Baptist positions of unconditional election and limited atonement. By 1770, only 4 churches and 4 ministers remained of the General Baptist persuasion. By the end of 18th century, these churches were commonly referred to as \\"Free Will Baptist\\", and this would later be referred to as the \\"Palmer line of Free Will Baptists\\". The churches in the Palmer line organized various associations and conferences, and finally organized a General Conference in 1921. Many Baptists from Calvinistic Baptist backgrounds, primarily Separate Baptists, became Free Will Baptists in the 19th century. =The Randall line= While the movement in the South was struggling, a new movement rose in the North through the work of Benjamin Randall (1749‚Äì1808). Randall initially united with the Particular Baptists in 1776, but broke with them in 1779 due to their strict views on predestination. In 1780, Randall formed a \\"Free\\" or \\"Freewill\\" (Randall would combine the words \\"free\\" and \\"will\\" into a single word) Baptist church in New Durham, New Hampshire. By 1782 twelve churches had been founded, and they organized a Quarterly Meeting. In 1792 a Yearly Meeting was organized. The \\"Randall\\" line itself split into two groups in 1835: * The \\"Bullockites\\", after founder Jeremiah Bullock (sometimes spelled \\"Bulloch\\" and \\"Bullochites\\"), which branched out to a small number of congregations in Maine and New Hampshire. * The \\"Buzzelites\\", after founder John Buzzell. The Bullockites, mostly under the name \\"Freewill Baptists\\", continued in Maine into the early 20th century, while the Buzzellites disappeared shortly after their founding. The \\"Randall\\" line of Freewill Baptists grew quickly. However, in 1911, the majority of the Randall Line churches (and all the denominational property) merged with the Northern Baptist Convention. Those churches that did not merge and remained Freewill Baptist joined with other Free Will Baptists in the Southwest and Midwest to organize the Cooperative General Association of Free Will Baptists in 1916. =The union of the lines= Fraternal relations had existed between the northern and southern Free Will Baptists, but the question of slavery, and later the Civil War, prevented any formal union until the 20th century. On November 5, 1935, representatives of the General Conference (Palmer) and the Cooperative General Association (a mixture of Randall and Palmer elements west of the Mississippi) met in Nashville, Tennessee, to unite and organize the National Association of Free Will Baptists. The majority of Free Will Baptist churches organized under this umbrella, which remains the largest of the Free Will Baptist groups to this day. Theology and practice Free Will Baptist congregations believe the Bible is the very word of God and without error in all that it affirms. Free Will Baptist Doctrine holds to the traditional Arminian position, based on the belief in a General Atonement, that it is possible to commit apostasy, or willfully reject one's faith. Faith is the condition for salvation, hence Free Will Baptists hold to \\"conditional eternal security.\\" An individual is \\"saved by faith and kept by faith.\\" In support of this concept, some Free Will Baptists refer to the Greek word translated \\"believeth\\" found in John 3:16 KJV. This is a continuous action verb, and can thus be read, \\"that whosoever believes and continues to believe shall not perish, but have everlasting life.\\" The concept is not of someone sinning occasionally and thus accidentally ending up \\"not saved,\\" but instead of someone \\"repudiating\\" his or her faith in Christ.. Thus \\"once saved, always saved\\" is rejected by the denomination. On Perseverance of the Saints from the official Treatise: > \\"There are strong grounds to hope that the truly regenerate will persevere > unto the end, and be saved, through the power of divine grace which is > pledged for their support; but their future obedience and final salvation > are neither determined nor certain, since through infirmity and manifold > temptations they are in danger of falling; and they ought, therefore, to > watch and pray lest they make shipwreck of their faith and be lost.\\" Free Will Baptists observe at least three ordinances: baptism, the Lord's Supper, and the Washing of the Saints' Feet, a rite occurring among some other evangelical groups but not practiced by the majority of Baptist denominations. Free Will Baptist congregations hold differing views on eschatology, with some holding premillennial and others amillennial views. Churches advocate (voluntary) tithing, totally abstaining from alcoholic beverages, and not working on Sunday, the \\"Christian Sabbath\\". Free Will Baptist bodies The National Association of Free Will Baptists is the largest of the Free Will Baptist groups. Other major Free Will Baptist groups include: * Original Free Will Baptist Convention ‚Äì a North Carolina-based body of Free Will Baptists that was organized in 1913 and initially joined the National Association of Free Will Baptists, but split from the National Association in 1961 due to some inner differences. The Convention comprised the majority of North Carolina-based Free Will Baptist churches, though a minority would split from the North Carolina state convention and maintain affiliation with the National Association. The Convention also maintains mission activity in eight countries ‚Äì Philippines, Mexico, Bulgaria, India, Nepal, Bangladesh, Liberia, and Guinea. * United American Free Will Baptist Church ‚Äì the largest body of African-American Free Will Baptist churches, organized in 1901 and headquartered in Kinston, North Carolina. * United American Free Will Baptist Conference ‚Äì a body of African-American Free Will Baptist churches that withdrew from the United American Free Will Baptist Church in 1968; headquartered in Lakeland, Florida. * Old Original Free Will Baptist Conference, an episcopal African-American association with six churches, centered in North Carolina. * Evangelical Free Baptist Church ‚Äì based in Illinois. In 1987 it had 22 churches and 2,500 members. * Unaffiliated Free Will Baptist local associations ‚Äì a number of local Free Will Baptist associations remain independent of the National Association, Original FWB Convention, and the two United American bodies. Researchers have identified 10 such associations, though there may be more. The unaffiliated associations of Free Will Baptists include over 300 churches with an estimated 22,000 members. They have no organization beyond the \\"local\\" level. References Further reading * Bryant, Scott.

Two cabinet members, Takashi Fukaya and Tokuichiro Tamazawa, lost their seats. The Democratic Party made major gains under the leadership of Yukio Hatoyama.

Although the term limit for the House of Representatives would have been reached in October 2000, Mori dissolved the House on June 2 in what became popularly known as the due to a controversial statement by Mori prior to the election, which preceded a slump in government approval ratings from 40% to 20%. The LDP government advocated continued public works spending while the opposition advocated less spending and more governmental reforms. The Social Democratic Party left the coalition in 1998 and re-join the opposition after years of coalition with the ideologically contrasting LDP. Meanwhile, the Komeito Party, a centrist party with roots from the Soka Gakkai based on the Nichiren Buddhist movement and despite almost decades of opposition against the LDP, shifted from centre towards conservatism. An electoral alliance between the once rivals of the Komeito and the LDP has been in affect since the Japanese General election in 2000. For the LDP, despite not being able to win an absolute majority of votes by itself in further elections (especially for the House of Councillors which the LDP lost majority since 1989), the Komeito party has been counted on since then to ensure a stable governing majority rule.

In some versions, the arm is raised upward at an angle; in others, it is held out parallel to the ground. In contemporary times, the former is widely considered a symbol of fascism that is commonly perceived to be based on a custom in ancient Rome.Winkler (2009), p. 2 However, no Roman text gives this description, and the Roman works of art that display salutational gestures bear little resemblance to the modern Roman salute. Beginning with Jacques-Louis David's painting The Oath of the Horatii (1784), an association of the gesture with Roman republican and imperial culture emerged. The gesture and its identification with Roman culture were further developed in other neoclassic artworks. This was further elaborated upon in popular culture during the late 19th and early 20th centuries in plays and films that portrayed the salute as an ancient Roman custom. These included the 1914 Italian film Cabiria whose intertitles were written by the nationalist poet Gabriele d'Annunzio. In 1919, d'Annunzio adopted the cinematographically depicted salute as a neo-imperial ritual when he led the occupation of Fiume. Through d'Annunzio's influence, the gesture soon became part of the rising Italian Fascist movement's symbolic repertoire. In 1923 the salute was gradually adopted by the Italian Fascist regime. It was then adopted and made compulsory within the Nazi Party in 1926, and gained national prominence in the German state when the Nazis took power in 1933. It was also adopted by other fascist, far right and ultranationalist movements. Since the end of World War II, displaying the Nazi variant of the salute has been a criminal offence in Germany, Austria, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, and Poland. Legal restrictions on its use in Italy are more nuanced and use there has generated controversy. Since the historicity of the salute has never been properly questioned, performing it is prosecutable only when \\"meant to exalt exponents, principles, events and methods\\" of the extinct National Fascist Party. The gesture and its variations continue to be used in neo-fascist, neo-Nazi, and Falangist contexts. Early Roman sources and images Trajan's Column, Plate LXII. Onlookers raise their arms to acclaim the emperor The modern gesture consists of stiffly extending the right arm frontally and raising it roughly 135 degrees from the body's vertical axis, with the palm of the hand facing down and the fingers stretched out and touching each other. According to common perceptions, this salute was based on an ancient Roman custom. However, this description is unknown in Roman literature and is never mentioned by ancient historians of Rome. Not a single Roman work of art displays a salute of this kind. The gesture of the raised right arm or hand in Roman and other ancient cultures that does exist in surviving literature and art generally had a significantly different function and is never identical with the modern straight-arm salute. The right hand (Lat. dextera, dextra; Gr. Œ¥ŒµŒæŒπŒ¨ - dexia) was commonly used in antiquity as a symbol of pledging trust, friendship or loyalty.K.E. Georges, Ausf√ºhrliches lateinisch-deutsches Handw√∂rterbuch, Leipzig, Hahn'sche Verlags-buchhandlung Lateinisch-deutscher theil. 1879‚Äì80. 2 v.--Deutsch-lateinischer theil 1882 2 v (reprint Berlin 2007), s.v. \\"dexter\\"; cf. Lewis-Short s.v. \\"dextera\\"; cf. LSJ s.v. \\"Œ¥ŒµŒæŒπŒ¨\\". For example, Cicero reported that Octavian pledged an oath to Julius Caesar while outstretching his right hand: \\"Although that youth [the young Caesar Octavian] is powerful and has told Antony off nicely: yet, after all, we must wait to see the end. But what a speech! He swore his oath with the words: 'so may I achieve the honours of my father!', and at the same time he stretched out his right hand in the direction of his statue.\\"It is unknown if Octavian's specific oath salute was a pre-existing Roman custom or if he modified a similar pledging gesture for his contio, but Cicero clearly disapproved of Octavian's performance, exclaiming: \\"I don't want to be saved by such a man\\"; cf. Cic. Att. 16.15.3.6: Quamquam enim ‚Ä†postea‚Ä† in praesentia belle iste puer retundit Antonium, tamen exitum exspectare debemus. at quae contio! nam est missa mihi. iurat \\"ita sibi parentis honores consequi liceat\\" et simul dextram intendit ad statuam.

[Nec servatoribus istis!] Augustus of Prima PortaSculptures commemorating military victories such as those on the Arch of Titus, the Arch of Constantine, or on the Column of Trajan are the best known examples of raised arms in art from this period.Winkler (2009), pp. 17 However these monuments do not display a single clear image of the Roman salute. The images closest in appearance to a raised arm salute are scenes in Roman sculpture and coins which show an adlocutio, acclamatio, adventus, or profectio.Winkler (2009), p. 20 These are occasions when a high-ranking official, such as a general or the Emperor, addresses individuals or a group, often soldiers. Unlike modern custom, in which both the leader and the people he addresses raise their arms, most of these scenes show only the senior official raising his hand.Winkler (2009), pp. 20‚Äì21 Occasionally it is a sign of greeting or benevolence, but usually it is used as an indication of power. An opposite depiction is the salutatio of a diogmites, a military police officer, who raises his right arm to greet his commander during his adventus on a relief from 2nd-century Ephesus.Probably as an acclamatio; note palm is perpendicular to the ground and thumb is sticking up cf. Graham Sumner, Roman military clothing: 100 BC ‚Äì AD 200, Oxford 2002, p. 47, pl. G3 (Diogmitoi [sic! correct plural: diogmitai]). An example of a salutational gesture of imperial power can be seen in the statue of Augustus of Prima Porta which follows certain guidelines set out by oratory scholars of his day. In Rhetorica ad Herennium the anonymous author states that the orator \\"will control himself in the entire frame of his body and in the manly angle of his flanks, with the extension of the arm in the impassioned moments of speech, and by drawing in the arm in relaxed moods\\". Quintilian states in his Institutio Oratoria: \\"Experts do not permit the hand to be raised above the level of the eyes or lowered beneath the breast; to such a degree is this true that it is considered a fault to direct the hand above the head or lower it to the lower part of the belly. It may be extended to the left within the limits of the shoulder, but beyond that it is not fitting.\\" 18th‚Äì19th centuries France The Tennis Court Oath (1791), by J-L David The Distribution of the Eagle Standards Beginning with Jacques-Louis David's painting The Oath of the Horatii (1784), an association of the gesture with Roman republican and imperial culture emerged.Winkler (2009), p. 55 The raised arm, first stretched out as a symbol of righteous fervor-as the Horatii evince it-and later as a symbol of political allegiance and religious-political unity between a people and its leader, becomes an important part of the iconography of new societies. In addition to its specific contemporary use the gesture comes to express, in a fashion that appears timeless and even mystical, an appeal to a higher being and to a heroic ancient past that had served as a model for most of Western civilization for centuries, although often in ways not supported by historical fact. David‚Äôs Oath of the Horatii provided the starting point for an arresting gesture that progressed from oath-taking to what will become known as the Roman salute. The painting shows the three sons of Horatius swear on their swords, held by their father, that they will defend Rome to the death. It is based on a historical event described by Livy (Book I, sections 24-6) and elaborated by Dionysius in Roman Antiquities (Book III). However, the moment depicted in David's painting is his own creation.Winkler (2009), p. 44 Neither Livy nor Dionysius mention any oath taking episode. Dionysius, the more detailed source, reports that the father had left to his sons the decision to fight then raised his hands to the heavens to thank the gods. Dominating the center of The Oath of the Horatii is the brothers' father, facing left. He has both hands raised. His left hand is holding three swords, while his right hand is empty, with fingers stretched but not touching. The brother closest to the viewer is holding his arm almost horizontally. The brother on the left is holding his arm slightly higher, while the third brother holds his hand higher still. While the first brother extends his right arm, the other two are extending their left arms. The succession of arms raised progressively higher leads to a gesture closely approximating the style used by fascists in the 20th century in Italy, albeit with the \\"wrong\\" arms. Art historian Albert Boime provides the following analysis: After the French Revolution of 1789, David was commissioned to depict the formation of the revolutionary government in a similar style. In the Tennis Court Oath (1792) the National Assembly are all depicted with their arms outstretched, united in an upward gesture comparable to that of the Horatii, as they swear to create a new constitution.Parker (1990), p. 87 The painting was never finished, but an immense drawing was exhibited in 1791 alongside the Oath of the Horatii. As in the Oath of the Horatii, David conveys the unity of minds and bodies in the service of the patriotic ideal. But in this drawing, he takes the subject further, uniting the people beyond just family ties and across different classes, religions, and philosophical opinions. Ave Caesar Morituri te Salutant, by Jean-L√©on G√©r√¥me (1859)After the republican government was replaced by Napoleon's imperial r√©gime, David further deployed the gesture in The Distribution of the Eagle Standards (1810).Winkler (2009), p. 51 But unlike his previous paintings representing republican ideals, in Eagle Standards the oath of allegiance is pledged to a central authority figure, and in imperial fashion. Boime sees the series of oath pictures as \\"the coding of key developments in the history of the Revolution and its culmination in Napoleonic authoritarianism\\". The imperial oath is seen in other paintings, such as Jean-L√©on G√©r√¥me's Ave Caesar! Morituri te salutant (Hail, Caesar, those who are about to die salute you) of 1859.Winkler (2009), p. 40 In this painting, the gladiators are all raising their right or left arms, holding tridents and other weapons. Their salutation is a well-known Latin phrase quoted in Suetonius, De Vita Caesarum (\\"The Life of the Caesars\\", or \\"The Twelve Caesars\\").Suetonius, De Vita Caesarum: Divus Claudius, 21.6 Despite becoming widely popularised in later times, the phrase is unknown in Roman history aside from this isolated use, and it is questionable whether it was ever a customary salute, as is often believed. It was more likely to be an isolated appeal by desperate captives and criminals condemned to die. 19th‚Äì20th centuries United States Children performing the Bellamy salute to the flag of the United States On October 12, 1892, the Bellamy salute was demonstrated as the hand gesture to accompany the Pledge of Allegiance in the United States. The inventor of the saluting gesture was James B. Upham, junior partner and editor of The Youth's Companion. Bellamy recalled Upham, upon reading the pledge, came into the posture of the salute, snapped his heels together, and said \\"Now up there is the flag; I come to salute; as I say 'I pledge allegiance to my flag,' I stretch out my right hand and keep it raised while I say the stirring words that follow.\\" As fascism took hold in Europe, controversy grew on the use of the Bellamy salute given its similarity to the Roman Salute. When war broke out in 1939, the controversy intensified. School boards around the country revised the salute to avoid the similarity. There was a counter-backlash from the United States Flag Association and the Daughters of the American Revolution, who felt it inappropriate for Americans to have to change the traditional salute because aliens had later adopted a similar gesture. On June 22, 1942, at the urging of the American Legion and the Veterans of Foreign Wars, Congress passed Public Law 77-623, which codified the etiquette used to display and pledge allegiance to the flag. This included use of the Bellamy salute, specifically that the pledge \\"be rendered by standing with the right hand over the heart; extending the right hand, palm upward, toward the flag at the words ‚Äò‚Äòto the flag‚Äô‚Äô and holding this position until the end, when the hand drops to the side.\\" Congress did not discuss or take into account the controversy over use of the salute. Congress later amended the code on December 22, 1942 when it passed Public Law 77-829. Among other changes, it eliminated the Bellamy salute and replaced it with the stipulation that the pledge \\"be rendered by standing with the right hand over the heart.\\" Early 20th century in theatre and film The gesture, already established in the United States through the Bellamy salute, has been traced to the Broadway production of the play Ben-Hur.Winkler (2009), p. 70 The play, based on Lew Wallace's book Ben-Hur: A Tale of the Christ, opened on Broadway in November 1899 and proved to be a great success.Winkler (2009), p. 71 Photographs show several scenes using the gesture, including one of Ben-Hur greeting a seated sheik and another of a small crowd so greeting Ben-Hur in his chariot.Winkler (2009), p. 73 Neither Wallace's novel nor text for the theatrical production mentions a raised arm salute. The salute was evidently added in keeping with the exaggerated style of acting in 19th century theater, which in turn influenced acting in the silent cinema.Winkler (2009), p. 75 The salute frequently occurs in early 20th century films set in antiquity, such as the American Ben-Hur (1907) and the Italian Nerone (1908), although such films do not yet standardize it or make it exclusively Roman. In Spartaco (1914), even the slave Spartacus uses it. Later examples appear in Ben-Hur (1925) and in Cecil B. DeMille's Sign of the Cross (1932) and Cleopatra (1934), although the execution of the gesture is still variable. Of special note is the use in Giovanni Pastrone's colossal epic Cabiria (1914).Winkler (2009), pp. 94‚Äì95 Its intertitles, character names, and movie title were attributed to Italian nationalist Gabriele d'Annunzio, who was known as the \\"poet-warrior\\".Leeden (2001), p. 67 Inspired by the Italo-Turkish War, in which Italy conquered the North African Ottoman province of Tripolitania, Pastrone perused a politically volatile issue. The film highlights Italy's Roman past and the \\"monstrous\\" nature of Carthaginian society, which is contrasted with the \\"nobility\\" of Roman society. Cabiria was one of several films of the period that \\"helped resuscitate a distant history that legitimized Italy's past and inspired its dreams\\" and which \\"delivered the spirit for conquest that seemed to arrive from the distant past\\", thereby presaging the \\"political rituals of fascism\\", \\"thanks ... to its prime supporter and apostle, Gabriele d'Annunzio.\\" Variations on the salute occur throughout Cabiria on the part of Romans and Africans.Winkler (2009), p. 99 Scipio uses the gesture once. Fulvius Axilla, the story's fictitious hero, twice employs it as a farewell greeting to his hosts. The Numidian king Massinissa, guest of the Carthaginian Hasdrubal, raises his right hand and is so greeted in return, once by the strongman Maciste. Princess Sophonisba and King Syphax mutually greet each other by raising their hands and declining their bodies. The diversity of the gesture and the variety of nationalities who use it in Cabria is seen as further evidence that the salute is a modern invention, used in the film to highlight the exotic nature of antiquity. Adoption during the 20th century = Italy = Benito Mussolini and Hitler, Mussolini giving the Roman salute, 25 October 1936 D'Annunzio, who had written the subtitles for the silent movie epic Cabiria, appropriated the salute when he occupied Fiume in 1919.Falasca- Zamponi (2000), p. 110 D'Annunzio has been described as the John the Baptist of Italian Fascism,Leeden (2001), p. xiii as virtually the entire ritual of Fascism was invented by D'Annunzio during his occupation of Fiume and his leadership of the \\"Italian Regency of Carnaro\\". Besides the Roman salute, these included the balcony address, the cries of \\"Eia, eia, eia! Alal√†!\\", the dramatic and rhetorical dialogues with the crowd, and the use of religious symbols in new secular settings. Like other neo-Imperial rituals utilized by D'Annunzio, the salute became part of the Italian fascist movement's symbolic repertoire. On January 31, 1923, the Ministry of Education instituted a ritual honoring the flag in schools using the Roman salute. In 1925, as Mussolini began his fascitization of the state, the salute was gradually adopted by the regime, and by December 1, 1925 all state civil administrators were required to use it. Achille Starace, the Italian Fascist Party secretary, pushed for measures to make the use of the Roman salute generally compulsory, denouncing hand shaking as bourgeois. He further extolled the salute as \\"more hygienic, more aesthetic, and shorter.\\" He also suggested that the Roman salute did not imply the necessity of taking off the hat unless one was indoors. By 1932, the salute was adopted as the substitute for the handshake. On August 19, 1933 the military was ordered to use the salute whenever an unarmed detachment of soldiers was called on to render military honors for the King or Mussolini. The symbolic value of the gesture grew, and it was felt that the proper salute \\"had the effect of showing the fascist man's decisive spirit, which was close to that of ancient Rome\\".Falasca-Zamponi (2000), pp. 110‚Äì111 The salute was seen to demonstrate the fascist's \\"decisive spirit, firmness, seriousness, and acknowledgment and acceptance of the regime's hierarchical structure\\".Falasca- Zamponi (2000), pp. 112‚Äì113 It was further felt that the correct physical gesture brought forth a change in character.Falasca-Zamponi110 (2000), pp. 113 A joke claimed, however, that the Fascist salute used one hand because Italians were tired of raising both hands to surrender during World War I. The bourgeois gesture was supposed to disappear from the view of Italians and not contaminate their daily life. In 1938, the party abolished handshaking in films and theater, and on November 21, 1938 the Ministry of Popular Culture issued orders banning the publishing of photographs showing people shaking hands. Even official photographs of visiting dignitaries were retouched to remove the image of their handshaking. = Germany = In Germany, the salute, sporadically used by the Nazi Party (NSDAP) since 1923, was made compulsory within the movement in 1926.Kershaw (2001), p. 26 Called the Hitler salute (Hitlergru√ü), it functioned both as an expression of commitment within the party and as a demonstrative statement to the outside world.Tilman (2009), p. 55 Yet in spite of this demand for the outward display of obedience, the drive to gain acceptance did not go unchallenged, even within the movement. Early objections focused on its resemblance to the Roman salute employed by Fascist Italy, and hence on it not being Germanic. In response, efforts were made to establish its pedigree and invent a proper tradition after the fact. The compulsory use of the Hitler salute for all public employees followed a directive issued by Reich Minister of the Interior Wilhelm Frick on July 13, 1933, one day before the ban on all non-Nazi parties.Kershaw (2001), p. 60 The Wehrmacht refused to adopt the Hitler salute and was able for a time to maintain its own customs.Tilman (2009), pp. 80‚Äì82 The military were required to use the Hitler salute only while singing the Horst Wessel Lied and German national anthem, and in non-military encounters such as greeting members of the civilian government. Only after the July 20 Plot in 1944 were the military forces of the Third Reich ordered to replace the standard military salute with the Hitler salute.Tilman (2009), p. 82 = Elsewhere = Greek Parliament, 1938 Estonian Vaps Movement, 1933 Similar forms of salutes were adopted by various groups. Its use in France dates back to 1925, when the Jeunesses Patriotes (Patriotic Youth), a movement led by Pierre Taittinger, would give the fascist salute at meetings while shouting \\"Dictatorship!\\".Soucy (1997), p. 40 Marcel Bucard's Mouvement Franciste, founded in September 1933, adopted the salute as well as donning blue shirts and blue berets.Soucy (1997), p. 38‚Äì39 Solidarit√© Fran√ßaise used the salute as well, though its leaders denied the movement was fascist.Soucy (1997), p. 71 By 1937, rivalry amongst French right wing parties sometimes caused confusion over salutes.Soucy (1997), p. 142 The Parti Populaire Fran√ßais, generally regarded as the most pro-Nazi of France's collaborationist parties, adopted a variant of the salute that distinguished itself from others by slightly bending the hand and holding it at face level.Soucy (1997), p. 217 Integralists in Brazil, 1935 In the early 1930s, the salute was used by members of the Estonian nationalist right wing Vaps Movement, as well as the Brazilian Integralist Action, who used to salute by raising one arm. The Brazilian form of the Salute was called \\"Anau√™\\" ‚Äì a word used as a salutation and as a cry by the Brazilian indigenous Tupi people, meaning \\"you are my brother\\". Ante Paveliƒá greeting the Croatian parliament in February 1943 In Greece in 1936, when Ioannis Metaxas and his 4th of August Regime took power, an almost identical salute was adopted ‚Äì first by the National Youth Organization and later by the government as well as common people ‚Äì and used even while fighting against Italy and Germany in WW2. Francoist demonstration in Salamanca, Spain In Spain, on April 27, 1937, General Francisco Franco formally approved the salute in a decree which made it the official salutation to be used by all except the military, who would continue to use the traditional military salutes. This was repealed in September 1945.Decreto de la Presidencia del Consejo de Ministros derogando la obligatoriedad del saludo brazo en alto, de fecha 11 de septiembre de 1945, publicado en el B.O.E. n√∫m, 257 con fecha 14 de septiembre de 1945. When the Franco regime restored \\"Marcha Real\\" as the Spanish national anthem in 1942 and established unofficial new lyrics for it, the first stanza referred to the fascist salute: \\"Alzad los brazos, hijos del pueblo espa√±ol\\" (\\"Raise your arms, sons of the Spanish people\\"). These lyrics remained part of the Spanish national anthem until 1978. After a meeting with Mussolini, in December 1937, Yugoslav Prime Minister Milan Stojadinoviƒá and chairman of Yugoslav Radical Union adopted a version of the salute as he took to styling himself as Voƒëa (Leader). On January 4, 1939, the salute by raising one arm was adopted in Romania under a statute promulgating the National Renaissance Front. In Slovakia, the Hlinka Guard's Na str√°≈æ! (On guard!) consisted of a half-hearted compromise between a friendly wave and a salute with a straight raised arm. Post World War II =Italy= The salute has been used many times by prominent individuals as well as groups of people since the war. Famed poet Ezra Pound used the salute in praise of his adopted country of Italy when he returned in 1958 after being released from an insane asylum in America. The salute was on display in the 1968 funeral for Mussolini's youngest daughter, Anna Maria Mussolini Negri. When the Italian Social Movement had its greatest electoral gains since the Second World War in June, 1971, crowds at the party headquarters cheered and gave the outstretched arm salute. On July 29, 1983, on the 100th anniversary of Mussolini's birth, thousands of black-shirted supporters chanted \\"Duce! Duce!\\" with their arms raised in the fascist salute on a march from his native village of Predappio in Romagna to the cemetery where he was buried. On the eve of Silvio Berlusconi's election victory in 1994, young supporters of Gianfranco Fini made the fascist salute while chanting \\"Duce! Duce!\\" In 2005, Italian footballer Paolo Di Canio created controversy by twice using the gesture to salute S.S. Lazio fans, first in a match against archrivals A.S. Roma and then against A.S. Livorno Calcio (a club inclined to leftist politics). Di Canio received a one match game ban after the second event and was fined 7,000 euros, after which he was quoted as saying \\"I will always salute as I did because it gives me a sense of belonging to my people [...] I saluted my people with what for me is a sign of belonging to a group that holds true values, values of civility against the standardisation that this society imposes upon us.\\" His salute featured on unofficial merchandise sold outside Stadio Olimpico after the ban. Di Canio has also expressed admiration for Mussolini. In June, 2009, Michela Vittoria Brambilla, an Italian politician and businesswoman commonly described as a possible successor to Silvio Berlusconi for leadership of the Italian right, was caught in a controversy over her alleged use of the Roman salute, with calls for her to step down. She denied the accusation, stating \\"I've never either done or thought of doing any gesture that is an apology of fascism, something toward which I've never showed any indulgence, let alone sympathy. And why should I have made a public display of such a despicable gesture shortly after I've been made a minister?\\" A video of the event was posted on the Web site of the newspaper La Repubblica that showed Brambilla extending her right arm upward in what appears to be a fascist salute. Brambilla said she was just greeting the crowd. =Germany= Use of the salute and accompanying phrases has been forbidden by law in Germany since the end of World War II. Section 86a of the German Penal Code provides for punishment of up to three years in prison for anyone using the salute, unless it is used for artistic, scientific, or educational purposes.Tilman (2009), p. 94‚Äì95 =Greece= The Greek nationalist party Golden Dawn uses the Roman salute unofficially. Golden Dawn is accused by its opponents of being neo-Nazi, but the party denies this and claims that the salute is ancient Greek or Roman, and that it is used as a tribute to Ioannis Metaxas and his 4th of August Regime which led Greece against the foreign occupation forces in WWII. =The Levant= The salute employed by certain groups and their supporters, like Hezbollah, Fatah, pro-Assad NDFYouTube and Assad supporters,Yourmiddleeast.com the Syrian Social Nationalist Party, and the Kataeb Party,Thearabdigest.com have often been confused with the Roman/Nazi salute, even though in many cases the salute is performed by a closed fist rather than the Roman/Nazi extended palm. Opposition fighters in Syria have also been filmed and documenting using it, or a variance thereof, on multiple occasions.Rocklandtimes.com From its use, a connection between Nazism and these groups is often alleged . Often these allegations are raised at the expense of the opposing groups, pro-Assad sympathizers alleging Nazi sympathies of the Opposition and vice versa. However, the oath of allegiance by the Lebanese army, and the salute to the flag uses the Roman salute - possibly influenced by Vichy France shortly before independence was officially gained in 1944 - still continues to be used by the state today. =Portugal= In Portugal the salute is still used today by the military to take their oath to the national flag, when they successfully complete the first phase of military instruction. Formed in front of the highest symbol of national sovereignty, the military in sense and attunement, raise their right arm pointed towards the flag and take their oath. =South Africa= The Afrikaner Weerstandsbeweging, a neo-Nazi political party and paramilitary force known for its advocacy of an all-white Afrikaner Volkstaat,\\"Separation, even after apartheid; Many whites fear for life after Mandela,\\" (21 June 2013) National Post, Ontario\\"Extremists Steal Guns for S. Africa War\\" (May 30, 1990), Elyria Chronicle Telegram has utilized Nazi-style uniforms, flags, insignia, and salutes at meetings and public rallies.\\"Eugene Terre'Blanche's Afrikaner Resistance Movement - Rally,\\" youtube. See 0:40 for salutes. Hundreds of supporters in 2010 delivered straight-arm salutes outside the funeral for its founder and former leader Eug√®ne Terre'Blanche, who was murdered by two black farm workers over an alleged wage dispute. =Red Hand of Ulster Salute= The Red Hand of Ulster Salute is a modified version of the Roman Salute in which the hand is raised vertically to symbolise the Red Hand of Ulster. It is used by some Rangers F.C. fans to show an affinity with the Loyalist cause. Its similarity to the Nazi salute has caused offence and the football club and its supporters' association have asked them not to use it. =Popular culture= Stanford band members doing the Roman salute to the marching band of rival USC. A large number of films made after World War II made the Roman salute a visual stereotype of a proto-fascist ancient Roman society.Winkler (2009), p. 151 In the 1951 film Quo Vadis, Nero's repeated use of the salute at mass rallies explicitly presents the Roman Empire as a Fascist military state.Winkler (2009), p. 143‚Äì145 The movie provided other filmmakers of the time a model, with notable examples including Ben-Hur,Winkler (2009), p. 155 Spartacus,Winkler (2009), p.158 Cleopatra,Winkler (2009), p. 159 and Caligula. Not until Gladiator did the Roman epic return to the cinema.Winkler (2009), p. 164 In this movie, the salute is notably absent in most scenes, for example when Commodus enters Rome or when the Senate salutes the Emperor by head- bowing. Variations on the salute also appear in neo-fascist contexts. For example, The Christian Falangist Party, founded in 1985, uses a \\"pectoral salute\\", in which the right arm, bent at the elbow, is extended from the heart, palm down.Winkler (2009), p. 6 This gesture was used in Fran√ßois Truffaut's 1966 film Fahrenheit 451.Winkler (2009), p. 176 The film portrays a futuristic totalitarian society modeled after the fascist state, including black uniforms, book burnings, and thought control. In the Star Trek episode \\"Mirror, Mirror\\", the salute begins with the right fist being placed over the heart, as in a pectoral salute, and then the arm is stretched out (usually up) before the body, open palm down, as in a traditional Roman salute.Winkler (2009), p. 169 In the episode, Captain Kirk and members of his crew are transported to a parallel universe in which the United Federation of Planets has been replaced by an empire characterized by sadistic violence and torture, genocide, and unquestioning obedience to authority. A modified Roman salute is commonly used in the British-American series Rome.Winkler (2009), p. 174 Here the salute avoids similarity to the Fascist salute, as the series seeks not to depict these Romans as stereotypical conquerors. Therefore, the salute is not the familiar straight arm salute but rather resembles a pectoral salute, with the right hand is placed over the heart and then extended to the front of the body.

The National Association of Free Will Baptists traces its history in the United States through two different lines: one beginning in the South in 1727 (the \\"Palmer line\\") and another in the North in 1780 (the \\"Randall line\\"). The \\"Palmer line\\" however, never developed as a denomination. It consisted of only about three churches in North Carolina. The National Association of Free Will Baptists is the largest of the Free Will Baptist denominations. History In 1702, English General Baptists who had settled in the Province of Carolina requested help from the General Baptists in England. Though they did not receive help, native Paul Palmer labored there about 25 years later, and founded the first \\"General\\" or \\"Free Will\\" Baptist church in Chowan County, North Carolina, in 1727. (Many General Baptists held to general atonement but \\"personal predestination\\" or eternal security.) Palmer organized at least three churches in North Carolina. From one church in 1727, they grew to over 20 churches by 1755. After 1755, the churches began to decrease and many churches and members became Particular Baptists. By 1770, only four churches and four ministers remained of the General Baptist persuasion. By the end of the 18th century, these churches were being referred to as \\"Free Will Baptist.\\" The churches in the \\"Palmer\\" line would again experience growth slowly in the 19th century. They organized various associations and conferences, and finally organized into the General Conference of Free Will Baptists in 1921. The problem with the history of Paul Palmer, however, stems from the fact that it is uncertain exactly what view of perseverance he held. In fact, some church historians think he was Calvinistic in his views. He had come from the Welsh Tract Church which was Calvinistic. Another \\"Free Will\\" movement rose in the North through the work of Benjamin Randall (1749-1808). Randall united with the Regular Baptists in 1776, but broke with them in 1779 due to his more liberal views on predestination. In 1780, Randall formed a \\"Free\\" Baptist church in New Durham, New Hampshire. More churches were founded, and in 1792 a Yearly Meeting was organized. This northern line of Free Will Baptists expanded rapidly, but the majority of the churches merged with the Northern Baptist Convention in 1911. A remnant of the Randall churches organized in 1917 as the Cooperative General Association of Free Will Baptists. Representatives of the \\"Palmer\\" (General Conference) and \\"Randall\\" (Cooperative General Association) groups of Free Will Baptists met at Cofer's Chapel in Nashville, Tennessee, in 1935 and organized the National Association of Free Will Baptists as a merger of the two groups. The new association adopted the Treatise on the Faith and Practice of the Free Will Baptists, which has been revised several times since then. As of August 2005, the Association claims to have over 2,400 churches in 42 states and 14 foreign countries. The Association is actively involved in missionary work in the United States and throughout the world. The Association operates a publishing house called Randall House. Three colleges, Welch College (formerly the Free Will Baptist Bible College) in Nashville, Tennessee, Randall University (formerly known as Hillsdale Free Will Baptist College) in Moore, Oklahoma, and Southeastern Free Will Baptist College in Wendell, North Carolina are affiliated with the Association. Theology The churches of the National Association of Free Will Baptists are theological conservatives who hold an Arminian view of salvation, notably in the belief of conditional security and rejection of the belief of eternal security held by the larger body of Baptists. In addition, they differ from the larger body of Baptists in holding three ordinances rather than two to be practiced by the church; specifically, in addition Believer's Baptism and the Lord's supper held by the larger body of Baptists, they also practice the ordinance of washing of feet. In some churches, anointing with oil is also practiced. Membership Since the middle of the 20th century, membership has remained near 200,000. In 2007, the Association reported having 2,369 churches and 185,798 members. National Council of Churches' Historic Archive CD and Yearbook of American & Canadian Churches Membership is concentrated in the South. The states with the highest membership rates are Arkansas, Oklahoma, West Virginia, Alabama, and Kentucky. 2000 Religious Congregations and Membership Study References Sources  * External links *National Association of Free Will Baptists *Randall House Publishing *ONE Magazine: The Magazine for Free Will Baptists *A Treatise of the Faith and Practices of the National Association of Free Will Baptists *Profile of the National Association of Free Will Baptists on the Association of Religion Data Archives website Category:Arminian denominations Category:Baptist denominations in North America Category:Baptist Christianity in Tennessee Category:Free Will Baptists Category:Christian organizations established in 1935 Category:Baptist denominations established in the 20th century ","title":"National Association of Free Will Baptists"},{"id":"340477","text":"Patent drawing for Max Fleischer's original rotoscope. The artist is drawing on a transparent easel, onto which the movie projector at the right is beaming an image of a single movie frame. Rotoscoping is an animation technique that animators use to trace over motion picture footage, frame by frame, to produce realistic action. Originally, animators projected photographed live-action movie images onto a glass panel and traced over the image. This projection equipment is referred to as a rotoscope, developed by Polish-American animator Max Fleischer. This device was eventually replaced by computers, but the process is still called rotoscoping. In the visual effects industry, rotoscoping is the technique of manually creating a matte for an element on a live-action plate so it may be composited over another background.\\"Through a 'Scanner' dazzlingly: Sci-fi brought to graphic life\\" USA TODAY, August 2, 2006 Wednesday, LIFE; Pg. 4D WebLink Chroma key is more often used for this, as it is faster and requires less work, however rotoscopy is still used on subjects that aren't in front of a green (or blue) screen, due to practical or economic reasons. Technique A modern GIF of a horse's gallop, traced from a series of photographs by Eadweard Muybridge Modern animation of traced images from Eadweard Muybridge's Horse in Motion engraved into twenty metal discs Rotoscoping has often been used as a tool for visual effects in live- action movies. By tracing an object, the moviemaker creates a silhouette (called a matte) that can be used to extract that object from a scene for use on a different background. While blue- and green-screen techniques have made the process of layering subjects in scenes easier, rotoscoping still plays a large role in the production of visual effects imagery. Rotoscoping in the digital domain is often aided by motion-tracking and onion-skinning software. Rotoscoping is often used in the preparation of garbage mattes for other matte-pulling processes. Rotoscoping has also been used to create a special visual effect (such as a glow, for example) that is guided by the matte or rotoscoped line. A classic use of traditional rotoscoping was in the original three Star Wars movies, where the production used it to create the glowing lightsaber effect with a matte based on sticks held by the actors. To achieve this, effects technicians traced a line over each frame with the prop, then enlarged each line and added the glow. History =Predecessors= Eadweard Muybridge had some of his famous chronophotographic sequences painted on glass discs for the zoopraxiscope projector that he used in his popular lectures between 1880 and 1895. The first discs were painted on the glass in dark contours. Discs made between 1892 and 1894 had outlines drawn by Erwin Faber photographically printed on the disc and then coloured by hand, but these discs were probably never used in the lectures.http://www.stephenherbert.co.uk/muy%20blog3.htm#part15 By 1902, Nuremberg toy companies Gebr√ºder Bing and Ernst Plank were offering chromolithographed film loops for their toy kinematographs. The films were traced from live-action film footage. =Early works and Fleischer's exclusivity= The rotoscope technique was invented by animator Max Fleischer in 1915, and used in his groundbreaking Out of the Inkwell animated series (1918‚Äì1927). It was known simply as the \\"Fleischer Process\\" on the early screen credits, and was essentially exclusive to Fleischer for several years. The live-movie reference for the character, later known as Koko the Clown, was performed by his brother (Dave Fleischer) dressed in a clown costume. Originally conceived as a short-cut to animating, the rotoscope process proved time-consuming due to the precise and laborious nature of tracing. Rotoscoping is achieved by two methods, rear projection and front surface projection. In either case, the results can have slight deviations from the true line due to the separation of the projected image and the surface used for tracing. Misinterpretations of the forms cause the line to wiggle, and the roto tracings must be reworked over an animation disc, using the tracings as a guide where consistency and solidity are important. Fleischer ceased to depend on the rotoscope for fluid action by 1924, when Dick Huemer became the animation director and brought his animation experience from his years on the Mutt and Jeff series. Fleischer returned to rotoscoping in the 1930s for referencing intricate dance movements in his Popeye and Betty Boop cartoons. The most notable of these are the dance routines originating from jazz performer Cab Calloway in Minnie the Moocher (1932), Snow White (1933), and The Old Man of the Mountain (1933). In these examples, the roto tracing were used as a guide for timing and positioning, while the cartoon characters of different proportions were drawn to conform to those positions. Fleischer's last applications of rotoscope were for the realistic human animation required for the lead character‚Äîamong others‚Äîin Gulliver's Travels (1939), and the human characters in his last feature, Mr. Bug Goes to Town (1941). His most effective use of rotoscoping was in the action-oriented film noir Superman series of the early 1940s, where realistic movement was achieved on a level unmatched by conventional cartoon animation. Contemporary uses of the rotoscope and its inherent challenges have included surreal effects in music videos such as Elvis Costello's \\"Accidents Will Happen\\" (1978), Klaatu's \\"Routine Day\\" (1979), A-ha's \\"Take On Me\\" (1985), the live performance scenes in Dire Straits' \\"Money for Nothing\\" (1985), Kansas' \\"All I Wanted\\" (1986), and the animated TV series Delta State (2004). =Uses by other studios= Fleischer's patent expired by 1934, and other producers could then use rotoscoping freely. Walt Disney and his animators used the technique in Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs during 1937.\\"Reviving an ancient art\\" The Times (London), August 5, 2006, FEATURES; The Knowledge; Pg. 10. Weblink, see bottom of page Leon Schlesinger Productions, which produced the Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies cartoons for Warner Bros., occasionally used rotoscoping. The 1939 MGM cartoon \\"Petunia Natural Park\\" from The Captain and the Kids featured a rotoscope version of Jackie. Rotoscoping was used extensively in China's first animated feature film, Princess Iron Fan (1941), which was released under very difficult conditions during the Second Sino-Japanese War and World War II. Most of the movies produced with it were adaptations of folk tales or poems‚Äîfor example, The Night Before Christmas or The Tale of the Fisherman and the Fish. Only during the early 1960s, after the \\"Khrushchev Thaw\\", did animators start to explore very different aesthetics. The makers of the Beatles' Yellow Submarine used rotoscoping in the \\"Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds\\" sequence. Director Martin Scorsese used rotoscoping to remove a large chunk of cocaine hanging from Neil Young's nose in his rock documentary The Last Waltz. Ralph Bakshi used rotoscoping extensively for his animated features Wizards (1977), The Lord of the Rings (1978), American Pop (1981), and Fire and Ice (1983). Bakshi first used rotoscoping because 20th Century Fox refused his request for a $50,000 budget increase to finish Wizards; he resorted to the rotoscope technique to finish the battle sequences.Ralph Bakshi: The Wizard of Animation making-of documentary.Bakshi, Ralph. Wizards DVD, 20th Century Fox Home Entertainment, 2004, audio commentary. ASIN: B0001NBMIK Rotoscoping was also used in Tom Waits For No One (1979) a short film made by John Lamb, Heavy Metal (1981), What Have We Learned, Charlie Brown? (1983) and It's Flashbeagle, Charlie Brown (1984); the Dire Straits ‚ÄúBrothers in Arms‚Äù (1985), three of A-ha's music videos, \\"Take On Me\\" (1985), \\"The Sun Always Shines on T.V.\\" (1985), and \\"Train of Thought\\" (1986); Don Bluth's The Secret of NIMH (1982), An American Tail (1986), Harry and the Hendersons (closing credits), The BFG (1989), Titan A.E. (2000); and Nina Paley's Sita Sings the Blues (2008). During 1994, Smoking Car Productions invented a digital rotoscoping process to develop its critically acclaimed adventure video game The Last Express. The process was awarded , Digital Cartoon and Animation Process. The game was designed by Jordan Mechner, who had used rotoscoping extensively in his previous games Karateka and Prince of Persia. During the mid-1990s, Bob Sabiston, an animator and computer scientist veteran of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) Media Lab, developed a computer-assisted \\"interpolated rotoscoping\\" process, which he used to make his award-winning short movie \\"Snack and Drink\\". Director Richard Linklater subsequently employed Sabiston and his proprietary Rotoshop software in the full-length feature movies Waking Life (2001) and A Scanner Darkly (2006). Linklater licensed the same proprietary rotoscoping process for the look of both movies. Linklater was the first director to use digital rotoscoping to create an entire feature movie. Additionally, a 2005‚Äì08 advertising campaign by Charles Schwab used Sabiston's rotoscoping work for a series of television commercials, with the tagline \\"Talk to Chuck\\". The Simpsons used rotoscope as a couch gag in the episode Barthood, with Lisa describing it as \\"a noble experiment that failed\\". During 2013, the anime The Flowers of Evil used rotoscoping to produce a look that differed greatly from its manga source material. Viewers criticized the show's shortcuts in facial animation, its reuse of backgrounds, and the liberties it took with realism. Despite this, critics lauded the movie, and the website Anime News Network awarded it a perfect score for initial reactions. In early 2015, an anime film titled The Case of Hana & Alice (animated prequel to the 2004 live-action film, Hana and Alice) was entirely animated with rotoscoping, but it was far better-received than The Flowers of Evil, with critics praising its rotoscoping. In 2015, ', a short-form horror anime series using rotoscoping, aired on Japanese TV. Undone (2019‚Äì), an Amazon Prime original series, was created using the technique.

It is commonly used in database marketing and direct marketing and has received particular attention in retail and professional services industries.Fader, P. S., Hardie, B. G., & Lee, K. L. (2005). RFM and CLV: Using iso-value curves for customer base analysis. Journal of Marketing Research, 42(4), 415-430. RFM stands for the three dimensions: *Recency ‚Äì How recently did the customer purchase? *Frequency ‚Äì How often do they purchase? *Monetary Value ‚Äì How much do they spend? Customer purchases may be represented by a table with columns for the customer name, date of purchase and purchase value. One approach to RFM is to assign a score for each dimension on a scale from 1 to 10. The maximum score represents the preferred behavior and a formula could be used to calculate the three scores for each customer. For example, a service-based business could use these calculations: * Recency = the maximum of \\"10 ‚Äì the number of months that have passed since the customer last purchased\\" and 1 * Frequency = the maximum of \\"the number of purchases by the customer in the last 12 months (with a limit of 10)\\" and 1 * Monetary = the highest value of all purchases by the customer expressed as a multiple of some benchmark value Alternatively, categories can be defined for each attribute. For instance, Recency might be broken into three categories: customers with purchases within the last 90 days; between 91 and 365 days; and longer than 365 days. Such categories may be derived from business rules or using data mining techniques to find meaningful breaks. Once each of the attributes has appropriate categories defined, segments are created from the intersection of the values. If there were three categories for each attribute, then the resulting matrix would have twenty-seven possible combinations (one well-known commercial approach uses five bins per attributes, which yields 125 segments). Companies may also decide to collapse certain subsegments, if the gradations appear too small to be useful. The resulting segments can be ordered from most valuable (highest recency, frequency, and value) to least valuable (lowest recency, frequency, and value). Identifying the most valuable RFM segments can capitalize on chance relationships in the data used for this analysis. For this reason, it is highly recommended that another set of data be used to validate the results of the RFM segmentation process. Advocates of this technique point out that it has the virtue of simplicity: no specialized statistical software is required, and the results are readily understood by business people. In the absence of other targeting techniques, it can provide a lift in response rates for promotions. Variations RFD ‚Äì Recency, Frequency, Duration is a modified version of RFM analysis that can be used to analyze consumer behavior of viewership/readership/surfing oriented business products. (For example, amount of time spent by surfers on Wikipedia) RFE ‚Äì Recency, Frequency, Engagement is a broader version of the RFD analysis, where Engagement can be defined to include visit duration, pages per visit or other such metrics. RFM-I ‚Äì Recency, Frequency, Monetary Value ‚Äì Interactions is a version of RFM framework modified to account for recency and frequency of marketing interactions with the client (e.g. to control for possible deterring effects of very frequent advertising engagements).Tkachenko, Yegor.

Russell, pg.1 & 318 also known as C. M. Russell, Charlie Russell, and \\"Kid\\" Russell, was an American artist of the American Old West. He created more than 2,000 paintings of cowboys, Native Americans, and landscapes set in the western United States and in Alberta, Canada, in addition to bronze sculptures. He is known as \\"the cowboy artist\\" and was also a storyteller and author. He became an advocate for Native Americans in the west, supporting the bid by landless Chippewa to have a reservation established for them in Montana. In 1916, Congress passed legislation to create the Rocky Boy Reservation. The C. M. Russell Museum Complex in Great Falls, Montana houses more than 2,000 Russell artworks, personal objects, and artifacts. Other major collections are held at the Montana Historical Society in Helena, Montana, the Buffalo Bill Center of the West in Cody, Wyoming, the Amon Carter Museum of American Art in Fort Worth, Texas, and the Sid Richardson Museum in Fort Worth. His mural Lewis and Clark Meeting the Flathead Indians hangs in the state capitol building in Helena, and his 1918 painting Piegans sold for $5.6 million at a 2005 auction. In 1955, he was inducted into the Hall of Great Westerners of the National Cowboy & Western Heritage Museum.  Childhood  Smoke of a .45, oil on canvas, 1908 When The Land Belonged to God, 1914, replica image displayed for many years in the Montana Senate Lewis and Clark Meeting the Flathead Indians, 1912, displayed behind the speaker's chair in the Montana House of Representatives Art was always a part of Russell's life. Growing up in Missouri, he drew sketches and made clay figures of animals. Russell had an intense interest in the \\"wild west\\" and would spend hours reading about it. Russell would watch explorers and fur traders who frequently came through Missouri. He learned to ride horses at Hazel Dell Farm near Jerseyville, Illinois, on a famous Civil War horse named Great Britain. Russell's instructor was Col. William H. Fulkerson, who had married into the Russell family. At the age of sixteen, Russell left school and went to Montana to work on a sheep ranch.  Montana and the West  Russell left the sheep ranch and found work with Jake Hoover, a hunter and trapper who had become a rancher. He owned land in the Judith Basin. Russell learned much about the ways of the West from him, and the two men remained lifelong friends. After a brief visit in 1882 to his family in Missouri, Russell returned to Montana, and lived and worked there for the remainder of his life. He worked as a cowboy for a number of outfits, and documented the harsh winter of 1886‚Äì1887 in a number of watercolors. Russell was working on the O-H Ranch in the Judith Basin of Central Montana at the time. The ranch foreman received a letter from the owner, asking how the cattle herd had weathered the winter. In reply, the foreman sent a postcard-sized watercolor that Russell had painted of a gaunt steer being watched by wolves under a gray winter sky. The ranch owner showed the postcard to friends and business acquaintances, and eventually displayed it in a shop window in Helena, Montana. After this, the artist began to receive commissions for new work. Russell's caption on the sketch, Waiting for a Chinook, became the title of the watercolor. Russell later painted a more detailed version of the scene which became one of his best-known works. Beginning in 1888, Russell spent a period living with the Blood Indians, a branch of the Blackfeet nation. Scholars believe that he gained much of his intimate knowledge of Native American culture during this period. When he returned to the Judith Basin in 1889, he found it filling with settlers. He worked in more open places for a couple of years before settling in the area of Great Falls, Montana, in 1892. There he worked to make a living as a full-time artist. In 1896, Russell married his wife Nancy. He was 32 and she was 18. In 1897, they moved from the small community of Cascade, Montana to the bustling county seat of Great Falls. Russell spent the majority of the remainder of his life there. He continued with his art, becoming a local celebrity and gaining the acclaim of critics worldwide. As Russell was not skilled in marketing his work, Nancy is generally given credit for making him an internationally known artist. She set up many shows for Russell throughout the United States and in London, creating many followers of Russell. In 1912 he joined cowboy artist Frank Tenney Johnson on a sketching expedition to the Blackfoot Reservation east of Glacier National Park in Montana.https://sidrichardsonmuseum.org/collection/trouble- on-the-pony-express/ In 1913, Russell painted Wild Horse Hunters, which depicts riders capturing wild horses, each band of which is dominated by a stallion. He used as much color as an artist could on his mountain landscapes.Russell exhibit, Amon Carter Museum, Fort Worth, Texas As an artist, Russell emerged at a time when the Wild West was of intense interest to people who lived in cities, and cattle drives were still being conducted over long distances. He painted images of the Old West that were later adopted by Westerns, which became a movie staple. Russell was fond of these popular art forms and made many friends among the well-off collectors of his works, including actors and film makers such as William S. Hart, Harry Carey, Will Rogers, and Douglas Fairbanks. Russell also kept up with fellow artists of the West, including painter Edgar Samuel Paxson, painter Edward \\"Ed\\" Borein and Will Crawford the illustrator. On the day of Russell's funeral in 1926, the children in Great Falls were released from school so they could watch the funeral procession. Russell's coffin was displayed in a glass-sided coach, pulled by four black horses.Taliaferro, John Charles M. Russell: The Life and Legend of America's Cowboy Artist, University of Oklahoma Press, 2003 p. 264 Russell produced about 4000 works of art, including oil and watercolor paintings, drawings and sculptures in wax, clay, plaster and other materials, some of which were also cast in bronze.

Along with Jeannette Rankin, the first female member of the United States Congress, Russell represents Montana in the National Statuary Hall Collection in the United States Capitol. In 1960, Charles M. Russell Elementary School was built in Missoula, Montana. In 1965, a high school was built on the north side of the Missouri River in Great Falls, Montana and named Charles M. Russell High School, in honor of Russell. Ian Tyson's 1987 album, Cowboyography, includes a song titled \\"The Gift\\" telling the story of Russell. Michael Nesmith, of Monkees fame, recorded a song titled \\"Laugh Kills Lonesome\\" which was inspired by, and describes the contents of, a well-known Russell painting of the same name. Native Blackfeet folk singer Jack Gladstone wrote a song dedicated to Russell titled \\"When the Land Belonged to God.\\" The song describes Russell's painting of the same name. In 1985, Russell was inducted into the Society of Illustrators Hall of Fame in New York.https://www.societyillustrators.org/programs/hall-fame In 1991, Russell was inducted into the St. Louis Walk of Fame. Some of Russell's paintings were shown during the credits of the ABC television series How the West Was Won, starring James Arness. James McDowell Sr. of Tulsa, Oklahoma donated 24 volumes of his illustrations to the Western History Collections at the University of Oklahoma in 1997.Russell Artwork Donated to OU (January 17, 1997), Tulsa World (Oklahoma), page D3.

His 1892 oil painting Water for Camp (depicting Native American women dipping pots into a stream) and his 1924 watercolor A Dangerous Sport (in which two cowboys lasso a mountain lion) sold for nearly $1.5 million each. A collection of 30 pieces of Russell's art were sold for several million dollars at the Coeur d'Alene Art Auction (held in Reno, Nevada) in July 2014, setting new records for many pieces. Russell's Trail of the Iron Horse watercolor (depicting a group of horseback Native Americans contemplating railroad track) sold for $1.9 million, while Dakota Chief (which depicts a young Lakota chieftain on horseback) was auctioned for $1.1 million (almost double the last price it commanded). Even small pencil sketches sold for $25,000. In popular culture Robert Taylor hosted and portrayed Russell in a 1967 episode, \\"A Wrangler's Last Ride\\" on the syndicated anthology series, Death Valley Days. In this episode, Russell gives up being a cowboy to become a full-time painter. Susan Brown was cast as Nancy Cooper, whom Russell married. There is a reference to a painting by Russell in the Season 3 episode \\"Explosion! Part 2\\" of The Big Valley when Jarrod Barkley uncovers a painting titled Jerked Down. The painting wasn't painted until 1907 while the television series supposedly takes place in the late 1800s Stockton, California region. The episode originally aired November 27, 1967. Fess Parker portrayed Charlie Russell in an unaired Pilot TV show titled ‚ÄúRussell‚Äù. It can be seen on Bob Terry‚Äôs anthology of The Forsaken Westerns. Russell‚Äôs ‚ÄúInnocent Allies‚Äù is featured. In the pilot Charlie is working as a ranch hand and wrangler when he witnesses a stage coach holdup. He befriends a woman passenger, played by Beverly Garland, who has just purchased a local saloon. It is not clear when this pilot was made but it was likely before Parker‚Äôs Daniel Boone and after his Davey Crocket series. At the end of the show we are shown several of Russell‚Äôs greatest works.  Notable works  The Bucker, 1904, Watercolor, pencil & gouache on paper, Sid Richardson Museum, Fort Worth, Texas Buccaroos, 1902 Russell's works comprised a wide variety of topics, including major historical events and everyday life in the west. His work was noted for the frequency with which he portrayed well-known events from the point of view of Native American people instead of the non-Native viewpoint. He was noted for a keen eye on the social undercurrents of society and the meticulous authenticity with which he portrayed the clothing and equipment of both cowboys and Native people. Historians studying women's roles in the West have critiqued Russell's portrayal of women. They note the contrasting levels of sensuality in his depictions of white and native women, as he seemed to transfer sexuality from white to Native women, so as to conform to the moral standards and perceptions of women in his time. Most of Russell's portrayals of white women are shown as \\"pure\\" and non-sexual, other than those paintings specifically depicting prostitutes. In contrast, his series of five Keeoma paintings and related images show a sensual native woman. They are documented by the statement that Keeoma was a real woman whom Russell had loved. Photographs exist that show the body model for these images was Russell's wife, Nancy. Critics say that by serving as a model, she could express her sexuality in a way generally not allowed \\"decent\\" white women of the time. Timothy Egan, in his 1998 book Lasso the Wind, quotes Russell as saying, \\"In my book a pioneer is a man who turned all the grass upside down, strung bob- wire over the dust that was left, poisoned the water, cut down the trees, killed the Indian who owned the land and called it progress.\\"cited in \\"The Rape of the West\\", by Timothy Foote, New York Times, 6 September 1998 =Cowboy life= File:LaughKillsLonesome.jpgLaugh Kills Lonesome, oil on canvas, 1925.

A free kick is an action used in several codes of football to restart play with the kicking of a ball into the field of play.  Association football  In association football, the free kick is a method of restarting the game following an offence by the opposing side. For more serious offences, such as handball or serious foul play. a direct free kick is awarded, from which a goal may be scored directly against the opposing side. (If such an offence is committed in a team's own penalty area, a penalty kick is awarded instead). For less serious offences, such as offside, an indirect free kick is awarded, from which the ball must touch another player before a goal is scored.  American football  In American football, after a safety is scored, the ball is put into play by a free kick. The team that was scored upon must kick the ball from their own 20-yard line and can punt, drop kick, or place kick the ball. In professional play, a kicking tee cannot be used ‚Äì however, a tee can be used in high school or college football. Once the ball has been kicked, it can be caught and advanced by any member of the receiving team, and it can be recovered by the kicking team if the ball travels at least 10 yards and bounces at least once or a player of the receiving team touches the ball.NFL Rules 2012, pp. 29-30.NCAA Rule, 52-53NFHS Rules 2012, pp. 15, 46, 52-53. In Canadian football, after scoring a safety touch, the scoring team has the option of taking control of the ball and beginning play from their own 35-yard line, kicking the ball off from their 35-yard line, or accepting a kickoff from the 25-yard line of the team that conceded the score.CFL Rules 2011, p. 29. If a kickoff is chosen it must be a place kick, and the ball can be held, placed on the ground, or placed on a tee prior to the kick. As in American football, the ball must go at least ten yards before it can be recovered by the kicking team.CFL Rules 2011, pp. 36-39. Another example occurring in American football is the fair catch kick, a field goal attempted freely from the spot of a fair catch. Although the National Football League (NFL) does not consider the play a free kick, the National Federation of State High School Associations (NFHS) and media analysts regard it as being a free kick. The kick must be either a place kick or a drop kick, and if it passes over the crossbar and between the goalposts of the defensive team's goal, a field goal, worth three points, is scored to the offensive team. Under NFHS rules, kickoffs are also classified as free kicks. Australian rules football A free kick in Australian rules football is awarded after a player commits a penalty. The player must then kick the ball back to the other team. When a free kick is awarded, the player's opponent stands the mark, standing on the spot where the umpire indicates that the free kick was paid or mark was taken. The player with the ball then retreats backwards so that the ball can be kicked over the player standing the mark; the player must retreat on the angle such that he, the man on the mark and the centre of the attacking goal are in the same straight line. Rugby union A free kick in rugby union is usually awarded to a team for a technical offence committed by the opposing side. Once awarded a free kick, the team must decide how they wish to play it. Options include choosing to play a place kick, drop kick, punt, or take it as a scrum.

Description  Vaccinium macrocarpon is a shrub, often ascending (trailing along the surface of the ground for some distance but then curving upwards). It produces white or pink flowers followed by sour-tasting red or pink berries across.Flora of North America, Vaccinium macrocarpon Aiton, 1789.

Hortus Kewensis, or, A catalogue of the plants cultivated in the Royal Botanic Garden at Kew 2: 13 and plate 7 description in Latin on page 13; full-page color illustration on plate 7 (between pages 12 and 13)  Distribution  Vaccinium macrocarpon is native to central and eastern Canada (Ontario to Newfoundland) and the northeastern and north-central United States (Northeast, Great Lakes Region, and Appalachians as far south as North Carolina and Tennessee). It is also naturalized in parts of Europe and scattered locations in North America along western Canada (British Columbia) and the western United States (West Coast).  Human uses  The species is grown commercially as a cash crop for its edible berries. Many of these are grown in artificial ponds called cranberry bogs.University of Massachusetts, Natural History of the American Cranberry, Vaccinium macrocarpon Ait. There is some evidence suggesting that the berries or their juice could be useful in treating or preventing certain urinary tract infections, but this is not certain yet and thus is not a substitute for medical management.Wang C, Fang C, Chen N, et al.

It is used in the United States and Canada as a rejection term and an infection tag game (such as Humans vs. Zombies). It is similar to the British 'dreaded lurgi', and to terms used in the Nordic countries, in Italy, Australia and New Zealand. A child is said to \\"catch\\" cooties through close contact with an \\"infected\\" person or from an opposite-sex child of a similar age. Origin The word is thought to originate from the Austronesian language family, in which the Philippine languages, Maori and Malaysian- Indonesian word kutu refers to a parasitic biting insect.Oxford English Dictionary However, it is equally likely the name originated from \\"cuties\\", a cynical reference to the same. The earliest recorded uses of the term in English are by British soldiers during the First World War to refer to lice that proliferated in battlefield trenches. 1898 use of the term in English can be found in \\"My Life and an Era\\", The Autobiography of Buck Colbert Franklin. copyright 1997 by Louisiana State University Press. and ISBN 0-8071-2599. South Bend News-Times, April 7, 1922 A hand-held game, the Cootie Game, was made by the Irvin-Smith Company of Chicago in 1915; it involved tilting capsules (the cooties) into a trap over a background illustration depicting a battlefield. Other cootie games followed, all involving some form of \\"bug\\" or \\"cootie\\", until The Game of Cootie was launched in 1948 by Schaper Toys. This game was very successful, becoming an icon; in 2003, the Toy Industry Association included it on its \\"Century of Toys List\\" of the 100 most memorable and most creative toys of the 20th century. In addition to the cooties games, the term cooties was popularised in America in the 1950s by military personnel coming back from service alongside the British in the South Pacific. Like the British 'dreaded lurgi', the cooties games developed during the early 1950s polio epidemic, and became associated with dirt and contagion. Other terms The lice of the First World War trenches nicknamed \\"cooties\\" were also known as \\"arithmetic bugs\\" because \\"they added to our troubles, subtracted from our pleasures, divided our attention, and multiplied like hell.\\" In Italy, children have the term la peste (\\"the plague\\"). Cooties are known in Denmark as pigelus and drengelus and in Norway as jentelus and guttelus: each pair meaning literally \\"girl lice\\" and \\"boy lice\\". In Sweden they are known as tjejbaciller and killbaciller (literally \\"girl/boy bacilli\\") and in Finland they are known as the tytt√∂bakteeri and poikabakteeri (\\"girl/boy bacteria\\"). In Serbia the game is known as ≈°uga; the word means scabies. Cooties game A child is said to \\"catch\\" cooties through any form of bodily contact, proximity, or touching of an \\"infected\\" person or from a person of the opposite sex of the same age. Often the \\"infected\\" person is someone who is perceived as different, due to disability, shyness, being of the opposite sex, or having peculiar mannerisms. The phrase is most commonly used by children in elementary school aged from four to 10; however, it may be used by older children in a sarcastic or playful way. Sometimes the phrase specifies the type of cooties, as in \\"you've got girl cooties!\\" or \\"you've got boy cooties!\\" after a child has been touched by or in other ways interacted with a child of the opposite sex. Boys are more likely to accuse girls of having cooties than vice versa. In the United States, children sometimes \\"immunize\\" one another from cooties by administering a \\"cootie injection\\". Typically, one child administers the \\"shot\\", using an index finger to trace circles and dots on another child's forearm while reciting the rhyme, \\"Circle, circle, Dot, dot, ‚Äì Now you've got the cootie shot!\\" In some variations, a child then says, \\"Circle, circle, Square, square, ‚Äì Now you have it everywhere!\\" In this case, the child receives an immunization throughout their body. These variations may continue to a final shot where the child says, \\"Circle, circle, Knife, knife, ‚Äì Now you've got it all your life!\\". A number of other variations exist.

Xerxes I tomb relief. The location of ancient Ionia on the coast of modern-day Turkey. The Ionians (; , √ç≈çnes, singular , √ç≈çn) were one of the four major tribes that the Greeks considered themselves to be divided into during the ancient period; the other three being the Dorians, Aeolians, and Achaeans.Apollodorus I, 7.3 The Ionian dialect was one of the three major linguistic divisions of the Hellenic world, together with the Dorian and Aeolian dialects. When referring to populations, ‚ÄúIonian‚Äù defines several groups in Classical Greece. In its narrowest sense, the term referred to the region of Ionia in Asia Minor. In a broader sense, it could be used to describe all speakers of the Ionic dialect, which in addition to those in Ionia proper also included the Greek populations of Euboea, the Cyclades, and many cities founded by Ionian colonists. Finally, in the broadest sense it could be used to describe all those who spoke languages of the East Greek group, which included Attic. The foundation myth which was current in the Classical period suggested that the Ionians were named after Ion, son of Xuthus, who lived in the north Peloponnesian region of Aigialeia. When the Dorians invaded the Peloponnese they expelled the Achaeans from the Argolid and Lacedaemonia. The displaced Achaeans moved into Aigialeia (thereafter known as Achaea), in turn expelling the Ionians from Aigialeia.Pausanias VII, 1.7 The Ionians moved to Attica and mingled with the local population of Attica, and many later emigrated to the coast of Asia Minor founding the historical region of Ionia. Unlike the austere and militaristic Dorians, the Ionians are renowned for their love of philosophy, art, democracy, and pleasure ‚Äì Ionian traits that were most famously expressed by the Athenians.K≈çnstantinos D. Paparrƒìgopulos, Historikai Pragmateiai - Volume 1, 1858 Name Unlike \\"Aeolians\\" and \\"Dorians\\", \\"Ionians\\" appears in the languages of different civilizations around the eastern Mediterranean and as far east as the Indian subcontinent. They are not the earliest Greeks to appear in the records; that distinction belongs to the Danaans and the Achaeans. The trail of the Ionians begins in the Mycenaean Greek records of Crete. =Mycenaean= A fragmentary Linear B tablet from Knossos (tablet Xd 146) bears the name i-ja-wo-ne, interpreted by Ventris and Chadwick as possibly the dative or nominative plural case of *IƒÅwones, an ethnic name. The Knossos tablets are dated to 1400 or 1200 B.C. and thus pre-date the Dorian dominance in Crete, if the name refers to Cretans. The name first appears in Greek literature in Homer as ·º∏Œ¨ŒøŒΩŒµœÇ, iƒÅones,Homer. Iliad, Book XIII, Line 685. used on a single occasion of some long-robed Greeks attacked by Hector and apparently identified with Athenians, and this Homeric form appears to be identical with the Mycenaean form but without the *-w-. This name also appears in a fragment of the other early poet, Hesiod, in the singular ·º∏Œ¨œâŒΩ, iƒÅ≈çn.Hes. fr. 10a.23 M-W: see =Biblical= In the Book of GenesisBook of Genesis, 10.2. of the English Bible, Javan is a son of Japheth. Javan is believed nearly universally by Bible scholars to represent the Ionians; that is, Javan is Ion. The Hebrew is YƒÅwƒÅn, plural Y…ôwƒÅnƒ´m. Additionally, but less surely, Japheth may be related linguistically to the Greek mythological figure Iapetus. The locations of Biblical tribal countries have been the subjects of centuries of scholarship and yet remain to various degrees open questions. The Book of IsaiahBook of Isaiah 66.19. gives what may be a hint by listing \\"the nations... that have not heard my fame\\" including Javan and immediately after \\"the isles afar off.\\" These isles may be considered as an apposition to Javan or the last item in the series. If the former, the expression is typically used of the population of the islands in the Aegean Sea. The date of the Book of Isaiah cannot precede the date of the man Isaiah, in the 8th century BC. =Assyrian= Some letters of the Neo-Assyrian Empire in the 8th century BC record attacks by what appear to be Ionians on the cities of Phoenicia: > For example, a raid by the Ionians (ia-u-na-a-a) on the Phoenician coast is > reported to Tiglath-Pileser III in a letter from the 730s BC discovered at > Nimrud. The Assyrian word, which is preceded by the country determinative, has been reconstructed as *Iaunaia. More common is ia-a-ma-nu, ia-ma-nu and ia-am-na- a-a with the country determinative, reconstructed as IamƒÅnu. Sargon II related that he took the latter from the sea like fish and that they were from \\"the sea of the setting sun.\\" See pages 120-121. If the identification of Assyrian names is correct, at least some of the Ionian marauders came from Cyprus: See page 17 for the quote. > Sargon's Annals for 709, claiming that tribute was sent to him by 'seven > kings of Ya (ya-a'), a district of Yadnana whose distant abodes are situated > a seven-days' journey in the sea of the setting sun', is confirmed by a > stele set up at Citium in Cyprus 'at the base of a mountain ravine ... of > Yadnana.' =Indic= The Seleucid king Antiochos (\\"A·πÉtiyako Yona RƒÅjƒÅ\\" (\\"The Yona king Antiochos\\")) is named as a recipient of Ashoka's medical treatments, together with his Hellenistic neighbours, in the Edicts of Ashoka (circa 250 BCE). \\"A·πÉtiyako Yona RƒÅjƒÅ\\" (\\"The Greek king Antiochos\\"), mentioned in Major Rock Edict No.2, here at Girnar. Brahmi script. Ionians appear in Indic literature and documents as Yavana and Yona. In documents, these names refer to the Indo- Greek Kingdoms; that is, the states formed by the Macedonians, either Alexander the Great or his successors on the Indian subcontinent. The earliest such documentation is the Edicts of Ashoka, dated to 250 BC, within 10 or 20 years. =Iranian= Ionians appear in a number of Old Persian inscriptions of the Achaemenid Empire as YaunƒÅ (), a nominative plural masculine, singular Yauna; for example, an inscription of Darius on the south wall of the palace at Persepolis includes in the provinces of the empire \\"Ionians who are of the mainland and (those) who are by the sea, and countries which are across the sea; ....\\"Kent, p. 136. At that time the empire probably extended around the Aegean to northern Greece. =Other languages= Most modern Middle Eastern languages use the terms \\"Ionia\\" and \\"Ionian\\" to refer to Greece and Greeks. That is true of Hebrew (Yavan 'Greece' / Yevani fem. Yevania 'a Greek'), Armenian (Hunastan 'Greece' / Huyn 'a Greek'), and the Classical Arabic words (al-Y≈´nƒÅn 'Greece' / Y≈´nƒÅnƒ´ fem. Y≈´nƒÅniyya pl. Y≈´nƒÅn 'a Greek', probably from Aramaic YawnƒÅnƒÅ) are used in most modern Arabic dialects including Egyptian and Palestinian as well as being used in modern Persian (Y≈´nƒÅnestƒÅn 'Greece' / Y≈´nƒÅnƒ´ pl. Y≈´nƒÅnƒ´hƒÅ/Y≈´nƒÅnƒ´yƒÅn 'Greek') and Turkish too via Persian (Yunanistan 'Greece' / Yunanlƒ± 'a Greek person' pl. Yunanlƒ±lar 'Greek people'). =Etymology= The etymology of the word ·ººœâŒΩŒµœÇ or ·º∏Œ¨œùoŒΩŒµœÇ is uncertain.Robert S. P. Beekes, Etymological Dictionary of Greek, Brill, 2009, p. 608 f.

For a similar presentation in Beekes' A Greek Etymological Dictionary search on Ionian in Etymology. Both linguists state a full panoply of \\"Ionian\\" words with sources. There are, however, some theories: * From a Proto-Indo-European onomatopoeic root *wi- or *woi- expressing a shout uttered by persons running to the assistance of others; according to Pokorny, *Iawones could mean \\"devotees of Apollo\\", based on the cry i·∏ï pai·πìn uttered in his worship; the god was also called i·∏ïios himself.

Pre-Ionic Ionians The literary evidence of the Ionians leads back to mainland Greece in Mycenaean times before there was an Ionia. The classical sources seem determined that they were to be called Ionians along with other names even then. This cannot be documented with inscriptional evidence, and yet the literary evidence, which is manifestly at least partially legendary, seems to reflect a general verbal tradition. =Herodotus= Herodotus of Halicarnassus asserts:Herodotus. Histories. Book I, Chapter 147. > all are Ionians who are of Athenian descent and keep the feast Apaturia. He further explains:Herodotus. Histories. Book I, Chapter 143. > The whole Hellenic stock was then small, and the last of all its branches > and the least regarded was the Ionian; for it had no considerable city > except Athens. The Ionians spread from Athens to other places in the Aegean Sea: Sifnos and Serifos,Herodotus. Histories. Book 8, Section 48.1. Naxos,Herodotus. Histories. Book 8, Section 46.3. KeaHerodotus. Histories. Book 8, Section 46.2. and Samos.Herodotus. Histories. Book 6, Section 22.3. But they were not just from Athens:Herodotus. Histories. Book 7, Chapter 94. > These Ionians, as long as they were in the Peloponnesus, dwelt in what is > now called Achaea, and before Danaus and Xuthus came to the Peloponnesus, as > the Greeks say, they were called Aegialian Pelasgians. They were named > Ionians after Ion the son of Xuthus. Achaea was divided into 12 communities originally Ionian:Herodotus. Histories. Book 1, Section 145.1. Pellene, Aegira, Aegae, Bura, Helice, Aegion, Rhype, Patrae, Phareae, Olenus, Dyme and Tritaeae. The most aboriginal Ionians were of Cynuria:Herodotus. Histories. Book 8, Section 73.3. > The Cynurians are aboriginal and seem to be the only Ionians, but they have > been Dorianized by time and by Argive rule. =Strabo= In Strabo's account of the origin of the Ionians, Hellen, son of Deucalion, ancestor of the Hellenes, king of Phthia, arranged a marriage between his son Xuthus and the daughter of king Erechtheus of Athens. Xuthus then founded the Tetrapolis (\\"Four Cities\\") of Attica, a rural district. His son, Achaeus, went into exile in a land subsequently called Achaea after him. Another son of Xuthus, Ion, conquered Thrace, after which the Athenians made him king of Athens. Attica was called Ionia after his death. Those Ionians colonized Aigialia changing its name to Ionia also. When the Heracleidae returned the Achaeans drove the Ionians back to Athens. Under the Codridae they set forth for Anatolia and founded 12 cities in Caria and Lydia following the model of the 12 cities of Achaea, formerly Ionian.Strabo. Geography. Book 8, Section 7.1. Ionian School of philosophy During the 6th century BC, Ionian coastal towns, such as Miletus and Ephesus, became the focus of a revolution in traditional thinking about Nature. Instead of explaining natural phenomena by recourse to traditional religion/myth, the cultural climate was such that men began to form hypotheses about the natural world based on ideas gained from both personal experience and deep reflection. These men‚ÄîThales and his successors‚Äîwere called physiologoi, those who discoursed on Nature. They were skeptical of religious explanations for natural phenomena and instead sought purely mechanical and physical explanations. They are credited as being of critical importance to the development of the 'scientific attitude' towards the study of Nature. Notes Further reading * J. A. R Munro. \\"Pelasgians and Ionians\\".

Lemos, The Protogeometric Aegean: The Archaeology of the Late Eleventh and Tenth Centuries BC, Oxford University Press, 2002, p. 181. is the period of Greek history from the end of the Mycenaean palatial civilization around 1100 BC to the first signs of the Greek poleis (city-states) in the 9th century BC. The archaeological evidence shows a widespread collapse of Bronze Age civilization in the Eastern Mediterranean world at the outset of the period, as the great palaces and cities of the Mycenaeans were destroyed or abandoned. At about the same time, the Hittite civilization suffered serious disruption and cities from Troy to Gaza were destroyed and in Egypt the New Kingdom fell into disarray that led to the Third Intermediate Period. Following the collapse, fewer and smaller settlements suggest famine and depopulation. In Greece, the Linear B writing of the Greek language used by Mycenaean bureaucrats ceased and the Greek alphabet would not develop until the beginning of the Archaic Period. The decoration on Greek pottery after about 1100 BC lacks the figurative decoration of Mycenaean ware and is restricted to simpler, generally geometric styles (1000-700 BC). It was previously thought that all contact was lost between mainland Hellenes and foreign powers during this period, yielding little cultural progress or growth, but artifacts from excavations at Lefkandi on the Lelantine Plain in Euboea show that significant cultural and trade links with the east, particularly the Levant coast, developed from c. 900 BC onwards. Additionally, evidence has emerged of the new presence of Hellenes in sub-Mycenaean Cyprus and on the Syrian coast at Al-Mina. Fall of Mycenaeans The Mycenaean civilization started to collapse from 1200 BC. Archaeology suggests that, around 1100 BC, the palace centres and outlying settlements of the Mycenaeans' highly organized culture began to be abandoned or destroyed, and by 1050 BC, the recognizable features of Mycenaean culture had disappeared, and the population had decreased significantly. Many explanations attribute the fall of the Mycenaean civilization and the Bronze Age collapse to climatic or environmental catastrophe, combined with an invasion by Dorians or by the Sea Peoples, or to the widespread availability of edged weapons of iron, but no single explanation fits the available archaeological evidence.  Mediterranean warfare and Sea Peoples  A map of the Bronze Age collapse Around this time large-scale revolts took place in several parts of the eastern Mediterranean, and attempts to overthrow existing kingdoms were made as a result of economic and political instability by surrounding people, who were already plagued with famine and hardship. Part of the Hittite kingdom was invaded and conquered by the so-called Sea Peoples, whose origins, perhaps from different parts of the Mediterranean such as the Black Sea, the Aegean and Anatolian regions, remain obscured. The 13th- and 12th-century inscriptions and carvings at Karnak and Luxor are the only sources for \\"Sea Peoples\\", a term invented by the Egyptians themselves and recorded in boastful accounts of Egyptian military successes.Sandars (1978). For these so-called \\"Sea Peoples\\", there is little more evidence than these inscriptions. A similar assemblage of peoples may have attempted to invade Egypt twice, once during the reign of Merneptah, about 1208 BC, and again during the reign of Ramesses III, about 1178 BC.

With the collapse of the palatial centres, no more monumental stone buildings were built and the practice of wall painting may have ceased; writing in the Linear B script ceased, vital trade links were lost, and towns and villages were abandoned. Writing in the Linear B script ceased particularly because the redistributive economy had crashed, and there was no longer a need to keep records about commerce.The Early Greek Dark Age and Revival in the Near East. http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0009%3Achapter%3D3 Retrieved 2016-12-4 The population of Greece was reduced,Snodgrass 1971:360‚Äì68. and the world of organized state armies, kings, officials, and redistributive systems disappeared. Most of the information about the period comes from burial sites and the grave goods contained within them. The fragmented, localized, and autonomous cultures lacked cultural and aesthetic cohesion and are noted for their diversity of material cultures in pottery styles (e.g. conservative in Athens, eclectic in Knossos), burial practices, and settlement structures. The Protogeometric style of pottery was stylistically simpler than earlier designs, characterized by lines and curves. Generalizations about the \\"Dark Age Society\\" are considered simplifications, because the range of cultures throughout Greece at the time cannot be grouped into a single \\"Dark Age Society\\" category.\\"The most striking feature of the Dark Ages is its regionalism, its material diversity\\" (James Whitley, \\"Social Diversity in Dark Age Greece\\", The Annual of the British School at Athens 86 [1991:341‚Äì365]) pp. 342, 344ff. Tholos tombs are found in early Iron Age Thessaly and in Crete but not in general elsewhere, and cremation was the dominant rite in Attica but nearby in the Argolid, it was inhumation.Snodgrass 1971:140‚Äì212. Some former sites of Mycenaean palaces, such as Argos or Knossos, continued to be occupied; the fact that other sites experienced an expansive \\"boom time\\" of a generation or two before they were abandoned has been associated by James Whitley with the \\"big-man social organization\\", which is based on personal charisma and is inherently unstable: he interprets Lefkandi in this light.Whitley 1991. Some regions in Greece, such as Attica, Euboea and central Crete, recovered economically from these events faster than others, but life for the poorest Greeks would have remained relatively unchanged as it had done for centuries. There was still farming, weaving, metalworking and pottery but at a lower level of output and for local use in local styles. Some technical innovations were introduced around 1050 BC with the start of the Protogeometric style (1050-900 BC), such as the superior pottery technology that included a faster potter's wheel for superior vase shapes and the use of a compass to draw perfect circles and semicircles for decoration. Better glazes were achieved by higher temperature firing of clay. However, the overall trend was toward simpler, less intricate pieces and fewer resources being devoted to the creation of beautiful art. The smelting of iron was learned from Cyprus and the Levant and was exploited and improved upon by using local deposits of iron ore previously ignored by the Mycenaeans: edged weapons were now within reach of less elite warriors. Though the universal use of iron was one shared feature among Dark Age settlements,Whitley 1991:343, notes regional differences in iron-working in A.N. Snodgrass, The Dark Age of Greece (1971:213‚Äì95), and I.M. Morris, \\"Circulation, deposition and the formation of the Greek Iron Age,\\" Man, n.s. 23(1989:502‚Äì19) it is still uncertain when the forged iron weapons and armour achieved superior strength to those that had been previously cast and hammered from bronze. From 1050, many small local iron industries appeared, and by 900, almost all weapons in grave goods were made of iron. The distribution of the Ionic Greek dialect in historic times indicates early movement from the mainland of Greece to the Anatolian coast to such sites as Miletus, Ephesus, and Colophon, perhaps as early as 1000, but the contemporaneous evidence is scant. In Cyprus, some archaeological sites begin to show identifiably Greek ceramics,V. Karageorghis, Early Cyprus, 2002. a colony of Euboean Greeks was established at Al Mina on the Syrian coast, and a reviving Aegean Greek network of exchange can be detected from 10th-century Attic Protogeometric pottery found in Crete and at Samos, off the coast of Asia Minor.R.W.V. Catling, \\"Exports of Attic protogeometric pottery and their identification by non-analytical means\\", Annual of the British School at Athens 93 (1998:365‚Äì78), noted in Robin Lane Fox, Travelling Heroes in the Epic Age of Homer, 2008:48; Fox provides the cultural background to his study of Euboean cultural contacts in the Mediterranean in the 8th century.

Together with distinctively Greek Euboean ceramic wares, it was widely exported and is found in Levantine sites, including Tyre and far inland in the late 11th and 10th centuries. Cypriot metalwork was exchanged in Crete. Society It is likely that Greece during this period was divided into independent regions organized by kinship groups and the oikoi or households, the origins of the later poleis. Excavations of Dark Age communities such as Nichoria in the Peloponnese have shown how a Bronze Age town was abandoned in 1150 BC but then reemerged as a small village cluster by 1075 BC. At this time there were only around forty families living there with plenty of good farming land and grazing for cattle. The remains of a 10th century building, including a megaron, on the top of the ridge have led to speculation that this was the chieftain's house. This was a larger structure than those surrounding it but it was still made from the same materials (mud brick and thatched roof). It was perhaps also a place of religious significance and of communal storage of food. High status individuals did in fact exist in the Dark Age, but their standard of living was not significantly higher than others of their village.Snodgrass (1971). Most Greeks did not live in isolated farmsteads but in small settlements. It is likely that, as at the dawn of the historical period two or three hundred years later, the main economic resource for each family was the ancestral plot of land of the oikos, the kleros or allotment; without this a man could not marry.Hurwitt (1985). Lefkandi burial The Protogeometric building and the cemetery at Toumba Lefkandi Lefkandi on the island of Euboea was a prosperous settlement in the Late Bronze Age, possibly to be identified with old Eretria.The candidates and their opponents are noted in Fox 2008:51 note 23. It recovered quickly from the collapse of Mycenaean culture, and in 1981 excavators of a burial ground found the largest 10th-century building yet known from Greece.M. R. Popham, P. G. Calligas, and L. H. Sackett, (eds.), Lefkandi II: the Protogeometric Building at Toumba, Part 2\\\\. The Excavation, Architecture and Finds, BSA Suppl. vol. 23, Oxford 1993. Sometimes called \\"the heroon\\", this long narrow building, 50 metres by 10 metres, or about 150 feet by 30 feet, contained two burial shafts. In one were placed four horses and the other contained a cremated male buried with his iron weapons and an inhumed woman, heavily adorned with gold jewellery.Edward Bispham, Thomas Harrisom, Brian A. Sparkes, Ancient Greece and Rome, page 89, The Edinburgh Companion, Ed 2006. The man's bones were placed in a bronze jar from Cyprus, with hunting scenes on the cast rim. The woman was clad with gold coils in her hair, rings, gold breast plates, an heirloom necklace (an elaborate Cypriot or Near Eastern necklace made some 200 to 300 years before her burial) and an ivory-handled dagger at her head. The horses appeared to have been sacrificed, some appearing to have iron bits in their mouths. No evidence survives to show whether the building was erected to house the burial, or whether the \\"hero\\" or local chieftain in the grave was cremated and then buried in his grand house; whichever is true, the house was soon demolished and the debris used to form a roughly circular mound over the wall stumps. Between this period and approximately 820 BC, rich members of the community were cremated and buried close to the eastern end of the building, in much the same way Christians might seek to be buried close to a saint's grave; the presence of imported objects, notable throughout more than eighty further burials, contrast with other nearby cemeteries at Lefkandi and attest to a lasting elite tradition. End Ancient Greek pair of terracotta boots. Early geometric period cremation burial of a woman, 900 BC. Ancient Agora Museum in Athens. The archaeological record of many sites demonstrates that the economic recovery of Greece was well underway by the beginning of the 8th century BC. Cemeteries, such as the Kerameikos in Athens or Lefkandi, and sanctuaries, such as Olympia, recently founded in Delphi or the Heraion of Samos, first of the colossal free-standing temples, were richly provided with offerings - including items from the Near East, Egypt, and Italy made of exotic materials including amber and ivory. Exports of Greek pottery demonstrate contact with the Levant coast at sites such as Al-Mina and with the region of the Villanovan culture to the north of Rome. The decoration of pottery became more elaborate and included figured scenes that parallel the stories of Homeric Epic. Iron tools and weapons improved; renewed Mediterranean trade brought new supplies of copper and tin to make a wide range of elaborate bronze objects, such as tripod stands like those offered as prizes in the funeral games celebrated by Achilles for Patroclus.Homer, Iliad XXIII Other coastal regions of Greece besides Euboea were once again full participants in the commercial and cultural exchanges of the eastern and central Mediterranen and communities developed governance by an elite group of aristocrats rather than by the single basileus or chieftain of earlier periods.J.N. Coldstream, Geometric Greece: 900-700 BC, 1979. New writing system By the mid- to late-8th century BC, a new Greek alphabet system was adopted from the Phoenician alphabet by a Greek with first-hand experience of it. The Greeks adapted the abjad used to write Phoenician (a Semitic language used by the Phoenicians), notably introducing characters for vowel sounds and thereby creating the first truly alphabetic writing system. The new alphabet quickly spread throughout the Mediterranean and was used to write not only the Greek language, but also Phrygian and other languages in the eastern Mediterranean. As Greece sent out colonies west towards Sicily and Italy (Pithekoussae, Cumae), the influence of their new alphabet extended further. The ceramic Euboean artifact inscribed with a few lines written in the Greek alphabet referring to \\"Nestor's Cup\\", discovered in a grave at Pithekoussae (Ischia), dates from c. 730 BC; it seems to be the oldest written reference to the Iliad. The Etruscans benefited from the innovation: Old Italic variants spread throughout Italy from the 8th century. Other variants of the alphabet appear on the Lemnos Stele and in the alphabets of Asia Minor. The previous Linear scripts were not completely abandoned: the Cypriot syllabary, descended from Linear A, remained in use on Cyprus in Arcadocypriot Greek and Eteocypriot inscriptions until the Hellenistic era. Continuity thesis Some scholars have argued against the concept of a Greek Dark Age, on grounds that the former lack of archaeological evidence in a period that was mute in its lack of inscriptions (thus \\"dark\\") has been shown to be an accident of discovery rather than a fact of history.O.T.P.K.

They extend for approximately as a greatly elevated plateau about wide on the south, narrowing to a point at the north, with elevations generally increasing south to north. The range's broad southern end is near the community of Big Pine, where Westgard Pass and Deep Springs Valley separate it from the Inyo Mountains. The narrow northern end is at Montgomery Pass, where U.S. Route 6 crosses. The Fish Lake Valley lies east of the range; the southeast part of the mountains are separated from the Silver Peak Range by block faulting across the Furnace Creek Fault Zone, forming a feeder valley to Fish Lake Valley. The range lies within the eastern section of the Inyo National Forest. Ecology Ecologically, the White Mountains are like the other ranges in the Basin and Range Province; they are dry, but the upper slopes from hold open subalpine forests of Great Basin bristlecone pine on permeable dolomite and certain granite substrates and limber pine on less permeable rocky substrates. Middle slopes from have somewhat denser stands of pi√±on pine and Utah juniper. These upper and lower conifer zones are often separated by a zone of mountain mahogany brush. Various subspecies of sagebrush (Artemisia tridentata) extend from surrounding valleys to the lower alpine zone. Bristlecone pine, White Mountains, California. A bristlecone pine, named Methuselah, located within the mountain range is the oldest known, verified living tree in the world, at years old. Pine nuts from pi√±on pine stands were harvested as a winter staple food by Paiute Indians whose descendants still live in adjacent valleys. The White Mountains also have small remnant groves of lodgepole pine, Jeffrey pine, ponderosa pine, Sierra juniper and aspen including an unusual dwarf variety. These species are common in the nearby and wetter Sierra Nevada range west of the Owens Valley and must have been more widespread in the White Mountains until Holocene droughts extirpated them in most of this drier range. A number of plant species are endemic to the White Mountains, including the White Mountains horkelia, Horkelia hispidula. Fauna include two herds of bighorn sheep, mule deer, marmots and feral horses. Permanent streams have no native fish, but there are naturalized populations of trout including rare Paiute cutthroat trout which is protected from angling. Birds include Clark's nutcracker and other Corvidae which eat and cache pine nuts. History Cattle from ranches in surrounding valleys are still grazed under permit as high as the alpine zone. Historically sheep were also grazed in large numbers, introducing diseases from which the native Bighorn Sheep populations are still slowly recovering. Before European colonization of surrounding valleys in the mid 19th century, Paiute Indians occupied summer hunting camps up to about , leaving ruins of archeological interest. Geography Aerial view of the White Mountains, looking north over the Pellisier Flats to Montgomery and Boundary Peaks at the end of the range. The highest point in the range is White Mountain Peak, which at is the third-highest summit in California. This peak is actually an extinct volcano rising about above the plateau surface. The summit is composed of Mesozoic metavolcanic rock ‚Äì lava lifted and melted by rising granite. The volcano itself is long since gone. The White Mountains are the highest range completely inside the Great Basin, although the adjacent Sierra Nevada Range along the basin's western edge has two higher summits. The entire range is within the Inyo National Forest. Hiking A four-wheel drive road reaches the summit of White Mountain Peak from the south to service the summit laboratory of the White Mountain Research Center. The road is normally gated seven miles from the summit at an elevation of , making this California's easiest summit. Boundary and Montgomery Peaks at the north end of the range North of White Mountain Peak, two sharp ar√™tes alternate along the crest with the broad \\"whalebacks\\" plateau of Pellisier Flats with about six more summits over . Pellisier Flats is a wide sloping bench at the 13000 foot level with rocky fields and short alpine vegetation. The bench includes Mt. Hogue at 12,743 ft. and further north Mt. Dubois at 13,559 ft., the high point on the plateau. Pellisier Flats is the broad spine of the White Mountains. The crest crosses the California‚ÄìNevada state line just south of a final high summit Boundary Peak , Nevada's high point. Boundary Peak is the \\"prow\\" of the triangular fault block. It has views directly down into valleys to the west, north and east that are hidden by the increasing width of the high plateau to the south. North of Boundary Peak the range rapidly loses altitude and ends at Montgomery Pass. The west face of the White Mountains rises steeply out of Owens Valley. Climbing to any summit from this direction is a scramble with about elevation gain. Eastern slopes are somewhat gentler and have numerous cirques left by Pleistocene glaciers and even a few snowfields persisting through most summers. Most of these cirques are entered or approached by jeep roads and offer scenic yet non-technical routes to the crest.

The visual arts have a long history in Australia, with evidence of Aboriginal art dating back at least 30,000 years. Australia has produced many notable artists of both Western and Indigenous Australian schools, including the late-19th-century Heidelberg School plein air painters, the Antipodeans, the Central Australian Hermannsburg School watercolourists, the Western Desert Art Movement and coeval examples of well-known High modernism and Postmodern art. History =Indigenous Australia= Bradshaw rock art in the Kimberley region of Western Australia The first ancestors of Aboriginal Australians are believed to have arrived in Australia as early as 60,000 years ago, and evidence of Aboriginal art in Australia can be traced back at least 30,000 years. Examples of ancient Aboriginal rock artworks can be found throughout the continent. Notable examples can be found in national parks, such as those of the UNESCO listed sites at Uluru and Kakadu National Park in the Northern Territory, and the Bradshaw rock paintings in the Kimberley region of Western Australia.

He remains notable for his artworks which recorded traditional Aboriginal ways for the education of Westerners (which remain on permanent exhibition at the Ian Potter Centre of the National Gallery of Victoria and at the Ballarat Fine Art Gallery). Margaret Preston (1875‚Äì1963) was among the early non-indigenous painters to incorporate Aboriginal influences in her works. Albert Namatjira (1902‚Äì1959) is a famous Australian artist and an Arrernte man. His landscapes inspired the Hermannsburg School of art. The works of Elizabeth Durack are notable for their fusion of Western and indigenous influences. Since the 1970s, indigenous artists have employed the use of acrylic paints ‚Äì with styles such as the Western Desert Art Movement becoming globally renowned 20th-century art movements. The National Gallery of Australia exhibits a great many indigenous art works, including those of the Torres Strait Islands who are known for their traditional sculpture and headgear. The Art Gallery of New South Wales has an extensive collection of indigenous Australian art. In May 2011, the Director of the Place, Evolution, and Rock Art Heritage Unit (PERAHU) at Griffith University, Paul Ta√ßon, called for the creation of a national database for rock art. Paul Ta√ßon launched the \\"Protect Australia‚Äôs Spirit\\" campaign in May 2011 with the highly regarded Australian actor Jack Thompson.

Rock Art Research is published twice a year and also covers international scholarship of rock art. =Early European depictions= George Stubbs, The Kongouro from New Holland, 1772 The first artistic representations of the Australia scene by European artists were mainly natural history illustrations, depicting the distinctive flora and fauna of the land for scientific purposes, and the topography of the coast. Sydney Parkinson, the Botanical illustrator on James Cook's 1770 voyage that first charted the eastern coastline of Australia, made a large number of such drawings under the direction of naturalist Joseph Banks. Many of these drawings were met with skepticism when taken back to Europe, for example claims that the platypus was a hoax. In the form of copies and reproductions, George Stubbs' 1772 paintings Portrait of a Large Dog and The Kongouro from New Holland‚Äîdepicting a dingo and kangaroo respectively‚Äîwere the first images of Australian fauna to be widely disseminated in Britain. =British colonisation (1788‚Äì1850)= Early Western art in Australia, from British colonisation in 1788 onwards, is often narrated as the gradual shift from a European sense of light to an Australian one. The lighting in Australia is notably different from that of Europe, and early attempts at landscapes attempted to reflect this. It has also been one of transformation, where artistic ideas originating from beyond (primarily Europe) gained new meaning and purpose when transplanted into the new continent and the emerging society.Art in Australia: From Colonization to Postmodernism. Christopher Allen (1997). Thames and Hudson, World of Art series. Despite Banks' suggestions, no professional natural-history artist sailed on the First Fleet in 1788. Until the turn of the century all drawings made in the colony were crafted by soldiers, including British naval officers George Raper and John Hunter, and convict artists, including Thomas Watling.James Gleeson, Australian Painting. Edited by John Henshaw. 1971. However, many of these drawings are by unknown artists, most notably the Port Jackson Painter. Most are in the style of naval draughtsmanship, and cover natural history topics, specifically birds, and a few depict the infant colony itself. John Glover, A View of the Artist's House and Garden, 1835 Several professional natural-history illustrators accompanied expeditions in the early 19th century, including Ferdinand Bauer, who travelled with Matthew Flinders, and Charles-Alexandre Lesueur, who travelled with a French expedition led by Nicolas Baudin. The first resident professional artist was John Lewin, who arrived in 1800 and published two volumes of natural history art. Ornithologist John Gould was renowned for his illustrations of the country's birds. In the late 19th century Harriet and Helena Scott were highly respected natural history illustrators Lewin's Platypus (1808) represents the fine detail and scientific observation displayed by many of these early painters. As well as inspiration in natural history, there were some ethnographic portraiture of Aboriginal Australians, particularly in the 1830s. Artists included Augustus Earle in New South Wales and Benjamin Duterrau, Robert Dowling and the sculptor Benjamin Law, recording images of Tasmanian Aborigines. The most significant landscape artist of this era was John Glover. Heavily influenced by 18th-century European landscape painters, such as Claude Lorraine and Salvator Rosa, his works captured the distinctive Australian features of open country, fallen logs, and blue hills.Australian Painting: 1788‚Äì2000. Bernard Smith with Terry Smith and Christopher Heathcote (2001). Oxford University Press. Conrad Martens (1801‚Äì1878) worked from 1835 to 1878 as a professional artist, painting many landscapes and was commercially successful. His work has been regarded as softening the landscape to fit European sensibilities. His watercolour studies of Sydney Harbour are well regarded, and seen as introducing Romantic ideals to his paintings. Martens is also remembered for accompanying scientist Charles Darwin on HMS Beagle (as had Augustus Earle).

S. T. Gill (1818‚Äì1880) documented life on the Australian gold fields, however the colonial art market primarily desired landscape paintings, which were commissioned by wealthy landowners or merchants wanting to record their material success. William Piguenit's (1836‚Äì1914) \\"Flood in the Darling\\" was acquired by the National Gallery of New South Wales in 1895.McCulloch, Alan McCulloch, Susan McCulloch & Emily McCulloch Childs: McCulloch‚Äôs Encyclopedia of Australian Art Melbourne University Press, 2006 Some of the artists of note included Eugene von Guerard, Nicholas Chevalier, William Strutt, John Skinner Prout and Knut Bull. Louis Buvelot was a key figure in landscape painting in the later period. He was influenced by the Barbizon school painters, and so using a plein air technique, and a more domesticated and settled view of the land, in contrast to the emphasis on strangeness or danger prevalent in earlier painters. This approach, together with his extensive teaching influence, have led his to dubbed the \\"Father of Landscape Painting in Australia\\". A few attempts at art exhibitions were made in the 1840s, which attracted a number of artists but were commercial failures. By the 1850s, however, regular exhibitions became popular, with a variety of art types represented. The first of these exhibitions was in 1854 in Melbourne. An art museum, which eventually became the National Gallery of Victoria, was founded in 1861, and it began to collect Australian works as well as gathering a collection of European masters. Crucially, it also opened an Art School, important for the following generations of Australian-born and raised artists. H. J. Johnstone, a professional photographer and student of Buvelot, painted the large-scale bush scene Evening Shadows (1880), the first acquisition of the Art Gallery of South Australia and possibly Australia's most reproduced painting.'Evening shadows, backwater of the Murray, South Australia', Art Gallery of South Australia.

Named after a camp Tom Roberts and Arthur Streeton established in Heidelberg (then a rural suburb on the outskirts of Melbourne), these painters, together with Frederick McCubbin, Charles Conder and others, began an impressionistic plein air approach to the Australian landscape that remains embedded in Australia's popular consciousness, both in and outside the art world. Many of their most famous works depict scenes of pastoral and outback Australia. Central themes of their art include manual labour, conquering the land, and an idealisation of the rural pioneer. By the 1890s most Australians were city-dwellers, as were the artists themselves, and a romantic view of pioneer life gave great power and popularity to images such as Shearing the Rams. In this work Roberts uses formal composition and strong realism to dignify the shearers whilst the relative anonymity of the men and their subdued expressions, elevate their work as the real subject, rather that the specific individuals portrayed. In their portrayal of the nobility of rural life, the Heidelberg artists reveal their debt to Millet, Bastien-Lepage and Courbet, but the techniques and aims of the French Impressionists provide more direct inspiration and influenced their actual practise. In their early and extremely influential Exhibition of 9 by 5 Impressions of small sketches, their impressionistic programme was clear, as evidenced from their catalogue: \\"An effect is only momentary: so an impressionist tries to find his place... it has been the object of artists to render faithfully, and thus obtain first records of effects widely differing, and often of very fleeting character.\\" Other significant painters associated with the Heidelberg painters were Walter Withers, who won the inaugural Wynne Prize in 1896,Alan McCulloch, Golden Age of Australian Painting: Impressionism and the Heidelberg School and Jane Sutherland, a student of McCubbin. Born and raised in Sydney, impressionist John Russell spent much of his career in Europe, where he befriended the likes of Vincent van Gogh and Claude Monet. He also wrote letters home to his friend, Tom Roberts, updating him on developments in French impressionism.

Artists such as Hans Heysen and Elioth Gruner built on the Australian landscape tradition of the Heidelberg painters, creating grand, nationalist pastoral landscapes. Others moved on to successful careers in London and Paris, such as Rupert Bunny and Hugh Ramsay.

The National Gallery of Australia, the Gallery of Modern Art and the Art Gallery of New South Wales have major strengths in collecting the art of the Asia Pacific Region. Others include the National Gallery of Victoria in Melbourne, which has a significant Australian collection of Western art. Museum of Contemporary Art, Sydney and the privately owned Museum of Old and New Art in Hobart, Tasmania and White Rabbit Gallery in Sydney are widely regarded as autonomously discerning collections of international contemporary art. Other institutions include the Art Gallery of South Australia in Adelaide, Newcastle Art Gallery, the National Portrait Gallery of Australia, the National Museum of Australia, the Canberra Museum and Gallery, the Tasmanian Museum and Art Gallery in Hobart, the Museum and Art Gallery of the Northern Territory in Darwin, and the Art Gallery of Western Australia in Perth. The State Library of New South Wales holds a significant collection comprising over a quarter of a million artworks many from the Colonial period. More material is held by other National and State libraries.  Art market  The boom and bust cycle in contemporary art is evident in the 1980s colonial art boom ending at the time of the 1987 stock market crash and the exit of many artists and dealers, followed by the 2000s boom in Aboriginal dot painting and Australian late modernist painting, which ended at the time of the global financial crisis and growing collector and public interest in the international contemporary art circuit. A 5% resale royalty scheme commenced in 2010 under which artists receive 5% of the sale price when eligible artworks are resold commercially for $1000 or more. Between 10 June 2010 and 15 May 2013, the scheme generated over $1.5 million in royalties for 610 artists. Some buyers object to paying any resale royalty while others do not mind a royalty going directly to the artists. However, they worry about further red tape and bureaucratic interference. In 2014/15 there was a rediscovery of colonial art at auction. Affordable 20th-century rural scene painting is buoyant. While the inflated northern hemisphere art markets had anticipating a massive correction in the Australian art market which transitioned to the middle market. Socially oriented art events such as art fairs and biennials have continued to grow in size and popularity in the contemporary art scene. The smaller commercial galleries have struggled to remain in business in the 2010s in spite of a functioning economy, although there is little consensus on the reasons for this. A new market has arisen in China, where Australian artists are selling works in a traditionally local market: \\"While the Chinese have always had a passion for traditional Chinese art, according to global auction house Sotheby's, the surging interest in contemporary international art is a recent trend.\\" The market for Aboriginal art is still very strong, on the national and international stage, since becoming a solid financial investment in the 1980s. Not only do all the regional and State Galleries acquire significant collections of Aboriginal art, but private galleries are showing featured artists abroad. Aboriginal artists are also represented in all the major landscape prizes Australia. In 2019, \\"the Wynne prize, worth $50,000, was won by Sylvia Ken for her painting Seven Sisters ‚Äì marking the fourth year in a row that the landscape prize has been won by Indigenous artists.\\" Australian visual arts in other countries The museum for Australian Aboriginal art 'La grange' in Neuch√¢tel, Switzerland, was one of the few museums in Europe that dedicated itself entirely to Aboriginal art.

It has latterly been described as Australian impressionism. Melbourne art critic Sidney Dickinson coined the term in an 1891 review of works by Arthur Streeton and Walter Withers, two local artists who painted en plein air in Heidelberg on the city's rural outskirts. The term has since evolved to cover painters who worked together at \\"artists' camps\\" around Melbourne and Sydney in the 1880s and 1890s. Along with Streeton and Withers, Tom Roberts, Charles Conder and Frederick McCubbin are considered key figures of the movement. Drawing on naturalist and impressionist ideas, they sought to capture Australian life, the bush, and the harsh sunlight that typifies the country. The movement emerged at a time of strong nationalist sentiment in Australia, then a group of colonies on the cusp of federating. The artists' paintings, not unlike the bush poems of the Bulletin School, were celebrated for being distinctly Australian in character, and by the early 20th century, critics had come to identify the movement as the beginning of an Australian tradition in Western art. Many of their most recognisable works can be seen in Australia's major public galleries, including the National Gallery of Australia, the National Gallery of Victoria and the Art Gallery of New South Wales. History The name refers to the then rural area of Heidelberg east of Melbourne where practitioners of the style found their subject matter, though usage expanded to cover other Australian artists working in similar areas. The core group painted together at \\"artists' camps\\", the first being the Box Hill artists' camp, established in 1885. Besides Arthur Streeton and Walter Withers, other major artists in the movement included Tom Roberts, Frederick McCubbin and Charles Conder.Heidelberg Artists Trail See below for a list of other associated artists. =9 by 5 Impression Exhibition= In August 1889, several artists of the Heidelberg School staged the 9 by 5 Impression Exhibition at Buxton's Rooms, Swanston Street, opposite the Melbourne Town Hall. The exhibition's three principal artists were Charles Conder, Tom Roberts and Arthur Streeton, with minor contributions from Frederick McCubbin, National Gallery students R. E. Falls and Herbert Daly, and sculptor Charles Douglas Richardson, who exhibited five sculpted impressions. Most of the 183 works included in the exhibition were painted on wooden cigar-box lids, measuring 9 by 5 inches (23 √ó 13 cm), hence the name of the exhibition. Louis Abrahams, a member of the Box Hill artists' camp, sourced most of the lids from his family's tobacconist shop. In order to emphasise the small size of the paintings, the artists displayed them in broad Red Gum frames, some left unornamented, others decorated with verse and small sketches, giving the works an \\"unconventional, avant garde look\\".Lane, Australian Impressionism, p. 159 The Japonist d√©cor of Buxton's Rooms featured Japanese screens, umbrellas, and vases with flowers that perfumed the gallery, while the influence of Whistler's Aestheticism also shone through in the harmony and \\"total effect\\" of the display.Clark 1986, p. 114. The artists wrote in the catalogue: The exhibition caused a stir with many members of Melbourne's intelligentsia attending during its three-week run. The general public, though somewhat bemused, responded positively, and within two weeks of the opening, most of the 9 by 5s had sold. The response from critics, however, was mixed. The most scathing review came from James Smith, then Australia's foremost art critic, who said the 9 by 5s were \\"destitute of all sense of the beautiful\\" and \\"whatever influence [the exhibition] was likely to exercise could scarcely be otherwise than misleading and pernicious.\\"Smith, James. \\"An Impressionist Exhibition\\". The Argus. 17 August 1889. The artists pasted the review to the entrance of the venue‚Äîattracting many more passing pedestrians to, in Streeton's words, \\"see the dreadful paintings\\"‚Äîand responded with a letter to the Editor of Smith's newspaper, The Argus. Described as a manifesto, the letter defends freedom of choice in subject and technique, concluding: The 9 by 5 Impression Exhibition is now regarded as a landmark event in Australian art history.Moore, William (1934). The Story of Australian Art. Sydney: Angus & Robertson. . p. 74 Approximately one-third of the 9 by 5s are known to have survived, many of which are held in Australia's public collections, and have sold at auction for prices exceeding $1,000,000.

The architects arranged the lighting and interior design of the building after consulting Roberts, who, along with Heidelberg School members Jane Sutherland and Clara Southern, was among the first artists to occupy a studio in the building. They were soon followed by Charles Conder, Louis Abrahams and John Mather.Significant sites, National Gallery of Victoria. Retrieved 29 February 2016. Many of the artists decorated their studios in an Aesthetic manner, showing the influence of James Abbott McNeill Whistler. Roberts' use of eucalypts and golden wattle as floral decorations started a fad for gum leaves in the home. He also initiated in- studio conversaziones at which artists discussed recent trends and read the latest art journals. The presence of Roberts, Streeton and Conder at Grosvenor Chambers accounts for the high number of urban views they included in the 9 by 5 Impression Exhibition. =Sydney= Arthur Streeton, Sunlight Sweet, Coogee, 1890 Roberts first visited Sydney in 1887. There, he developed a strong artistic friendship with Charles Conder, a young painter who had already gone on plein air excursions outside Sydney and picked up some impressionist techniques from expatriate artist G. P. Nerli. In early 1888, before Conder joined Roberts on his return trip to Melbourne, the pair painted companion works at the beachside suburb of Coogee. Photograph of Streeton painting en plein air at Curlew Camp, c. 1892 When a severe economic depression hit Melbourne in 1890, Roberts and Streeton moved to Sydney, first setting up camp at Mosman Bay, a small cove of the harbour, before finally settling around the corner at Curlew Camp, which was accessible by the Mosman ferry. Other plen air painters occasionally joined them at Curlew, including Albert Henry Fullwood and prominent art teacher and Heidelberg School supporter Julian Ashton, who resided nearby at the Balmoral artists' camp. Ashton had earlier introduced Conder to plein air painting, and in 1890, as a trustee of the National Gallery of New South Wales in Sydney, secured the acquisition of Streeton's Heidelberg landscape Still glides the stream, and shall for ever glide (1890)‚Äîthe first of the artist's works to enter a public collection.Galbally, Ann (1972). Arthur Streeton. Oxford University Press, p. 13. The more sympathetic patronage shown by Ashton and others in Sydney inspired more artists to make the move from Melbourne. Streeton won acclaim in Sydney for his harbour views, many of which were collected by Eadith Walker and Howard Hinton, two of the city's leading art patrons. In a poem dedicated to the artist, composer and outspoken sensualist George Marshall-Hall declared Streeton's Sydney the \\"City of laughing loveliness! Sun-girdled Queen!\\", which became the title of one of his harbour views. The National Gallery of Victoria notes:Australian Impressionism: Sites, National Gallery of Victoria. Retrieved 16 March 2016. From Sydney, Streeton and Roberts branched out into country New South Wales, where, in the early 1890s, they painted some of their most celebrated works. Influences and style The landscapes of early Melbourne artist Louis Buvelot were particularly influential on the Heidelberg School. Like many of their contemporaries in Europe and North America, members of the Heidelberg School adopted a direct and impressionistic style of painting. They regularly painted landscapes en plein air, and sought to depict daily life. They showed a keen interest in the effects of lighting, and experimented with a variety of brushstroke techniques. A number of art critics, including Robert Hughes, have noted that the \\"impressionism\\" of the Heidelberg School had more in common with Whistler's tonal impressionism than the broken colours of the French impressionists. Indeed, the Heidelberg School artists did not espouse any colour theory, and, unlike the more radical approach of the French artists, often maintained some degree of academic emphasis on form, clarity and composition.Hughes, Robert (1966). The Art of Australia. Penguin Books Australia Ltd, Melbourne. . pp. 55-56. They also sometimes created works within the narrative conventions of Victorian painting. The Australians had little direct contact with the French impressionists; for example, it was not until 1907 that McCubbin saw their works in person, which is reflected in his evolution towards a looser, more abstracted style. The Heidelberg School painters were not merely following an international trend, but \\"were interested in making paintings that looked distinctly Australian\\".Australian Impressionism: Education Resource, National Gallery of Victoria. Retrieved 16 March 2016. They greatly admired the light-infused landscapes of Louis Buvelot, a Swiss-born artist and art teacher who, in the 1860s, adapted French Barbizon School principles to the countryside around Melbourne. Regarding Buvelot as \\"the father of Australian landscape painting\\", they showed little interest in the works of earlier colonial artists, opining that they looked more like European scenes that did not reflect Australia's harsh sunlight, earthier colours and distinctive vegetation. The Heidelberg School painters spoke of seeing Australia \\"through Australian eyes\\", and by 1889, Roberts argued that they had successfully developed \\"a distinct and vital and creditable style\\".\\"An Australian Artist: A Little Talk With Tom Roberts\\", Melbourne Punch. Retrieved 4 May 2020. The notion that they were the first to objectively capture Australia's \\"scrubby bush\\" gained widespread acceptance in the early 20th century, but has since been disputed; for example, art historian Bernard Smith identified \\"an authentic bush atmosphere\\" in John Lewin's landscapes of the 1810s,Smith, Bernard (1962). Australian Painting: 1788-1960. Oxford University Press, p. 19. and John Glover in the 1830s is seen to have faithfully rendered Australia's unique light and sprawling, untidy gum trees.McPhee, John (2003). The Art of John Glover. Associated artists Many Heidelberg School artists were active members of the Victorian Artists' Society. There was no official membership of the Heidelberg School, but artists are said to be part of the movement based on their adoption of plein airism and impressionist techniques, as well as their attendance at the Melbourne and Sydney \\"artists' camps\\". Heidelberg School artists also often trained together at the National Gallery of Victoria Art School, and staged group exhibitions at the Victorian Artists' Society.

Initially, subscribers using personal computers accessed the Prodigy service by means of copper wire telephone \\"POTS\\" service or X.25 dialup. For its initial roll-out, Prodigy used 1,200 bit/s modem connections. To provide faster service and to stabilize the diverse modem market, Prodigy offered low-cost 2,400 bit/s internal modems to subscribers at a discount. The host systems used were regionally distributed IBM Series/1 minicomputers managed by central IBM mainframes located in Yorktown Heights, New York. The company claimed it was the first consumer online service, citing its graphical user interface and basic architecture as differentiation from CompuServe, which started in 1979 and used a command-line interface.Tech Republic: \\"The Pre-Internet Online Service That Didn't Live Up To Its Name By 1990 it was the second-largest (and 1993 the largest) online service provider, with 465,000 subscribers trailing only CompuServe's 600,000.Shapiro, Eben. \\"THE MEDIA BUSINESS; New Features Are Planned By Prodigy\\", The New York Times, September 6, 1990 (The French Minitel had one million, but was used mainly from passive low-cost ASCII/Teletex terminals).

It has 465,000 subscribers, compared with more than 600,000 for Compuserve Information Services, a unit of H & R Block Inc.\\" Its headquarters were in White Plains, New YorkFunding Universe: History of Prodigy through 1990 until 2000, when it moved to Austin, Texas. Early history The roots of Prodigy date to 1980 when broadcaster CBS and telecommunications firm AT&T; Corporation formed a joint venture named Venture One in Fair Lawn, New Jersey. The company conducted a market test of 100 homes in Ridgewood, New Jerseyand 100 in Fair Lawn, NJ: to gauge consumer interest in a Videotex-based TV set-top device that would allow consumers to shop at home and receive news, sports, and weather. After concluding the market test, CBS and AT&T; took the data and went their separate ways in pursuit of developing and profiting from this market demand. Prodigy was founded on February 13, 1984, as Trintex, a joint venture between CBS, computer manufacturer IBM, and retailer Sears, Roebuck and Company.Tom Shea, Big firms team up on videotex project, InfoWorld, 12 March 1984 The company was headed by Theodore Papes, a career IBM executive, until his retirement in 1992. CBS left the venture in 1986 when CBS CEO Tom Wyman was divesting properties outside of CBS's core broadcasting business. The company's service was launched regionally in 1988 in Atlanta, Hartford, and San Francisco under the name Prodigy. The marketing roll-out plan closely followed IBM's Systems Network Architecture (SNA) network backbone. A nationwide launch developed by ad agency J. Walter Thompson and sister company JWT Direct (New York) followed on September 6, 1990. Thanks to an aggressive media marketing campaign, bundling with various consumer-oriented computers such as IBM's PS/1 and PS/2, as well as various clones and Hayes modems, the Prodigy service soon had more than a million subscribers. To handle the traffic, Prodigy built a national network of POP (points of presence) sites that made local access numbers available for most homes in the US. This was a major factor in the expansion of the service since subscribers did not have to dial long-distance to access the service. The subscriber only paid for the local call (usually free), while Prodigy paid for the long-distance call to its national data center in Yorktown, New York.Atlantic magazine: \\"Rebuilding Prodigy\\" July 12, 2014 Development Under the guidance of Henry Heilbrunn, Prodigy developed a fully staffed 24√ó7 newsroom with editors, writers, and graphic artists intent on building the world's first true online medium. The initial result was that Prodigy pioneered the concept of an online content portal‚Äîa single site offering news, weather, sports, communication with other members, and shopping for goods and services such as groceries, general merchandise, brokerage services, and airline reservations. The service provided a number of lifestyle features, including popular syndicated columnists, Zagat restaurant surveys, Consumer Reports articles and test reports, games for kids and adults, in- depth original features called \\"Timely Topics\\", bulletin boards moderated by subject matter experts, movie reviews, and e-mail. Working with Heilbrunn in the early stages of Prodigy's design, Bob Bedard pioneered the business model for electronic commerce. Prodigy was the service that launched ESPN's online presence. Prodigy quickly implemented the use of diskette-based application common code modules (predecessor of MS Client Runtime Library (CLR) architecture). These pre-installed diskette-based applications were loaded from the Prodigy Service diskette. These modules then relied upon real-time tokenized data transmitted from Prodigy database servers to drive core Prodigy service functionality on local user PCs. This client-server design worked well, since by staging application-specific and reusable common code modules on Prodigy end-user distribution diskettes, this key design point allowed millisecond \\"click-to-available-cursor\\" response times otherwise unachievable in 1986 over slow 1,200-to-2,400 bit/s modems. The service was presented using a graphical user interface. The Data Object Architecture wrapped vector and incremental point graphics, encoded as per the North American Presentation Level Protocol Syntax NAPLPS, along with interpretative programs written in the proprietary languages TBOL (Trintex Basic Object Language) and PAL (Prodigy Application Language). NAPLPS grew out of the Canadian Telidon project, becoming an international standard in 1983 after some extensions were added by AT&T; Corporation. NAPLPS enabled the display of colors and graphics in support of electronic advertising, publishing and commerce. The initial emphasis was on DOS and later Microsoft Windows. Users could use Apple Macintosh, but the Prodigy screens were not always configured to the Mac standard, resulting in wasted space or cut-off graphics. Prodigy's initial business model relied more on advertising and online shopping for cash flow than monthly subscriptions. Subscribers were charged a flat monthly fee that provided unlimited access. Initially, a monthly rate was charged for unlimited usage time and 30 personal messages. Subscribers could purchase additional messages. Later, Prodigy divided its service into \\"Core\\" and \\"Plus\\" sections. Core section usage remained unlimited, but Plus sections were limited by usage time. Subscribers were given a monthly allotment of Plus time. If that time was exceeded, the subscriber incurred additional charges based on usage time. Subscribers could discern what type of section they were in by the blue indicator in the bottom-right corner of the screen. Prodigy's shopping applications initially underperformed relative to expectations. Reasons for difficulty in online shopping for Prodigy included the perception that online shoppers would pay a premium rather than expect discounts for merchandise. Another reason for poor online merchandising was the nature of the graphics presented due to inherent limitations of technology at the time. Using the early NAPLPS graphic standard, it was not possible to render realistic images of products. As such, while commercial clients with presence on the Prodigy Service might have realized a measure of success with an electronic order blank supporting a print catalog, it was otherwise difficult for online merchants to market products. Despite these challenges, Prodigy was largely responsible for helping merchants such as PC Flowers become some of the earliest e-commerce success stories. However, revenue from advertising was limited. By 1993, Prodigy was developing a network architecture that would become known in the modern Internet age as a content delivery network, where the network caches its most frequently accessed content as close as possible to the users. The company sold private versions of this for use within a customer's private corporate network. Price increases Two of Prodigy's most popular services turned out to be its message boards and email. Because Prodigy's business model depended on rapidly growing advertising and online shopping revenue, email was developed primarily to aid shopping, not for general communication between users, which is what it became. The message boards resulted in users being connected to the service far longer than projected. This resulted in higher than expected expenses, adversely affecting the service's cash flow and profitability. To control costs and raise revenue, Prodigy took two separate actions. First, in January 1991, Prodigy modified their basic subscriber plans by allowing only 30 email messages free each month, while charging 25 cents for each additional email message‚Äîa policy that was later rescinded. In the summer of 1993, it began charging hourly rates for several of its most popular features, including its most popular feature, the message boards. This policy was later rescinded after tens of thousands of members left the service. The price increases prompted an increase of \\"underground IDs\\" (known as 'UG's for shorthand)‚Äîwhere multiple users shared a single account that they turned into private bulletin boards by using emails that were returned (and therefore not billed) due to invalid email addresses. Those invalid addresses were the simple names of the person or people for whom the messages were intended. When those people signed in and checked the email, they would find \\"returned\\" messages with their names. They would then \\"send\\" a reply by typing the name of the first sender, which would also be returned. When that person logged on next, they would see their message, and the cycle would repeat. Prodigy was slow to adopt features that made its rival AOL appealing, such as anonymous handles, and real-time chat Eventually, the emergence of the Internet and the World Wide Web threatened to leave Prodigy behind. Conversion to a true ISP In 1994, Prodigy became the first of the early-generation dialup services to offer full access to the World Wide Web and to offer Web page hosting to its members. Since Prodigy was not a true Internet service provider, programs that needed an Internet connection, such as Internet Explorer and Quake multiplayer, could not be used with the service. Prodigy developed its own web browser, but it compared poorly to other mainstream browsers in features. In 1995/1996 Prodigy hired Ed Bennett and Will Lansing. In 1995 through 1996 Prodigy unveiled several Internet- related products. It debuted its own real-time chat area within the service similar to AOL's. Access to USENET newsgroups was made available to Prodigy members via the Prodigy interface software. Also, Prodigy's first web presence, called Astranet, was released shortly thereafter. Astranet was to be a web-based news and information service and supported in part by advertising, though the site was considered experimental and never fully worked out its offering or business model. Another innovation was Skimmer‚Äîa market trial ISP service which became the base for the Prodigy Internet. In 1996, with Gregory C. Carr as chair, the company retooled itself as a true Internet service provider, making its main offering Internet access branded as Prodigy Internet. This new service featured personalized web content, news alerts to pagers and Java chat. At the same time Prodigy de-emphasized its antiquated proprietary interface and its own editorial content, which were re-badged as Prodigy Classic. Prodigy Classic was discontinued in November 1999 with the official explanation that its aging software was not Y2K compliant. The service had 209,000 members when it was discontinued. A public company In 1996, Prodigy was acquired by the former founders of Boston Technology and their new firm International Wireless, with Mexican businessman Carlos Slim Hel√∫, a principal owner of Telmex, as a minority investor. IBM and Sears sold their interests to this group for $200 million. It was estimated that IBM and Sears had invested more than $1 billion in the service since its founding.Lewis, Peter H. \\"Sears, I.B.M. Near a Deal To Sell Prodigy\\". The New York Times, May 8, 1996. Accessed November 13, 2007. \\"A person familiar with the agreement said I.B.M. and Sears had agreed to accept as little as $100 million for Prodigy, in effect writing off more than $1 billion they had invested in the on-line venture during the last decade.\\" Prodigy continued to operate as before, while Telmex provided Internet access under the Prodigy brand in Mexico and other parts of Latin America, with some services being provided by Prodigy Communications in the US. Prodigy went public in 1999, trading on the NASDAQ under the symbol PRGY.PRGY. Google Finance. Later that year, Prodigy entered a strategic partnership with SBC Communications wherein Prodigy would provide Internet services and SBC would provide exclusive sales opportunities and network, particularly DSL, facilities. The strategic partnership also gave SBC a 43% ownership interest in Prodigy. On November 6, 2001, SBC purchased 100% interest in Prodigy and brought it private. On November 14, 2001, SBC and Yahoo! announced the strategic alliance to create the co-branded SBC Yahoo!. Sometime thereafter, SBC ceased offering new Prodigy accounts, and customers were encouraged to migrate to the SBC Yahoo! product line to the sbc.yahoo.com internet portal, while being able to keep their {username}@Prodigy.net email addresses.

When Prodigy moved to per-hour charging for its most popular services in June 1993, tens of thousands of users left the service. Prodigy was also one of the first online services to offer a user-friendly GUI when competing services, such as CompuServe and GEnie, were still text-based. Prodigy used this graphical capability to deploy advertising, which it expected would result in a significant revenue stream. Prodigy offered online banking, stock trading, advertising and online shopping before the World Wide Web became widely used, but was largely unable to capitalize on these \\"early mover\\" advantages. Decades later, however, IBM continues to sell licenses for basic concepts of ecommerce. Prodigy was a forerunner in caching data on and near the users' personal computers to minimize networking and server expenses while improving the experience for users.U.S. Patent 5,594,910 Prodigy's legacy architecture was novel at the time and anticipated much of current web browser technology. It leveraged the power of the subscriber's PC to maintain session state, handle the user interface, and process applications formed from data and interpretative program objects which were largely pulled from the network when needed. At a time when in the state of the art, distributed objects were handled by RPC equivalents (remote function calls to well known servers in which final results were returned to the caller), Prodigy pioneered the concept of actually returning interpretable, \\"platform independent\\" objects to the caller for subsequent processing. U.S. Patent 5,347,632 This approach anticipated such things as Java applets and JavaScript.

Accessed November 28, 2007. Prodigy also helped pioneer true distributed object-oriented client-server implementations as well as incidental innovations such as the equivalent of HTML Frames, pre-fetch, etc. U.S. patent 6,275,852 Prodigy patented its implementation (US 5,347,632 et al.) and these patents are highly cited among software patents. Growth and decline By 1994, Prodigy became a pioneer in selling \\"dial-up\\" connections to the World-Wide Web, and sold hosting services for Web publishers. In 1999 the company, now led by a cadre of ex-MCI executives with the goal of turning the brand around, became Prodigy Internet, marketing a full range of services, applications and content, including dial-up and DSL for consumers and small businesses, instant messaging, e-mail, and communities. In 2000, with subscriber growth exploding and brand attributes at an all-time high, Prodigy explored a number of partnership deals including what would have been an unprecedented three-way merger with Earthlink and Mindspring. Ultimately, SBC bought a 43% interest in the company, and Prodigy became the exclusive provider to SBC's 77 million high-speed Internet customers. More than a year later after the launch of Prodigy Broadband (conceived and led by Chris Spanos), SBC bought controlling interest for $465 million when Prodigy was the fourth-largest Internet service provider behind America Online, Microsoft's MSN, and EarthLink. Prodigy in 2000 was reported to have 3.1 million subscribers of its own, of which 1.3 million were DSL customers. Attempts by SBC to sell the Prodigy brand became public knowledge on December 9, 2005. In late 2006, SBC purchased AT&T; Corporation and re-branded itself as AT&T; Inc. As of early 2007, there remained within AT&T;'s Internet operations a small group of former Prodigy employees located in AT&T;'s Austin, Texas, and White Plains, New York, facilities. What had started 27 years earlier as an AT&T; online experiment had come full circle. Through 2009, the domain www.prodigy.net redirected to my.att.net, which appeared to be a Yahoo!-based content and search portal linking mostly to other online services. AT&T; stopped serving Prodigy-created webpages in 2011, severing yet another tie with the brand. As of July 2019, http://www.prodigy.net/ serves up an error message with no content (The webpage cannot be found: HTTP 400). Though the company maintains customer's legacy email addresses. Prodigy in Mexico In Mexico, Prodigy Internet is the main ISP with an estimated 92% of market share. It is also the leader in WiFi (hotspots) and broadband (DSL) access.

He was the lead singer of the band Blind Melon from 1990 until his death in 1995.Death of lead singer Shannon Hoon hasn't stopped Blind Melon's music JOHN WIRT. Advocate ‚Äì Baton Rouge, La. November 8, 1995 Early life Hoon was born in Lafayette, Indiana and raised in nearby Dayton, Indiana with his half-sister, Anna, and half-brother, Tim. He reportedly began using his middle name, Shannon, to avoid confusion with his father, who was also named Richard. In high school, he played football, wrestled, and was a pole vaulter. Shannon's musical influences included the Grateful Dead, The Beatles, John Lennon, and Bob Dylan. After graduating from McCutcheon High School in 1985, Hoon joined a local glam metal band named Styff Kytten, which also featured guitarist Michael Kelsey. He took on the role of frontman and lead singer of the band. It was around this time that he wrote his first song and called it \\"Change.\\" He was also a member of the Lafayette band Mank Rage, along with David Lank and Darren Mickler, during this time. Blind Melon In 1985, Hoon, 18, left Indiana for Los Angeles. In Los Angeles, he met musicians Brad Smith and Rogers Stevens at a party. Smith and Stevens saw Hoon perform his song \\"Change\\" acoustically and invited Hoon to play with them. Christopher Thorn and Glen Graham were then brought into the fold, and by 1990 the five musicians decided to form Blind Melon. The band was possibly named for a term Smith's father used to describe the neighborhood stoners; or for Blind Melon Chitlin, a character from a Cheech & Chong album. In 1990, the new bandmates produced a four-song demo tape and subsequently signed a $500,000 recording contract with Capitol Records. In Los Angeles, Hoon befriended his sister Anna's high school friend, Axl Rose. Rose invited Hoon to join him in the studio, where his band Guns N' Roses were recording their albums Use Your Illusion I and Use Your Illusion II (both released in 1991). Hoon sang backing vocals on several of the tracks, including \\"The Garden\\" and \\"Don't Cry.\\" Rose also invited Hoon to appear in the video for \\"Don't Cry.\\" In 1992, Blind Melon released their self-titled debut album produced by Pearl Jam producer Rick Parashar. Blind Melon began touring to promote the album, supporting and opening for acts like Ozzy Osbourne, Guns N' Roses, and Soundgarden over the course of 1992‚Äì1993. In the summer of 1993, the video for the album track \\"No Rain\\" was released as a single. The video for \\"No Rain\\" focused on a theme of the \\"normal\\" crowd versus the lonely outcast. It featured a young girl, played by Heather DeLoach, in a bee costume, tap dancing to unappreciative audiences, who finally finds an entire crowd of people similarly dressed who welcome her. The video is often referred to as the 'Bee Girl'. Blind Melon went multi-platinum. Hoon and Blind Melon spent the next two years touring. In 1993, Hoon was arrested for indecent exposure after he disrobed onstage and urinated on a fan at a show in Vancouver.Promoter Tears Strip Off Naked Rocker , Pamela Fayerman, Vancouver Sun, November 2, 199w. Retrieved 2010-08-17. In 1994, Blind Melon appeared at Woodstock '94 where Hoon, allegedly high on LSD, went onstage wearing his girlfriend's white dress. After taking a hiatus from touring, Blind Melon returned to the studio to record the album Soup in New Orleans. Soup was released in 1995. Personal life and death Gravesite of Shannon Hoon On July 11, 1995, Hoon and his girlfriend, Lisa Crouse, had a daughter named Nico Blue. Before the birth of his daughter, Hoon entered rehab again. In August, Blind Melon planned to tour to support their album Soup, so Hoon allowed a drug counselor to accompany him on the road. After a disappointing performance at Numbers in Houston on October 20, Hoon launched himself into an all-night drug binge. The next day, Saturday, October 21, 1995, Blind Melon was scheduled to play a show in New Orleans at Tipitina's. The band's sound engineer, Lyle Eaves, went to the tour bus to awaken Hoon for a sound check, but Hoon was unresponsive. An ambulance arrived, and Hoon was pronounced dead at the scene, at the age of 28. His death was attributed to a cocaine overdose. Hoon was buried at Dayton Cemetery in Dayton, Indiana. His grave is inscribed with a line from Blind Melon's song \\"Change\\", the first song he wrote: Legacy and aftermath On November 12, 1996, Blind Melon released their final album featuring Hoon, Nico, as a tribute to him with all proceeds going to his daughter and to programs helping musicians deal with drug problems. The band also released a video called \\"Letters from a Porcupine\\" that was nominated for Best Long Form Music Video at the Grammy Awards on February 25, 1997. Blind Melon remained active for the next four years following Hoon's death. The remaining members had planned to continue the band in memory of him and auditions to fill the vacant singer position were held. However, they never managed to find a permanent replacement for Hoon, and Blind Melon officially disbanded in 1999. After years of refusing to perform together out of respect for Hoon, the surviving members reformed Blind Melon in 2006, with Travis Warren taking his place. On September 17, 2008, the book A Devil on One Shoulder and an Angel on the Other: The Story of Shannon Hoon and Blind Melon by Greg Prato was published.A Devil on One Shoulder and an Angel on the Other: The Story of Shannon Hoon and: Greg Prato: 9780615252391: Amazon.com: Books On September 15, 2018, photos of Hoon's final performance with Blind Melon at the Numbers club in Houston on October 20, 1995, the day before he died, were released for the first time by fan Zak Joshua Rose, who took the pictures and claimed that he hung out with the band members except Hoon (who had disappeared) after the show.

Early life and education  Kyl was born in Wisner, Nebraska, the son of Johanna (n√©e Boonstra) and Jon George Kyl, both Dutch immigrants. He graduated from Nebraska State Teachers College (Wayne, Nebraska) and the University of Nebraska.  Career  Kyl was a teacher at Nebraska State Teachers College from 1940 to 1950. In the 1950s, he moved to Bloomfield, Iowa where he joined his brother George in the clothing business. He also worked as a television journalist for KTVO in Ottumwa, Iowa. Kyl ran for the U.S. House of Representatives in 1958, losing to incumbent Steven V. Carter. However, Carter died on November 4, 1959 after less than one year in office. Kyl then won a special election to fill the vacancy. He continued to serve as the representative from Iowa's 4th congressional district for two additional terms, but was defeated in the 1964 United States House of Representatives elections, in which Democrats gained 36 seats in the House. He recaptured his former seat in 1966, and then won re- election in 1968 and 1970. Reapportionment after the 1970 census put him into the same district as incumbent Democrat Neal Edward Smith, who defeated him in the 1972 election. From 1973 to 1977, he served as Assistant Secretary for Congressional and Legislative Affairs in the United States Department of the Interior.  Personal life  Kyl was married to Arlene (n√©e Griffith), with whom he had three children, including Jon Kyl. Jon went on to serve as a two- time U.S. Senator from Arizona, from 1995 to 2013 and briefly in 2018. He also served as Senate Minority Whip.

His guitar work was rooted in funk and hard rock, and he often experimented with other genres including reggae and speed metal. He is considered to have been a major influence on the Red Hot Chili Peppers' early sound. Born in Haifa, Israel, he moved to Nahariya and later to Kibbutz before emigrating to the United States with his family in 1967. Slovak met future bandmates Anthony Kiedis, Flea, and Jack Irons while attending Fairfax High School in Los Angeles. There, he formed the group What Is This? with Irons, Alain Johannes and Todd Strassman; Flea later replaced Strassman. Slovak, Flea, Kiedis, and Irons founded Red Hot Chili Peppers in 1982, gaining popularity in Los Angeles through their energetic stage presence and spirited performances. Slovak eventually quit to focus on What is This?, which had been signed to a record deal, leaving the Red Hot Chili Peppers to record their 1984 debut album without him, including five songs co-written by him. He rejoined the Chili Peppers in 1985, and recorded the albums Freaky Styley (1985) and The Uplift Mofo Party Plan (1987) with them. During his career, Slovak developed a serious heroin addiction. He attempted to quit many times, but died of an overdose on June 25, 1988 at age 26. Several Red Hot Chili Peppers songs have been written as tributes to Slovak, including \\"Otherside\\", \\"Knock Me Down\\", \\"My Lovely Man\\", \\"This Is the Place\\", \\"Dosed\\" and \\"Feasting on the Flowers\\". In 1999, his brother James Slovak published a book, Behind the Sun: The Diary and Art of Hillel Slovak, which features Slovak's diaries and paintings. Slovak was posthumously inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a member of the Red Hot Chili Peppers on April 14, 2012, with his brother accepting the award on his behalf. Life and career =1962-80: Early life and Anthym= Hillel Slovak was born in Haifa, Israel, to Jewish parents who were survivors of the Holocaust. They settled in the Queens borough of New York City, then in 1967 relocated to Southern California. As a child, Slovak developed an interest in art, and often spent time painting with his mother, Esther.Slovak, 1999. p. 37 He attended Laurel Elementary School in West Hollywood and Bancroft Jr. High School in Hollywood, where he met future bandmates Jack Irons and Michael \\"Flea\\" Balzary. Slovak received his first guitar at age 13 as a bar mitzvah present, and regularly played the instrument into the late hours of the night. During this time, he was highly influenced by hard rock music such as Jimi Hendrix, Led Zeppelin, and Kiss. As a freshman at Fairfax High School, Slovak formed a band with Irons on drums and two other high school friends, Alain Johannes and Todd Strassman. They called their band Chain Reaction, then changed the name to Anthem after their first gig. After one of the group's shows, Slovak met audience member Anthony Kiedis, and invited him to his house for a snack.Kiedis, Sloman, 2004. p. 64. Kiedis later described the experience in his autobiography Scar Tissue: \\"Within a few minutes of hanging out with Hillel, I sensed that he was absolutely different from most of the people I'd spent time with ... He understood a lot about music, he was a great visual artist, and he had a sense of self and a calm about him that were just riveting.\\" Slovak, Kiedis and Flea became best friends and often used LSD, heroin, cocaine and methamphetamine recreationally. The original bassist for Anthem, which renamed to Anthym, was deemed unsatisfactory, so Slovak began teaching Flea to play bass.Apter, 2004. pp. 40‚Äì45 Following several months of commitment to the instrument, Flea developed proficiency and a strong musical chemistry with Slovak. When Strassman saw Flea playing Anthym songs on his equipment he quit the band, with Flea quickly replacing him.Kiedis, Sloman, 2004. pp. 72-73 Shortly afterwards Anthym entered a local Battle of the Bands contest and won second place. Anthym started to play at local nightclubs, despite the fact that the members were all underage. After graduating from high school, the band changed their name to What Is This?. Flea left Anthym around this time to accept an offer of playing bass in the prominent L.A. punk band Fear. What Is This? continued on and performed many shows along the California coast.Mullen, 2010. p. 21 =1980-82: Red Hot Chili Peppers formation= Red Hot Chili Peppers performing in Indianapolis with Slovak on the right. Slovak, Kiedis, and Flea began to create their own music after finding inspiration in a punk-funk fusion band called Defunkt.Page, Scarlet (July, 2004). \\"Red Hot Chili Peppers: The LA Punks Who Defied Death, Grunge And A Burning Crack Den\\". Mojo. The three formed a band with former Anthym- drummer Jack Irons called Tony Flow and the Miraculously Majestic Masters of Mayhem. The band had only one song, entitled \\"Out in L.A.\\", and was formed for the purpose of playing the song once.Apter, 2004. p. 60 The song was based on a guitar riff that Slovak wrote while \\"jamming\\" with Irons, and was not meant to become a real song until Kiedis decided to rap over the music.Mullen, 2010. p. 16 Following the group's first show at The Rhythm Lounge, the owner of the bar asked them to return, but with two songs instead of one. After several more shows, and the addition of several songs to their repertoire, the band's name was changed to Red Hot Chili Peppers.Apter, 2004. p. 61 After the band started to gain popularity amongst the L.A. club scene, Kiedis began writing more lyrics. The lyrics would eventually become songs such as \\"Green Heaven\\" and \\"True Men Don't Kill Coyotes\\", and the band's concert repertoire quickly grew to nine songs as a result of months of playing local nightclubs and bars.Apter, 2004. p. 62 Over the course of the next six months, the Red Hot Chili Peppers played many shows in L.A. clubs and became something of an underground hit. Slovak, Kiedis, and Flea moved into a small house, now owned by author, Jacob Gerhardt, in a high-crime area in Hollywood where they collaborated musically and continued their drug addictions.Kiedis, Sloman, 2004. p. 108 The threesome traveled to New York City to perform more shows and to \\"spread Chili Pepperdom\\".Kiedis, Sloman, 2004. p. 115 Shortly after the trip, Slovak moved out of the group's shared house to live with his girlfriend.Kiedis, Sloman, 2004. p. 117 =1983-88: What is This? stint, Freaky Styley, and The Uplift Mofo Party Plan= The Red Hot Chili Peppers entered Bijou Studios to record a demo tape and subsequently secured a record deal with EMI. Flea left Fear to pursue the Red Hot Chili Peppers. At the same time, What is This? had also gotten a record deal. Since Slovak considered the Chili Peppers to merely be a side project and not a serious commitment, he left them to concentrate on What is This?.Apter, 2004. pp. 70‚Äì74 Flea ultimately respected the decision, but felt the band would suffer musically without him and Irons. He and Kiedis hired drummer Cliff Martinez and guitarist Jack Sherman to fill Irons' and Slovak's places, respectively. During the recording of the second What is This? album, Slovak became frustrated with the band and contacted Flea about rejoining the Red Hot Chili Peppers. This came at an opportune time, as the group was dissatisfied with Slovak's replacement, Jack Sherman. Kiedis felt that Sherman's guitar work \\"didn't have the same spirit\\" that Slovak contributed to the band's sound.Kiedis, Sloman, 2004. p. 132 When Flea asked Kiedis how he felt about Slovak rejoining the band, Kiedis responded by saying, \\"I'd give my firstborn son to get him back in the band.\\"Kiedis, Sloman, 2004. p. 162 After the culmination of the promotional tour for their first album, Sherman was fired and Slovak rejoined the band. Slovak returned to the Chili Peppers for their second album, Freaky Styley, which was released on August 16, 1985. What is This? had finally disbanded, and Irons returned to the Chili Peppers in mid 1986 after Martinez was fired. Flea, Slovak and Kiedis especially were involved in heavy drug use and their relationships became strained. Flea recalled that \\"it began to seem ugly to me and not fun; our communication was not healthy\\".Apter, 2004. p. 133 Kiedis became dependent on heroin, leaving the rest of the group to work on much of the album's material by themselves. The band lived in Detroit for a portion of the recording of the album, where Kiedis and Slovak indulged in heavy cocaine use. When Slovak was under the influence, he would often wear brightly colored clothing and dance in a \\"shuffling\\" fashion, which became the inspiration for the song \\"Skinny Sweaty Man\\" from the band's next album.Slovak, 1999. p. 110 After Kiedis completed a stint in rehab, he rejoined the Red Hot Chili Peppers in Los Angeles to record their third album The Uplift Mofo Party Plan. Slovak felt a deep connection to the album; he reflected in his diary \\"It was so fun. I'm so extremely proud of everybody's work--it is at times genius.\\"Slovak, 1999. p. 65 Slovak was the subject of the songs \\"Skinny Sweaty Man\\", \\"Me and My Friends\\", & \\"No Chump Love Sucker\\".Kiedis, Sloman, 2004. pp. 203‚Äì204 He was nicknamed \\"Slim Bob Billy\\", \\"Slim\\", or \\"Huckleberry\\", and throughout the albums Kiedis calls him by these nicknames before he starts a guitar solo. On The Uplift Mofo Party Plan, Slovak experimented with different musical styles, playing the sitar on the song \\"Behind the Sun\\". Health decline =Heroin addiction= Slovak and Kiedis became addicted to heroin early in their careers, and Slovak often attempted to conceal his addiction from his friends and family. The band was generally more worried about Kiedis' addiction, which was much more open and noticeable to the other members, while Slovak according to Kiedis was \\"much more subtle and much more cunning in his disguise.\\" During the tour in support of Freaky Styley, Slovak's health began to deteriorate. Slovak and Flea would wrestle regularly on tour, but Slovak became too weak to participate. Kiedis commented on the situation: \\"I could tell that Hillel had no inner core of strength; he had been robbed by his addiction of the life force that allows you to at least defend yourself. It was a sad moment.\\"Kiedis, Sloman, 2004. p. 180 A roadie of the band who was concerned for Slovak's health contacted his brother, James, who had been unaware that Slovak had ever used heroin. Deciding to give sobriety a chance, both Kiedis and Slovak stopped using drugs prior to their European tour in support of The Uplift Mofo Party Plan, and decided to help each other \\"steer clear\\" of heroin.Kiedis, Sloman, 2004. p. 208 An entry from Slovak's diary on January 21, 1988 discusses his attempts to \\"begin a new drug-free phase of life\\".Slovak, 1999. p. 9 During the tour both experienced intense heroin withdrawal, with Slovak much more unstable than Kiedis. His withdrawal symptoms took a toll on his ability to play his instrument; at one point Slovak had a mental breakdown and was unable to play a show, leaving the rest of the band to play an entire set with no guitar.Kiedis, Sloman, 2004. p. 216 He recovered a few days later, but was briefly kicked out of the band and replaced by DeWayne McKnight for a few shows.Kiedis, Sloman, 2004. p. 219 After a few days with McKnight, the band decided to give Slovak another chance, and he rejoined for the European leg of the tour. Kiedis attempted to take Slovak to drug addiction counseling, but Slovak had difficulty admitting that his addiction was serious enough to require medical help.Kiedis, Sloman, 2004. p. 221 =Death= Upon returning home, Slovak isolated himself from the rest of his bandmates, and struggled to resist the drug without the support of his friends, and Kiedis in particular. He stopped painting and writing in his diary during this time, and little is known about his life during the weeks following the tour, aside from a phone call to his brother on June 24, in which Slovak told him that he was having difficulty staying clean despite his desire to stop taking heroin.Slovak, 1999. p. 6 A few weeks after the band returned from the tour, the members attempted to contact Slovak, but were unable to for several days. Slovak was found dead by police in his Hollywood apartment on June 27, 1988. After his autopsy, authorities determined that he had died two days earlier on June 25 due to a heroin overdose. He is interred at Mount Sinai Memorial Park Cemetery in Hollywood Hills, California. Following Slovak's death Kiedis fled town and did not attend the funeral, considering the situation to be surreal.Kiedis, Sloman, 2004. p. 222 Although he found the death to be a shock, he was not initially \\"scared straight\\" and continued to use heroin.Kiedis, Sloman, 2004. p. 223 However, a few weeks later his friend convinced him both to check into rehab and visit Slovak's grave, which inspired him to get clean.Kiedis, Sloman, 2004. p. 226 Irons was unable to cope with Slovak's death and subsequently quit the band, saying that he did not want to be part of something that resulted in the death of his friend. Irons has suffered from severe depression since Slovak's death. This did not end Irons‚Äô musical career however, as he would work with Johannes on several projects including the band Eleven, and would join Pearl Jam for a period in the 1990s after initially declining to join the band upon its founding. Kiedis and Flea decided to continue making music, hoping to continue what Slovak \\"helped build\\".Kiedis, Sloman, 2004. p. 224 They hired DeWayne McKnight and D.H. Peligro as replacements shortly after. Musical style and legacy Slovak was primarily influenced by hard rock artists such as Jimi Hendrix, Santana, and Led Zeppelin. His playing method was markedly based on improvisation, a style commonly used in funk music. He was also noted for his aggressive playing style; he would often play with such force that his fingers would \\"come apart.\\" Kiedis observed that his playing evolved during his time away from the group in What is This?, with Slovak adopting a more fluid style featuring \\"sultry\\" elements as opposed to his original hard rock techniques.Kiedis, Sloman, p. 168 On Uplift, Slovak experimented with genres outside of traditional funk music including reggae and speed metal.Kiedis, Sloman, 2004. p. 204 His guitar riffs would often serve as the basis of the group's songs, with the other members writing their parts to complement his guitar work. His melodic riff featured in the song \\"Behind the Sun\\" inspired the group to create \\"pretty\\" songs with an emphasis on melody. Kiedis describes the song as \\"pure Hillel inspiration\\".Slovak, 1999. p. 12 Slovak also used a talk box on songs such as \\"Green Heaven\\" and \\"Funky Crime\\", in which the sounds of his amplified guitar would be played through a tube into his mouth and then back into a microphone, creating psychedelic, voice-like effects.Kiedis, Sloman, 2004. p. 112 Slovak helped to incorporate new sounds in the group's work, including adding occasional drum machines. Despite the fact that the group billed itself as \\"The Organic Anti-Beat Box Band\\", Kiedis states that Slovak showed the group that drum machines could be used as artistic instruments.Mullen, 2010. p. 35 Slovak's work was one of the major contributing factors to the Red Hot Chili Peppers' early sound. When Kiedis and Flea were searching for a new guitarist to replace Slovak, Kiedis likened the experience to \\"shopping for a new Mom and Dad\\" because of his influence over the band.Kiedis, Sloman, 2004. p. 126 Flea, who originally listened exclusively to jazz, added that Slovak introduced him to a new genre of music, saying that \\"it was Hillel who first got me into hard rockin. He was also a huge influence on a young John Frusciante, who would later replace him as guitarist in the band. Frusciante based a lot of his playing style on Slovak's work, and explained, \\"I learned everything I needed to know about how to sound good with Flea by studying Hillel's playing and I just took it sideways from there.\\"Apter, 2004, p. 181. Just like Slovak before him, Frusciante developed a heroin addiction. Unlike Slovak, Frusciante eventually managed to break and defeat the habit. The songs \\"Knock Me Down\\" (from Mother's Milk), \\"My Lovely Man\\" (from Blood Sugar Sex Magik), \\"This is the Place\\" (from By the Way), and \\"Feasting on the Flowers\\" (from The Getaway) were written about or as tributes to Slovak.Kiedis, Sloman, 2004. p. 273 The band's 1987 cover version of Jimi Hendrix's song \\"Fire\\", recorded with Slovak and previously only released on the \\"Fight Like a Brave\\" single and The Abbey Road EP, was included on 1989's Mother's Milk along with an image of one of Slovak's paintings inside the album's booklet. In 1999, a book titled Behind the Sun: The Diary and Art of Hillel Slovak was published. The book was authored by Slovak's brother, James Slovak, and features writings from his brother's diaries, paintings, photos and hand-written notes from Kiedis and Flea. On December 7, 2011, the Red Hot Chili Peppers were announced as 2012 inductees to the Rock And Roll Hall Of Fame. Slovak's brother James accepted the award on his behalf and gave a speech honoring his brother. In an interview with Rolling Stone, Kiedis expressed his excitement with Slovak's induction, explaining \\"He's a beautiful person that picked up a guitar in the 1970s and didn't make it out of the 1980s, and he is getting honored for his beauty\\". Flea echoed those comments on the same day: \\"Hillel grew up loving rock and roll so much, he hasn't been here for some time, but I know how much it would mean to him. It's a powerful thing.\\" Discography ;With Addie Brik *Wattsland - EP ‚Äì (1984) ;With What Is This? *Squeezed - EP ‚Äì (1984) *What Is This ‚Äì (1985) *3 Out Of 5 Live - EP ‚Äì (1985) ;With Red Hot Chili Peppers *The Red Hot Chili Peppers ‚Äì (1984) **Co- wrote \\"Baby Appeal\\", \\"Get Up and Jump\\", \\"Green Heaven\\", \\"Out in L.A.\\", and \\"Police Helicopter\\" *Freaky Styley ‚Äì (1985) *The Uplift Mofo Party Plan ‚Äì (1987) *The Abbey Road E.P. ‚Äì (1988) *Mother's Milk ‚Äì (1989) **Performs on only one track, \\"Fire\\" *What Hits!? ‚Äì (1992) *Out in L.A. ‚Äì (1994) *Under the Covers: Essential Red Hot Chili Peppers ‚Äì (1998) *The Best of Red Hot Chili Peppers ‚Äì (1994) References =Notes= =Sources=  * Category:1962 births Category:1988 deaths Category:20th-century American musicians Category:American funk guitarists Category:American male guitarists Category:American people of Croatian-Jewish descent Category:American people of Polish-Jewish descent Category:American rock guitarists Category:Israeli musicians Category:Israeli guitarists Category:Fairfax High School (Los Angeles) alumni Category:Israeli emigrants to the United States Category:Israeli people of Croatian-Jewish descent Category:Israeli people of Polish-Jewish descent Category:Jewish American musicians Category:Lead guitarists Category:Musicians from Haifa Category:Red Hot Chili Peppers members Category:Sitar players Category:What Is This? members Category:Deaths by heroin overdose in California Category:Burials at Mount Sinai Memorial Park Cemetery Category:Jews in punk rock Category:Jewish heavy metal musicians Category:20th-century American guitarists ","title":"Hillel Slovak"},{"id":"340596","text":"Lagentium or Legiolum was the Roman name for the fort and surrounding civilian settlement which was built around the year 74 by the Roman Empire. The English town of Castleford, West Yorkshire, is now built on what was the fort.  Etymology  The name Lagentium may be of Brittonic origin. The name may involve the element lagƒ´nƒÅ-, with connotations of \\"spear\\" and \\"blade\\", with the suffix -tjo- affixed. Andrew Breeze revived the proffering that Lagentium was based on an ethnic name.  History  Around this time, the Romans defeated the Brigantes, a peaceful, farming people. The Romans named this new settlement Lagentium. They built a turf and timber fort sometime in the early 70s to guard the river crossings and the vital road to the north. The fort was built on either a natural ridge or a man-made mound, we are not certain. The Roman engineers chose Lagentium for its strongly strategic position. The mound offered a strong and clear vantage point, and the river offered a source of water and food. The low crossing point also had the advantage that both sides of the river could be farmed on. So a fort was built on top of a Brigantian settlement. Over the sixty years since the fort was built, permanent shops and gardens were built, and traders began to arrive. The fort was garrisoned for 24 years by the Roman army, to keep the Brigantes under control. The Romans simply believed that the Brigantes were 'barbarians', but peace was eventually established and the troops were moved to the north. The Brigantes were not the most advanced of British Tribes, but the few Brigantes that did accept Roman law were allowed to experience greatly enhanced living conditions, under the watchful eye of the Romans. Around 43, a road known as Ermine Street ran from the south to the north, but the Romans had to cross the Humber estuary to get to the other side of the road. The estuary was two miles wide, and the river had raging currents, and was subject to strong winds, making any crossing very difficult. Also, the Romans were not keen sailors, so this route north was not appropriate. So the Romans built another road, locally known as Roman Ridge and often considered a branch of Dere Street or Watling Street, with numerous forts strategically positioned along it. Lagentium, along with what is now Littleborough, Bawtry, Tadcaster and Doncaster, was one of these forts. The fort built in Castleford shared many of the luxuries of any Roman settlement. In the vicus (a settlement just outside the fort) there were temples, houses, shops, alehouses (public house), public bathhouses and brothels. Many other improvements were made to Lagentium, including straight metalled roads, rectangular stone buildings with tiled roofs and glazed windows; the houses had drains and sometimes central heating. Around 180 Lagentium was abandoned, as the Roman Empire withdrew its legions. The Brigantes returned to power and reoccupied Lagentium around 250, Their culture, now called Romano-British, had been profoundly influenced by that of the Romans. There were no significant changes from the time the Romans had left to the Middle Ages. The Brigantes allowed the fort to grow over, and they continued with the farming way of life that they had had for centuries. After the Norman Conquest of England in 1066: the land was split up and given to the King's knights. The land in Castleford, Pontefract, Leeds, Wakefield and Morley was given to Ilbert de Lacey. Castleford continued to be a farming village, and remained as one until the industrial revolution.

Description Zinnias are annuals, shrubs, and sub-shrubs native primarily to North America, with a few species in South America. Most species have upright stems but some have a lax habit with spreading stems that mound over the surface of the ground. They typically range in height from 10 to 100 cm tall (4\\" to 40\\"). The leaves are opposite and usually stalkless (sessile), with a shape ranging from linear to ovate, and a color ranging from pale to medium green. The flowers have a range of appearances, from a single row of petals to a dome shape. Zinnias may be white, chartreuse, yellow, orange, red, purple, or lilac. Cultivation Zinnias are easy to grow with potential heavy blooms that gush in color. Their petals can take different forms as single row with a visible center (Single-flowered zinnia), numerous rows with a center that is not visible (Double-flowered) and petals that are somewhere in-between with numerous rows but visible centers (Semi double-flowered zinnia). Their flowers can also take several shapes. Zinnias are an annual plant that preferably grows in situ from seed, as they dislike being transplanted. Much like daisies, zinnias prefer to have full sunlight and adequate water. In the preferred conditions they will grow quickly but are sensitive to frost and therefore will die after the first frost of autumn. Zinnias benefit from deadheading to encourage further blooming.

Its leaves are lance-shaped and sandpapery in texture, and height ranges from 15 cm to 1 meter. Zinnia angustifolia is another Mexican species. It has a low bushy plant habit, linear foliage, and more delicate flowers than Z. elegans ‚Äì usually single, and in shades of yellow, orange or white. It is also more resistant to powdery mildew than Z. elegans, and hybrids between the two species have been raised which impart this resistance on plants intermediate in appearance between the two. The Profusion series, with both single and double-flowered components, is bred by Sakata of Japan, and is among the most well-known of this hybrid group. Zinnias seem to be a favorite of butterflies as well as hummingbirds, and many gardeners add zinnias specifically to attract them. Uses Zinnias are popular garden flowers because they come in a wide range of flower colors and shapes, and they can withstand hot summer temperatures, and are easy to grow from seeds. They are grown in fertile, humus-rich, and well-drained soil, in an area with full sun. They will reseed themselves each year. Over 100 cultivars have been produced since selective breeding started in the 19th century. Zinnia peruviana was introduced to Europe in the early 1700s. Around 1790 Z. elegans (Zinnia violacea) was introduced and those plants had a single row of ray florets which were violet. In 1829, scarlet flowering plants were available under the name 'Coccinea'. Double flowering types were available in 1858, coming from India, and they were in a range of colors including shades of reds, rose, purple, orange, buff, and rose stripped. In time, they came to represent thinking of absent friends in the language of flowers. A number of species of zinnia are popular flowering plants, and interspecific hybrids are becoming more common. Their varied habits allow for uses in several parts of a garden, and their tendency to attract butterflies and hummingbirds is seen as desirable. Commercially available seeds and plants are derived from open pollinated or F1 crosses, and the first commercial F1 hybrid dates from 1960. Beyond earth Experimentation aboard the International Space Station has demonstrated the capability of zinnias to grow and blossom in a weightless environment. Companion plants In the Americas their ability to attract hummingbirds is also seen as useful as a defense against whiteflies, and therefore zinnias are a desirable companion plant, benefiting plants that are inter-cropped with it. Zinnias are grown in the summertime and bloom all summer long.

There were three main types of nilometers, calibrated in Egyptian cubits: (1) a vertical column, (2) a corridor stairway of steps leading down to the Nile, or (3) a deep well with culvert. If the water level was low, there would be less food. If it was too high, it would be destructive. There was a specific mark that indicated how high the flood should be if the fields were to get good soil. Between July and November, the reaches of the Nile running through Egypt would burst their banks and cover the adjacent flood plain. When the waters receded, around September or October, they left behind a rich alluvial deposit of exceptionally fertile black silt over the croplands. The akhet, or Season of the Inundation, was one of the three seasons into which the ancient Egyptians divided their year. The annual flood was of great importance to Egyptian civilization. A moderate inundation was a vital part of the agricultural cycle; however, a lighter inundation than normal would cause famine, and too much flood water would be equally disastrous, washing away much of the infrastructure built on the flood plain. Records from AD 622-999 indicate that, on average, 28% of the years saw an inundation that fell short of expectations. The ability to predict the volume of the coming inundation was part of the mystique of the Ancient Egyptian priesthood. The same skill also played a political and administrative role, since the quality of the year's flood was used to determine the levels of tax to be paid. This is where the nilometer came into play, with priests monitoring the day-to-day level of the river and announcing the awaited arrival of the summer flood. Designs Elephantine Island The simplest nilometer design is a vertical column submerged in the waters of the river, with marked intervals indicating the depth of the water. One that follows this simple design, albeit housed in an elaborate and ornate stone structure, can still be seen on the island of Rhoda in central Cairo This nilometer visible today dates as far back as AD 861, when the Abbasid caliph al-Mutawakkil ordered its construction, overseen by the astronomer Alfraganus. It was built on a site occupied by an earlier specimen which was seen by the Syrian Orthodox patriarch Dionysius of Tel Mahre in 830. This prior nilometer had been ordered in AD 715 by UsƒÅma b. Zayd b.  øAdƒ´, who was in charge of collecting the land tax (kharaj) in Egypt for the Umayyad caliph SulaymƒÅn ibn  øAbd al-Malik. Conical structure covers the nilometer on southern tip of Rhoda Island in the Nile River at Cairo. The structure is modern but the nilometer dates from 715 AD. The second nilometer design comprises a flight of stairs leading down into the water, with depth markings along the walls. The best known example of this kind can be seen on the island of Elephantine in Aswan, where a stairway of 52 steps leads down to a doorway at the Nile. This location was also particularly important, since for much of Egyptian history, Elephantine marked Egypt's southern border and was therefore the first place where the onset of the annual flood was detected. The most elaborate design involved a channel or culvert that led from the riverbank - often running for a considerable distance - and then fed a well, tank, or cistern. These nilometer wells were most frequently located within the confines of temples, where only the priests and rulers were allowed access. A particularly fine example, with a deep, cylindrical well and a culvert opening in the surrounding wall, can be seen at the Temple of Kom Ombo, to the north of Aswan. Usage While nilometers originated in Pharaonic times, they continued to be used by the later civilizations that held sway in Egypt. Some were constructed in Roman times. In the 20th century, the Nile's annual inundation was first greatly reduced, and then eliminated entirely, with the construction of the Aswan dams. While the Aswan High Dam's impact on Egypt and its agriculture has been controversial for other, more complex reasons, it has also had the additional effect of rendering the nilometer obsolete.

He argues that nondenominationalism encourages a descent of Christianity‚Äîand indeed, all religions‚Äîinto comfortable \\"general moralism\\" rather than being a focus for facing the complexities of churchgoers' culture and spirituality. Prothero further argues that it also encourages ignorance of the Scriptures, lowering the overall religious literacy while increasing the potential for inter-religious misunderstandings and conflict. Baptist ecumenical theologian Steven R. Harmon argues that \\"there's really no such thing\\" as a nondenominational church, because \\"as soon as a supposedly non-denominational church has made decisions about what happens in worship, whom and how they will baptize, how and with what understanding they will celebrate holy communion, what they will teach, who their ministers will be and how they will be ordered, or how they relate to those churches, these decisions have placed the church within the stream of a specific type of denominational tradition.\\"Steven R. Harmon, Ecumenism Means You, Too: Ordinary Christians and the Quest for Christian Unity (Cascade Books, 2010), pp. 61-62. Harmon argues that the cause of Christian unity is best served through denominational traditions, since each \\"has historical connections to the church's catholicity ... and we make progress toward unity when the denominations share their distinctive patterns of catholicity with one another.\\" Presbyterian dogmatic theologian Amy Plantinga Pauw writes that Protestant nondenominational congregations \\"often seem to lack any acknowledgement of their debts and ties to larger church traditions\\" and argues that \\"for now, these non- denominational churches are living off the theological capital of more established Christian communities, including those of denominational Protestantism.\\"Amy Plantinga Pauw, \\"Earthen Vessels: Theological Reflections on North American Denominationalism\\" in Theology in Service to the Church: Global and Ecumenical Perspectives (ed. Allan Hugh Cole: Cascade Books, 2014), p. 82. Pauw considers denominationalism to be a \\"unifying and conserving force in Christianity, nurturing and carrying forward distinctive theological traditions\\" (such as Wesleyanism being supported by Methodist denominations). In 2011, American evangelical professor Ed Stetzer attributed to individualism the reason for the increase in the number of evangelical churches claiming to be non-denominational Christianity.

For 29 years he held the world record for total professional jockey victories. Early life Jayne Mansfield with (left to right) jockeys Johnny Longden, Eddie Arcaro and Willie Shoemaker in 1957 Referred to as \\"Bill\\", \\"Willie,\\" and \\"The Shoe\\", William Lee Shoemaker was born in the town of Fabens, Texas. At 38 ounces (1.1 kg), Shoemaker was so small at birth that he was not expected to survive the night. Put in a shoebox in the oven to stay warm, he survived, but remained small, growing to 4 feet 10 inches (1.47m) and weighing 91 pounds (41 kg). His diminutive size proved an asset as he went on to become a giant in thoroughbred horse racing, despite dropping out of El Monte High School in El Monte, California. Jockey career Shoemaker's career as a jockey began in his teenage years, with his first professional ride on March 19, 1949. The first of his eventual 8,833 career victories came a month later, on April 20, aboard Shafter V, at Golden Gate Fields in Albany, California.About Golden Gate Fields Golden Gate Fields; Retrieved February 7, 2012 In 1951, he won the George Woolf Memorial Jockey Award. At the age of 19, he was making so much money (as much as $2,500 each week) the Los Angeles Superior Court appointed attorney Horace Hahn as his guardian, with the consent of his parents.Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, Saturday, June 2, 1951, pg 11, \\"Shoemaker Makes Too Much Money\\" Thirty years later, he won the Eclipse Award for Outstanding Jockey in the United States. Shoemaker won eleven Triple Crown races during his career, spanning four different decades, but the Crown itself eluded him. The breakdown of these wins is as follows: * Kentucky Derby: Swaps (1955), Tomy Lee (1959), Lucky Debonair (1965) and Ferdinand (1986) * Preakness Stakes: Candy Spots (1963) and Damascus (1967) * Belmont Stakes: Gallant Man (1957), Sword Dancer (1959), Jaipur (1962), Damascus (1967) and Avatar (1975) Two of Shoemaker's most noted rides were in the Kentucky Derby. He lost the 1957 Kentucky Derby aboard Gallant Man, when he stood up in the stirrups too soon, having misjudged the finish line, where Gallant Man finished second to Iron Liege, ridden by Bill Hartack. At the 1986 Kentucky Derby, Shoemaker became the oldest jockey ever to win the race (at age 54) aboard the 18-1 outsider Ferdinand. The following year, he rode Ferdinand to a victory over Alysheba in the Breeders' Cup Classic; Ferdinand later captured Horse of the Year honors. Shoemaker rode the popular California horse Silky Sullivan, about which he is quoted as saying: \\"You just had to let him run his race ... and if he decided to win it, you'd better hold on because you'd be moving faster than a train.\\" When Shoemaker earned his 6,033rd victory in September 1970, he broke jockey Johnny Longden's record. In 1999, Shoemaker's own record of 8,833 career victories was broken by Panamanian-born Laffit Pincay Jr; the record is currently held by Russell Baze. Win number 8,833, Shoemaker's last, came at Gulfstream Park in Hallandale, Florida, on January 20, 1990 aboard Beau Genius. Two weeks later, on February 3, Shoemaker rode his last race on Patchy Groundfog, at Santa Anita Park in Arcadia, California. He finished fourth, in front of a record crowd, to Eddie Delahoussaye, on Exemplary Leader. All told, Bill Shoemaker rode in a record 40,350 races. In 1990, he was voted the Mike Venezia Memorial Award for \\"extraordinary sportsmanship and citizenship\\". The Marlboro Cup of 1976 at Belmont Park proved to be maybe his greatest racing achievement, and it was upon the mighty Forego. Forego's drive started from eighth position out of eleven horses on the backstretch. It culminated with a tremendous charge through the muddy middle-of-the-track stretch run, leading to a victory by a nose over the dead- game Honest Pleasure. Shoemaker was quoted as saying that Forego was the best horse he had ever ridden. After 1990 jockey retirement Soon after retiring as a jockey in 1990, Shoemaker returned to the track as a trainer, where he had modest success, training for such clients as Gulfstream magnate Allen Paulson and composer Burt Bacharach. He continued to train racehorses until his retirement on November 2, 1997. His final stats as a trainer were 90 wins from 714 starters and earnings of $3.7 million. Shoemaker was involved in a solo drunk-driving car accident on April 8, 1991, in San Dimas, California, when he rolled over the Ford Bronco II he was driving. The accident left him paralyzed from the neck down, and he thereafter used a wheelchair. Shoemaker sued Ford, and Ford settled with Shoemaker for US$1,000,000. Shoemaker authored three murder mysteries. They were often compared to the large stable of best-selling horse mysteries by fellow jockey/author Dick Francis. Shoemaker's Stalking Horse (1994), Fire Horse (1995), and Dark Horse (1996) all featured jockey-turned-sleuth Coley Killebrew using his racetrack experience in and about his restaurant and the horse world. Honors Shoemaker was inducted into the National Museum of Racing and Hall of Fame in 1958. He was immortalized as part of a series of portraits by Andy Warhol in the mid-1970s.Rich Mueller, Warhol's Giant 'Sports Cards' for Sale Sports Collectors Daily, April 29, 2007 Further reading * Shoemaker, Bill and Nagler, Barney.

The Hartford Institute for Religion Research defines a megachurch as any Protestant Christian church having 2,000 or more people in average weekend attendance.Bryan S. Turner, The New Blackwell Companion to the Sociology of Religion, John Wiley & Sons, USA, 2010, p. 251 The concept originated in the mid 19th century, continued into the mid 20th century as a phenomenon, and expanded rapidly through the 1980s and 1990s; it is widely seen across the US in the early 21st century. History Baptist Metropolitan Tabernacle, in London The origins of the megachurch movement, with many local congregants who return on a weekly basis, can be traced to the 1800s.Anne C. Loveland, Otis B. Wheeler, From Meetinghouse to Megachurch: A Material and Cultural History, University of Missouri Press, USA, 2003, p. 35 There were large churches earlier in history, but they were considerably rarer. The first evangelical megachurch, the Metropolitan Tabernacle with a 6000-seat auditorium, was inaugurated in 1861 in London by Charles Spurgeon. Stephen J. Hunt, Handbook of Megachurches, Brill, Netherlands, 2019, p. 50 In the United States, in 1923, the Angelus Temple was inaugurated in 1923 with a 5,300-seat auditorium in Los Angeles by Aimee Semple McPherson.

On one weekend in November 2015, around one in ten Protestant churchgoers in the US, or about 5 million people, attended service in a megachurch. 3,000 individual Catholic parishes have 2,000 or more attendants for an average Sunday Mass, but they are not called megachurches as that is a specifically Protestant term. Globally, these large congregations are a significant development in Protestant Christianity.Anne C. Loveland, Otis B. Wheeler, From Meetinghouse to Megachurch: A Material and Cultural History, University of Missouri Press, USA, 2003, p. 3 In the United States, the phenomenon has more than quadrupled in the past two decades. It has since spread worldwide. In 2007, five of the ten largest Protestant churches were in South Korea. The largest megachurch in the world by attendance is South Korea's Yoido Full Gospel Church, an Assemblies of God church, with more than 830,000 members as of 2007.

Didcot is south of Oxford, east of Wantage and north west of Reading. The town is noted for its railway heritage, Didcot station opening as a junction station on the Great Western Main Line in 1844. Today the town is known for its railway museum and former power stations, and is the gateway town to the Science Vale: three large science and technology centres in the surrounding villages of Milton (Milton Park), Culham (Culham Science Centre) and Harwell (Harwell Science and Innovation Campus which includes the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory). In 2017, researchers named Didcot as the most \\"normal\\" town in England. History =Ancient and Medieval eras= The area around present-day Didcot has been inhabited for at least 9,000 years. A large archaeological dig between 2010 and 2013 produced finds from the Mesolithic, Neolithic, Iron Age and Bronze Age. In the Roman era the inhabitants of the area tried to drain the marshland by digging ditches through what is now the Ladygrove area north of the town near Long Wittenham, evidence of which was found during surveying in 1994. A hoard of 126 gold Roman coins dating from about AD 160 was found just outside the village in 1995 by an enthusiast with a metal detector. It is now displayed at the Ashmolean Museum on loan from the British Museum. The Domesday Book of 1086 does not record Didcot. In 13th-century records the toponym appears as Dudecota, Dudecote, Doudecote, Dudcote or Dudecothe. Some of these spellings continued into later centuries, and were joined by Dodecote from the 14th century onward, Dudcott from the 16th century onward and Didcott from the 17th century onward. It is derived from Old English, meaning the house or shelter of Dudda's people. The name is believed to be derived from that of Dida, a 7th-century Mercian sub-king who ruled the area around Oxford and was the father of Saint Frithuswith or Frideswide, now the patron saint of both Oxford and Oxford University. All Saints' parish church, parts of which go back to the 12th century Didcot was then a rural Berkshire village, and it remained so for centuries, only occasionally appearing in records. If Didcot existed at the time of the Domesday Book in 1086, it will have been much smaller than several surrounding villages, including Harwell and Long Wittenham, that modern Didcot now dwarfs. The nearest settlement recorded in the Domesday Book was Wibalditone, with 21 inhabitants and a church, whose name possibly survives in Willington's Farm on the edge of Didcot's present- day Ladygrove Estate. The oldest parts of the Church of England parish church of All Saints go back to the 12th century. They include the walls of the nave and east wall of the chancel, which were built about AD 1160. The church is a Grade II* listed building. =Early modern era= White Cottage, the oldest house in Didcot Parts of the original village survive in the Lydalls Road area around All Saints' church. In the 16th-century Didcot was a small village of landowners, tenants and tradespeople with a population of about 120. The oldest surviving house in Didcot is White Cottage, a 16th-century timber- framed building in Manor Road that has a wood shingle roof. It is a Grade II listed building. At that time the village centre consisted of a group of cottages and surrounding farms around Manor, Foxhall and Lydalls Roads. Those still surviving include The Nook, Thorney Down Cottage and Manor Cottage, which were all built in the early to mid-17th century. Didcot village was on the route between London and Wantage (now Wantage Road), which in 1752 was made a toll road. Didcot had three toll gates that collected revenue for the turnpike trust until 1879, when the trust was dissolved due to the growing use of the railway. =19th and 20th centuries: Introduction of the Railway= Great Western Railway View of the Didcot Power Station in 2005 from Platform 3 of . Three of the cooling towers in the distance were demolished in July 2014, the remaining three in August 2019. The Great Western Railway, engineered by Isambard Kingdom Brunel, reached Didcot in 1839. In 1844 the Brunel-designed Didcot station was opened. The original station burnt down in the late 19th century. Although longer, a cheaper-to-build line to Bristol would have been through Abingdon farther north, but the landowner the first Lord Wantage is reputed to have prevented that alignment. The railway and its junction to assisted the growth of Didcot. The station's name helped to standardise the spelling \\"Didcot\\". Didcot, Newbury and Southampton Railway Didcot's junction of the routes to London, Bristol, Oxford and to Southampton via the Didcot, Newbury and Southampton Railway (DN&S;) made the town militarily important, especially during the First World War campaign on the Western Front and the Second World War preparations for D-Day. The DN&S; line has since closed, and the large Army and Royal Air Force ordnance depots have disappeared beneath the power station and Milton Park Business Park; however the 11 Explosive Ordnance Disposal and Search Regiment RLC is still based at the Vauxhall Barracks in the town. The Northbourne Centre in High Street, built in 1890 as St Peter's parish church Remains of the DN&S; railway survive in the eastern part of town. This line, designed to provide a direct link to the south coast from the Midlands and the North avoiding the indirect and congested route via Reading and Basingstoke, was built in 1879‚Äì82 after previous proposals had failed. It was designed as a main line and was engineered by John Fowler and built by contractors TH Falkiner and Sir Thomas Tancred, who together also constructed the Forth Railway Bridge. It was a very costly line to build due to the heavy engineering challenges of crossing the Berkshire and Hampshire Downs with a 1 in 106 gradient to allow for higher mainline speeds, and this initial cost and the initially lower than expected traffic volumes caused the company financial problems. It never independently reached Southampton, but instead joined the main London and South Western Railway line at Shawford, south of Winchester. First World War memorial, outside the new St Peter's church built in 1977 In the Second World War there was so much military traffic to the port of Southampton that the line was upgraded. The northern section between Didcot and Newbury was made double track. It was closed for 5 months in 1942‚Äì43 for this to be done. Several of the bridges in the area of Didcot and the Hagbournes were also strengthened and rebuilt. Although passenger trains between Didcot and were withdrawn in 1962, the line continued to be used by freight trains for a further four years, and there was regular oil traffic to the north from the refinery at Fawley near Southampton. But in 1966 this traffic also was withdrawn, and the line was then dismantled. The last passenger train was a re-routed Pines Express in May 1964, diverted due to a derailment at . A section of the abandoned embankment towards Upton, now designated as a Sustrans route, has views across the town and countryside. =21st century= As at 2011, Didcot had a population of more than 26,000. The new town centre, the Orchard Centre, was opened in August 2005. As part of the Science Vale Enterprise Zone, Didcot is surrounded by one of the largest scientific clusters in the United Kingdom. There are a number of major science and technology campuses nearby, including the Culham Science Centre, Harwell Science and Innovation Campus, and Milton Park. The Diamond Light Source synchrotron, based at the Harwell Campus, is the largest UK-funded scientific facility to be built for more than 30 years. Didcot has been designated as one of the three major growth areas in Oxfordshire; the Ladygrove development, to the north and east of the railway line on the former marshland, is set to double the number of homes in the town since construction began in the late 1980s. Originally, the Ladygrove development was planned to be complete by 2001, but the plans for the final section to the east of Abingdon Road were only announced in 2006. A Thames Travel bus on route 98 on Greenwood Way in the new Great Western Park estate Before the Ladygrove development was completed, a prolonged and contentious planning enquiry decided that a 3,200-home development would be built to the west of the town, partly overlapping the boundary with the Vale of White Horse. This is now being built as Great Western Park. In 2008 a new ¬£8 million arts and entertainment centre, Cornerstone, was opened in the Orchard Centre. It has exhibition and studio spaces, a caf√© and a 236-seat auditorium. Designed by Ellis William Architects, the centre is clad with silvered aluminium panels and has a window wall, used to connect the building with passing shoppers. The United Kingdom government named Didcot a garden town in 2015, the first existing town to gain this status, providing funding to support sustainable and environmentally friendly town development over the coming 15 years. Railways =Didcot Railway Centre= Formed by the Great Western Society in 1967 to house its collection of Great Western Railway locomotives and rolling stock, housed in Didcot's 1932-built Great Western engine shed. The Railway Centre is used as period film set and has featured in works including Anna Karenina, Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows and The Elephant Man. The centre is north of Didcot Parkway railway station, and can be accessed from the station via the pedestrian subway. =Didcot Parkway station= The station was originally called Didcot but then renamed in 1985 by British Rail; the site of the old GWR provender stores, which had been demolished in 1976 (the provender pond was kept to maintain the water table) was made into a large car park to attract passengers from the surrounding area. An improvement programme for the forecourt of the station began in September 2012. This was viewed as being the first phase of better connecting the station to Didcot town centre. Economy =Power stations= Aerial view of Didcot Power Stations A (centre) and B (extreme left) Didcot A Power Station (between Didcot and Sutton Courtenay) ceased generating electricity for the National Grid in March 2013. Country Life magazine once voted the power station the third worst eyesore in Britain. Didcot Power Stations viewed from Wittenham Clumps The power station cooling towers were visible from up to away because of their location, but were designed with visual impact in mind (six towers in two separated groups apart rather than a monolithic 3√ó2 block), much in the style of what is sometimes called Didcot's 'sister' station ‚Äì Fiddlers Ferry Power Station ‚Äì at Widnes, Cheshire, constructed slightly earlier. The power station had also proved a popular man-made object for local photographers. In October 2010, Didcot Sewage Works became the first in the UK to produce biomethane gas supplied to the national grid, for use in up to 200 homes in Oxfordshire. On Sunday 27 July 2014 three of the six cooling towers were demolished in the early hours of the morning, using of explosives. The demolition was streamed live by webcam. On Tuesday 23 February 2016, part of the boiler house building collapsed at Didcot Power Station; one person was declared dead, five injured and three missing. All were believed to have been preparing the site for demolition. On Sunday 17 July 2016, what remained of the structure was demolished in a controlled explosion. The bodies of the three missing men were still in the remains at that time. A spokesman said that because of the instability of the structure, it had not been possible to recover the three bodies. For safety reasons, robots were used to place the explosive charges, and the site was demolished just after 6 o'clock in the morning (BST). On Sunday 18 August 2019, the remaining three cooling towers were demolished at 7am. =Car racing= Didcot has a strong connection with the Williams Grand Prix Engineering team as Frank Williams founded the team there in a former carpet warehouse in 1977. page 29 After establishing themselves in Formula One, the factory, now including a small 'Williams Museum', moved within Didcot to a new factory on the Didcot A Power Station site on Basil Hill Road. They stayed there until 1995 when they finally outgrew the site, moving to nearby Grove where they are based today. In 2012 a new road through the new Great Western Park development in Didcot was named Sir Frank Williams Avenue in honour of Williams' contribution to the town. The Didcot-built Williams FW06 from 1978, being raced at Silverstone in 2007 Didcot also hosts a Pirelli distribution and logistics centre which provides tyres for Formula One Grand Prix motor racing events across Europe. Didcot's link to the automotive industry continued in 2015 when the head offices of the Bloodhound SSC team were moved to the new University Technical College (UTC) Oxfordshire site on the boundary between Didcot and Harwell. The team are aiming to break the world land speed record with their supersonic car. =Agriculture= Opium poppies were being cultivated at Harwell in June 2009 Didcot is surrounded by farmland which has historically grown traditional British crops such as wheat and barley, sheep farming is also common in the area. The area is also noted for farmers growing opium poppies for legal production of morphine and heroin to meet National Health Service demand. The poppies produced are sold to Macfarlan Smith, a major pharmaceutical company, who hold a licence from the United Kingdom Home Office. =Printing= From 2007 until 2017, the Daily Mail & General Trust had a printing plant in Didcot.Associated Newspapers to build new print plant Daily Mail & General Trust 27 June 2005Didcot closure costs to reach almost 50m PrintWeek 1 December 2016 Military The British Army's Vauxhall Barracks is on the edge of town. The regimental headquarters of 11 Explosive Ordnance Disposal and Search Regiment RLC is based in the town. Local government and representation Until 1974 Didcot was in Berkshire, but was transferred to Oxfordshire in that year, and from Wallingford Rural District to the district of South Oxfordshire, becoming the largest town in the new district. Didcot is also the largest town in the parliamentary constituency of Wantage, which has been represented since 2019 at Westminster by David Johnston, Conservative. Didcot is a parish but has the status of a town. It is administered by Didcot Town Council, which comprises 21 councillors representing the six wards in the town: *All Saints ‚Äì 5 members *Ladygrove ‚Äì 7 members *Milbrook ‚Äì 1 member *Northbourne ‚Äì 4 members *Orchard ‚Äì 1 member *Park ‚Äì 3 members Health The district in England with the highest healthy life expectancy, according to an Office for National Statistics (ONS) study, is the 1990s-built Ladygrove Estate in Didcot. While the average UK healthy lifespan was thought to be 68.8 for women and 67 for men in 2001, people in Ladygrove district of Didcot could expect 86 healthy years. It is believed Ladygrove may have benefited from the local recreation grounds and sports centre. Education Didcot is served by six primary schools: All Saints' C of E, Ladygrove Park, Manor, Northbourne C of E, Stephen Freeman and Willowcroft. Along with these 6 schools based in Didcot, a further 7 local village schools form the Didcot Primary Partnership: Blewbury Endowed C of E, Cholsey, Hagbourne, Harwell Community, Long Wittenham C of E and South Moreton County. There are two state-funded secondary schools in Didcot: St Birinus School and Didcot Girls' School are single-sex schools that join together at sixth form. Recently, another two secondary schools have opened; UTC, in 2015, and Aureus School, in 2017.  Arts and culture  Cornerstone, a new 278-seater multi-purpose arts centre, was opened on 29 August 2008. Didcot Choral Society, founded in 1958, performs three concerts a year in various venues around the town as well as an annual tour (Paris in 2008, Belgium in 2009). Didcot Concert Orchestra, founded in 2017, performs three concerts a year at Cornerstone. In November 2018, Rebellion Developments began setting up a new studio on the edge of Didcot, valued at $100 million, using the existing former Daily Mail printing works on Milton Road. The studio is planned to be used for film and TV series based on 2000 AD comic series characters, including Judge Dredd: Mega City One. Sport and leisure Didcot Town Football Club's Station Road Ground in 1982 Didcot Town Football Club's home ground is the Draycott Engineering Loop Meadow Stadium on the Ladygrove Estate, having moved from their previous pitch off Station Road in 1999 to make way for the new supermarket development. The club currently play in the 8th tier of the English Football League system. Most notable achievements include winning the FA Vase in 2005 and reaching The FA Cup 1st Round in 2015. Didcot has three main leisure centres: Didcot Leisure Centre, Didcot Wave Leisure Pool and Willowbrook Leisure Centre. Didcot has its own chapter of the Hash House Harriers. The club started in 1986 (the first run was on 8 April of that year). Didcot Cricket Club's current home ground is at Boundary Park in Great Western Park. Didcot Dragons Korfball club was founded in 2003. The club has two teams in the Oxfordshire leagues. They train in Willowbrook Leisure Centre in winter and Boundary Park in summer. Didcot Phoenix cycle club was founded in 1973 and is represented by over 70 members who participate in a range of cycling activities including touring, time trials, road racing, Audax, cyclocross and off-road events. The Didcot & District Table Tennis Association (DDTTA) was established in 1949 to promote the playing of table tennis in the Didcot area. It organises an annual league competition containing affiliated teams from towns and villages across south Oxfordshire. Didcot Runners is an AAA affiliated running club that meets every Tuesday & Thursday for group runs and fitness sessions at Didcot Town Football Club. Its members participate in running races across the country. The OVO Energy Women's Tour, a road cycling event, passed through Didcot on 12 June 2019. The race was halted for around 30 minutes on the Broadway because of a crash that caused the withdrawal of race leader Marianne Vos. =Parks, gardens and open spaces= Didcot Town Council maintains the following: * Edmonds Park * Loyd Recreation Park * Smallbone Recreation Park * Garden of Remembrance * Marsh Recreation Ground * Great Western Drive Park * Ladygrove Park and Lakes * Ladygrove woods * Ladygrove Skate Park * Mendip Heights Play Area * The Diamond Jubilee Garden * Broadway Gardens * Stubbings Land * Millennium wood at the Hagbourne Triangle * Cemetery, Kynaston Road Didcot also has a nature reserve, Mowbray Fields, where wildlife including common spotted orchid and Southern Marsh Orchid occur. Notable people Didcot was the birthplace of William Bradbery, the first person to cultivate watercress commercially in the early 19th century. Didcot is also the birthplace of former Reading and Oxford United manager Maurice Evans and one of Reading's most-capped football players Jerry Williams. Didcot-born rower Ken Lester competed in the 1960 Summer Olympics at the age of 13 in the coxed pairs (as the cox), he remains Britain's youngest ever male Olympian. Figurative artist Rodney Gladwell was also born in the town in 1928. Air Commodore Russell La Forte was born in Didcot in 1960 and was commander of British armed forces in the South Atlantic Islands between 2013 and 2015. He was a member of the Didcot Air Training Corps (Air Cadets) as a child. Matt Richardson, a comedian and television presenter known for hosting The Xtra Factor, grew up in Didcot. The band Radiohead are from nearby Abingdon and recorded many tracks from their discography in a converted apple shed on the edge of Didcot, near the power station site. This included a number of tracks from OK Computer that has appeared frequently in critic's lists of the greatest albums of all time. In popular culture Didcot's synonymous connection with railways was noted in Douglas Adams and John Lloyd's humorous book the Meaning of Liff, published in 1983. The book, a \\"dictionary of things that there aren't any words for yet\\", referred to \\"a Didcot\\" as \\"The small, oddly shaped bit of card which a ticket inspector cuts out of a ticket with his clipper for no apparent reason\\". Didcot is referred to in Ricky Gervais' comedy feature film David Brent: Life on the Road: the song \\"Lady Gypsy\\" on the film's soundtrack tells of a romantic meeting \\"by the lakeside, just south of Didcot\\". An electricity pylon on farmland alongside Abingdon Road (opposite Tamar Way) on the eastern edge of Didcot featured on the cover of US rock band Black Swan Lane's album Under My Fallen Sky, released in November 2017.

Life  Boolos is of Greek-Jewish descent.https://projecteuclid.org/download/pdf_1/euclid.rml/1204835733 He graduated with an A.B. in mathematics from Princeton University after completing a senior thesis, titled \\"A simple proof of G√∂del's first incompleteness theorem\\", under the supervision of Raymond Smullyan. Oxford University awarded him the B.Phil. in 1963. In 1966, he obtained the first PhD in philosophy ever awarded by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, under the direction of Hilary Putnam. After teaching three years at Columbia University, he returned to MIT in 1969, where he spent the rest of his career until his death from cancer.MIT faculty resolution on Boolos' death A charismatic speaker well known for his clarity and wit, he once delivered a lecture (1994b) giving an account of G√∂del's second incompleteness theorem, employing only words of one syllable. At the end of his viva, Hilary Putnam asked him, \\"And tell us, Mr. Boolos, what does the analytical hierarchy have to do with the real world?\\" Without hesitating Boolos replied, \\"It's part of it\\". An expert on puzzles of all kinds, in 1993 Boolos reached the London Regional Final of The Times crossword competition. His score was one of the highest ever recorded by an American. He wrote a paper on \\"The Hardest Logic Puzzle Ever\\"‚Äîone of many puzzles created by Raymond Smullyan.  Work  Boolos coauthored with Richard Jeffrey the first three editions of the classic university text on mathematical logic, Computability and Logic. The book is now in its fifth edition, the last two editions updated by John P. Burgess. Kurt G√∂del wrote the first paper on provability logic, which applies modal logic‚Äîthe logic of necessity and possibility‚Äîto the theory of mathematical proof, but G√∂del never developed the subject to any significant extent. Boolos was one of its earliest proponents and pioneers, and he produced the first book-length treatment of it, The Unprovability of Consistency, published in 1979. The solution of a major unsolved problem some years later led to a new treatment, The Logic of Provability, published in 1993. The modal-logical treatment of provability helped demonstrate the \\"intensionality\\" of G√∂del's Second Incompleteness Theorem, meaning that the theorem's correctness depends on the precise formulation of the provability predicate. These conditions were first identified by David Hilbert and Paul Bernays in their Grundlagen der Arithmetik. The unclear status of the Second Theorem was noted for several decades by logicians such as Georg Kreisel and Leon Henkin, who asked whether the formal sentence expressing \\"This sentence is provable\\" (as opposed to the G√∂del sentence, \\"This sentence is not provable\\") was provable and hence true. Martin L√∂b showed Henkin's conjecture to be true, as well as identifying an important \\"reflection\\" principle also neatly codified using the modal logical approach. Some of the key provability results involving the representation of provability predicates had been obtained earlier using very different methods by Solomon Feferman. Boolos was an authority on the 19th-century German mathematician and philosopher Gottlob Frege. Boolos proved a conjecture due to Crispin Wright (and also proved, independently, by others), that the system of Frege's Grundgesetze, long thought vitiated by Russell's paradox, could be freed of inconsistency by replacing one of its axioms, the notorious Basic Law V with Hume's Principle. The resulting system has since been the subject of intense work. Boolos argued that if one reads the second-order variables in monadic second-order logic plurally, then second-order logic can be interpreted as having no ontological commitment to entities other than those over which the first-order variables range. The result is plural quantification. David Lewis employed plural quantification in his Parts of Classes to derive a system in which Zermelo‚ÄìFraenkel set theory and the Peano axioms were all theorems. While Boolos is usually credited with plural quantification, Peter Simons (1982) has argued that the essential idea can be found in the work of Stanislaw Le≈õniewski. Shortly before his death, Boolos chose 30 of his papers to be published in a book. The result is perhaps his most highly regarded work, his posthumous Logic, Logic, and Logic. This book reprints much of Boolos's work on the rehabilitation of Frege, as well as a number of his papers on set theory, second-order logic and nonfirstorderizability, plural quantification, proof theory, and three short insightful papers on G√∂del's Incompleteness Theorem.

The unit was organized in 1942 and trained at Fort William Henry Harrison near Helena, Montana in the United States. The Force served in the Aleutian Islands, and fought in Italy, and southern France before being disbanded in December 1944. The modern American and Canadian special operations forces trace their heritage to this unit. In 2013, the United States Congress passed a bill to award the 1st Special Service Force the Congressional Gold Medal. History =Background= Geoffrey Pyke was an English journalist, educationalist, and later an inventor whose clever, but unorthodox, ideas could be difficult to implement. In lifestyle and appearance, he fit the common stereotype of a scientist-engineer-inventor or in British slang, a \\"boffin\\". This was part of the British approach in World War II, of encouraging innovative warfare methods and weapons, that was personally backed by Churchill. Hobart's Funnies are another example. While working for the British Combined Operations Command, Pyke devised a plan for the creation of a small, √©lite force capable of fighting behind enemy lines in winter conditions. This was to have been a commando unit that could be landed, by sea or air, into occupied Norway, Romania and/or the Italian Alps on sabotage missions against hydroelectric plants and oil fields. In Norway, the chief industrial threat was the creation of the heavy water used in the German atomic weapon research at Rjukan. Furthermore, attacks on Norwegian power stations, which supplied the country with 49% of its power, might drive the Axis powers out of the country and give the Allies a direct link to Russia. In Romania, there were the strategically important Ploie»ôti oil fields that met one quarter of the Germans' consumption, and Italian hydroelectric plants powered most of south German industry. Pyke requested that a tracked vehicle be developed especially for the unit, capable of carrying men and their equipment at high speed across snow-covered terrain. =Project Plough= In March 1942 Pyke proposed an idea, which he had named Project Plough, to Lord Louis Mountbatten, Chief of Combined Operations Headquarters (COHQ) that Allied commandos be parachuted into the Norwegian mountains to establish a covert base on the Jostedalsbreen, a large glacier plateau in German-occupied Norway, for guerrilla actions against the German army of occupation. Equipped with Pyke's proposed snow vehicle, they would attack strategic targets, such as hydroelectric power plants. Pyke persuaded Mountbatten that such a force would be virtually invulnerable in its glacier strongholds and would tie down large numbers of German troops trying to dislodge it. However, given the demands upon both Combined Operations and British industry, it was decided to offer it instead to the United States at the Chequers Conference of March 1942. General George Marshall, Chief of Staff of the United States Army, accepted the suggestion for Project Plough. In April 1942, since no suitable vehicle existed, the U.S. government asked automobile manufacturers to look into such a design. Studebaker subsequently created the T-15 cargo carrier, which later became the M29 Weasel. In May 1942, the concept papers for Plough were scrutinized by Major Robert T. Frederick, a young officer in the Operations Division of the U.S. General Staff. Frederick predicted Plough would be a military fiasco on the following grounds. Firstly, he argued that Plough endeavored to achieve unrealistic objectives with the number of troops that the plan called for. Similarly, he argued that the small, elite division would be outnumbered and overtaken in any defensive attempts to hold an area once it was captured. Furthermore, Frederick concluded that there was no concrete way to evacuate the troops after a mission. This would have required significant troop lift and covering fighter support. All vehicles and equipment would have had to be abandoned. Finally, the plan had called for troops to be parachute dropped by airplane to their targets, which Frederick said was impossible at the moment, as there were no planes to fly the men into Norway. Too, significant aircraft would be necessary to drop the Weasels and resupply the force. Ultimately, he concluded that a small squad of elite men would not do enough damage to justify the risk of putting them into battle and instead proposed a series of strategic bombings to achieve the plan's objectives. Generals Marshall and Eisenhower had already discussed Plough with the British High Command and were unwilling to compromise a chance to open an American front in Europe. It was believed that Plough offered the possibility of defeating the Germans, and the Americans wanted allied efforts to shift to the Pacific Theater. The sooner the Germans were defeated, it was argued, the sooner this would become a reality. The first officer picked to lead the unit, Lieutenant Colonel Howard R. Johnson, did not get along well with Pyke. Johnson was transferred after arguing with Mountbatten and Eisenhower about the feasibility of the plan. (Johnson went on to form and command the 501st Parachute Infantry Regiment.) He was replaced by Frederick, following a suggestion by Mountbatten, which was approved by Eisenhower. Frederick was given the task of creating a fighting unit for Project Plough and was promoted to colonel to command it. By July 1942 Frederick had eased Pyke out of the picture. The First Special Service Force was activated on 9 July 1942 as a joint Canadian-U.S. force of three small regiments and a service battalion, directly answerable to the joint Chiefs of Staff, U.S. Army. Fort William Henry Harrison in Helena, Montana, was chosen as the primary training location, due to its flat terrain for airborne training and its close proximity to mountains for ski and winter training. Frederick enjoyed a very high priority in obtaining equipment and training areas. Originally, due to its winter warfare mission, it had been intended that the unit should be equally made up of American, Canadian, and Norwegian troops. However, a lack of suitable Norwegians saw this changed to half American and half Canadian. = Canadian recruitment = In July 1942, the Canadian Minister of National Defence, James Ralston, approved the assignment of 697 officers and enlisted men for Project Plough, under the guise that they were forming Canada's first airborne unit, the 1st Canadian Parachute Battalion (1CPB). Due to a decision to raise an actual Canadian parachute battalion, the Canadian volunteers for Project Plough were also sometimes known unofficially as the \\"2nd Canadian Parachute Battalion\\". (The Canadians did not officially become a unit until April‚ÄìMay 1943, under the designation, 1st Canadian Special Service Battalion.) While its members remained part of the Canadian Army, subject to its code of discipline and paid by the Canadian government, they were to be supplied with uniforms, equipment, food, shelter and travel expenses by the U.S. Army. It was agreed that a Canadian would serve as second in command of the force and that half of the officers and one third of the enlisted men would be Canadian. After Lieutenant Colonel McQueen, the senior Canadian member broke his leg during parachute training, the highest ranking Canadian in the force was Lieutenant Colonel Don Williamson, who commanded the 2nd Regiment. = U.S. recruitment = The U.S. volunteers for the force consisted initially of officers from Forts Belvoir and Benning. Letters of recruitment were posted to all U.S. Army units in the Southwest and on the Pacific coast. The letters called for single men, aged 21‚Äì35 with three or more years of grammar school. Occupations preferred: Rangers, lumberjacks, northwoodsmen, hunters, prospectors, explorers and game wardens. Inspection teams also scoured the western camps for ideal candidates. Those chosen, owing to the secrecy of the mission, were often told that they had been selected to undergo training for a parachute unit. Indeed, the unit was so secretive, that many soldiers did not know where they were when they arrived in Helena for training, as the windows of the trains carrying the troops were painted black. The combat force was to be made up of three regiments. Each regiment was led by a lieutenant colonel and 32 officers and boasted a force of 385 men. The regiments were divided into two battalions with three companies in each battalion and three platoons in each company. The platoon was then broken up into two sections. Following initial training period in Montana, the FSSF relocated to Camp Bradford, Virginia, on 15 April 1943, and to Fort Ethan Allen, Vermont, on 23 May 1943. =Aleutian Islands, 1943= It was decided that the FSSF would be utilized against Japanese forces occupying islands off Alaska. The FSSF arrived at the San Francisco Port of Embarkation on 4 July 1943.Stanton, Shelby, World War II Order of Battle: An Encyclopedic Reference to U.S. Army Ground Forces from Battalion through Division, 1939-1946 (Revised Edition, 2006), Stackpole Books, p. 191 On 10 July the Devil's Brigade sailed for the Aleutian Islands off Alaska. On 15 August 1943, 1st SSF was part of the invasion force of the island of Kiska, but after discovering the island was recently evacuated by Japanese forces, it re-embarked and left ship at Camp Stoneman, California, and returned to Fort Ethan Allen, arriving 9 September 1943. =Italy, 1943= In late 1943, the original Project Plough (with its target as Norway) was abandoned,See: Geoffrey Pyke#Military inventions but in October 1943, the commander of the United States Fifth Army, Lieutenant General Mark W. Clark, brought the 1st Special Service Force to Italy where its members demonstrated the value of their unique skills and training. The Devil's Brigade arrived in Casablanca in French Morocco in November 1943 and quickly moved to the Italian front arriving at Naples on 19 November 1943 and immediately going into the line with the U.S. 36th Infantry Division. The force was tasked with taking two heavily fortified German positions in the Italian mountains; one at Monte La Difensa and the other at Monte La Remetanea. These positions were controlled by the 104th Panzer Grenadier Regiment with the Herman Goering Panzer Division in reserve (the former an infantry formation, and the latter an armored division). The importance of these mountains lay in their position relative to Hitler's Gustav Line. That is, the German Winter line positioned on La Difensa and Remetanea were the last entrenched line before the Gustav and an allied push through the mountains would enable them to advance closer to Rome. Strategically, the mountains provided a commanding view of the countryside and highway, giving German artillery on the mountain control of the surrounding area. The German artillery atop La Defensa were also using a new weapon - the Nebelwerfer. The paths leading up La Difensa were heavily scouted by the force prior to their attack and it was reported to Lt. Col. T.C. MacWilliam (who would lead the 2nd regiment's assault on Remetanea) that the best way to approach the entrenched enemy was up an almost vertical escarpment over the right of the hill mass. In doing this, the force hoped to catch the Germans off guard, as previous allied attacks on the mountain had met the enemy head on. The assault was planned for 2 December, while the men were trained in mountain climbing and fighting tactics at their temporary barracks at Santa Maria. The plan was as follows (all regiments were in the 1st Company): At 16:30 hours on December 1, 2nd Regiment would be trucked to within of the base of the mountain and march the rest of the way to La Difensa (6-hour march). 1st Regiment, coupled with U.S. 36th Infantry Division would be the reserve units for the 2nd Regiment. 3rd Regiment would be split in two, half to supply the 2nd Regiment following the initial assault and the other half to be reserves with the 1st Regiment and 36th Infantry Division. All identification on Force soldiers was to be removed except their dog tags. After reaching the base of the mountain and having had a single night's rest, 2nd Regiment (600 men total) began their ascent of La Difensa on 2 December at dusk under cover of a heavy artillery barrage. One soldier recalls the severity of the shelling: \\"It looked as if we were marching into Hell. The whole mountain was being shelled and the whole mountain seemed to be on fire\\". The soldiers of the 2nd Regiment came within range of the German positions at midnight and began to climb the final cliff, which jutted steeply upwards for . The men climbed with ropes tied to one another in the freezing rain. Upon reaching the top, MacWilliam signaled his men to move forward into a depression in front of the German entrenchment. Initially, the soldiers were given the order to hold their fire until 6am, but the Germans were made aware of the allied positions after members of the force tripped over loose gravel while moving along the mountaintop. German shot flares into the air and the battle began. Through gun and mortar fire, the men of the 2nd Regiment managed to set up machine guns and return fire, surprising and overwhelming the Germans. The 5th Army Staff had guessed that the battle would last between 4‚Äì5 days, but within two hours, the Germans on La Difensa had retreated to La Remetanea. Previously, American and British forces had suffered many casualties in futile attempts to take the important Camino Ridge. The 1st SSF was successful in taking their initial objective of La Defensa but were delayed in obtaining their actual objective of Monte La Remetanea (Hill 907). The attack on 907 was halted after the death of the 1st Battalion CO Lt. Col. T.C. MacWilliam. While he desired that the force momentum continue, Frederick ordered a halt in the advance on 907 in order to wait for reinforcements and supplies. The force dug in at Difensa, anticipating a German counterattack. However, massive allied artillery barrages and the flooding of both the Rapido and Garigliano rivers prevented the Germans from reforming. While waiting for the orders to attack Remetanea, the 2nd Regiment were resupplied by the 1st and 3rd Regiments, who brought them whiskey and condoms (to keep the barrels of their guns dry in the rain). Once the British forces broke through the German lines at Monte Camino, the force was ordered to attack their primary objective (Hill 907). The successful assault on Difensa was the basis for the 1968 motion picture titled The Devil's Brigade. The 1st SSF immediately continued its attack, assaulting Monte La Remetanea from 6 to 9 December. It captured Hill 720, starting from Monte Sammucro on 25 December, and after difficulties assaulted Monte Majo and Monte Vischiataro almost simultaneously on 8 January 1944. During the mountain campaign the 1st SSF suffered 77% casualties: 511 total, 91 dead, 9 missing, 313 wounded with 116 exhaustion cases. They were relieved by the 142nd Infantry. =Anzio, 1944= Personnel being briefed before setting out on a patrol at the Anzio beachhead Following the Qu√©bec Conference in August 1943, General Dwight D. Eisenhower was moved to London to plan for the Normandy landings. Command of the Mediterranean Theater was given to British General Henry Maitland Wilson. General Sir Harold Alexander, commanding the Allied Armies in Italy, had formulated the plan to land Allied troops at Anzio in order to outflank German positions in the area. German Field Marshal Albert Kesselring commanded the four German divisions at Anzio, which included the Hermann Goering Division and the 35th Panzer Grenadier Regiment of the 16th SS Panzergrenadier Division Reichsf√ºhrer-SS Division. Combined German and Italian strength at Anzio was an estimated 70,000 men. The Special Force brigade was withdrawn from the mountains in January and on 1 February was landed at the beachhead created by Operation Shingle at Anzio, south of Rome, replacing the 1st and 3rd Ranger Battalions, which had suffered heavy losses at the Battle of Cisterna. Their task was to hold and raid from the right-hand flank of the beachhead marked by the Mussolini Canal/Pontine Marshes. 1st Regiment was positioned on the force's right front, which comprised one-third of the entire line, while the 3rd Regiment guarded the remaining two-thirds of the line. 2nd Regiment, which had been reduced to three companies following the attacks on La Difensa, Sammucio and Majo, were tasked with running night patrols into Axis territory. Shortly after the SSF took over the Mussolini Canal sector, German units pulled back up to to avoid their aggressive patrols. The force's constant night raids forced Kesselring to fortify the German positions in their area with more men than he had originally planned. Reconnaissance missions performed by the Devil's often went as deep as behind enemy lines. Frederick was greatly admired by the soldiers of the First Special Service Force for his willingness to fight alongside the men in battle. On the beachhead in Anzio, for example, a nighttime Force patrol walked into a German minefield and was pinned down by machine gun fire. Colonel Frederick ran into battle and assisted the litter bearers in clearing the wounded Force members. German prisoners were often surprised at how few men the force actually contained. A captured German lieutenant admitted to being under the assumption that the force was a division. Indeed, General Frederick ordered several trucks to move around the forces area in order to give the enemy the impression that the force comprised more men than it actually did. An order was found on another prisoner that stated that the Germans in Anzio would be \\"fighting an elite Canadian-American Force. They are treacherous, unmerciful and clever. You cannot afford to relax. The first soldier or group of soldiers capturing one of these men will be given a 10-day furlough.\\" It was at Anzio that the Germans dubbed the 1st Special Service Force the \\"Black Devils.\\" There is no record of any German ever referring to the Force as \\"The Devil's Brigade\\". They were referred to as \\"black\\" devils because the brigade's members smeared their faces with black boot polish for their covert operations in the dark of the night. During Anzio, the 1st SSF fought for 99 days without relief. It was also at Anzio that the 1st SSF used their trademark stickers; during night patrols soldiers would carry stickers depicting the unit patch and a slogan written in German: \\"Das dicke Ende kommt noch,\\" said to translate colloquially to \\"The worst is yet to come\\". Its literal translation is actually \\"The thick end is coming soon\\", implying that a larger force was on its way imminently, placing these stickers on German corpses and fortifications. Canadian and American members of the Special Force who lost their lives are buried near the beach in the Commonwealth Anzio War Cemetery and the American Cemetery in Nettuno, just east of Anzio. When the U.S. Fifth Army's breakout offensive began on 25 May 1944, the 1st SSF was sent against Monte Arrestino, and attacked Rocca Massima on 27 May. The 1st SSF was given the assignment of capturing seven bridges in the city to prevent their demolition by the withdrawing Wehrmacht. During the night of 4 June, members of the 1st SSF entered Rome, one of the first Allied units to do so. After they secured the bridges, they quickly moved north in pursuit of the retreating Germans. In August 1944 1st SSF came under the command of Colonel Edwin Walker when Brigadier General Frederick, who had commanded the force since its earliest days, left on promotion to major general to command the 1st Airborne Task Force. =France, 1944= On 14 August 1944, the 1st SSF landed on the islands of Port Cros and √éle du Levant during Operation Dragoon, the invasion of southern France. They fought the small Battle of Port Cros in which they captured the five forts on the islands from the German Army. Nine men were killed in action or died of wounds received in combat. On 22 August it was attached to the 1st Airborne Task Force, a provisional Seventh Army airborne division, and later made part of the Task Force. On 7 September it moved with the 1st Airborne Task Force to defensive positions on the Franco- Italian border. During the war the 1,800-man unit accounted for some 12,000 German casualties, captured some 7,000 prisoners, and sustained an attrition rate of over 600%. =Disbandment, 1944= The 1st SSF was disbanded 5 December 1944 in a field near [Villeneuve-Loubet], on the extreme southeast Mediterranean coast of France. Villeneuve-Loubet holds a special place in the history of the force, not only because the unit was broken up there, but also because it is one of the villages that the 1st SSF had the hardest time capturing in southern France, on 26 August 1944. The day the unit was disbanded, the American commander held a parade honouring the unit. To end the ceremony, the Canadian elements were dismissed by being honoured by the American troops with a Pass in Review, eyes right, officers salute. After the unit's break up, the Canadians were sent to other Canadian units (most of them became replacements for the 1st Canadian Parachute Battalion). Some American members were sent to airborne divisions as replacements, others to Ranger Battalions, and still others formed the 474th Infantry Regiment, which served with the Third United States Army and performed occupation duty in Norway. United States Army Special Forces Groups (lineal descendants of 1st Special Service Force) celebrate Menton Day every 5 December with their Canadian military comrades and surviving members of the force. Usually there is a combined parachute jump, a pass in review, and a formal ball.  Training and equipment  Since the unit needed to be trained quickly, the soldiers began parachuting within 48 hours of their arrival in Helena, Montana. The camp had no training towers and preliminary flights were not carried out, so for many this was their first experience at jumping. This training was completed before any other because it was believed that if all the soldiers earned their jumping badges simultaneously a sense of camaraderie would develop within the camp. The men were on a strict and physically demanding three phase training schedule: 1) From August to October: parachuting, weapons and demolitions usage, small unit tactics and physical training. 2) From October to November: unit tactics and problem solving. 3) From November to July: skiing, rock climbing, adaptation to cold climates and operation of the M29 Weasel. The weekly training schedule comprised reveille at 04:30 from Monday to Saturday followed by breakfast at 06:30. The obstacle course was run by 08:00 four times a week followed by the day's training, which differed depending on the month. Soldiers were expected to march double time between training exercises in order to adhere to the strict schedule. Training lectures were given by veterans of overseas wars in the evenings from Monday to Friday. Soldiers were given Saturday evenings and Sundays off. Most of the men went into Helena to relax on their days off. Marches were done on a course, the record for which was held by Colonel Marshall's First Regiment, who completed it in twenty hours. The force trained with enemy weapons, taking them apart, reassembling and shooting them until they were as proficient with them as with their own. The hand-to-hand combat instructor was Dermot (Pat) O'Neill, an ex-Shanghai International Police Officer, who was an expert at unarmed combat. O'Neill, who was well-versed in several forms of martial arts, taught the men to attack the eyes, throat, groin and knees. He also taught knife fighting tactics and showed the men how to quick-draw their pistols. The men attacked one another with unsheathed bayonets as part of the training exercises and injuries were common. Ski training, taught by Norwegian instructors, began in December. The men received lectures and demonstrations on skiing techniques and most had mastered the basics in two weeks. At this point the men were made to ski cross-country in formation from dawn until dusk with all of their equipment until they were up to Norwegian army standards. As a light infantry unit destined for alpine or winter combat it was issued various items of non- standard clothing, equipment and rations, including skis, parkas, haversacks and the Mountain ration. From the outset, the 1st Special Service Force was armed with a variety of non-standard or limited-issue weapons, such as the M1941 Johnson machine gun. The Johnson light machine gun in particular helped greatly increase the firepower of the unit and was highly regarded by those who used it in combat. Frederick's staff even considered arming the men with blow darts but it was decided against on the grounds that it may have been considered a war crime. Frederick himself participated in the design of a fighting knife made exclusively for the force called the V-42 combat knife, a derivative of the Fairbairn-Sykes fighting knife. Name, insignia and uniforms While carrying out beachhead operations at Anzio, legend has it that a member of the force uncovered the journal of a German lieutenant from the Hermann Goering Division. The journal contained the following entry: \\"The Black Devils are all around us every time we come into the line. We never hear them come.\\" This legend was never verified as fact by any member of the brigade; however, the force was known as the Black Devils and as the Devil's Brigade. The members of the brigade preferred the latter. General Frederick had cards printed up with the unit's insignia on them and the words or \\"The worst is yet to come\\" printed in red ink down the right side which the force would leave on the bodies of dead Germans as a form of psychological warfare. This was so effective that Sergeant Victor Kaisner reported hearing a German soldier whisper (\\"Black Devil\\") as the German's throat was being sliced on the beachhead. However, recent historiography surrounding the unit debates whether or not Frederick and his general staff made up the nickname in order to instill fear in the enemy. The unit was unofficially first known as the \\"Braves\\". Their spearhead shoulder insignia was chosen with this name in mind. The formation patch was a red spearhead with the words USA written horizontally and CANADA written vertically. The branch of service insignia was the crossed arrows formerly worn by the U.S. Army Indian Scouts. The unit wore red, white, and blue piping on their garrison cap and on the breast an oval (or trimming) behind their Parachutist Wings. Members of the unit also wore a red, white, and blue fourrag√®re, lanyard, or shoulder cord made out of parachute shroud lines. American members of the force arrived for training in Helena in standard U.S. Army attire: green twill coveralls, some wearing khaki pants and fatigue hats. Others were dressed in trousers and green uniform jackets and wore green caps. Ultimately, however, the American uniforms did not differ widely from one another. The Canadian troops, however, arrived in all different manners of uniform: some wore kilts, others tartan trousers (trews) and others Bermuda shorts. Headgear differed just as widely, depending on where the soldier was from ‚Äì wedge caps for some, black berets for troops taken from armoured regiments and large khaki Tam o' Shanters for soldiers from Scottish regiments. Under the Williamson-Wickham agreement, Canadian soldiers were issued and wore American uniforms. Eventually, it was decided that the uniforms would come from an American supplier and olive drab trousers and blouses were issued. The two uniform elements differentiated an American Force member from a Canadian: 1) the collar insignia had either U.S. or Canada above the crossed arrows; and two, the identification disc, aka \\"dog tags,\\" worn by the soldier (Americans wore American metal ID tags and Canadians wore Canadian ID discs). Frederick instructed MAJ Orville Baldwin to develop a unique fourrag√®re (also known as an aiguillette or lanyard) for all members of the unit, thereby replacing the regimental fourrag√®re worn by the Canadian soldiers. The result was a braided fourrag√®re made with red, white and blue parachute cord. For mountain warfare, the men were given baggy ski pants, parkas and a helmet. Standard boots were originally the same as those issued to parachuting regiments, but these were substituted with infantry combat boots in Italy. Colonel Frederick worried from the outset that the soldiers from both countries would have trouble forming a cohesive unit. On a base level, the techniques and commands used by either army were confusing to the other. Commands for marching, for example, had to be homogenized in order for the unit to operate in the field effectively. In order to satisfy the men from both countries, compromises were made. Canadian bagpipers were put into American unit marching bands to play \\"Reveille\\" every morning. The marching styles and commands of the American and Canadian armies were mixed and uniforms were made identical. In the end, Frederick's fears were unfounded as the men bonded through training and dedication to the force. Unit awards, legacy and memorials = Unit awards = The First Special Service Force was awarded the French Croix de Guerre with Silver-Gilt Star, as well as the Distinguished Unit Citation for extraordinary heroism. A large number of the \\"Devil's Brigade\\" members were honored for their acts of valor, including Tommy Prince, Canada's most decorated First Nations soldier of World War II. Also, U.S. member Wendell C. Johnson (Fifth Company, Third Regiment, serial # 37 168 437), risking his life to save a fellow Black Devil, walked into a minefield and brought his brigade comrade to safety. When they tried to give him a medal for his act of heroism, Wendell declined saying, \\"Give it to the man who lost his leg\\". = Descendant units = The 1st Special Service Force is claimed as a direct ancestor by two modern special operations units; the Canadian Special Operations Regiment (CSOR) of the Canadian Special Operations Forces Command and the elite unit of the 1st Special Forces Command (Airborne) of the United States Army Special Operations Command. In 1952, Colonel Aaron Bank (a former Jedburgh and Operational Group member of the Office of Strategic Services [OSS] during WW II) became the commander of 10th Special Forces Group (Airborne). Formal lineage for the 1st Special Forces Regiment (Not to be confused with the 1st Special Forces Group (Airborne)), established in 1958, was from the FSSF. (Special Forces carried the Ranger lineage from 1952-58.) Much of the training in unconventional tactics, including strategies, and lessons learned, replicated training of the Operation Groups (OG) and Jedburghs of the OSS. In Canada Military Intelligence and Logistical Operations 1952‚Äì1988, the Canadian Airborne Regiment 1968‚Äì1995 which formed part of the Special Service Force 1977-1995 and today's Canadian Special Operations Regiment, like United States Army Special Forces, trace their roots to the FSSF. Just like in World War II, Canada's elite JTF2 and the United States' elite SFOD-D operators were united once again into a special assignment force for the 2001 invasion of Afghanistan. Great Falls. As part of the brigade's 65th anniversary celebration, a Canadian special forces soldier arrives at Fort Lewis. In 2006, the Canadian members of the 1st Special Service Force received the United States Army's Combat Infantryman Badge for participation in front-line combat. On 3 February 2015, the FSSF was awarded the Congressional Gold Medal, the highest award congress can give to civilians. = Other memorials = In 1996, Interstate 15 in Montana between Helena and Sweet Grass was renamed the \\"First Special Service Force Memorial Highway\\". This highway was chosen because it was the route taken in 1942 by the Canadian volunteers to join their American counterparts for training at Fort Harrison. The entire length of Alberta Highway 4 received the same name in 1999. The force is also memorialized in several commemorative plaques mounted in city halls and along the route they fought in Italy and Southern France, including one outside the Protestant Cemetery, Rome, next to the Pyramid of Cestius and another on the Embassy of the United States in Rome, facing Via Vittorio Veneto. = U.S. Army Special Forces Tab = When the Special Forces Tab was created in 1983 for wear by members of the U.S. Army Special Forces, it was also retroactively awarded to members of wartime combat units that had been identified as predecessors of the Special Forces. Thus, any soldier who had spent 120 days in wartime service with the First Special Service Force is authorized to wear the Special Forces Tab. Media depictions The Devil's Brigade is a 1968 film starring William Holden, Cliff Robertson, and Vince Edwards, focusing on the force's training and deployment to Italy. The 1968 film Anzio featured Peter Falk as Corporal Jack Rabinoff, who identified himself to co-star Robert Mitchum as a member of the American- Canadian 1st Special Service Force. Three documentaries have been made about the force: \\"Black Devils\\" in 2000, an episode of History Channel's \\"Dangerous Missions\\" series, written produced and directed by Darryl Rehr; Daring to Die: The Story of the Black Devils, written and directed by Greg Hancock and Wayne Abbot, and Devil's Brigade, a 2006 TV miniseries produced by Frantic Films. Quentin Tarantino's 2009 film Inglourious Basterds features a character named Lt. Aldo Raine aka \\"Aldo the Apache\\" played by Brad Pitt who wears the unit's crossed arrows collar insignia and red arrowhead shoulder patch. Tarantino cited the 1SSF as an influence. The Devil's Brigade by Robert H. Adleman & George H. Walton is an autobiography and historical reference for the First Special Service Force. The Marvel Comics character Wolverine claimed several times he was a member of Devil's Brigade during the war; being him Canadian- born during last years of Queen Victoria's reign, it fits; he also claimed he took part in Anzio and Cassino battles.

Often, the domain and/or codomain will have additional structure which is inherited by the function space. For example, the set of functions from any set into a vector space has a natural vector space structure given by pointwise addition and scalar multiplication. In other scenarios, the function space might inherit a topological or metric structure, hence the name function space. In linear algebra Addition of functions: The sum of the sine and the exponential function is \\\\sin+\\\\exp:\\\\R\\\\to\\\\R with (\\\\sin+\\\\exp)(x)=\\\\sin(x)+\\\\exp(x) Let be a vector space over a field and let be any set. The functions ‚Üí can be given the structure of a vector space over where the operations are defined pointwise, that is, for any , : ‚Üí , any in , and any in , define : \\\\begin{align} (f+g)(x) &= f(x)+g(x) \\\\\\\\\\\\ (c\\\\cdot f)(x) &= c\\\\cdot f(x) \\\\end{align} When the domain has additional structure, one might consider instead the subset (or subspace) of all such functions which respect that structure. For example, if is also a vector space over , the set of linear maps ‚Üí form a vector space over with pointwise operations (often denoted Hom(,)). One such space is the dual space of : the set of linear functionals ‚Üí with addition and scalar multiplication defined pointwise. Examples Function spaces appear in various areas of mathematics: * In set theory, the set of functions from X to Y may be denoted X ‚Üí Y or YX. ** As a special case, the power set of a set X may be identified with the set of all functions from X to {0, 1}, denoted 2X. * The set of bijections from X to Y is denoted X \\\\leftrightarrow Y. The factorial notation X! may be used for permutations of a single set X. * In functional analysis the same is seen for continuous linear transformations, including topologies on the vector spaces in the above, and many of the major examples are function spaces carrying a topology; the best known examples include Hilbert spaces and Banach spaces. * In functional analysis the set of all functions from the natural numbers to some set X is called a sequence space. It consists of the set of all possible sequences of elements of X. * In topology, one may attempt to put a topology on the space of continuous functions from a topological space X to another one Y, with utility depending on the nature of the spaces. A commonly used example is the compact-open topology, e.g. loop space. Also available is the product topology on the space of set theoretic functions (i.e. not necessarily continuous functions) YX. In this context, this topology is also referred to as the topology of pointwise convergence. * In algebraic topology, the study of homotopy theory is essentially that of discrete invariants of function spaces; * In the theory of stochastic processes, the basic technical problem is how to construct a probability measure on a function space of paths of the process (functions of time); * In category theory the function space is called an exponential object or map object. It appears in one way as the representation canonical bifunctor; but as (single) functor, of type [X, -], it appears as an adjoint functor to a functor of type (-√óX) on objects; * In functional programming and lambda calculus, function types are used to express the idea of higher-order functions. * In domain theory, the basic idea is to find constructions from partial orders that can model lambda calculus, by creating a well-behaved cartesian closed category. * In the representation theory of finite groups, given two finite-dimensional representations and of a group , one can form a representation of over the vector space of linear maps Hom(,) called the Hom representation. Functional analysis Functional analysis is organized around adequate techniques to bring function spaces as topological vector spaces within reach of the ideas that would apply to normed spaces of finite dimension.

The harbour's deep, sheltered waters and strategic location on the South China Sea were instrumental in Hong Kong's establishment as a British colony and its subsequent development as a trading centre. Throughout its history, the harbour has seen numerous reclamation projects undertaken on both shores, many of which have caused controversy in recent years. Environmental concerns have been expressed about the effects of these expansions, in terms of water quality and loss of natural habitat. It has also been proposed that benefits of land reclamation may be less than the effects of decreased harbour width, affecting the number of vessels passing through the harbour. Nonetheless Victoria Harbour still retains its founding role as a port for thousands of international vessels each year. View of Victoria Harbour from a hill, 1845 The harbour is a major tourist attraction of Hong Kong. Lying in the middle of the territory's dense urban region, the harbour is the site of annual fireworks displays and its promenades are used as gathering places for tourists and residents. History Victoria Harbour and Hong Kong Island in the 1860s HMS Tamar anchored off the naval dockyard in Victoria Harbour in 1905 View from the Sky100 The first reference to what is now called Victoria Harbour is found in Zheng He's sailing maps of the China coast, dated c.1425, which appear in the Wubei Zhi (A Treatise on Armament Technology), a comprehensive 17th-century military book. While the harbour was charted in later maps, the first map depicting it in detail is an 1810 marine chartMarine Chart prepared for the East India Company by Captain Daniel Ross and Lieutenant Philip Maughan of the Bombay Marine. prepared for the East India Company by Daniel Ross and Philip Maughan, lieutenants of the Bombay Marine.Agreement No. CE 42/2005 (WS). Marine Archaeological Investigation , January 2007, pp.7-8 Some of the first recreational activities to take place in the harbour were water competitions such as swimming and water polo in the 1850s, undertaken by members of Hong Kong's first sports club, the Victoria Recreation Club.Lam, S. F. Chang W, Julian. [2006] (2006) The Quest for Gold: Fifty Years of Amateur Sports in Hong Kong, 1947‚Äì1997. Hong Kong University Publishing. . During the Taiping Rebellion, armed rebels paraded the streets of Hong Kong. On 21 December 1854, the Hong Kong police arrested several armed rebels who were about to attack Kowloon City. On 23 January 1855, a fleet of Taiping war boats was on the verge of a naval battle against Chinese imperial war boats defending the harbour. The Chinese defenders were ordered away by the British colonial authorities. These incidents caused rising tension that would eventually lead to the Arrow War.Tsai, Jung-fang (1995). Hong Kong in Chinese History: community and social unrest in the British Colony, 1842‚Äì1913. The harbour was originally called \\"Hong Kong Harbour\\", but was later renamed to \\"Victoria Harbour\\", to assure shelter for the British fleet under Queen Victoria.Macdonald. Gina. [1996] (1996). James Clavell: A Critical Companion. Greenwood Press. . The subject of pollution came to the fore in the 1970s with the rapid growth of the manufacturing sector. The water club races were stopped in 1973 due to pollution in the harbour, a year after the former RMS Queen Elizabeth burned and sank at the Tsing Yi island anchorage. Studies also showed excessive nitrogen input from discharges of the Pearl River Delta into the harbour for decades.Wolanski, Eric. [2006] (2006). The Environment in Asia Pacific Harbors. Springer Publishing. . After completion of the Central and Wan Chai Reclamation Feasibility Study in 1989, the Land Development Policy Committee endorsed a concept for gradual implementation of this additional reclamation. It consists of three district development cells separated by parks, namely, Central, Tamar and Exhibition. The latest proposed reclamation, extending along the waterfront from Sheung Wan to Causeway Bay, faced public opposition, as the harbour has become a pivotal location to Hongkongers in general. Activists have denounced the government's actions as destructive not only to the natural environment, but also to what is widely considered as one of the most prized natural assets of the territory. NGOs, including the Society for Protection of the Harbour, were formed to resist further attempts to reduce the size of the waterbody, with its chairman, Christine Loh, quoted as saying that the harbour \\"...is a precious national asset and we must preserve it for future generations. I believe an insightful and visionary chief executive would support our stance and work with us to protect the harbour\\".Harbourprotection. \\"Harbourprotection .\\" Love Harbour Day. Retrieved on 11 April 2007. Reclamation work also led to the demolition of Queen's Pier and Edinburgh Place Ferry Pier, structures of historic significance, to massive public opposition. Geography Satellite view of Victoria Harbour in the 2000s Central Plaza, with the shores of Hong Kong Island at the left and Kowloon at the right. Victoria Harbour covered an area of about in 2004. The eastern boundary is generally considered to be the line formed between the westernmost extremity of Siu Chau Wan (Â∞èÈÖíÁÅ£) and A Kung Ngam. The western boundary is generally considered to consist of a line drawn from the westernmost point of Hong Kong Island to the westernmost point of Green Island, thence a straight line drawn from the westernmost point of Green Island to the southeasternmost point of Tsing Yi, thence along the eastern and northern coastal lines of Tsing Yi to its westernmost extremity, and thence a straight line drawn true north towards the mainland.Interpretation and General Clauses Ordinance (Cap 1), Laws of Hong Kong. Schedule 3: Boundaries of the Harbour There are several islands within the harbour: *Green Island *Little Green Island *Kowloon Rock *Tsing Yi Island Due to land reclamation, the following are former islands that are now connected to adjacent lands or larger islands: *Stonecutters Island (connected to Lai Chi Kok Bay, New Kowloon) *Channel Rock (connected to Kwun Tong, New Kowloon) *Kellett Island (connected to Causeway Bay, Hong Kong Island) *Hoi Sham Island (connected to To Kwa Wan, Kowloon) *Nga Ying Chau (connected to Tsing Yi Island, New Territories) *Pillar Island (connected to Kwai Chung, New Territories) *Mong Chau (connected to Kwai Chung, New Territories) *Chau Tsai (connected to Tsing Yi Island) *Rumsey Rock (within Tsim Sha Tsui/Hung Hom) Tourism Hong Kong's old airport, Kai Tak, was located in Victoria Harbour. Victoria Harbour is known for its panoramic night view and skyline, particularly in the direction towards Hong Kong Island where the skyline of skyscrapers is superimposed over the ridges behind. Among the best places to view the harbour are the Peak Tower atop Victoria Peak, or from the piazza at the Cultural Centre or the promenade of Tsim Sha Tsui on the Kowloon side. Rides on the Star Ferry, including the route between Central and Tsim Sha Tsui, are another way to view the harbour and cityscape. As the natural centre of the territory, the harbour has played host to many major public shows, including the annual fireworks displays on the second night of the Lunar New Year. These shows are popular with tourists and locals alike, and the display is usually telecast on local television. To enhance the popularity of the harbour as a sightseeing location, the government introduced a show dubbed A Symphony of Lights. Also recently opened was the Avenue of Stars, built along the promenade outside the New World Centre in Tsim Sha Tsui. Modeled on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, it honours the most illustrious people the Hong Kong film industry has produced over the past decades. By the end of November every year, the outer walls of buildings in the central business districts on both sides of the harbours are dressed with Christmas-related decorations, and replaced with Lunar New Year- related ones by January. Port facilities Hong Kong Ocean Terminal in December 2008 Victoria Harbour is home to most of the port facilities of Hong Kong, making Hong Kong amongst the world's busiest. An average of 220,000 ships visit the harbour each year, including both oceangoing vessels and river vessels, for both goods and passengers. The Kwai Chung Container Terminals in the western part of the harbour is the main container handling facility, operating round the clock. Some 19.8 million containers (measured in TEUs) were handled by the region in 2016. Some 400 container ships serve Hong Kong weekly, connecting to over 500 destinations around the world. For many years until 2004, Hong Kong handled the most containers TEUs but slipped to sixth place on declining volumes by 2016. Transport Meridian Star of the Star Ferry crossing Victoria Harbour The ocean liner RMS Queen Elizabeth caught fire and capsized in Victoria Harbour in 1972. There is no bridge crossing the harbour, but there are three cross-harbour road tunnels: Cross Harbour Tunnel (opened 1972), Eastern Harbour Crossing (1989), and Western Harbour Crossing (1997). The three tunnels act as important linkages between the Hong Kong Island and Kowloon. Three Mass Transit Railway routes also run under the Harbour. They are namely: *Tsuen Wan Line *Tseung Kwan O Line (sharing an immersed tube with the Eastern Harbour Crossing) *Tung Chung Line and Airport Express, which share the same trackage within the tunnel A fourth railway route will soon also pass under the harbour as part of the East Rail Line, connecting Hung Hom to Exhibition and Admiralty stations. The Star Ferry has been crossing the harbour since the late 19th century. The operated ferry routes today are: Central to Tsim Sha Tsui and Wan Chai to Tsim Sha Tsui, the Wan Chai/Central to Hung Hom services closing in 2011 for lack of patronage. Other regular ferry services also operate in the harbour. The Hongkong and Yaumati Ferry Company used to operate numerous cross-harbour routes between various piers of Kowloon and Hong Kong Island. Many of the routes are now operated by First Ferry. Some of the piers no longer exist because of reclamation projects, or many of the routes became unprofitable. Currently, the company continues to operate vehicular ferry services for vehicles carrying dangerous goods that are prohibited within tunnel crossings. For international passenger traffic and traffic to mainland China and Macau, there are two ferry terminals, namely Hong Kong-Macau Ferry Terminal and Hong Kong China Ferry Terminal, and a terminal for cruises, the Ocean Terminal. Another cruise terminal (Kai Tak Cruise Terminal) has recently been opened.

Since the 2011 local government reform it is part of the municipality Rhodes, of which it is a municipal unit.Kallikratis law Greece Ministry of Interior The municipal unit has an area of 178.9 km2. It lies on the east coast of the island. It is about 40 km south of the town of Rhodes and its fine beaches make it a popular tourist and holiday destination. Lindos is situated in a large bay and faces the fishing village and small resort of Charaki. History Lindos was founded by the Dorians led by the king Tlepolemus of Rhodes, who arrived in about the 10th century BC. It was one of six Dorian cities in the area known as the Dorian Hexapolis. The eastern location of Rhodes made it a natural meeting place between the Greeks and the Phoenicians, and by the 8th century Lindos was a major trading centre. In the 6th century it was ruled by Cleobulus, one of the Seven Sages of Greece. The importance of Lindos declined after the foundation of the city of Rhodes in the late 5th century BC. In classical times the acropolis of Lindos was dominated by the massive temple of Athena Lindia, which attained its final form in around 300 BC. In Hellenistic and Roman times the temple precinct grew as more buildings were added. In early medieval times these buildings fell into disuse, and in the 14th century they were partly overlaid by a massive fortress built on the acropolis by the Knights of St John to defend the island against the Ottomans. Acropolis Above the modern town rises the acropolis of Lindos, a natural citadel which was fortified successively by the Greeks, the Romans, the Byzantines, the Knights of St John and the Ottomans. This makes the site difficult to excavate and interpret archaeologically. The acropolis has views of the surrounding harbours and coastline. On the acropolis of Lindos today parts of the following buildings may still be seen: Rhodian trireme * The Doric Temple of Athena Lindia, dating from about 300 BC, built on the site of an earlier temple. Inside the temple is the table of offerings and the base of the cult statue of Athena. * The Propylaea of the Sanctuary, also dating from the 4th century BC. A monumental staircase leads to a D-shaped stoa and a wall with five door openings. * The Hellenistic stoa with lateral projecting wings, dating from about 200 BC. The stoa was 87 metres long and consisted of 42 columns. * The well-known relief of a Rhodian trireme (warship) cut into the rock at the foot of the steps leading to the acropolis. On the bow stood a statue of General Hagesander, the work of the sculptor Pythokritos. The relief dates from about 180 BC. * The Hellenistic staircase (2nd century BC) leading to the main archaeological area of the acropolis. * Remains of a Roman temple, possibly dedicated to the Emperor Diocletian and dating from about 300 AD. * The Acropolis is surrounded by a Hellenistic wall contemporary with the Propylaea and the stairway leading to the entrance to the site. A Roman inscription says that the wall and square towers were repaired at the expense of P Aelius Hagetor, the priest of Athena in the 2nd century AD. * The Castle of the Knights of St John, built some time before 1317 on the foundations of older Byzantine fortifications. The walls and towers follow the natural conformation of the cliff. A pentagonal tower on the south side commanded the harbour, the settlement and the road from the south of the island. There was a large round tower on the east facing the sea and two more, one round and the other on a corner, on the northeast side of the enceinte. Today one of the towers at the southwest corner and one to the west survive. * The Greek Orthodox Church of St John, dating from the 13th or 14th century and built on the ruins of a previous church, which may have been built as early as the 6th century. Some scenes of the well-known film, The Guns of Navarone, were filmed here.

Kinch and Christian Blinkenberg. The acropolis site was excavated down to bedrock and the foundations of all the buildings were uncovered. During the Italian occupation of the island (1912‚Äì1945) major restoration work was carried out on the Lindos acropolis, but it was poorly done and was harmful to the historic record. The north-east side of the Temple of Athena was restored. The monumental staircase to the propylaea was rebuilt and many of the columns of the Hellenistic stoa were re-erected. Large surfaces were covered with concrete. Bases and inscribed blocks were taken from their locations and placed along the restored walls. Judged by modern standards, this work took insufficient note of the evidence available from the excavations and in its methods did damage to the remains themselves. In recent years Greek and international archaeologists under the supervision of the Greek Ministry of Culture have been working to restore and protect the ancient buildings on the site. Climate Lindos has a very mild climate and according to the National Observatory of Athens station it registers a mean annual temperature of 21.8 ¬∞C.

Developed by Nintendo's EAD division, it was released in Japan, North America, and Europe in 1998. In 2000, an expansion pack was released in Japan providing numerous extra features not in the original game. F-Zero X was ported in 2004 to the iQue Player in China. The game was re-released on the Wii Virtual Console in Japan, Europe and in North America, in 2007. To honor the 100th Virtual Console release in Europe, it became available on June 15. It was a sequel to the original 1990 F-Zero game, and is the first F-Zero installment to have featured 3D graphics. The game has a steep learning curve and its gameplay experience is similar to that of the original F-Zero game. F-Zero X introduced a \\"death race\\" mode and a random track generator called the \\"X Cup\\". In the death race, the player's objective is to annihilate the 29 other racers as speedily as possible, while the X-Cup \\"creates\\" a different set of tracks each time played. Critics generally praised F-Zero X for its fast gameplay, abundance of courses and vehicles, track design, and maintaining a high framerate. However, the game has been widely criticized for its lack of graphical detail.  Gameplay  alt=Hovercrafts navigate through a giant pipe in a course. Around the edge of the frame are two-dimensional icons relaying game information. F-Zero X is a fast-paced futuristic racing video game where thirty competitors race on high-altitude circuits inside plasma-powered hovercars in an intergalactic Grand Prix.: \\"F-Zero Machines: [...] Using their ultra-compact plasma engines, their maximum speeds can exceed the speed of sound. F-Zero Circuits: Courses for F-Zero are set high above cities.\\" Taking place after the original tournament was discontinued for several years due to the extreme danger of the sport, F-Zero X begins after the Grand Prix is brought back with the rules and regulations revised under the same name as the video game.: [...] As you know, due to the many accidents and dangers involved, the Grand Prix was discontinued for several years. [...] We have changed the competition's name to the F-Zero X GP and have revised the rules and regulations.\\" The tracks in the game include hills, loops, tunnels, corkscrews, and pipes. Players can drift into turns without losing momentum by using the control stick and trigger button. The game introduces 26 new vehicles, and reprises the four from the original F-Zero game. Each has its own performance abilities affected by its size and weight, and a grip, boost, and durability trait graded on an A to E (best to worst) scale.: \\"Each machine has different abilities. Body, Boost and Grip are rated A - E (A being best and E being worst) [...] Each machine is unique, and its abilities depend on its size and weight.\\" Before a race, players are able to adjust a vehicle's balance between maximum acceleration and maximum top speed. Each machine has an energy meter, which serves two purposes. Firstly, it is a measurement of the machine's health and is decreased, for example, when the machine hits another racer or the side of the track.: \\"Energy Meter: As your machine takes damage, your energy meter gradually reduces. [...] When you are on lap number two, the meter color will change from red to green. This means you'll be able to use Boost. You can use Boost as often as you want, but every time you use it, your energy will decrease. Recover energy in the Pit Area (p. 13).\\" The game introduces the ability to attack other racers by either utilizing a side or spin attack. Secondly, it is a boost meter used for manually boosting, usually starting with the second lap of a race. Energy can be replenished by driving over recharge strips, called \\"Pit Areas\\",: \\"In Novice Mode, a pilot will have five spare machines. Four will be available in Standard and three in Expert. One spare machine will be given to a pilot each time he or she retires five competitor machines. 3-3: If a pilot retires and has no spare machine, the game will be over. [...] The amount of energy recovered depends on how much time a pilot spends in the Pit Area.\\" located at various points around the track. The amount of time spent in these areas is relative to amount of energy regenerated. There are also dash plates around the track that give a speed boost without using up any energy. = Race modes = F-Zero X has five different gameplay modes: GP (Grand Prix) Race, Practice, Time Attack, Death Race, and VS Battle. In GP Race, the player races against 29 opponents through three laps of each track in a cup. Players get a certain number of points for finishing a track depending on where they placed, and the winner of the cup is the character who receives the most total points.: \\"A driver who completes a course will receive points. These points will depend on where you finish. The driver with the most points at the end of the sixth course will be declared the winner.\\" If the player has a \\"spare machine\\"‚Äîthe equivalent of an extra life‚Äîthen falls off a track or runs out of energy, the race can be restarted. Each cup has four selectable difficulty levels: Novice, Standard, Expert,: \\"Grand Prix Race: Twenty-nine other contestants will race against you in this one-player circuit. Select Class: Before jumping into the Grand Prix, you'll need to select a difficulty level: Novice, Standard or Expert. The higher the difficulty level, the tougher your opponents.\\" and Master. The higher the difficulty level selected, the tougher the opponents, and less spare machines the player starts with. Furthermore, the three cups initially available are ordered by increasing difficulty (Jack, Queen and King respectively) and have six tracks each. Eventually, the player can unlock the Joker Cup with its set of six tracks, followed by the X Cup. The X Cup is a set of six randomly generated tracks every time played. The randomized track elements lack loops and can be simplistic, but others are intricate. There is a Practice mode which allows the player to practice any track with opponents.: \\"Practice: On the Select Mode screen, select Practice and you can practice the GP (with rivals) in the Cup course of your choosing.\\" Time Attack lets the player choose a track and complete a 3-lap race in the shortest time possible. Transparent re-enactments of Time Attack performances, or ghost data, from the player or game developer can be raced against. Up to three player-contributed ghosts can be raced against simultaneously, but only one can be saved per track.: \\"Time Attack: Select a machine and see if you can finish a course in record time. If your time is fast enough, you'll be able to race against the developer's ghost machine (or Staff Ghost). [...] Race results will appear once you've finished the three-lap race. [...] The Ghost is a translucent machine which mimics your previous performance. Drive with the Ghost and try to improve your time. Up to three Ghost machines can appear in the same race. [...] While up to three ghosts can appear at the same time, you can only save one to memory.\\" Death Race has the player annihilating the 29 other racers as speedily as possible on a specialized course. There is no selectable difficulty level, or set number of laps, but the boost is immediately available.: \\"Death Race: [...] There is only one course and no difficulty level. [...] There is no limit to the number of laps, and Boost can be used right away.\\" Vs. Battle is the multiplayer mode where two to four players compete in a three-lap race, and slots not in use by players can be operated by the artificial intelligence.: \\"In VS Battle, two to four players can play simultaneously [...] Select With and four machines will race in all multi- player modes (machines not used by players will be operated by the computer). [...] Like GP Race, this is a three-lap race.\\" A slot machine for those out of the race early will appear if the option is enabled. Players can adversely affect the energy levels of those still competing by matching symbols.  Development and release In mid-1996, while still working on Mario Kart 64, Shigeru Miyamoto said he planned to make a sequel to F-Zero for the Nintendo 64. Initially titled \\"F-Zero 64\\", Famitsu magazine revealed the project in mid-1997. Tadashi Sugiyama and Shigeru Miyamoto served as director and producer, respectively. Taro Bando and Hajime Wakai served as composers. Several key Wave Race 64 programmers including the lead programmer made up the in-house development team. Developed by Nintendo EAD, it is a sequel to the original 1990 F-Zero game, and was the first F-Zero installment to feature 3D graphics. The game made its debut at the Nintendo Space World event on November 20, 1997 where the public was able to play it for the first time. Nintendo promised that the game would run at a minimum frame rate of 60 frames per second, which was regarded as exceptionally high in the industry. Soon after, IGN reported F-Zero X consistently ran at 60 frames per second. Consequently, background detail and textures were lacking as well as polygon count on vehicles which lessen more so as they pass the player. They noted that \\"[tracks] hide most of the limited backgrounds with their girth and undulating nature which block out almost everything else.\\" Fogging effects are used to hide background shortcomings such as where the sky and ground meet. F-Zero X features remixed music from its predecessor. Due to compression, the game features monaural music tracks, but ambient effects are generated with stereo sound effects. Two soundtracks were released featuring music from this game onto CD. The F-Zero X Original Soundtrack was released on September 18, 1998. The F-Zero X Guitar Arrange Edition, which was released on January 27, 1999, contains ten guitar arranged musical tracks from the game. The game was released in Japan on July 14, 1998, but its North American release suffered from a three-month delay due to Nintendo's policy of spacing the release of first-party games out evenly. It was eventually released on October 26, followed by Europe on November 6. China received a version for the iQue Player on February 25, 2004. It was released on the Wii Virtual Console in 2007, and as the 100th Virtual Console game in Europe.  Critical reception  Overall, critical reception of F-Zero X was positive; the game has an aggregate average of 87.61% based on 15 reviews at GameRankings, and a metascore of 85 at Metacritic. Critics generally praised F-Zero X for its fast gameplay, abundance of courses and vehicles, keeping a high framerate with up to thirty racers on screen at the same time, and track design. However, the game has been widely criticized for its lack of graphical detail. Peer Schneider of IGN described the gameplay as \\"god-like\\", \\"hair-splitting\\" speed; and he considered the game to rival its predecessor Wave Race 64 with its \\"perfectly fine-tuned controls and a fresh approach to racing\\". The title received the Game of the Month award for November 1998 from Electronic Gaming Monthly. An editor stated \\"the graphics may be simple, but they're smooth and the action is fast\\". Next Generation stated that \\"From the rocking guitar tunes (courtesy of the same composer who created the original's music) to the insanely addictive Grand Prix races, the game is a blast.\\" Allgame called F-Zero X as \\"certainly not up to Nintendo's usual standards\\" in terms of detail and texture quality. GameSpot also criticized the game's graphical detail, calling the low polygon count on the vehicles \\"particularly uninspiring\\" and saying that the \\"track detail is also very limited, giving the track a spartan feel to it\\". Although the optimizations are strict, critics exalted the game for managing a steady rate of 60 frames per second, which some thought made up for the lack of graphical detail with little room for improvement. The Electric Playground found the framerate to give \\"the game a major boost in the feel department\\" making it \\"seem like your vehicle is bursting through the sound barrier\\". According to GameSpot, F-Zero X became the first racing game to run at 60 frames per second with up to 30 vehicles on screen at the same time, but in order to keep the frame rate, polygon counts on the vehicles, textures and track detail are sacrificed. In regard to the music, EGM considered it \\"really good with some excellent remixes of the old F-Zero tunes\\", while CVG called the music dreadful. The Electric Playground thought it goes hand-in-hand to the simulation of speed in the game, but the reviewer commented \\"I wouldn't in a million years buy music like this to listen to\\". In GameSpot's retrospective review, they gave it a 6.5/10 calling it \\"the black sheep of the series\\" when compared with the other F-Zero games in \\"visual style and technical flair\\". IGN described F-Zero X as an exceptional update to the original game that \\"only suffers under its generic look\\". Peer Schneider believed that unlike the first game, F-Zero X \\"is not about showing off graphics or sound capabilities -- it's all about gameplay\\". Nintendo sold 383,642 units of F-Zero X in North America and 97,684 units in Japan. In its first week of sale in Japan, 56,457 copies were sold, but only about one fifth of that in the following week reportedly due to the Nintendo 64 having had a small dedicated fanbase there.  Disk drive expansion  F-Zero X Expansion Kit, released in Japan on April 21, 2000, is the first expansion disk for the 64DD, Nintendo's disk drive peripheral for the Nintendo 64. F-Zero X was programmed with \\"64DD hooks\\", which allow it to detect whether the 64DD is connected and compatible expansion software is loaded. This allows the cartridge-based game to be compatible with expansion disks such as track editors or course updates; however, none of these were utilized outside Japan due to the 64DD's commercial failure. Expansion Kit will only operate in conjunction with the cartridge of the original game. However, all of F-Zero Xs regular features are accessible in addition to twelve new tracks, a car editor and a track creator. As the Expansion Kit benefits from a larger amount of storage on disk when compared to the original cartridge version, it includes new soundtracks in stereophonic sound as well as the entire collection of monaural audio tracks from the original game. In addition to the two new cups, it is also possible to create custom cups. The disk can save up to a hundred tracks and up to three ghost racers per course. IGN singled out the track creator as the F-Zero X Expansion Kits strongest feature since it is virtually the same tool the designers of F-Zero X used for themselves to create the original circuits. The Car Editor offers a variety of options when creating a vehicle. Using a set of pre-existing parts, the player must balance their creations' settings and performance abilities before the machine is finished and named. The Track Editor is a detailed track creator that allows the player to design their own racing circuits. Using a cursor, the player can determine the basic layout of the track and also add points to it to create track elements such as curves and hills. Furthermore, numerous different properties like half pipes and cylinders, as well as numerous road surfaces, such as slip zones, can be added. The player can test the creation at any time and run practice laps.

Early career Squires was born in Harbour Grace, Newfoundland in 1880. He started out practising law in St. John's. He served as a member in the government of Edward Patrick Morris from 1913 to 1918. In 1919, Squires started a campaign for the vacant leadership of the Liberal Party. He won the leadership over William Warren. Prime minister Squires won the election of 1919 over Sir Michael Cashin of the Newfoundland People's Party (later called the Liberal-Labour-Progressive Party). He did this by forming an alliance with the Fisherman's Protective Union of William Coaker under the name of the Liberal Reform Party. During his first government, Squires started the development of the Humber River. He also attempted many reforms suggested by Coaker. These reforms would have regulated the fishery but failed because of a collapse in fish prices which was blamed on Coaker's reforms. Squires's government attempted to diversify the economy and, to this end, financially assisted the failing transinsular railway operated by the Reid Newfoundland Company, finally nationalizing the railway in 1923. Fall from power Squires's government was accused of using bribes to win the 1923 General Election. A cabinet minister Dr. Alex A. Campbell was in the centre of the scandal. Several other cabinet members demanded Campbell be forced to resign. When Squires refused they said they would cross the floor. The Attorney General William Warren issued an arrest warrant for Squires. Squires was arrested and later released on bond. He then resigned as Prime Minister. Opposition Squires remained in the House of Assembly, as an independent member. In the next year, Newfoundland saw four governments fall. It was not until Walter Monroe won the 1924 election that stability was restored. Squires remained in the background working on a possible return to power. In 1928 Walter Monroe resigned as Prime Minister and was replaced by his cousin Frederick C. Alderdice. In the election of 1928, Squires returned as Liberal leader and defeated the Conservatives. Governing in the Depression His next government started out well, seeing the election of his wife Helena Squires as the first woman to sit in the House of Assembly. However, Newfoundland was struck hard by the Great Depression; fish prices fell and an already severe public debt worsened. In 1932 Canada refused his request to join the Canadian Confederation. Widespread unemployment caused by the Great Depression and allegations of corruption against Squires and his government along with the government's inability to deal with the economic crisis created widespread discontent and political instability. In 1932, Squires's finance minister, Peter John Cashin, resigned from the executive council accusing his fellow cabinet ministers of widespread corruption and Squires himself of having falsified council minutes to hide the fact that he had been receiving secret payments out of public funds. Cashin's charge inflamed a public which had already been seized by discontent due to the deteriorating economic situation in the country. On April 5, 1932, a large parade was organized by the opposition. They marched to the Colonial Building which was the seat of the House of Assembly. There were over 10,000 people at the protest and things got out of control, leading to the 1932 Colonial Building riot. The riot at the Colonial Building in 1932 The crowd got angry when no one came out to address them. After a short while, several people managed to break into the building. Squires and government members had to escape around the back. Squires was nearly caught trying to get into a cab; he got away only by running through a house on Colonial Street (near the Colonial Building) to a waiting cab on Bannerman Street. Fall from power Squires had little choice but to dissolve his government and call an election, the result of which was the defeat of the Liberal government and the loss of Squires's own seat. The Liberals won only two seats out of 28. Alderdice, who was still leader of the opposition, came to power and went about putting into place a Commission of Government. Squires retired but always remained active in his opposition to the Commission of Government. He died at the age of 60, in 1940. At the time of his death he was Worshipful Grand Master of the Grand Orange Lodge of British America, one of the few democratic institutions operating during the Commission of Government period.

It contains small deciduous trees or large shrubs commonly known as redbuds. They are characterised by simple, rounded to heart-shaped leaves and pinkish-red flowers borne in the early spring on bare leafless shoots, on both branches and trunk (\\"cauliflory\\"). Cercis is derived from the Greek word Œ∫ŒµœÅŒ∫ŒπœÇ (kerkis) meaning \\"weaver's shuttle\\", which was applied by Theophrastus to C. siliquastrum.

The Judas tree (Cercis siliquastrum) is 10‚Äì15 m tall tree native to the south of Europe and southwest Asia. It is found in Iberia, southern France, Italy, Bulgaria, Greece and Asia Minor, and forms a low tree with a flat spreading head. In early spring it is covered with a profusion of magenta flowers which appear before the leaves. The flowers are edible and are sometimes eaten in a mixed salad or made into fritters with a flavor described as an agreeably acidic bite. The tree frequently figured in the 16th and 17th century herbals. It is said to be the tree from which Judas Iscariot hanged himself after betraying Christ, but the name may also derive from \\"Judea's tree\\", after the region encompassing Israel and Palestine where the tree is commonplace. A smaller Eastern American woodland understory tree, the eastern redbud, Cercis canadensis, is common from southernmost Canada to Piedmont, Alabama and East Texas. It differs from C. siliquastrum in its pointed leaves and slightly smaller size (rarely over 12 m tall). The flowers are also used in salads and for making pickled relish, while the inner bark of twigs gives a mustard-yellow dye. It is commonly grown as an ornamental. The related western redbud, Cercis occidentalis, ranges from California east to Utah primarily in foothill regions. Its leaves are more rounded at the tip than the relatively heart-shaped leaves of the eastern redbud. The tree often forms multi-trunked colonies that are covered in bright pink flowers in early spring (February - March). White-flowered variants are in cultivation. It buds only once a year. The chain-flowered redbud (Cercis racemosa) from western China is unusual in the genus in having its flowers in pendulous racemes, as in a Laburnum, rather than short clusters. Species names with uncertain taxonomic status The status of the following species is unresolved: * Cercis dilatata Greene * Cercis ellipsoidea Greene * Cercis florida Salisb. * Cercis funiushanensis S.Y.Wang & T.B.Chao * Cercis georgiana Greene * Cercis gigantea ined.‚Äîgiant redbud (China) * Cercis japonica Siebold ex Planch. * Cercis latissima Greene * Cercis nephrophylla Greene * Cercis nitida Greene * Cercis pumila W.

These include Drinfeld‚ÄìJimbo type quantum groups (which are quasitriangular Hopf algebras), compact matrix quantum groups (which are structures on unital separable C*-algebras), and bicrossproduct quantum groups. The term \\"quantum group\\" first appeared in the theory of quantum integrable systems, which was then formalized by Vladimir Drinfeld and Michio Jimbo as a particular class of Hopf algebra. The same term is also used for other Hopf algebras that deform or are close to classical Lie groups or Lie algebras, such as a \\"bicrossproduct\\" class of quantum groups introduced by Shahn Majid a little after the work of Drinfeld and Jimbo. In Drinfeld's approach, quantum groups arise as Hopf algebras depending on an auxiliary parameter q or h, which become universal enveloping algebras of a certain Lie algebra, frequently semisimple or affine, when q = 1 or h = 0. Closely related are certain dual objects, also Hopf algebras and also called quantum groups, deforming the algebra of functions on the corresponding semisimple algebraic group or a compact Lie group.  Intuitive meaning  The discovery of quantum groups was quite unexpected since it was known for a long time that compact groups and semisimple Lie algebras are \\"rigid\\" objects, in other words, they cannot be \\"deformed\\". One of the ideas behind quantum groups is that if we consider a structure that is in a sense equivalent but larger, namely a group algebra or a universal enveloping algebra, then a group or enveloping algebra can be \\"deformed\\", although the deformation will no longer remain a group or enveloping algebra. More precisely, deformation can be accomplished within the category of Hopf algebras that are not required to be either commutative or cocommutative. One can think of the deformed object as an algebra of functions on a \\"noncommutative space\\", in the spirit of the noncommutative geometry of Alain Connes. This intuition, however, came after particular classes of quantum groups had already proved their usefulness in the study of the quantum Yang‚ÄìBaxter equation and quantum inverse scattering method developed by the Leningrad School (Ludwig Faddeev, Leon Takhtajan, Evgeny Sklyanin, Nicolai Reshetikhin and Vladimir Korepin) and related work by the Japanese School. The intuition behind the second, bicrossproduct, class of quantum groups was different and came from the search for self-dual objects as an approach to quantum gravity. Drinfeld‚ÄìJimbo type quantum groups One type of objects commonly called a \\"quantum group\\" appeared in the work of Vladimir Drinfeld and Michio Jimbo as a deformation of the universal enveloping algebra of a semisimple Lie algebra or, more generally, a Kac‚ÄìMoody algebra, in the category of Hopf algebras. The resulting algebra has additional structure, making it into a quasitriangular Hopf algebra. Let A = (aij) be the Cartan matrix of the Kac‚ÄìMoody algebra, and let q ‚â† 0, 1 be a complex number, then the quantum group, Uq(G), where G is the Lie algebra whose Cartan matrix is A, is defined as the unital associative algebra with generators kŒª (where Œª is an element of the weight lattice, i.e. 2(Œª, Œ±i)/(Œ±i, Œ±i) is an integer for all i), and ei and fi (for simple roots, Œ±i), subject to the following relations: :\\\\begin{align} k_0 &= 1 \\\\\\\\\\\\ k_\\\\lambda k_\\\\mu &= k_{\\\\lambda+\\\\mu} \\\\\\\\\\\\ k_\\\\lambda e_i k_\\\\lambda^{-1} &= q^{(\\\\lambda,\\\\alpha_i)} e_i \\\\\\\\\\\\ k_\\\\lambda f_i k_\\\\lambda^{-1} &= q^{- (\\\\lambda,\\\\alpha_i)} f_i \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\left [e_i, f_j \\\\right ] &= \\\\delta_{ij} \\\\frac{k_i - k_i^{-1}}{q_i - q_i^{-1}} && k_i = k_{\\\\alpha_i}, q_i = q^{\\\\frac{1}{2}(\\\\alpha_i,\\\\alpha_i)} \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\end{align} And for i ‚â† j we have the q-Serre relations, which are deformations of the Serre relations: :\\\\begin{align} \\\\sum_{n=0}^{1 - a_{ij}} (-1)^n \\\\frac{[1 - a_{ij}]_{q_i}!}{[1 - a_{ij} - n]_{q_i}! [n]_{q_i}!} e_i^n e_j e_i^{1 - a_{ij} - n} &= 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[6pt] \\\\sum_{n=0}^{1 - a_{ij}} (-1)^n \\\\frac{[1 - a_{ij}]_{q_i}!}{[1 - a_{ij} - n]_{q_i}! [n]_{q_i}!} f_i^n f_j f_i^{1 - a_{ij} - n} &= 0 \\\\end{align} where the q-factorial, the q-analog of the ordinary factorial, is defined recursively using q-number: :\\\\begin{align} {[0]}_{q_i}! &= 1 \\\\\\\\\\\\ {[n]}_{q_i}! &= \\\\prod_{m=1}^n [m]_{q_i}, && [m]_{q_i} = \\\\frac{q_i^m - q_i^{-m}}{q_i - q_i^{-1}} \\\\end{align} In the limit as q ‚Üí 1, these relations approach the relations for the universal enveloping algebra U(G), where :k_{\\\\lambda} \\\\to 1, \\\\qquad \\\\frac{k_\\\\lambda - k_{-\\\\lambda}}{q - q^{-1}} \\\\to t_\\\\lambda and tŒª is the element of the Cartan subalgebra satisfying (tŒª, h) = Œª(h) for all h in the Cartan subalgebra. There are various coassociative coproducts under which these algebras are Hopf algebras, for example, : \\\\begin{array}{lll} \\\\Delta_1(k_\\\\lambda) = k_\\\\lambda \\\\otimes k_\\\\lambda & \\\\Delta_1(e_i) = 1 \\\\otimes e_i + e_i \\\\otimes k_i & \\\\Delta_1(f_i) = k_i^{-1} \\\\otimes f_i + f_i \\\\otimes 1 \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\Delta_2(k_\\\\lambda) = k_\\\\lambda \\\\otimes k_\\\\lambda & \\\\Delta_2(e_i) = k_i^{-1} \\\\otimes e_i + e_i \\\\otimes 1 & \\\\Delta_2(f_i) = 1 \\\\otimes f_i + f_i \\\\otimes k_i \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\Delta_3(k_\\\\lambda) = k_\\\\lambda \\\\otimes k_\\\\lambda & \\\\Delta_3(e_i) = k_i^{-\\\\frac{1}{2}} \\\\otimes e_i + e_i \\\\otimes k_i^{\\\\frac{1}{2}} & \\\\Delta_3(f_i) = k_i^{-\\\\frac{1}{2}} \\\\otimes f_i + f_i \\\\otimes k_i^{\\\\frac{1}{2}} \\\\end{array} where the set of generators has been extended, if required, to include kŒª for Œª which is expressible as the sum of an element of the weight lattice and half an element of the root lattice. In addition, any Hopf algebra leads to another with reversed coproduct T o Œî, where T is given by T(x ‚äó y) = y ‚äó x, giving three more possible versions. The counit on Uq(A) is the same for all these coproducts: Œµ(kŒª) = 1, Œµ(ei) = Œµ(fi) = 0, and the respective antipodes for the above coproducts are given by : \\\\begin{array}{lll} S_1(k_\\\\lambda) = k_{-\\\\lambda} & S_1(e_i) = - e_i k_i^{-1} & S_1(f_i) = - k_i f_i \\\\\\\\\\\\ S_2(k_\\\\lambda) = k_{-\\\\lambda} & S_2(e_i) = - k_i e_i & S_2(f_i) = - f_i k_i^{-1} \\\\\\\\\\\\ S_3(k_\\\\lambda) = k_{-\\\\lambda} & S_3(e_i) = - q_i e_i & S_3(f_i) = - q_i^{-1} f_i \\\\end{array} Alternatively, the quantum group Uq(G) can be regarded as an algebra over the field C(q), the field of all rational functions of an indeterminate q over C. Similarly, the quantum group Uq(G) can be regarded as an algebra over the field Q(q), the field of all rational functions of an indeterminate q over Q (see below in the section on quantum groups at q = 0). The center of quantum group can be described by quantum determinant. =Representation theory= Just as there are many different types of representations for Kac‚ÄìMoody algebras and their universal enveloping algebras, so there are many different types of representation for quantum groups. As is the case for all Hopf algebras, Uq(G) has an adjoint representation on itself as a module, with the action being given by :\\\\mathrm{Ad}_x \\\\cdot y = \\\\sum_{(x)} x_{(1)} y S(x_{(2)}), where :\\\\Delta(x) = \\\\sum_{(x)} x_{(1)} \\\\otimes x_{(2)}. Case 1: q is not a root of unity One important type of representation is a weight representation, and the corresponding module is called a weight module. A weight module is a module with a basis of weight vectors. A weight vector is a nonzero vector v such that kŒª ¬∑ v = dŒªv for all Œª, where dŒª are complex numbers for all weights Œª such that :d_0 = 1, :d_\\\\lambda d_\\\\mu = d_{\\\\lambda + \\\\mu}, for all weights Œª and Œº. A weight module is called integrable if the actions of ei and fi are locally nilpotent (i.e. for any vector v in the module, there exists a positive integer k, possibly dependent on v, such that e_i^k.v = f_i^k.v = 0 for all i). In the case of integrable modules, the complex numbers dŒª associated with a weight vector satisfy d_\\\\lambda = c_\\\\lambda q^{(\\\\lambda, u)}, where ŒΩ is an element of the weight lattice, and cŒª are complex numbers such that :*c_0 = 1, :*c_\\\\lambda c_\\\\mu = c_{\\\\lambda + \\\\mu}, for all weights Œª and Œº, :*c_{2\\\\alpha_i} = 1 for all i. Of special interest are highest-weight representations, and the corresponding highest weight modules. A highest weight module is a module generated by a weight vector v, subject to kŒª ¬∑ v = dŒªv for all weights Œº, and ei ¬∑ v = 0 for all i. Similarly, a quantum group can have a lowest weight representation and lowest weight module, i.e. a module generated by a weight vector v, subject to kŒª ¬∑ v = dŒªv for all weights Œª, and fi ¬∑ v = 0 for all i. Define a vector v to have weight ŒΩ if k_\\\\lambda\\\\cdot v = q^{(\\\\lambda, u)} v for all Œª in the weight lattice. If G is a Kac‚ÄìMoody algebra, then in any irreducible highest weight representation of Uq(G), with highest weight ŒΩ, the multiplicities of the weights are equal to their multiplicities in an irreducible representation of U(G) with equal highest weight. If the highest weight is dominant and integral (a weight Œº is dominant and integral if Œº satisfies the condition that 2 (\\\\mu,\\\\alpha_i)/(\\\\alpha_i,\\\\alpha_i) is a non-negative integer for all i), then the weight spectrum of the irreducible representation is invariant under the Weyl group for G, and the representation is integrable. Conversely, if a highest weight module is integrable, then its highest weight vector v satisfies k_\\\\lambda\\\\cdot v = c_\\\\lambda q^{(\\\\lambda, u)} v, where cŒª ¬∑ v = dŒªv are complex numbers such that :*c_0 = 1, :*c_\\\\lambda c_\\\\mu = c_{\\\\lambda + \\\\mu}, for all weights Œª and Œº, :*c_{2\\\\alpha_i} = 1 for all i, and ŒΩ is dominant and integral. As is the case for all Hopf algebras, the tensor product of two modules is another module. For an element x of Uq(G), and for vectors v and w in the respective modules, x ‚ãÖ (v ‚äó w) = Œî(x) ‚ãÖ (v ‚äó w), so that k_\\\\lambda\\\\cdot(v \\\\otimes w) = k_\\\\lambda\\\\cdot v \\\\otimes k_\\\\lambda.w, and in the case of coproduct Œî1, e_i\\\\cdot(v \\\\otimes w) = k_i\\\\cdot v \\\\otimes e_i\\\\cdot w + e_i\\\\cdot v \\\\otimes w and f_i\\\\cdot(v \\\\otimes w) = v \\\\otimes f_i\\\\cdot w + f_i\\\\cdot v \\\\otimes k_i^{-1}\\\\cdot w. The integrable highest weight module described above is a tensor product of a one-dimensional module (on which kŒª = cŒª for all Œª, and ei = fi = 0 for all i) and a highest weight module generated by a nonzero vector v0, subject to k_\\\\lambda\\\\cdot v_0 = q^{(\\\\lambda, u)} v_0 for all weights Œª, and e_i\\\\cdot v_0 = 0 for all i. In the specific case where G is a finite-dimensional Lie algebra (as a special case of a Kac‚ÄìMoody algebra), then the irreducible representations with dominant integral highest weights are also finite-dimensional. In the case of a tensor product of highest weight modules, its decomposition into submodules is the same as for the tensor product of the corresponding modules of the Kac‚ÄìMoody algebra (the highest weights are the same, as are their multiplicities). Case 2: q is a root of unity =Quasitriangularity= Case 1: q is not a root of unity Strictly, the quantum group Uq(G) is not quasitriangular, but it can be thought of as being \\"nearly quasitriangular\\" in that there exists an infinite formal sum which plays the role of an R-matrix. This infinite formal sum is expressible in terms of generators ei and fi, and Cartan generators tŒª, where kŒª is formally identified with qtŒª. The infinite formal sum is the product of two factors, :q^{\\\\eta \\\\sum_j t_{\\\\lambda_j} \\\\otimes t_{\\\\mu_j}} and an infinite formal sum, where Œªj is a basis for the dual space to the Cartan subalgebra, and Œºj is the dual basis, and Œ∑ = ¬±1. The formal infinite sum which plays the part of the R-matrix has a well-defined action on the tensor product of two irreducible highest weight modules, and also on the tensor product of two lowest weight modules. Specifically, if v has weight Œ± and w has weight Œ≤, then :q^{\\\\eta \\\\sum_j t_{\\\\lambda_j} \\\\otimes t_{\\\\mu_j}}\\\\cdot(v \\\\otimes w) = q^{\\\\eta (\\\\alpha,\\\\beta)} v \\\\otimes w, and the fact that the modules are both highest weight modules or both lowest weight modules reduces the action of the other factor on v ‚äó W to a finite sum. Specifically, if V is a highest weight module, then the formal infinite sum, R, has a well-defined, and invertible, action on V ‚äó V, and this value of R (as an element of End(V ‚äó V)) satisfies the Yang‚ÄìBaxter equation, and therefore allows us to determine a representation of the braid group, and to define quasi-invariants for knots, links and braids. Case 2: q is a root of unity =Quantum groups at q = 0= Masaki Kashiwara has researched the limiting behaviour of quantum groups as q ‚Üí 0, and found a particularly well behaved base called a crystal base. =Description and classification by root-systems and Dynkin diagrams= There has been considerable progress in describing finite quotients of quantum groups such as the above Uq(g) for qn = 1; one usually considers the class of pointed Hopf algebras, meaning that all subcoideals are 1-dimensional and thus there sum form a group called coradical: * In 2002 H.-J. Schneider and N. Andruskiewitsch Andruskiewitsch, Schneider: Pointed Hopf algebras, New directions in Hopf algebras, 1‚Äì68, Math. Sci. Res. Inst. Publ., 43, Cambridge Univ. Press, Cambridge, 2002. finished their classification of pointed Hopf algebras with an abelian co-radical group (excluding primes 2, 3, 5, 7), especially as the above finite quotients of Uq(g) decompose into E‚Ä≤s (Borel part), dual F‚Ä≤s and K‚Ä≤s (Cartan algebra) just like ordinary Semisimple Lie algebras: ::\\\\left(\\\\mathfrak{B}(V)\\\\otimes k[\\\\mathbf{Z}^n]\\\\otimes\\\\mathfrak{B}(V^*)\\\\right)^\\\\sigma :Here, as in the classical theory V is a braided vector space of dimension n spanned by the E‚Ä≤s, and œÉ (a so-called cocylce twist) creates the nontrivial linking between E‚Ä≤s and F‚Ä≤s. Note that in contrast to classical theory, more than two linked components may appear. The role of the quantum Borel algebra is taken by a Nichols algebra \\\\mathfrak{B}(V) of the braided vectorspace. generalized Dynkin diagram for a pointed Hopf algebra linking four A3 copies * A crucial ingredient was I. Heckenberger's classification of finite Nichols algebras for abelian groups in terms of generalized Dynkin diagrams.Heckenberger: Nichols algebras of diagonal type and arithmetic root systems, Habilitation thesis 2005. When small primes are present, some exotic examples, such as a triangle, occur (see also the Figure of a rank 3 Dankin diagram). A rank 3 Dynkin diagram associated to a finite-dimensional Nichols algebra * Meanwhile, Schneider and HeckenbergerHeckenberger, Schneider: Root system and Weyl gruppoid for Nichols algebras, 2008. have generally proven the existence of an arithmetic root system also in the nonabelian case, generating a PBW basis as proven by Kharcheko in the abelian case (without the assumption on finite dimension). This can be usedHeckenberger, Schneider: Right coideal subalgebras of Nichols algebras and the Duflo order of the Weyl grupoid, 2009. on specific cases Uq(g) and explains e.g. the numerical coincidence between certain coideal subalgebras of these quantum groups and the order of the Weyl group of the Lie algebra g. Compact matrix quantum groups S. L. Woronowicz introduced compact matrix quantum groups. Compact matrix quantum groups are abstract structures on which the \\"continuous functions\\" on the structure are given by elements of a C*-algebra. The geometry of a compact matrix quantum group is a special case of a noncommutative geometry. The continuous complex- valued functions on a compact Hausdorff topological space form a commutative C*-algebra. By the Gelfand theorem, a commutative C*-algebra is isomorphic to the C*-algebra of continuous complex-valued functions on a compact Hausdorff topological space, and the topological space is uniquely determined by the C*-algebra up to homeomorphism. For a compact topological group, G, there exists a C*-algebra homomorphism Œî: C(G) ‚Üí C(G) ‚äó C(G) (where C(G) ‚äó C(G) is the C*-algebra tensor product - the completion of the algebraic tensor product of C(G) and C(G)), such that Œî(f)(x, y) = f(xy) for all f ‚àà C(G), and for all x, y ‚àà G (where (f ‚äó g)(x, y) = f(x)g(y) for all f, g ‚àà C(G) and all x, y ‚àà G). There also exists a linear multiplicative mapping Œ∫: C(G) ‚Üí C(G), such that Œ∫(f)(x) = f(x‚àí1) for all f ‚àà C(G) and all x ‚àà G. Strictly, this does not make C(G) a Hopf algebra, unless G is finite. On the other hand, a finite- dimensional representation of G can be used to generate a *-subalgebra of C(G) which is also a Hopf *-algebra. Specifically, if g \\\\mapsto (u_{ij}(g))_{i,j} is an n-dimensional representation of G, then for all i, j uij ‚àà C(G) and :\\\\Delta(u_{ij}) = \\\\sum_k u_{ik} \\\\otimes u_{kj}. It follows that the *-algebra generated by uij for all i, j and Œ∫(uij) for all i, j is a Hopf *-algebra: the counit is determined by Œµ(uij) = Œ¥ij for all i, j (where Œ¥ij is the Kronecker delta), the antipode is Œ∫, and the unit is given by :1 = \\\\sum_k u_{1k} \\\\kappa(u_{k1}) = \\\\sum_k \\\\kappa(u_{1k}) u_{k1}. =General definition= As a generalization, a compact matrix quantum group is defined as a pair (C, u), where C is a C*-algebra and u = (u_{ij})_{i,j = 1,\\\\dots,n} is a matrix with entries in C such that :*The *-subalgebra, C0, of C, which is generated by the matrix elements of u, is dense in C; :*There exists a C*-algebra homomorphism called the comultiplication Œî: C ‚Üí C ‚äó C (where C ‚äó C is the C*-algebra tensor product - the completion of the algebraic tensor product of C and C) such that for all i, j we have: :::\\\\Delta(u_{ij}) = \\\\sum_k u_{ik} \\\\otimes u_{kj} :*There exists a linear antimultiplicative map Œ∫: C0 ‚Üí C0 (the coinverse) such that Œ∫(Œ∫(v*)*) = v for all v ‚àà C0 and :::\\\\sum_k \\\\kappa(u_{ik}) u_{kj} = \\\\sum_k u_{ik} \\\\kappa(u_{kj}) = \\\\delta_{ij} I, where I is the identity element of C. Since Œ∫ is antimultiplicative, then Œ∫(vw) = Œ∫(w) Œ∫(v) for all v, w in C0. As a consequence of continuity, the comultiplication on C is coassociative. In general, C is not a bialgebra, and C0 is a Hopf *-algebra. Informally, C can be regarded as the *-algebra of continuous complex-valued functions over the compact matrix quantum group, and u can be regarded as a finite-dimensional representation of the compact matrix quantum group. =Representations= A representation of the compact matrix quantum group is given by a corepresentation of the Hopf *-algebra (a corepresentation of a counital coassociative coalgebra A is a square matrix v = (v_{ij})_{i,j = 1,\\\\dots,n} with entries in A (so v belongs to M(n, A)) such that :\\\\Delta(v_{ij}) = \\\\sum_{k=1}^n v_{ik} \\\\otimes v_{kj} for all i, j and Œµ(vij) = Œ¥ij for all i, j). Furthermore, a representation v, is called unitary if the matrix for v is unitary (or equivalently, if Œ∫(vij) = v*ij for all i, j). =Example= An example of a compact matrix quantum group is SUŒº(2), where the parameter Œº is a positive real number. So SUŒº(2) = (C(SUŒº(2)), u), where C(SUŒº(2)) is the C*-algebra generated by Œ± and Œ≥, subject to :\\\\gamma \\\\gamma^* = \\\\gamma^* \\\\gamma, :\\\\alpha \\\\gamma = \\\\mu \\\\gamma \\\\alpha, :\\\\alpha \\\\gamma^* = \\\\mu \\\\gamma^* \\\\alpha, :\\\\alpha \\\\alpha^* + \\\\mu \\\\gamma^* \\\\gamma = \\\\alpha^* \\\\alpha + \\\\mu^{-1} \\\\gamma^* \\\\gamma = I, and :u = \\\\left( \\\\begin{matrix} \\\\alpha & \\\\gamma \\\\\\\\\\\\ - \\\\gamma^* & \\\\alpha^* \\\\end{matrix} \\\\right), so that the comultiplication is determined by ‚àÜ(Œ±) = Œ± ‚äó Œ± ‚àí Œ≥ ‚äó Œ≥*, ‚àÜ(Œ≥) = Œ± ‚äó Œ≥ + Œ≥ ‚äó Œ±*, and the coinverse is determined by Œ∫(Œ±) = Œ±*, Œ∫(Œ≥) = ‚àíŒº‚àí1Œ≥, Œ∫(Œ≥*) = ‚àíŒºŒ≥*, Œ∫(Œ±*) = Œ±. Note that u is a representation, but not a unitary representation. u is equivalent to the unitary representation :v = \\\\left( \\\\begin{matrix} \\\\alpha & \\\\sqrt{\\\\mu} \\\\gamma \\\\\\\\\\\\ - \\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{\\\\mu}} \\\\gamma^* & \\\\alpha^* \\\\end{matrix} \\\\right). Equivalently, SUŒº(2) = (C(SUŒº(2)), w), where C(SUŒº(2)) is the C*-algebra generated by Œ± and Œ≤, subject to :\\\\beta \\\\beta^* = \\\\beta^* \\\\beta, :\\\\alpha \\\\beta = \\\\mu \\\\beta \\\\alpha, :\\\\alpha \\\\beta^* = \\\\mu \\\\beta^* \\\\alpha, :\\\\alpha \\\\alpha^* + \\\\mu^2 \\\\beta^* \\\\beta = \\\\alpha^* \\\\alpha + \\\\beta^* \\\\beta = I, and :w = \\\\left( \\\\begin{matrix} \\\\alpha & \\\\mu \\\\beta \\\\\\\\\\\\ - \\\\beta^* & \\\\alpha^* \\\\end{matrix} \\\\right), so that the comultiplication is determined by ‚àÜ(Œ±) = Œ± ‚äó Œ± ‚àí ŒºŒ≤ ‚äó Œ≤*, Œî(Œ≤) = Œ± ‚äó Œ≤ + Œ≤ ‚äó Œ±*, and the coinverse is determined by Œ∫(Œ±) = Œ±*, Œ∫(Œ≤) = ‚àíŒº‚àí1Œ≤, Œ∫(Œ≤*) = ‚àíŒºŒ≤*, Œ∫(Œ±*) = Œ±. Note that w is a unitary representation. The realizations can be identified by equating \\\\gamma = \\\\sqrt{\\\\mu} \\\\beta. When Œº = 1, then SUŒº(2) is equal to the algebra C(SU(2)) of functions on the concrete compact group SU(2). Bicrossproduct quantum groups Whereas compact matrix pseudogroups are typically versions of Drinfeld-Jimbo quantum groups in a dual function algebra formulation, with additional structure, the bicrossproduct ones are a distinct second family of quantum groups of increasing importance as deformations of solvable rather than semisimple Lie groups. They are associated to Lie splittings of Lie algebras or local factorisations of Lie groups and can be viewed as the cross product or Mackey quantisation of one of the factors acting on the other for the algebra and a similar story for the coproduct Œî with the second factor acting back on the first. The very simplest nontrivial example corresponds to two copies of R locally acting on each other and results in a quantum group (given here in an algebraic form) with generators p, K, K‚àí1, say, and coproduct :[p, K]=h K(K-1) :\\\\Delta p=p\\\\otimes K+1\\\\otimes p :\\\\Delta K=K\\\\otimes K where h is the deformation parameter. This quantum group was linked to a toy model of Planck scale physics implementing Born reciprocity when viewed as a deformation of the Heisenberg algebra of quantum mechanics. Also, starting with any compact real form of a semisimple Lie algebra g its complexification as a real Lie algebra of twice the dimension splits into g and a certain solvable Lie algebra (the Iwasawa decomposition), and this provides a canonical bicrossproduct quantum group associated to g. For su(2) one obtains a quantum group deformation of the Euclidean group E(3) of motions in 3 dimensions.

It worked so amazingly well that a neighbor asked to come along as his assistant. His next scheme was to make the \\"Garibaldi Society\\" (inspired by a statue in Washington Square Park), whose raison d'√™tre was to reject anyone who applied for membership, designing an impressive logo, application, and rejection letter.

Juster, Feiffer, and another friend rented an apartment on State Street. Juster also resorted to pulling pranks occasionally on Feiffer.xxiii. Juster's children's novel, The Phantom Tollbooth, was published in 1961, with Feiffer doing the drawings. Although he enjoyed writing, his architectural career remained his primary emphasis. He served as a professor of architecture and environmental design at Hampshire College from its first trimester in 1970 until his retirement in 1992.

The present school was formed in 1997 by the amalgamation of the original Berkhamsted School, founded in 1541 by John Incent, Dean of St Paul's Cathedral, Berkhamsted School for Girls, established in 1888, and Berkhamsted Preparatory School. The new merged school was initially called Berkhamsted Collegiate School, but reverted to Berkhamsted School in 2008. In 2011 Berkhamsted School merged with Heatherton House School, a girls' preparatory school in Amersham, to form the Berkhamsted Schools Group. The Group acquired Haresfoot School in Berkhamsted and its on site day nursery in 2012, which became Berkhamsted Pre-Preparatory School for children aged three to seven, and Berkhamsted Day Nursery. Berkhamsted School is a \\"diamond school\\" in which pupils are taught coeducationally in the Pre-Prep School, Prep School and Sixth Form, but independently in the traditional Senior years, between the ages of 11 and 16. The school has four main sites: the Pre-Prep School, the Prep School, the Castle Street Campus and Kings Road Campus (the latter two being the original boys' and girls' schools respectively). The School is noted for its distinctive collegiate and pastoral structure, a varied sporting, outdoor education and cultural co-curricular programme and participation in the life of the local community. Richard Backhouse, previously principal of Monkton Combe School, became Principal of the School in January 2016. House system All Berkhamsted pupils belong to a House throughout their time at the School. Each House is run by a House-master supported by several house tutors. Together they are responsible for providing pastoral support for their pupils and serve as the primary link between parents and the School. Houses are both physical environments and communities, each forming a distinct entity within the larger organisation of the School itself. Pupils attend their house for morning and afternoon registration, to play games throughout the day, and for the majority of the administration which governs their time at the School. They also participate in School events on behalf of their House. =Senior boys' houses= Lych gate and chapel of the Castle Street Campus (formerly the Boys' School) Kings Campus (formerly the Girls' School) *Adders was formed in 1915 to accommodate the so-called \\"train boys\\" who, by nature of their daily commute to school, were often excluded from School activities. Various explanations have been given for the name 'Adders'. It may be a casual abbreviation of \\"the add-on house\\", or a contraction of 'Adlebert House', now the Chaplain's residence. However, according to an anecdote current in the 1960s, the boys were asked for suggestions and one proposed the present name (\\"Bees\\" and \\"Swifts\\" already existed). On being asked why, he explained, \\"Puff adders, sir!\\", an allusion to the steam trains on which the pupils travelled. Adders is situated in a separate building next to Newcroft and it takes the ground floor while Fry's house uses the top floor. Current Head of House is Richard Margerison. *Bartrum the newest house, founded in 2019. *Bees, dating back to 1897 and situated on Mill Street next to Swifts. Current Head of House is Sarah Bugeja. *Cox's, opened in 1958 in response to the growing numbers of day boys. Named after Cuthbert Cox. Until September 2010, the house occupied a separate building located next to the Tesco carpark. Cox's moved from its present location to the site of the old swimming pool, sharing with Tilmans. The former Cox's house was renovated into a new Drama Studio. Current Head of House is Jessica Thackaray. *Fry's is named after one of Berkhamsted's most successful Headmasters ‚Äì Dr Fry. It is located above Adders. Current Head of House is Dr Andrew Harker. *Greenes, found along the Cloisters of the Grass Quad. The School's association with the Greene family is recognised in its name. Current Head of House is Max Stallard. *Loxwood, also found along the Cloisters. This house was named after a former girls' school house. Current Head of House is Martin Middleton. *Swifts, established at the same time as Bees. Current Head of House is Douglas Foster. *Tilman (formerly Incents), until September 2010, was both a boarding and day boy house. The boarding accommodation is situated along Chesham Road, and is the birthplace of Graham Greene. The House was named after John Incent, the School's founder and had its main entrance in the cloisters between Loxwood and Greenes. In September 2010, Incents day house closed and was renamed 'Tilman' and moved to a new location on the site of the old swimming pool, sharing the site with Cox's. The former Incents House was renovated into a study for the Headmaster and Deputy Head of Berkhamsted Boys. The boarding house remained unchanged. Current Head of House is Richard Mackay. That at least three of the eight Senior Boys' Houses appear to be named after various fauna was not always intentional. When Swifts and Bees were formed in 1897, they were to be called 'A' and 'B' respectively, but the former's first House Master considered this dull, naming his House 'Swifts'. 'Bees' is thus phonetic. 'Adders' may be wholly fortuitous; 'Reeves' and 'Hawks', now 6th Form Houses, add to the confusion. Richard Reeve was the School's first Headmaster; Hawks was named by the apparent \\"fauna tradition\\" in 1933. =Senior girls' houses= *Holme *New Stede *Old Stede *Russell *St David's *Stephenson, founded in 2017, Stephenson is named in honour of microbiologist and biochemist Marjory Stephenson. *Wolstenholme, founded in 2011, Wolstenholme is named after Sue Wolstenholme who was a school governor for 35 years. =Sixth form houses= *Ashby, named after the mother of John Incent's second wife, Katherine. *Burgh, pronounced 'Berg'. *Churchill, after Clementine Churchill, Baroness Spencer-Churchill and formerly girls' boarding accommodation. *Hawks, a former junior boys' house, established in 1934. *Nash, named after Henry Nash, a founder of Berkhamsted School for Girls. *Reeves, named after Richard Reeve and founded as a junior boys' house, along with Hawks. *St George's, originally a junior house for the \\"train boys\\", rather like Adders. *School, variously the Headmaster's quarters and a boarding house. *Spencer, a new sixth form house introduced in 2009. *Tudor, a new sixth form house introduced in 2019. History of Berkhamsted School, 1541‚Äì1996 =Founding= Dean Incent's House as it stands today on the Berkhamsted High StreetHigh Clergy of the 16th century frequently distinguished themselves by their furthering of the educational establishment and, in this respect, Berkhamsted owes much to John Incent. In 1523, he called upon the Brethren of the local Brotherhood of St John the Baptist to divert the funds they had hitherto donated to the monastic hospital (which had closed) to the Brotherhood House, about which little is known. In 1541, however, Incent applied to the King, Henry VIII, in pursuit of a licence \\"to purchase ¬£40 in land by the year,\\" and was successful. Although Incent was Berkhamsted's most famous descendant, it is considered an act of great piety that he chose to found a School outside what had become his Sphere of Influence. By 1544, Berkhamsted School's first building, now known as 'Old Hall' was complete, later to be described by William Camden as \\"the only structure in Berkhamsted worth a second glance.\\"as cited in Scott Hastie, Berkhamsted: An Illustrated History (Alpine Press), 120. The formal opening is recorded in the Ancient Documents: > When the building of the said Schoole was thus finished, the Deane sent for > the chiefe men of the Towne into the Schoole, where he kneeling downe, gave > thanks to Almighty God, which had given him life to see the perfection of > that work, which both he, the towne and the country had beene about for the > space of 20 years as is manifest by the pmisses. First he read his licence. > Then he called for Richd Reeve, and placed him in the seate there made for > the Schoolemr. and so did ordaine, make and pnounce him to be the first > Master of the said Schoole and after that tooke him by the hand and did give > him and his successors for ever possession of the lodgings appteining to > that office. In like manner he placed John Audley to be Usher , and John > East to be Chaplen. This done he did give possession by his deed bearing > date the 23 of March in the 36 yeare of Henry the 8 to the said Richd Reeve > John Audley and John East and their successours for ever, of all the land to > the sd Schoole then appointed, which are expressed pticularly in an act of > pliamt. made 2 & 3 Ed 6. Finally the Deane began TE DEUM LAUDAMUS which > being finished with certaine other praiers and ceremonies, the whole > Companie did there drink together and so depted.as cited in B.H. Garnons > Williams, A History of Berkhamsted School, 1541‚Äì1972 (Watson and Viney), > 20‚Äì21. Yet the legal foundation was not nearly so sound. When Incent died some 18 months later, his entire wealth (over ¬£330) became the King's, his documents stating that Berkhamsted's founder, a highly educated lawyer, had died intestate. The authenticity of this claim is rightly questioned: shortly after Incent's death, a complaint was made to the King \\"by some evill persons that the Deane had laid to the Schoole more revenues than his licence [¬£40 annually] did permitt him.\\" Furthermore, Henry VIII stood to gain ¬£196 and \\"a front of pearls\\" from the Dean's estate. However, there had been no formal incorporation of the School, and records suggest that Incent had spent much time since the opening preparing, but not realising, legal protection. An investigation into the claims that his annual endowment had been exceeded was commissioned and undertaken by John Waterhouse, a favourite not only of the King, but also a confidant of Incent, who had been present at the Opening. His choice of Commissioner suggests the Foundation still had Royal approval, something that had allowed the School to survive the first attack against it. The most enduring legacy of the Foundation nonetheless remains the building itself, \\"strong and fair\\". A view of Old Hall =A Delicate establishment= Incent's death, which itself had created a threat to the School, was followed by that of Henry VIII in January 1547. The Chantries Act 1546, which could have jeopardised the post of Chaplain at Berkhamsted, was replaced by new legislation, and the Foundation was declared \\"unperfect\\". A Foundation Act was introduced in parliament to settle the various claims to the Incent estate, but only those concerning the most immediate relatives of John. Thus claims to land of the School's endowment in Sparkford near Winchester were made and tried, resulting in significant loss to the School. An additional threat came when Edward VI, acting on advice, re-established the School under his own name. In reality, there was both initial benefit and ultimate disadvantage in this. Richard Reeve, the first Headmaster, held strict Protestant views, and was dismissed by the Bishop of Lincoln, acting upon Queen Mary's instructions, in 1555. He was replaced by William Barker, who no doubt offered an alternative religious policy, for he himself was removed when Elizabeth gained the throne. =Fulfillment under Saltmarsh and Hunt= William Saltmarsh enjoyed a longer Headmastership than either Reeve or Barker. The latter had appointed Leonard Stepney as Usher, but he lost his post in 1571 on charges of harbouring a Catholic priest. His successor, John Bristowe, had a still more colourful end, murdered gruesomely in 1597 by a local yeoman. Although this would no doubt have caused Saltmarsh concern, this was otherwise a most successful period in the history of Berkhamsted School. Pupil numbers continued to increase, and a handful of Berkhamstedians, as they would become known, achieved notoriety. By 1616, some years after Saltmarsh's death, it was written > Scholae Ludimagister cum 33 annos eidem praefuisset amplam pecuniam > testamento suo moriens legavit reficiendis his aedibuswhich Williams > translates: \\"William Saltmarsh, third Headmaster of this School, after > presiding over it for 33 years, on his deathbed bequeathed a sum of money > sufficient for the repair of this building.\\" Quite why the building (by which it is meant Old Hall) had fallen into disrepair under an otherwise successful Headmaster is uncertain, but through his donation Saltmarsh had decisively added himself to Berkhamsted's list of benefactors. All available evidence, of which there is admittedly little, suggests that the Hunt years were also successful ones for the School. His period in the office probably witnessed greater stability in the School than in his personal life ‚Äì he was married as many as four times ‚Äì and there was praise for his leadership, a former pupil recording \\"much reverence and affect\\" for Hunt. It also appears that he took as active a part in the life of Berkhamsted as had become and remains a tradition, serving as overseer for the poor and Bailiff as well as contributing to church funds. He died in office, aged 70, in 1636. =Shorter tenures= There were two hereditary Headmasterships in the history of Berkhamsted School, neither of which was successful. The first was that of Henry Hunt, a graduate of Trinity College, Oxford, who died within six months of succeeding his father; the second was to come in the 19th century. Hunt's successor, William Pitkin, was not quite the academic of former Berkhamsted days. Yet he was clearly a prominent member of local society, having served as Member of Parliament for Berkhamsted, and whose descendants included a member of the U.S. Supreme Court and Oliver Wolcott, a signatory of the Declaration of Independence. In England, however, the political environment began to take its toll on Berkhamsted. Berkhamsted, situated along a route between London and the battlefields of the English Civil War, became the subject of Parliamentary action to preserve the town. Pitkin's death is recorded in the parish register of Fleet Street, London in September 1643; in his history, Williams suggests Pitkin may have visited London in an attempt to obtain protection for the School, instead dying of the Plague. He was succeeded by Timothy Taylor, until then Usher, but the conditions of the period deny history any formal details, except that his death in 1648 was probably also a result of Plague. Ogle (1648‚Äì1651/2) witnessed local controversy resulting from the Civil War and it was likely that the School's seemingly relentless decline had begun in earnest by the time of his tenure, with student numbers falling from 80 to under 10 over three decades. Such was the confusion of the period that it is uncertain whether Peter Berkenhead ever even served as Headmaster, although the weight of evidence suggests that he did (however insignificantly). This series of less distinguished office-holders is no doubt attributable in part to the Civil War; further, since the value of money had for so long been falling, the annual pay, having been set at the Foundation, was insufficient for such a post by the end of the 17th century. =The Fossan saga= Thomas Fossan, a friend of Samuel Pepys, petitioned the King for the Berkhamsted job in December 1662. His motive in doing so is unclear, himself recognising that \\"by reason of its small salary\\" it was not highly sought, but mostly since, having realised his ambition, Fossan so neglected his duties. Indeed, such was the strength of feeling judges against Fossan that the very same people who had recommended him in 1662 wrote to the authorities six years later in the name of \\"the trust imposed in [them] by the founders of the schoole\\" that the Headmaster be removed. When the charges were put to him (that both he and his Usher had spent much time away from the School, that the boys' knowledge of grammar was minimal and that the townspeople had taken to lodging the scholars in light of the School's failure so to do), Fossan replied that \\"he cared not whether he had any scholars or not, for the fewer he had the less trouble he should have.\\" His forced resignation followed shortly after.Fossan's resignation was written in the most eloquent Latin and read during a ceremony in Old Hall. ='So Mean a School'= It is some indication of the extent of Berkhamsted's degeneration under Fossan that his successor, Edmund Newboult, was recommended by the Bishop of Hereford as \\"of parts sufficient for so mean a school,\\" an endorsement described as \\"comically unenthusiastic\\".Garnons Williams, p. 67 The most prominent historical source on Newboult remains a reply he made to an educational researcher some years into his tenure, noting that \\"Ye Statues of ye Schoole were made in ye time of popery, therefore not observed.\\" During his 17 years of office, Newboult does appear to have provided a solid educational environment at Berkhamsted, at least relatively speaking, something continued under his successor, Thomas Wren. In his wake came John Theed, member of a prosperous Buckinghamshire family, and Berkhamsted's longest serving Headmaster. Indeed, throughout the 18th century, there were to be only four occupants of the post, an age not only of stability but stagnation. Nonetheless, the three inspectionsIncent had invested this responsibility in the warden of All Souls College, Oxford, which he had attended. carried out during the three years found no cause for concern, and in their record is revealed the first reference to curriculum content, the boys having been examined on Ovid's Metamorphoses. Theed was the School's second pluralistA holder of more than one office simultaneously (it is no inspiration that the first was Fossan): his obituary in The Gentleman's Magazine recorded him as Vicar of Marsworth and made no mention of his Berkhamsted role ‚Äì some suggest this is characteristic of an insouciant, unambitious approach to the School. A similar charge could not be made against Evan Price. Having served as Usher for 16 of Theed's less proactive years, Price had become accustomed to the day-to-day running of the School. On Theed's death in 1734, his succession, still the jurisdiction of the Sovereign, brought Price to the Headmastership, despite his not having attended university and his flamboyant record ‚Äì as curate of Bovingdon, he had been involved in an \\"unseemly brawl\\" during a burial he was officiating.

Along with some two dozen similar incidents, the attack was manufactured by Germany as a casus belli to justify the invasion of Poland, which began the next morning. The attackers posed as Polish nationals. During his declaration of war, Hitler did not mention the Gleiwitz incident but grouped all provocations staged by the SS as an alleged Polish assault on Germany. The Gleiwitz incident is the best-known action of Operation Himmler, a series of special operations undertaken by the Schutzstaffel (SS) to serve Nazi German propaganda at the outbreak of war. The operation was intended to create the appearance of Polish aggression against Germany to justify the invasion of Poland. Evidence for the Gleiwitz attack by the SS was provided by the German SS officer, Alfred Naujocks in 1945. Events at Gleiwitz Much of what is known about the Gleiwitz incident comes from the affidavit of SS- Sturmbannf√ºhrer Alfred Naujocks at the Nuremberg Trials. In his testimony, he stated that he organised the incident under orders from Reinhard Heydrich and Heinrich M√ºller, chief of the Gestapo. On the night of 31 August, a small group of German operatives dressed in Polish uniforms and led by Naujocks seized the Gleiwitz station and broadcast a short anti-German message in Polish (sources vary on the content of the message). The operation was named \\"Grossmutter gestorben\\" (Grandmother died).The World War II's first victim. A farmer was murdered as part of a Nazi plot to provide an excuse to invade Poland, the story of a man forgotten by history. By Bob Graham, 29 Aug 2009. The Telegraph. The operation was to make the attack and the broadcast look like the work of Polish anti-German saboteurs. To make the attack seem more convincing, the Gestapo murdered Franciszek Honiok, a 43-year-old unmarried German Silesian Catholic farmer, known for sympathising with the Poles. He had been arrested the previous day by the Gestapo and dressed to look like a saboteur, then killed by lethal injection and given gunshot wounds. Honiok was left dead at the scene so that he appeared to have been killed while attacking the station. His corpse was then presented to the police and press as proof of the attack. Several prisoners from the Dachau concentration camp were drugged, shot dead on the site and their faces disfigured to make identification impossible.Thomas Laqueur, 'Devoted to Terror,' in London Review of Books, Vol. 37 No. 18‚Äì24 September 2015, pp. 9‚Äì16. The Germans referred to them by the code phrase \\"Konserve\\" (canned goods). Some sources incorrectly refer to the incident as Operation Canned Goods. In an oral testimony at the trials, Erwin von Lahousen stated that his division of the Abwehr was one of two that were given the task of providing Polish Army uniforms, equipment and identification cards; he was later told by Wilhelm Canaris that people from concentration camps had been disguised in these uniforms and ordered to attack the radio stations. In a historical plot twist, Oskar Schindler who later is credited with saving the lives of 1,200 Jews during the Holocaust, played a role in supplying the Polish uniforms and weapons used in the operation as an agent for the Abwehr. Context Plaque on site commemorating the incident The Gleiwitz incident was a part of a larger operation carried out by Abwehr and SS forces. Other orchestrated incidents were conducted along the Polish- German border at the same time as the Gleiwitz attack, such as a house burning in the Polish Corridor and spurious propaganda. The project was called Operation Himmler and comprised incidents giving the appearance of Polish aggression against Germany. German newspapers and politicians, including Adolf Hitler, had made accusations against Polish authorities for months before the 1939 invasion of organising or tolerating violent ethnic cleansing of ethnic Germans living in Poland. On 1 September, the day following the Gleiwitz attack, Germany launched Fall Weiss (Case White), the invasion of Poland, which precipitated World War II in Europe. Hitler cited the border incidents in a speech in the Reichstag on the same day, with three of them called very serious, as justification for his invasion of Poland. Hitler had told his generals on 22 August, \\"I will provide a propagandistic casus belli. Its credibility doesn't matter. The victor will not be asked whether he told the truth\\". International reactions American correspondents were summoned to the scene the next day but no neutral parties were allowed to investigate the incident in detail and the international public was skeptical of the German version of the incident. In popular culture There have been several adaptations of the incident in cinema. Der Fall Gleiwitz (1961), directed by Gerhard Klein for DEFA studios (The Gleiwitz Case; English subtitles), is an East German film that reconstructs the events. Operacja Himmler (1979) is a Polish film that covers the events.

The newspaper was founded in 1979 by the Socialist Campaign for a Labour Victory, later renamed the Socialist Organiser Alliance. The newspaper was originally a vehicle for united work between the International-Communist League (I-CL), the Workers' Socialist League (who merged with the ICL to become a new WSL), Workers Power and independent leftists, such as Ken Livingstone. Some independent Labour leftists split from the paper when it opposed the tactic of raising rates to offset cuts to local government services. In the mid-1980s, the paper was sued by the Workers Revolutionary Party over claims they repeated that the WRP was partially funded by money from the Libyan and Iraqi governments, but the WRP abandoned the action. The newspaper gradually became more identified with the new WSL. This process was completed when the ICL/WSL fusion broke, as Socialist Organiser re-evaluated many of its international policies and developed its own distinctive \\"third camp\\" position. As Socialist Organiser lost ground as a broad vehicle of left unity in the Labour Party, Sean Matgamna's supporters from the former ICL began to work entirely through the Socialist Organiser Alliance. Socialist Organiser was denied the right to register with the Labour Party in 1990, but this had little practical effect and it continued to be published until the mid-1990s, when the Alliance for Workers' Liberty and International Socialist Group supported the launch of a new newspaper, Action for Solidarity.

The game is played by filling a tub or a large basin with water and putting apples in the water. Because apples are less dense than water, they will float at the surface.

Overview The interior of typical European couchette compartment, with the beds folded down to the night-time configuration. Map of European night trains carrying sleeper and/or couchette cars. The car is divided into a number of compartments (typically 8 to 10) accessed from the side corridor of the car, which in daytime are configured with a bench seat along each long side of the compartment. At an appropriate time in the journey, the attendant who travels in the car (or by agreement the passengers booked in the compartment) converts the compartment into its night-time configuration with two (1st class) or three (2nd class) bunks on each long side of the compartment, creating a total of four bunks in first class and six in second class. Typically, in 2nd class the seat serves as the lowest bunk, and the back of the seat is turned into a horizontal position and serves as the middle bunk. There are two types of couchette car in countries of the former USSR: \\"coup√©\\" and \\"platzkart\\". \\"Coup√©\\" cars are more expensive and comfortable with 4-bunk compartments fully separated from each other and the corridor. The cheaper \\"Platzkart\\" cars, use a somewhat different layout, with no wall between compartment and corridor, only four bunks along the long sides of the compartment, and two more mounted on the corridor wall, the lower bunk folding in the daytime to become two seats. The attendant provides a sheet, blanket, and pillow for each passenger. Unlike in sleeping cars, couchette compartments are not always segregated by sex, and it is normal not to undress except for removing footwear. One compartment at the end of the car is reserved for the use of the attendant (who may supervise two adjacent cars), who will sell (if not included in the fare) hot and cold drinks and continental breakfasts in the morning. In western Europe the attendant will take charge of passengers' tickets and passports at the start of the journey, returning them before arrival at the destination, thus ensuring that passengers are not disturbed by ticket and passport inspections. In some former eastern bloc countries this is not done, and it is normal for passengers to be awoken by border police and railway inspectors at each border crossing. Toilets and washrooms are located at the ends of the car. Couchette cars have not been as popular in Britain (except on the Royal Train, presumably as staff accommodation); as they have been in continental Europe, although a number of sleeper trains can trace their history back to as early as the 1870s. It was normal practice, nevertheless, for British passengers to join long-distance overnight trains at Calais, Boulogne, Oostende or Hoek van Holland after crossing the English Channel or North Sea by ferry. There has been a substantial decline in the number of long-distance overnight train services since the mid-1990s, caused by the increase in the number of high- speed daytime services, and competition from low-cost airlines. Environmental organizations are trying to make night trains more attractive again, as a more climate-friendly alternative to short-haul flights.

Common methods of conversing including meeting in person, conducting conference calls, using text messaging, or using a website such as an Internet forum. People respond, add comments, and make posts on such forums, as well as on established mailing lists, in news groups, or in IRC channels. Other group members could choose to respond by posting text or image. Brief history Discussion group was evolved from USENET which is a traced back to early 80's. Two computer scientists Jim Ellis and Tom Truscott founded the idea of setting a system of rules to produce \\"articles\\", and then send back to their parallel news group. Fundamentally, the form of discussion group was generated on the concept of USENET, which emphasised ways of communication via email and web forums. Gradually, USENET had developed to be a system of channels which provide notifications and \\"articles\\" to meet general public's needs. Nowadays, World Wide Web gradually takes on the major role of supporting and extending platforms for discussion group on the Internet by setting up various web servers. Overview of popular online discussion group systems =Google Groups= Google Groups has become one of the major online discussion groups, with a wide range of worldwide frequent users. Features include: * the ability for anyone to create new groups and join existing groups. * the ability to search for groups that focus on specific subject matter, as well as advanced search features that allow the search results to be filtered by date, language, and post author, among others. * three levels of group participation: public, announcements only, and restricted. =Facebook groups= Facebook groups simplify processes and protect the privacy of users when they interact with people. Users can create a group and delegate admins. Group admins are able to make a range of adjustments to the group page, such as changing its cover photo, moderating posts and comments, and pinning posts so that the permanently appear at the top of the group page. Admins can also create group events, news updates and manage group members. By default, groups are public, and anyone can join them at the discretion of that group's admins. However, groups may be marked as private ‚Äî a user may only join such a group if an existing member sends them an invitation. A single user is capable of joining a maximum of 6000 groups. =WhatsApp groups= WhatsApp is a mobile messaging app with group discussion features. Users can create group chats to facilitate group discussions. By default, all group members are admins of that group, but this may be changed at the discretion of any existing admin. Admins have the ability to rename the group, add and remove members, and delete messages that have been sent to the group. Advantages *Advantages: the implementation of Google Groups comes with its own advantages. For diverse users, it provides the service of interpreting languages widely, which helps present a better way to communicate effectively with people in different countries. Considering of storage, one group member enjoys \\"100 megabytes (MB)\\" while there are no restrictions for the whole group. It delivers convenience for group members work on projects that need considerably more storage than normal files, for example, presentations. Studies conducted by Kushin and Kitchener indicates Facebook provide users in discussion groups with more opportunities to post content that has correlation with \\"social, political, or sporting issues\\". For Whatsapp users, the communication service brings enjoyment to share ideas with comparatively low cost. Ideally, it enhanced the quality of communication regarding of its records saving, security and trustability. *Information in Discussion groups are usually archived. For example, Google's Groups (formerly DejaNews) is an archive of Usenet articles trace back to 1981. Discussion group archives are sometimes an effective way to find an answer to very ambiguous questions.  Academic *Small group of professionals or students formally or informally negotiate about an academic topic within certain fields. This implementation could be seen as an investigation or research based on various academic levels. For instance, \\"one hundred eighty college- level psychology students\\" breakdown into different groups to participate in giving an orderly arrangement of preferred events. Nevertheless, discussion groups could support professional services and hold events to a range of demographics; another distinguished example is from \\"The London Biological Mass Spectrometry Discussion Group\\", which sustainably operates by gathering \\"technicians, clinicians, academics, industrialists and students\\" to exchange ideas on an academic level. It attributes to the development of participants' cognitive, critical thinking, and analytical skills.

A beachhead is a temporary line created when a military unit reaches a landing beach by sea and begins to defend the area while other reinforcements help out until a unit large enough to begin advancing has arrived. The term is sometimes used interchangeably (both correctly and incorrectly) with bridgehead and lodgement. Beachheads were very important in operations such as Operation Neptune during World War II, the Korean War (especially at Inchon), and the Vietnam War, among many other examples. Although many references state that Operation Neptune refers to the naval operations in support of Operation Overlord, the most reliable references make it clear that Overlord refers to the establishment of a large-scale lodgement in Normandy, and that Neptune refers to the landing phase which created the beachhead; i.e. Neptune was the first part of Overlord. According to the D-Day Museum: Once an amphibious assault starts, victory tends to go to the side which can reinforce the beachhead most quickly. There are exceptions to this rule where the amphibious forces have not expanded from their beachheads quickly enough to create a lodgement area before the defenders can reinforce their positions. Two famous examples in which the attackers failed to expand their beachheads before the defending side could bring up reinforcements occurred during the landing at Suvla Bay in the Gallipoli Campaign in World War I and the amphibious landing at Anzio (in Operation Shingle) during the Italian Campaign of World War II.

United States is a set of court cases brought by Daniel J. Bernstein challenging restrictions on the export of cryptography from the United States. History The case was first brought in 1995, when Bernstein was a student at University of California, Berkeley, and wanted to publish a paper and associated source code on his Snuffle encryption system. Bernstein was represented by the Electronic Frontier Foundation, who hired outside lawyer Cindy Cohn and also obtained pro bono publico assistance from Lee Tien of Berkeley; M. Edward Ross of the San Francisco law firm of Steefel, Levitt & Weiss; James Wheaton and Elizabeth Pritzker of the First Amendment Project in Oakland; and Robert Corn-Revere, Julia Kogan, and Jeremy Miller of the Washington, DC, law firm of Hogan & Hartson. After four years and one regulatory change, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that software source code was speech protected by the First Amendment and that the government's regulations preventing its publication were unconstitutional. Regarding those regulations, the EFF states: The government requested en banc review. In Bernstein v. U.S. Dept. of Justice, 192 F.3d 1308 (9th Cir. 1999), the Ninth Circuit ordered that this case be reheard by the en banc court, and withdrew the three-judge panel opinion, Bernstein v. U.S. Dept. of Justice, 176 F.3d 1132 (9th Cir.1999). The government modified the regulations again, substantially loosening them, and Bernstein, now a professor at the University of Illinois at Chicago, challenged them again. This time, he chose to represent himself, although he had no formal legal training. On October 15, 2003, almost nine years after Bernstein first brought the case, the judge dismissed it and asked Bernstein to come back when the government made a \\"concrete threat\\".

Originally slated to have been a one-time only character on the show, he soon broke out to be its most popular character and gradually became its main protagonist. Due to the Urkel character's off-putting characteristics and the way he is written to stir up events and underscore the plot or even move it along, he is considered a nuisance by the original protagonist's family, the Winslows, though they come to accept him over time. The character is the epitome of a geek or nerd of the era, due to traits such as large, thick eyeglasses, flood pants held up by suspenders, multi-colored cardigan sweaters, saddle shoes, and a high-pitched voice. He professes love for his neighbor Laura Winslow, who is a character in the main family of the series, but this love of his is written as an accent on or trigger for events and crises, and is therefore very unrequited. From the Urkel character's debut through the rest of the series' run, he is central to many of its running gags, primarily property damage and/or personal injury as a result of his inventions going awry or his outright clumsiness. He becomes known by viewers and characters alike for several catchphrases uttered after some humorous misfortune occurs, including \\"I've fallen and I can't get up!\\", \\"I don't have to take this. I'm going home.\\" \\"Did I do that?\\" \\"Whoa, Mama!\\" and \\"Look what you did!\\" (on occasions when someone else caused the damage, though usually the accident was indirectly caused by Urkel).  Character development  In syndication, Steve Urkel first appeared on the 4th episode of the first season, \\"Rachel's First Date\\" (as the show staff wanted to more naturally introduce him to audiences upon repeated viewings). On the 12th episode of the first season, \\"Laura's First Date\\", he reappears as a nerdy young boy who takes Laura Winslow out on a date. While he is madly in love with her, Laura finds Steve grating and doesn't return his affection. While intended as a minor character, Urkel became very popular for his oddball antics. He soon became a recurring character, and joined the main cast beginning with the season two premiere \\"Rachel's Place\\". Family Matters co- creator Michael Warren named the character after his friend, writer and director Steve Erkel. Due to the show and the character's tremendous popularity during the early 1990s, Erkel encountered difficulties using his own name; he received many prank phone calls from \\"Laura\\" asking for \\"Steve\\", and businesses found his name to be suspicious. Warren stated that had he known that the character would reappear for years he would not have named him after his friend. = Portrayal = An archetypal nerd, Steve Urkel is characterized as kind and well-meaning, but bungling and a meddler. He is fiercely protective of and obsessed with his unrequited love Laura Winslow, and this admiration extends to the rest of the Winslow family. However, Steve is comically clumsy and inept and his attempts to help the Winslows usually go awry. This puts him at odds with the family patriarch Carl, who routinely throws Urkel out of his house. He has shown to take responsibility for his own mistakes and reimburses the Winslows for the damages he's done. Steve is close to Mother Winslow who is delighted each time he comes over much to Carl's chagrin Later episodes suggest that Steve's attachment to the Winslows stems from his bad relationship with his own family. Urkel often hints that most of his relatives, including his (unseen) parents, despise him and refuse to associate with him. This culminates in the two moving to Russia without him, whereupon he moves in with the Winslows. The show has also revealed that Steve at least has four relatives who care about him in Uncle Ernie who owns a horse trailer, Uncle Cecil who despite his gambling problems come over to the Urkel home to keep an eye on him, Aunt Oona from Altoona whom is like a mother to him and Myrtle. Urkel dresses unfashionably for someone his age (he is most commonly seen wearing suspenders, brightly colored shirts, and high water pants) and has a number of eccentric hobbies and interests, including polka dancing and accordion playing. His motor vehicle of choice is the small three- wheeled Isetta. Unlike his friends, he has little interest in popular culture and athletic endeavors. This has caused Myra to be attracted to Urkel herself due to them not being interested in pop culture. While he is unpopular with his schoolmates, Urkel is a brilliant student and is on a first-name basis with his teachers. He is a genius inventor as well, and his fantastical but unreliable gadgets (including a transformation device and a time machine) are central to many Family Matters plots and gags. Urkel also has an adept sense of lawbreaking which involves peer pressure. This has been explored four times, mainly with Eddie since he often has to learn his lesson the hard way when he finds himself in situations outside his control. = Stefan Urquelle = White as Steve's suave alter-ego Stefan Urquelle. During the season five episode \\"Dr. Urkel and Mr. Cool\\", in a takeoff on The Nutty Professor films, Urkel devises a plan to win Laura's heart: transforming his DNA using a serum, which suppresses his \\"nerd genes\\" and brings out his \\"cool\\" genes. This results in the alter ego known as Stefan Urquelle, played by Jaleel White in more casual attire. Initially, Laura is enamored with the smoother Stefan, but asks that he turn back into Steve when Stefan's self-centeredness makes itself apparent. Steve improves the formula in the season five episode \\"Stefan Returns\\" to reduce its negative effects on his personality, and invents a \\"transformation chamber\\" allowing him to become Stefan at will. He would change into Stefan several times ‚Äì even while dating Myra ‚Äì but some circumstance would force Steve to turn into his normal self again. With his narcissistic tendencies toned down, Laura falls deeply in love with Steve's alter-ego. In the seventh-season finale \\"Send in the Clones\\", Steve creates a cloning machine and winds up creating a perfect duplicate of himself. Myra is initially excited, but eventually realizes that two Steves are just too much. To clear up the situation, Laura proposes that one of the Steves be permanently turned into Stefan, so that she and Myra can both be with the one they love. This Stefan becomes a recurring character and eventually proposes to Laura in the ninth season. After weighing her choices in the episode \\"Pop Goes the Question\\", Laura chooses Steve over Stefan. Stefan departs and is not seen again. Cultural impact In 2010, Westside Middle School in Memphis, Tennessee outlined its dress code policy on sagging pants, asking students to pull them up or get \\"Urkeled\\", a reference to the character. In this practice, teachers would forcibly pull students' pants up and attach them to their waist using zip ties. Students would also have their photo taken and posted on a board in the hallway, for all of their classmates to view. In an interview with NBC affiliate WMC-TV, Principal Bobby White stated that the general idea is to fight pop culture with pop culture. One teacher at the school claimed to have \\"Urkeled\\" up to 80 students per week, although after five weeks the number dropped to 18. = Ratings effect = In syndication, Steve is incorporated into the teaser scene of \\"Rachel's First Date\\"; his first appearance in the original broadcasts is in the 1989 episode \\"Laura's First Date\\", in which Carl and Eddie separately set up dates for Laura for a dance or party (both terms are used in the episode), and the first thing known about him is that he allegedly ate a mouse, and he later makes reference to a mouse when speaking to Carl, implying that it might be true. Prior to Steve Urkel's introduction, the show was on the brink of cancellation due to mediocre ratings. After Urkel was introduced, several scripts had to be hastily rewritten to accommodate the character, while several first-season episodes that had been completed had new opening gag sequences filmed featuring Steve trying to push open the Winslows' front door while the family holds it shut. The addition of Steve immediately helped the show boost its modest ratings. White was credited as a guest star in the first season and became a regular member of the cast in season two. Jo Marie Payton, who played Harriette Winslow, admitted that she felt the Urkel character had hogged much of the show's attention and disrupted the close family relationship she had formed with the rest of the cast. She experienced increasing burnout over the course of the show and felt that the overbearing focus on Urkel had made the show jump the shark; she very nearly quit when the show moved to CBS but agreed to stay for the first several episodes while a new actress, Judyann Elder, was cast as Harriet. White is one of the few living members of the cast with whom Payton no longer speaks regularly. She nevertheless speaks well of her experiences and appreciates the effect that the Urkel had on the show's popularity and thus the residuals everyone receives from the show. Reginald VelJohnson also discussed the focus on Urkel but was much less negative about it than Payton, stating bluntly that all of the cast benefited from the massive success of the show in relation to the fans' love for Steve Urkel, and that he never felt short-changed by this process. = The Urkel Dance = The Urkel Dance was a novelty dance that originated in the season two episode \\"Life of the Party\\". It was based around the character of Steve Urkel and essentially incorporated movements which made the dancer's posture more like his. The dance was popular enough to appear on another show, Step by Step, when the Steve Urkel character appeared in a crossover in the season one episode \\"The Dance\\". Jaleel White also performed the song, in character as Steve Urkel, on the 5th Annual American Comedy Awards. Bea Arthur (from Maude & The Golden Girls) joined him on stage to \\"Do The Urkel,Do The Urkel(.com) \\\\- The Website\\" after which she said, \\"Hey MC Hammer, try and touch that!\\"The House of Diabolique vs. Bea Arthur & Urkel A promotional cassette single of the song that accompanies the dance was produced and distributed in limited numbers. A T-shirt was also produced featuring lyrics and Urkel's likeness. Rick Sanchez pays some form of homage to The Urkel Dance with \\"The Rick Dance\\" in the Rick and Morty episode Ricksy Business. = Appearances on other shows = * Full House ‚Äì In the 1991 episode, \\"Stephanie Gets Framed\\", Steve is called in to help Stephanie Tanner (Jodie Sweetin) deal with her anxieties after she has to get glasses. He was cousin to a friend of D. J.. He also jams with Uncle Jesse and gives Michelle a penny for her piggy bank, telling her that \\"with prevailing interest rates, that penny will be worth three cents by the turn of the century\\". Incidentally, Family Matters did not air on the night of the episode's original airdate (January 25, 1991). It is implied that he found himself in San Francisco in the Full House universe before paying a visit to the Lambert household from Step by Step. * Step by Step ‚Äì In the series' second episode, \\"The Dance\\", Steve lands in the Lambert-Foster family's backyard after launching himself with a rocket pack from the living room of the Winslows' house in the Family Matters episode \\"Brain Over Brawn\\" (the two scenes being shown in uninterrupted sequence, as Family Matters and Step by Step aired back to back on ABC's TGIF lineup at the time). He then helps his science-fair pen pal, Mark Foster (Christopher Castile), and lifts Alicia \\"Al\\" Lambert (Christine Lakin)'s spirits after her potential date dumps her just before a school dance. White reprises his \\"Do the Urkel\\" dance in the scene where Al gives the boy that dumped her his comeuppance. White also makes a brief two-second cameo as Steve in the 1997 episode \\"A Star Is Born\\", snapping a clapperboard on the set of the movie that Al was cast in over her two sisters. ** Additionally, in the Family Matters episode \\"Beauty and the Beast\\", Steve sends a chain letter to his friend Cory Matthews, who lived in Philadelphia. The reference is to Ben Savage's character from Boy Meets World, but there were no on-screen crossovers. In an episode of Boy Meets World, Cory says he receives a chain letter from his friend Steve. * Fuller House - In the Season 3 finale, Urkel was mentioned by D.J.. In a January 2018 interview with TVLine‚Äôs Andy Swift, series creator and former showrunner Jeff Franklin mentioned that they have talked about White reprising the role and that they had some ideas for the character if White decides to reprise the role. * Scooby-Doo and Guess Who? - White reprised his role on the animated series Scooby-Doo and Guess Who? in the episode \\"When Urkel-Bots Go Bad!\\". = Merchandise = At the height of his popularity, Urkel's name was branded to several products including a short-lived fruit flavored cereal known as Urkel- Os and a Steve Urkel pullstring doll, which were both released in 1991. There was also a T-shirt line that was created in 2002, but was discontinued shortly after its inception. Reception In 1999, TV Guide ranked Urkel #27 on its list of the \\"50 Greatest TV Characters of All Time\\". In 2004, he was listed at #98 in Bravo's 100 Greatest TV Characters.

Hoyles was the first premier of Newfoundland to have been born in the colony, and served from 1861 to 1865. Born in St. John's, he was the son of Newman Hoyles, the first leader of the Tory Party. Educated in Nova Scotia Hoyles trained as a lawyer and returned to St John's in 1842, quickly establishing a large and lucrative legal practice. He was eminent in the Natives' Society and the Newfoundland Church Society. Hoyles was elected to the Assembly in 1848. He rapidly became the Conservative leader, opposing responsible government, on the grounds that the colony was not ready for it, and throwing his weight behind Bishop Feild's campaign to divide the Protestant educational grant and put Anglicans on the same footing as Catholics. This proposal alienated Methodists who thereupon voted for the Catholic Liberal Party so that, in the 1855 election, the first after responsible government, Hoyles found himself leader of the Opposition. Even though he dropped his support for Feild, and adopted a more pan-Protestant stance, he still unsuccessful in the election of 1859. In 1861, his chance came when he was hired as a lawyer by senior judges to fight Premier John Kent's plans to reduce their salaries. When Kent accused the judges, the governor and the Conservatives of conspiracy the Governor fired Kent and appointed Hoyles as the new Premier. Hoyles' government was defeated in the legislature and had to fight an election in a highly charged sectarian atmosphere which resulted in riots and loss of life, requiring troops to be sent in, when the Conservatives narrowly won the election. During his term as premier, he tried to cool sectarian tensions between Catholics and Protestants by inviting Catholics to join his administration and distributing all patronage fairly between religious groups. He sent delegates to the Canadian Confederation Conference at Quebec in 1864. Newfoundland had not been invited to Charlottetown. Those delegates, Ambrose Shea for the opposition, and Frederick Carter, for the government, did not have the power to negotiate. Hoyles decided to leave office in 1865, before the crucial 1869 election which decided the fate of Confederation with Canada. He was succeeded by Sir Frederick Carter. Hoyles was appointed Chief Justice of Newfoundland, a post which he filled with great distinction. He retired to Halifax in 1880 to live with his married daughter. He died on February 1, 1888. D.W. Prowse, the nineteenth century Newfoundland historian, comments that \\"we are all proud of Sir Hugh as the most distinguished Newfoundlander of our day\\". Family Lady Jean Hoyles Hoyles married Jean Liddell (1813-1886), daughter of John Liddell, in 1842. The couple had four children. Hoyles' wife, Jean, died on January 17, 1886, and was buried at Halifax, Nova Scotia. Their son, N. W. Hoyles, Esquire, K.C., lived in Toronto, Ontario.

Flynn became bored with acting, and he went to Africa in late 1964 to try his hand at being a guide for safaris and big-game hunting. He also spent time as a game warden in Kenya. In the latter part of 1965, Flynn needed money, so he made two Spaghetti Westerns in Spain and Italy that were released in 1966: Sette Magnifiche Pistole (Seven Guns for Timothy) and Dos Pistolas Gemelas co-starring the Spanish twin performers Pili and Mili. In the summer of 1966, Flynn went to Singapore to star in his eighth and final film, the French‚ÄìItalian action film Cinq Gars Pour Singapour (1967; released in 1968 as Five Ashore in Singapore).

Flynn's photos were soon published around the world. He made a name for himself as one of a group of high-risk photojournalists which included Dana Stone, Tim Page, Henri Huet, John Steinbeck IV, Perry Deane Young, Nik Wheeler, and Chas Gerretsen, who would do anything to get the best pictures, even go into combat. In March 1966, Flynn was wounded in the knee while in the field. In April, Flynn was on patrol with some Green Berets and Nung mercenaries when they were ambushed by the Viet Cong. Flynn was carrying an M-16 rifle at the time and had to fight his way out along with the other soldiers. \\"I thought not only me but all of us were greased.\\" Flynn had been given the rifle by the Green Berets and been under fire with them before.\\"Flynn's son baffles out of Red trap\\" (1966, Apr 27).

Disappearance On April 6, 1970, Flynn and a group of journalists left Phnom Penh to attend a government sponsored press conference in Saigon. Flynn (who was freelancing) and fellow photojournalist Dana Stone (who was on assignment for CBS) chose to travel on motorcycles instead of the limousines that the majority of the other journalists were traveling in. Reporter Steve Bell, who was one of the last Westerners to see the two alive, later said that after the press conference, Flynn and Stone had got word that there was a checkpoint on Highway 1 manned by members of the Viet Cong. Eager to get a photograph of the Viet Cong, Flynn and Stone decided to set out on Highway 1 alone. Before they left, Bell snapped the last known photo taken of Flynn and Stone.

She was voiced in both productions by Tracy Grandstaff. In 2002, Daria placed at number 41 on the list of the Top 50 Greatest Cartoon Characters of All Time by TV Guide for her role in the two shows.\\"TV Guide's 50 Greatest Cartoon Characters of All Time \\", CNN, July 30, 2002. Retrieved on October 29, 2009 She was also listed in AOL's 100 Most Memorable Female TV Characters. Conception and development Mike Judge created the Daria character on advice of the network. MTV senior vice president and creative director Abby Terkuhle explained that when Beavis and Butt-Head \\"became successful, we... created Daria's character because we wanted a smart female who could serve as the foil.\\" Terkuhle said that he added Daria \\"to put Beavis and Butt-Head in their place\\". Judge says that Daria named for a girl he knew in school who, like the character, was saddled with the nickname \\"Diarrhea\\". Glenn Eichler, who created the Daria spin-off - sometimes incorrectly stated to be the character's creator as well- was, along with Peggy Nicoll, one of the main writers of the series; other writers were Neena Beber, Anne D. Bernstein, Rachelle Romberg, Rachel Lipman, and Sam Johnson. https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0118298/?ref_=nm_knf_t3  In Beavis and Butt-Head  In Daria's first incarnation as a recurring character on Beavis and Butt-Head, she formed an intelligent female foil to the two main characters. She went through three different outfits, had a stockier figure, and initially was a more expressive character; her iconic monotone voice developed over time. While she later became more sardonic, she showed early on that she could hold her own against the two and could react quickly to their antics. In her debut episode, \\"Scientific Stuff\\", she was forced to do a science class presentation with Beavis and Butt-head and turned it to her advantage by using them as the presentation's experiment. She had a minor role in her next two appearances, in \\"Babes R Us\\" and \\"Sign Here\\". In \\"Sign Here\\" she answered questions from David Van Driessen on furriers and their treatment of animals. In later appearances, she alternated between being irritated by their antics and finding their stupidity to be amusing: in \\"Sprout\\", she specifically came over to watch them fail at planting seeds, and in \\"Walkathon\\" she got them to unwittingly pledge $100 apiece on a charity walkathon. In \\"Sporting Goods\\" she gave three eye-popping gasps while Beavis and Butt-head wear eye patches as athletic supporters, which is a dramatic contrast to her monotonous behavior in the later series. She lacked the passionate hatred for them that Principal McVicker and Coach Buzzcut had and was one of the very few characters that would willingly seek them out, but did not really believe there is any hope for them either, as Van Driessen had. On multiple occasions, she took it upon herself to explain simple concepts to them, such as informing them in \\"U.S. History\\" what graduation was (Beavis responded, \\"You mean, like... school ends?\\") and in \\"Sprout\\" that you put seeds in the ground. In a Christmas special, it is stated that Butt-Head had been responsible for giving her a negative outlook on boys. Aside from that, she was one of the few characters that the duo never managed to drive crazy as they had with many other students and teachers. Butt-Head sometimes treated her with some degree of respect, following her advice in \\"Sprout\\" and chuckling \\"Daria's cool!\\" after she asked Bill Clinton if \\"you were just jerking us around\\" on a campaign promise. John J. O'Connor of The New York Times describes Daria as \\"as sharp as B. & B. are dimwitted\\". John Allemang of The Globe and Mail described Daria in Beavis and Butt-Head \\"the prematurely wise girl who could be counted on to put their idiocy in perspective.\\" Beavis and Butt-Head often call her \\"Diarrhea\\". In the final episode of season 7, when the boys were believed dead, Daria expressed the sentiments that \\"I guess it's sad they're dead\\", but they did not have very bright futures to look forward to. Daria appeared frequently in the Marvel Comics adaptation of the TV show, and also got to appear on the cover of one issue and \\"answer\\" the fan mail in two others.\\"Daria on Beavis and Butt-head\\", Outpost-Daria.com In Beavis and Butt-Head Do America, she appears once throughout the film with a group of students, but does not have any dialogue. Daria's own show never mentioned Beavis and Butt-Head and named Highland only once at the beginning of the first episode of season one, carried over from the original and unbroadcast pilot. Despite this, it was frequently noted in media articles about the show that it was a spin-off from Beavis and Butt-Head. In an \\"interview\\" on CBS Early Show on January 21, 2002, Daria was asked by Jane Clayson if she kept in touch with Beavis and Butt-Head; she responded \\"I'd like to, but first they'd have to figure out that when the telephone makes that funny sound, you're supposed to pick it up and say hello\\".Transcript of CBS Daily Show \\"interview\\", Outpost-Daria.com As revealed in a Rolling Stone interview with Mike Judge, Daria would not return to the new episodes of Beavis and Butt-Head in 2011, but she was referenced in \\"Drones\\" during a music video when Beavis assumed she had committed suicide. However, Butt-Head incredulously tells his friend \\"What are you talking about, Beavis? Daria didn't die, she just moved away\\". In Daria In the series Daria which followed Beavis and Butt-head, Daria remains bespectacled and plain. She is an unfashionably dressed, highly intellectual, entirely pessimistic about life altogether, cynical/Diogenean, and sarcastic teenage girl who is portrayed as an icon of sanity in an insane household in an equally insane upper middle class suburb. She resides with her vacuous, fashion-obsessed younger sister Quinn and career-obsessed parents Helen and Jake. John Allemang of The Globe and Mail said that Daria is \\"both the disappointment of her overachieving parents and an embarrassment to her boy-crazy sister Quinn\\". She had moved to a new school, having transferred from the one in Beavis and Butt-Head. Glenn Eichler said, in relation to Daria the series, of which he was a co-creator, \\"I like to think that I've helped her come out of her shell.\\" David L. Coddon of the San Diego Union-Tribune described Daria as \\"the anti-cheerleader, the un-social climber, the jaundiced eye in a cartoon world of too much makeup and superficial crayon colors\\". Coddon added that Daria \\"may look like a misfit, but the catch is that Daria's the only character on the show who 'gets it'. It's everyone else who's a misfit.\\" Daria states in the first episode that she does not have low self esteem: she has low esteem for everybody else. Anita Gates of The New York Times said \\"The secret of Daria's popularity (everywhere but in her own home and school) may be our collective alienation.\\" Gates says \\"her tastes are a little dark.\\" As an example, Gates used the fact that she reads \\"Howl\\" by Allen Ginsberg at a reading to the elderly program. Eichler said, \\"Apparently everyone, with the exception of a very few people who were hit on the head when they were very young, felt like they were outsiders. You either identify with her as an outsider or you sort of envy her ability to navigate her life as an outsider and stay sane.\\" John J. O'Connor, a television critic for The New York Times, said \\"In short, Daria is the perfect anti-Barbie Doll. Merchants of fashion and cosmetics are beneath her contempt. Her refusal to be Miss Goody Consumer borders on the truly subversive.\\" He concludes that Daria \\"is every glorious misfit I ever knew\\". Allemang said that in Daria, Daria \\"seems more tortured and neurotic, if only because it's more clear that the airheads have won\\". Daria often talks to herself. Allemang adds \\"in a perky-teen world with its twisted values, soliloquies are the best hope of intelligent conversation.\\" In addition he said \\"There's nothing intrinsically wrong with Daria, just because she can't or won't hang out with the cool kids.\\" John J. O'Connor of The New York Times said that Daria has \\"a withering eye\\" towards her classmates. Emily Nussbaum for Slate would praise the show both for having a character that many disaffected teenagers could relate to and for showing \\"the flipside of her principled withdrawal from the world: her crippling terror of rejection, a streak of ugly self- righteousness\\". Daria likes to watch the fictitious television show Sick, Sad World. Gates added that \\"Daria is the kind of girl who reads Heart of Darkness and Edgar Allan Poe's 'Telltale Heart' in class.\\" =Relationships with other characters= Anita Gates of The New York Times says \\"The Morgendorffers don't even seem to notice that Daria constantly gives them lip.\\" In one scene, when Helen, her mother, says, \\"There's no course that can teach you to be a perfect mother,\\" Daria responds \\"That's obvious.\\" Gates says that \\"nobody sends her to her room\\". Gates also said that Daria's popular, self-absorbed sister Quinn is \\"the greatest burden on the home front\\". Jane Lane, Daria's best friend, met her at a self-esteem class. Gates adds that Jane \\"knows all of Daria's peculiarities and still loves her\\". Gates said that Daria's \\"silent intense crush\\" on Jane's brother Trent is her \\"only discernible weakness\\" and that \\"the absolute proof that Jane is a good friend is that she knows how Daria feels about Trent and will never, ever tell.\\" In spite of her early infatuation with Trent, Daria's most significant romantic relationship is with Tom Sloane, who entered the show at the end of the third season and rapidly became Jane's love interest before beginning a relationship with Daria that continued throughout the rest of the show and caused some friction between Daria and Jane. =Movies= The first Daria movie, Is It Fall Yet?, gave the principal characters time apart from one another in parallel narratives which foreshadowed further changes in their relationships. By the time of the finale movie Is It College Yet?, Daria's character has undergone noticeable growth. She chooses to attend Raft College. She graduates from Lawndale High, winning the Dian Fossey Award \\"for dazzling academic achievements in face of near total misanthropy\\", and crowning her acceptance speech with the assertion that \\"there is no aspect, no facet, no moment of life that can't be improved with pizza\\". Appearance Daria wears rounded thick glasses, an orange T-shirt underneath a green jacket, a black skirt, and black boots. John Allemang of The Globe and Mail said \\"to surrender is to be normal, to sacrifice your brain in the rush to be popular and wear uncomfortable shoes that make your legs look hot. Daria, as always, keeps her integrity. She wears sensible shoes, and finds her intellectual reward in not being hot.\\" In Beavis and Butt-Head, Daria wears square glasses, a leather jacket, white T-shirt, a red skirt, black leggings and black boots. In the earlier episodes, she is seen wearing a brown jacket, beige skirt, green shirt and brown boots. MTV \\"host\\" During her run on MTV, Daria would narrate or \\"host\\" special events and shows, either with a real-life presenter or with Jane. She was part of the Cool Crap Auction in 1999, giving an overview of the goods for auction and talking \\"live\\" to the winner of one prize, answering machine messages recorded by her.Cool Crap Auction transcript Daria and Jane also hosted MTV's Top Ten Animated Videos Countdown and two Daria Day marathons of their episodes; the Countdown and second marathon segments are included on the 2010 DVD release. Cameos Daria makes a brief cameo in the Drawn Together episode \\"Lost in Parking Space, Part Two\\". She is being tortured in the basement of a Hot Topic along with other cartoon characters. She has a nail being hammered into her eye and says, \\"This is men's fault\\", in her infamous monotone and is rather indifferent to the pain.\\"Lost in Parking Space, Part Two\\" Drawn Together Also, at one point in the MTV animated series Undergrads, Gimpy is talking to his friends via webcam when a female hacker hacks into the video stream and edits Gimpy to look like Daria. In late 2010, following the DVD release, Daria was licensed as a voice for Garmin and TomTom GPS systems; original putdowns and jokes were recorded.Navtones.com She made a brief appearance in the Family Guy episode \\"Peter & Lois' Wedding\\", where Joe Swanson tried to flirt with her in a flashback of the 90s. Reception Carol A. Stabile and Mark Harrison, authors of Prime Time Animation: Television Animation and American Culture, said that \\"for the cerebral, writerly types who liked television Daria was the outcast she-hero who dared to say things they were too scared to say in their teenage years.\\" Van Toffler, then the general manager of MTV, said in 1998 that Daria \\"has an attitude about parents, school, and siblings that is common to the experiences of our audience. She is a good spokesperson for MTV... intelligent but subversive.\\" A 1997 The Nation article referred to Daria as \\"a 10th grade Dorothy Parker\\". Another critic praising the character said that she is like \\"a 50-year-old deadpan Jewish comic in the body of a 16-year-old\\". Jennifer Vineyard, a writer of My Life as Liz, said \\"Daria made it cool to be a smart chick.\\" Vineyard added, \\"Just the presence of people or characters like Daria help make it cool to be yourself. There's a tendency for young girls to play dumb. Characters like Daria show you that you don't have to.\\" Some commentators believed that the character's deadpan humor had too much morbidity for the teenage audience. A critic said that Daria uses her \\"omnivorous deadpan\\" contempt against other people, represented a variety of \\"living death\\", and was \\"a grim reaper in a dress\\" who was more dangerous than Marilyn Manson. Anita Gates of The New York Times said \\"And some people like her just because she says mean things.

Pierre was born in South Australia in 1961, before moving to Mexico, where he was largely raised. He has resided in the Republic of Ireland and now, according to an August 2020 interview in The Guardian, lives in Cambridgeshire.. Pierre was awarded the 2003 Booker Prize for fiction for Vernon God Little, his first novel, becoming the third Australian-born author to be so honoured. Upon winning the Whitbread First Novel Award in 2003 he became the first writer to receive a Booker and a Whitbread for the same book. The book also won the Bollinger Wodehouse Everyman Prize for comic literature at the Hay Festival in 2003, and earned the author a James Joyce Award from the Literary and Historical Society of University College Dublin.  Early life  Born in Old Reynella, South Australia, where his father was lecturing in genetics at the University of Adelaide, by the age of two Pierre had already spent time in the United States, the South Pacific and Great Britain. He was then raised from early childhood into his 20s in Mexico City's community of Jardines del Pedregal, and attended Edron Academy. Pierre was taken to revisit his home by Alan Yentob for the BBC television series Imagine in 2004. He recalls, in a Guardian article of 1 September 2004, that he would later return to Durham most years, usually around the second week in July, to see the Durham Miners Gala. Aged seven, he fell ill with hepatitis and had to spend a year in bed. After he recovered, his parents were faced with the choice of keeping him a year behind in school, or letting him stay in his class and just catch up. They chose the latter. Pierre sees this as the moment \\"when all the trouble began... \\" as it meant his falling out with his peers. His father, once decorated as a Lancaster Bomber pilot in World War II, by then a scientific partner to Nobel Peace Prize winner Norman E. Borlaug, fell ill when Pierre was sixteen, and died three years later. Middle years Pierre's permanent residency in Mexico ended at Reynosa on the United States-Mexican border in the middle of the night when he claims he was stopped trying to import a 6-litre sports car. He claims he intended to drive through the Sonoran Desert to Mexico City, but Mexico at the time had a protectionist auto industry, making foreign vehicle imports illegal to all but tourists. Pierre succeeded in crossing with the car but found his papers cancelled by the time he reached Mexico City some 18 hours later. The border crossing at Reynosa is described and celebrated in Pierre's novel Vernon God Little, as is the journey by road from the border. Pierre asserts that of the following years, nine were spent in a drug-induced haze, culminating with a stay in Australia where he finally collapsed. He described this period of his life in an interview given on the Australian television show Enough Rope with Andrew Denton in 2006: During his twenties he had been involved in a film production to explore the fall of the Aztec Empire and follow trails to the remains of Aztec Emperor Moctezuma, and possibly to his lost treasure, the whereabouts of which remains one of Mexico's great mysteries. For most of the 1990s, he wrote his first novel whilst living in Balham, south London, finally agreeing a publication deal with Faber & Faber on 11 September 2001. In the following weeks he relocated to County Leitrim, Ireland, where he began work on a second novel. The Booker Prize comes with a monetary award of ¬£50,000. Upon being notified of his victory, Pierre said that the money would go part way toward paying off the debts incurred in his 20s, when psychological issues and drug abuse were driving forces. The letters in his pen name stand for \\"Dirty but clean\\" in reference to his former hardships. Recent years In 2005 DBC Pierre revisited the Mexico of his youth to finally explore and document the downfall of the Aztecs. In this revealing Channel 4 documentary he revisits the Aztecs' epic tale of decline and conquest. The Last Aztec, part historical film and part road movie, was aired in 2006 and follows Pierre as he traces the advance of the Spanish conquistadors toward the Aztec capital. It also picks up the threads he had intended to pursue in his ill-fated production of years earlier, centring on the wizards and witches of an Otomi culture in a remote valley in the Sierra Madre mountains of central Mexico. In 2007 his first novel, Vernon God Little, was adapted by Tanya Ronder for the London stage. It was directed by Rufus Norris at the Young Vic from 27 April ‚Äì 9 June. To date the work has been translated in more than 40 countries worldwide and produced as a play by at least four theatre companies. In 2009, he donated the short story \\"Suddenly Dr Cox\\" to Oxfam's Ox-Tales project, four collections of UK stories written by 38 authors. Pierre's story was published in the Air collection. He is also a contributor to the 2009 rock biography on The Triffids Vagabond Holes: David McComb and the Triffids, edited by Australian academics Niall Lucy and Chris Coughran.Niall Lucy and Chris Coughran, eds.

Biography Jorge Pullin attended the University of Buenos Aires (electrical engineering) for two years before leaving for Instituto Balseiro in Argentina to finish a M.Sc. in Physics (1986). Then he moved to the University of C√≥rdoba to pursue his Ph.D. which was submitted in 1988 to the Instituto Balseiro; his advisor was Reinaldo J. Gleiser. He moved to Syracuse University in 1989 and to the University of Utah in 1991 as a postdoc. He joined the faculty of Penn State University in 1993, where he was promoted to associate professor in 1997 and full professor in 2000. In 2001 he moved to Louisiana State University, where he is the co- director of the Horace Hearne Institute, along with Jonathan Dowling. Pullin's wife Gabriela Gonz√°lez is also a gravitational physics researcher; she and Pullin met at a gravitational physics meeting in C√≥rdoba, Argentina.

Research Pullin's book (with R. Gambini) Loops, Knots, Gauge Theories and Quantum Gravity. surveys the state of the art in loop quantum gravity at the time of its publication. Reviewer Jerzy Lewandowski writes \\"the book should allow people from outside the loopy circles to gain access in the current state of the art. But most of all it allows experts within this wide field to learn more about the original constructions which were invented and applied in quantization of gravity by Gambini and Pullin themselves.\\". Chris Isham adds that \\"this is a most valuable addition to the scientific literature\\",. while Hugo A. Morales-T√©cotl calls it \\"useful for an immersion in the subject.\\". Pullin's most-cited research paper, on nonstandard optics,. studies the propagation of light within theories of loop quantum gravity and shows that these theories lead to predictions of behavior different from Maxwell's equations for light propagation in classical physics. Pullin, Gambini, and Bernd Br√ºgman also wrote a series of papers that make an important connection between knot theory and quantum gravity, by showing that the Jones polynomial can be used to solve a quantum form of Einstein's equations.. . . Pullin is also known for a series of papers on the theory and numerical simulation of colliding black holes.E.g., . . . . Pullin's early work on the subject (including his second most cited paper, from 1994) involves the \\"close approximation\\" in which a pair of nearby black holes is treated mathematically as a single non-spherical black hole; since joining LSU his work on this area has been based instead on supercomputer simulation. Another pair of his papers studies a simplified mathematical model of the radiation emitted when a star collapses into a black hole, and shows that it compares favorably to numerical simulations.. . Quantum mechanics Pullin, along with R. Gambini, has proposed a new interpretation of quantum mechanics, called the \`Montevideo interpretation'.Gambini, R. and Pullin, J. 2018, Entropy, 20, no. 6, p.413, also arXiv:1502.03410 This name was chosen for its similarity with the more orthodox \`Copenhagen interpretation' and a reference to the city of origin. The Montevideo interpretation is an alternative to the Copenhagen interpretation, both seeking to understand the deepest meaning of quantum mechanics. The need for an interpretation is because the extremely- well-verified equations of quantum mechanics leaves unaddressed various issue concerning the nature of reality, the ultimate accuracy of measurement, hidden variables, and the idea of multiple universes. The issues revolve around the nature of the collapse of the quantum wave function as made by a measurement, with the famous example being understanding of Schroedinger's Cat. The Montevideo interpretation adds gravity into the picture, where there must be fundamental limits on the accuracy of any clock, and this introduces a decoherence into all systems, which acts as a measurement. \\"This interpretation explains the emergence of the classical world via decoherence through the interaction with the environment plus loss of coherence of the quantum theory when studied with real clocks and measuring rods... The combined effect of both losses of coherence implies that all information about quantum coherence in the system plus apparatus plus environment becomes inaccessible. After a while, there is no experimental arrangement that is able to decide if the evolution of the state of the complete quantum system was unitary or suffered a collapse. Whenever such situation of undecidability is reached, the interpretation assumes that an event (measurement) takes place.\\"Gambini, R. and Pullin, J. 2009, J. Phys. Conf. Ser., 174, 012003, also arXiv:0905.4402 The physics of the Montevideo interpretation is all classical quantum mechanics and General Relativity, but the philosophical implications are deep.Butterfield, J.

The site presently houses the George P. Shultz National Foreign Affairs Training Center, and the Army National Guard's Herbert R. Temple, Jr. Readiness Center. It is located on Arlington Boulevard (U.S. Route 50) between S. Glebe Road (State Route 120) and S. George Mason Drive.  History  U.S. Army Signals Intelligence Service personnel at Arlington Hall (c. 1943) DIA office at Arlington Hall Station (c. 1970s) Arlington Hall was founded in 1927 as a private post-secondary women's educational institution, which, by 1941, resided on a campus and had acquired the name \\"Arlington Hall Junior College for Women\\". The school suffered financial problems in the 1930s, and eventually became a non-profit institution in 1940.Official site of Arlington County, Virginia Text-Site: Our Back Pages: Stories, Scenes and Events From Arlington's Past Accessed January 11, 2009 On June 10, 1942, the U.S. Army took possession of the facility under the War Powers Act for use by its Signals Intelligence Service.On The Trail of Military Intelligence History: A Guide to the Washington, DC, Area: Arlington Hall: From Coeds to Codewords' prepared by the United States Army Intelligence and Security Command History Office, pp. 16‚Äì17 Accessed January 17, 2008 During World War II, Arlington Hall was in many respects similar to Bletchley Park in England (though BP also covered naval codes), and was only one of two primary cryptography operations in Washington (the other was the Naval Communications Annex, also housed in a commandeered private girls' school). Arlington Hall concentrated its efforts on the Japanese systems (including PURPLE) while Bletchley Park concentrated on European combatants. Initially work was on Japanese diplomatic codes as Japanese army codes were not solved until April 1943, but in September 1943 with success on the Army codes they were put under Solomon Kullback in a separate branch B-II, with other mainly diplomatic work under Frank Rowlett in B-III (which also had the Bombes and Rapid Analytical Machinery). The third branch B-I translated Japanese decrypts. The Arlington Hall effort was comparable in influence to other Anglo-American Second World War-era technological efforts, such as the cryptographic work at Bletchley Park, the Naval Communications Annex, development of sophisticated microwave radar at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT)'s Radiation Lab, and the Manhattan Project's development of the atomic bombs used on Hiroshima and Nagasaki in August 1945 to abruptly end the war and later initiated further development of nuclear weapons. After World War II, the \\"Russian Section\\" at Arlington Hall expanded. Work on diplomatic messages benefited from additional technical personnel and new analysts‚Äîamong them Samuel Chew, who had focused on Japan, and linguist Meredith Gardner, who had worked on both German and Japanese messages. Chew had considerable success at defining the underlying structure of the coded Russian texts. Gardner and his colleagues began analytically reconstructing the KGB (Soviet Union's Committee for State Security) spy agency codebooks. Late in 1946, Gardner broke the codebook's \\"spell table\\" for encoding English letters. With the solution of this spell table, SIS could read significant portions of messages that included English names and phrases. Gardner soon found himself reading a 1944 message listing prominent atomic scientists, including several with the Manhattan Project. Efforts to decipher Soviet codes continued under the classified and caveated Venona project. Another problem soon arose‚Äîthat of determining how and to whom to disseminate the extraordinary information Gardner was developing. SIS's reporting procedures did not seem appropriate because the decrypted messages could not even be paraphrased for Arlington Hall's regular intelligence customers without divulging their source. By 1946, SIS knew nothing about the federal grand jury impaneled in Manhattan to probe the espionage and disloyalty charges stemming from Elizabeth Bentley's defection and other defectors from Soviet intelligence, so no one in the U.S. Government was aware that evidence against the Soviets was suddenly developing on two adjacent tracks. In late August or early September 1947, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) was informed that the Army Security Agency had begun to break into Soviet espionage messages. By 1945, the Soviets had penetrated Arlington Hall with the placement of Bill Weisband who worked there for several years. The Government's knowledge of his treason apparently was not revealed until its publication in a 1990 book co-authored by a high-level KGB defector. Arlington Hall came under the aegis of the National Security Agency after this agency was created in 1952. From 1945 to 1977, Arlington Hall served as the headquarters of the United States Army Security Agency and, for a brief period in late 1948, the newly formed United States Air Force Security Service (USAFSS) until they relocated to Brooks Air Force Base in San Antonio, Texas. When the United States Army Intelligence and Security Command (INSCOM) was commissioned at Arlington Hall on January 1, 1977, INSCOM absorbed the functions of the Army Security Agency into its operations. INSCOM remained at Arlington Hall until the summer of 1989, when INSCOM relocated to Fort Belvoir, Virginia. Beginning in January 1963, Arlington Hall served as the premier facility of the newly created Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA).Defense Intelligence Agency's Text-Site: DIA History Accessed January 11 In 1984, DIA departed Arlington Hall for their new headquarters on Joint Base Anacostia‚ÄìBolling (former Bolling Air Force Base), a move that was complete by December 1984.On The Trail of Military Intelligence History, p. 17 Accessed January 17, 2008US Army Intelligence and Security Command's (INSCOM) Text- Site: INSCOM History, by the INSCOM History Office Accessed January 17, 2008 Arlington Hall was also home in the late 1950s and early 1960s to the Armed Services Technical Information Agency (ASTIA) which disseminated classified research to defense contractors. In 1989, the U.S. Department of Defense transferred the eastern portion of Arlington Hall to the Department of State.

The park follows a rough, undeveloped of the Cossatot River. The river itself is included in Arkansas's Natural and Scenic Rivers System and the National Park Service's list of National Wild and Scenic Rivers, making it a whitewater rafting destination. The rough nature of the river, including Class III, IV, and dangerous Class V rapids, make the park-natural area a popular destination for skilled canoeists, kayakers, and playboaters. The park became a part of the system in 1988 after the Arkansas Department of Parks and Tourism and Arkansas Natural Heritage Commission agreed to cooperative management after acquiring the property from the Weyerhaeuser Corporation. History The Arkansas Natural Heritage Commission contacted the Weyerhaeuser Corporation, the land's owner, about developing a park from the wilderness along the Cossatot River in 1975. Although receptive of the offer, Weyerhaeuser was concerned that the Commission would not properly manage the dangerous rapids. It wasn't until 1984 when the Arkansas Department of Parks and Tourism offered to join the Commission in a joint venture to acquire the land in an attempt to allay the fears of Weyerhaeuser. After a joint meeting, The Nature Conservancy held the land in trust until state funds were allocated for the park. The duality of the park-natural area's management is still represented. The park was expanded after Arkla Gas Company donated in exchange for crossing the Cossatot River with a gas pipeline. Recreation The Cossatot River features Class III, IV, and dangerous Class V rapids making it one of the more challenging float rivers in the central United States. Brushy Creek Recreation Area offers restrooms, picnic tables, and access to the river via the Highway 246 bridge access point. Campsites are available at the Cossatot Falls Area (7 sites, no hookups), Sandbar Area (14 sites, no hookups), and the Ed Banks Area (one site, no hookups). The park is also home to dozens of rare flora and fauna native only to the Ouachita Mountains and surrounding Ouachita National Forest. The terrain of the park is a rugged rocky canyon with old growth hardwoods and juniper glades. Hiking is available on the River Corridor Trail () and Harris Creek Trail (). A visitor's center, built in 2004, offers a wildlife observation room, a water education laboratory, and a gift shop.

Ballad types The ballads belong to various groups of subjects, such as riding ballads like Kinmont Willie, historical ballads like Sir Patrick Spens, and comic ballads like Get Up and Bar the Door About this book - inside front cover of Collections Representative samples include \\"Thomas the Rhymer\\" (also known as \\"True Thomas\\", \\"Thomas of Erceldoune\\"), which opens in the Scottish town of Erceldoune (modern Earlston, Berwickshire); and \\"Tam Lin\\". Writings about Sir Walter Scott wrote about border ballads in Minstrelsy of the Scottish Border - which was first published in 1802-3. A.L.

Located on the former homesite of pioneer Benjamin Crowley, the park contains many excellent examples of the work done by the Civilian Conservation Corps in the 1930s. One of Arkansas's most popular state parks, the parks is bisected by Crowley's Ridge Parkway, a National Scenic Byway. The site became a state park in 1933 in an effort to honor Crowley and the heritage of the Crowley's Ridge area. Recreation Lake Ponder The park was originally constructed in the 1930s by the Civilian Conservation Corps and the original stone and log structures give the park a rustic feel.

As the National Liberal League suffered crippling factionalism and radicalization over the period 1878 to 1885, liberals reorganized in a non-political \\"American Secular Union\\" in 1884. Colonel Robert Green Ingersoll (1833-1899) served as the first president of the Union. Ida Craddock was elected Secretary of the Philadelphia chapter of the Union in 1889. The American Secular Union and Freethought Federation dedicated themselves to the separation of church and state, and for its platform used the nine demands of liberalism,The New Encyclopedia of Social Reform, p. 39 namely: # that churches and other ecclesiastical property shall be no longer exempt from taxation; # that the employment of chaplains in the United States Congress, in state legislaturess in the United States Army and United States Navy, and in prisons, asylums, and all institutions supported by public money, shall be discontinued, and that all religious services maintained by national, state, or municipal governments shall be abolished; # that all public appropriations for educational and charitable institutions of a sectarian character shall cease; # that, while advocating the loftiest instruction in morals and the inculcation of the strictest uprightness of conduct, religious teaching and the use of the Bible for religious purposes in public schools shall be prohibited; # that the appointment by the President of the United States and the governors of the various states of religious festivals, fasts, and days of prayer and thanksgiving shall be discontinued; # that the theological oath in the courts and in other departments of government shall be abolished, and simple affirmation under the pains and penalties of perjury, established in its stead; # that all laws directly or indirectly enforcing in any degree the religious and theological dogmaated, and that all laws shall be conformed to the requirements of natural morality, equal rights and impartial justice; # that, in harmony with the Constitution of the United States and the constitutions of the several states, no special privileges or advantages shall be conceded to Christianity or any other religion; that our entire political system shall be conducted and administered on a purely secular basis; and that whatever changes are necessary to this end shall be consistently, unflinchingly, and promptly made. The American Secular Union published over a dozen pamphlets on topics regarding separation of church and state between 1886 and 1928. Following Ingersoll's death in 1899 various leadership changes occurred. The organization withered around 1919.

It is one of the largest territorial police forces in England covering and a population of over 2.1 million people. The police force consists of 4,244 constables, 506 special constables, 466 Police Community Support Officers (PCSO) and 2,576 police staff. History Prior to the Municipal Corporations Act 1835 there were ancient ways of keeping law and order through Parish constables or quasi police bodies who conducted a wide range of duties. Modern policing in Thames Valley can be traced back to the 1835 act when a number of boroughs set up police forces. For example Newbury Borough Police were operating as a small police force soon after the passing of the Act. The force was one of around twenty borough forces that were later amalgamated with their county police force. These were Buckinghamshire Constabulary, Oxfordshire Constabulary, Berkshire Constabulary, Reading Borough Police and Oxford City Police founded in 1857, 1857, 1856, 1836 and 1868 respectively. Under the Police Act 1964 these five forces were amalgamated on 1 April 1968 to form the Thames Valley Constabulary. =Chief Constables= * Thomas Charles Birkett Hodgson, (1968‚Äì1971) * David Holdsworth (1971‚Äì1979) * Peter Imbert (1979‚Äì1985) * Colin Smith (1985‚Äì1991) * Sir Charles Pollard (1991‚Äì2001) * Peter Neyroud (2002‚Äì2007) * Sara Thornton (2007‚Äì2015) * Francis Habgood (2015-2019) * John Campbell (2019 - present) Governance Thames Valley Police is overseen by a locally elected Thames Valley Police and Crime Commissioner. The incumbent commissioner is Anthony Stansfeld, a Conservative Party candidate elected with 34.7% of the votes in the first round of voting and 57.2% of the votes after the second round. The police and crime commissioner is scrutinised by the Thames Valley Police and Crime Panel. Thames Valley was previously overseen by a police authority consisting of 19 members, made up of councillors, members from unitary authorities, independents and a magistrate. Organisation In April 2011, the force adopted a Local Policing Model. As a result, the force is now split into twelve Local Policing Areas (LPAs), each led by a superintendent. These consist of one or two local authority areas. These are in turn split into a number of neighbourhoods which are based on ward and parish boundaries. This alignment is to ensure that local policing services are delivered in an accountable manner. =Local Policing Areas= * Aylesbury * Bracknell and WokinghamCherwell and West Oxfordshire * Chiltern and South Bucks * Milton Keynes * Oxford * Reading * South Oxfordshire and Vale of White Horse * Slough * West Berkshire * Windsor and Maidenhead * Wycombe (*Bracknell LPA and Wokingham LPA merged to form the Bracknell & Wokingham LPA in early 2016.) Each area is responsible for delivering response policing, neighborhood policing teams and a local priority crime and Criminal Investigation Department (CID). Other functions that used to be held at Basic Command Unit (BCU) level (essentially a cluster of geographically grouped LPAs) are now delivered at Force Headquarters level using a shared service approach. = Force Headquarters Teams = A number of teams are run from Force Headquarters with their staff deployed at various locations around the Force area: * Major Investigation Team * Control and Communications * Police Dog Section * Counter Terrorism Unit * Intelligence Agency  Operations  = Neighbourhood Policing Team (NHPT) = Thames Valley Police has a local policing team working from every police station. These teams consist of officers, community support, special constables and police staff who work to patrol and attend local incidents. They use marked vans which read neighbourhood policing on the side rear panel under the Thames Valley Police corporate logo. These officers will typically be unarmed and rarely carry taser weapons. The neighbourhood police vans double up as prisoner transport vans. However, most LPA police vehicles are available to this unit. = Incident Crime Response (ICR) = LPA Response units work out of most major stations in the force area and are tasked with patrolling and responding to 999 calls. These officers are often constables issued with X2 tasers. These officers may be tasked to patrol high crime areas for an increased police presence or to conduct follow up investigations. Both the Neighbourhood Policing Group and Incident Response Unit units all share the LPA standard Vauxhall Astra Estate police car. Some rural police offices make use of Mitsubishi L200's as a more effective vehicle. = Police Dog Section = Thames Valley Police have approximately 52 operational police dogs. The dogs are mostly donated from the RSPCA or public, and are trained at the force headquarters. They usually serve until they are 8 years old, receiving refresher training every year, and then living with their handler after retirement. They are part of the Joint Operations Unit with Hampshire Police. The dog section operates with marked and unmarked Mitsubishi Outlanders as well as Ford Mondeo estates. = Roads Policing Unit = Thames Valley Police patrols of motorways including the M1, M4, M40, A329(M), A404(M) and M25, as well as many other 'A' route roads including the busy A43. The Unit Mainly uses Marked Volvo V70s and New BMW 530d touring's, Unmarked BMW 330ds and Volvo V80's along with some Marked BMW X5s and Mitsubishi Shoguns. These units are based at 6 geographical traffic bases (Milton Keynes, Taplow, Three Mile Cross (Reading), Bicester, Amersham and Abingdon). Roads Policing in Thames Valley is part of the Joint Operations Unit which works together with Hampshire Constabulary's Roads Policing Unit. = Armed Response Unit = Thames Valley Police's Armed Response Unit is a 24/7 unit that responds to major and serious crimes where firearms may be involved. This unit is shared with Hampshire Police as part of the Joint Operations Unit. The training facility is at Sulhamstead with a state of the art firearms range. The unit mostly uses the traffic bases within the force, mainly basing themselves out of Three Mile Cross (Reading), Milton Keynes, Bicester. This unit can be identified by the red asterisk on the marked patrol cars they use, which includes the Volvo XC70 and BMW X5. The unit also uses unmarked vehicles. = Specialist Pro-Active Team = Thames Valley Police has recently centralized all 3 of its Pro-Active teams to be run as a 'shared service' from its headquarters. The team consists of 28 tactical police officers and are tasked through a bidding system which is used in order to gain their services. The team works in a number of areas including Forced Method of Entry, Targeted intelligence policing and specialist surveillance of criminals both covertly and overtly. The teams use various types of vehicles both visible and unmarked and work 24 hours a day across the force. = Air Operations Unit = The Air Support Unit was officially created in 1982 but the use of helicopters in Thames Valley goes back to 1963, when Oxford City Police experimented with a Brantley helicopter with a dog basket attached to the skids. Thames Valley Police rented helicopters for use on special occasions in the 1970s and '80s. The unit was founded in 1982 when part-time daylight flights were routinely contracted and eight Sergeants were transferred from Traffic and Operations to ASU. The unit rented a Eurocopter A350 by the day, planning to fly only 650 hours every year. In 1986 the unit was moved to RAF Abingdon. In 1988 Thames Valley Police hired professional police observers for ASU. In the same year, the department became a full-time operational unit, only the third in the country at the time. Thames Valley Police bought a new helicopter in 1993. In 1996 Thames Valley Police, Bedfordshire Police and Hertfordshire Constabulary combined funding and founded the Chiltern Air Support Unit, having received funding in 1995 to buy a second helicopter. The alliance is recognised to have started unofficially in 1992, when Thames Valley would sell flying time to its nearby forces. In 1999 and 2002 the two Eurocopter A350s were replaced by two Eurocopter EC135s, which are still in use today. As of 2013 the management of Police Air-Support nationally has moved to NPASS (the National Police Air Support Service). =Search and Recovery Unit= Founded in 1956 as the Underwater Search Unit of Berkshire Constabulary and transferred to Thames Valley Police under a new name, the unit today is made up of one sergeant and seven constables and respond to around 350 operations each year. The unit are involved in a variety of searching operations in river, underwater, underground, and cliff face conditions, searching for bodies, explosives, drugs, property, contraband and firearms and environments that can be affected by Chemical, Biological, Radioactive and Nuclear radiation. The unit was disbanded April 2015 as a result of national police budget constraints. = Special Mounted Branch = The Thames Valley Mounted Branch based in Milton Keynes. The unit has fourteen police horses. The unit is responsible for preventing equine crime, assisting in searches of rural areas, and mainly maintaining public order at demonstrations and sporting events, including the four football grounds in Thames Valley. =Protection Group= Thames Valley Police has the largest non-Metropolitan Police Service operated Protection Group. This highly specialist department are responsible for guarding multiple fixed locations and protecting any visiting parties that require special attention. The officers on this department are some of the most highly trained and skilled within the force. They also supply an Armed Support Vehicle to support the static sites and deal with intense spontaneous incidents. The officers in the unit are required to pass stringent testing, they are Authorised Firearms Officers and also trained in advanced driving, advanced first aid, method of entry amongst many other highly specialist skills. = Public Order Department = Based in Heyford Park, formerly RAF Upper Heyford, in Oxfordshire. The POD is responsible for providing tactical support during spontaneous or pre-planned events that may result in public disorder. This includes sporting events such as football matches and Royal Ascot, music festivals such as Reading Festival, and lawful demonstrations. =Counter Terrorism Unit= Thames Valley Police's Counter Terrorist Unit is responsible for responding to any search related or explosive or terrorist incident, working with Protection Unit to guard anyone deemed to be at risk and with dog section to locate the explosive. The unit has four explosive ordnance disposal advisors. Locations The headquarters of Thames Valley Police is at Oxford Road, Kidlington, Oxfordshire. Thames Valley Police has 48 police stations, with 16 Front Counters open to the public. The force is covered by two control rooms, one in Abingdon, and one in Milton Keynes. Thames Valley Police Training College and Police Museum. Thames Valley Police station in St Aldate's, Oxford. The three Police Contact Centres were formed in 2003, following the closure of local control rooms, to support the newly formed control rooms in Abingdon and Milton Keynes. They are located at the force headquarters in Kidlington, and separate teams within the Abingdon and Milton Keynes control rooms. The Contact Centres handle all emergency, non-emergency and enquiry calls from the public. Sulhamstead House in Sulhamstead is the Thames Valley Police training college, which also houses the Thames Valley Police Museum. There are also several Roads Policing bases at strategic locations around the force at Abingdon, Bicester, Taplow, Amersham, Milton Keynes, and Three Mile Cross. Presentation = Headgear = Thames Valley Police officers wear the traditional custodian helmet in the comb style with a Brunswick star that reads 'Thames Valley Police' for foot patrol. This was dropped for practicality and cost reasons in 2009, but was reintroduced in 2018. Female officers wear a bowler hat, or a white bowler hat for traffic officers. In 2009 Thames Valley Police proposed to be the first force to introduce the use of baseball caps as a primary mode of headgear. After trials were conducted the proposal was dropped as being 'a step too far from the professional image of the force'. = Uniform = When on duty, officers wear a short sleeve black wicking T-shirt with 'Police' on the sleeves, and black uniform trousers with a cargo pocket on each leg. Thames Valley Police no longer use the traditional police jumper, having favoured a black soft-shell with police written on the chest and back. Thames Valley Police do not have Brunswick stars on their epaulettes, just the rank and shoulder number. Formal dress comprises an open-necked tunic, with a white shirt/blouse and tie for both male and female officers. All officers wear peaked caps and their rank on their epaulettes. The No.1 uniform is accompanied by black boots or shoes and occasionally black gloves. The operational uniform, until 2009, consisted of traditional white shirt and tie with custodian helmets for Constables and Sergeants, but this was dropped when it was deemed to be impractical and outdated, not withstanding the retention of this uniform by other forces, and the almost universal retention of the helmet. However, starting with the Royal Wedding of the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, TVP has started issuing the Custodian helmet again. = Equipment = Thames Valley Police officers carry Airwave digital radios, TCH rigid handcuffs, CapTor2 incapacitant spray, the autolock 22\\" collapsible baton, leg restraints, a resuscitation mask and a basic first aid kit. The PCSOs do not carry autolock, handcuffs, leg restraints or incapacitant spray. Should they be required to, some Thames Valley officers can use body-mounted cameras. Police vehicles contain a variety of equipment, which can include Arnold batons, traffic cones, road signs, breathalyzers, stingers, speed guns, ANPR cameras and more. = Vehicles = Thames Valley Police use various vehicles depending on the role they are required for. The bulk of TVP vehicles are Vauxhall. Vauxhall Astras (currently the Mark 6) are used as general purpose marked vehicles, they are used by both LPA response officers and members of LPA Neighbourhood Policing Group. Vauxhall Corsas are also used as patrol vehicles by PCSOs and may either be branded (bearing force insignia but no battenburg) or unmarked. Vauxhall Vivaro Vans are used by Neighbourhood policing teams, and also to transport violent prisoners. Vauxhall Movanos are used for riot/protest events and officer transport - these are slowly being replaced as of 2018 with Mercedes Sprinters The Joint Operations Unit shared with Hampshire Police typically uses: Dog Section - Marked and Unmarked Mitsubishi Outlanders and Ford Mondeo Estates Armed Response Unit - Marked and Unmarked Volvo XC70s and BMW X5s Roads Policing Unit - Mainly using Marked Volvo V70s and New BMW 530d touring's, Unmarked BMW 330ds and Volvo V80's along with some Marked BMW X5s and Mitsubishi Shoguns. Some of the Older cars that the Thames Valley Police use was cars like the Vauxhall Senator, Rover SD1, SEAT Toledo, Vauxhall Omega & Mercedes E220. = Livery = Thames Valley Police use the modern yellow and blue retro-reflective battenberg markings all over all operational vehicles, as well as the Thames Valley Police shield, and the contact phone number. The only exception of this is NPT cars, which only have markings on the back and front, and read 'Neighbourhood Policing Team' on the side. Thames Valley Police stopped using the 'jam sandwich' police car markings between 2000-2005 when battenburg markings were adopted and implemented. =Name= Thames Valley Police has changed its name only once in its own history in 1971, from Thames Valley Constabulary to Thames Valley Police, a common change in most police forces that makes them more accessible. Thames Valley Police's motto in Latin is Sit pax in valle tamesis meaning 'Let there be Peace in the Thames Valley', their slogan is 'Reducing crime, disorder and fear'. The Thames Valley Police shield is made up of features from the shields of its five founding constabularies including a blue river depicting the Thames river and five crowns palisado depicting the five founding forces. The stag is a symbol of the county of Berkshire, the ox a symbol of the county of Oxfordshire and the swan a symbol of the county of Buckinghamshire. Together they represent the ceremonial counties of the force area. Strength and recruitment Thames Valley Police employs 7,900 people and 908 volunteers. Of which 4250 are warranted Police Officers, over 500 are Police Community Support Officers and 3150 are civilian staff. Of the 908 volunteers, 500 are Police Support Volunteers and 733 are warranted Special Constables. Thames Valley Police recruits people for voluntary roles. Their Police Support Volunteer scheme is one of the largest in the country, they now have 500 PSVs. Their Special Constabulary is also growing. Training for new recruits in Thames Valley is held at Sulhamstead House in Sulhamstead, England. For Constables it consists of 13 weeks of residential training. Officers will achieve fit for independent patrol status once on area, usually 4 to 5 months after completing initial training. For PCSOs it consists of 18 weeks' training. For Special Constables it consists of between six and seven months of training at weekends, with mandatory online training in between. Special Constables will achieve fit for independent patrol status, usually within one year, but this is dependent on the number of tours of duty. Recruits usually receive their uniform in the first week of training. warrant cards are issued at attestation, at the start of the second day of training. Once the training period is over, the new officers are posted in a local division for a tutorship and attachment phase lasting around 16 weeks. =Future of Thames Valley Police= In a report published by HM Inspectorate of Constabulary in July 2011, the impact on the number of police officers and staff partly due to the reduction to Thames Valley Police's budget following the comprehensive spending review is as follows: { border=\\"1\\" cellpadding=\\"3\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" style=\\"text-align:left; border-collapse:collapse;\\" - style=\\"background:#efefef;\\" ! style=\\"width:80px;\\" ! style=\\"width:50px;\\" Police officers ! style=\\"width:50px;\\" Police staff ! style=\\"width:50px;\\" PCSOs ! style=\\"width:50px;\\" Total - ! 31 March 2010 (actual)  4,268  2,855  500  7,623 - ! 31 March 2015 (proposed)  4,034  2,541  453  7,028 } March 2010 figures exclude 166 officers and 145 staff who were paid through the Thames Valley payroll system but were seconded to national and regional duties and were externally funded.  Performance  = Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary = A report from March 2010 by Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary marked Thames Valley Police as 'fair' on local crime and policing, 'fair' on protection from serious harm and 'fair' on confidence and satisfaction. In detail, Thames Valley was awarded only one 'excellent' for reducing road death and injury. They were 'fair' in all other categories except 'solving crime' and 'comparative satisfaction of BME community' and 'low/medium' for 'number of police officers and PCSOs'. They were praised for their 14% reduction in burglary after 'Operation Breaker' in July 2009. = Independent Police Complaints Commission = In the year 2008/9 the number of complaints recorded decreased by 2% but an increase of 8% above the previous years national average. The number of allegations recorded increased by 23% and 11% above the previous years national average. Thames Valley Police received 947 complaints and 1903 allegations, the national average being 338 per 1000 officers, TVP has 372, and TVP is just above 369 per 1000 officers, the average from a group of similar forces. Of allegations 23% were 'failure or neglect in duty', 19% were 'incivility, impoliteness and intolerance', 14% 'assault', 4% were 'discrimination' and 1% were 'breach of PACE Code A'. And of the 1903 allegations, 51% were investigated, 36% were locally resolved, 6% were withdrawn, 7% were dispensed and 0% were discontinued. Of the 51% allegations investigated 13% were substantiated and 87% were unsubstantiated. Thames Valley Police investigates the greatest amount of allegations compared to its peer forces, its investigation rate is 15% higher than the national average. Its use of 'local resolution' has dropped 12% since 2005/6. Thames Valley has fewer allegations that are withdrawn, dispensed or discontinued. Controversy =Firearms training incident= On 30 May 2007 at Thames Valley Police headquarters in Kidlington whilst teaching a half-day course on firearms, PC David Micklethwaite demonstrated a Magnum .44 revolver which he had mistakenly loaded with live rounds. He pointed the gun at Keith Tilbury, a police phone operator attending the course, and fired the gun, almost killing Mr Tilbury. The firearms instructor was reported to have failed the qualification at a Metropolitan Police training course, but TVP decided he would pass their less stringent test and was therefore suitable to teach the lesson, despite not having been provided with additional training since failing the Metropolitan Police course. The instructor was told to cover the lesson at short notice and accidentally picked up a live round from the force's armoury instead of dummy rounds. This mistake occurred due to both live and dummy rounds both being kept in the same Quality Street tin. Mr Tilbury underwent immediate surgery to his bowel, kidney, lung and liver. In court, it was said he was unlikely to work again. Thames Valley Police pleaded guilty to breaching regulations; they were fined ¬£40,000 and ¬£25,000 for legal costs. Constable Micklethwaite initially denied any wrongdoing, but later admitted to breaching the Health and Safety at Work Act. PC Micklethwaite was not charged with misconduct because he retired from the Thames Valley Police before misconduct proceedings could be completed. =Underage PCSOs= In 2007 Thames Valley Police admitted to being one of five UK forces that had employed Police Community Support Officers that were aged 16. This is not illegal as the minimum age limit of 18 applies to Constables, not PCSOs. However, concerns were raised that this represented \\"policing on the cheap\\" as candidates aged under 18 have a different wage scale and could cost ¬£10,000 less per annum. It was also feared that the officers were being placed in unreasonable danger as PCSOs have been attacked and stabbed in the past. Budget cuts =Proposed merger= Proposals made by the Home Secretary on 20 March 2006 would see the force stay as a single strategic police force for the area, a merger with Hampshire Constabulary having been rejected. Due to the large size of Thames Valley Police and that it is already made up of five police forces, it is unlikely it will be asked to merge with another force. =Budget deficit= Thames Valley Police has to make savings of ¬£52 million over the next four years. Chief Constable Thornton said that they would have to 'cut back on all non-essential activity'. 347 million pounds of savings have been identified including back office cuts and efficiency measures, as well as cutting officers numbers by 10%, meaning 800 officers. In the media The fictional Inspector Morse, the main character in 13 novels by Colin Dexter and 33 television episodes by ITV, works for Thames Valley Police, but in the spin-off series, Lewis, the force is referred to as Oxfordshire Police. In 1982 the BBC broadcast a nine-part series by Roger Graef and Charles Stewart entitled Police, which showed a fly- on-the-wall account of Thames Valley's E Division based in Reading. This featured the rather demeaning treatment of a female victim of rape which was much discussed in the media at the time. Between 2003 and 2008 a Sky1 programme, Road Wars, followed the Roads Policing Proactive and Problem Solving Team while they carried out their duties. The series followed a select group of officers on duty, who as a result became too well known causing the Chief Constable to ask Sky to move their programme to another force. Other activities =IT resource merger= Thames Valley Police and Hampshire Police authorities have agreed to share ICT support and infrastructure, with all IT workers now employees of Thames Valley Police. This will also include the Isle of Wight, a division of Hampshire Police. The partnership in Information Technology is the first of its kind in the country. =Thames Valley Police Museum= The 'White House' at Sulhamstead where the Thames Valley Police Museum is housed. The Thames Valley Police Museum is located within Sulhamstead House, known locally as the 'White House', at Sulhamstead in the English county of Berkshire. The site was formerly the headquarters of the Berkshire Constabulary, and is now the training centre for the Thames Valley Police. The museum is open by appointment. The museum includes displays on the history of Thames Valley Police and the five police forces that were amalgamated to form the force in 1968; the Buckinghamshire Constabulary, the Berkshire Constabulary, Oxford City Police, the Oxfordshire Constabulary and the Reading Borough Police. The museum's collections include items from the Great Train Robbery of 1963, uniforms, equipment, medals, photographs, scenes of crime evidence, and occurrence and charge books. In 2006, the exhibition space of the museum was renovated. Since September 2017 the museum has been temporarily closed prior to relocation.

Hill. A meeting of this union near Elaine, Arkansas, was disrupted on the evening of September 30, 1919. The fatal shooting of a white man sparked retaliation by whites; hundreds poured into the area, attacking blacks on sight and resulting in the Elaine Race Riot, believed to be the deadliest in American history. Background The Progressive Farmers and Household Union of America was formed by Robert L. Hill of Winchester, Arkansas, a black tenant farmer. He claimed chapters in 15 to 20 counties, and the union had several lodges in the Elaine area. In late 1919 the union organized resistance among blacks in the Elaine area: black women stopped working in domestic positions in white households, and the union demanded higher wages for cotton pickers. The union had also hired lawyers at the state capital and planned to sue landlords for shares allegedly withheld from tenant farmers and sharecroppers. Elaine race riot The union was largely destroyed by the violent riots and white repression that followed in Phillips County. Hundreds of whites formed militias to hunt down blacks throughout the county and suppress what they claimed was an \\"insurrection.\\" The Governor of Arkansas, Charles Hillman Brough, led a detachment of federal troops into the county, and hundreds of blacks were arrested. A total of five whites and an estimated 100-237 blacks were killed in the following days, some by troops. Other blacks were required to have passes signed by military authorities and attested by a reputable white citizen in order to move about in public. In the week after the shooting, roving bands of whites and federal troops killed an estimated 100 to 200 blacks in the area. After the violence, a grand jury, made up of all-white local landlords and merchants, decided who would be indicted. Those black men willing to testify against others and who agreed to work on whatever terms their landlords set for them were freed. Blacks labeled as ringleaders or who were judged \\"unreliable\\" were indicted. According to the affidavits later supplied by the defendants, many of the prisoners had been beaten, whipped or tortured by electric shocks to extract testimony or confessions; they were threatened with death if they were to recant such testimony. Robert Hill escaped to the state of Kansas during the first days of the riot. He was arrested there but the governor refused to extradite him to Arkansas to face charges. Some 122 blacks were indicted in Arkansas, with 73 charged with murder; no whites were prosecuted. Many suspects were beaten and tortured through electric shock to elicit forced testimony. The trials by all-white juries were dominated by armed whites milling around outside the courthouse, with some armed men inside the courtroom. Twelve men were convicted of murder and sentenced to death. Their appeals took two tracks, with six men (Ware et al.) winning reversals of their convictions in state court; they were retried and convicted, but won another appeal in the state supreme court. They were released in 1923 under Arkansas law after the state failed to retry them within two years. The convictions of the remaining six defendants (Moore et al.) were eventually reversed by the United States Supreme Court in Moore v. Dempsey , on the basis of violation of their right to due process because of the conditions of the trial and related publicity. This was an important precedent for the Supreme Court to review state criminal trials through application of the Bill of Rights. The NAACP, which had helped fund and commission the defense team, strengthened its reputation for working on behalf of African Americans. Walter F. White, the NAACP field secretary who had investigated the riot in the field, gained renown for his reporting on the massacre, including its high number of black fatalities. He later served for decades as executive secretary of the NAACP. Further reading * Cortner, Richard, A Mob Intent On Death: The NAACP and the Arkansas Riot Cases.

It is fundamental in the rook and pawn versus rook endgame. If the side with the pawn can reach this type of position, they can forcibly win the game. Most rook and pawn versus rook endgames reach either the Lucena position or the Philidor position if played accurately . The side with the pawn will try to reach the Lucena position to win; the other side will try to reach the Philidor position to draw. The position is named after the Spaniard Luis Ramirez de Lucena, although he did not analyze it or publish it . Introduction The Lucena position is named after the Spaniard Luis Ram√≠rez de Lucena, although it is something of a misnomer, because the position does not in fact appear in his book on chess, Repetici√≥n de Amores e Arte de Axedrez (1497). It does appear, however, in Alessandro Salvio's Il Puttino (1634), a romance on the career of the chess player Leonardo da Cutri, and it is in that form that it is given here .Note #5536 is about the origin Salvio attributes it to Scipione Genovino . It is likely that the error arose from the sixth edition of the Handbuch des Schachspiels, in which editor Constantin Schwede incorrectly attributed the position to \\"Lucena 96\\", possibly as a result of confusion over the references in Antonius van der Linde's 1874 work Das Schachspiel des XVI. Jahrhunderts. The position is shown above and below (the position can be moved as a whole or mirrored so that the pawn is on any of the files b through g). White's aim is to either promote his pawn or else compel Black to give up his rook for it ‚Äì either result will leave White with an overwhelming material advantage and a straightforward win. White has managed to advance his pawn to the seventh rank, but it is prevented from queening because his own king is in the way. White would like to move his king and then promote his pawn, but is prevented from moving to the a-file by the black rook, and prevented from moving to the c-file by the black king. The essential characteristics of the position are: * the pawn is any pawn except a rook pawn * the pawn has advanced to the seventh rank * the attacking king (the one with the pawn) is on the queening square of its pawn * the attacking rook cuts off the opposing king from the pawn by at least one file * the defending rook is on the file on the other side of the pawn An obvious approach by White (in the position above) such as : 1. Rd1+ Ke7 : 2. Kc7 gets nowhere. Black can simply harass the white king with checks, and White makes no progress: : 2... Rc2+ : 3. Kb6 Rb2+ : 4. Ka7 Ra2+ : 5. Kb8 The winning method: building a bridge In the Lucena position, the side with the pawn has a winning method that works for any pawn except a rook pawn (i.e. on the a- or h-file). In some circumstances, it also works for a rook pawn. In the Lucena position, White can win with : 1. Rd1+ Ke7 : 2. Rd4! Now, if Black plays a waiting move, such as : 2... Ra1 hoping to harass the white king with checks again as in the above variation, White continues : 3. Kc7 Rc1+ : 4. Kb6 Rb1+ : 5. Kc6 Rc1+ (Or 5.Ka6 Ra1+.) : 6. Kb5 Rb1+ : 7. Rb4! The black rook can no longer check the white king and Black cannot prevent the pawn from queening . White's shielding his king and pawn with the rook in this way was described as \\"building a bridge\\" by Aron Nimzowitsch . It is important that the white rook go initially to the fourth rank if Black uses his most active defense: repeatedly checking the white king. If Black abandons this defense, the white rook can build a bridge on the fifth rank. In the line above, after :5. Kc6 if Black moves :5... Ke6 there is a trap for White: if 6.Rd5?? (to build a bridge on the fifth rank) then 6...Rxb7! draws. However, if :6. Rd6+ (6.Re4+ followed by either 7.Re8 or (if 7...Kf7) 8.Re5 works as well.) :6... Ke7 :7. Rd5! and White can build a bridge on the fifth rank by getting the rook to b5, the king to b6, and then the pawn can promote (position reflected): :7... Rc1+ :8. Kb6 Rb1+ :9. Rb5 and White wins. If the defending rook is on the rank that would prevent moving the rook to the crucial rank (i.e. 2.Rd4), see Rook and pawn versus rook endgame#Defending rook prevents the bridge. =Black to move= If Black is to move in the diagrammed position, he can prevent the white rook from going to the fourth rank, but then White still wins: :1... Ra4 :2. Rd1+ Ke7 :3. Kc7 Rc4+ :4. Kb6 Rb4+ :5. Ka6 Rb2 (The black rook is not sufficiently far away to keep checking: if 5...Ra4+ then 6.Kb5 wins.) Now White wins by blocking the checks with :6. Rd5 followed by :7. Rb5 (position reflected). =Bridge on the fifth rank= A bridge can also be built on the fifth rank (but it is better to build one on the fourth rank). The main line goes: : 1. Rf5 (Instead of 1.Rf4!) : 1... Rc1 : 2. Ke7 Threatening to promote the pawn, Black can just delay it with checks. : 2... Re1+ : 3. Kd6 Rd1+ : 4. Rd5The source (Jes√∫s de la Villa) incorrectly gives 4.Ke6 Re1+ 5.Kd5 Rd1+ 6.Rd4, winning. The move 4.Ke6 wastes two moves and 6.Rd4 is illegal. and the pawn will promote. Or : 1... Kg6 : 2. Ke7?! Better is 2.Rf8 Kg7 3.Rf4!, back to a bridge on the fourth rank. : 2... Kxf5! : 3. d8=Q and White has a winning (but difficult) queen versus rook endgame (see pawnless chess endgame) . Alternate plan for the defense Alternative approaches are no better for Black. After 1.Rd1+ Ke7 2.Rd4 above, after : 2... Rb2 for example, White can still carry out his plan as above, or he can win with the simple : 3. Ra4 Kd7 : 4. Ka8 (or 4.Ka7) Kc7 : 5. Rc4+ which chases the black king away and allows the pawn to promote. (Or, 5.b8=Q+ Rxb8 6.Rc4+ wins the rook.) Rook pawn The Lucena method also works with a rook pawn if the white rook is already on the fourth rank, the black rook is not on the file adjacent to the pawn, and White is to move. Otherwise, the defending king must be cut off four files from the pawn, as in the diagram. This is not a true Lucena position since the king is cut off by more than one file. White wins: : 1. Rc1 Ke7 : 2. Rc8 Kd6! : 3. Rb8 Ra2 : 4. Kb7 Rb2+ : 5. Kc8 Rc2+ : 6. Kd8 Rh2! : 7. Rb6+ Kc5 : 8. Rc6+! Kxc6 : 9. a8=Q+ and White has a won queen versus rook endgame ‚Äì one that is easier to win than one where the rook is close to its king . Some exceptions Not all similar positions are wins. In this position, Black draws because he can safely check from the side. For this defense to work, there must be at least three files between the defending rook and the attacking king, and the defending king must be positioned such that it does not block the checks; that is, the defending king is on the \\"short side\\" of the pawn (the one with fewer files between the pawn and the edge of the board) . (See the \\"short-side defense\\" at rook and pawn versus rook endgame for more details.) Examples from praxis ;Rice versus Snape In this 2000 game between Rice and Ian Snape, Black uses the above procedure: :81... Re7+ :82. Kd2 Re5! :83. Rg8 Kf2 :84. Rf8+ Kg3 :85. Rg8+ Kf3 Here White deviates from the above: :86. Kd1 Re4 White resigns, but the alternative is: :86. Rf8+ Kg4 :87. Rg8+ Rg5 and Black wins . ;Andersson versus √Ökesson In this position from a 1999 game between Ulf Andersson and Ralf √Ökesson, White exchanges pawns in order to get to the Lucena position.Andersson vs. √Ökesson : 79. e4! dxe4 : 80. Rxe4 Kd7 : 81. Kg6 and Black resigned. White will reach a Lucena position: 81...Rg1+ 82.Kf7 Rf1 83.f6 Rf2 84.Kg7 Rg2+ 85.Kf8 Rf2 86.f7 Rg2 (a Lucena position) 87.Rd4+ Kc7 (if 87...Ke6 then 88.Ke8 wins) 88.Ke7 Re2+ 89. Kf6 Rf2+ 90.Ke6 Re2+ 91.Kf5 Rf2+ 92.Rf4 and White wins . Conclusion Rook and pawn endgames occur quite often in chess, about eight to ten percent of all games , . This position is very important since endgames may simplify to it. As it is a known win, endgames sometimes revolve around the player with the pawn trying to reach the Lucena position and the other player trying to prevent it. There is an alternate method for winning this type of position that works only for pawns on the c-file through the f-file (see Rook and pawn versus rook endgame).

Theoretically, rounding, frontness and backness could also be used in one-dimensional vowel systems; however, vertical refers specifically to the usage of vowel height as the sole distinguishing feature. Vertical vowel systems have only been uncovered in the underlying representation of various languages' phonology. Phonetically, all known natural languages employ both front and back vowels. In a vertical vowel system, the occurrence of front vs. back vowels is however predictable, governed by one or more phonological processes. Two different diachronic mechanisms may give rise to a vertical vowel system. In some cases, the front- back distinction may simply be lost when vowels are merged. This has occurred in Wichita, in which an old vowel (preserved in the related language Pawnee) has merged with . However, the Wichita vowel system is not phonetically vertical, as is realised as open back, as open-mid front, and as close to close-mid front; hence, the feature [¬± back] is relevant to the phonetics of the language, even though it is not a salient phonological distinction. Similarly, the vowel is heard in Wichita utterances, although this vowel is usually the phonetic result of a contraction of sequences of [short vowel + w + short vowel], a phenomenon also noted in other languages with vertical vowel systems. More striking is a phenomenon whereby one or more phonological features of vowels are lost and reassigned to the consonants at the syllable periphery, leaving all vowels underspecified for frontness, rounding, or both. This has occurred in Arrernte, in which vowel rounding has been lost and consonantal labialisation gained as a result; famously, in all members of the Northwest Caucasian family, both rounding and frontness have been reassigned to the syllable periphery, the former surfacing as consonantal labialisation, and the latter as palatalisation. This has also occurred in Marshallese. Some argue that the short vowels of Irish have similarly lost their frontness specification, forming a rudimentary vertical system. However, almost all Irish consonants appear in palatalised and non-palatalised forms, so the loss of frontness specification is viewed as a consequence, rather than a cause, of consonant palatalisation. Furthermore, the loss of frontness specification in Irish is limited to the short vowels of the language; the long vowels of Irish retain a front-back distinction. Marshallese also has front-back distinction for its long vowels, but these are phonemically sequences of where is a semiconsonant; for example, ' \\"rose\\" is broadly , but more narrowly . Zero- dimensional vowel systems, with one phonemic vowel only, have been postulated for Nux√°lk, Kabardian and some Abkhaz dialects, as well as several Central Chadic languages such as Moloko. A phonological analysis with no phonemic vowels at all has been shown to be possible for Mofu-Gudur. Vertical vowel systems, invariably contrasting only in vowel height, have been noted for the following languages: * Northwest Caucasian ** Abkhaz (two degrees) ** Adyghe (three degrees) ** Kabardian (two, perhaps three degrees) ** Ubykh (two, perhaps three degrees) * Caddoan ** Wichita (three degrees) *Pama-Nyungan **Arrernte (two degrees) * Austronesian ** Marshallese (four degrees) * Sepik‚ÄìRamu languages * Goidelic ** Irish (three degrees for short vowels only) * Sinitic ** Mandarin Chinese (two degrees, according to some analyses) Kazakh, Mongolian and Tundra Nenets have vowel systems resembling a vertical vowel system in that backness is not phonemic; however, they are not one- dimensional. Backness has in Kazakh and Mongolian been reinterpreted as advanced tongue root, while in Tundra Nenets backness is determined according to the palatalization of adjacent consonants. Vowels are otherwise distinguished, in addition to height, by diphthongization and, in Kazakh and Tundra Nenets, rounding. Vowel prosody system Complex interaction between a vertical vowel system and vowel harmony, known as a vowel prosody system, appears in many of the Central Chadic languages. One of the best known cases is Margi, but the phenomenon has been documented in more than thirty languages of the group altogether, including all or most languages of five geographically adjacent subgroups: * Daba group: Buwal, Daba, Mbudum, Mina * Hurza group: Mbuko, Vame * Musgum group: Mbara, Muskum * Mafa group: Cuvok, Mafa * Mofu group: Dugwor, Gemzek, Mada, Merey, Mofu-Gudur, Moloko, Muyang, Ouldeme, Zulgo Further examples of the system of the appear in e.g. Gidar and Podoko. A typical feature for these languages is that vowel frontness or roundedness cannot be considered a segmental feature but is instead a suprasegmental feature, spanning an entire morpheme or phonological word.

It was published posthumously in 1681. This poem is considered one of Marvell's finest and is possibly the best recognised carpe diem poem in English. Although the date of its composition is not known, it may have been written in the early 1650s. At that time, Marvell was serving as a tutor to the daughter of the retired commander of the New Model Army, Sir Thomas Fairfax.Lee, Michelle. \\"To His Coy Mistress by Andrew Marvell.\\" Poetry Criticism. Detroit: Gale, Cengage Learning, 2008. 171-282. Gale.cengage.com: Literature Criticism Online. Web. 20 Oct 2011. Synopsis The speaker of the poem starts by addressing a woman who has been slow to respond to his romantic advances. In the first stanza he describes how he would pay court to her if he were to be unencumbered by the constraints of a normal lifespan. He could spend centuries admiring each part of her body and her resistance to his advances (i.e., coyness) would not discourage him. In the second stanza, he laments how short human life is. Once life is over, the speaker contends, the opportunity to enjoy one another is gone, as no one embraces in death. In the last stanza, the speaker urges the woman to requite his efforts, and argues that in loving one another with passion they will both make the most of the brief time they have to live. Structure The poem is written in iambic tetrameter and rhymes in couplets. The first verse paragraph (\\"Had we...\\") is ten couplets long, the second (\\"But...\\") six, and the third (\\"Now therefore...\\") seven. The logical form of the poem runs: if... but... therefore.... Critical reception and themes Until recently, \\"To His Coy Mistress\\" had been received by many as a poem that follows the traditional conventions of carpe diem love poetry. Some modern critics, however, argue Marvell's use of complex and ambiguous metaphors challenges the perceived notions of the poem. It as well raises suspicion of irony and deludes the reader with its inappropriate and jarring imagery.Person, James E. \\"Andrew Marvell(1621-1678).\\" Literature Criticism from 1400 to 1800. Detroit: Gale Research, 1986. 391-451. Gale.cengage.com: Literature Criticism Online. Web. 20 Oct 2011. Some critics believe the poem is an ironic statement on sexual seduction. They reject the idea that Marvell's poem carries a serious and solemn mood. Rather, the poem's opening lines‚Äî\\"Had we but world enough, and time/ This coyness, Lady, were no crime\\"‚Äîseems to suggest quite a whimsical tone of regret. In the second part of the poem, there is a sudden transition into imagery that involves graves, marble vaults and worms. The narrator's use of such metaphors to depict a realistic and harsh death that awaits the lovers seems to be a way of shocking the lady into submission. As well, critics note the sense of urgency of the narrator in the poem's third section, especially the alarming comparison of the lovers to \\"amorous birds of prey\\". Allusions in other works At least two poets have taken up the challenge of responding to Marvell's poem in the character of the lady so addressed. Annie Finch's \\"Coy Mistress\\"Coy Mistress, Poetry Foundation suggests that poetry is a more fitting use of their time than lovemaking, while A.D. Hope's \\"His Coy Mistress to Mr. Marvell\\" turns down the offered seduction outright.His Coy Mistress to Mr. Marvell, Australian Poetry Library Many authors have borrowed the phrase \\"World enough and time\\" from the poem's opening line to use in their book titles. The most famous is Robert Penn Warren's 1950 novel World Enough and Time: A Romantic Novel, about murder in early-19th-century Kentucky. With variations, it has also been used for books on the philosophy of physics (World Enough and Space-Time: Absolute versus Relational Theories of Space and Time), geopolitics (World Enough and Time: Successful Strategies for Resource Management), a science-fiction collection (Worlds Enough & Time: Five Tales of Speculative Fiction), and a biography of the poet (World Enough and Time: The Life of Andrew Marvell). The phrase is used as a title chapter in Andreas Wagner's pop science book on the origin of variation in organisms, \\"Arrival of the Fittest\\". The verse serves as an epigraph to Mimesis, literary critic Erich Auerbach's most famous book. It is also the title of an episode of Big Finish Productions's The Diary of River Song series 2, and of part 1 of Doctor Who's Series 10 finale. Also in the field of science fiction, Ursula K. Le Guin wrote a Hugo-nominated short story whose title, \\"Vaster than Empires and More Slow\\", is taken from the poem. Ian Watson notes the debt of this story to Marvell, \\"whose complex and allusive poems are of a later form of pastoral to that which I shall refer, and, like Marvell, Le Guin's nature references are, as I want to argue, \\"pastoral\\" in a much more fundamental and interesting way than this simplistic use of the term.\\"\\"The Forest as Metaphor for Mind: 'The Word for World is Forest' and 'Vaster Than Empires and More Slow'\\" (in: Science Fiction Studies, November 1975) - online: \\"Ursula Le Guin and Pastoral Mode\\"; Rich Erlich: Study Guide for Ursula K. Le Guin's The Word for World Is Forest \\"Note allusion of Andrew Marvell's poem, \\"To His Coy Mistress,\\" the source of the title to Le Guin's \\"Vaster than Empires.\\"\\" There are other allusions to the poem in the field of Fantasy and Science Fiction: the first book of James Kahn's \\"New World Series\\" is titled \\"World Enough, and Time\\"; the third book of Joe Haldeman's \\"Worlds\\" trilogy is titled \\"Worlds Enough and Time\\"; and Peter S. Beagle's novel A Fine and Private Place about a love affair between two ghosts in a graveyard. The latter phrase has been widely used as a euphemism for the grave, and has formed the title of several mystery novels. Brian Aldiss's novel Hothouse, set in a distant future in which the earth is dominated by plant life, opens with \\"My vegetable love should grow / vaster than empires, and more slow.\\" Sir Terry Pratchett opens his poem An Ode to Multiple Universes with \\"I do have worlds enough and time / to spare an hour to find a rhyme / to take a week to pen an article / a day to find a rhyme for ‚Äòparticle‚Äô.\\" The phrase \\"there will be time\\" occurs repeatedly in a section of T. S. Eliot's \\"The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock\\" (1915), and is often said to be an allusion to Marvell's poem. Prufrock says that there will be time \\"for the yellow smoke that slides along the street\\", time \\"to murder and create\\", and time \\"for a hundred indecisions ... Before the taking of a toast and tea\\". As Eliot's hero is, in fact, putting off romance and consummation, he is (falsely) answering Marvell's speaker. Eliot also alludes to the lines near the end of Marvell's poem, \\"Let us roll all our strength and all / Our sweetness up into one ball\\", with his lines, \\"To have squeezed the universe into a ball / To roll it toward some overwhelming question,\\" as Prufrock questions whether or not such an act of daring would have been worth it. Eliot returns to Marvell in The Waste Land with the lines \\"But at my back in a cold blast I hear / The rattle of the bones\\" (Part III, line 185) and \\"But at my back from time to time I hear / The sound of horns and motors\\" (Part III, line 196). The line \\"deserts of vast eternity\\" is used in the novel Orlando: A Biography, by Virginia Woolf, which was published in 1928. Archibald MacLeish's poem \\"\\",\\"You, Andrew Marvell\\", by Archibald MacLeish, at the Poetry FoundationOn Becoming a Poet, from The Weather of Words, by Mark Strand alludes to the passage of time and to the growth and decline of empires. In his poem, the speaker, lying on the ground at sunset, feels \\"the rising of the night\\". He visualizes sunset, moving from east to west geographically, overtaking the great civilizations of the past, and feels \\"how swift how secretly / The shadow of the night comes on.\\" B. F. Skinner quotes \\"But at my back I always hear / Time's wing√®d chariot hurrying near\\", through his character Professor Burris in Walden Two, who is in a confused mood of desperation, lack of orientation, irresolution and indecision. (Prentice Hall 1976, Chapter 31, p. 266). This line is also quoted in Ernest Hemingway's novel A Farewell to Arms, as in Arthur C. Clarke's short story, The Ultimate Melody. The same line appears in full in the opening minutes of Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger's A Matter of Life and Death (1946), spoken by the protagonist, pilot and poet Peter Carter: 'But at my back I always hear / Time's wing√®d chariot hurrying near; And yonder all before us lie / Deserts of vast eternity. Andy Marvell, What a Marvel'. The line \\"A fine and private place, but none, I think, do there embrace\\" appears in Stephen King's novel Pet Sematary. One of the Flavia de Luce novels by Alan Bradley is titled ‚Äúthe Grave‚Äôs a Fine and Private Place‚Äù. The line \\"My vegetable love should grow / Vaster than empires, and more slow\\" is quoted by William S. Burroughs in the last entry of his diary (July 29, 1997). The line \\"I would Love you ten years before the Flood, And you should, if you please, refuse Till the conversion of the Jews. My vegetable love should grow Vaster than empires, and more slow.\\" Is used as the preamble to part three of Greg Bear's Nebula award winning novel Moving Mars. In The Time Traveler's Wife, by Audrey Niffenegger, one of the main characters, Henry, raises a toast \\"To world enough, and time,\\" early in the book, foreshadowing his death near the end of the book where he recites this same phrase to his wife as his last words. \\"Le char ail√© du Temps\\" (Time's winged chariot) is the French translation (by Bernard Sigaud, 2013) of a short story by Nina Allan (2009), whose original title is just \\"Time's Chariot\\".

Life and career His father was the Canadian-American philosopher Roy Wood Sellars, a leading American philosophical naturalist in the first half of the twentieth-century. Wilfrid was educated at the University of Michigan (BA, 1933), the University at Buffalo, and Oriel College, Oxford (1934‚Äì1937), where he was a Rhodes Scholar, obtaining his highest earned degree, an MA, in 1940. During World War II, he served in military intelligence. He then taught at the University of Iowa (1938‚Äì1946), the University of Minnesota (1947‚Äì1958), Yale University (1958‚Äì1963), and from 1963 until his death, at the University of Pittsburgh. He served as president of the Metaphysical Society of America in 1977. He was a founder of the journal Philosophical Studies. Sellars is well known as a critic of foundationalist epistemology‚Äîthe \\"Myth of the Given\\" as he called it. However, his philosophical works are more generally directed toward the ultimate goal of reconciling intuitive ways of describing the world (both those of common sense and traditional philosophy) with a thoroughly naturalist, scientific account of reality. He is widely regarded both for great sophistication of argument and for his assimilation of many and diverse subjects in pursuit of a synoptic vision. Sellars was perhaps the first philosopher to synthesize elements of American pragmatism with elements of British and American analytic philosophy and Austrian and German logical positivism. His work also reflects a sustained engagement with the German tradition of transcendental idealism, most obviously in his book Science and Metaphysics: Kantian Variations. Philosophical work Sellars coined certain now-common idioms in philosophy, such as the \\"space of reasons\\". This idiom refers to two things. It: # Describes the conceptual and behavioral web of language that humans use to get intelligently around their world, # Denotes the fact that talk of reasons, epistemic justification, and intention is not the same as, and cannot necessarily be mapped onto, talk of causes and effects in the sense that physical science speaks of them. Note: (2) corresponds in part to the distinction Sellars makes between the manifest image and the scientific image. =\\"Empiricism and the Philosophy of Mind\\"= Sellars's most famous work is the lengthy and difficult paper, \\"Empiricism and the Philosophy of Mind\\" (1956). In it, he criticises the view that knowledge of what we perceive can be independent of the conceptual processes which result in perception. He named this \\"The Myth of the Given,\\" attributing it to phenomenology and sense- data theories of knowledge. The work targets several theories at once, especially C. I. Lewis' Kantian pragmatism and Rudolf Carnap's positivism. He draws out \\"The Myth of Jones,\\" to defend the possibility of a strict behaviorist worldview. The parable explains how thoughts, intelligent action, and even subjective inner experience can be attributed to people within a scientific model. Sellars used a fictional tribe, the \\"Ryleans,\\" since he wanted to address Gilbert Ryle's The Concept of Mind. Sellars's idea of \\"myth\\", heavily influenced by Ernst Cassirer, is not necessarily negative. He saw it as something that can be useful or otherwise, rather than true or false. He aimed to unite the conceptual behavior of the \\"space of reasons\\" with the concept of a subjective sense experience. This was one of his most central goals, which his later work described as Kantian. =\\"The Language of Theories\\"= In his paper, \\"Empiricism and the Philosophy of Mind\\" (1961), Sellars introduces the concept of Kantian empiricism. Kantian empiricism features a distinction between (1) claims whose revision requires abandonment or modification of the system of concepts in terms of which they are framed (i.e., modification of the fallible set of constitutive principles underlying knowledge, otherwise known as framework-relative a priori truths) and (2) claims revisable on the basis of observations formulated in terms of a system of concepts which remained fixed throughout. =\\"Philosophy and the Scientific Image of Man\\"= In his \\"Philosophy and the Scientific Image of Man\\" (1962), Sellars distinguishes between the \\"manifest image\\" and the \\"scientific image\\" of the world. The manifest image includes intentions, thoughts, and appearances. Sellars allows that the manifest image may be refined through 'correlational induction', but he rules out appeal to imperceptible entities. The scientific image describes the world in terms of the theoretical physical sciences. It includes notions such as causality and theories about particles and forces. The two images sometimes complement one another, and sometimes conflict. For example, the manifest image includes practical or moral claims, whereas the scientific image does not. There is conflict, e.g. where science tells us that apparently solid objects are mostly empty space. Sellars favours a synoptic vision, wherein the scientific image takes ultimate precedence in cases of conflict, at least with respect to empirical descriptions and explanations.Brassier, Ray, Nihil Unbound (2007) p.3 Founder of cooperative housing for students As a student at the University of Michigan, Wilfrid Sellars was one of the founding members of the first North-American cooperative house for university students, which was then called \\"Michigan Socialist House\\" (and which was later renamed \\"Michigan Cooperative House\\"). Legacy Robert Brandom, his junior colleague at Pittsburgh, named Sellars and Willard Van Orman Quine as the two most profound and important philosophers of their generation. Sellars's goal of a synoptic philosophy that unites the everyday and scientific views of reality is the foundation and archetype of what is sometimes called the Pittsburgh School, whose members include Brandom, John McDowell, and John Haugeland.Chauncey Maher, The Pittsburgh School of Philosophy. Routledge. 2012. Especially Brandom introduced a Hegelian variety of the Pittsburgh School, often called analytic Hegelianism.Robert Brandom, A Spirit of Trust: A Reading of Hegel's Phenomenology, Harvard University Press, 2019.deVries, Willem A. \\"Hegel's Revival in Analytic Philosophy\\". In: The Oxford Handbook of Hegel. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2017. pp. 743‚Äì766: \\"Analytic philosophy is rediscovering Hegel. [There is] a particularly strong thread of new analytic Hegelianism, sometimes called 'Pittsburgh Hegelianism' ... The sociality and historicity of reason, the proper treatment of space and time, conceptual holism, inferentialism, the reality of conceptual structure, the structure of experience, and the nature of normativity are the central concerns of Pittsburgh Hegelianism.\\" Other philosophers strongly influenced by Sellars span the full spectrum of contemporary English-speaking philosophy, from neopragmatism (Richard Rorty) to eliminative materialism (Paul Churchland) to rationalism (Laurence BonJour). Sellars's philosophical heirs also include Ruth Millikan, H√©ctor-Neri Casta√±eda, Bruce Aune, Jay Rosenberg, Johanna Seibt, Matthew Burstein, Ray Brassier, Andrew Chrucky, Jeffrey Sicha, Pedro Amaral, Thomas Vinci, Willem A. de Vries, David Rosenthal, Ken Wilber and Michael Williams.

It is named variously for businessman Samuel Waldo, who eventually gained control of the patent, and for the Muscongus River, one of the grant's boundaries. History In March 1630, John Beauchamp of London, England, and Thomas Leverett of Boston, England, obtained a grant of land from a company acting under the authority of the government of England. This grant was first known as the Muscongus Patent from the Muscongus River that formed a part of the western boundary. From the seacoast, it extended northerly between Penobscot Bay and the Penobscot River on the east, and the Muscongus River on the west, to the line that now constitutes the southern boundary of the towns Hampden, Newburgh and Dixmont. This grant or patent conveyed nothing but the right of exclusive trade with the Native Americans-- perhaps the Penobscot or Abenaki peoples--for which a trading house was built and supplied with such articles of exchange as were necessary to successful traffic. Trade was carried on without interruption to the mutual advantage of the European-American settlers and natives until the opening of the first Indian Wars in 1675, a period of 45 years. After 1675, the patent lay dormant until 1719 when Leverett's great-grandson, John Leverett, President of Harvard College, revived the ancient claim and formed the Lincolnshire Proprietors, also known as the Ten Proprietors, so named for the ten shares distributed, one to each member. Samuel Waldo of Boston acquired a controlling interest in the patent in 1729 and it henceforward become known as the Waldo Patent.Joseph Williamson, ‚ÄúBrigadier-General Samuel Waldo,‚Äù Collections of the Maine Historical Society, Vol. IX (Portland: Maine Historical Society, 1887), p. 77.R.H. Howard and Henry E. Crocker, ed., A History of New England: Containing Historical and Descriptive Sketches of the Counties, Cities, and Principal Towns of the Six New England States, Vol. 2, Maine, New Hampshire, and Vermont (Boston: Crocker and Company, Publishers, 1881), p. 122. General Samuel Waldo was proprietor of the Waldo Patent. He is said to have gone to Europe to recruit German immigrants to settle his 576,000 acre (2,331 km¬≤) grant, which included parts of what are now Waldo, Penobscot and Lincoln counties and all of Knox County, Maine, along with the islands within three miles of its border. In 1759, Waldo accompanied the governor of the Province of Massachusetts Bay, Thomas Pownall, and his 400 men to help establish this site. To open the Penobscot River area to settlement, the governor selected Fort Point in Stockton Springs to build a breastwork and blockhouse. Called Fort Pownall, the fort included a trading post. But Waldo died on May 23 near present-day Bangor while exploring the northern reaches of his property. He was buried without monument at Fort Point. Ownership of the Waldo Patent then transferred to his heirs, who included the Fluckers of Boston. Lucy Flucker married Henry Knox, who served as a general in the American Revolutionary War, and the Knoxes eventually acquired most of the patent. Much of their land was eventually sold to William Bingham, leading those lands to become known as the Bingham Purchase.

In October 2003, he became the first person sent into space by the Chinese space program. This mission, Shenzhou 5, made China the third country to independently send humans into space. Background Yang was born in Suizhong County, Huludao, Liaoning province. His mother was a teacher, and his father was an accountant at a state agricultural firm. Yang Liwei's wife is also a People's Liberation Army (PLA) officer, with whom he has a son. In 1983, he was admitted to the Number 2 PLAAF Flight Academy (Á©∫ÂÜõÁ¨¨‰∫åÈ£ûË°åÂ≠¶Èô¢) and graduated four years later. He participated in the screening process for astronauts in 1996.Seedhouse, Erik (2009). \\"The New Space Race: China vs. USA\\". Springer. . In the PLAAF, he logged 1350 hours of flight time as a fighter pilot before he went to space training. Spaceflight career Yang was selected as an astronaut candidate in 1998 and has trained for space flight since then. He was chosen from the final pool of 13 candidates to fly on China's first manned space mission. A former fighter pilot in the Aviation Military Unit of the PLA, he held the rank of Lieutenant Colonel at the time of his mission. He was promoted to full Colonel on 20 October 2003. According to the Youth Daily, the decision had been made in advance of his spaceflight, but Yang was not made aware of it. He was launched into space aboard his Shenzhou 5 spacecraft atop a Long March 2F rocket from Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center at 09:00 CST (01:00 UTC) on 15 October 2003. Prior to his launch almost nothing was made public about the Chinese astronaut candidates; his selection for the Shenzhou 5 launch was only leaked to the media one day before the launch. Yang Liwei has reported the apparition of abnormal vibrations 120 seconds after launch, he described as \\"very uncomfortable\\". As a consequence, corrective measures were swiftly taken to the design of the following CZ-2F carrier rocket for the Shenzhou-6. Yang punctuated his journey with regular updates on his condition‚Äîvariations of \\"I feel good\\", the last coming as the capsule floated to the ground after re- entry. He spoke to his wife as the Shenzhou 5 started its eighth circuit around the Earth, assuring her from space: \\"I feel very good, don't worry\\". He ate specially designed packets of shredded pork with garlic, Kung Pao chicken and eight treasure rice, along with Chinese herbal tea. In the middle of the journey, state television broadcast footage of Yang waving a small flag of the People's Republic of China and that of the United Nations inside his capsule. State media said Yang's capsule was supplied with a gun, a knife and tent in case he landed in the wrong place. Yang's craft landed in the grasslands of the Chinese region of Inner Mongolia at around 06:30 CST on October 16, 2003 (22:00 UTC), having completed 14 orbits and travelled more than 600,000 km. Yang left the capsule about 15 minutes after landing, and was congratulated by Premier Wen Jiabao. But the astronaut's bleeding lips seen in the official images broadcast sparked rumours of a hard landing confirmed by accounts of personnel present at the landing site. Although the first Chinese citizen in space, Yang Liwei is not the first person of Chinese origin in space. Shanghai-born Taylor Wang flew on Space Shuttle mission STS-51-B in 1985. Wang, however, had become a United States citizen in 1975. Yang visited Hong Kong on 31 October 2003, holding talks and sharing his experiences during a six-day stay in the territory. The visit coincided with an exhibition that featured his reentry capsule, spacesuit and leftover food from his 21-hour mission. On November 5, he travelled to Macau. On 7 November, Yang received the title of \\"Space Hero\\" from Jiang Zemin, the Chairman of the PRC Central Military Commission (CMC). He also received a badge of honour during a ceremony at the Great Hall of the People. Russia awarded him the Gagarin medal.China Daily. http://www2.chinadaily.com.cn/english/doc/2005-08/20/content_470775.htm The Chinese University of Hong Kong has given Yang an honorary doctorate. The asteroid 21064 Yangliwei and the fossil bird Dalingheornis liweii are named after him.Zhang, Z., Hou, L., Hasegawa, Y., O'Connor, J., Martin, L.D. and Chiappe, L.M. (2006). \\"The first Mesozoic heterodactyl bird from China.\\" Acta Geologica Sinica, 80(5): 631-635. After Shenzhou 5 In a move similar to that taken by the Soviet Union with national space flight hero Yuri Gagarin, an official decision to no longer assign him to spaceflight missions was made. Yang was promoted to Major General on 22 July 2008. Yang became the alternate member of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China at the 17th Party Congress in October 2007. The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization awarded the UNESCO Medal on Space Science to Yang in October 2017.

The Shenzhou spacecraft was launched on a Long March 2F launch vehicle. There had been four previous flights of uncrewed Shenzhou missions since 1999. China became the third country in the world to have independent human spaceflight capability after the Soviet Union (later, Russia) and the United States.  Crew  Yang Liwei became the first man sent into space by the Chinese space program.  Mission parameters  * Mass: 7,890 kg * Perigee: 332 km * Apogee: 336 km * Inclination: 42.4¬∞ * Period: 91.2 minutes * NSSDC ID: 2003-045A Mission highlights Shenzhou 5 was launched at 09:00 (UTC +8) from Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center, a launch base in the Gobi Desert in Gansu Province, entering orbit 343 km above Earth at 09:10 (UTC +8) with astronaut Yang Liwei (Êù®Âà©‰ºü), a 38 year-old Lieutenant Colonel in the People's Liberation Army and former fighter pilot. The launch made China the third country to independently launch a person into space, after the Soviet Union and the United States. The launch of the Shenzhou was the result of a manned space program which began in 1992. Neither the launch nor the reentry was televised live, and it is widely believed that it was because of government fears that a disaster could create an embarrassment, but the time of both launch and reentry had been widely announced beforehand, and news appeared on Chinese Central Television within minutes after both events. This placed the level of secrecy associated with the Shenzhou 5 mission between American and Soviet practices. In contrast to American practice, foreign journalists were not admitted and live television was not broadcast; in contrast to Soviet practice, the fact that a launch was about to occur was announced days in advance and photos and video from the mission were available within minutes of launch and reentry. =Orbital spaceflight= The Shenzhou spacecraft made 14 orbits and landed 21 hours after launch. It re-entered Earth's atmosphere at 06:04 (UTC +8) on October 16, 2003 (22:04 UTC 15 Oct 2003), its parachute opened normally and the astronaut said he was feeling fine. The landing happened at 06:28 (UTC +8), just 4.8 kilometers from the planned landing site in Inner Mongolia, according to the government. The orbital module of the spacecraft stayed in orbit; it continued with automated experiments until March 16, 2004, and decayed on May 30.SeeSat-L May-04 : Shenzou OM decayed Premier Wen Jiabao congratulated the country's first person in space after his safe return to Earth. Y√°ng emerged from the capsule about 15 minutes later and waved to members of the recovery team. The control center in Beijing later declared China's first crewed spacecraft mission to be successful after Yang Liwei emerged from his capsule. =Y√°ng's experience in space= During the flight Y√°ng wore diapers. When questioned about his experience aboard Shenzhou 5 he stated \\"Better not to piss in diaper...Baby doesn't like it, neither does an adult.\\" Ever since official images taken after the landing revealed that the astronaut had an injured lower lip, rumours of a hard landing have circulated in China, and may have been leaked by personnel present at the landing site. In addition, Yang reported abnormal vibrations that appeared 120 seconds after launch (pogo oscillation), which he described as \\"very uncomfortable.\\" As a consequence, corrective measures were taken to the design of the following CZ-2F carrier rocket for the Shenzhou 6 flight.  Politics  The launch was widely heralded in the official Chinese state media with newspapers devoting far more space to the launch than any recent event. While the Chinese media portrayed the launch as a triumph for Chinese science and technology and a milestone for Chinese nationalism, it has also been pointed out in both Chinese and Western media that Yang Liwei showed the flag of the United Nations in addition to the flag of the People's Republic of China. The state media also reported that crop seeds from Taiwan were brought aboard the spacecraft. General Secretary and President Hu Jintao, in an official celebration at the Great Hall of the People, hailed China's success in launching its first crewed spacecraft into orbit, describing it as \\"an honor for our great motherland, an indicator for the initial victory of the country's first crewed space flight and for an historic step taken by the Chinese people in their endeavor to surmount the peak of the world's science and technology.\\" Hu added, \\"the Party and the people will never forget those who have set up this outstanding merit in the space industry for the motherland, the people and the nation.\\" He also expressed congratulations and respect to specialists and people who have contributed to China's space mission development on behalf of the CPC Central Committee, the State Council and the Central Military Commission (CMC). The launch was met with praise from around the world. For example, Prime Minister of Japan Junichiro Koizumi called the launch \\"a great feat\\". United States President George W. Bush congratulated Chinese President Hu and wished China continued success.https://fas.org/sgp/crs/space/RS21641.pdf U.S. State Department spokesman said that the United States wished to \\"applaud China's success in becoming only the third country to launch people into space\\". NASA Administrator Sean O'Keefe called Shenzhou 5 an \\"important achievement in human exploration\\" and wished China \\"a continued safe human space flight program.\\" The spacecraft has since featured prominently in festivities and celebrations not only in China but also in foreign countries, such as official North Korean commemorative stamps showing the first Chinese crewed spacecraft alongside the DPRK's first satellite Kwangmy≈èngs≈èng-1.

Drawing by Eloy Palacios (1912) Street musicians in Caracas play joropo on the Venezuelan arpa Interpretation of joropo in Caracas, Venezuela The joropo', also called ' (Spanish for \\"music of the Llanos\\"), is a musical style resembling the fandango, and an accompanying dance. It originated in Venezuelan and Colombian territory, and has African, Native South American, and European influences. There are different joropo variants: tuyero, oriental, and llanero.Shepherd, John and Horn, David. Bloomsbury Encyclopedia of Popular Music of the World, Volume 9: Genres: Caribbean and Latin, pp. 400‚Äì402 (Bloomsbury Publishing 2014). It is a fundamental genre of Venezuelan m√∫sica criolla (creole music). It is also the most popular \\"folk rhythm\\": the well-known song \\"Alma Llanera\\" is a joropo, considered the unofficial national anthem of Venezuela. In 1882 it became Venezuela's national dance. Formerly, the Spanish word meant \\"a party\\", but now it has come to mean a type of music and dance that identifies Venezuelans. In the 18th century, the llaneros started using the word instead of the word , which was used at the time for party and dance.  Venezuela  = Tuyero = Central joropo () is also known as (\\"Tuyan\\"), (\\"Tuyan joropo\\") or (\\"Tuyan beat\\"). Characteristic of the central states of Venezuela, like Aragua and Miranda, eastern Carabobo and northern Guarico, central joropo, or tuyero (as practiced in the Valles del Tuy along the Tuy River) is sung accompanied by harp (, sometimes replaced by guitar) and maracas. Unlike the nylon strings of the llanera harp, the central joropo harp also uses metal strings, which gave its unique sound. The central joropo singer also plays the maracas and dances, requiring just two performers: the harpist, and the singer-maraquero. Joropo harpists prefer the name \\"arpisto\\" rather than , the usual Spanish word for \\"harpist\\". The central joropo him the same considerations are applied around the passage and hit burrowing joropo, except speed, which is slightly lower. Another important distinction is that the central joropo revuelta, kind of colonial origin is present, basically consists of a chain of musical sections of fixed forms, in the same tone as a Baroque suite, without interruption, but with surprising twists. The movements of the revuelta are called passage; input or call Yaguazo, Yaguazo, and Marisela Guabina input. Sometimes they can call Marisela added to them, and even a small coda. The revuelta is thus equivalent to the batch or shift dance, and its length is probably the reason for its gradual decline in use, being replaced by the execution of the parts in isolation. The arrangement of these sections is of sequential nature, unlike golpes of Llanero joropo, having a cyclic condition. The most characteristic part of tuyero joropo, the Tuyera Revuelta consists of four sections: the exhibition (passage), development (yaguazo and guabina), the instrumental coda named Marisela, and an end known as \\"monkey call.\\" They are central joropo own beats flowers and quitapesares. The most famous passages tuyeros are The Hermit Mario Diaz, Dawn tuyero of Cipriano Moreno and Pablo Hidalgo, and El gato enmochilado (Cat in a bag) by Fulgencio Aquino. Caraque√±os and central musicians adopted central joropo as inspiration for their works, as in the case of Marisela (Sebasti√°n D√≠az Pe√±a), the Alma Llanera (Pedro Elias Gutierrez), the waltz Quitapesares (Carlos Bonet) and even Creole Sonatina Juan Bautista Square. Central joropo lyrics are of a sly, sardonic nature, in contrast to the forceful and violent own burrowing joropo, whose contrapunteos (counterpoints) end up not infrequently in sets and fights. The most characteristic of tuyero folklore piece, \\"The Tuyero Revolt\\" (\\"Revuelta tuyera\\"), consists of four sections: the exhibition (passage), development (yaguaso and guabina), the instrumental coda (\\"Marisela\\") and an end known as \\"the call monkey\\". The most famous tuyero passages are \\"El ermita√±o\\" of Mario Diaz, \\"Amanecer tuyero\\" of Cipriano Moreno and Pablo Hidalgo, and \\"El gato enmochilado\\" of Fulgencio Aquino. = East joropo = Characteristic of the northeastern region of Venezuela, specifically of Sucre, Nueva Esparta and Anzoategui and Monagas Northern states. In this particular type of joropo melodic instrument par excellence is the mandolin. However, the eastern mandolin (eight nylon strings), violin, harmonica and a small accordion called \\"cuereta\\" also have a major role in the oriental musical folklore. The so-called \\"joropo with refrain\\" consists of two sections: the first section or \\"hit\\" is traditionally a fixed melody in rhythm that is repeated two or more times; the second section or \\"chorus\\" is an improvised melody over a fixed harmonic rhythm cycle is . Note that in the eastern joropo, cuatro and maracas are executed in a much freer and more complex than in the rest of Venezuelans joropos way. Likewise, it is important to mention that the musical tradition of the eastern region of Venezuela has many other forms besides the eastern joropo. = Guayan√©s joropo = Product of the interaction of llaneros and eastern Bolivar state in Venezuela , specifically in Ciudad Bolivar. It is executed with the Guyanese mandolin (eight metal strings) , cuatro and maracas. Six Guayan√©s , the Josa and Rompeluto highlight among the most famous Guyanese joropos. = Golpe tocuyano or larense joropo = Hailing from the West Central region of Venezuela , mainly states Lara, Portuguesa (Portuguese saw) and Yaracuy . Played by a variety of stringed instruments (Four , Middle Five , Five and Six) together with Tambora and Maracas produce a very particular and unique sound among other Venezuelans joropos . Celebrity tocuyanos hits are \\"Amalia Rosa\\" , \\"Montilla\\" , \\"Gavilan Tocuyano\\" and \\"Ah mundo! Barquisimeto\\" , \\"Los Dos Gavilanes\\" , \\"The Fright\\" , \\"Pajarillo Tocuyano\\" , \\"Garrote Encabullao\\" , \\"Fire Fire\\", among many others. Dancing in the number of members is six couples. = Quirpa = Legend says that this type of joropo is named after Jose Antonio Oquendo , who was nicknamed \\"Quirpa\\" . Burrowing harpist of the late nineteenth century who died of a stab wound . The quirpa uses ternary and tertiary bars and sometimes combined, with shifts of rhythm and musical accents . = Joropo llanero = Until the mid-twentieth century, and with regard to the region of the plains of Venezuela, the joropo word referring to a social event almost a fair- for a period that could vary from a few hours and even a full week. There participating local people or coming from various places, generally attracted by trade, where the central event it was the music, dance and contrapunteos. Burrowing joropo music was provided by a basic set consisting of harp, cuatro, maracas and singing. If there was no harp, it was replaced by a mandolin or violin The genera of burrowing joropo are two: Passage: the more sedate, and generally known author. Its speed is approximately 152 bpm, and harmonic structure free, usually in two parts; Y Hit:. Anonymous author, although many of these strokes are attributed to composers of the early twentieth century The coup complies with certain recognizable melodic turns on fixed characteristic harmonic patterns that define its type. Singing is syllabic, that is, to each note of the melody corresponds to a syllable. The verses are octosyllabic and sometimes five syllables, all under contrafactum, ie the replacement of new texts in existing melodies. The stroke speed is greater than the passage (176‚Äì192 bpm). When the song is a story of an event or fantasy called the RAN, equivalent to the old Spanish romance. The blows are the basis for the buzzes or hums contrapunteo that between two or more opponents. The most common are the six law (major key), the bird (in a minor key), six numbering or six numerao (with transport augmentations in fourth grade), the Kirpa or quirpa, Gavan (in modes major and minor), the San Rafael, carnival, Chipola, the catira, the buzz buzzing, among the best known. The entreverao is the aggregation of two strokes, with a modulation of each other, usually to sing two people with different tessitura voice (baritone and tenor). As for the steps of the most frequent dance are valsiao, escobillao and footwork, in which, unlike the central joropo, feet off the floor rise. Family tree of performers llanera harp in Venezuela since the late nineteenth century to the present  Bailando  The Joropo is played with the arpa llanera (harp), bandola, cuatro, and maracas (ibid), making use of polyrhythmic patterns, especially of hemiola, and alternation of and meters. It was originally played, most often also sung, by the llaneros, the Venezuelan Llanos, (plains), and thus also called m√∫sica llanera (ibid). The singer and the harp or bandola may perform the main melody while a cuatro performs the accompaniment, adding its characteristic rhythmic, sharp percussive effect. The cuatro and the bandola are four-stringed instruments which are descendants of the Spanish guitar. The only real percussion instruments used are the maracas. Besides the genre and dance, the name joropo also means the performance, the event or occasion of performance. Dancing The joropo is the most famous dance in Venezuela and is also the national dance. It is adopted and still uses the hand turn, the movement of the feet, and waltz turns. First, the partners dance a type of waltz holding each other tightly. Then they stand facing each other and make small steps forward and backward as if sweeping the floor. Lastly they hold each other's arms, and the woman does sweeping steps while the man stomps his feet along with the music's rhythm. Evolution and more refined forms In modern times, several other instruments have been added to playing various parts in joropo performances, for instance, guitar, flute, clarinet, piano, and up to a complete symphony orchestra playing joropo arrangements.

The aircraft rose to an altitude of over and floated from the point of takeoff in San Pedro, California, into and violating controlled airspace near Los Angeles International Airport. During the landing, the aircraft became entangled in power lines, but Walters was able to safely climb down. The flight attracted worldwide media attention and inspired a later movie and imitators. Background Lawrence Richard \\"Larry\\" Walters had often dreamed of flying, but was unable to become a pilot in the United States Air Force because of his poor eyesight. He first thought of using weather balloons to fly at age 13, after seeing them hanging from the ceiling of a military surplus store. He had a career as an American truck driver. In 1982, he decided to try his flying idea. His intention was to float over the Mojave Desert and then use a pellet gun to burst some of the balloons in order to land.Video; Preparation and flight In mid-1982, Walters and his girlfriend at the time, Carol Van Deusen, purchased 45 weather balloons and obtained helium tanks from California Toy Time Balloons. They used a forged requisition from his employer, FilmFair Studios, saying the balloons were for a television commercial. On July 2, 1982, Walters attached 43 of the balloons to his lawn chair, filled them with helium, put on a parachute, and strapped himself into the chair in the backyard of a home at 1633 West 7th Street in San Pedro. He took his pellet gun, a CB radio, sandwiches, beer, and a camera. When his friends cut the cord that tied his lawn chair to his Jeep, Walters's lawn chair rose rapidly to a height of about and was spotted from two commercial airliners. He slowly drifted over Long Beach and crossed the primary approach corridor of Long Beach Airport. He was in contact with REACT, a citizens band radio monitoring organization, who recorded their conversation: :REACT: What information do you wish me to tell [the airport] at this time as to your location and your difficulty? :Larry: Ah, the difficulty is, ah, this was an unauthorized balloon launch, and, uh, I know I'm in a federal airspace, and, uh, I'm sure my ground crew has alerted the proper authority. But, uh, just call them and tell them I'm okay. After 45 minutes in the sky, Walters shot several balloons, taking care not to unbalance the load. He then accidentally dropped his pellet gun overboard. He descended slowly, until the balloons' dangling cables got caught in a power line at 432 East 45th Street in Long Beach. The power line broke, causing a 20-minute electricity blackout. He landed unharmed on the ground. Aftermath Walters was immediately arrested by waiting members of the Long Beach Police Department. Regional safety inspector Neal Savoy was reported to have said, \\"We know he broke some part of the Federal Aviation Act, and as soon as we decide which part it is, some type of charge will be filed. If he had a pilot's license, we'd suspend that, but he doesn't.\\" Walters initially was fined $4,000 for violations under U.S. Federal Aviation Regulations, including operating an aircraft within an airport traffic area \\"without establishing and maintaining two-way communications with the control tower.\\" Walters appealed, and the fine was reduced to $1,500. A charge of operating a \\"civil aircraft for which there is not currently in effect an airworthiness certificate\\" was dropped, as it was not applicable to his class of aircraft. Just after landing, Walters spoke to the press, saying:[http://www.snopes.com/travel/airline/walters.asp snopes.com: Up, Up, and Away! The aircraft was dubbed Inspiration I. Lawn Chair Larry was awarded the title of \\"At-Risk Survivor\\" in the 1993 Darwin Awards. 10 days after his flight, Walters appeared on Late Night with David Letterman. He was briefly in demand as a motivational speaker, and quit his job as a truck driver. He was featured in a Timex print ad in the early 1990s, but never made much money from his fame.https://www.5280.com/2019/09/the-balloon-boy-hoax-solved/ The lawn chair used in the flight was reportedly given to an admiring boy named Jerry, though Walters regretted doing so when the Smithsonian Institution asked him to donate it to its museum. Twenty years later, Jerry sent an email to Mark Barry, a pilot who had documented Walters's story and dedicated a website to it, and identified himself. The chair was still sitting in his garage, attached to some of the original tethers and water jugs used as ballast. The chair was on loan to the San Diego Air and Space Museum, on exhibition through 2014. =Later life and death= Later in his life, Walters hiked the San Gabriel Mountains and did volunteer work for the United States Forest Service. He later broke up with his girlfriend of 15 years and could only find work sporadically as a security guard. On October 6, 1993, at the age of 44, Walters took his own life by shooting himself in the heart in Angeles National Forest. Imitators People who do cluster ballooning get inspiration from Larry Walters's experience. Walters's flight had imitators. It also spawned the extreme sport of cluster ballooning. * On New Year's Day, 1984, in Stow, Massachusetts, Kevin Walsh made a flight to with 57 helium balloons and descended by parachute. He was cited with four violations of FAA regulations and fined $4,000.http://www.clusterballoon.org/history.htm https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/up-up-and-away/ * The Guinness Book of World Records recognizes the highest altitude attained via cluster ballooning to be that achieved by Mike Howard (UK) and Steve Davis (USA), who on August 4, 2001, over Los Lunas, NM, USA, used 400 helium balloons to reach a height of over 18,300 feet (5,600 m). Larry Walters is estimated to have reached 16,000 feet (4,900 m) in 1982. His record is not recognized, however, because he did not carry a proper altimeter. * Yoshikazu Suzuki departed from Lake Biwa in Japan on 23 November 1992 with 23 helium balloons. He was spotted by a Japanese coast guard aeroplane on 25 November 1992, located about offshore over the Pacific Ocean, at an altitude between , and was never seen again. * John Ninomiya's flights have been featured on The Science Channel, The History Channel, TechTV, TLC, and MTV. * On July 7, 2007, Kent Couch, a 47-year-old American gas station owner from Bend, Oregon, reportedly flew in his lawn chair, landing in a field about NNW of North Powder, Oregon, about from the Idaho border. Traveling an average of , Couch used plastic bags filled with of water as ballast against the 105 large helium balloons tied to his lawn chair. Like Walters, Couch had a BB gun on hand to shoot the balloons in order to initiate descent. After the flight, he developed a way to release helium from the balloons, allowing for a more controlled descent.\\"Bend lawn-chair balloonist soars high on 2nd flight\\" During a second flight on July 5, 2008, Couch realized his goal of interstate travel when he landed safely in western Idaho. The trip totaled and took 9 hours and 12 minutes. * On January 13, 2008, the Brazilian Roman Catholic priest and human-rights defender Adelir Antonio de Carli lifted off from Amp√©re, Brazil, suspended under 600 helium- filled party balloons, and reached an altitude of before landing safely in Argentina. On April 20, 2008, lifting off from Paranagua, Brazil, in an attempt to fly 725 km (450 mi) inland to Dourados, Brazil, he flew using a chair suspended under 1,000 party balloons, reaching an altitude of . Not having checked the weather forecast, he got caught in a storm. He had a GPS but did not know how to operate it. He was last heard on the radio eight hours after liftoff approaching the water after flying off the coast, unable to give his position, and crashed in the Atlantic Ocean; part of his body was found by the Brazilian Navy near an offshore oil platform on July 4, 2008. The act won him a 2008 Darwin Award. * On May 28, 2010, the American adventurer Jonathan Trappe crossed the English Channel by cluster balloon, departing near Challock, England, and crossing over the White Cliffs of Dover at St. Margarets Bay. He made landfall again over Dunkirk, France, and then tracked inland, landing in a farmer's cabbage patch in France.Balloon Daredevil Floats Over English Channel , news.sky.com. Trappe continued to experiment in cluster ballooning flights. In 2011 he replicated the Up house for a National Geographic television program.BalloonSport, May‚ÄìJune 2011 In September 2013, he tried to cross the Atlantic, but after taking off in Maine he landed in Canada after being unable to control his balloon. * On June 8, 2013, Joe Barbera, of La Center, WA launched a lawn chair with cluster balloons and recorded a new altitude record of 21,194 feet (6,460 m). This is a pending world record being considered by Guinness Book of World Records. * On July 6, 2015, Daniel Boria of Calgary, Canada, tied about 100 helium balloons to a garden chair and flew over his city in a publicity stunt.

He was the son-in-law of Histiaeus, and inherited the tyranny of Miletus from him.  Background  Map of the ancient Greek western coast of Anatolia. Ionia is in green. Miletus and Naxos are shown. By the time extant history hears of him, Aristagoras is already serving as deputy governor of Miletus, a polis on the western coast of Anatolia around 500 BC. He was the son of Molpagoras, previous tyrant of an independent Miletus, and brother-in-law (and nephewAnepsios, often \\"cousin\\", but in Herodotus, according to Liddell and Scott, \\"nephew.\\") of Histiaeus, whom the Persians had set up as tyrant, but never quite trusted. After general Megabazus presented his complaints about Histiaeus to Darius I of Persia, the latter summoned Histiaeus to his court and detained him at Susa, the main reason being that he wanted a trustworthy advisor. On the recommendation of Histiaeus, the Achaemenids then appointed Aristagoras as the new ruler of Miletus. Aristagoras ruled Miletus while Histiaeus remained in Susa. The assignment was put forward as temporary. Privately, everyone knew that he was being kept under observation away from his troops. Aristagoras was the main orchestrator of the Ionian Revolt on secret instruction by Histiaeus, when the latter learned of Persian plans to interfere directly in Miletus. Aristagoras took advantage of Greek dissatisfaction with Persian rule to incite an alliance of the Greek poleis of Ionia. Soliciting assistance from the states of mainland Greece he failed to obtain the help of a major state, Sparta. He did obtain the half-hearted assistance of Athens. Their attack on the satrapy of Lydia having been defeated, they withdrew, abandoning Aristagoras to his fate. In the last months of the failing revolt, the Persians were reconquering rebel country city by city. Choosing not to remain and make a stand alone, Aristagoras led a colony to Thrace, where he had negotiated a franchise to settle from the Thracians. No sooner did he arrive than he and all his men were massacred in a surprise attack by the Thracians, for reasons unspecified by Herodotus, whether loyal to the Great King, or influenced by the Scythians, who hated the Ionians for their rescue of the Great King, or just because they changed their minds about the number of Hellenes they would allow in their country. The revolt gained momentum briefly but then began to fail again. When all was nearly lost, the Great King allowed Histiaeus to convince him that he could settle the conflict and now should be sent back to Miletus. Aristagoras was gone. According to Herodotus, they never met again. Histiaeus never succeeded in reaching Miletus. Reporting first to Sardis, undoubtedly still recovering from fire, whether with or without the Great King's complicity (Herodotus does not say), he was interrogated concerning his true loyalties. Histiaeus swore complete ignorance of the events of the revolt and unquestionable loyalty to the Persians. He admitted nothing, but the satrap, Artaphernes, was not in the least deceived. He said, \\"I will tell thee how the case stands, Histaeus: this shoe is of thy stitching; Aristagoras has but put it on.\\"Histories, Book VI, Chapter 1. Seeing that the jig was up, Histiaeus escaped that night and took ship at the coast, probably at Ephesus. He had no trouble raising troops and finding ships, but he found that he was not trusted by the revolutionaries. Miletus would not have him back. He became a soldier of fortune in the Aegean until he was hunted down and executed by Artaphernes. The Ionian revolt was finally settled in 494/493 BC. The Persians went on to plot the conquest of Greece under the pretext of a punitive campaign against Athens.  Failure of the Naxos expedition  Ruins of Miletus Certain exiled citizens of Naxos came to Miletus to seek refuge. They asked Aristagoras to supply them with troops, so that they could regain control of their homeland. Aristagoras considered that if he was able to supply troops to the Naxians, then he could become ruler of Naxos. So he agreed to assist the Naxians. He explained that he did not have enough troops of his own, but that Artaphernes, Darius‚Äô brother and the Persian satrap of Lydia, who commanded a large army and navy on the coast of Asia, could help supply troops. The Naxians agreed to Aristagoras seeking Artaphernes' support and supplied him with money. Aristagoras travelled to Sardis and suggested that Artaphernes attack Naxos and restore the exiles. The Persians would then gain control of the island. He explained to Artaphernes that Naxos ‚Äúwas a fine and fertile island, close to the Ionian coast, and rich both in treasures and slaves.‚Äù It was also the gateway to the Cyclades, which the Persians did not yet rule. Aristagoras promised that he would both fund the expedition and give Artaphernes a bonus sum. He also tempted Artaphernes by adding that capturing the island would place other poleis of the Cyclades under his control. They would serve as bases for an invasion of Euboea. After securing the permission of Susa, Artaphernes agreed and promised 200 ships. The following spring, Aristagoras and the Naxian exiles sailed with the fleet. Unfortunately for the success of the invasion, Aristagoras quarrelled with the Persian admiral Megabates. He interfered in the discipline of the latter over the ship captains to save a friend from harsh punishment for an infraction (failure to set a watch on his ship). Aristagoras saved his friend but lost the friendship and loyalty of the Persian admiral, who expected to be in overall command. The schism was irreparable, being the very first incident of the subsequent Ionian revolt. Megabates sabotaged the entire operation by secretly informing the Naxians that they were about to be attacked, taking away the element of surprise. Naxos then had enough time to prepare for a siege. Four months later, the siege still held, the Persians were out of supplies and had only limited funds remaining. The expedition was then considered a failure and the Persians sailed home.  Ionian Revolt  The burning of Sardis, capital of the Asia Minor Satrapy of Lydia, during the Ionian Revolt in 498 BC. Due to his failure to make good on his Naxian promises, Aristagoras‚Äô political position was at risk. He began to plan a revolt with the Milesians and the other Ionians. Meanwhile, Histiaeus, still detained at Susa, had tattooed a message upon the shaved head of a slave. Once his hair had grown back, he sent him to Aristagoras. The message told Aristagoras to revolt. Histiaeus, desperate to resume his authority at Miletus, hoped Darius would send him to deal with a Milesian revolt. Both leaders being of the same mind, Aristagoras conferred with a council of his supporters, who agreed to a rebellion in Miletus in 499 BC. Aristagoras was supported by most of the citizens in council, except the historian Hecataeus.Book V, Chapter 36. The text is one of those telescoping of events that confuse translators and provide fuel for the fires of the critics. Aristagoras calls a consultative meeting (ebouleuonto) with his partisans, or supporters (stasiotai). The very next sentence describes a binding vote to revolt (exepheronto keleuontes apistasthai) and not to adopt the proposals of Hecataeus, a logopoios, not a partisan. A plenipotentiary emissary is sent to seize the fleet and arrest its Persian-employed commanders. As tyrants do not rely on voting to decide policy or send emissaries, the consultative body of partisans cannot be same as the voting body. Apparently after the consultation Aristagoras has given up tyranny and has convened an assembly of the people, which hears proposals and votes on them. Hecataeus voted against the revolt because he believed that the Ionians would be out-matched. Defeat would be inevitable. Once the vote was taken, however, there is no evidence that he recused himself from the revolt. In fact, he had suggestions to make. Once the war began, the Ionians did not allow any fence-sitting among themselves, although they could not stop the larger allies from withdrawing. In general knowledge, warring nations do not allow citizens of any social status to comment from the sidelines without participating in the war effort. As soon as the vote for war was certain, Aristagoras took steps to secure Persian military assets. The Naxos fleet was recovering from its ordeal at Myus. Now in a position of command ‚Äì Herodotus is not specific ‚Äì Aristagoras sent a party under Iatragoras to arrest the admirals still with the fleet, some several men. Ironically, these were mainly Greek. They were later released and sent home. Now that the rebellion was in the open, Aristagoras ‚Äúset himself to damage Darius in every way he could think of.‚Äù The scope of the revolt spread rapidly to all Ionia. Aristagoras foresaw that one city would soon be crushed. He therefore set about to create an alliance of all the Ionian cities, but the members also came from regions beyond Ionia. He made a number of constitutional changes, not all of which are clear. First he relinquished his own tyranny. Approaching the other states, he convinced them to end theirs. Finally he ordered all of the states to create a board of generalsStrategoi, which can only be high-ranking military officers, and not some sort of magistrate as some translators say. As Herodotus does not clarify the duties of a strategos, considering that Aristagoras was interpreted as establishing democracies, most commentators presume that for Herodotus only, a strategos is an archon, or magistrate. The language precludes determining whether single strategoi or many strategoi were being set up in each city. The word \\"command,\\" keleusas, refers to an instruction given by a figure in authority to a subordinate, so to interpret Aristagoras as democratically suggesting each Ionian city vote in its magistrates appears somewhat far-fetched as far as the language is concerned. to report, apparently, to him. When his government was in place he sailed to Lacedaemon and other states of Greece in search of allies. There has been some question as to the exact meaning of Herodotus' governmental terms, and as to the form of government of the Ionian alliance. The most fundamental question is where Aristagoras got his authority over the Ionians in the first place. They were all under the satrapy of Lydia, not under Miletus. The satrap was Persian. The tyrant of Miletus was appointed by the satrap, but he also appointed all the other tyrants. For reasons not specified in Herodotus, Miletus had the upper hand.There are some credible theories. The use of koinon, Latin res publica, to refer to the Ionians under Aristagoras suggests that the former Ionian League, also termed a koinon, had been restored again with Aristagoras as chief officer:. In a second theory, pointing out that Histiaeus was arrested by the Chians as a Persian agent, and asserting \\"Histiaeus at Susa was not a pampered political prisoner,\\" Georges attributes the influence of Miletus to Darius himself, in support of Histiaeus: . One can only assume a leadership role of some kind of Aristagoras over the other tyrants, whether personal or according to some unspecified convention. In order to gain the participation of the people in the revolt, we are told, Aristagoras \\"let go\\" the tyranny and established isonomia, which the translators translate variously with imprecise terms, such as \\"equality of government.\\" According to Liddell and Scott, a standard dictionary of ancient Greek, Thucydides uses it to mean the \\"equality of rights\\" in a democracy. Apparently Aristagoras established democracy, but then he went on to \\"put a stop to tyranny\\" in all the other Ionian cities, and moreover to insist that they select boards of generals reporting to him, which are not democratic powers. No voting is mentioned. Apparently a new sovereign state had been formed with Aristagoras as its chief. He had not stepped down, but up. The state had the power to levy taxes and troops. Aristagoras was commander of the joint armed forces. Miletus was to be the new capital. In fact the new sovereign Ionia issued its own coinage between 499 and its destruction by the Persians in 494.  Spartan refusal to provide assistance  Ruins of Sparta Aristagoras appealed to the Spartan king, Cleomenes I, to help them throw off the Persian yoke. He praised the quality of the Spartan warriors, and argued that a pre-emptive invasion of Persia would be easy. To illustrate his view, he had brought along a \\"bronze tablet on which a map of all the earth was engraved, and all the sea, and all the rivers.\\"Book V, Chapter 49. No more information is given about the map, but the circumstantial evidence suggests it was most likely the world map of Hecataeus of Miletus, an important player in Milesian political life of the times. Aristagoras claimed that the Persians would be easy to defeat, as they fought in ‚Äútrousers and turbans,‚Äù clearly not a sign of good warriors. He also tempted him with Persian riches. Cleomenes asked Aristagoras to wait two days for an answer. When they next met, Cleomenes asked how long it would take to reach Susa, and upon learning that it was a three months‚Äô journey, he firmly refused Spartan assistance as his troops would be gone for too long. At the time, Sparta was concerned over possible attacks from the Argives. The Greek historian Herodotus claimed that Aristagoras attempted to change Cleomenes‚Äô mind with bribes, until the king's young daughter Gorgo warned that Aristagoras would corrupt him. Aristagoras left without the requested assistance.  Defeat of the Athenians  Aristagoras next went to Athens, where he made a convincing speech, promising ‚Äúeverything that came into his head, until at last he succeeded.‚Äù Won over, the Athenians agreed to send ships to Ionia and Aristagoras went before them. The Athenians subsequently arrived in Miletus with twenty triremes and five others that belonged to the Eretrians. Herodotus described the arrival of these ships as the beginning of troubles between Greeks and barbarians. Once all his allies had arrived, Aristagoras put his brother Charopinus and another Milesian, Hermophantus, in charge of the expedition, and the whole contingent set out for the provincial capital, Sardis, while Aristagoras remained to govern at Miletus. Ruins of Ephesus The acropolis at Sardis, now forested and eroded, with a few pinnacles of ruins. The first leg of the journey was to proceed along the coast to Ephesus. Using it as base, they went overland to Sardis, on which they descended by surprise. The satrap Artaphernes and his forces retreated to the acropolis immediately. A fire, started by accident in the town, accidentally burned down the temple of the Lydian goddess Cybebe (Cybele). Attributing the fire to Ionian maliciousness, the Persians later used it as an excuse for burning Greek temples. The fire forced the defenders of the acropolis to abandon it in favor of the marketplace. Its defence coincided fortuitously with the arrival of Persian reinforcements. Interpreting the tumult as a counter-attack, The Ionians retreated to Tmolus, a nearby elevation, from which they escaped by night. The reinforcements followed the Ionians, caught up with them near Ephesus and soundly defeated them.The scenario is partly covered in Histories, Book V, Chapters 102-103, with additional details to be found in The Persians had obtained Lydia, including all the Greek cities, by defeating the last Anatolian-speaking kingdom of the same name. They made such a show of mercy as to win the hearts and minds of the Anatolians, as well as of some of the Greeks. In that sense, the \\"Ionian Revolt\\" was de facto an Anatolian civil war. A call for assistance went rapidly around the satrapy. Joint Persian- Anatolian forces hastened overnight to the assistance of the satrap. They arrived with such short notice and major fanfare as to frighten away the Ionian-Athenian forces. The Cambridge Ancient History article attributes this swift arrival to the Persian cavalry, which also had no trouble tracking and catching the Ionians before the gates of Ephesus. The losses of the East Greeks were so great that they slunk away, so to speak, leaving Aristagoras and the rebels to fend for themselves. An air of doom pervaded the revolt, but they fought with such spirit that the rebellion spilled over into the islands After this battle, the Athenians refused to continue to fight in the Ionian Revolt and returned to Athens. Because of their participation in this battle, however, the Persian king, Darius, swore vengeance on Athens and commanded a servant to repeat to him three times every day at dinner, ‚ÄúMaster, remember the Athenians.‚Äù The story is somewhat and probably hypocritically naive (but not necessarily on that account false), as the Persians intended expansion into the Balkans all along. They still held parts of Thrace from their previous abortive expedition into Scythia, only stopped when they learned the true size of the country (most of Russia) and the danger of their position in it. The Ionians fought on, gaining control of Byzantium and the surrounding towns as well as the greater part of Caria and Caunus. They were not, however, alone. In this last phase of the conflict, almost all of Cyprus also rebelled against the Persians. Onesilus, the younger brother of Gorgus, the ruler of Salamis, tried to convince his brother to rebel against Persia and join in the Ionian Revolt. When his brother refused to support the revolt, Onesilus waited until he left Salamis and then shut the city gates on him. Gorgus fled to the Persians while Onesilus took over and convinced the Cyprians to revolt. They then proceeded to lay siege to the city of Amathus. Manville's theory of a power struggle between Aristagoras and Histiaeus Herodotus‚Äô account is the best source we have on the events that amounted to a collision between Persia, which was expanding westward, and classical Greece at its peak. Nevertheless, its depictions are often scanty and uncertain, or incomplete. One of the major uncertainties of the Ionian revolt in Herodotus is why it occurred in the first place. In retrospect the case seems obvious: Persia disputed the Hellenes for control of cities and territories. The Hellenes had either to fight for their freedom or submit. The desirability of these material objects was certainly economic, although considerations of defence and ideology may well have played a part. These are the motives generally accepted today, after long retrospect. Herodotus apparently knew of no such motives, or if he did, he did not care to analyse history at that level. J D Manville characterizes his approach as the attribution of ‚Äúpersonal motivation‚Äù to players such as Aristagoras and Histiaeus. In his view, Herodotus ‚Äúmay seem to overemphasize personal motivation as a cause,‚Äù but he really does not. We have either to fault Herodotus for his lack of analytical perspicacity or try to find credible reasons in the historical context for actions to which Herodotus gives incomplete explanations. Manville suggests that the unexplained places mark events in a secret scenario about which Herodotus could not have known, but he records what he does know faithfully. It is up to the historian to reconstruct the secret history by re-interpretation and speculation, a technique often used by historical novelists. Manville puts it forward as history. The main players are portrayed by Herodotus as naturally hypocritical. They always have an ulterior motive which they go to great lengths to conceal behind persuasive lies. Thus neither Aristagoras nor Histiaeus are fighting for freedom, nor do they cooperate or collaborate. Each has a personal motive related to greed, ambition, or fear. Manville fills in the uncertainties with hypothetical motives. Thus he arrives, perhaps less credibly for his invention, at a behind-the-scenes struggle for dominance between Aristagoras and Histiaeus. They can best be described as rivals or even enemies. Some of the high points of the argument are as follows. While Histiaeus was away serving Darius, Aristagoras acted in his stead as deputy of Miletus where, it is argued, he worked on securing his own power. The word for deputy is epitropos, which he was when the Naxian deputation arrived. By the time the fleet departs for Naxos, Aristagoras has promoted himself to ‚Äútyrant of Miletus.‚Äù There is no explicit statement that he asked Histiaeus‚Äô permission or was promoted by Histaeus. Instead, Aristagoras turned to Artaphernes, who was said to be jealous of Histiaeus. It is true that Artaphernes would not move without consulting the Great King, and that the latter's advisor on Greek affairs was Histiaeus. However, Manville sees a coup by Aristagoras, presuming not only that the Great King's advisor did not advise, but was kept in the dark about his own supersession. When the expedition failed, Histiaeus sent his tattooed slave to Aristagoras, not as encouragement to revolt, but as an ultimatum. Manville provides an underlying value system to fill in the gap left by Herodotus: revolt was so unthinkable that Histiaeus could bring the fantasies of his opponent back to reality by suggesting that he do it, a sort of ‚Äúgo ahead, commit suicide.‚Äù Histiaeus was, in Manville's speculation, ordering Aristagoras to give up his rule or suffer the consequences. Apparently, he was not being kept in the dark by the king after all. Manville leaves us to guess why the king did not just crush the revolt by returning the supposedly loyal Histiaeus to power. However, at this time Histiaeus was still required to remain in Susa and, despite his threat, he was unable to do anything if Aristagoras did revolt. Realizing that this would be his last chance to gain power Aristagoras started the revolt despite Histiaeus‚Äô threat. This is a surprise to Manville's readers, as we thought he already had power via a coup. Manville does note the contradiction mentioned above, that Aristagoras gave up tyranny, yet was able to force democracy on the other cities and command their obedience to him. We are to see in this paradox a strategy to depose Histiaeus, whom we thought was already deposed. The tale goes on to an attempt by Histiaeus to form an alliance with Artaphernes to depose the usurper and regain his power at Miletus. Artaphernes, though he was involved in open war with Aristagoras, refuses. The tale told by Manville thus contains events related by Herodotus supplemented by non-events coming from Manville's imagination.  Myres‚Äô Theory of a balance of power between thalassocracies  John Myres, classical archaeologist and scholar, whose career began in the reign of Queen Victoria and did not end until 1954, close friend and companion of Arthur Evans, and intelligence officer par excellence of the British Empire, developed a theory of the Ionian Revolt that explains it in terms of the stock political views of the empire, balance of power and power vacuum. Those views, still generally familiar, assert that peace is to be found in a region controlled by competing geopolitical powers, none of which are strong enough to defeat the others. If a power drops from the roster for any reason, a ‚Äúvacuum‚Äù then exists, which causes violent competition until the balance is readjusted. In a key article of 1906, while Evans was excavating Knossos, the Ottoman Empire had lost Crete due to British intervention, and questions of the ‚Äúsick man of Europe‚Äù were being considered by all the powers. Referring to the failing Ottoman Empire and the power vacuum that would be left when it fell, the young Myres published an article studying the balance of what he termed ‚Äúsea-power‚Äù in the eastern Mediterranean in classical times. The word \\"sea-power\\" was intended to define his ‚Äúthalassocracy.‚Äù Myres was using sea-power in a specifically British sense for the times. The Americans had their own idea of sea power, expressed in Alfred Thayer Mahan‚Äôs great strategic work, ‚Äò‚ÄôThe Influence of Sea Power upon History‚Äô‚Äô. which advocated maintaining a powerful navy and using it for strategic purposes, such as ‚Äúcommand of the sea,‚Äù a kind of domination. The United States Naval Academy used this meaning for its motto, ‚Äò‚Äôex scientia tridens‚Äô‚Äô, ‚Äúsea-power through knowledge.‚Äù It named one of its buildings, Mahan Hall. Far different is Myres‚Äô ‚Äúsea-power‚Äù and the meaning of thalassocracy, which means ‚Äúrule of the seas.‚Äú In contrast to ‚Äútridens,‚Äù rule of the seas is not a paternalistic but democratic arrangement. Where there are rulers, there are the ruled. A kind of exclusivity is meant, such as in Rule, Britannia!. Specifically, in a thalassocracy, the fleets of the ruler may go where they will and do as they please, but the ruled may go nowhere and engage in no operation without express permission of the ruler. You need a license, so to speak, to be on ruled waters, and if you do not have it, your ships are attacked and destroyed. ‚ÄúShoot on sight‚Äù is the policy. And so Carthaginian ships sank any ships in their waters, etc. = The list of thalassocracies = Thalassocracy was a new word in the theories of the late 19th century, from which some conclude it was a scholarly innovation of the times. It was rather a resurrection of a word known from a very specific classical document, which Myres calls ‚Äúthe List of Thalassocracies.‚Äù It occurs in the Chronicon of Eusebius, the early 4th century Bishop of Caesarea Maritima, the ruins now in Israel.A translation can be found in In Eusebius, the list is a separate chronology. Jerome, 4th-century theologian and historian, creator of the Vulgate, interspersed the same items, translated into Latin, in his Chronicon of world events.The relevant section of the Chronicon in Latin may be found at . The items contain the words ‚Äúobtinuerunt mare,‚Äù strictly speaking, ‚Äúobtained the sea,‚Äù and not ‚Äúhold sea power,‚Äù although the latter meaning may be implied as a result. Just as Jerome utilized the chronology of Eusebius, so Eusebius utilized the chronology of Castor of Rhodes, a 1st-century BC historian. His work has been entirely lost except for fragments, including his list of thalassocracies. A thousand years later, the Byzantine monk, George Syncellus, also used items from the list in his massive Extract of Chronography. Over the centuries the realization grew that all these references to sea-power in the Aegean came from a single document, a resource now reflected in the fragments of those who relied on it. C Bunsen, whose translator was one of the first to use thalassocracy, attributed its discovery to the German scholar, Christian Gottlob Heyne In a short work composed in 1769, published in 1771, Eusebius‚Äô Chronicon being known at that time only through fragments in the two authors mentioned, Heyne reconstructed the list in their Greek and Latin (with uncanny accuracy), the whole title of the article being Super Castoris epochis populorum thalattokratesanton H.E. (hoc est) qui imperium maris tenuisse dicuntur, ‚ÄúAbout Castor's epochs of thalattocratizing peoples; that is, those who are said to have held the imperium over the sea.‚Äù To thalattokratize is ‚Äúto rule the sea,‚Äù not just to hold sea power like any other good fellow with a strong navy. The thalattokratizer holds the imperium over the watery domain just as if it were a country, which explains how such a people can ‚Äúobtain‚Äù and ‚Äúhave‚Äù the sea. The list presented therefore is one of successive exclusive domains. No two peoples can hold the same domain or share rule over it, although they can operate under the authority of the thalassocrat, a privilege reserved for paying allies. According to Bunsen, the discovery and translation of the Armenian version of Eusebius‚Äô Chronicon changed the nature of the search for thalassocracy. It provided the original document, but there was a disclaimer attached, that it was in fact ‚Äúan extract from the epitome of Diodorus,‚Äù meaning Diodorus Siculus, a 1st-century BC historian. The disclaimer cannot be verified, as that part of Diodorus‚Äô work is missing, which, however, opens the argument to another question: if Eusebius could copy a standard source from Diodorus, why cannot Diodorus have copied it from someone else? It is at this point that Myres picks up the argument. Noting that thalassokratesai, ‚Äúbe a thalassocrat,‚Äù meaning ‚Äúrule the waves,‚Äù was used in a number of authors: elsewhere by Diodorus, by Polybius, 2nd century BC historian, of Carthage, of Chios by Strabo, 1st century BC geographer and some others, he supposes that the source document might have been available to them all (but not necessarily, the cautious Myres points out). The document can be dated by its content: a list of 17 thalassocracies extending from the Lydian after the fall of Troy to the Aeginetan, which ended with the cession of power to Athens in 480 BC. The Battle of Salamis included 200 new Athenian triremes plus all the ships of its new ally, Aegina. Despite various revolts Aegina went on to become part of the Delian League, an imperial treaty of the new Athenian thalassocracy. Thucydides writes of it after 432 BC, but Herodotus, who visited Athens ‚Äúas late as 444 B.C.‚Äù does not know a thing about it. This tentative date for the Eusebian list does not exclude the possibility of an earlier similar document used by Herodotus. = Myres‚Äô historical reconstruction of the list = The order of thalassocracies in the various versions of the list is nearly fixed, but the dates need considerable adjustment, which Myres sets about to reconcile through all historical sources available to him. He discovers some gaps. The solidest part of the list brackets the Ionian Revolt. The Milesian thalassocracy is dated 604-585 BC. It was ended by Alyattes of Lydia, founder of the Lydian Empire, who also fought against the Medes. The latter struggle was ended by the Eclipse of Thales at the Battle of the Halys River in 585 BC, when the combatants, interpreting the phenomenon as a sign, made peace. The Lydians were now free to turn on Miletus, which they did for the next 11 years, reducing it. When the Persians conquered Lydia in 547/546 they acquired the Ionian cities. After 585 BC there is a gap in the list. Lesbos and one or more unknown thalassocrats held the sea in unknown order. In 577 BC began the thalassocracy of Phocaea. Breaking out of its Anatolian cage, it founded Marseilles and cities in Spain and Italy, wresting a domain away from Carthage and all other opponents. Their thalassocracy ended when, in the revolt of the Lydian Pactyas, who had been instructed to collect taxes by the Persians, but used them to raise an army of revolt, the Ionian cities were attacked by the Persians. The Phocaeans abandoned Phocaea about 534 BC and after much adventuring settled in the west. The thalassocracy of Samos spans the career of the tyrant, Polycrates, there. The dates of the tyrant are somewhat uncertain and variable, but at some time prior to 534 BC, he and his brothers staged a coup during a festival at Samos. Samos happened to have a large navy of pentekonters. Becoming a ship collector, he attacked and subdued all the neighbouring islands, adding their ships to his fleet. Finally he added a new model, the trireme. His reign came to an end about 517 BC when, taking up the Great King's invitation to a friendly banquet for a discussion of prospects, he was suddenly assassinated. There were no prospects. However, if he had chosen not to attend, he was doomed anyway. Some of his trireme captains, learning of a devious plot by him to have them assassinated by Egyptian dignitaries while on official business, sailed to Sparta to beg help, which they received. The adventurous young king, Cleomenes I, was spared the trouble of killing Polycrates, but led an expedition to Samos anyway, taking the thalassocracy for two years, 517-515. Adventure and piracy not being activities approved by the Spartan people, they tagged him as insane and insisted he come home. The sea was now available to Naxos, 515-505.  Aftermath  The Hellenes had obtained a foothold on the coast of Anatolia by siding with rebel coastal Anatolian states against the Hittite Empire.Questions of settlement of the coast of Anatolia by Hellenes is a major topic of Bronze Age studies. A summary can be found in . Miletus began its career in history as the city of Millawanda in the Anatolian-speaking state of Mira in the rebel district of Arzawa, which received assistance from Ahhiyawa or Achaea, which was Greece (pp 407-408). By 1264 BC Millawanda was a protectorate of Ahhiyawa, by which time Greek immigration had begun. By the late 8th century BC Assyrian texts were calling the region Yaw(a)naya, or Ionia. Presumably it had become Miletus, from Milawata, and was Hellenic. Their position was made more solid by the fall of Troy against a coalition of mainland Greek kings. The coastal cities managed to retain their positions against the subsequent Phrygian invasion of Anatolia by joining with the rump Anatolian states, while the Hittites withdrew into neo-Hittite states in Syria. The coastal cities, now entirely Hellenic, continued to receive immigrants from mainland Greece. The massive transfer of Persian-speaking population from the steppes of Central Asia to the range they now occupy presented the Anatolian Hellenes with an impossible strategic problem. They could not hope to oppose their small armies against the resources of the vast Persian empire unless they could once again receive major support from the mainland Greek states, especially the maritime power of Athens. Those states, however, were reluctant to take on the might of ancient Persia. Consequently, the Hellenic states in Anatolia submitted reluctantly to Persian rule, and were placed in the new satrapy of Lydia, with capital at Sardis. The satrap of Lydia allowed self-rule as long as taxes were paid and the supremacy of ancient Persia was granted. Many of the Anatolian cities proved loyal subjects. However, underlying resentment against Persian rule was universal. Persia was not interested in the status quo. Their desire to expand to the west brought them into conflict with Ionia over the question of self-rule, one of the principles of the agreement of the city-states to submit. Their interference in Miletus was the spark that set off the Ionian revolt. Aristagoras, the first rebel ruler, appeared then as the champion of Greek freedom. The Ionians had high hopes of independence. Due to the disparity in resources and the reluctance of the mainland states to involve themselves, the tide soon turned in favour of the Persians. After only one year, the Cyprians were once again forced into submission by Persia. The cities around the Hellespont fell one after another to Daurises, the son-in-law of king Darius. The Carians fought the Persians at the Maeander River and were defeated with severe casualties. Aristagoras, seeing the rebellion falling to pieces around him, and little help forthcoming from the Greeks, began looking for a shelter to which he could execute a strategic retreat. He and his men resolved on Myrcinus in Thrace, which had been an Ionian stronghold in the abortive Persian invasion of Scythia. He put Pythagoras, ‚Äúa man of distinction,‚Äù in charge of Miletus and set sail for Thrace, where he attempted to establish a colony on the Strymon river, at the same site as the later Athenian colony of Amphipolis. The Thracians, not now disposed to tolerate any further presence of Greeks in their country, opposed this incursion. He gained control of the territory but later, while besieging a neighbouring town, Aristagoras was killed in battle. Expecting a swift Persian victory, Aristagoras had hoped to establish a redoubt of Ionians, who would come to the assistance of Miletus at a later time.The unobectivity of Herodotus' emotional reaction to Aristagoras' departure from Miletus is pointed out in By an accidental sequence of historical events his reputation drew the ire of his main historian, Herodotus of Halicarnassus, an Ionian partisan, to such a degree that it suffers yet. Although a champion of freedom, Aristagoras is the only man in all his histories that Herodotus openly calls a coward, blaming his supposed flight for the defeat of the revolt. The revolt apparently intensified and spread into the islands. Aristagoras had no way of knowing that he would have been in the van of it, or that the Thracians would not allow a redoubt. The revolt was over by 494/493 BC. Going directly for Miletus in 494, the Persians defeated the Ionians with their own weapon, the ship, in the Battle of Lade, an island off Miletus. The city was then subject to a siege and the war lost at its fall. Although there was some mild devastation of rebel cities (except for Miletus, which was razed and the population decimated and transported), the Persians were interested in ruling rather than revenge. They began to plan forthwith for the largest invasion of Greece yet undertaken, executed starting 490 BC in a series of conflicts called the Greco-Persian Wars, which are yet famous. Unfortunately for the Persians, they were forced to adopt contingents of Ionian Greeks into their armies and navies.  Herodotus as a source  Most of the information on Aristagoras and his actions comes from the writings of the ancient Greek historian Herodotus. On the one hand he is virtually the only literary source for the events he presents as history. While in many ways he reflects some of the best of ancient historiography, on the other hand, his work is sprinkled with motivational and logical lacunae, creating textual paradoxes everywhere, causing some scholars to be critical of his value as a historical source, especially regarding the Ionian Revolt. For purposes of this presentation, textual criticism may be polarized into two camps: the cynical, discrediting Herodotus as an unreliable source, and the affirmative, which credits him with being reliable as far as he goes. = The cynical view= Manville's cynical view concerning an imaginary power struggle between Aristagoras and Histiaeus isolated from the usual contexts of war and society has already been mentioned above. Manville has no confidence in Herodotus' ability to relate connected history and therefore supplies connections for him out of his own speculations. He was preceded in this method by the earlier work of Mabel Lang. A 1968 article by Lang focuses on the paradoxes of the Ionian revolt. For example, Histiaeus originally won the Great King's favor by protecting his escape from Scythia over a key bridge of the Danube.Book IV, Chapters 140-141. The bridge had been partly broken down. Arriving at the bank, the king had a caller call for Histiaeus, who arrived in a fleet of boats to ferry him across and rebuild the bridge. Despite this vital rescue to save the king and all his forces, he shortly after plots a rebellion! Lang suggests that one might conclude to an ulterior motive at the bridge, \\"to ingratiate himself with Darius so that he could be on the inside of the king's policy.\\" Apparently, to be on the inside of his policy he has to save his life and the lives of all his army by letting him escape from the large Scythian army not far behind. He prefers to keep him alive for nothing more serious than keeping an eye on him. Nonchalantly Lang writes: \\"Presumably revolt was already in the air,....\\" It could not have been far in the air if Histiaeus passed up a chance for total victory at the outset, a prized goal of many a lightning campaign in world history afterwards. The basic problem is Lang's cynicism: \\"we should not hope to discover the truth about the result merely by accepting the narrative ....\\" Accordingly, she rehearses a catalogue of paradoxes similar to Manville's weaving her own fantasy of unattested events to contain it. Her explanation of why such a tale is necessary is similarly speculative: \\"the failure of the revolt not only gave prominence to every aspect and event which would explain, justify or anticipate the disastrous results but also cast into the shade any intentions which deserved a better fate and any temporary successes during the course of the war.\\" Not having any other account with which to compare these events, she cannot possibly know that. = The affirmative view = The cynical view described above reflects a difference in expectation between Herodotus and his target audiences, which by the accidents of time are multiple and various. He did not write for us moderns. Reading that he was the first historian whose work survived in anything more than scattered fragments, we expect him to have the proper concern of modern historians for continuity and causality, which other ancient historians, such as Thucydides, have. Herodotus is not one of those. With regard to causation, the Cambridge Ancient History article asserts: ‚Äú...Herodotus does not seem to have innovated: he merely accepted the causation appropriate to his subject and period.‚Äù It would be convenient to attribute this unconcern to a sort of intermediate phase between mythology and history, as many do. Such a view is neglectful of the ravages of time. Herodotus was not the first historian in any way, only the first whose work survived. He wrote of the Ionian Revolt a full generation after it happened; moreover, he was not a participant. He relied on the work of several previous historians at Miletus, of which fragments and mention have survived, chief of which was Hecataeus of Miletus.The CAH article summarizes several historians whose fragments are similar to passages in Herodotus, to be found at Herodotus apparently designed his work according to a specific plan and style. Whether the previous historians used it is not known, due to the paucity of evidence, but it seems unlikely. He appears to use Hecataeus as a framework for his historical events. The fragments of Hecataeus suggest that he wrote only an annal-like sequence long on names and events but short on connecting narrative. To this framework Herodotus adds the logoi, or independent anecdotes of persons and events derived from independent oral traditions, which Herodotus obtained by interview with record-keepers and state historians. The disconnectedness comes from their being independent. It is pointless, therefore, to try to invent connections. The ancient historians have therefore invented a special category for Herodotus, that he was a logographer, or teller of logoi, based on his own characterization of his sources as logopoioi, ‚Äústory makers.‚Äù Usually the logographers include Hecataeus and the other historians of his generation, who lived through the revolt. There is little evidence of their logography. Whether Herodotus stands alone or is part of a Milesian tradition is a matter of speculation. Validation of Herodotus therefore rests on validation of his logoi. There is no general validation, but the much-desired archaeological and inscriptional evidence appears to validate a few events as far as they go: some names, circumstances of war, and similar peripheral facts. He cannot be validated as a modern historian, but he does have an overall design, which is ‚ÄúBiblical‚Äù or ‚ÄúBible-like‚Äù in scope. He is trying to do an epic in prose similar to the Homerica in verse. His topic is not the Trojan War, but the Graeco-Persian Wars. (The Homerica have been called the pagan Greek ‚ÄúBible.\\") Says Oswyn Murray in the Cambridge Ancient History, > It is certainly hard to find fault with his general view that the only > adequate explanation for the Persian Wars must be a complete account of > relations between the two peoples since the conquest of the Ionian cities in > 545 B.C. In short, Herodotus is personal because the Homerica are personal. Both genres intend to portray the illustrious or non-illustrious deeds and doings of persons in the contexts of mighty wars. Thus Aristagoras personally can be called a ‚Äúcoward.‚Äù The lying that they do is metis, ‚Äúcunning,‚Äù an admired Greek virtue practised by the greatest hero of them all, the crafty Odysseus. The literary tradition of it went on. Virgil could include the half-line Timeo Graecos dona ferentes, ‚ÄúI fear Greeks bearing Gifts,‚Äù in the Aeneid. The expectation of modernity in Herodotus is misplaced. Validation must be sought for individual logoi. The whole work or any part of it cannot logically be condemned on the basis of one or a group of paradoxes. All scepticism must have a reason for doubting. The inconsistencies of Herodotus are not a valid reason, which is generally true. But few stories are ever free of inconsistency, and if they are, they are suspect on that account (‚Äútoo good to be true‚Äù). Denials of Herodotus' validity, from mild to severe, although widespread, were never universal. As an example of ancient information generally agreed to be invalid, many works attributed to various authors have been placed in the \\"pseudo-\\" category after as much as centuries of review. There was never any such universal and long-standing denial of Herodotus. On the contrary, the main events, such as the Battles of Marathon and Thermopylae, have been accepted as basically credible by many scholars of many ages. It is therefore misplaced to speak of the \\"rehabilitation\\" of Herodotus in medical or neo-ideologic terms. Accordingly, the most sanguine view treats his work as though no problems exist regarding it. Referring to the Cambridge Ancient History article on the Ionian Revolt by Murray, Georges addresses \\"the question of Herodotus' veracity and reliability.\\" Repeating Murray's criticism that \\"the traditions concerning the revolt itself are ... fragmented into individual episodes of folly, treachery, or heroism\\" and therefore are not \\"trustworthy materials for the history of the revolt,\\" he asserts to the contrary that \\"Herodotus' account furnishes the material for a coherent and credible account of the actions and events it presents ....\\" Having said this, Georges must now show that, rather than being paradoxical, Herodotus is coherent and credible. Like Lang, having no other account to offer, he must make his demonstrations from the text of Herodotus, which he spends the rest of the article doing, disputing most of Murray's interpretations. The contradictions are not to be viewed as contradictions. He does not address the question of why, if they are not so, it is necessary to spend an article in disputation over them. The result is a new set of speculations fully as imaginary as Murray's, not being based on any alternative texts. There is hope, however, as fragments of Greek texts and inscriptions continue to be discovered. Meanwhile, it seems common knowledge that the public of any age is not going to relinquish credibility in Herodotus' great depiction of the Persian Wars.

Its common name is derived from Moreton Bay in Queensland, Australia. It is best known for its imposing buttress roots. As Ficus macrophylla is a strangler fig, seed germination usually takes place in the canopy of a host tree and the seedling lives as an epiphyte until its roots establish contact with the ground. It then enlarges and strangles its host, eventually becoming a freestanding tree by itself. Individuals may reach in height. The large leathery, dark green leaves are long. The fruit is small, round and greenish, ripening and turning purple at any time of year; it is known as a syconium, an inverted inflorescence with the flowers lining an internal cavity. Like all figs, it has an obligate mutualism with fig wasps; figs are pollinated only by fig wasps, and fig wasps can reproduce only in fig flowers. Many species of bird, including pigeons, parrots and various passerines, eat the fruit. Ficus macrophylla is widely used as a feature tree in public parks and gardens in warmer climates such as California, Portugal, Italy, Spain, Malta, northern New Zealand (Auckland), and Australia. Old specimens can reach tremendous size. Its aggressive root system renders it unsuitable for all but the largest private gardens. Taxonomy South African botanist Christiaan Hendrik Persoon published a formal description of the Moreton Bay fig in his 1807 work Synopsis Plantarum, the material having been reported by French botanist Ren√© Louiche Desfontaines in 1804. The type specimen has been lost, but was possibly located in Florence. The specific epithet macrophylla is derived from the Ancient Greek makros \\"large\\" and phyllon \\"leaf\\", and refers to the size of the leaves. In the early 19th century, Italian botanist Vincenzo Tineo of the Orto botanico di Palermo in Sicily obtained a plant from a French nursery that grew to a prodigious size with a banyan habit. This form was propagated and grown in gardens around Sicily. A later director of the gardens, Antonino Borz√¨, described it as Ficus magnolioides in 1897, distinguishing it from F. macrophylla on account of its larger leaves with greener undersides. This name was widely used in Europe. Australian botanist Charles Moore described Ficus columnaris in 1870 from material collected from Lord Howe Island, choosing the species name from the Latin columnaris for the column-like roots. English botanist E. J. H. Corner reduced this to synonymy with F. macrophylla in 1965, before P. S. Green noted it was distinct enough for subspecies status in 1986. Australian botanist Dale J. Dixon reviewed material and felt the differences too minor to warrant subspecific status, and recognised two forms: Ficus macrophylla f. macrophylla, a free-standing tree endemic to mainland Australia; and Ficus macrophylla f. columnaris, a hemiepiphyte lacking a distinct main trunk and endemic to Lord Howe Island. Review of F. magnolioides by Silvio Fici and Francesco Maria Raimondo found that it was F. macrophylla f. columnaris. The species is generally commonly known as the Moreton Bay fig, after Moreton Bay in southern Queensland, although it is found elsewhere. An alternate name‚Äîblack fig‚Äîis derived from the dark colour of the ageing bark. With over 750 species, Ficus is one of the largest angiosperm genera. Based on morphology, Corner divided the genus into four subgenera; later expanded to six. In this classification, the Moreton Bay fig was placed in subseries Malvanthereae, series Malvanthereae, section Malvanthera of the subgenus Urostigma. In his reclassification of the Australian Malvanthera, Dixon altered the delimitations of the series within the section, but left this species in series Malvanthereae. In 2005, Dutch botanist Cornelis Berg completed Corner's treatment of the Moraceae for the Flora Malesiana; the completion of that work had been delayed since 1972 as a result of disagreements between Corner and C. J. J. G. van Steenis, editor of the Flora Malesiana. Berg combined sections Stilpnophyllum and Malvanthera into an expanded section Stilpnophyllum. This left the Moreton Bay fig in subsection Malvanthera, section Stilpnophyllum. In a 2008 study on DNA sequences from the nuclear ribosomal internal and external transcribed spacers, Danish botanist Nina R√∏nsted and colleagues rejected previous subdivisions of the Malvanthera. Instead, they divided section Malvanthera into three subsections‚ÄîMalvantherae, Platypodeae and Hesperidiiformes. In this system, the Moreton Bay fig is in the subsection Malvantherae, along with F. pleurocarpa. The Malvantherae appear to be basal (an early offshoot) to the group. F. macrophylla form macrophylla is native to mainland Australia, while form columnaris of macrophylla colonised Lord Howe Island. The section Malvanthera itself is thought to have evolved 41 million years ago and radiated around 35 million years ago. Description A Moreton Bay fig in Piazza Marina (Palermo), the biggest of Europe. The aerial roots thicken into columns after reaching the ground. The Moreton Bay fig is an evergreen tree that can reach heights of . The trunk can be massive, with thick, prominent buttressing, and reach a diameter of . The rough bark is grey-brown, and marked with various blemishes. The Lord Howe form of Moreton Bay fig has a habit of dropping aerial roots from its branches, which upon reaching the ground, thicken into supplementary trunks which help to support the weight of its crown. It is a rainforest plant and in this environment more often grows in the form of an epiphytic strangler vine than that of a tree. When its seeds land in the branch of a host tree it sends aerial, \\"strangler\\" roots down the host trunk, eventually killing the host and standing alone. It is monoecious: each tree bears functional male and female flowers. As indicated by its specific epithet, it has large, elliptic, leathery, dark green leaves, long, and they are arranged alternately on the stems. The leaves and branches bleed a milky sap if cut or broken. The figs are in diameter, turning from green to purple with lighter spots as they ripen; ripe fruit may be found year-round, although they are more abundant from February to May. Distribution and habitat Emergent Moreton Bay fig in situ, estimated 50 metres tall, Davis Scrub Nature Reserve, Australia The Moreton Bay fig is a native of eastern coastal Australia, from the Wide Bay‚ÄìBurnett region in central Queensland, to the Shoalhaven River on the New South Wales south coast. It is found in subtropical, warm temperate and dry rainforest, where, as an emergent tree, its crown may tower above the canopy, particularly along watercourses on alluvial soils. In the Sydney region, F. macrophylla grows from sea level to 300 m (1000 ft) altitude, in areas with an average yearly rainfall of . It often grows with trees such as white booyong (Argyrodendron trifoliolatum), Flindersia species, giant stinging tree (Dendrocnide excelsa), lacebark (Brachychiton discolor), red cedar (Toona ciliata), hoop pine (Araucaria cunninghamii), green-leaved fig (Ficus watkinsiana) and Cryptocarya obovata. The soils it grows on are high in nutrients, and include Bumbo Latite and Budgong Sandstone. As rainforests were cleared, isolated specimens were left standing in fields as remnant trees, valued for their shade and shelter for livestock. One such tree was a landmark for and gave its name to the Wollongong suburb of Figtree in New South Wales. Ecology Moreton Bay fig tree in Balboa Park, San Diego The huge numbers of fruit produced by the Moreton Bay fig make it a key source of food in the rainforest. It is an important food to the green catbird (Ailuroedus crassirostris), as well as fruit-eating pigeons such as the wompoo fruit-dove (Ptilinopus magnificus), and topknot pigeon (Lopholaimus antarcticus), and a sometime food of the rose-crowned fruit-dove (Ptilinopus regina). Other bird species that eat the fruit include the yellow-eyed cuckoo-shrike (Coracina lineata), pied currawong (Strepera graculina), Australasian figbird (Sphecotheres vieilloti), Regent bowerbird (Sericulus chrysocephalus), satin bowerbird (Ptilonorhynchus violaceus), and Lewin's honeyeater (Meliphaga lewinii). Fruit bats such as the grey-headed flying-fox (Pteropus poliocephalus) also feed on the fruit. As well as the pollinating fig wasp, Pleistodontes froggatti, syconia of the Moreton Bay fig are host to several species of non-pollinating chalcidoid wasps including Sycoscapter australis (Pteromalidae), Eukobelea hallami (Sycophaginae) and Meselatus sp. (Epichrysomallinae). The nematode species Schistonchus macrophylla and Schistonchus altermacrophylla are found in the syconia, where they parasitise P. froggattii. The thrips species Gynaikothrips australis feeds on the underside of new leaves of F. macrophylla, as well as those of F. rubiginosa and F. obliqua. As plant cells die, nearby cells are induced into forming meristem tissue and a gall results, and the leaves become distorted and curl over. The thrips begin feeding when the tree has flushes of new growth, and the life cycle is around six weeks. At other times, thrips reside on old leaves without feeding. The species pupates sheltered in the bark. The thrips remain in the galls at night and wander about in the daytime and return in the evening, possibly to different galls about the tree. Stressed trees can also be attacked by psyllids to the point of defoliation. Grubs hatch from eggs laid on the edges of leaves and burrow into the leaf to suck nutrients, the tree's own latex shielding the insect. Caterpillars of the moth species Lactura caminaea (Lacturidae) can strip trees of their leaves. The tree is also a host for the longhorn beetle (Cerambycidae) species Agrianome spinicollis. The fungal pathogen brown root rot (Phellinus noxius) has infected and killed this species. =Reproduction and life span= Pleistodontes froggatti, the fig wasp that pollinates the Moreton Bay fig Figs have an obligate mutualism with fig wasps (Agaonidae); figs are pollinated only by fig wasps, and fig wasps can reproduce only in fig flowers. Generally, each fig species depends on a single species of wasp for pollination. The wasps are similarly dependent on their fig species to reproduce. The mainland and Lord Howe populations of the Moreton Bay fig are both pollinated by Pleistodontes froggatti. As is the case with all figs, the fruit is actually an inverted inflorescence known as a syconium, with tiny flowers arising from the inner surface. Ficus macrophylla is monoecious‚Äîboth male and female flowers are found on the same plant, and, in fact, in the same fruit, although they mature at different times. Female wasps enter the syconium and lay eggs in the female flowers as they mature. These eggs later hatch and the progeny mate. The females of the new generation collect pollen from the male flowers, which have matured by this point, and leave to visit other syconia and repeat the process. A field study in Brisbane found that F. macrophylla trees often bore both male and female syconia at the same time‚Äîwhich could be beneficial for reproduction in isolated populations such as those on islands. The same study found that male phase syconia development persisted through the winter, showing that its wasp pollinator tolerated cooler weather than those of more tropical fig species. F. macrophylla itself can endure cooler climates than other fig species. Moreton Bay fig trees live for over 100 years in the wild. =Potentially invasive species= A young Moreton Bay fig starts life as an epiphyte in an Auckland, New Zealand park Ficus macrophylla is commonly cultivated in Hawaii and in northern New Zealand. In both places, it has now naturalised, having acquired its pollinating wasp (Pleistodontes froggatti). In Hawaii the wasp was deliberately introduced in 1921, and in New Zealand it was first recorded in 1993, having apparently arrived by long-distance dispersal from Australia. The arrival of the wasp led to prolific production of fruits containing many small seeds adapted for dispersal by birds. The Moreton Bay fig has been found growing on both native and introduced trees in New Zealand and in Hawaii. The size and vigour of this fig in New Zealand, and its lack of natural enemies, as well as its immunity to possum browsing, indicate that it may be able to invade forest and other native plant communities. Occasional garden escapees have been recorded in Turkey. Uses The Moreton Bay fig has been widely used in public parks in frost-free areas, and was popular with early settlers of Australia. Around the beginning of the 20th century, the director of the Royal Botanic Gardens in Sydney, Joseph Maiden, advocated the planting of street trees, generally uniform rows of the one species. He recommended Moreton Bay figs be spaced at intervals‚Äîfar enough to avoid crowding as the trees matured, but close enough so that their branches would eventually interlock. Specimens can reach massive proportions, and have thrived in drier climates; impressive specimen trees have been grown in the Waring Gardens in Deniliquin, and in Hay. They can withstand light frosts and can cope with salt-laden spray in coastal situations, and their fruit is beneficial for urban wildlife. However, their huge size precludes use in all but the largest gardens, and their roots are highly invasive and can damage piping and disrupt footpaths and roadways; the vast quantities of crushed fruit can be messy on the ground. The figs are edible but unpalatable and dry. Especially due to their tendency for root buttressing, they are frequently seen as bonsai, although they are much more suited to larger styles as their large leaves do not reduce much in size and their stems have long intervals (internodal spaces) between successive leaves. It can be used as an indoor plant in medium to brightly lit indoor spaces. The soft light timber has a wavy texture and is used for cases. Aboriginal people traditionally used the fibres for fishing nets. =Notable specimens= Trunk of F. macrophylla at Orto botanico di Palermo, showing buttressed roots The large trunk of the Ficus macrophylla and a bike (providing scale). Large specimens of Moreton Bay fig trees are found in many parks and properties throughout eastern and northeastern Australia. The Brisbane, Melbourne and Sydney botanical gardens contain numerous specimens planted in the middle of the 19th century. These trees are up to 35 metres (115 ft) tall. At Mount Keira, near Wollongong there is a Moreton Bay fig measured at tall. A notable tree in the Sydney suburb of Randwick, the 150-year-old \\"Tree of Knowledge\\", was controversially cut down in 2016 to make way for the CBD and South East Light Rail. There are many large specimens in New Zealand. A Moreton Bay fig at Pahi on the Kaipara Harbour, Northland, was measured in 1984 as high and wide, and in 2011 had a girth of . The Moreton Bay fig was introduced into cultivation into California in the United States in the 1870s, 13 specimens being classified as Exceptional Trees of Los Angeles in 1980. The tallest Ficus macrophylla in North America is adjacent to San Diego's Natural History Museum and was planted in 1914. By 1996 it stood high and across. The widest Moreton Bay fig in North America is Santa Barbara's Moreton Bay Fig Tree. It was planted in 1876, reportedly by a young girl who was given a seedling by an Australian sailor. It measures across. The Aoyama Tree stands between the Japanese American National Museum and the Temporary Contemporary in downtown Los Angeles. It was planted by Buddhist Japanese Americans in the early 20th century. Two South African specimens, in the Arderne Gardens in Claremont and the Pretoria Zoo respectively, have the widest and second-widest canopies of any single-stemmed trees in the country. The Pretoria specimen was planted before 1899, and was tall with a canopy width of by 2012. There is a notable specimen sprawling on steps at the Botanical Garden of the University of Coimbra, Portugal. Ficus macrophylla has been used in public spaces in Palermo in Sicily, with impressive specimens found in the Orto Botanico, the gardens of the Villa Garibaldi, Giardino Inglese, and in some squares.

History  = Early history = Jarvis Hall Collegiate School, and Matthews Divinity School Guggenheim Hall Engineering Hall, constructed in 1894 George R. Brown Hall houses various engineering disciplines, including mining. Paul Meyer Hall housed the Physics Department. It was demolished in Spring 2016 and replaced by the CoorsTek Center for Applied Science and Engineering. Alderson Hall, completed in 1953 and renovated in 1992, was named for former university president Victor C. Alderson (1903‚Äì1913 and 1917‚Äì1925) and houses the chemical engineering department. The CoorsTek Center for Applied Science and Engineering, opened to students in September 2017. It is the home building for the Physics Department, and the College of Applied Science and Engineering Dean's Office. Golden, Colorado, established in 1859 as Golden City, served as a supply center for miners and settlers in the area. In 1866, Bishop George M. Randall of Massachusetts arrived in the territory and, seeing a need for higher education facilities in the area, began planning for a university which would include a school of mines. In 1870, he opened the Jarvis Hall Collegiate School in the central building of the Colorado University Schools campus just south of the town of Golden, accompanied it with Matthews Hall divinity school in 1872, and in 1873 the School of Mines opened under the auspices of the Episcopal Church. In 1874 the School of Mines, supported by the territorial government since efforts began in 1870, was acquired by the territory and has been a state institution since 1876 when Colorado attained statehood. Tuition was originally free to residents of Colorado. The school's logo was designed by prominent architect Jacques Benedict. The first building on the current site of the school was built in 1880 with additions completed in 1882 and 1890. The building, known as \\"Chemistry Hall,\\" stood where Hill Hall is now located. The next building to be added to the campus was Engineering Hall, built in 1894, which is still in use today by the Economics and Business Division. Other firsts include the first Board of Trustees meeting held in 1879; the first formal commencement held in 1883 for two graduates (William Beebe Middleton and Walter Howard Wiley); the first international student graduated in 1889; and the first female student graduated in 1898. In 1906, Mines became the first school of its kind in the world to own and operate its own experimental mine, designed for practical teaching of the students, which was located on Mt. Zion and succeeded in the 1930s by the Edgar Mine. In 1879, there was some discussion about merging School of Mines and the State University in Boulder. Apparently, because of the specialized focus of School of Mines, it was decided that such a merger would not be appropriate. During the early years of the institution, the chief administrator was the \\"Professor in Charge\\". The designation \\"President\\" was first used in 1880. The \\"M\\" on Mt. Zion, a prominent feature in the Golden area, was constructed in 1908 and lighted in 1932. Early academic departments were drafting, physics, metallurgy, chemistry and mining. In the 1920s, departments formed in geology, petroleum engineering and geophysics. Petroleum refining was added in 1946. The Humanities, Arts and Social Sciences Division (formerly Liberal Arts and International Studies) and the Department of Physical Education and Athletics provide nontechnical educational opportunities for Mines students. Other facilities include: Ben Parker Student Center, Arthur Lakes Library, Green Center and the Edgar Mine which is located in Idaho Springs. = Recent history = The Colorado School of Mines is a public research university devoted to engineering and applied science. In August 2007, a new student recreation center was completed. In 2008, the school finished expanding its main computer center, the Center for Technology and Learning Media (CTLM).

One or two teams usually advance to the national finals, depending on the number of teams registered to compete. Mines also hosts the Colorado Regional Science Bowl, and shares hosting of the Colorado State MathCounts Competition with University of Denver, alternating biennially. Since 1964, the Colorado School of Mines has hosted the annual oil shale symposium, one of the most important international oil shale conferences. Although the series of symposia stopped after 1992, the tradition was restored in 2006. = Presidents =  Campus  Steinhauer Field House Colorado School of Mines is located to the southwest of Golden's downtown, bordered to the west by U.S. Route 6 and to the north by Clear Creek. The campus spans , including over a dozen academic and research buildings, indoor and outdoor athletic facilities, two student centers, a library, eight residential halls, and administration buildings. Additionally, the campus hosts a research building for the United States Geological Survey, housing the National Earthquake Information Center. The school operates the free admission Mines Museum of Earth Science, which displays rock and mineral specimens collected from Colorado's numerous mining districts as well as around the world. Notable objects in the collection include one of the \\"Goodwill\\" Apollo 17 lunar samples and the Miss Colorado crown.

Traditions  = E-Days = The 2010 Ore Cart Pull Each spring semester, the Colorado School of Mines students and faculty celebrate E-days (or Engineering Days). This three-day festival is kicked off Friday morning with the \\"Ore Cart Pull\\". This event consists of students collectively pulling an ore cart 7.5 miles down Colfax Avenue to the Colorado State Capitol in Civic Center Park. Other attractions of this event include a cardboard boat race down nearby Clear Creek, a concert featuring a community-voted artist, and a large fireworks show Saturday night to end the festival, among many other small campus-hosted events. = M Climb = Freshmen at the Colorado School of Mines are expected, but not required, to participate in the M Climb during orientation weekend. During this climb, students carry a ten-pound rock brought from their hometown up Mt. Zion. Before ascending up the mountain, students are given colored hard-hats which are spray-painted by members of the Blue Key Honor Society. Along the climb, non-freshmen encourage and heckle the new students with water balloons, silly string, and more, as well as leading the group in learning the Mines' fight song. At the top of the mountain, students place their rock on the \\"M,\\" a large sign made of rock in the shape of Mines' M logo, and paint the M white using whitewash. On graduation, seniors are invited to take a rock from the M as a keepsake of their time at Mines.  Athletics  The Colorado School of Mines' intercollegiate sports teams are known as the Orediggers. The Orediggers compete as members of NCAA Division II and the Rocky Mountain Athletic Conference for all 18 varsity sports. The Oredigger athletic teams include baseball, football, wrestling, men's and women's basketball, men's and women's cross country, men's golf, men's and women's soccer, softball, men's and women's swimming, men's and women's indoor/outdoor track and field, and women's volleyball.

Cyrus the Great (c. 600 or 576 ‚Äì 530 BC) figures in the Hebrew Bible as the patron and deliverer of the Jews. He is mentioned 23 times by name and alluded to several times more. ; , ; ; , , , ; , , , and 1 Esdras 2 . According to the Bible, Cyrus the Great, king of Persia, was the monarch under whom the Babylonian captivity ended. In the first year of his reign he was prompted by God to decree that the Temple in Jerusalem should be rebuilt and that such Jews as cared to might return to their land for this purpose. Moreover, he showed his interest in the project by sending back with them the sacred vessels which had been taken from the First Temple and a considerable sum of money with which to buy building materials. The existence of the decree has been challenged. Cyrus in Babylon and the Jewish connection Painting of Cyrus the Great with Daniel Cyrus the Great is unconditionally praised in the Jewish sources. It is likely that, after the Persian conquest of Babylon, Cyrus had commenced his relationship with the Jewish leaders in exile,Briant, P., From Cyrus to Alexander: a History of the Persian Empire, (Trans. version), Indiana (2002), p. 46. and that he later was considered as anointed by God.Isaiah 45:1 The Hebrew Bible states that Cyrus issued the decree of liberation to the Jews. Cyrus's edict for the rebuilding of the Temple in Jerusalem marked a great epoch in the history of the Jewish people. According to \\"the enemies of Judah and Benjamin\\" asked to help build the temple, and when this was denied hired counselors to frustrate the people of Judah from completing the rebuilding throughout the reign of Cyrus, Xerxes ('Ahasuerus'), and Artaxerxes, until the reign of Darius II. The work recommenced under the exhortations of the prophets, and when the authorities asked the Jews what right they had to build a temple, they referred to the decree of Cyrus. Darius II, who was then reigning, caused a search for this alleged decree to be made, and it was found in the archives at Ecbatana,Achmetha, whereupon Darius reaffirmed the decree and the work proceeded to its triumphant close. A chronicle drawn up just after the conquest of Babylonia by Cyrus gives the history of the reign of Nabonidus ('Nabuna'id'), the last king of Babylon, and of the fall of the Babylonian empire. In 538 BC, there was a revolt in Southern Babylonia, while the army of Cyrus entered the country from the north. In June the Babylonian army was completely defeated at Opis, and immediately afterwards Sippara opened its gates to the conqueror. Gobryas (Ugbaru), the governor of Media, was then sent to Babylon, which surrendered \\"without fighting,\\" and the daily services in the temples continued without a break. In October, Cyrus himself arrived, and proclaimed a general amnesty, which was communicated by Gobryas to \\"all the province of Babylon,\\" of which he had been made governor. Meanwhile, Nabonidus, who had concealed himself, was captured, but treated honourably; and when his wife died, Cambyses II, the son of Cyrus, conducted the funeral. Cyrus now assumed the title of \\"king of Babylon,\\" claimed to be the descendant of the ancient kings, and made rich offerings to the temples. At the same time he allowed the foreign populations who had been deported to Babylonia to return to their old homes, carrying with them the images of their gods. Among these populations were the Jews, who, as they had no images, took with them the sacred vessels of the temple. Speculation abounds as to the reasoning for Cyrus' release of the Jews from Babylon. One argument is that Cyrus was a follower of Zoroaster, the monotheistic prophet: Zoroastrianism played a dominant religious role in Persia throughout its history until the Islamic conquest. As such, he would have felt a kindred spirit with the monotheistic Jews. Another possibility is the magnanimous respect he is ascribed to have evinced for the diverse beliefs and customs of the peoples within his extended kingdom. As one example, upon the conquest of Babylon itself, it is recorded that he paid homage at the temple of the Babylonian god Marduk ‚Äì thereby gaining the support of the Babylonian people and minimizing further bloodshed. While Jewish tradition, as described previously in , indicates \\"the Lord inspired King Cyrus of Persia to issue this proclamation\\", in the Cyrus Cylinder he pays homage to Marduk. This Babylonian document has been interpreted as referring to the return to their homelands of several displaced cultural groups, one of which could have been the Jews: The Cyrus cylinder, which confirms that Cyrus allowed captives in Babylon to return to their native lands, earning him an honored place in Judaism. > From [Babylon] to A≈°≈°ur and (from) Susa, Agade, E≈°nunna, Zamban, Me-Turnu, > Der, as far as the region of Gutium, the sacred centers on the other side of > the Tigris, whose sanctuaries had been abandoned for a long time, I returned > the images of the gods, who had resided there, to their places and I let > them dwell in eternal abodes.

Vol. II: > Monumental Inscriptions from the Biblical World (2003, Leiden and Boston). However, it has been argued that it must be referring to people associated to the image's cult instead of deportees.A. Kuhrt, \\"The Cyrus Cylinder and Achaemenid Imperial Policy\\", p. 86‚Äì87, in Journal for the Study of the Old Testament 25 (1983). Diana Edelman has pointed at the serious chronological difficulties that arise when we accept that the Jews returned during the reign of Cyrus.Diana Edelman, The Origins of the Second Temple: Persian Imperial Policy and the Rebuilding of Jerusalem (2005) The terms used by the author of Deutero-Isaiah are reminiscent of certain passages in the Cyrus Cylinder: Traditionally, these passages in Isaiah were believed to predate the rule of Cyrus by about 100 years, however, most modern scholars date Isaiah 40‚Äì55 (often referred to as Deutero-Isaiah), toward the end of the Babylonian exile (c. 536 BC). Whereas Isaiah 1‚Äì39 (referred to as Proto-Isaiah) saw the destruction of Israel as imminent, and the restoration in the future, Deutero- Isaiah speaks of the destruction in the past (), and the restoration as imminent (). Notice, for example, the change in temporal perspective from (), where the Babylonian Captivity is cast far in the future, to (), where the Israelites are spoken of as already in Babylon. According to scholar R. N. Whybray, the author of Deutero-Isaiah (chapters 40‚Äì55) was mistaken for he thought that Cyrus would destroy Babylon but he did not. Cyrus made it more splendid than ever. But he did allow the Jewish exiles to return home, though not in the triumphant manner which Deutero-Isaiah expected. :Who roused from the east him that victory hails at every step? Who presents him with nations, subdues kings to him? His sword makes dust of them and his bow scatters them like straw. He pursues them and advances unhindered, his feet scarcely touching the road. Who is the author of this deed if not he who calls the generations from the beginning? I, the Lord, who am the first and shall be with the last. () Then the alliance between Cyrus and God is made explicit: :Thus says the Lord to his anointed, to Cyrus, whom he has taken by his right hand to subdue nations before him and strip the loins of kings, to force gateways before him that their gates be closed no more: I will go before you levelling the heights. I will shatter the bronze gateways, smash the iron bars. I will give you the hidden treasures, the secret hoards, that you may know that I am the Lord. () Among the classical Jewish sources, besides the Bible, Josephus (1st century AD) mentions that Cyrus freed the Jews from captivity and helped rebuild the temple. He also wrote to the rulers and governors that they should contribute to the rebuilding of the temple and assisted them in rebuilding the temple. A letter from Cyrus to the Jews is described by Josephus:The Works of Flavius Josephus, Translated by William Whiston HOW CYRUS, KING OF THE PERSIANS, DELIVERED THE JEWS OUT OF BABYLON AND SUFFERED THEM TO RETURN TO THEIR OWN COUNTRY AND TO BUILD THEIR TEMPLE, FOR WHICH WORK HE GAVE THEM MONEY. 1\\\\. In the first year of the reign of Cyrus (1) which was the seventieth from the day that our people were removed out of their own land into Babylon, God commiserated the captivity and calamity of these poor people, according as he had foretold to them by Jeremiah the prophet, before the destruction of the city, that after they had served Nebuchadnezzar and his posterity, and after they had undergone that servitude seventy years, he would restore them again to the land of their fathers, and they should build their temple, and enjoy their ancient prosperity. And these things God did afford them; for he stirred up the mind of Cyrus, and made him write this throughout all Asia: \\"Thus saith Cyrus the king: Since God Almighty hath appointed me to be king of the habitable earth, I believe that he is that God which the nation of the Israelites worship; for indeed he foretold my name by the prophets, and that I should build him a house at Jerusalem, in the country of Judea.\\" 2\\\\. This was known to Cyrus by his reading the book which Isaiah left behind him of his prophecies; for this prophet said that God had spoken thus to him in a secret vision: \\"My will is, that Cyrus, whom I have appointed to be king over many and great nations, send back my people to their own land, and build my temple.\\" This was foretold by Isaiah one hundred and forty years before the temple was demolished. Accordingly, when Cyrus read this, and admired the Divine power, an earnest desire and ambition seized upon him to fulfill what was so written; so he called for the most eminent Jews that were in Babylon, and said to them, that he gave them leave to go back to their own country, and to rebuild their city Jerusalem, (2) and the temple of God, for that he would be their assistant, and that he would write to the rulers and governors that were in the neighborhood of their country of Judea, that they should contribute to them gold and silver for the building of the temple, and besides that, beasts for their sacrifices. 3\\\\. When Cyrus had said this to the Israelites, the rulers of the two tribes of Judah and Benjamin, with the Levites and priests, went in haste to Jerusalem; yet did many of them stay at Babylon, as not willing to leave their possessions; and when they were come thither, all the king's friends assisted them, and brought in, for the building of the temple, some gold, and some silver, and some a great many cattle and horses. So they performed their vows to God, and offered the sacrifices that had been accustomed of old time; I mean this upon the rebuilding of their city, and the revival of the ancient practices relating to their worship. Cyrus also sent back to them the vessels of God which king Nebuchadnezzar had pillaged out of the temple, and had carried to Babylon. So he committed these things to Mithridates, the treasurer, to be sent away, with an order to give them to Sanabassar, that he might keep them till the temple was built; and when it was finished, he might deliver them to the priests and rulers of the multitude, in order to their being restored to the temple. Cyrus also sent an epistle to the governors that were in Syria, the contents whereof here follow: ‚ÄúKING CYRUS TO SISINNES AND SATHRABUZANES SENDETH GREETING. \\"I have given leave to as many of the Jews that dwell in my country as please to return to their own country, and to rebuild their city, and to build the temple of God at Jerusalem on the same place where it was before. I have also sent my treasurer Mithridates, and Zorobabel, the governor of the Jews, that they may lay the foundations of the temple, and may build it sixty cubits high, and of the same latitude, making three edifices of polished stones, and one of the wood of the country, and the same order extends to the altar whereon they offer sacrifices to God. I require also that the expenses for these things may be given out of my revenues. Moreover, I have also sent the vessels which king Nebuchadnezzar pillaged out of the temple, and have given them to Mithridates the treasurer, and to Zorobabel the governor of the Jews, that they may have them carried to Jerusalem, and may restore them to the temple of God. Now their number is as follows: Fifty chargers of gold, and five hundred of silver; forty Thericlean cups of gold, and five hundred of silver; fifty basons of gold, and five hundred of silver; thirty vessels for pouring [the drink-offerings], and three hundred of silver; thirty vials of gold, and two thousand four hundred of silver; with a thousand other large vessels. (3) I permit them to have the same honor which they were used to have from their forefathers, as also for their small cattle, and for wine and oil, two hundred and five thousand and five hundred drachme; and for wheat flour, twenty thousand and five hundred artabae; and I give order that these expenses shall be given them out of the tributes due from Samaria. The priests shall also offer these sacrifices according to the laws of Moses in Jerusalem; and when they offer them, they shall pray to God for the preservation of the king and of his family, that the kingdom of Persia may continue. But my will is, that those who disobey these injunctions, and make them void, shall be hung upon a cross, and their substance brought into the king's treasury.\\" And such was the import of this epistle. Now the number of those that came out of captivity to Jerusalem, were forty-two thousand four hundred and sixty-two.\\". =Authenticity of the decree= The historical nature of this decree has been challenged. Professor Lester L. Grabbe has argued that there was no decree but that there was a policy that allowed exiles to return to their homelands and rebuild their temples. He also argues that the archaeology suggests that the return was a \\"trickle\\" taking place over perhaps decades, resulting in a maximum population of perhaps 30,000.

In addition to his own recordings as leader, Knepper performed and recorded with Charlie Barnet, Woody Herman, Claude Thornhill, Stan Kenton, Benny Goodman, Gil Evans, Thad Jones and Mel Lewis, Toshiko Akiyoshi and Lew Tabackin, and, most famously, Charles Mingus in the late 1950s and early 1960s. Knepper died in 2003 of complications of Parkinson's disease. Biography Knepper was born in Los Angeles, California, the second son of a nurse and a police officer. His parents divorced shortly after his birth, and his mother had to take her abusive husband to court in order to get child support. He and his older brother, Robert, were sent to several boarding and military schools, Page Military Academy and St. John's Military Academy, while their mother worked. He picked up his first instrument, an alto horn, at the age of 6 while he was a pupil there. His first teacher persuaded him to put aside the alto and pick up the trombone because, as he said, he had a \\"trombone mouth\\". He played his first professional gigs in LA, and traveled to Spokane, WA at the age of 15. He graduated high school, and later attended classes at Los Angeles Community College. Knepper married Maxine Helen Fields, a trumpet player with the all-female jazz band the International Sweethearts of Rhythm on May 8, 1954, at a civil ceremony in Tucson, Arizona, while he was on a tour with the Maynard Ferguson Band. They had two children, a daughter, Robin Reid Knepper Mahonen, and a son, Timothy Jay Knepper, who predeceased him. Knepper chose the names \\"Robin\\" and \\"Jay\\" to honor his idol, Charlie Parker, whom the jazz world knew as \\"Bird\\". He had four grandchildren. In 1959, the U.S. State Department funded a trip for bandleader Herbie Mann to visit Africa, after they heard his version of \\"African Suite.\\" In a stroke of serendipity, Jimmy Knepper replaced Willie Dennis as trombonist in the band for this tour. The grueling 14-week tour took place from 12/31/1959 to 4/5/1960. The musicians were: Herbie Mann, bandleader, flute and sax; Johnny Rae, vibist and arranger; Don Payne, bass; Doc Cheatham, trumpet; Jimmy Knepper, trombone; Carlos \\"Patato\\" Valdes, conguero; Jose Mangual, bongos. Destinations listed on official itinerary: Sierra Leone, Liberia, Nigeria, Mozambique, Rhodesia, Tanganyika, Kenya, Ethiopia, Sudan, Morocco, Tunisia. Knepper documented this tour meticulously in a series of letters he sent home to his wife, Maxine, his daughter, Robin, and his son, Timothy. These letters were recently found carefully preserved in a dusty box in the attic of the family home, and have now been transcribed by his daughter. They provide a fascinating glimpse into the inner circles of a notable piece of jazz history, and the life of a touring musician, who was also a devoted family man. He paints vivid portraits of the personal life of the musicians he worked with, and his descriptions of the Africa's landscapes and people provide a vivid portrait of an era in which there were few civil rights for Africans in their own lands. Knepper's daughter is hoping to publish these letters in the near future. In 1962, Knepper toured the Soviet Union with Benny Goodman's Big Band, as part of a cultural exchange during the Cold War, in which the Bolshoi Ballet also came to the US. This groundbreaking yet disastrous tour was also documented in Knepper's letters. Knepper also played in the pit orchestra through the entire run of the Broadway show Funny Girl, with Barbra Streisand, and later, Mimi Hines. After seventeen previews, the Broadway production opened on March 26, 1964, at the Winter Garden Theatre, subsequently transferring to the Majestic Theatre and the Broadway Theatre to complete its total run of 1,348 performances. In 1967 and 1968, he played in the pit orchestra at the Mark Hellinger Theater for \\"An Evening with Marlene Dietrich\\", for which Dietrich received a special Tony award in 1968. He also appeared on and off Broadway in \\"On Your Toes\\", and \\"The Me Nobody Knows\\". While he was playing Funny Girl, Knepper became a member of the Thad Jones/Mel Lewis Orchestra, a big band formed by trumpeter Thad Jones and drummer Mel Lewis around 1965, which began the 40-year tradition of Monday night jazz shows at the Village Vanguard in NYC's Greenwich Village. The band performed for twelve years in its original incarnation, but since the death of Lewis in 1990 it has been known as the Vanguard Jazz Orchestra. They have maintained a Monday-night residency at the Village Vanguard for four decades. Knepper again toured the USSR, this time with TJML, as well as Japan and Europe with them, and appeared with them at the Montreux Jazz Festival in 1974. In 1969, Knepper toured and recorded \\"You Never Know Who Your Friends Are\\", with keyboardist Al Kooper, in the jazz period which followed his departure from Blood, Sweat and Tears. Knepper appeared on this concert tour which included shows at the Philadelphia Spectrum, and in Atlanta, where he briefly met Janis Joplin. In 1980, he received a Grammy nomination from The National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences, for \\"Best Jazz Instrumentalist Performance, Soloist\\", for his original album, \\"Cunningbird\\". Knepper received \\"Best Trombonist\\" award from Downbeat Magazine Reader's Poll four years running from 1981 to 1984; he also achieved first place in the Downbeat Critics' Poll in 1981, and then five years running from 1983 to 1987. With Mingus Although Knepper worked with some of the most notable jazz musicians of the 20th century, he was perhaps best known for his collaboration and stormy relationship with bassist and composer, Charles Mingus. Mingus' temper was notoriously bad, and he twice hit Knepper. Once, while onstage at a memorial concert in Philadelphia, Mingus reportedly attempted to crush the hands of his pianist, Toshiko Akiyoshi, with the instrument's keyboard cover, then punched Knepper. Later, Mingus reportedly punched Knepper in the mouth while the two men were working together at Mingus's apartment on a score for Epitaph, in preparation for what became his disastrous concert at New York Town Hall, on October 12, 1962. The blow broke one of Knepper's teeth, ruined his embouchure and resulted in the loss of the top octave of his range on the trombone for almost two years. This attack ended their working relationship and Knepper was unable to perform at the concert. Charged with assault, Mingus appeared in court in January 1963 and was given a suspended sentence. According to his daughter, Robin, Mingus also later mailed heroin to Knepper's home, and made an anonymous phone call to the police. A little girl at the time, she remembers the police questioning her father after the mailman delivered the package.\\"Goodbye\\" ‚Äì farewell essay at jazznation.com Nevertheless, in the 1970s, the two eventually reconciled thoroughly enough to play together in concert and on at least one of Mingus' last albums. Following Mingus' death, and the death of the first Mingus Dynasty bandleader, drummer Dannie Richmond, Knepper led the Mingus Dynasty Orchestra, and toured the Middle East and Europe.

Yan (; Old Chinese pronunciation: *) was an ancient Chinese state during the Zhou dynasty. Its capital was Ji (later known as Yanjing and now Beijing). During the Warring States period, the court was also moved to another capital at Xiadu at times. The history of Yan began in the Western Zhou in the early first millennium BC. After the authority of the Zhou king declined during the Spring and Autumn period in the 8th century BC, Yan survived and became one of the strongest states in China. During the Warring States period from the 5th to 3rd centuries BC, Yan was one of the last states to be conquered by the armies of Qin Shihuang: Yan fell in 222 BC, the year before the declaration of the Qin Empire. Yan experienced a brief period of independence after the collapse of the Qin dynasty in 207 BC, but it was eventually absorbed by the victorious Han. Yan stretched from the Yellow River (at the time, the river followed a more northerly course than at present) to the Yalu River and from the mountains of Shanxi to the Liaodong Peninsula. As the most north-eastern of all the Chinese states during this time period, Yan faced incursions from steppe nomads and built great walls. History According to Sima Qian's Records of the Grand Historian, King Wu of Zhou deposed King Zhou of Shang at the Battle of Muye (c. 1046 BC) and conferred titles to nobles within his domain, including the rulers of the Yan.ËìüÂüéÁ∫™ÂøµÊü± In the 11th century BC, Yan's capital was based in what is now Liulihe Township, Fangshan District, Beijing, where a large walled settlement and over 200 tombs of nobility have been unearthed. Among the most significant artifacts from the Liulihe Site is a bronze ding with inscriptions that recount the journey of the eldest son of the Duke of Yan, who delivered offerings to the King of Zhou in present-day Xi'an and was awarded a position in the king's court. Some time during the 7th century BC in the late Western Zhou or early Eastern Zhou, Yan absorbed the State of Ji, a smaller kingdom to the north and moved its capital to that of Ji in modern-day Xicheng District, Beijing. To the south, the bordering states of Zhao and Qi were Yan's main rivals. The mountainous border in the west between Zhao and Yan became the area in which their armies often clashed. Despite this, the war between Zhao and Yan usually dragged on into a stalemate, requiring the help of other kingdoms to conclude. At the turn of the 3rd century BC, General Qin Kai launched a series of campaigns against the Donghu and Gojoseon, expanding the kingdom's frontiers nearly one thousand kilometers east to northwestern Korean Peninsula. A Great Wall was constructed on Yan's new northern borders, and five commanderies, Shanggu, Yuyang, Youbeiping, Liaoxi and Liaodong, were subsequently established for the defense against the Donghu. The Central Plains states seemed to hold Yan culture and other peripheral states like Qin in low regard. Archaeological discoveries in the state of Yan have uncovered ornaments that, while inscribed with Chinese writing, were close in style to that of the northern nomadic tribes. The currency of Yan was crafted into the shape of a knife, a form closely associated with the nomads. This form of currency might have been specially made for trade with the nomads, demonstrating the importance of commercial relations with them. The strongest opposition came from the Qi, one of the strongest states in China. A succession crisis started in Yan in 325 BC when king Zikuai symbolically resigned his throne in favor of his minister Zizhi to prove his humility; the minister took advantage and seized power. While this crisis happened, in 314 BC Qi invaded and in a little over several months practically conquered the country. However, due to the misconduct of Qi troops during the conquest of Yan a revolt eventually drove them away and the borders of Yan were restored. Yan's new king, King Zhao of Yan then plotted with the states of Zhao, Qin, Han and Wei for a joint expedition against Qi. Led by the brilliant tactician Yue Yi, it was highly successful and within a year most of Qi's seventy walled cities had fallen, with the exception of Zimu and Lu. However, with the death of King Zhao and the expulsion of Yue Yi to Zhao by the new king, King Wei of Yan, General Tian Dan managed to recapture all of the cities from the 5 kingdoms. Despite the wars, Yan survived through the Warring States period. In 227 BC, with Qin troops on the border after the collapse of Zhao, Crown Prince Dan sent an assassin named Jing Ke to kill the king of Qin (later Qin Shi Huang), hoping to end the Qin threat. The mission failed, with Jing Ke dying at the hands of the King of Qin in Xianyang. Surprised and enraged by such a bold act, the king of Qin called on Wang Jian to destroy Yan. Crushing the bulk of the Yan army at the frozen Yi River, Ji fell the following year and the ruler, King Xi, fled to the Liaodong Peninsula. In 222 BC, Liaodong fell as well, and Yan was overrun by Qin. Yan was the third last state to fall, and with its destruction the fates of the remaining two kingdoms were sealed. In 221 BC, Qin conquered all of China, ending the Warring States period and founding the Qin dynasty. =Post-Qin interregnum= In 207 BC, the Qin dynasty collapsed and China resumed a state of civil war. King Wu Chen of Zhao eventually sent General Han Guang to conquer Yan for Zhao, but upon his conquest, Han Guang appointed himself King of Yan. Han Guang had sent General Zang Tu to assist Xiang Yu, the king of Chu, in his war against Qin. When Zang Tu returned, Han Guang was ordered to become King of Liaodong instead. When Han Guang refused, Zang Tu killed him and declared himself King of both Yan and Liaodong. Zang Tu submitted Yan to the Han dynasty during the war between Han and Chu in order to keep his title, but once the war was finished he revolted. Liu Bang (later Emperor Gaozu of Han) sent Fan Kuai and Zhou Bo to put down the rebellion, and they captured and executed Zang Tu. His son Zang Yan fled to exile among the Xiongnu. Lu Wan became the new King of Yan and reigned there for most of Liu Bang's life, until the emperor discovered that he had sent officials to the courts of the rebel Chen Xi and the Xiongnu chanyu Modu. Summoned to the imperial court, Lu Wan feigned illness and then fled to the Xiongnu, who honored him as the King of the Eastern Nomads (Donghu) until his death. In the meantime, Yan came under direct control of the Han dynasty and was treated as a princely appanage.

Culture and society Before the state of Qin unified China in 221 BC, each region had its own unique customs and culture, although all were dominated by an upper class that shared a largely common culture. In the Yu Gong (Tribute of Yu), a section of the Book of Documents which was most likely composed in the 4th century BC, the author describes a China that is divided into nine regions, each with its own distinctive culture and products. The core theme of this section is that these nine regions are unified into one state by the travels of the eponymous sage, Yu the Great and by sending each region's unique goods to the capital as tribute. Other texts also discussed these regional variations in culture and physical environments. One of these texts was The Book of Master Wu, written in response to a query by Marquis Wu of Wei on how to cope with the other states. Wu Qi, the author of the work, declared that the government and nature of the people were reflective of the terrain they live in.

It is part of the Dongfeng Aerospace City (Base 10). Although the facility is geographically located within Ejin Banner of Inner Mongolia's Alxa League, it is named after the nearest city, Jiuquan in Gansu Province.  History  It was founded in 1958, the first of China's four spaceports. More Chinese launches have occurred at Jiuquan than anywhere else. As with all Chinese launch facilities it is remote and generally closed to foreigners. The Satellite Launch Center is a part of Dongfeng space city (), also known as Base 10 () or Dongfeng base (), which also includes PLAAF test flight facilities, a space museum and a martyr's cemetery (). JSLC is usually used to launch vehicles into lower and medium orbits with large orbital inclination angles, as well as testing medium to long-range missiles. Its facilities are state of the art and provide support to every phase of a satellite launch campaign. The site includes the Technical Center, the Launch Complex, the Launch Control Center, the Mission Command and Control Center and various other logistical support systems. The center covers 2800 km¬≤ and may have housing for as many as 20,000 people. The facilities and launch support equipment were likely modelled on Soviet counterparts and the Soviet Union has likely provided technical support to Jiuquan. The launch center has been the focus of many of China's ventures into space, including their first satellite Dong Fang Hong 1 in 1970, and their first crewed space mission Shenzhou 5 on 15 October 2003. Shenzhou 6, the second crewed spaceflight of China, launched on 12 October 2005 on a Long March rocket from JSLC. Shenzhou 7, the third crewed spaceflight mission of the Chinese space program, was launched from JSLC on 25 September 2008 by a Long March 2F (CZ-2F) rocket. The mission, which included an extra-vehicular activity (EVA) carried out by crewmembers Zhai Zhigang and Liu Boming, marked the commencement of the second phase of the Chinese government's Project 921. China's fourth crewed spaceflight, Shenzhou 9, launched from JSLC on 16 June 2012 at 18:37 local time (10:37 UTC). The 13-day mission included China's first female astronaut and docked with the country's Tiangong-1 space station module on Monday, 18 June 2012.Chinese Long March 2F/G launches Shenzhou-9 on historic mission, NASASpaceflight.com, June 16, 2012 In August 2016, China launched the first quantum communication satellite, the \\"Quantum Experiments at Space Scale\\", from the Center. In August 2018, Chinese private rocket manufacturing startups i-Space and OneSpace launched sub-orbital rockets from the center. On July 25, 2019, the first Chinese private orbital launch took place from Jiuquan as I-Space launched their Hyberbola-1 rocket.

He composed the jazz and pop standards \\"Snowfall\\" and \\"I Wish I Had You\\". Early years Thornhill was the son of J. Chester Thornhill and his wife, Maude. When he was 11 years old, he played piano professionally. While still a youth, he played with two local combos. As a student at Garfield High School in Terre Haute, he played with several theater bands. Thornhill entered the Cincinnati Conservatory of Music at the age of 16. He also studied at the Curtis Institute of Music in Philadelphia. Career As a youth, he was recognized as an extraordinary talent and formed a traveling duo with Danny Polo, a musical prodigy on the clarinet and trumpet from nearby Clinton, Indiana. He and clarinetist Artie Shaw started their careers at the Golden Pheasant in Cleveland, Ohio, with the Austin Wylie Orchestra. Thornhill and Shaw went to New York together in 1931. Thornhill went to the West Coast in the late 1930s with the Bob Hope Radio Show and arranged for Judy Garland in Babes in Arms. In 1935, he played on sessions with Glenn Miller, including \\"Solo Hop\\", which was released on Columbia Records. He also played with Paul Whiteman, Benny Goodman, Ray Noble, and Billie Holiday. He arranged \\"Loch Lomond\\" and \\"Annie Laurie\\" for Maxine Sullivan. During the mid-1930s, Thornhill arranged and played piano for Andre Kostelanetz. In 1939 he founded the Claude Thornhill Orchestra. Polo was his lead clarinet player. Although the Thornhill band was a sophisticated dance band, it became known for its superior jazz musicians and for Thornhill's and Gil Evans's arrangements. The band played without vibrato so that the timbres of the instruments could be better appreciated. Thornhill encouraged the musicians to develop cool-sounding tones. The band was popular with both musicians and the public. Miles Davis's Birth of the Cool nonet was modeled in part on Thornhill's sound and unconventional instrumentation. The band's most successful records were \\"Snowfall\\", \\"A Sunday Kind of Love\\", and \\"Love for Love\\". Thornhill was playing at the Paramount Theater in New York for $10,000 a week when he enlisted in the U.S. Navy as an apprentice seaman on October 26, 1942. As chief musician, he performed shows across the Pacific Theater with Jackie Cooper as his drummer and Dennis Day as his vocalist. In 1946, he was discharged from the Navy and reunited his ensemble. Polo, Gerry Mulligan, and Barry Galbraith returned with new members, Red Rodney, Lee Konitz, Joe Shulman, and Bill Barber. Thornhill and his orchestra played for the Judy, Jill and Johnny variety program on radio on the Mutual Broadcasting System in 1946-1947. In 1957, Thornhill became Tony Bennett's musical director. He offered his big band library to Gerry Mulligan when Mulligan formed the Concert Jazz Band, but Mulligan declined the gift, since his instrumentation was different. A large portion of his extensive library of music is currently held by Drury University in Springfield, Missouri. Thornhill died of a heart attack in Caldwell, New Jersey, at the age of 56. In 1984, he was posthumously inducted into the Big Band and Jazz Hall of Fame.

Hence a genetic screen is a type of phenotypic screen. Genetic screens can provide important information on gene function as well as the molecular events that underlie a biological process or pathway. While genome projects have identified an extensive inventory of genes in many different organisms, genetic screens can provide valuable insight as to how those genes function.  Basic screening  Forward genetics (or a forward genetic screen) is an approach used to identify genes (or set of genes) responsible for a particular phenotype of an organism. Reverse genetics (or a reverse genetic screen), on the other hand, analyzes the phenotype of an organism following the disruption of a known gene. In short, forward genetics starts with a phenotype and moves towards identifying the gene(s) responsible, whereas reverse genetics starts with a known gene and assays the effect of its disruption by analyzing the resultant phenotypes. Both forward and reverse genetic screens aim to determine gene function. Successful forward genetic screens often have two key components. The first is a defined genetic background of the organism being used and the second is a simple yet constant experimental procedure to identify mutants of interest. Defined genetic backgrounds allow researchers to identify and locate affected genes in mutant individuals with greater efficiency. A simplified screening method is beneficial because it allows for a larger number of individuals to be screened, thereby increasing the probability of generating and identifying mutants of interest. Since natural allelic mutations are rare, prior to screening geneticists often mutagenize a population of individuals by exposing them to a known mutagen, such as a chemical or radiation, thereby generating a much higher frequency of chromosomal mutations. In some organisms mutagens can be useful for performing saturation screens. Saturation screens are used to uncover all genes involved in a particular phenotype of an organism or species. The screen is carried out by mapping mutants of a biological process until no new genes/gene mutations can be found. Christiane N√ºsslein-Volhard and Eric Wieschaus were the first individuals to perform this type of screening procedure.  Screening variations  Many screening variations have been devised to elucidate a gene that leads to a mutant phenotype of interest. = Enhancer = An enhancer screen begins with a mutant individual that has an affected process of interest with a known gene mutation. The screen can then be used to identify additional genes or gene mutations that play a role in that biological or physiological process. A genetic enhancer screen identifies mutations which enhance a phenotype of interest in an already mutant individual. The phenotype of the double mutant (individual with both the enhancer and original background mutation) is more prominent than either of the single mutant phenotypes. The enhancement must surpass the expected phenotypes of the two mutations on their own, and therefore each mutation may be considered an enhancer of the other. Isolating enhancer mutants can lead to the identification of interacting genes or genes which act redundantly with respect to one another. = Suppressor = A suppressor screen is used to identify suppressor mutations which alleviate or revert the phenotype of the original mutation, in a process defined as synthetic viability. Suppressor mutations can be described as second mutations at a site on the chromosome distinct from the mutation under study, which suppress the phenotype of the original mutation. If the mutation is in the same gene as the original mutation it is known as intragenic suppression, whereas a mutation located in a different gene is known as extragenic suppression or intergenic suppression. Suppressor mutations are extremely useful to define the functions of biochemical pathways within a cell and the relationships between different biochemical pathways. = Temperature sensitive = A temperature sensitive screen involves performing temperature shifts to enhance a mutant phenotype. A population grown at low temperature would have a normal phenotype; however, the mutation in the particular gene would make it unstable at a higher temperature. A screen for temperature sensitivity in fruit flies, for example, might involve raising the temperature in the cage until some flies faint, then opening a portal to let the others escape. Individuals selected in a screen are liable to carry an unusual version of a gene involved in the phenotype of interest. An advantage of alleles found in this type of screen is that the mutant phenotype is conditional and can be activated by simply raising the temperature. A null mutation in such a gene may be lethal to the embryo and such mutants would be missed in a basic screen. A famous temperature sensitive screen was carried out independently by Lee Hartwell and Paul Nurse to identify mutants defective in cell cycle in S. cerevisiae and S. pombe, respectively.  Mapping mutants  By the classical genetics approach, a researcher would then locate (map) the gene on its chromosome by crossbreeding with individuals that carry other unusual traits and collecting statistics on how frequently the two traits are inherited together. Classical geneticists would have used phenotypic traits to map the new mutant alleles. With the advent of genomic sequences for model systems such as Drosophila melanogaster, Arabidopsis thaliana and C. elegans many single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) have now been identified that can be used as traits for mapping. In fact, the Heidelberg screen, which was developed in 1980 by N√ºsslein-Volhard and Wieschaus cleared the way for future scientists in this field. SNPs are the preferred traits for mapping since they are very frequent, on the order of one difference per 1000 base pairs, between different varieties of organism. Mutagens such as random DNA insertions by transformation or active transposons can also be used to generate new mutants. These techniques have the advantage of tagging the new alleles with a known molecular (DNA) marker that can facilitate the rapid identification of the gene.  Positional cloning  Positional cloning is a method of gene identification in which a gene for a specific phenotype is identified only by its approximate chromosomal location (but not the function); this is known as the candidate region. Initially, the candidate region can be defined using techniques such as linkage analysis, and positional cloning is then used to narrow the candidate region until the gene and its mutations are found. Positional cloning typically involves the isolation of partially overlapping DNA segments from genomic libraries to progress along the chromosome toward a specific gene. During the course of positional cloning, one needs to determine whether the DNA segment currently under consideration is part of the gene. Tests used for this purpose include cross-species hybridization, identification of unmethylated CpG islands, exon trapping, direct cDNA selection, computer analysis of DNA sequence, mutation screening in affected individuals, and tests of gene expression. For genomes in which the regions of genetic polymorphisms are known, positional cloning involves identifying polymorphisms that flank the mutation. This process requires that DNA fragments from the closest known genetic marker are progressively cloned and sequenced, getting closer to the mutant allele with each new clone. This process produces a contig map of the locus and is known as chromosome walking. With the completion of genome sequencing projects such as the Human Genome Project, modern positional cloning can use ready-made contigs from the genome sequence databases directly. For each new DNA clone a polymorphism is identified and tested in the mapping population for its recombination frequency compared to the mutant phenotype. When the DNA clone is at or close to the mutant allele, the recombination frequency should be close to zero. If the chromosome walk proceeds through the mutant allele, the new polymorphisms will start to show increase in recombination frequency compared to the mutant phenotype. Depending on the size of the mapping population, the mutant allele can be narrowed down to a small region (<30 Kb). Sequence comparison between wild type and mutant DNA in that region is then required to locate the DNA mutation that causes the phenotypic difference. Modern positional cloning can more directly extract information from genomic sequencing projects and existing data by analyzing the genes in the candidate region. Potential disease genes from the candidate region can then be prioritized, potentially reducing the amount of work involved. Genes with expression patterns consistent with the disease phenotype, showing a (putative) function related to the phenotype, or homologous to another gene linked to the phenotype are all priority candidates. Generalization of positional cloning techniques in this manner is also known as positional gene discovery. Positional cloning is an effective method to isolate disease genes in an unbiased manner, and it has been used to identify disease genes for Duchenne muscular dystrophy, Huntington's disease, and cystic fibrosis. However, complications in the analysis arise if the disease exhibits locus heterogeneity.

Biography Salgado was born on February 8, 1944 in Aimor√©s, in the state of Minas Gerais, Brazil. After a somewhat itinerant childhood, Salgado initially trained as an economist, earning a master‚Äôs degree in economics from the University of S√£o Paulo in Brazil. He began work as an economist for the International Coffee Organization, often traveling to Africa on missions for the World Bank, when he first started seriously taking photographs. He chose to abandon a career as an economist and switched to photography in 1973, working initially on news assignments before veering more towards documentary-type work. Salgado initially worked with the photo agency Sygma and the Paris-based Gamma, but in 1979, he joined the international cooperative of photographers Magnum Photos. He left Magnum in 1994 and with his wife L√©lia Wanick Salgado formed his own agency, Amazonas Images, in Paris, to represent his work. He is particularly noted for his social documentary photography of workers in less developed nations. They reside in Paris. He has been a UNICEF Goodwill Ambassador since 2001. Salgado works on long term, self-assigned projects many of which have been published as books: The Other Americas, Sahel, Workers, Migrations, and Genesis. The latter three are mammoth collections with hundreds of images each from all around the world. His most famous pictures are of a gold mine in Brazil called Serra Pelada. Reforestation of Fazenda Bulc√£o, or Bulc√£o Farm, by Instituto Terra Together, L√©lia and Sebasti√£o have worked since the 1990s on the restoration of a part of the Atlantic Forest in Brazil. In 1998, they succeeded in turning 17,000 acres into a nature reserve and created the Instituto Terra. The institute is dedicated to a mission of reforestation, conservation and environmental education. Between 2004 and 2011, Salgado worked on Genesis, aiming at the presentation of the unblemished faces of nature and humanity. It consists of a series of photographs of landscapes and wildlife, as well as of human communities that continue to live in accordance with their ancestral traditions and cultures. This body of work is conceived as a potential path to humanity‚Äôs rediscovery of itself in nature. In September and October 2007, Salgado displayed his photographs of coffee workers from India, Guatemala, Ethiopia and Brazil at the Brazilian Embassy in London. The aim of the project was to raise public awareness of the origins of the popular drink. Salgado and his work are the focus of the film The Salt of the Earth (2014), directed by Wim Wenders and Salgado's son, Juliano Ribeiro Salgado, and produced by L√©lia Wanick Salgado.

Armstrong, founder of the Worldwide Church of God, at the time a Sabbatarian organization that taught observance of seventh-day Sabbath, and annual Sabbath days based on Leviticus 23. Armstrong initially became recognized when he succeeded his father as the voice of The World Tomorrow, the church's radio program that aired around the world. A television program of the same name followed, aired mostly in North America, eventually giving way to a Garner Ted Armstrong broadcast, a half- hour program that mixed news and biblical commentary. His polemical message was unlike that of most other religious broadcasters of his day. Brief biography Armstrong's genealogy is described in his father's autobiography. The elder Armstrong reported that the Armstrong ancestors arrived in America in the late 17th century with William Penn. The ancestry was traced to Edward I of England. Armstrong's grandmother was \\"something like a third cousin to former President Herbert Hoover\\". Armstrong was born in Portland, Oregon, to Loma Isabelle (Dillon) and Herbert W. Armstrong. He was raised in Eugene, Oregon. He was the youngest of four children. He was named for a great- grandmother on his mother's side, Martha Garner, who was born in Suffolk, England in 1841 and died in Iowa in 1923, seven years before he was born. Following service in the United States Navy during the Korean War, Armstrong returned to Pasadena, California, where his father had moved the church's operations in 1946. He was baptized in early 1953 (Origin and History, p. 36). He enrolled in Ambassador College, founded by his father and supported by the church. Ambassador was not regionally accredited, and Armstrong eventually completed bachelor's, master's, and doctoral degrees in the only discipline offered, theology. He was ordained a minister in 1955 and held key administrative posts in both the Worldwide Church of God and Ambassador College until he was disfellowshipped (excommunicated) by his father in 1978. Prior to his removal, he was executive vice president of the church and president of the college, and was widely considered to be heir-apparent to succeed his father as head of the church and its operations. =Personality= Feast of Tabernacles in San Antonio, Texas, 1979 Armstrong was described as \\"movie star handsome\\" and was noted for his broadcasting talents. In radio and TV programs he mixed political, economic, and social news of the day with religious commentary. He was noted for adding \\"wry humor\\" into sermons that preached about the biblical prophesied return of Jesus Christ to the Earth. In 1975, Garner Ted Armstrong arranged for his friend, Hee Haw co-host Buck Owens to entertain attendees on Family Night at the annual fall Feast of Tabernacles church convention. Buck Owens, and his band the Buckaroos, traveled to five U.S. Feast of Tabernacles sites and performed before about 15 thousand people. The concerts were attended by festival attendees and were also open to the general public. To reciprocate, in 1976 Owens asked Armstrong to guest star on the Hee Haw show that starred Buck Owens and Roy Clark. He popped up out of the \\"corn patch\\" on the show to say \\"Sa-loot\\" to his hometown of Eugene, Oregon. He sang a country western song he had written titled \\"Working Man‚Äôs Hall of Fame,\\" and joined \\"the whole Hee Haw gang\\" to sing the popular Ocean gospel song Put Your Hand in the Hand. Country music star Merle Haggard said his most popular song \\"Okie From Muskogee\\" was inspired by listening to a Garner Ted Armstrong radio program of The World Tomorrow. Ministry Armstrong was ordained to the ministry by his father in 1955. G. T. Armstrong later reported in a sermon that he did not want to be a minister, to which his father answered something to the effect that because he did not want to enter the ministry that was a sign that he should. In 1957, he began to take over much of his father's broadcasting responsibilities. During that same year, he traveled extensively through South America. As a fluent Spanish speaker, he made several Spanish-language broadcasts of the World Tomorrow. The decade of the 1970s brought a series of reversals for Armstrong's career, however. An article in the Los Angeles Times reported that \\"The rift between the father and his heir apparent began in 1972 when Herbert Armstrong ousted his son from the church for four months, after an extra-marital affair, saying the son was \\"in the bonds of Satan.\\" The year 1972 had been prominent in Herbert W. Armstrong's prophetic views, as elaborated in a booklet called 1975 in Prophecy!. January 1972 was supposed to be the conclusion of the second of two 19-year \\"time cycles\\" which, according to the elder Armstrong, had begun in 1953 when The World Tomorrow began to be heard over Radio Luxembourg in Europe. According to his theory, at the conclusion of that second 19-year time cycle the members of the church were expected to flee to a place of refuge, which leading ministers had speculated could be the ancient city of Petra, carved into rock in Jordan. Following this flight, World War III supposedly would begin, with a United States of Europe rising up to overthrow both the United States of America and the United Kingdom. This fitted with both of the Armstrongs' teachings of a theory generally referred to as British Israelism, outlined in the elder Armstrong's book The United States and Britain in Prophecy. When the church's speculative prophecies about 1972 and 1975 did not occur, Armstrong proposed dropping such an approach in favor of one centered on Christian living and an outline of church doctrines and practice. Nevertheless, by 1977, Armstrong's media exposure included a daily radio program broadcast on over 300 radio stations across the United States, 33 in Australia, and 11 in the Philippines, with other programs throughout the world rebroadcast in the German, Spanish, French, Italian, and Russian languages. With an annual television budget of six million dollars, his exposure also included television programs which appeared on up to 165 channels. For almost two years this included a daily television appearance. According to Armstrong, notables such as President Lyndon B. Johnson, Nelson Rockefeller, Cyrus Vance and Hubert Humphrey, as well as a number of U.S. senators were frequent viewers of the broadcast. President Johnson personally told Armstrong during an afternoon lunch the two men had at Johnson's Texas ranch, quote \\"I watch your show (The World Tomorrow (radio and television)) all the time and I agree with most of what you have to say\\".Armstrong, Garner Ted, \\"Are We Relevant?\\" sermon delivered on November 19, 1988 (Church of God, International). Senator Bob Dole requested all copies of Armstrong's 1970's World Tomorrow broadcasts be preserved into the national archives of the Library of Congress TV & Film division. His establishment of a \\"Systematic Theology Project\\" was eventually jettisoned by his father, but a form of it was later adopted by a separate church that Armstrong would establish. =Relationship with Stanley R. Rader= By the mid-1970s, Stanley Rader, an attorney and church accountant who had been a personal assistant to Herbert W. Armstrong since 1958, appeared to be stepping into the number two position of administration previously thought to be Armstrong's domain. Relations between the two became strained and a power struggle ensued.John Trechak, \\"Power Struggle\\", Ambassador Report, Issue 5, April 1978. One conflict was that Rader had set up privately owned, affiliated corporations that were doing business with the church. Armstrong, and others in the organization, were skeptical of Rader's legal and financial dealings and suspected a bid to control the church's multimillion-dollar business. One objection to Rader's role was that, being Jewish, he had never been a baptized member of the church or a practicing Christian. That obstacle was removed in 1975 when Rader was baptized by the elder Armstrong. By the mid-1970s two different and rival views were developing regarding the work and future of the church. One plan was formulated by Armstrong, who wanted to take the church in a direction built around a larger publishing and broadcasting platform that would go out under his name. Armstrong was wary of prophecies built around specific dates, and he was reported to be against the idea of continuing to deliver messages that associated the U.S. and Britain with the Lost Ten Tribes. He experimented with turning the church's flagship magazine, The Plain Truth, into a tabloid-size newspaper in the style of the Christian Science Monitor. He envisioned a television broadcast along the lines of one that was later developed by the Christian Science Church, which created a short-lived nightly news program that was later seen on the Discovery Channel. Meanwhile, Stanley Rader aided significantly in crafting a unique role for the senior Armstrong on the world stage: Herbert W. Armstrong was promoted to various governments as an \\"ambassador without portfolio for world peace.\\" In that role he did not so much represent the Worldwide Church of God or Ambassador College as he did a completely new entity called the Ambassador International Cultural Foundation (AICF). This foundation helped to finance the Tatum O'Neal motion picture Paper Moon and a new and slick commercial publication called Quest; bought Everest House, a publishing company; and turned the Ambassador Auditorium, located on the college campus in Pasadena, into a performing arts venue that boasted an annual subscription series featuring world-renowned performers and celebrities from stage, screen and the recording arts. Gifts from the foundation helped Rader secure the audiences with world leaders for the elder Armstrong, whose message was less an overt Christian one than a more general one about peace, brotherly love, giving instead of getting, and a \\"great unseen hand from someplace\\" intervening in world affairs. Armstrong was known to disagree with this approach as well as the expenditure of funds on it and other foundation activities. It became an increasing point of division between father and son. In 1977, he officiated at the wedding of his father to the former Ramona Martin. The two separated in 1982 and divorced in 1984. =Father and son part ways= As Rader's influence with the elder Armstrong grew, so did the gap between Armstrong and his father over operations and certain doctrinal positions of the church. In 1978 Herbert Armstrong excommunicated his son and fired him from all roles in the church and college on the night of Wednesday, June 28, 1978, by means of a phone call to Tyler, Texas. Armstrong moved to Tyler, Texas, where he founded the Church of God International and the Armstrong Evangelistic Association, through which he soon returned to the television airwaves. Armstrong never again had the media outreach that he had enjoyed in his father's organization, nor did his new church ever rival his father's in membership statistics. The Church of God, International did, however, become a haven for some former members of the Pasadena church who took exception to Rader's role and/or the elder Armstrong's autocratic style. As a result, members of the Worldwide Church of God were forbidden by Herbert Armstrong from having any contact with Armstrong, and his name was removed from a significant number of church publications. At the time of the separation, he was one of the Evangelists of the Worldwide Church of God. However, in his later years, Armstrong's relationship with the Worldwide Church of God was somewhat cordial. Armstrong and his family were invited to stay on the Ambassador campus in Pasadena during the time of his father's funeral. He returned to the Big Sandy campus in 1986 for the funeral of Norval Pyle, an early Worldwide Church of God pioneer. In the spring of 1997, he was interviewed by a staff writer from the Ambassador University student newspaper (shortly before the university closed). Finally, the church archivist sent him several family heirlooms that were held in the Worldwide Church of God's possession following his father's death. Later ministry He continued his ministry through the Church of God, International (CGI) in the years that followed. Meanwhile, he appeared on both the John Ankerberg Show and The Oprah Winfrey Show. He continued to conduct personal appearance campaigns throughout the United States, Australia, Jamaica, and Canada but on a much smaller scale than during his heyday in the 1970s. The appearances also provided opportunities for unofficial reunions for those who left or remained in the Worldwide Church of God. In the fall of 1989, he travelled to Berlin to do on-the-spot radio broadcasts covering the fall of the Berlin Wall. In 1997, following accusations by a masseuse named Sue Rae Robertson, Armstrong was asked to resign as leader of the CGI, and remain a laymember, by the church's board of directors. No charges were ever filed in relation to the alleged assault, and civil cases brought against Armstrong and the CGI were dismissed. Instead, Armstrong chose to resign from CGI altogether, and founded the Intercontinental Church of God. Until his death, he was the head of his Armstrong Evangelistic Association, which he had established in 1978, and the Intercontinental Church of God. Death and legacy Armstrong died on September 15, 2003, due to complications from pneumonia.New York Times: Garner Ted Armstrong, Evangelist, Dies at 73. September 17, 2003. He was buried in Gladewater Memorial Park, approximately two miles east of the former Big Sandy, Texas, campus of Ambassador University. He is buried with his wife's family: his father-in-law Roy Hammer, his mother-in-law Pearl Hammer, and several other members of the Hammer family. His parents, paternal grandmother, and brother are buried in Altadena, California. The Hammers were the donors of the original property on which the Ambassador campus was located. His widow, Shirley, died in 2014. Rather than selecting a new media spokesman, the evangelistic association continues to broadcast old programs made by Armstrong on approximately 30 television stations and cable outlets according to the Armstrong TV/Radio Page of the ministry's website. The Intercontinental Church of God (United States) and Garner Ted Armstrong Evangelistic Association are now led by Mark Armstrong, who functions as CEO of the organizations and producer of the television outreach program.

Arrest Junius had first entered local politics in 1608 and had held the title of burgomaster in the years 1614, 1617, and 1621, and from the years 1624 to 1628. The Bamberg witch trials, which lasted from 1626 to 1631, were presided over by Prince-Bishop Johann Georg, who was dedicated to spreading the Counter-Reformation. There had been suspicion of Junius being due to his wife having been executed for witchcraft. Another b√ºrgermeister, Georg Neudecker had been accused of witchcraft and, following his imprisonment in April 1628, named Junius as an accomplice, leading to his arrest in June 1628. Junius was also implicated in the confessions of other suspected witches. Court documents describe how Junius at first denied all charges and demanded to confront his witnesses, and continued to deny his involvement in witchcraft after almost a week of torture, which included the application of thumbscrews, leg vises (Beinschrauben), and strappado. He finally confessed on July 5, 1628, in which he claimed that he had renounced God for the Devil and that he had seen twenty-seven of his colleagues at a sabbat. Junius was publicly burned to death one month later. Confession In his confession, Junius relates that in 1624, while in a difficult financial state, he was seduced by a woman who later proved to be a succubus and threatened to kill him unless he renounced God. At first Junius refused, but soon more demons materialised and attacked him further, finally convincing him to accept the Devil as his God. He took the witch-name of Krix and was provided with a familiar named F√ºchsin (\\"Vixen\\"), at which point several local townsfolk revealed themselves as similarly allied with Satan and congratulated him. Thereafter he regularly attended witch's sabbats, to which he rode on the back of a monstrous, flying black dog. At one such sabbat he attended a Black Mass at which Beelzebub made an appearance. Although his fellow witches and familiar demons had commanded him to kill his children in their name, he had been unable to perform this sacrifice, for which he was beaten. However, he did admit to having sacrificed his horse and burying a sacred wafer. Letter to daughter On July 24, shortly before his execution, Junius managed to write a letter to his daughter, Veronica, which was smuggled out of jail by his guard and successfully delivered. In the letter he defends his innocence, claims that those who testified against him have secretly begged his forgiveness, and recounts the abject horror of his torture (inflicted upon him by his brother- in-law and three others), from which his hands still shake at the time of writing the letter. He also says that at first he attempted to create a confession in which he could not identify the other witches, but was forced to name names under threat of further torture. The letter begins: \\"Many hundred thousand good-nights, dearly beloved daughter Veronica,\\" and ends \\"Good night, for your father Johannes Junius will see you no more.\\" =Full contents of letter= Many hundred thousand good-nights, dearly beloved daughter Veronica. Innocent have I come into prison, innocent have I been tortured, innocent must I die. For whoever comes into the witch prison must become a witch or be tortured until he invents something out of his head and - God pity him- bethinks him of something. I will tell you how it has gone with me. When I was the first time put to the torture, Dr. Braun, Dr. Kotzendorffer, and two strange doctors were there. Then Dr. Braun, asks me, \\"Kinsman, how come you here?\\", I answer, \\"Through falsehood, through misfortune.\\" \\"Hear, you,\\" he says, \\"you are a witch; will you confess it voluntarily? If not, we'll bring in witnesses and the executioner for you.\\" I said \\"I am no witch, I have a pure conscience in the matter; if there are a thousand witnesses, I am not anxious, but I'll gladly hear the witnesses.\\" Now the chancellor's son was set before me ... and afterward Hoppfen Elss. She had seen me dance on Haupts-moor ... I answered: \\"I have never renounced God, and will never do it- God graciously keep me from it. I'll rather bear whatever I must.\\" And then came also- God in highest Heaven have mercy- the executioner, and put the thumb- screws on me, both hands bound together, so that the blood ran out at the nails and everywhere, so that for four weeks I could not use my hands, as you can see from the writing ... Thereafter they first stripped me, bound my hands behind me, and drew me up in the torture. Then I thought heaven and earth were at an end; eight times did they draw me up and let me fall again, so that I suffered terrible agony .... And this happened on Friday, June 30, and with God's help I had to bear the torture. When at last the executioner led me back into the prison, he said to me: \\"Sir, I beg you, for God's sake confess something, for you cannot endure the torture which you will be put to; and even if you bear it all, yet you will not escape, not even if you were an earl, but one torture will follow after another until you say you are a witch. Not before that,\\" he said, \\"will they let you go, as you may see by all their trials, for one is just like another.\\"... And so I begged, since I was in a wretched plight, to be given one day for thought and a priest. The priest was refused me, but the time for thought was given. Now, my dear child, see what hazard I stood and still stand. I must say that I am a witch, though I am not, - must now renounce God, though I have never done it before Day and night I was deeply troubled, but a last there came to me a new idea. I would not be anxious, but, since I had been given no priest with whom I could take counsel, I would myself think of something and say it. It were surely better that I just say it with mouth and words, even though I had not really done it'; and afterwards I would confess it to the priest, and let those answer for it who compel me to do it. ... And so I made my confession, as follows; but it was all a lie. Now follows, dear child, what I confessed in order to escape the great anguish and bitter torture, which it was impossible for me longer to bear. .... Then I had to tell what people I had seen [at the witch-sabbath]. I said that I had not recognized them. \\"You old rascal, I must set the executioner at you. Say- was not the Chancellor there?\\" So I said yes. \\"Who besides?\\" I had not recognized anybody. So he said: \\"Take one street after another; begin at the market, go out on one street and back on the next.\\" I had to name several persons there. Then came the long street. I knew nobody. Had to name eight persons there. Then the Zinkenwert- one person more. Then over the upper bridge to the Georgthor, on both sides. Knew nobody again. Did I know nobody in the castle- whoever it might be, I should speak without fear. And thus continuously they asked me on all the streets, though I could not and would not say more. So they gave me to the executioner, told him to strip me, shave me all over, and put me to the torture. \\"The rascal knows one on the market-place, is with him daily, and yet won't know him.\\" By that they meant Dietmery: so I had to name him too. Then I had to tell what crimes I had committed. I said nothing. ...\\"Draw the rascal up!\\" So I said that I was to kill my children, but I had killed a horse instead. It did not help. I had also taken a sacred wafer, and had desecrated it. When I had said this, they left me in peace. Now dear child, here you have all my confession, for which I must die. And they are sheer lies and made-up things, so help me God. For all this I was forced to say through fear of the torture which was threatened beyond what I had already endured. For they never leave off with the torture till one confesses something; be he never so good, he must be a witch. Nobody escapes, though he were an earl. ... Dear child, keep this letter secret so that people do not find it, else I shall be tortured most piteously and the jailers will be beheaded. So strictly is it forbidden. ...Dear child, pay this man a dollar... I have taken several days to write this: my hands are both lame. I am in a sad plight....

A major founding organizers of the Agricultural Wheel was W.W. Tedford an Arkansas farmer and school teacher. Like similar farm protest organizations such as the Southern Farmers' Alliance, the Louisiana Farmers' Union. and the Brothers of Freedom, the Agricultural Wheel had been formed to expose and correct the injustices and oppressions done to the small farmers by merchants, grain elevators and the railroads. The Wheel promoted a radical agenda including currency expansion through free silver; closing all national banks; regulation or nationalization of the railroads, the telephones and the telegraph; allow only Americans to purchase public lands; impose an income tax on high incomes; and elect senators by popular election instead of by state legislatures. The Wheel encouraged farmers to join local cooperatives, avoid the debt cycle, and avoid one crop overemphasis on cotton.Schwartz, pp. 12 and 253. Historian Theodore Saloutos says that: : the Agricultural Wheel was a protest against the effects of the Civil War and Reconstruction, the difficulties of a pioneer, primitive, sparsely-settled community attempting to adapt itself to a small-scale commercialized state of agriculture, the effects of one-crop farming, the share and crop-lean systems, lawlessness, and corruption in \\"high places.\\"Theodore Saloutos, \\"The Agricultural Wheel in Arkansas.\\" Arkansas Historical Quarterly 2.2 (1943) p 12. History On February 15, 1882, during a period of depressed farm prices and drought, a group of nine Arkansas farmers led by W. W. Tedford, W. A. Suit and W. Taylor McBee met at the McBee Schoolhouse eight miles south of Des Arc in Prairie County in eastern Arkansas and formed the Wattensas Farmers' Club. The club vowed to improve the lives of farmers, improve their education and knowledge, and improve communications between them. Many Arkansas farmers were suffering under what they viewed as oppressive mortgages (known as anaconda mortgages) and were heavily in debt. Within a short time it was suggested that the organization change its name. The choices were between \\"The Poor Man's Friend\\" and \\"The Agricultural Wheel\\" which was the name finally selected. The situation did not improve in Arkansas that year and farmers were in such desperate straits that they called upon Governor Churchill to ask the legislature to postpone the collection of taxes. By 1883 the organization consisted of over 500 members in Arkansas. At the organization's meeting in the spring a state Wheel was established and deputies were appointed to spread the word to neighboring states and seek to establish local wheels in those states. In October 1885 the Wheel absorbed, by a vote of both organizations, the Brothers of Freedom, another Arkansas farm organization. In July 1886, the merger of the two farm organizations became official.Schwaertz, Michael, Radical Protest and Social Structure: The Southern Farmers' Alliance and Cotton Tenancy, 1880-1890, p. 93. In 1886 delegates from Arkansas, Kentucky and Tennessee gathered at the town of Litchfield, Arkansas, to establish the National Agricultural Wheel and an official newspaper for the organization. By the time of the 1887 meeting, the membership of the national organization was over 500,000 farmers from Arkansas, Tennessee, Kentucky, Mississippi, Missouri, Indian Territory, and Wisconsin. The growing political clout of the organization led it to promulgate a platform consisting of the following demands:Theodore Saloutos, \\"The Agricultural Wheel in Arkansas.\\" * Paying off the national debt * Repeal of laws that favored capital over labor * Preventing aliens from owning land * Abolishing national banks * Government operations on a cash basis * Ending of agricultural futures trading * Establishing a graduated income tax * Prohibiting importation of foreign labor * National ownership of transportation and communication * Direct election of national politicians * Free trade and removal of all import duties * Establishment of a luxury tax * Free public education * No renewal of patents In 1888 at the national meeting in Meridian, Mississippi a merger between the Wheel and the Farmers' Alliance was proposed. The two organizations met jointly in 1889 in Birmingham, Alabama and merged that same year. Among farmers' organizations of the period the Wheel was remarkable for refusal to hold racially segregated meetings, a policy it held until merger with the Farmers' Alliance. Merger Centered largely in the state of Arkansas the Agricultural Wheel sought association with other farm protest organizations outside the state. Merger talks had begun as early as 1887 between these protest groups. Besides the similarity of their political goals the Agricultural Wheel and the other farm protest organization shared the same organizational structure.Schwartz, p. 100. The Agricultural Wheel and the other farm protest organizations anticipating merger were organized on the basis of small clubs of farmers organized at the neighborhood level. Even organization at the county level had proved to be impractical. County level organization was too large and not \\"local enough.\\" In the 1880s, small farmers rarely journeyed to the county seat of their home counties. The Agricultural Wheel continued to exist as a separate organization until 1889 when it merged with the National Farmers' Alliance to form the Farmers' and Laborers' Union of America.

He was credited by many with the Chechen victory in the First Chechen War, which allowed for the establishment of the de facto independent Chechen Republic of Ichkeria. Maskhadov was elected President of Chechnya in January 1997. Following the start of the Second Chechen War in August 1999, he returned to leading the guerrilla resistance against the Russian army. De facto Ichkeria ceased to exist at the beginning of 2000. Until his death, Maskhadov was President in exile.

His family was of the Alaroy teip. In 1957, his family returned to Chechnya where they settled in Zebir- Yurt, Nadterechny District. Maskhadov joined the Soviet Army, trained in the neighbouring Georgian SSR and graduated from the Tbilisi Artillery School in 1972. He then graduated with honours from the Leningrad Kalinin Higher Artillery in 1981.Maskhadov, Aslan (Khalid) Alievich He was posted to Hungary with a self-propelled artillery regiment until 1986 and then from 1986 in the Baltic Military District. He served from 1990 as the chief of staff of Soviet missile and artillery forces in Vilnius, capital of the Lithuanian SSR. In January 1991, Maskhadov participated in the January Events, the seizure of the television tower by Soviet troops (which he regretted later), but didn't participate in the assault itself. During his service in the Soviet Army, he was presented with two Orders For Service to Homeland. Maskhadov retired from the Soviet Army in 1992 with the rank of a colonel and returned to his native land. He was at the head of ChRI civil defence from late 1992 to November 1993. After the dissolution of the Soviet Union, in the summer of 1993, Maskhadov took part in raids on the armed opposition against the government of Dzhokhar Dudayev in the Urus-Martan, Nadterechny, and Gudermes districts. An unsuccessful anti-Dudayev mutiny in November 1993 resulted in the dismissal of Viskhan Shakhabov as chief of staff of the Chechen armed forces, Maskhadov was appointed as the acting chief of staff and, in March 1994, as the chief of staff. =First Chechen War= In December 1994, when the First Chechen War broke out, he was the senior military figure on the Chechen side during the war and was widely seen as being instrumental to the Chechen victory over the Russian forces. As the First Deputy Chairman of the ChRI State Defence Council (ChRI President Dudayev was the chairman) and the chief of staff, Maskhadov organised defence of the Chechen capital during the Battle of Grozny. Maskhadov commanded the city from the Presidential Palace in Grozny, where on one occasion a Russian bunker buster bomb landed 20 meters from him but failed to explode. In February 1995, Dudayev promoted Aslan to Divisional General. Beginning in June 1995, Maskhadov took part in peace talks in Grozny to resolve the crisis in Chechnya. In June 1996, at the negotiations in Nazran, Ingushetia, Maskhadov, on behalf of the ChRI administration, signed the Protocol of the Commission's Meeting on Ceasefire and Measures to Resolve the Armed Conflict in the CRI. In August 1996, after Grozny's seizure by Chechen units he repeatedly held talks with Alexander Lebed and on 31 August 1996, the signing of the Khasav-Yurt Accord took place, a ceasefire agreement, and peace treaty which marked the end of the First Chechen War. =President of the Chechen Republic of Ichkeria= Aslan Maskhadov and Boris Yeltsin shake hands after signing the Moscow peace treaty On 17 October 1996, Maskhadov was appointed Prime Minister of Ichkeria, while he also remained Chief of Staff and Defence Minister. Maskhadov nominated himself for President of Ichkeria on 3 December 1996, for the January 1997 free democratic presidential and parliamentary elections held in Chechnya under the aegis of the OSCE, running primarily against Shamil Basayev and Zelimkhan Yandarbiyev. The elections were conducted on the basis of the Chechen constitution adopted in March 1992, according to which the Chechen Republic was an independent state. Representatives of more than 20 countries, as well as the United Nations and the OSCE, attended the elections as observers. Running with Vakha Arsanov, who became his vice president, Mashkadov won a majority of 60% of the votes and was congratulated by the Russian President Boris Yeltsin, who pledged to work towards rebuilding relations with Chechnya. Maskhadov was inaugurated on 12 February 1997, and at the same time he assumed the office of prime minister and abolished the office of Defence Minister he had occupied since late 1996. Maskhadov remained commander-in-chief of the republican armed forces. On 12 May 1997, Maskhadov then attained the apex of his political career when he signed a peace treaty with Yeltsin at the Kremlin. By the end of 1996, when Maskhadov assumed his office, nearly half a million people (40% of Chechya prewar population) had been internally displaced and lived in refugee camps or overcrowded villages. Alex Goldfarb and Marina Litvinenko. \\"Death of a Dissident: The Poisoning of Alexander Litvinenko and the Return of the KGB.\\" Free Press, New York, 2007. . The economy was destroyed and the warlords had no intention to disband their militias. Under such circumstances, Maskhadov's political fortunes began to wane. His political standing within Chechnya became increasingly insecure as he lost control to Basayev and other warlords. Even his Vice-President Arsanov became his political enemy. Just like in the years before the First Chechen War under Dudayev, the years of Chechen independence were notorious for organized crime, including kidnapping, leading to several public executions of criminals.\\"Latvia Condemns Public Executions in Chechnya\\" (23 September 1997) Maskhadov attempted with only limited success to curb the growth of Wahhabism and other fundamentalist Muslim groups supported by Basayev, producing a split in the Chechen separatist movement between Islamic fundamentalism and secular Chechen nationalists. In February 1999, as a concession to radical Islamists, Maskhadov introduced Islamic Sharia law. The Sharia courts that were established sentenced people to death, flogging, executing people for crimes such as adultery. Maskhadov survived assassination attempts on his life three times, on 23 July 1998 and 21 March and 10 April in 1999, in which the attackers used anti-tank missiles and bombs. Russian secret services were officially blamed. =Second Chechen War= In the summer of 1999, Maskhadov condemned an attempt by Basayev and Ibn Al-Khattab to spread war to the neighboring republic of Dagestan (known as the Invasion of Dagestan). This raid, and the Russian Apartment Bombings, were both blamed on the Chechen Republic of Ichkeria. On 1 October 1999, the then Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin declared the authority of President Maskhadov and his parliament illegitimate. Putin sent Russian forces into Chechnya, and his promise of a quick and decisive victory propelled him to the Russian Presidency.–ü—Ä–æ—Ñ–∏–ª—å ‚Äî –µ–∂–µ–Ω–µ–¥–µ–ª—å–Ω—ã–π –¥–µ–ª–æ–≤–æ–π –∂—É—Ä–Ω–∞–ª On 11 October 1999, Maskhadov outlined a peace plan offering a crackdown on renegade warlords, the offer was rejected by the Russian side. In response, President Maskhadov declared a gazavat (holy war) to confront the approaching Russian army. Soon, martial law was declared in Ichkeria and reservists were called, and the building of his Presidential Palace was one of the supposed targets of the disastrous Grozny ballistic missile attack on 23 October 1999. Maskhadov was one of the main commanders in the Battle of Grozny (1999‚Äì2000) along with Shamil Basayev, Ruslan Gelayev, Ibn Al-Khattab, Aslambek Ismailov and Khunkarpasha Israpilov. Maskhadov along with his men launched daring counter- attacks against the Russian troops while fighting in Grozny and also effectively used the sewer systems to attack Russian troops from behind. After a meeting with top rebel commanders, Maskhadov and others agreed to withdraw from Grozny and continue to attack Russian forces in the cities and towns surrounding the city. Maskhadov was the first to withdraw because of his importance to the rebel cause and because he was the official President of Chechnya. As Maskhadov and his men retreated, they set up a vast amount of booby traps and landmines to hinder Russian forces and make most of Grozny impassable.:–ö—É–ª—å—Ç—É—Ä–∞ –ß–µ—á–Ω–∏: –∏—Å—Ç–æ—Ä–∏—è –∏ —Å–æ–≤—Ä–µ–º–µ–Ω–Ω—ã–µ –ø—Ä–æ–±–ª–µ–º—ã / –û—Ç–≤. —Ä–µ–¥. –•. –í. –¢—É—Ä–∫–∞–µ–≤; –ò–Ω-—Ç —ç—Ç–Ω–æ–ª–æ–≥–∏–∏ –∏ –∞–Ω—Ç—Ä–æ–ø–æ–ª–æ–≥–∏–∏. ‚Äî –ú.: –ù–∞—É–∫–∞, 2002. ‚Äî 382 —Å. ‚Äî After Chechen forces' withdrawal from Grozny following another battle for the city, Maskhadov returned to a life of a guerrilla leader, living in hiding as Russia's second most wanted man after Basayev, with Russia placing a $10 million bounty on his capture. He was seen as the official political leader of the separatist forces during the war, but it is unclear what kind of a military role he played. Maskhadov offered his readiness for unconditional peace talks with Moscow several times in 2000 alone, continuing in the following years, but his appeals for a political solution were always ignored by the Russian side. Maskhadov advocated armed resistance to what he saw as a Russian occupation of Chechnya but condemned attacks on civilians. He allegedly supported the assassination of pro-Russian Chechen President Akhmad Kadyrov in Chechnya, whilst condemning the Russian assassination of Chechen separatist ex-President Yandarbiyev in Qatar in 2004. Maskhadov often denied responsibility for the increasingly brutal terrorist acts against Russian civilians by Basayev's followers, continually issuing denunciations of such incidents through spokesmen abroad, such as Akhmed Zakayev in London. However, on 24 October 2002, radio communications were intercepted from Maskhadov's messages wherein he called for intensification of terrorist activities and sabotage in Russian territory. Evidence for Maskhadov's complicity in the 2002 Moscow theater hostage crisis was provided by its two principal perpetrators, Movsar Barayev and Abu Said. Although he initially denied responsibility for the 2004 Nazran raid, in which 98 police officers/troops were killed, in July 2004 Maskhadov publicly accepted responsibility for the attacks. In the same month, Maskahdov promised similar attacks would happen, and vowed that the winner of Chechnya's upcoming presidential election would be illegitimate and would be attacked if necessary. He described the rebels behind the Beslan school siege as \\"madmen\\" driven out of their senses by Russian acts of brutality and called the terrorist attack an atrocity. On 15 January 2005, Maskhadov issued a special order to stop all military operations except those in self-defense, both inside and outside Chechnya, until the end of February (the date marking the anniversary of the Stalin's Vainakh deportations of 1944) as a gesture of good will, and again called for a negotiated end to the Chechen conflict. Umar Khambiev, his designated negotiator, said that the separatists were no longer seeking independence, but only \\"guarantees for the existence of the Chechen nation\\". This surprise, unilateral ceasefire was supported by Basayev but flatly rejected by the Russian and pro-Russian leaders who, once again, refused to negotiate. Maskhadov's order to temporarily cease all offensive actions was largely followed by the rebel movement, except in Dagestan. =Death= On 8 March 2005, less than a month after Maskhadov announced the cease-fire, the head of the Federal Security Service of the Russian Federation (FSB) Nikolay Patrushev announced that special forces attached to the FSB had \\"today carried out an operation in the settlement of Tolstoy-Yurt, as a result of which the international jihadist and leader of armed groups Maskhadov was killed, and his closest comrades-in- arms detained\\". He said the special operations unit had wanted to take Maskhadov alive for interrogation, but claim that they killed him accidentally with a grenade thrown into a bunker where Maskhadov was hiding. Akhmed Zakayev, one of his closest allies who acted as his spokesman and foreign minister, told a Russian radio station that it was probable that Maskhadov had indeed been killed; he indicated later that a new Chechen leader could be chosen within days. Vladimir Putin awarded those responsible for the killings with medals. Shortly after Maskhadov's death, the Chechen rebel council announced that Abdul-Halim Sadulayev had assumed the leadership.–ê–Ω–¥—Ä–µ–π –°–∞–≤–µ–ª—å–µ–≤: –ß—ë—Ä–Ω–∞—è –∫–Ω–∏–≥–∞ —á–µ—á–µ–Ω—Å–∫–æ–π –≤–æ–π–Ω—ã Four Chechens, Vakhit Murdashev, Viskhan Hadzhimuradov, Skanarbek Yusupov and Ilias Iriskhanov, were captured by the special operation. According to the ballistic evidence at their trial in the Supreme Court of the Chechen Republic, Maskhadov was killed by a shot from the pistol of Viskhan Hadzhimuradov, his nephew and bodyguard. Hadzhimuradov testified that he does not remember whether he shot Maskhadov or not since he was stunned by an explosion but after the capture Hadzhimuradov reportedly said: \\"My uncle always told me to shoot him if he is wounded and his capture is imminent. He said that if he is taken prisoner, he would be mistreated like Saddam Hussein had been\\".¬´–°–ª–µ–¥—Å—Ç–≤–∏–µ: –ú–∞—Å—Ö–∞–¥–æ–≤–∞ –∑–∞—Å—Ç—Ä–µ–ª–∏–ª –æ—Ö—Ä–∞–Ω–Ω–∏–∫.¬ª Unmarked grave On 24 April 2006, the General Procurator's Office of Russia officially refused to turn the remains of Aslan Maskhadov over to his relatives for burial. The refusal was described as legal: > Maskhadov A.

Petrology has three subdivisions: igneous, metamorphic, and sedimentary petrology. Igneous and metamorphic petrology are commonly taught together because they both contain heavy use of chemistry, chemical methods, and phase diagrams. Sedimentary petrology is, on the other hand, commonly taught together with stratigraphy because it deals with the processes that form sedimentary rock.  Background  Lithology was once approximately synonymous with petrography, but in current usage, lithology focuses on macroscopic hand-sample or outcrop-scale description of rocks while petrography is the speciality that deals with microscopic details. In the petroleum industry, lithology, or more specifically mud logging, is the graphic representation of geological formations being drilled through, and drawn on a log called a mud log. As the cuttings are circulated out of the borehole they are sampled, examined (typically under a 10√ó microscope) and tested chemically when needed. Methodology Ljudmila Dolar Mantuani (1906-1988) first female professor of petrography in Yugoslavia. Petrology utilizes the fields of mineralogy, petrography, optical mineralogy, and chemical analysis to describe the composition and texture of rocks. Petrologists also include the principles of geochemistry and geophysics through the study of geochemical trends and cycles and the use of thermodynamic data and experiments in order to better understand the origins of rocks.  Branches  There are three branches of petrology, corresponding to the three types of rocks: igneous, metamorphic, and sedimentary, and another dealing with experimental techniques: *Igneous petrology focuses on the composition and texture of igneous rocks (rocks such as granite or basalt which have crystallized from molten rock or magma). Igneous rocks include volcanic and plutonic rocks. *Sedimentary petrology focuses on the composition and texture of sedimentary rocks (rocks such as sandstone, shale, or limestone which consist of pieces or particles derived from other rocks or biological or chemical deposits, and are usually bound together in a matrix of finer material). *Metamorphic petrology focuses on the composition and texture of metamorphic rocks (rocks such as slate, marble, gneiss, or schist which started out as sedimentary or igneous rocks but which have undergone chemical, mineralogical or textural changes due to extremes of pressure, temperature or both) *Experimental petrology employs high-pressure, high-temperature apparatus to investigate the geochemistry and phase relations of natural or synthetic materials at elevated pressures and temperatures. Experiments are particularly useful for investigating rocks of the lower crust and upper mantle that rarely survive the journey to the surface in pristine condition. They are also one of the prime sources of information about completely inaccessible rocks such as those in the Earth's lower mantle and in the mantles of the other terrestrial planets and the Moon. The work of experimental petrologists has laid a foundation on which modern understanding of igneous and metamorphic processes has been built.

Ochnaceae to Loasaceae. 3: 9‚Äì751. In R. McVaugh (ed.) Flora Novo-Galiciana. The University of Michigan, Ann Arbor While semi- succulent and a desert plant, Ocotillo is more closely related to tea and blueberries than to cactuses. For much of the year, the plant appears to be an arrangement of large spiny dead sticks, although closer examination reveals that the stems are partly green. With rainfall, the plant quickly becomes lush with small (2‚Äì4 cm), ovate leaves, which may remain for weeks or even months. Individual stems may reach a diameter of 5 cm at the base, and the plant may grow to a height of 10 m (33 ft). The plant branches very heavily at its base, but above that, the branches are pole-like and rarely divide further. Specimens in cultivation may not exhibit any secondary branches. The leaf stalks harden into blunt spines, and new leaves sprout from the base of the spine. The bright crimson flowers appear especially after rainfall in spring, summer, and occasionally fall. Flowers are clustered indeterminately at the tips of each mature stem. Individual flowers are mildly zygomorphic and are pollinated by hummingbirds and native carpenter bees. Cultivation An ocotillo in spring bloom on Pinyon Wash Road in Anza-Borrego Desert State Park, California Ocotillo can be planted year-round with care. Ideal plants have been grown in pots from stem cuttings and from seed. Transplanting large bare-root plants has marginal success. They should be planted to the original growing depth and, as with cacti, in their original directional orientation: the original south side of the plant, which has become more heat- and sunlight-resistant, should again face the brighter, hotter southern direction. If their direction is not marked, success is again limited. Ocotillo plants prefer well-drained, sandy or gravely loam soil with low to moderate amounts of organic content. Ideal locations are sunny, open, unrestricted and those where surface water does not collect. Transplanted plants require irrigation to become established, but once established, they can survive on 8 inches of rainfall per year. Uses * Individual ocotillo stems are sometimes used as poles as a fencing material in their native region, and often take root to form a living fence. * Due to their light weight and interesting pattern, ocotillo branches have been used for canes or walking sticks. * Fresh flowers are sometimes used in salads and have a tangy flavor. * Flowers are collected, dried, and used for tisanes. * According to Medicinal Plants of the Desert and Canyon West (a book published in 1989 by Museum of New Mexico Press), a fresh bark tincture can be made by chopping or snipping freshly removed bark into 1/2-inch pieces. It is said to be useful for those symptoms that arise due to fluid congestion and to be absorbed from the intestines into the mesenteric lymph system by way of the lacteals of the small intestinal lining. This is believed to stimulate better visceral lymph drainage into the thoracic duct and improve dietary fat absorption into the lymph system.Maya Strunk (Spring 2001 Independent study) at Medicinal Plants of the Southwest * Bathing in water that contains crushed flowers or roots has been used to relieve fatigue. * Native Americans place the flowers and roots of ocotillo over fresh wounds to slow bleeding. * Ocotillo is also used to alleviate coughing, achy limbs, varicose veins, urinary tract infections, cervical varicosities, and benign prostate growths.

Several of the men, most notably Michaels, Nash, and Hall, wielded an immense amount of power within the company at the time, which they used to positively influence one another's careers and occasionally negatively influence the careers of others. In May 1996, The Kliq broke character at a live event at Madison Square Garden in an unscripted incident referred to as the \\"Curtain Call\\", which had far-reaching ramifications for the WWE specifically and the wrestling world as a whole. At a time when professional wrestling organizations worked to maintain the illusion of storylines and characters, the Curtain Call marked the first time that such high-profile performers had so publicly broken character, forcing the WWE and other wrestling organizations to begin acknowledging the scripted elements of their programming. The Kliq was also the primary catalyst for two of the most well known stables in wrestling history: the New World Order (nWo) in World Championship Wrestling (WCW) and the WWF/E, and D-Generation X (D-X) in the WWF/E. During the Monday Night Wars, Waltman would be the only Kliq member to serve in both groups; Michaels and Triple H were members of D-X while Nash and Hall performed with the nWo. Michaels was briefly a member of the nWo during a later revival of that group in WWE.  History  = Formation and early history = The Kliq was formed in 1994 by real-life friends Scott Hall (then known as Razor Ramon), Kevin Nash (Diesel), Michael Hickenbottom (Shawn Michaels) and Sean Waltman (1-2-3 Kid). In January 1995, Paul Levesque left WCW and arrived in the WWF as Hunter Hearst Helmsley (Triple H) and became the next member of The Kliq. Each man enjoyed a tremendous amount of popularity with fans, which allotted them a particular degree of control over their own careers. Nash, Hall, and Michaels, then among the company's most popular performers, came up with the idea of forming a backstage alliance, which would potentially allow them to consolidate even more power within the company. Bret Hart, another of the company's top performers at the time, claims in his autobiography Hitman that he was also asked if he wanted to be part of The Kliq, but declined the offer: \\"The thing I remember most about that tour was Shawn, Razor, and Nash talking to me in Hamburg about the idea of forming a clique of top guys who strictly took care of their own\\". Levesque mentioned on the 2013 Triple H ‚Äì Thy Kingdom Come DVD that he was recruited to the Kliq by Kevin Nash because he didn't do drugs or alcohol, and thus could serve as the group's designated driver after events. Michaels claims that the name \\"The Kliq\\" was originally coined by Lex Luger, due to the closeness of the five friends backstage. Although, Lex Luger had suggested that Davey Boy Smith created the name, because the five kept \\"clicking\\", referring to how often they talked. At the suggestion of Vince Russo, Michaels began referring to his fans as his \\"Kliq\\". Michaels wrote in his 2006 autobiography that he disliked the idea, and that it \\"was not a huge hit\\" with the fans. In 1995, the men's growing popularity as performers led to the group developing a heavy influence on booking‚Äì the power to schedule matches and decide match outcomes, write storylines, and largely determine the trajectory of other performers' careers. The group used this power to give one another preferential treatment, usually scheduling each other in heavily promoted, high-profile matches, often against one another: During the period of 1994 through 1996 particularly, Ramon had high-profile feuds with 1-2-3 Kid, Diesel, and Michaels, while Diesel and Michaels formed a championship-winning tag-team called Two Dudes with Attitudes. The group's perceived abuse of power led to animosity amongst other wrestlers, particularly lower-ranking members of the company. In one instance, performer Carl Ouellet, then performing as Jean-Pierre Lafitte, claimed that his scheduled defeat of Diesel was vetoed by Michaels, leading to a backstage confrontation between Ouellet and Michaels. The match between the two ended in a double-countout because Lafitte refused to be pinned by Nash. In retaliation, the group effectively ended Ouellet's career with the company by scheduling him to repeatedly lose low-profile matches. In his autobiography, Michaels said that \\"we (The Kliq) buried him (Ouellet).\\" Lafitte left the company soon after the incident; contrary to rumors, Michaels says that WWF Chairman Vince McMahon did not fire Lafitte. = The MSG \\"Curtain Call\\" = In April 1996, Nash and Hall signed contracts with WCW, the WWF's top competitor, with whom the company was embroiled in a bitter rivalry. Accounts have differed as to what led to the men's departure: Wrestling commentators have speculated that their contracts were allowed to expire in order to cripple The Kliq's influence in the company, while official WWE media asserts that Nash and Hall were simply offered more money by WCW than the WWF was able to promise them at the time.The Monday Night War. WWE Home Video. 2004. Nash and Hall's last contracted match for the WWF took place on May 19, 1996 at Madison Square Garden. At the time, Levesque and Nash were wrestling as villains, while Michaels and Hall were fan favorites. At the end of the night, Michaels wrestled Nash in a steel cage match. Immediately after the match, Hall entered the ring and hugged Michaels; this was not seen as unusual in-story, as both wrestlers were fan favorites. However, Levesque then entered the ring and hugged Hall, followed by Nash. The four wrestlers then group hugged for several seconds before they turned to face the crowd with their arms raised together. Waltman, who himself would leave for WCW shortly after the incident, was in drug rehab at the time and thus didn't participate.Monday Night War: WWE vs. WCW The Kliq Triple H was the sole member of The Kliq punished for the \\"Curtain Call\\" Their actions ‚Äì dubbed the \\"Curtain Call\\" ‚Äì scandalized WWF management. At the time, most major wrestling promotions, the WWF included, prided themselves on maintaining kayfabe ‚Äì the illusion that all of the events which transpired in-ring were real and unscripted, and that wrestlers' on- screen rivalries extended outside of the ring. The company had a strict policy of onscreen rivals not breaking character by associating with one another on WWF programming, as a means of maintaining storylines and feuds between wrestlers, which sometimes lasted for years and could unravel in seconds if the two feuding wrestlers were seen associating as friends in public. WWF Chairman Vince McMahon was reported to have initially given his tacit approval for a \\"farewell\\" ceremony, but did not realize that it would become so elaborate. The severity of the incident was further compounded by the revelation that the event‚Äîwhich was not broadcast on television‚Äîhad been filmed by two fans, Mani Mohtadi and Jason Cosmides, who had smuggled a camcorder past security. Stills from the footage were widely disseminated online and in wrestling magazines at the time, bringing the Curtain Call to a wider audience than if it had not been recorded. Because Hall and Nash had already confirmed their departure for WCW, they escaped punishment. Michaels, who was the WWF World Heavyweight Champion at the time and one of the promotion's biggest drawing performers, could not be punished. The punishment fell solely on Levesque, who was demoted from being a championship contender to wrestling inexperienced or lesser experienced wrestlers for the next several months. He did, however, win the WWF Intercontinental Championship five months later. Levesque's unquestioning acceptance of his punishment had the unintended side effect of rehabilitating his image in the eyes of other performers who held a grudge against him for his time with the Kliq: according to The Undertaker in HHH: The Game DVD that when Levesque first arrived in the WWF, he was perceived of as arrogant and self-centered, but that by accepting his punishment, he earned legitimate respect. The incident turned out to have a major impact on the WWF's future. For the first time in modern pro-wrestling history, a major company was forced to acknowledge that its events were scripted; McMahon would later use this to his advantage in the development of several meta-storylines, including a skit on the October 6, 1997 episode of Raw Is War in which Michaels and Levesque, both in character, played footage of the Curtain Call incident. Before the Curtain Call, Levesque had been booked into the finals of the 1996 King of the Ring tournament during the following summer, but his place ‚Äì and the push that usually went with it ‚Äì would instead go to Stone Cold Steve Austin, igniting his rise toward superstardom, an event which ultimately helped the WWF defeat WCW in the Monday Night Wars. Levesque's acceptance of his punishment and the respect it earned him resulted in him only suffering short-term repercussions. He would go on to win the following year's King of the Ring tournament and later went on to become a 14-time world champion, beginning with his WWF Championship victory over Mankind the night after SummerSlam in 1999. = The nWo and D-Generation X = When Hall and Nash went to WCW, they formed the tag team The Outsiders, as well as the New World Order (nWo) stable alongside Hulk Hogan. Rather than see the breaking of kayfabe as a crisis moment for professional wrestling, WCW decided to exploit it by introducing their own meta-storyline that incorporated fans' growing awareness of the backstage politics of pro-wrestling: Upon Nash and Hall's arrival, they were implied to still be working for the WWF, staging an \\"invasion\\" of WCW. When Waltman later jumped to WCW, he also joined the nWo as Syxx, often working closely with the Outsiders and forming the trio known as the Wolfpac. Many fans criticized Kevin Nash for his booking tenure in WCW since it displayed the same self- promoting behavior associated with The Kliq on an even larger scale. Fans often pointed to Nash booking himself to win the WCW World Heavyweight Championship from the then-undefeated Goldberg and the subsequent match with Hogan as the most grievous of his \\"offenses\\". Nash, however, claims that he did not have booking power at the time of the incident. Nash's innocence claim is disputed in several shoot interviews by various WCW wrestlers from the time who claimed that he, Hogan and several others often refused to put other wrestlers over in order to keep themselves as the main stars. Sean Waltman was a member of both the nWo and D-Generation X Meanwhile, Michaels and Levesque began to persuade WWF management to let them pair up on screen, but management was hesitant and wanted to keep them separated on-screen. They eventually aligned together in the faction D-Generation X (D-X), with Levesque's \\"Hunter Hearst Helmsley\\" fictional persona gradually transformed and re-dubbed Triple H or HHH, and alongside Levesque's then-girlfriend and on-screen female \\"bodyguard\\" Chyna. Rick Rude also temporarily joined the group (as a sort of on-screen bodyguard for Michaels), though his membership ended when he signed with WCW after his WWF contract expired in early November 1997. D-X eventually became as influential to the Monday Night Wars as the nWo. D-X's antics also went on to help spark The Attitude Era in the WWF. After Sean Waltman was fired from WCW, he was hired by WWF and joined D-X, replacing the injured Michaels. The nWo's hand sign, often referred to as the \\"Wolf Head\\", was originally used by the Kliq members in the WWF. Hall and Nash brought the hand sign with them and it became widely used by the nWo members and fans worldwide. On the October 6, 1997 Raw Is War, Shawn Michaels alluded to this off-screen connection. After Bret Hart claimed to have destroyed the Kliq and to have \\"run [Scott Hall and Kevin Nash] outta town\\", Michaels declared, \\"The Kliq owns this [professional wrestling] business\\", and said that it had really undergone \\"expansion\\" rather than \\"destruction\\". During a brief period in 1998, after Waltman's return to the WWF as X-Pac, in promos the members of D-Generation X made numerous references to their \\"friends\\" in WCW. On the April 27, 1998 Raw (recorded live in Hampton, Virginia), D-X (by now composed of Triple H, Waltman, Billy Gunn, Road Dogg and Chyna) staged a mock \\"invasion\\" protest/paramilitary take-over of the nearby Norfolk Scope, where Nitro was being held. Triple H, riding in an M38, chanted \\"Let our people go!\\" through a megaphone during the incident. Waltman called out, \\"We just wanted to say 'what's up' to our boys Kevin Nash and Scott Hall\\". D-X also led a chant of \\"WCW sucks\\" by fans outside the arena who had tickets to the show (some of whom, Triple H alleged, had been given free tickets to Nitro by WCW in order to boost crowd numbers, a common trick promoters have done to fill arenas and increase concession and merchandise sales). In 2002, after WCW had gone out of business, The nWo was reformed in the WWF with Hall, Nash and Hogan, the group's initial members. Hogan soon left the group after being attacked by Nash and Hall as a result of his turning into a fan favorite at WrestleMania X8. Other former members, including Big Show and Waltman, joined the group. Later, Shawn Michaels ‚Äì after years away from the ring ‚Äìwas introduced by Kevin Nash as the newest member of the nWo, and Michaels promised the rest of the group that he would soon deliver Triple H. After weeks of lobbying for Triple H's services, a backstage promo of The nWo wishing Triple H luck before the match aired. This included 4 members of The Kliq (Michaels, Nash, Waltman and Triple H), as Big Show appeared wishing Triple H good luck as well. The nWo told Triple H to \\"throw up the hand signal\\" if he needed any help out there. Shortly thereafter, Nash suffered a torn quadriceps (after returning the same night after time off due to a biceps injury) during a ten-man tag-team match, and the following week Vince McMahon disbanded The nWo. Eric Bischoff (acting as the Raw brand General Manager) later tried to make Michaels Triple H's manager. This led to a short-lived reformation of D-X, as Triple H turned on him the same night, setting off a long and heated feud that took approximately two years to resolve. The year after, Nash returned from injury as a fan favorite and sided with Michaels against Evolution (Triple H, Ric Flair, Batista and Randy Orton). = Later formations = Michaels and Triple H have reformed D-Generation X multiple times, first reuniting for a six-month stint on the June 12, 2006, edition of Monday Night Raw. They would feud against The Spirit Squad (Kenny, Johnny, Mitch, Nicky, and Mikey), Big Show and Vince McMahon, and later the team of Rated-RKO (Edge and Randy Orton), until Triple H's legitimate knee injury in the beginning of 2007. They would reform again on August 2009 during Shawn Michaels' last year in the WWE. During this year, D-Generation X would capture the Unified WWE Tag Team Championships at TLC: Tables, Ladders & Chairs against Jericho and Big Show, which would become the start of the first and only title reign for Triple H and Shawn Michaels as a tag team. D-Generation X would later go on to disband in March 2010 (after losing the tag Team titles to Big Show and The Miz). Michaels would then focus heavily on ending the winning streak of The Undertaker at WrestleMania, having failed to do so at WrestleMania XXV, and he would put his career on the line for their second WrestleMania encounter at WrestleMania XXVI which he would go on to lose and therefore end his career. Hall, Nash and Waltman (then working for Total Nonstop Action Wrestling) would reunite in a stable called The Band, where Hall and Nash won the TNA World Tag Team Championship, but Hall and Waltman were released shortly after (and Nash's contract would expire later on in the year). On April 2, 2011, The Kliq, consisting of Nash, Waltman, Triple H and Shawn Michaels, made a special appearance as Shawn Michaels was inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame 2011. Scott Hall decided not to attend the Hall of Fame ceremony or other WrestleMania XXVII festivities due to concerns of remaining sober. In 2014, at the conclusion of Scott Hall's Hall of Fame induction, the members of The Kliq joined him onstage and reunited for the first time since the curtain call incident. They reunited again in 2015 on an episode of Raw, and then again at Nash's Hall Of Fame induction. A December 2014 episode of WWE Network show The Monday Night War: WWE vs. WCW focused on The Kliq. = Other associates = Although the core WWE-promoted group of The Kliq has long been known there have always been rumours, suggestions and unofficial members either within the group or on the fringes looking in. The most consistently mentioned name is that of Peter Polaco who at the time of The Kliq's formation was working for WWF as Aldo Montoya and would later go on to gain fame as Justin Credible in Extreme Championship Wrestling. He apparently became friends with Scott Hall who offered to mentor him and from there he ended up travelling with the rest of the group until he negotiated his WWF release in 1997. During his \\"YouShoot\\" interview with Kayfabe Commentaries, Scott Hall confirmed Polaco's membership of The Kliq, stating \\"he is Kliq through-and- through\\".http://blogofdoom.com/index.php/2015/11/05/kayfabe-commentaries- presents-youshoot-with-scott-hall/ Polaco's association with the group is also lent weight by the fact that upon his return to WWF after the closure of ECW in 2001 he instantly aligned himself on TV with X-Pac with the two going on to form a short lived stable under the name of X-Factor along with Albert as the group's enforcer. Another name that has had a long association with The Kliq is that of Louie Spicolli, who was wrestling for the WWF in the early to mid 1990s under the name of Rad Radford. Spicolli's friendship with the group, much like Polaco's, descends from Scott Hall taking the youngster under his wing and having him travel with the rest of them on the road. Spicolli left the WWF after only a few months when he was released to deal with issues that he was having with substance abuse at the time. During this time, Spicolli worked for ECW for a number of months, during which time he could be seen using the now infamous \\"Wolf Head\\" signal during tapings and matches. In a later interview he denied the association, and asserted that the \\"Wolf Head\\" symbol was originally Bret Hart's gesture and The Wolfpac stole it. He said he used the symbol in ECW in order to \\"take it back.\\" In late 1997, Spicolli returned to the spotlight by signing with WCW and was soon placed on screen as the lackey of Scott Hall, with the two engaging in a feud with Larry Zbyszko. However, the feud was never able to finish due to Spicolli's untimely death from a drug overdose at the age of 27. His death was never publicly acknowledged by any member of the group at the time, with only Zbyszko mentioning it on screen. Prior to her death in 2016, Chyna had an association with the group, not only as an original member of D-Generation X, but also through her relationship with Triple H, along with another long-term relationship with Sean Waltman. Her link to The Kliq was unclear, with the details of her split from Triple H in 2000 never made public. Her relationship to Waltman was notorious for the release of a sextape in 2004 and Chyna being arrested for domestic assault in 2005 after a drug-fueled fight. It was thought the pair were no longer on speaking terms after going their separate ways to deal with a number of personal issues, including drug and alcohol addictions, as well as issues with depression. When Triple H was asked in 2015 about inducting Chyna into the WWE Hall of Fame, he cited the conflict between her work in the adult industry and WWE's current target audience as a reason it would not happen. However, when both Triple H and his wife Stephanie McMahon were asked the same question after Chyna died, they were both in favor of inducting her. The \\"Turkish Wolf\\" hand gesture used by members of The Kliq Other people in the business have often had their names dropped into the hat but have never said either way whether they consider themselves to be a part of the group. The highest profile of these is probably Sid Eudy, better known as Sycho Sid or Sid Vicious. Another high-profile name is Rick Rude, who was both a member of the original D-Generation X and the nWo. Rude was involved in an incident in which he appeared on both Nitro and Raw in the same night, protesting on Nitro about the treatment of Bret Hart during the Montreal Screwjob (Rude actually appeared on the live Nitro show with a mustache an hour before appearing on Raw (which was taped a week earlier) with a full beard). How this affected his standing in the group is unclear, however it has gone on record that prior to his death Rude was one of the most respected people in the business by members of The Kliq. Konnan is said to have enjoyed a very close friendship with both Nash and Hall during his run in WCW and was a member of both the nWo and the Wolfpac. Konnan was also influential in bringing in Sean Waltman to AAA for his run with the company throughout 2007 and 2008, with the two aligning on screen for a while as a part of La Legi√≥n Extranjera. Curt Hennig, who was once a tag team partner of Hall during their days in the AWA,Online World of Wrestling ‚Äì Curt Hennig & Scott Hall is also said to have had a long-running friendship with the group, and spent large amounts of his career working either with or against members of the group in various promotions. The Bullet Club stable seen in New Japan Pro Wrestling and Ring of Honor pays homage to The Kliq by using the Wolfpac hand symbol, as well as the \\"Too Sweet\\" catchphrase and D-X-style crotch chops. Its WWE offshoot, The Club, also uses the Wolfpac hand symbol. Bullet Club members Adam Cole and The Young Bucks (Matt Jackson and Nick Jackson) also created a subgroup named Superkliq.

Weekly While the show continues to air on numerous other sources,Le Show Host Harry Shearer Moves On - Los Angeles Magazine primarily public radio stations (listed at the end of each show), Shearer expressed dismay over losing his home base radio broadcast, without any noticeHarry Shearer doesn't sound happy about KCRW * - LA Observed or being allowed to say goodbye on the air.Harry Shearer on His Unhappy Split from KCRW - Los Angeles Magazine Shearer has since ended each program by stating that Le Show originated from the \\"'Change is Hard' Radio Network\\", referring to a press statement from KCRW announcing the show's departure from its lineup. At the beginning of the July 14, 2013 episode, Shearer announced that the program is now airing on KCSN, bringing the show back to the Southern California airwaves roughly three months after it was taken off the air at KCRW. While KCSN provides live streaming of the show as well as the archives thereof, WWNO in New Orleans has taken over hosting its broadcast and podcast feeds. In Shearer's eyes, this prompted the change to the \\"'Change is Easy' Radio Network\\" (maybe referring to the city's nickname \\"The Big Easy\\"). Several shows a year are broadcast from New Orleans, where Shearer has a residence. The New Orleans shows usually feature very prominent local musicians. Availability The program is carried on many NPR and other public radio stations throughout the US and abroad. It is also available internationally on NPR Worldwide, the American Forces Radio Network, USEN440 in Japan and over shortwave radio via WBCQ The Planet (7490 kHz). Since the merger of the XM and Sirius satellite radio services into SiriusXM Satellite Radio, the program is no longer available on the merged service; on which Shearer commented, \\"because I guess, you know, mergers are good\\". (Comment is at 57:06). The program also aired on NPR Berlin from its launch in 2006 through to its 2017 shutdown; it was not picked up by its successor, KCRW Berlin. The show is also available as podcasts of previous episodes from Shearer's website and as free downloadable files from Audible.com, The show is also available as a podcast on iTunes along with other KCRW programs, although KCRW no longer broadcasts the show. The podcasts differ from the broadcast and streaming versions, in that they generally include only a few seconds of the music Shearer spins for the show.The podcast and downloadable versions at HarryShearer.com and KCRW.com vary from 47 to 53 minutes in length. Exceptions are musical parodies and original songs written and performed by Shearer. News segments The show features a number of recurring news segments, each referred to by Shearer as \\"a copyrighted feature of this broadcast\\". Currently many episodes include the following: * Apologies of the Week (public apologies reported in the news) * News From Outside the Bubble (News stories from international sources, usually the UK) * News of the Warm (Shearer reads news on global warming) * The Trades (Shearer reads items from trade magazines) * News of Inspectors General (News reports of the findings of U.S. Government Inspectors General) Other news features that recur less often on the program include: * News of the Olympic Movement (news about Olympic snafus) * Burying the Lede (News stories with alarming tidbits buried down in the story) * News of the Atom (News of safety issues in the nuclear power industry) * News of the Godly (News items relating to religion and evangelism) * F is for FEMA (News stories concerning the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA)‚Äîusually showcasing some aspect of incompetence‚Äîparticularly focusing on the Hurricane Katrina aftermath) * Found Object Department (Shearer plays audio from network feeds that was not intended to air) * Leak of the Week (Starting about March 2013, a weekly report of oil leaks.) * Let's Get Scared (Shearer reads news stories with frightening implications) * Los Angeles Dog Trainer Corrections (Shearer reads the extensive and often unusual LA Times errata) * News from the Digital Wonderland (News items, usually negative, concerning the switch-over from analog to digital transmission systems) * Sos of the Week (instances of the word so being used to start a sentence in news programs) * Tales of Airport Security (sent in by listeners) * News of News Corp.

These are populated with such personalities as host Aviva Schlorman, reporter Ira Zipkin, political editor Jonathan Ziziks and others, all voiced by Shearer. Recurring parodies include: * All in All \\"CPR's weekly attempt to bring what's behind the news in front of the news and leave it there\\" * At Loggerheads \\"Dichotomous dialogue from both sides of the rhetorical divide\\" (debates on news topics) * Book Bag (Book review program hosted by Ira Zipkin) * The Edible Table (Lampoon of public radio shows such as The Splendid Table) * Karzai Talk (Call-in chat show, a satire of NPR's Car Talk using the fictional Afghanistan Public Radio starring President Hamid Karzai and his brother Ahmed Wali Karzai; After the 2011 assassination of \\"Wali\\", another brother Mahmud Karzai became the co-host. The title and style of the show lampoon NPR's Car Talk, of which Shearer has been critical (Shearer comments on Car Talk from 3:10 to 4:11)) In 2014 Shearer promoted Karzai Talk T-shirts. * Media Nation \\"CPR's weekly look into the world of the media and the media of the world\\" (host Chris Edwards is clearly intended to mimic Bob Edwards) * More Than You Know \\"The weekly public radio series that focuses on events and personalities outside your ken\\", host: Jacob Kitzle * Mouth to Mouth \\"An audio encounter with a personality in or out of the news\\" (Interview program) * News from Lake Reverie (A parody of the \\"News from Lake Wobegon\\" segment of A Prairie Home Companion) * Up To Here (Daily news & politics program) \\"A daily once-over not so lightly on the story at the top, of what's behind, today's news\\", hosted by Milton Getzler * What Up, Dog? \\"News blogozine for the young and the newsless\\"; host: Cody Outscoop (Parodies NPR's attempts to reach younger audiences such as Bryant Park Project) =Presidential or political parodies= Among the many presidential and political parodies are: * Alternative Scenario Playhouse \\"Duelling dramatizations from radio's premiere venue of bifurcated possibilities\\" (Shearer re-enacts two possible versions of events behind the news) * Clintonsomething (\\"Youthful angst and middle-aged power!\\" ‚Äî a thirtysomething parody) Retired at the end of the Clinton administration, reprised as Clintonsomething: The State Department Years with the appointment of Hillary Clinton as Secretary of State * Dick Cheney: Confidential (parody of hard-boiled detective stories) * Father Knows Best (parody of the 1950s television program, with Barack Obama as the father) * 41 calls 43 (George H.

Retired after Blackwell's death. * Super Bugs (stories about antibiotic- resistant bacteria with Superfly-styled theme song, new feature as of October 2011) =Comedy interviews= Shearer will interview someone in-studio or via telephone. For the phone interviews, he claims to be opening up the phone for listener calls (even though no phone number was announced) or will reveal that there is an incoming call on \\"the newsmaker line\\". These are among the few comedy segments in which voices other than Shearer's are heard. Many are voiced by writer Tom Leopold, who has worked with Shearer on several other projects. These include: * Tony Bellalaqua (a listener in the midwest) * Lyle Condit (Congressman Gary Condit's youngest brother) * David Feldman (A high school teacher and friend of Monica Lewinsky) * Yvonne Della Femina (a multiple-sex-change recipient with a storied past) * John Walker Lindh (the so-called \\"American Taliban\\") * Elvis Presley (on the issuance of his U.S. postage stamp) * Ira Rifleman (a listener who allegedly bought Scott Peterson's truck) * Tyler Michael Tucker (an actor from a failed TV program) Other personalities not voiced by Leopold include: * David Manning (the fictitious film reviewer, voiced by a computer voice synthesizer) * Ralph the Talking Computer (a computer synthesized voice) * Barry Saint-Martin aka Barry Saint-Michael (actor Alex Lowe) * Shabshab (a former Saddam Hussein lookalike and stereo salesman in Iraq voiced by Shearer) On very rare occasions Shearer has announced a phone number and taken actual listener calls. Interview segments A few times each year the show will feature Shearer conducting a serious interview as a major segment of the program, often with a musician who will play music as well. Sometimes these interviews will comprise the bulk of the program, other times they will be interspersed with the usual mix of other segments. =Musician interviews= Musicians are often pianists associated with New Orleans and will appear on one of the programs Shearer records in that city. They have included: * Marcia Ball * Henry Butler * Evan Christopher * Jon Cleary * Joe Krown * Phillip Manuel * Tom McDermott * Judith Owen (Shearer's wife, who also sings on some of the original comedic songs heard on the show) * David Torkanowsky * Allen Toussaint =Other interviews= Non- musicians interviewed will usually be a scientist or author who has insight into a news issue, often the Hurricane Katrina disaster in New Orleans. These have included: * John M. Barry on the levees in New Orleans and SLFPA * Dr. Robert Bea on levee failures in New Orleans during Katrina * Bill Black on the bank mortgage fraud and foreclosure crisis * Dan Cameron on the Prospect 1 New Orleans biennial art project * Lolis Eric Elie on reporting about New Orleans * Ivor van Heerden on the Katrina disaster in New Orleans * Stephanie Kelton, EconomistLe Show - New Economic PerspectivesNew Economic Perspectives * Jane Mayer on her book The Dark Side * Mort Sahl on his career as an American satirist * Scott Simon on reporting at the political conventions * Yves Smith on the bank mortgage fraud and foreclosure crisis with transcript Music segments \\"An eclectic mix of mysterious music\\" is how KCRW describes the music played between other segments on the program. The tracks are not announced on air, but the names are published a few days after the show airs on HarryShearer.com. Aside from the musicians already mentioned, tracks played frequently include such acts as Johnny Adams, Astral Project, Marcia Ball, The Beach Boys, The Beatles, The Bobs, Bonerama, Charles Brown, Oscar Brown, Jr., Henry Butler, Jon Cleary, Nat King Cole, Shawn Colvin, Ry Cooder, Elvis Costello, Dr. John, Dave Edmunds, Eliane Elias, Georgie Fame, Finn Brothers, Ella Fitzgerald, John Fogerty, Fountains of Wayne, Michael Franks, Marvin Gaye, Gilberto Gil, The Hi-Lo's, Dan Hicks, Dick Hyman, Jamiroquai, Louis Jordan, Keb' Mo', Sonny Landreth, Lenine, Los Lobos, Lyle Lovett, Phillip Manuel, Peter Martin, Paul McCartney, The Meters, Van Morrison, Mr. Scruff, Randy Newman, Rosa Passos, Nicholas Payton, Alan Price, Brian Protheroe, The Quantic Soul Orchestra, The Radiators, Bonnie Raitt, Marcus Roberts, Smokey Robinson, Shorty Rogers, The Rolling Stones, Kermit Ruffins, Alice Russell, Frank Sinatra, Jill Sobule, Steely Dan, They Might Be Giants, Irma Thomas, Richard Thompson, Mel Torm√©, The Whitlams, The Who, Brian Wilson, Charlie Wood & the New Memphis Underground, XTC and many others.

People so featured have included George Harrison, Ray Charles, Oscar Brown, Jr., Blossom Dearie, Les Paul, Robert Kirby, Gerry Rafferty, Jerry Ragovoy, B.B. King, and Prince. Segment theme music * The show opens with an archival recording of Ben Grauer saying \\"Here it is\\". For years, this was followed by Shearer saying, \\"From deep inside your radio...\\" over a fragment of classical music (Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart's Eine kleine Nachtmusik, 4th movement), a parody of the American Public Radio/Public Radio International/Minnesota Public Radio intro featuring the Brandenburg Concerto No. 6, 3rd movement by Bach. The opener was modified starting with December 13, 2015 episode with Shearer saying \\"From deep inside your audio device of choice...\\" over a fragment of contemporary electronic music. * A looped sample of \\"Uncle Albert/Admiral Halsey\\" by Paul McCartney is used for Apologies of the Week, with emphasis on McCartney saying \\"sorry\\". * Glenn Yarbrough singing the Rod McKuen song \\"Listen to the Warm\\" is used for News of the Warm.[ I Think Of You: Glenn Yarbrough Sings Rod McKuen] (1994) Laserlight Records.

On the July 16 edition of the program, Shearer claimed WPR was \\"displeased with the political content of the broadcast\\". WPR Director of Radio Phil Corriveau told the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel that the program's political content was a minor factor and the decision had to do with Le Show's consistency: \\"I think he's brilliant. But I think if you listen to the show, they can be brilliant, or they can really ramble on.\\"  References  External links *HarryShearer.com (includes a RealAudio archive of Le Show dating back to 1995) *leshow.sideshownetwork.libsynpro.com/rss Category:American variety radio programs Category:NPR programs Category:1983 radio programme debuts ","title":"Le Show"},{"id":"341001","text":"The General Association of General Baptists is a group of Baptists holding the doctrine of general atonement (that Christ died for all persons), whose membership is located mostly in the Midwestern United States. Though theologically similar to the General Baptists in England and early America, this body of General Baptists arose in the Midwestern United States in the 19th century through the work of Benoni Stinson (1798-1869), a United Baptist minister first in Kentucky and then in Indiana. Stinson was ordained in Kentucky in 1821, and evidently was already leaning toward or embracing Arminian theology. Shortly after he moved to Indiana, in 1822 the Wabash District Association decided to divide into two bodies, for convenience sake. Stinson's church would be in the new body, and he labored to have a statement that \\"the preaching that Christ tasted death for every man shall be no bar to fellowship\\" would be included in the articles of faith. The next fall, in 1823, the Liberty Baptist Church of Howell, Indiana was organized with 33 members, and Elder Stinson was called as pastor. Three other churches were soon organized, all in the Evansville, Indiana area. In October 1824, representatives from these four churches came together and organized the Liberty Association of General Baptists. This appears to be the first time the name \\"General\\" was officially associated with this movement. A number of General Baptist local associations were organized from 1824 to 1870. During this period, some attempts were made by the Liberty Association to correspond with the northern Free Will Baptists, but this appears to have eventually proved unsatisfactory to both parties. In 1870, a convention was called to meet with Harmony Church, Gallatin County, Illinois, with the idea of organizing a general association comprising all the annual General Baptist associations. Delegates from Liberty, Mt. Olivet and Ohio associations gathered and formed the General Association of General Baptists. This body has grown and developed until it now embraces about 60 associations, 816 churches and more than 73,000 members. The denominational headquarters are located in Poplar Bluff, Missouri, where they operate Stinson Press. The official denominational publication is The General Baptist Messenger. The General Association oversees publication of Sunday School literature, a home mission board, a foreign mission board, and the Oakland City University in Oakland City, Indiana. The General Association is a member of the National Association of Evangelicals and the Baptist World Alliance.

Operas in English: A Dictionary, p. 146. Scarecrow Press. The opera eschews traditional narrative in favor of a formalist approach based on structured spaces laid out by Wilson in a series of storyboards. The music was written \\"in the spring, summer and fall of 1975\\".Einstein on the Beach , CBS Masterworks recording. Glass recounts the collaborative process: \\"I put [Wilson‚Äôs notebook of sketches] on the piano and composed each section like a portrait of the drawing before me. The score was begun in the spring of 1975 and completed by the following November, and those drawings were before me all the time.\\" The premiere took place on July 25, 1976, at the Avignon Festival in France. The opera contains writings by Christopher Knowles, Samuel M. Johnson and Lucinda Childs. It is Glass's first and longest opera score, taking approximately five hours in full performance without intermission; given the length, the audience is permitted to enter and leave as desired. The work became the first in Glass's thematically related Portrait Trilogy, along with Satyagraha (1979), and Akhnaten (1983). These three operas were described by Glass as portraits of people whose personal vision transformed the thinking of their times through the power of ideas rather than by military force.  Composition and performance history  Glass and Wilson first met to discuss the prospects of a collaborative work, and decided on an opera of between four and five hours in length based around a historical persona. Wilson initially suggested Charlie Chaplin or Adolf Hitler, whom Glass outright rejected, while Glass proposed Mahatma Gandhi (later the central figure of his 1979 opera Satyagraha). Albert Einstein was the eventual compromise. The title appears to reference the post-apocalyptic novel On the Beach by Nevil Shute.\\"Einstein returns briefly\\" by John Rockwell, The New York Times, December 17, 1984 =1976 premiere and first tour= Einstein on the Beach premiered on July 25, 1976, at the Avignon Festival in France, performed by the Philip Glass Ensemble and presented by the Byrd Hoffmann Foundation. The opera was also staged that summer in Hamburg, Paris, Belgrade, Venice, Brussels and Rotterdam. The Byrd Hoffman Foundation in cooperation With the Metropolitan Own. Metropolitan Opera House held two performances in November 1976. Lucinda Childs, Robert Wilson pupil Sheryl S. Sutton and Samuel M. Johnson filled the primary characters; all three reappeared in the 1984 BAM revival. =1980s= The Brooklyn Academy of Music (BAM) next mounted the opera in 1984. A one-hour documentary about this production appeared on public television, titled Einstein on the Beach: The Changing Image of Opera. In 1988, opera director Achim Freyer (who had staged the world premiere of Glass's Akhnaten in Stuttgart, Germany, in 1984) designed and staged a reworked version in a highly abstract style, with new spoken texts from the early 20th century, at the Stuttgart State Opera. As with the premiere, this version was also conducted by Michael Riesman.Stuttgart State Opera, performance programme, 1988 =1990s= In 1992, a revival was mounted by International Production Associates that included the participation of Wilson, Glass and Childs. The production was re- staged at the McCarter Theatre at Princeton University. It subsequently toured to Frankfurt, Melbourne, Barcelona, Madrid, Tokyo, Brooklyn (BAM) and Paris. =2000s= In 2001, the opera was staged as an \\"opera-installation\\" at the former headquarters of the State Bank of the GDR in Berlin. It was conducted by Ari Benjamin Meyers, directed by , with stage design by Veronika Witte. The performance combined the concepts of opera and installation art, created by various artists for the production. The spectators were encouraged to wander through the exhibition, while the actions of the musicians could be followed on video screens. A different production by the same team, following the same principle, was staged on the Einstein anniversary in 2005 at the Berlin Parochialkirche. In 2007, Carnegie Hall presented a concert version of Einstein in which violinist Tim Fain appeared as soloist. The New York Times wrote about his performance, \\"And Tim Fain, the violinist, gave the solo passages in the second, fourth and fifth 'Knee Plays' and in the climactic, swirling 'Spaceship Interior' scene an electrifying, virtuosic workout.\\" Fain tours extensively with Phillip Glass in duo recitals and they always include the solo from \\"Knee Play 2\\" on their program.\\"At the Shore, Although the Water Is Shallower\\" by Allan Kozinn, The New York Times, December 8, 2007 =2010s= A revival with the participation of all the original collaborators was commissioned by the New York City Opera (NYCO) to open their 2009‚Äì10 season. When General Manager designate Gerard Mortier withdrew from NYCO, the revival, along with the rest of Mortier's programming, was canceled. The team that had organized the New York City Opera production put together another group to remount Einstein, under the management of Pomegranate Arts. After a month of rehearsals overseen by Glass, Wilson and Childs, the first performance in 20 years took place on January 20, 2012, presented by the University Musical Society at the Power Center for the Performing Arts on the campus of the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor (two additional performances that weekend followed). The performance featured Kate Moran and Helga Davis replacing Childs' and Sutton's roles respectively. Grammy Award-nominated violinist Jennifer Koh played the role of Einstein in the preview and alternated with Antoine Silverman for the subsequent tour. The other instrumental performers and solfege soprano for these performances are the current members of the Philip Glass Ensemble without Glass himself performing. The performers in the 2012 production included members of the Lucinda Childs Dance Company: Ty Boomershine, Matthew Pardo, Patrick O'Neill, Stuart Singer, Lonnie Poupard, Caitlin Scranton, Sharon Milanese, Katie Dorn, Katherine Helen Fisher, Anne Lewis, Shakirah Stewart, and Sarah Hillmon. The chorus for this revival was composed of sopranos Mich√®le Eaton, Melanie Russell, Lindsay Kesselman; altos Hai-Ting Chinn, Solange Merdinian, Kate Maroney; tenors John Kawa, Philip Anderson, Tomas Cruz; and basses Greg Purnhagen, Joe Damon Chappel, and Jason Charles Walker. The official tour began on March 16, 2012, (after a single preview the previous evening) with the premiere at the Op√©ra Berlioz in Montpellier, France. This was followed by performances at the Teatro Valli in Reggio Emilia, Italy; the Barbican Centre, London; the Sony Centre for the Performing Arts, Toronto; the Brooklyn Academy of Music Brooklyn, New York; Zellerbach Hall at the University of California, Berkeley, California; the Teatro del Palacio de Bellas Artes, Mexico City: in 2013, at Het Muziektheater/De Nederlandse Opera, Amsterdam; Hong Kong; Arts Centre Melbourne, Melbourne, Australia; Los Angeles Opera, Los Angeles: and, in 2014 there were performances in Paris and Berlin.

This was the first time the opera was filmed. A new staging of Einstein on the Beach premiered at the Opernhaus Dortmund, Germany, in April 2017. It was directed by and was the first production without Glass or Wilson personally involved.Einstein on the Beach, production details Opernhaus Dortmund, April 2017 The opera was also staged at the Grand Th√©√¢tre de Gen√®ve in 2019 as part of La Batie performing arts festival. That production was directed by .Grand Th√©√¢tre de Gen√®ve (2019). Einstein on the Beach  Synopsis  From the beginning of Glass and Wilson's collaboration, they insisted on portraying the icon purely as a historical figure, in the absence of a storyline attached to his image. While they did incorporate symbols from Einstein's life within the opera's scenery, characters, and music, they intentionally chose not to give the opera a specific plot.Robert Schwarz, Minimalists (London: Phaidon Press Limited, 1996) 135. This is in accord with Wilson's formalist approach, which he asserts creates more truth on stage than naturalist theater. Wilson structured Einstein on the Beach as a repeating sequence of three different kinds of space. Between major acts are shorter entr'actes known as \\"knee plays,\\" a signature technique that Wilson has applied throughout his oeuvre.Trevor Fairbrother, \\"Robert Wilson's Vision\\". (New York: Harry Abrams, 1991) p. 120 Propelling idea of \\"non-plot\\" within Einstein on the Beach, its libretto employs solf√®ge syllables, numbers, and short sections of poetry. In an interview, Glass comments that he originally intended for his audience to construct personal connections with Einstein as a character and with the music that he assigns to the icon. For example, the music within the first of the opera's \\"Knee Plays\\" features repeated numbers accompanied by an electric organ. Glass states that these numbers and solf√®ge syllables were used as placeholders for texts by the singers to memorize their parts, and were kept instead of replacing them with texts. This numerical repetition, however, offers an interpretation as a reference to the mathematical and scientific breakthroughs made by Einstein himself. Of further reference to the icon's image, everything on the originally staged set of Einstein on the Beach, from costumes to lighting, depicts specific aspects that refer to Einstein's life.David Cunningham, \\"Einstein on the Beach\\" in Writings on Glass: Essays Interviews and Criticism. Edited by Richard Kostelanetz. (New York: Schirmer Books, 1997)153. Overall, the music assigned to Einstein demonstrates a circular process, a repeating cycle that constantly delays resolution. This process uses both additive and subtractive formulas. The three main scenes within the opera‚Äî\\"Train\\", \\"Trial\\", and \\"Field/Spaceship\\"‚Äîallude to Einstein's hypotheses about his theory of relativity and his unified field theory. Specifically, themes within the opera allude to nuclear weapons, science, and AM radio. The opera consists of nine connected 20-minute scenes in four acts separated by \\"Knee Plays\\". Five \\"Knee Plays\\" frame the opera's structure and appear in between acts, while also functioning as the opening and closing scenes. Glass defines a \\"Knee Play\\" as an interlude between acts and as \\"the 'knee' referring to the joining function that humans' anatomical knees perform\\". While the \\"Knee Plays\\" helped to create the necessary time to change the scenery of Wilson's seven sets, these interludes also served a musical function. David Cunningham, a Glass scholar, writes that the intermittence of Glass's \\"Knee Plays\\" amongst the opera's four acts, serves as a \\"constant motif in the whole work\\". The opera requires a cast of two female, one male, and one male child in speaking roles (for the Wilson production); a 16-person SATB chamber chorus with an outstanding soprano soloist and a smaller tenor solo part; three reed players: flute (doubling piccolo and bass clarinet), soprano saxophone (doubling flute), tenor saxophone (doubling alto saxophone and flute); solo violin, and two synthesizers/electronic organs. The orchestration was originally tailored to the five members of the Philip Glass Ensemble, plus the solo violin.  Structure  The work is structured as follows: *Prologue (solo electric organ) * Knee Play 1 (electric organ, SATB chorus) * Act 1 ** Scene 1 ‚Äì Train (piccolo, soprano and tenor saxophones, solo soprano and alto voices, SATB chorus, two electric organs) ** Scene 2 ‚Äì Trial *** Entrance (three flutes, soprano and alto chorus, electric organ) *** \\"Mr. Bojangles\\" (solo violin, two flutes, bass clarinet, SATB chorus, two electric organs) *** \\"Paris\\"/\\"All Men Are Equal\\" (solo electric organ) * Knee Play 2 (solo violin) * Act 2 ** Scene 1 ‚Äì Dance 1 (piccolo, soprano and alto saxophones, solo soprano and alto voices, two electric organs) ** Scene 2 ‚Äì Night Train (solo soprano and tenor voices, two flutes, bass clarinet, SATB chorus, electric organ) * Knee Play 3 (SATB chorus a cappella) * Act 3 ** Scene 1 ‚Äì Trial/Prison *** \\"Prematurely Air-Conditioned Supermarket\\" (SATB chorus, electric organ) *** Ensemble (three flutes, two electric organs) *** \\"I Feel the Earth Move\\" (soprano saxophone, bass clarinet) ** Scene 2 ‚Äì Dance 2 (solo violin, solo soprano, SATB chorus, electric organ) * Knee Play 4 (solo violin, tenor and bass chorus) * Act 4 ** Scene 1 ‚Äì Building (two electric organs, improvisatory woodwinds and chorus, solo tenor saxophone) ** Scene 2 ‚Äì Bed *** Cadenza (solo electric organ) *** Prelude (solo electric organ) *** Aria (solo soprano, electric organ) ** Scene 3 ‚Äì Spaceship (flute, tenor saxophone, bass clarinet, solo violin, solo soprano voice, SATB chorus, two electric organs) * Knee Play 5 (solo violin, soprano and alto chorus, electric organ)  \\"I Feel the Earth Move\\"  \\"I Feel the Earth Move\\" is the third section in the Trial/Prison section of the opera. The section is written in the same style as the rest of the opera, but has an instrumentation of soprano saxophone and bass clarinet, omitting the electronic keyboard used in most of the segments in Einstein on the Beach. A poem by Christopher Knowles is read over the musical soprano saxophone and bass clarinet line and in the poem's meanderings, it mentions such \\"TV personalities\\" as David Cassidy. A shortened version of this piece was chosen along with three other selections from Einstein on the Beach to appear on another Philip Glass album Songs from the Trilogy, which also included selections from Glass's operas Satyagraha and Akhnaten. The section's title is a reference to a Carole King song of the same name, from her album Tapestry.  Recordings  Two \\"complete\\" recordings of the opera have been made: the first in 1978, initially released on the Tomato label (TOM-4-2901) in 1979, and later reissued by CBS Masterworks, followed by Sony Classical (both M4K 38875); the second in 1993, released that same year on the Nonesuch label (79323). The 1978 recording was held to 165 minutes in order to fit onto four LP records, i.e., the opening scene's repeats were considerably shortened. The 1993 recording encompassed 200 minutes, freed by the technology of the compact disc, although it was released on three CDs instead of the original's four. Michael Riesman conducted both recordings. In 1978, Lucinda Childs, Sheryl Sutton, Paul Mann, and Samuel M. Johnson performed the opera's texts, with Philip Glass Ensemble performer Iris Hiskey taking the soprano solo. In 1993 Childs and Sutton repeated their roles, while Gregory Dolbashian and Jasper McGruder replaced Mann and the late Mr. Johnson's roles respectively, and Jeremy Montemarano voiced the role of \\"The Boy;\\" Schuman sang the soprano role. Most of the participants in the Nonesuch recording had performed in Einstein on the Beach during its 1992 world tour. A 77-minute highlights CD from the 1984 Brooklyn Academy of Music performances, accompanied by a DVD documentary, was released by Philip Glass's personal label Orange Mountain Music in early September 2012,Philip Glass & Robert Wilson: Einstein on the Beach CD/DVD, Amazon.com and an extended recording, 217 minutes long, was released at the same time but available only by download from the iTunes Store. In October 2013, Pacifica Radio released a two disc set of a 1976 interview with Glass and Wilson conducted at The Kitchen and excerpts from a rehearsal of some excerpts from the opera, also performed at The Kitchen on March 19, 1976.\\"Discovering Philip Glass Einstein on the Beach\\" by bdeshazor, Pacifica Radio, 14 October 2013 The violin part for the work has been performed by Robert Brown (in the live 1976 production), Paul Zukofsky (in the 1979 recording), Tison Street (in the live 1984 production), Gregory Fulkerson (in the live 1992 production and 1993 recording) and an interchanging performance of Jennifer Koh and Antoine Silverman during the 2012/16 production. Anton Batagov recorded 3 transcription pieces (Scene 2 ‚Äì Trail 1 from act 1, scene 2 ‚Äì Night Train from act 2 and Knee Play 5) from this work on solo piano in his album Prophecies (2016, on Orange Mountain Music label). A 270-minute recording from January 2014 at the Th√©√¢tre du Ch√¢telet in Paris was released on DVD and Blu-ray in October 2016.Glass, P.: Einstein on the Beach (Ch√¢telet, 2014) (Blu-ray, HD) Opus Arte OABD7173D, Naxos Records  In popular culture  The title was used as inspiration for the Counting Crows 1994 song \\"Einstein on the Beach (For an Eggman)\\". Excerpts were used as background music for several shots in season 3, episode 5 (2017) of the Mr. Robot television series. In the episode \\"Out With Dad\\" of the TV series Frasier, the title character, an opera lover, says, \\"You see, there's a stunning woman who comes to the opera on the same nights we do. She has the box right across from ours. We've flirted a bit from a distance. I have laughed with her during Figaro, cried with her during Tosca. I even had a dream about her during Einstein on the Beach.\\" Excerpts from the movement \\"Knee Play 1\\" are played during a montage sequence in the 2005 Alex Gibney documentary film Enron: The Smartest Guys in the Room. At the 2013 Drum Corps International World Championship, the first-place winners, the Carolina Crown, earned a perfect score in the brass section when they performed parts of \\"Knee Play 3\\", \\"Trial/Prison\\", \\"Spaceship\\", and \\"Knee Play 5\\". Among the works of Peter Schickele's fictitious alter ego P.D.Q. Bach is one called Einstein on the Fritz (S. E=mc2).

Rosamond Johnson (1873‚Äì1954), for Lincoln's birthday in 1905. History \\"Lift Every Voice and Sing\\" was publicly performed first as a poem as part of a celebration of Abraham Lincoln's birthday by Johnson's brother John. In 1919, the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) dubbed it \\"the Negro national anthem\\" for its power in voicing a cry for liberation and affirmation for African-American people. The song is a prayer of thanksgiving for faithfulness and freedom, with imagery evoking the biblical Exodus from slavery to the freedom of the \\"promised land.\\" It is featured in 39 different Christian hymnals, and is sung in churches across North America. In 1939, Augusta Savage received a commission from the New York World's Fair and created a 16-foot (5 m) plaster sculpture called Lift Every Voice and Sing. Savage did not have funds to have it cast in bronze or to move and store it. Like other Fair temporary installations, the sculpture was destroyed at the close of the fair.Bearden, Romare and Henderson, Harry. A History of African- American Artists (From 1792 to the Present), pp. 168‚Äì180, Pantheon Books (Random House), 1993, Notable references and performances In 1923, the male gospel group Manhattan Harmony Four recorded the song as \\"Lift Every Voice and Sing (National Negro Anthem)\\". It was added to the National Recording Registry in 2016. The 1939 film Keep Punching features the song. In Maya Angelou's 1969 autobiography, I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings, the song is sung by the audience and students at Maya's eighth-grade graduation, after a white school official dashes the educational aspirations of her class. In 1972, Kim Weston sang the song as the opening number for the Wattstax Festival at the Coliseum in Los Angeles. This performance was included in the film Wattstax made by Wolper Films. The music direction and recording was overseen by Stax Records engineer Terry Manning. The 1989 film Do the Right Thing features a 30-second cover of the song, played on a solo saxophone by Branford Marsalis, during the opening logos. In 1990, singer Melba Moore released a modern rendition of the song, which she recorded along with others including R&B; artists Stephanie Mills, Freddie Jackson, Anita Baker, Dionne Warwick, Bobby Brown, Stevie Wonder, Jeffrey Osborne, and Howard Hewett; and gospel artists BeBe & CeCe Winans, Take 6, and The Clark Sisters, after which, \\"Lift Every Voice and Sing\\" was entered into the Congressional Record by Del. Walter Fauntroy (D-DC).Anderson, Susan Heller. \\"Chronicle\\", The New York Times, April 18, 1990. Retrieved January 20, 2009. It was also added to the National Recording Registry in 2016. In 2008, jazz singer Rene Marie was asked to perform the national anthem at a civic event in Denver, Colorado, where she caused a controversy by substituting the words of \\"Lift Every Voice and Sing\\" into the song. This arrangement of the words of \\"Lift Every Voice and Sing\\" with the melody of \\"The Star Spangled Banner\\" became part of the titular suite on her 2011 CD release, The Voice of My Beautiful Country. On January 20, 2009, the Rev. Joseph Lowery, a civil rights movement leader who co-founded and is a former president of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, used a near-verbatim recitation of the song's third stanza to begin his benediction at the inauguration ceremony for President Barack Obama. The family of Barack Obama, Smokey Robinson and others singing \\"Lift Every Voice and Sing\\" in the White House in 2014 On September 24, 2016, the song was sung by mezzo-soprano Denyce Graves and chorus at the conclusion of the opening ceremonies of the National Museum of African American History and Culture, at which Obama delivered the keynote address. On October 19, 2017, when white supremacist leader Richard Spencer spoke at the University of Florida, the university's carillon played \\"Lift Ev'ry Voice and Sing\\" to convey a message of unity. On April 14, 2018, Beyonc√© included the song in the setlist of her concert at Coachella and as part of the resultant concert film and live album. In 2020, Google played a spoken word version of the song in a Google Doodle celebrating the Juneteenth holiday, performed by LeVar Burton. In the same year, snippets of the song were played prior to and after Mike Phillips and West Byrd's recitation of the national anthem at NASCAR's 2020 Pocono 350. On July 2, 2020, the National Football League announced that the song would be played or performed live before the national anthem during the entirety of Week 1 of the 2020 regular season.

Geranium is also the botanical name and common name of a separate genus of related plants, also known as cranesbills. Both genera belong to the family Geraniaceae. Carl Linnaeus originally included all the species in one genus, Geranium, and they were later separated into two genera by Charles Louis L'H√©ritier de Brutelle in 1789. Pelargonium species are evergreen perennials indigenous to temperate and tropical regions of the world, with many species in southern Africa. They are drought and heat tolerant, but can tolerate only minor frosts. Some species are extremely popular garden plants, grown as houseplants and bedding plants in temperate regions. They have a long flowering period, with flowers mostly in purple, red and orange, or white.  Etymology  One of hundreds of garden and houseplant cultivars The name Pelargonium is derived from the Greek œÄŒµŒªŒ±œÅŒ≥œåœÇ, pelarg√≥s (stork), because the seed head looks like a stork's beak. Dillenius originally suggested the name 'stork', because Geranium was named after a crane ‚Äî \\"a œÄŒµŒªŒ±œÅŒ≥œåœÇ, ciconia, sicuti vocamus Gerania, Œ≥ŒµœÅŒ±ŒΩœåœÇ, grus\\" (as pelargos, stork, as we call the Gerania, geranos, crane). Despite the Latin, this should not be confused with the modern-day genus Ciconia, of birds in the stork family.  Description  Pelargonium occurs in a large number of growth forms, including herbaceous annuals, shrubs, subshrubs, stem succulents and geophytes. The erect stems bear five-petaled flowers in umbel-like clusters, which are occasionally branched. Because not all flowers appear simultaneously, but open from the centre outwards, this is a form of inflorescence is referred to as pseudoumbels. The flower has a single symmetry plane (zygomorphic), which distinguishes it from the Geranium flower, which has radial symmetry (actinomorphic). Thus the lower three (anterior) petals are differentiated from the upper two (posterior) petals. The posterior sepal is fused with the pedicel to form a hypanthium (nectary tube). The nectary tube varies from only a few millimeters, up to several centimeters, and is an important floral characteristic in morphological classification. Stamens vary from 2 to 7, and their number, position relative to staminodes, and curvature are used to identify individual species. There are five stigmata in the style. For the considerable diversity in flower morphology, see figure 1 of R√∂schenbleck et al. (2014) Leaves are usually alternate, and palmately lobed or pinnate, often on long stalks, and sometimes with light or dark patterns. The leaves of Pelargonium peltatum (Ivy-leaved Geranium), have a thick cuticle better adapting them for drought tolerance.  Taxonomy  Dillenius' introduction of the term 'Pelargonium' in Hortus Elthamensis 1732 Pelargonium inquinans, (Geranium Afric. arborescens), Hortus Elthamensis Pelargonium is the second largest genus (after Geranium) within the family Geraniaceae, within which it is sister to the remaining genera of the family in its strict sense, Erodium, Geranium, and Monsonia including Sarcocaulon. The Geraniaceae have a number of genetic features unique amongst angiosperms, including highly rearranged plastid genomes differing in gene content, order and expansion of the inverted repeat. =Genus history= The name Pelargonium was first proposed by Dillenius in 1732, who described and illustrated seven species of geraniums from South Africa that are now classified as Pelargonium. Dillenius, who referred to these seven species with apparent unique characteristics as Geranium Africanum (African Geranium) suggested \\"Possent ergo ii, quibus novi generis cupido est, ea, quorum flores inaequales vel et irrregulares sunt, Pelargonia vocare\\" (It would be possible therefore, if anyone wishes to make a new genus [of these geraniums] of which the flowers are unequal or irregular, to call them Pelargonia).The name was then formally introduced by Johannes Burman in 1738. However Carl Linnaeus who first formally described these plants in 1753 did not recognise Pelargonium and grouped together in the same genus (Geranium) the three similar genera Erodium, Geranium, and Pelargonium. Linnaeus' reputation prevented further differentiation for forty years. The eventual distinction between them was made by Charles L‚ÄôH√©ritier based on the number of stamens or anthers, seven in the case of Pelargonium. In 1774, P. cordatum, P. crispum, P. quercifolium and P. radula were introduced, followed by P. capitatum in 1790. = Circumscription = Pelargonium is distinguished from the other genera in the family Geraniaceae by the presence of a hypanthium, which consists of an adnate nectar spur with one nectary, as well as a generally zygomorphic floral symmetry. = Subdivision = De Candolle first proposed dividing the genus into 12 sections in 1824, based on the diversity of growth forms. (also available online at Gallica) Traditionally the large number of Pelargonium species have been treated as sixteen sections, based on the classification of Knuth (1912) who described 15 sections, as modified by van der Walt et al. (1977-1997) who added Chorisma, Reniformia and Subsucculentia. These are as follows; * section Campylia (Lindley ex Sweet) de Candolle * section Chorisma (Lindley ex Sweet) de Candolle * section Ciconium (Sweet) Harvey * section Cortusina (DC.) Harvey * section Glaucophyllum Harvey * section Hoarea (Sweet) de Candolle * section Isopetalum (Sweet) de Candolle * section Jenkinsonia (Sweet) de Candolle * section Ligularia (Sweet) Harvey * section Myrrhidium de Candolle * section Otidia (Lindley ex Sweet) de Candolle * section Pelargonium (Sweet) Harvey * section Peristera de Candolle * section Polyactium de Candolle * section Reniformia (Knuth) Dreyer * section Subsucculentia J.J.A. van der Walt = Phylogenetic analyses = All subdivision classifications had depended primarily on morphological differences till the era of phylogenetic analyses (Price and Palmer 1993).Robert A. Price and Jeffrey D. Palmer. Phylogenetic Relationships of the Geraniaceae and Geraniales from rbcL Sequence Comparisons. Annals of the Missouri Botanical Garden Vol. 80, No. 3 (1993), pp. 661-671 However phylogenetic analysis shows only three distinct clades, labelled A, B and C. In this analysis not all sections were monophyletic although some were strongly supported including Chorisma, Myrrhidium and Jenkinsonia, while other sections were more paraphyletic. This in turn has led to a proposal, informal at this stage of a reformulation of the infrageneric subdivision of Pelargonium. In the proposed scheme of Weng et al. there would be two subgenera, based on clades A+B, and C respectively and seven sections based on subclades. Subsequent analysis with an expanded taxa set confirmed this infrageneric subdivision into two groups which also correspond to chromosome length (<1.5 Œº, 1.5-3.0Œº), but also two subclades within each major clade, suggesting the presence of four subgenera, these correspond to clades A, B, C1 and C2 of the earlier analysis, A being by far the largest clade with 141 taxa. As before the internal structure of the clades supported monophyly of some sections (Myrrhidium, Chorisma, Reniformia, Pelargonium, Ligularia and Hoarea) but paraphyly in others (Jenkinsonia, Ciconium, Peristera). A distinct clade could be identified within the paraphyletic Polyactium, designated section Magnistipulacea. As a result, Polyactium has been split up to provide this new section, which in itself contains two subsections, Magnistipulacea and Schizopetala, following Knuth's original treatment of Polyactium as having four subsections. P. tetragonum P. cotyledonis P. acetosum P. tricolor P. crithmifolium Thus R√∂schenbleck et al. (2014) provide a complete revision of the subgeneric classification of Pelargonium based on four subgenera corresponding to their major clades (A, B, C1, C2); * subgenus Magnipetala Roeschenbl. & F. Albers Type: Pelargonium praemorsum (Andrews) F Dietrich * subgenus Parvulipetala Roeschenbl. & F. Albers Type: Pelargonium hypoleucum Turczaninow * subgenus Paucisignata Roeschenbl. & F. Albers Type: Pelargonium zonale (L.) L'H√©r. in Aiton * subgenus Pelargonium L'H√©r. Type: Pelargonium cucullatum (L.) Aiton Sixteen sections were then assigned to the new subgenera as follows, although many species remained only assigned to subgenera at this stage * subgenus Magnipetala 3 sections ** section Chorisma (Lindley ex Sweet) de Candolle - 4 species ** section Jenkinsonia (Sweet) de Candolle - 11 species ** section Myrrhidium de Candolle - 8 species * subgenus Parvulipetala 3 sections ** section Isopetalum (Sweet) de Candolle - 1 species (Pelargonium cotyledonis (L.)

Perennial to short lived, spreading subshrubs, rarely herbaceous annuals. Petals five, but may be four, colour mainly white. Mainly winter rainfall region of South Africa, spreading into summer rainfall region. One species in northern Namibia and Botswana. Two species in East Africa and Ethiopia. Chromosomes x=11 and 9. Subgenus Parvulipetala: Corresponds to clade B, with 39-42 species. Perennials, partly annuals. Petals five and equal, colour white or pink to deep purplish red. Mainly South Africa, but also other southern hemisphere except South America. a few species in East Africa and Ethiopia. Chromosomes x=7-19. Subgenus Paucisignata: Corresponds to clade C2, with 25-27 species. Erect sometimes trailing shrubs or subshrubs, rarely geophytes or semi- geophytes. Petals five and equal, colour pink to red sometimes white. Summer rainfall region of South Africa, spreading into winter rainfall region and northern Namibia, with a few species in tropical Africa, Ethiopia, Somalia, Madagascar, the Arabian Peninsula and Asia Minor. Chromosomes x=mainly 9 or 10, but from 4-18. Subgenus Pelargonium: Corresponds to clade A, with 167 species. Frequently xerophytic deciduous perennials with many geophytes and succulent subshrubs, less frequently woody evergreen shrubs or annual herbs. Petals five, colour shades of pink to purple or yellow. Winter rainfall region of South Africa and adjacent Namibia, spreading to summer rainfall area, and two species in tropical Africa. Chromosomes x=11, may be 8-10. =Species= Pelargonium has around 280 species. R√∂schenbleck et al lists 281 taxa. There is considerable confusion as to which Pelargonium are true species, and which are cultivars or hybrids. The nomenclature has changed considerably since the first plants were introduced to Europe in the 17th century. Distribution Pelargonium is a large genus within the family Geraniaceae, which has a worldwide distribution in temperate to subtropical zones with some 800 mostly herbaceous species. Pelargonium itself is native to southern Africa (including Namibia) and Australia. Southern Africa contains 90% of the genus, with only about 30 species found elsewhere, predominantly the East African rift valley (about 20 species) and southern Australia, including Tasmania. The remaining few species are found in southern Madagascar, Yemen, Iraq, Asia Minor, the north of New Zealand and isolated islands in the south Atlantic Ocean (Saint Helena and Tristan da Cunha) and Socotra in the Indian Ocean. The centre of diversity is in southwestern South Africa where rainfall is confined to the winter, unlike the rest of the country where rainfall is predominantly in the summer months. Most of the Pelargonium plants cultivated in Europe and North America have their origins in South Africa. Ecology Pelargonium species are eaten by the caterpillars of some Lepidoptera species, including the noctuid moth angle shades, Phlogophora meticulosa. The diurnal butterflies Cacyreus marshalli and C. tespis (Lycaenidae), native to southern Africa, also feed on Geranium and Pelargonium. C. marshallii has been introduced to Europe and can develop into a pest on cultivated Pelargoniums. It has naturalised along the Mediterranean, but does not survive the winter in Westen Europe. The Japanese beetle, an important agricultural insect pest, becomes rapidly paralyzed after consuming flower petals of the garden hybrids known as \\"zonal geraniums\\" (P. √ó hortorum). The phenomenon was first described in 1920, and subsequently confirmed.Davis, J.J. 1920. The green Japanese beetle. New Jersey Department of Agriculture Circular. 30: 33. Research conducted by Dr. Christopher Ranger with the USDA Agricultural Research Service and other collaborating scientists have demonstrated the excitatory amino acid called quisqualic acid present within the flower petals is responsible for causing paralysis of the Japanese beetle.Geraniums and Begonias: New Research on Old Garden Favorites (the March 2010 issue of Agricultural Research magazine.) Quisqualic acid is thought to mimic L-glutamic acid, which is a neurotransmitter in the insect neuromuscular junction and mammalian central nervous system. A study by the Laboratory of Apiculture & Social Insects group at the University of Sussex on the attractiveness of common garden plants to pollinators found that a cultivar of Pelargonium √ó hortorum was unattractive to pollinators in comparison to other selected garden plants such as Lavandula (lavender) and Origanum. =Pests and diseases= The geranium bronze butterfly is a pest of Pelargonium species. The larvae of the geranium bronze bore into the stem of the host plant, causing the stem to typically turn black and die soon after. Geranium bronze are currently listed as an A2 quarantine pest by the European and Mediterranean Plant Protection Organization and can cause significant damage to Pelargonium species. Cultivation Pelargonium triste, the first species of its genus to be cultivated, here shown in its native habitat in Cape Town Various types of Pelargonium are regular participants in flower shows and competitive events, with numerous societies devoted exclusively to their cultivation. They are easy to propagate vegetatively from cuttings. Zonal geraniums grow in U.S. Department of Agriculture hardiness zones 9 through 12. Zonal geraniums are basically tropical perennials. Although they are often grown as annuals, they may overwinter in zones as cool as zone 7.Minimum Temperatures for Geranium Plants =Cultivation history= The first species of Pelargonium known to be cultivated was P. triste, a native of South Africa. It was probably brought to the Botanical Garden in Leiden before 1600 on ships which had stopped at the Cape of Good Hope. In 1631, the English gardener John Tradescant the elder bought seeds from Rene Morin in Paris and introduced the plant to England. By 1724, P. inquinans, P. odoratissimum, P. peltatum, P. vitifolium, and P. zonale had been introduced to Europe. = Cultivars = Zonal pelargonium There was little attempt at any rational grouping of Pelargonium cultivars, the growing of which was revived in the mid-twentieth century, and the origins of many if not most were lost in obscurity. In 1916 the American botanist Liberty Hyde Bailey (1858‚Äì1954) introduced two new terms for zonal and regal pelargoniums. Those pelargoniums which were largely derived from P. zonale he referred to as P. √ó hortorum (i.e. from the garden), while those from P. cucullatum he named P. √ó domesticum (i.e. from the home). In the late 1950s a list (the Spalding List) was produced in the United States, based on nursery listings and the 1897 list of Henri Dauthenay. It described seven groups, listing each cultivar with the list of its originator, and in most cases a date. These were Species, Zonals, Variegated-Leaved, Domesticum (Regals), Ivy- Leaved, Scented-Leaved and Old. In the 1970s the British Pelargonium and Geranium Society produced a checklist and the Australian Geranium Society started to produce a register but it was not completed till its author, Jean Llewellyn's death in 1999. None of these were published. The most complete list in its time was the 2001 compilation by The Geraniaceae Group, which included all cultivars up to 1959. Registration of cultivars is the responsibility of the Pelargonium & Geranium Society (PAGS: formed in 2009 from the British Pelargonium and Geranium Society and the British and European Geranium Society) which administers the International Register of Pelargonium Cultivars. PAGS is the International Cultivar Registration Authority (ICRA) of the International Society for Horticultural Science for pelargoniums. Contrasting leaves: Ivy-leaved Group (Left) Zonal Group (Right) Cultivated pelargoniums are commonly divided into six groups in addition to species pelargoniums and primary hybrids. The following list is ordered by position in the PAGS classification. Abbreviations indicate Royal Horticultural Society usage. * A. Zonal (Z) * B. Ivy-leaved (I) * C. Regal (R) * D. Angel (A) * E. Unique (U) * F. Scented-leaved (Sc) * G. Species * H. Primary hybrids Of these, A, U and Sc groups are sometimes lumped together as Species Derived (Sppd). This term implies that they are closely related to a species from which they were derived, and do not fit into the R, I or Z groups. In addition to the primary groups, additional descriptors are used. The Royal Horticultural Society has created description codes. These include; * Cactus (Ca) * Coloured foliage (C) * Decorative (Dec) * Double (d) * Dwarf (Dw) * Dwarf Ivy-leaved (Dwl) * Frutetorum (Fr) * Miniature (Min) * Miniature Ivy- leaved (MinI) * Stellar (St) * Tulip (T) * Variegated (v) These may then be combined to form the code, e.g. Pelargonium 'Chelsea Gem' (Z/d/v), indicating Zonal Double with variegated foliage. Crosses between groups are indicated with an √ó, e.g. Pelargonium 'Hindoo' (R √ó U), indicating a Regal √ó Unique cross.  A. Zonal pelargoniums (Pelargonium √ó hortorum Bailey)  Pelargonium √ó hortorum (Zonal) These are known as zonal geraniums because many have zones or patterns in the center of the leaves, this is the contribution of the Pelargonium zonale parent. Common names include storksbill, fish or horseshoe geraniums. They are also referred to as Pelargonium √ó hortorum Bailey. Zonal pelargoniums are tetraploid, mostly derived from P. inquinans and P. zonale, together with P. scandens and P. frutetorum. Zonal pelargoniums are mostly bush-type plants with succulent stems grown for the beauty of their flowers, traditionally red, salmon, violet, white or pink. The scarlet colouring is attributed to the contribution of P. inquinans. Flowers may be double or single. They are the pelargoniums most often confused with genus Geranium, particularly in summer bedding arrangements. This incorrect nomenclature is widely used in horticulture, particularly in North America. Zonals include a variety of plant types along with genetic hybrids such as hybrid ivy-leaved varieties that display little or no ivy leaf characteristics (the Deacons varieties), or the Stellar varieties. Hybrid zonals are crosses between zonals and either a species or species-derived pelargonium. There are hundreds of zonal cultivars available for sale,Hutchinson Farm: Zonal Geraniums and like other cultivars are sold in series such as 'Rocky Mountain',Hutchinson Farm: Rocky Mountain Geraniums each of which is named after its predominant colour, e.g. 'Rocky Mountain Orange', 'White', 'Dark Red', etc.The University of Tennessee Gardens: Pelargonium x hortorum Rocky Mountain‚Ñ¢ 'Dark Red' 'Rocky Mountain Orange' (Zonal) *(i) Basic plants ‚Äì Mature plants with foliage normally exceeding 7\\" (180 mm) in height above the rim of the pot. For exhibition these should be grown in a pot exceeding \\" (120 mm) in diameter but not normally exceeding \\" (165 mm). *(ii) Dwarf plants ‚Äì Smaller than basic. Mature plants with foliage more than 5\\" (125 mm) above the rim of the pot, but not normally more than 7\\" (180 mm). For exhibition should be grown in a pot exceeding \\" (90 mm) but not exceeding \\" (120 mm). They should not exceed 200 mm in height, grown in an 11 cm pot. *(iii) Miniature plants ‚Äì Slowly growing pelargoniums. Mature plants with foliage normally less than 5\\" (125 mm) above the rim of the pot. For exhibition should be grown in a pot not exceeding \\" (90 mm). They should not exceed 125 mm in height, grown in a 9 cm pot. *(iv) Micro-miniature plants ‚Äì Smaller and more slowly growing than miniature pelargoniums. Mature plants with foliage normally less than 4\\" (100 mm) above the rim of the pot. They should not exceed 75 cm in height, grown in a 6 cm pot. Usually no separate classes for these in exhibition and will therefore normally be shown as Miniature Zonals. *(v) Deacon varieties ‚ÄìGenetic hybrid similar to a large Dwarf. For exhibition (when shown in a separate class), usually grown in a pot not exceeding 5\\" (125 mm), otherwise as for Dwarf Zonals. *(vi) Stellar varieties ‚Äì A relatively modern genetic hybrid originating from the work done by the Australian hybridiser Ted Both in the late 1950s and 1960s from crosses between Australian species and Zonal types. Easily identifiable by their distinctive half-star-shaped leaves and slim-petalled blooms which create an impression of being star shaped (or five fingered). Single varieties tend to have larger elongated triangular petals whereas doubles tend to have thin feathered petals that are tightly packed together. For exhibition purposes there is a separate class for 'Stellar' varieties, but being Zonals could be shown in an open class for Basic, Dwarf or Miniature Zonals (unless otherwise stated). Also known as \\"The Five- fingered Geraniums\\", \\"Staphysagroides\\", \\"Both‚Äôs Staphs\\", \\"Both‚Äôs Hybrid Staphs\\", \\"Fingered Flowers\\" and \\"Bodey‚Äôs Formosum Hybrids\\". Fancy-leaf zonal pelargoniums ‚Äì besides having green leaves with or without zoning, this group also have variable coloured foliage that is sometimes used in classifying for exhibition purposes, e.g. ‚ÄòBicolour‚Äô, ‚ÄòTricolour‚Äô, ‚ÄòBronze‚Äô or ‚ÄòGold‚Äô. Other foliage types are: ‚ÄòBlack‚Äô or ‚ÄòButterfly‚Äô. There are an increasing number of these plants with showy blooms; *(a) Bicolour ‚Äì includes those with white or cream veined leaves or those with two distinct colours with clearly defined edges, other than the basic zone. *(b) Tricolour ‚Äì (May be Silver Tricolour (usually called a Silver Leaf) or a Gold Tricolour). **(i) Gold Tricolour ‚Äì Leaves of many colours including red and gold, but usually with clearly defined edges of golden yellow and having a leaf zone, usually red or bronze, that overlays two or more of the other distinct leaf colours, so that the zone itself appears as two or more distinct colours. **(ii) Silver Tricolour or Silver Leaf ‚Äì These tend to resemble a normal bi-colour leaf plant with two distinct colours usually of green and pale cream or white; the third colour is usually made up of bronze zoning. When this zoning overlays the green part of the leaf it is deemed to represent a silver colour. *(c) Bronze Leaved ‚Äì Leaves of Green or Golden/Green with a heavy bronze or chestnut coloured centre zone which is known as a medallion. For exhibition purposes, when exhibited in specific ‚ÄòBronze‚Äô Leaf class ‚Äì Must have over 50% of leaf surface bronze coloured. The dwarf plant ‚ÄòOverchurch‚Äô which has a heavy bronze medallion. *(d) Gold Leaved ‚Äì Leaves coloured golden/yellow or green/yellow but not showing a tendency to green. For exhibition purposes, when exhibited in specific ‚ÄòGold‚Äô Leaf class ‚Äì Must have over 50% of leaf surface gold coloured. *(e) Black Leaved ‚Äì Leaves coloured black, purple-black or with distinct large dark zones or centre markings on green. *(f) Butterfly Leaved ‚Äì Leaves with a butterfly marking of distinct tone or hue in centre of leaf. This can be encompassed in many of the coloured leaf varieties. Zonal pelargoniums have many flower types, as follows: *(a) Single flowered (S) ‚Äì each flower pip normally having no more than five petals. This is the standard flower set for all Pelargoniums. *(b) Semi-double flowered (SD) ‚Äì each flower pip normally having between six and nine petals. *(c) Double flowered (D)‚Äì each flower pip composed of more than nine petals (i.e. double the standard flower set) but not ‚Äòhearted‚Äô like the bud of a rose, e.g. the dwarf ‚ÄòDovepoint‚Äô which has full double blooms. *(d) Rosebud (or noisette) flowered ‚Äì each bloom fully double and ‚Äòhearted‚Äô. The middle petals are so numerous that they remain unopened like the bud of a rose. *(e) Tulip flowered ‚Äì having semi-double blooms that never fully open. The large cup shaped petals open just sufficiently to resemble a miniature tulip. *(f) Bird's-egg group ‚Äì having blooms with petals that have spots in a darker shade than the base colour, like many birds eggs. *(g) Speckled flowered group ‚Äì having petals that are marked with splashes and flecks of another colour, e.g. ‚ÄòVectis Embers‚Äô. *(h) Quilled (or cactus-flowered group, or poinsettia in USA) ‚Äì having petals twisted and furled like a quill. ‚ÄúZonquil‚Äù pelargoniums result from a cross between Zonal pelargonium cultivars and P. quinquelobatum.  B. Ivy-leaved pelargoniums (derived from Pelargonium peltatum)  Pelargonium peltatum (Ivy-leaved) Also known as \\"ivy geraniums\\".Usually of lax growth (trailing), mainly due to the long thin stems, with thick, waxy ivy- shaped stiff fleshy evergreen leaves developed by the species P. peltatum to retain moisture during periods of drought. Much used for hanging pots, tubs and basket cultivation. In the UK the bulbous double-headed types are preferred whilst on the European continent the balcon single types for large- scale hanging floral displays are favoured. Ivy-leaved pelargoniums embrace all such growth size types including small-leaved varieties and genetic hybrid crosses, which display little or no zonal characteristics. May have bicolour leaves and may have flowers that are single, double or rosette. Ivy pelargoniums are often sold as series such as 'Great Balls of Fire', in a variety of colours such as 'Great Balls of Fire Burgundy'. Additional descriptive terms include; * Hybrid Ivy ‚Äî the result of ivy √ó zonal crosses, but still more closely resemble ivy-leaved pelargoniums. * Fancy leaf ‚Äî leaves with marked color variation, together with or other than green. * Miniature ‚Äî miniature leaves and flowers, stems with short nodes, and compact growth. e.g. 'Sugar Baby' listed as Dwarf Ivy (DwI) by RHS.  C. Regal pelargoniums (Pelargonium √ó domesticum Bailey)  'Karl Offenstein' (Regal) These are large bush-type floriferous evergreen pelargoniums. In addition to \\"Regals\\" they are also known as ‚ÄúShow Pelargoniums‚Äù. In the United States they are often known as the \\"Martha Washington\\" or ‚Äò\\"Lady Washington\\" pelargoniums. They are grown primarily for the beauty and richness of their flower heads, which are large. Most of those cultivars grown currently are the result of hybridization over the last 50 years. They are very short-jointed and compact, which results in their requiring very little work in order to create a floriforous and well-rounded plant. Flowers are single, rarely double, in mauve, pink, purple or white. They have rounded, sometimes lobed or partially toothed (serrated) leaves, unlike the Zonal groups, without any type of zoning. Additional descriptive terms include; * Fancy leaf ‚Äì Leaves with marked variations in colour * Decorative pelargoniums (Decoratives) ‚Äì Descendants of older, less compact, smaller-flowered varieties that are more suited to outdoor conditions. These have smaller flowers than Regal, but are otherwise similar. e.g. ‚ÄòRoyal Ascot‚Äô * Miniature ‚Äì Flowers and leaves similar to Regal, but miniature in form, with compact growth. Other terms include ‚ÄúPansy Geraniums‚Äù or ‚ÄúPansy Pelargoniums‚Äù. e.g. ‚ÄòLara Susan‚Äô * Oriental pelargoniums ‚Äì The result of crosses between Regals and members of the Angel group (see below). Some have bicolour foliage.  D. Angel pelargoniums (derived from Pelargonium crispum)  'Angeleyes Randy' (Angel) Angel pelargoniums are similar to Regal pelargoniums but more closely resemble P. crispum in leaf shape and growth habit. The majority of Angel cultivars originate from a cross between P. crispum and a Regal variety in the early part of the 20th century. Angels have grown in popularity in the last 30 years or so due mainly to an explosion of new varieties being released by specialist nurseries resulting from the work done by dedicated amateur hybridisers. These hybrisers have managed to obtain many new flower colour breaks and tighter growth habits resulting in plants suitable for all sorts of situations. Angels basically have the appearance of a small Regal with small serrated leaves and much smaller flowers and are more compact and bushy. The group extends to include similar small-leaved and -flowered types but usually with P. crispum in their parentage. They are mostly upright bush-type plants but there are some lax varieties that can be used for basket or hanging pot cultivation. Often called \\"pansy-faced\\" in the US. Some varieties have bicolour foliage. Other terms include ‚ÄòLangley-Smith Hybrids‚Äô.  E. Unique pelargoniums (derived from Pelargonium fulgidum)  'White Unique' (Unique) Unique in sense of not fitting into any of the above categories. The parentage of Unique pelargoniums is confused and obscure. One theory being a derivation from P. fulgidum, but a derivation from an older cultivar 'Old Unique‚Äô, also known as or ‚ÄòRollinson‚Äôs Crimson‚Äô, in the mid-19th century is also claimed. Unique pelargoniums resemble upright Scented Leaf pelargoniums in being shrubby and woody evergreens. They have distinctly scented leaves, and small flowers with blotched and feathered petals. They may have bicolour foliage. Some types, popularly known in the hobby as hybrid Uniques, have been crossed with Regal pelargoniums and, as a result of this cross, are much more floriferous. ; Cultivar: * Fiery-flowered Stork's-bill, Scarlet Unique Scented Geranium (P. √ó ignescens) - a P. fulgidum hybrid  F. Scented-leaved pelargoniums  Pelargonium graveolens (Scented leaf) Shrubby evergreen perennials grown chiefly for their fragrance, may be species or cultivars but all must have a clear and distinct scented foliage. Scent is emitted when the leaves are touched or bruised with some scents aromatic, others pungent and in a few cases, quite unpleasant. Several of the scented leaved pelargoniums are grown for the oil geraniol, which is extracted from the leaves and is an essential oil much used commercially in perfumery. The scent of some species growing in their natural habitat, acts as a deterrent to grazing animals who appear to dislike the emitted scent. Conversely, it also attracts other insect life to visit the bloom and pollinate the plant. The scented leaves can be used for potpourri and they also have a use as flavourings in cooking. Occasionally scented types can be found in some of the other groups mentioned; for example, the Angels, having P. crispum in their genetic makeup, can often have a strong citrus scent. Leaves are lobed, toothed, incised or variegated. Growth habit is very variable, but the flowers are less prominent than other groups, and most closely resemble the species they originated from. These include: Pelargonium quercifolium 'Fair Ellen' (Scented leaf) Pelargonium ionidiflorum (Scented leaf) * Almond - Pelargonium quercifolium * Apple - Pelargonium odoratissimum * Apple - Pelargonium cordifolium * Apple/Mint - Pelargonium album * Apricot/Lemon - Pelargonium scabrum * Balsam - Pelargonium panduriforme * Camphor - Pelargonium betulinum * Celery - Pelargonium ionidiflorum * Cinnamon - Pelargonium 'Ardwyck Cinnamon' * Coconut - Pelargonium grossalarioides (Pelargonium parriflorum) * Eau de Cologne - Pelargonium 'Brilliantine' * Eucalyptus - Pelargonium 'Secret Love' * Grapefruit - Pelargonium 'Poquita' * Ginger - Pelargonium 'Torrento' or 'Cola Bottles' which is a variety of Pelargonium x nervosum * Hazelnut - Pelargonium 'Odorata Hazelnut * Lavender - Pelargonium 'Lavender Lindy' * Lemon - Pelargonium crispum * Lemon - Pelargonium citronellum (Synonym - Pelargonium 'Mabel Grey') * Lemon Balm - Pelargonium x melissinum * Lime - Pelargonium x nervosum * Myrrh - Pelargonium myrrhifolium * Nutmeg - Pelargonium x fragrans * Old Spice - Variety of Pelargonium x fragrans * Orange - Pelargonium x citriodorum (Synonym - Pelargonium 'Prince of Orange') * Peach - Pelargonium 'Peaches and Cream' * Peppermint - Pelargonium tomentosum * Pine - Pelargonium denticulatum * Pineapple - Pelargonium 'Brilliant' * Raspberry - Pelargonium 'Red Raspberry' * Rose - Pelargonium graveolens (Synonym - Pelargonium roseum) * Rose - Pelargonium capitatum * Rose - Pelargonium radens * Southernwood - Pelargonium abrotanifolium * Spicy - Pelargonium exstipulatum * Strawberry - Pelargonium x scarboroviae ; Cultivars: * 'Attar of Roses' - a cultivar of P. capitatum * 'Crowfoot Rose' - a cultivar of P. radens * 'Dr. Livingston' - a cultivar of P. radens * 'Grey Lady Plymouth' - a cultivar of P. graveolens * 'Prince Rupert' - a cultivar of P. crispum  G. Species pelargoniums  The species are the forefathers of all the cultivar groups listed above. In general, the definition of a species is that it breeds true, and is to be found doing this in the \\"wild\\". Species pelargoniums have a large diversity of characteristics in habit, shape, size and colour, which probably accounts for them having retained their popularity for more than 300 years.  H. Primary hybrids  A primary hybrid is recognised as being the resultant plant from a first-time cross between two different known species. Examples are P. √ó ardens ‚Äì from P. lobatum √ó P. fulgidum (1810). P. √ó glauciifolium ‚Äì from P. gibbosum √ó P. lobatum (1822). Usually, but not always, primary hybrids are sterile. =List of AGM pelargoniums= 'Attar of Roses' 'Lady Plymouth' 'Mabel Gray' The following is a selection of pelargoniums which have gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit: *'Attar of Roses' (rose scented leaves, pink flowers) *'Citriodorum' (lemon scented leaves, rose pink flowers) *'Dolly Varden' (variegated leaves, scarlet flowers) *'Frank Headley' (cream vareigated leaves, salmon pink flowers) *'Fringed Aztec' (regal group - white & purple fringed flowers) *'Gemstone' (scented leaves, pink flowers) *'Grace Thomas' (lemon scented leaves, pale pink flowers) *'Joy' (pink & white frilled flowers) *'Lady Plymouth' (P. graveolens variegata - small mauve flowers) *'Lara Candy Dancer' (scented leaves, pale mauve flowers) *'Lara Starshine' (aromatic leaves, lilac flowers) *'L'√âl√©gante' (ivy-leaved, trailing, white and purple flowers) *'Mabel Grey' (lemon-scented leaves, mauve flowers) *'Mrs Quilter' (bronze leaves, salmon pink flowers) *'Radula' (lemon & rose scented leaves, pink & purple flowers) *'Royal Oak' (balsam scented leaves, mauve flowers) *'Spanish Angel' (lilac & magenta flowers) *'Sweet Mimosa' (balsam-scented leaves, pale pink flowers) *'Tip Top Duet' (pink & wine-red flowers) *'Voodoo' (crimson & black flowers) *P. tomentosum (peppermint-scented leaves, small white flowers) Usage = Ornamental plants = Pelargoniums rank as one of the highest number of potted flowering plants sold and also in terms of wholesale value. = Scented leaf pelargoniums = Other than being grown for their beauty, species such as P. graveolens are important in the perfume industry and are cultivated and distilled for their scents. Although scented pelargoniums exist which have smells of citrus, mint, pine, spices or various fruits, the varieties with rose scents are most commercially important. Pelargonium distillates and absolutes, commonly known as \\"scented geranium oil\\" are sometimes used to supplement or adulterate expensive rose oils. The oils of the scented pelargoniums contain citronellol, geraniol, eugenol, alpha pinene and many other compounds. The edible leaves and flowers are also used as a flavouring in desserts, cakes, jellies and teas. Scented-leafed pelargoniums can be used to flavor jellies, cakes, butters, ice cream, iced tea and other dishes, The rose-, lemon- and peppermint-scents are most commonly used. Also used are those with hints of peach, cinnamon and orange. Commonly used lemon-scented culinary species include P. crispum and P. citronellum. Rose-scenteds include P. graveolens and members of the P. graveolens cultivar group. Other species and cultivars with culinary use include the lime-scented P. ‚ÄòLime‚Äô, the lemon balm-scented P. ‚ÄòLemon Balm‚Äô, the strawberry-lemon-scented P. ‚ÄòLady Scarborough‚Äô and the peppermint-scented P. tomentosum. =Herbal medicine= In herbal medicine, Pelargonium has been used for intestinal problems, wounds and respiratory ailments, but Pelargonium species have also been used for fevers, kidney complaints and other conditions. Geranium (Pelargonium) oil is considered a relaxant in aromatherapy, and in recent years, respiratory/cold remedies made from P. sidoides and P. reniforme have been sold in Europe and the United States. P. sidoides along with Echinacea is used for bronchitis. P. odoratissimum is used for its astringent, tonic and antiseptic effects. It is used internally for debility, gastroenteritis, and hemorrhage and externally for skin complaints, injuries, and neuralgia and throat infections. The essential oil is used in aromatherapy. = Chemistry = Pelargonin (pelargonidin 3,5-O-diglucoside) is a petal pigment of the scarlet pelargonium.  Culture  The chemist, John Dalton, first realized that he was color blind in 1794 when he heard others describe the color of the flowers of the pink Pelargonium zonale as pink or red, when to him it looked either pink or blue, having no relationship to red at all.

It is a long-distance migrant moving in winter to Africa and southern Asia. The scientific name is from Latin. Anthus is the name for a small bird of grasslands, and the specific trivialis means \\"common\\", from trivium, \\"public street\\". This is a small pipit, which resembles meadow pipit. It is an undistinguished-looking species, streaked brown above and with black markings on a white belly and buff breast below. It can be distinguished from the slightly smaller meadow pipit by its heavier bill and greater contrast between its buff breast and white belly. Tree pipits more readily perch in trees. The call is a strong spek, unlike the weak call of its relative. The song flight is unmistakable. The bird rises a short distance up from a tree, and then parachutes down on stiff wings, the song becoming more drawn out towards the end. The breeding habitat is open woodland and scrub. The nest is on the ground, with 4‚Äì8 eggs being laid. This species is insectivorous, like its relatives, but will also take seeds. Life cycle *mid-September to mid- April: lives in sub Saharan Africa *mid April to beginning of May: migrates and arrives in countries such as the United Kingdom *beginning of May to August: breeding season, two broods *August to mid September: flies back to Saharan Africas Management and conservation They breed in habitats with a wooded component, including Lowland heath and coppice. They are found mostly in open birch woodland on the boundary with moorland, or open structured oak woodland ‚Äì therefore heavy thinning is required to produce a gappy character. They prefer low canopy medium-sized trees, where there is low-growing scrub and bramble less than 2 metres high, so that horizontal visibility is relatively high. They like a mosaic of grass and bracken, but not very grazed short turf, so light to moderate grazing is preferred. Glades are also valuable, and streams are preferred. Once they have arrived they nest on the ground amongst grass or heather tussocks. They forage on invertebrates found in the ground vegetation. They need scattered trees as song perches.RSPB Woodland Management For Birds ‚Äì Pied Flycatcher =Grant funding for conservation= The Forestry Commission offers grants under a scheme called England's Woodland Improvement Grant (EWIG); as does Natural Englands Environmental Stewardship Scheme.

Urban geographers and urbanistsSoja, Edward W. \\"Taking space personally.\\" In The Spatial Turn, pp. 27-51. Routledge, 2008. examine various aspects of urban life and the built environment. Scholars, activists, and the public have participated in, studied, and critiqued flows of economic and natural resources, human and non-human bodies, patterns of development and infrastructure, political and institutional activities, governance, decay and renewal, and notions of socio-spatial inclusions, exclusions, and everyday life. Research interest Urban geographers are primarily concerned with the ways in which cities and towns are constructed, governed and experienced. Alongside neighboring disciplines such as urban anthropology, urban planning and urban sociology, urban geography mostly investigates the impact of urban processes on the earth's surface's social and physical structures. Urban geographical research can be part of both human geography and physical geography. The two fundamental aspects of cities and towns, from the geographic perspective are:Carter (1995), p. 5‚Äì7. \\"[...] the two main themes of study introduced at the outset: the town as a distributed feature and the town as a feature with internal structure, or in other words, the town in area and the town as area.\\" # Location (\\"systems of cities\\"): spatial distribution and the complex patterns of movement, flows and linkages that bind them in space; and # Urban structure (\\"cities as systems\\"): study of patterns of distribution and interaction within cities, from quantitative, qualitative, structural, and behavioral perspectives. Research topics =Cities as centers of manufacturing and services= Cities differ in their economic makeup, their social and demographic characteristics, and the roles they play within the city system. One can trace these differences back to regional variations in the local resources on which growth was based during the early development of the urban pattern and in part to the subsequent shifts in the competitive advantage of regions brought about by changing locational forces affecting regional specialization within the framework of a market economy. The recognition of different city types is critical for the classification of cities in urban geography. For such classification, emphasis given in particular to functional town classification and the basic underlying dimensions of the city system. The purpose of classifying cities is twofold. On the one hand, it is undertaken to search reality for hypotheses. In this context, the recognition of different types of cities on the basis of, for example, their functional specialization may enable the identification of spatial regularities in the distribution and structure of urban functions and the formulation of hypotheses about the resulting patterns. On the other hand, classification is undertaken to structure reality in order to test specific hypotheses that have already been formulated. For example, to test the hypotheses that cities with a diversified economy grow at a faster rate then those with a more specialized economic base, cities must first be classified so that diversified and specialized cities can be differentiated. The simplest way to classify cities is to identify the distinctive role they play in the city system. There are three distinct roles: # central places functioning primarily as service centers for local hinterlands # transportation cities performing break-of-bulk and allied functions for larger regions # specialized-function cities, dominated by one activity such as mining, manufacturing or recreation and serving national and international markets The composition of a city's labor force has traditionally been regarded as the best indicator of functional specialization, and different city types have been most frequently identified from the analysis of employment profiles. Specialization in a given activity is said to exist when employment in it exceeds some critical level.See Duncan, Otis Dudley, and Albert J. Reiss. \\"Social characteristics of urban and rural communities, 1950.\\" (1956). The relationship between the city system and the development of manufacturing has become very apparent. The rapid growth and spread of cities within the heartland-hinterland framework after 1870 was conditioned to a large extent by industrial developments, and the decentralization of population within the urban system in recent years is related in large part to the movement of employment in manufacturing away from traditional industrial centers. Manufacturing is found in nearly all cities, but its importance is measured by the proportion of total earnings received by the inhabitants of an urban area. When 25 percent or more of the total earnings in an urban region derive from manufacturing, that urban area is arbitrarily designated as a manufacturing center. The location of manufacturing is affected by myriad economic and non- economic factors, such as the nature of the material inputs, the factors of production, the market and transportation costs. Other important influences include agglomeration and external economies, public policy and personal preferences. Although it is difficult to evaluate precisely the effect of the market on the location of manufacturing activities, two considerations are involved: * the nature of and demand for the product * transportation costs = Urbanization = Urbanization, the transformation of population from rural to urban, is a major phenomenon of the modern era and a central topic of study.Carter (1995), p. 17. \\"This latter fact emphasizes that 'the most conspicuous feature of today's accelerated world population growth is its even greater rapidity of urbanization. In many periods of history, populations have grown, but the tempo and dimensions of recent years have never been equalled' (United Nations, 1969). It follows that urbanization is the predominant process in the spatial organization of the world's population and it is this which makes its geographical study an imperative and perhaps puts the niceties of definition into proper perspective.\\"  History of the discipline  Urban geography arrived as a critical sub-discipline with the 1973 publication of David Harvey's Social Justice and the City, which was heavily influenced by previous work by Anne Buttimer.Buttimer, Anne. \\"Social Space in Interdisciplinary Perspective.\\" Geographical Review 59, no. 3 (1969): 417-26. doi:10.2307/213485. Prior to its emergence as its own discipline, urban geography served as the academic extension of what was otherwise a professional development and planning practice.Hall, Peter. Cities of tomorrow. Oxford: Blackwell Publishers, 1988. At the turn of the 19th century, urban planning began as a profession charged with mitigating the negative consequences of industrialization as documented by Friedrich Engels in his geographic analysis of the condition of the working class in England, 1844.Engels, Friedrich. The condition of the working class in England in 1844. London: Allen and Unwin, 1892. In a 1924 study of urban geography, Marcel Aurousseau observed that urban geography cannot be considered a subdivision of geography because it plays such an important part. However, urban geography did emerge as a specialized discipline after World War II, amidst increasing urban planning and a shift away from the primacy of physical terrain in the study of geography. Chauncy Harris and Edward Ullman were among its earliest exponents.Carter (1995), pp. 1‚Äì4.Kaplan et al. (2004), p. 4. \\"The first half of the 20th century saw the gradual emergence of the field of urban geography, which was based on several fundamental concepts developed by a limited number of scholars. The first courses in urban geography were not taught until the 1940s (by Chauncy Harris, the father of urban geography,at Indiana University and by Edward Ullman at Harvard University)> The second half of the 20th century then witnessed the development of urban geography as a major substantive subdiscipline in geography. At the dawn of the 21st century, only the technical field of geographic information sciences had more members in the leading and largest professional geography society, the Association of American Geographers (AAG) than the urban geography group did.\\" Urban geography arose by the 1930s in the Soviet Union as an academic complement to active urbanization and communist urban planning, focusing on cities' economic roles and potential.G.M. Lappo & N.V. Petrov, Urban Geography in the Soviet Union and the United States; Lanham, Maryland: Rowman & Littlefield, 1992; ; pp. 15‚Äì20. Spatial analysis, behavioral analysis, Marxism, humanism, social theory, feminism, and postmodernism have arisen (in approximately this order) as overlapping lenses used within the field of urban geography in the West.Kaplan et al. (2004), pp. 8‚Äì11. Geographic information science, using digital processing of large data sets, has become widely used since the 1980s, with major applications for urban geography.Kaplan et al.

He was famous for his work in a piano trio in which he collaborated with Isaac Stern and Leonard Rose. Career Born in New York City of Russian parents, Istomin was a child prodigy. His earliest public performances began at age six with his mother, and at 12 he entered the Curtis Institute, having had earlier advice from Alexander Siloti and his daughter Kyriena. He went on to study under Rudolf Serkin and also Mieczys≈Çaw Horszowski. In 1943, at the age of 17, he won the Leventritt award and the Philadelphia Youth Award. He made his debut with the Philadelphia Orchestra with Eugene Ormandy, playing a concerto by Chopin, and the New York Philharmonic conducted by Artur Rodzi≈Ñski playing Brahms' Piano Concerto No. 2 in the same week in 1943. He performed with the conductor Rodzinski and the New York Philharmonic a second time in December 1944, playing Beethoven's Fourth Piano Concerto. He commissioned and premiered Roger Sessions' piano concerto in 1956. Several other composers, including Henri Dutilleux and Ned Rorem, wrote music for him. The Istomin-Stern-Rose Trio he formed with Isaac Stern and Leonard Rose made many recordings, particularly of music by Beethoven, Brahms and Schubert. He won a Grammy Award in 1970 with the Istomin-Stern-Rose Trio for their recordings of Beethoven. He also was known as a soloist, performing many concerts of orchestral music, with conductors such as Eugene Ormandy, Bruno Walter, Leonard Bernstein, Fritz Reiner, George Szell and Leopold Stokowski. He recorded extensively for Columbia (later Sony Classical), solo works and chamber music. As late as 2001, he made the world premiere recording of Paul Paray's Fantaisie for Piano and Orchestra, with the Budapest Symphony Orchestra under Jean-Bernard Pommier. He married Marta Monta√±ez Martinez (Marta Casals Istomin), the widow of Pablo Casals, on February 15, 1975. She is a former president of the Manhattan School of Music and former artistic director of the Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in Washington, D.C. He moved to Washington in 1980. He was an avid reader and book collector and, eventually, attracted the interest of New York publishing magnate, William Jovanovich. In 1980, Istomin was hired by Harcourt Brace Jovanovich Publishers to advise the company in the publication of facsimile editions of original editions by Joseph Conrad and Thomas Hardy, among others. In the 1980s and 1990s, he toured 30 American cities‚Äîlargely in the Midwest‚Äîin a twelve-ton truck with his own Steinway pianos and piano tuner. It was the expression of a lifelong conviction that classical music belonged to the ordinary American. In this same vein, he was an ardent fan of the Detroit Tigers baseball team. Better known in Europe than in the United States, Eugene Istomin received the French L√©gion d'honneur in 2001. He died of liver cancer in 2003 at his home in Washington.

This warbler is migratory and winters mainly in India. The English name and the specific humei bird commemorate Allan Octavian Hume, a British civil servant and ornithologist based in India. The genus name Phylloscopus is from Ancient Greek phullon, \\"leaf\\", and skopos, \\"seeker\\" (from skopeo, \\"to watch\\"). Like most similar songbirds, it was formerly included in the \\"Old World warbler\\" assemblage. Description At Biskeri Thatch (1,1000 ft ASL) in Kullu district, Himachal Pradesh (India) Hume's leaf warbler is one of the smallest \\"Old World warblers\\". Like most other leaf warblers, it has greenish upperparts and off- white underparts. With its long supercilium, crown stripe and yellow-margined tertial remiges, it is very similar to the yellow-browed warbler (P. inornatus). However, it has only one prominent light wing bar, just a faint vestige of the second shorter wing bar, and overall duller colours. It also has a dark lower mandible and legs. Its song is buzzing and high pitched. The best distinction from the yellow-browed warbler is the more disyllabic call. While the eastern and western Hume's leaf warblers already show noticeable differences in mtDNA sequence and calls, their songs do not differ; they are reproductively isolated only by allopatry and not usually considered separate species.Irwin et al. (2001) Ecology and evolution This is a common bird of mountain woodlands at altitudes of up to 3,500m ASL. It occurs from the Hindu Kush and Karakoram east and north to the Tien Shan in China and the Altay Mountains in Mongolia. The completely allopatric subspecies mandellii (Mandell's leaf warbler or eastern Hume's warbler) - sometimes separated as a full species, in which case the nominate subspecies is called western Hume's warbler - occurs on the eastern Tibetan Plateau.Alstr√∂m (2006) Both populations migrate over the Himalayas to winter in India and adjacent regions. The species has also been recorded in the Kutch region. Foraging in the understory in Kullu district, Himachal Pradesh (India) Particularly on autumn migration, this tiny warbler is prone to vagrancy as far as western Europe, despite a 3,000 km distance from its breeding grounds. It is a rare vagrant in late autumn and winter in Great Britain. Non-breeding adults may stray around a lot in summer, when Mandell's leaf warblers are fairly common summer visitors to subtropical and temperate montane humid forests of Bhutan, around 2,000-3,500 m ASL and dominated by Bhutan Fir (Abies densa) or by Himalayan Hemlock (Tsuga dumosa) and rhododendrons, though the subspecies is not a regular breeder in that country.Inskipp et al. (2000) This bird is not shy, although its arboreal lifestyle and cryptic colours make it difficult to observe. It is constantly in motion. Like most \\"Old World warblers\\", this small passerine is insectivorous. The nest is built on the ground. A common species in most of its wide range, Hume's leaf-warbler is not considered threatened by the IUCN.BLI (2008) It was recently split from the yellow-browed warbler (Phylloscopus inornatus), based on differences in morphology, bioacoustics, and molecular characters. The Western Hume's leaf warbler's range overlaps with that of the yellow-browed warbler in the western Sayan Mountains, but the species apparently do not hybridize. The divergence between the two species has been tentatively estimated at roughly 2.5 million years ago (mya), and that between P. h. humei and P. h. mandelli at about 1 mya.Alstr√∂m & Olsson (1988), Shirihai & Madge (1993), Ernst (1996), Irwin et al.

The land plants, or embryophytes, are thought to have emerged from the charophytes. Therefore, cladistically, embryophytes belong to green algae as well. However, because the embryophytes are traditionally classified as neither algae nor green algae, green algae are a paraphyletic group. Since the realization that the embryophytes emerged from within the green algae, some authors are starting to include them. The clade that includes both green algae and embryophytes is monophyletic and is referred to as the clade Viridiplantae and as the kingdom Plantae. The green algae include unicellular and colonial flagellates, most with two flagella per cell, as well as various colonial, coccoid and filamentous forms, and macroscopic, multicellular seaweeds. There are about 8,000 species of green algae. Many species live most of their lives as single cells, while other species form coenobia (colonies), long filaments, or highly differentiated macroscopic seaweeds. A few other organisms rely on green algae to conduct photosynthesis for them. The chloroplasts in dinoflagellates of the genus Lepidodinium, euglenids and chlorarachniophytes were acquired from ingested green algae,Plastid phylogenomics with broad taxon sampling further elucidates the distinct evolutionary origins and timing of secondary green plastids and in the latter retain a nucleomorph (vestigial nucleus). Green algae are also found symbiotically in the ciliate Paramecium, and in Hydra viridissima and in flatworms. Some species of green algae, particularly of genera Trebouxia of the class Trebouxiophyceae and Trentepohlia (class Ulvophyceae), can be found in symbiotic associations with fungi to form lichens. In general the fungal species that partner in lichens cannot live on their own, while the algal species is often found living in nature without the fungus. Trentepohlia is a filamentous green alga that can live independently on humid soil, rocks or tree bark or form the photosymbiont in lichens of the family Graphidaceae. Also the macroalga Prasiola calophylla (Trebouxiophyceae) is terrestrial, and Prasiola crispa, which live in the supralittoral zone, is terrestrial and can in the Antarctic form large carpets on humid soil, especially near bird colonies. Cellular structure Green algae have chloroplasts that contain chlorophyll a and b, giving them a bright green color, as well as the accessory pigments beta carotene (red-orange) and xanthophylls (yellow) in stacked thylakoids.Burrows 1991. Seaweeds of the British Isles. Volume 2 Natural History Museum, London. The cell walls of green algae usually contain cellulose, and they store carbohydrate in the form of starch. All green algae have mitochondria with flat cristae. When present, paired flagella are used to move the cell. They are anchored by a cross-shaped system of microtubules and fibrous strands. Flagella are only present in the motile male gametes of charophytes bryophytes, pteridophytes, cycads and Ginkgo, but are absent from the gametes of Pinophyta and flowering plants. Members of the class Chlorophyceae undergo closed mitosis in the most common form of cell division among the green algae, which occurs via a phycoplast. By contrast, charophyte green algae and land plants (embryophytes) undergo open mitosis without centrioles. Instead, a 'raft' of microtubules, the phragmoplast, is formed from the mitotic spindle and cell division involves the use of this phragmoplast in the production of a cell plate.P.H. Raven, R.F. Evert, S.E. Eichhorn (2005): Biology of Plants, 7th Edition, W.H. Freeman and Company Publishers, New York, Origins Photosynthetic eukaryotes originated following a primary endosymbiotic event, where a heterotrophic eukaryotic cell engulfed a photosynthetic cyanobacterium-like prokaryote that became stably integrated and eventually evolved into a membrane-bound organelle: the plastid. This primary endosymbiosis event gave rise to three autotrophic clades with primary plastids: the green plants, the red algae and the glaucophytes. Evolution and classification Ulva on rock substratum at the ocean shore. Some green seaweeds like Ulva are quick to utilize inorganic nutrients from land runoff, and thus can be indicators of nutrient pollution. Green algae are often classified with their embryophyte descendants in the green plant clade Viridiplantae (or Chlorobionta). Viridiplantae, together with red algae and glaucophyte algae, form the supergroup Primoplantae, also known as Archaeplastida or Plantae sensu lato. The ancestral green alga was a unicellular flagellate. The Viridiplantae diverged into two clades. The Chlorophyta include the early diverging prasinophyte lineages and the core Chlorophyta, which contain the majority of described species of green algae. The Streptophyta include charophytes and land plants. Below is a consensus reconstruction of green algal relationships, mainly based on molecular data. The basal character of the Mesostigmatophyceae, Chlorokybophyceae and spirotaenia are only more conventionally basal Streptophytes. The algae of this paraphyletic group \\"Charophyta\\" were previously included in Chlorophyta, so green algae and Chlorophyta in this definition were synonyms. As the green algae clades get further resolved, the embryophytes, which are a deep charophyte branch, are included in \\"algae\\", \\"green algae\\" and \\"Charophytes\\", or these terms are replaced by cladistic terminology such as Archaeplastida, Plantae, Viridiplantae or streptophytes, respectively. Reproduction Green algae conjugating Green algae are a group of photosynthetic, eukaryotic organisms that include species with haplobiontic and diplobiontic life cycles. The diplobiontic species, such as Ulva, follow a reproductive cycle called alternation of generations in which two multicellular forms, haploid and diploid, alternate, and these may or may not be isomorphic (having the same morphology). In haplobiontic species only the haploid generation, the gametophyte is multicellular. The fertilized egg cell, the diploid zygote, undergoes meiosis, giving rise to haploid cells which will become new gametophytes. The diplobiontic forms, which evolved from haplobiontic ancestors, have both a multicellular haploid generation and a multicellular diploid generation. Here the zygote divides repeatedly by mitosis and grows into a multicellular diploid sporophyte. The sporophyte produces haploid spores by meiosis that germinate to produce a multicellular gametophyte. All land plants have a diplobiontic common ancestor, and diplobiontic forms have also evolved independently within Ulvophyceae more than once (as has also occurred in the red and brown algae). Diplobiontic green algae include isomorphic and heteromorphic forms. In isomorphic algae, the morphology is identical in the haploid and diploid generations. In heteromorphic algae, the morphology and size are different in the gametophyte and sporophyte. Reproduction varies from fusion of identical cells (isogamy) to fertilization of a large non-motile cell by a smaller motile one (oogamy). However, these traits show some variation, most notably among the basal green algae called prasinophytes. Haploid algal cells (containing only one copy of their DNA) can fuse with other haploid cells to form diploid zygotes. When filamentous algae do this, they form bridges between cells, and leave empty cell walls behind that can be easily distinguished under the light microscope. This process is called conjugation and occurs for example in Spirogyra. =Sex pheromone= Sex pheromone production is likely a common feature of green algae, although only studied in detail in a few model organisms. Volvox is a genus of chlorophytes. Different species form spherical colonies of up to 50,000 cells. One well-studied species, Volvox carteri (2,000 ‚Äì 6,000 cells) occupies temporary pools of water that tend to dry out in the heat of late summer. As their environment dries out, asexual V. carteri quickly die. However, they are able to escape death by switching, shortly before drying is complete, to the sexual phase of their life cycle that leads to production of dormant desiccation-resistant zygotes. Sexual development is initiated by a glycoprotein pheromone (Hallmann et al., 1998). This pheromone is one of the most potent known biological effector molecules. It can trigger sexual development at concentrations as low as 10‚àí16M. Kirk and Kirk showed that sex- inducing pheromone production can be triggered experimentally in somatic cells by heat shock. Thus heat shock may be a condition that ordinarily triggers sex-inducing pheromone in nature. The Closterium peracerosum-strigosum- littorale (C. psl) complex is a unicellular, isogamous charophycean alga group that is the closest unicellular relative to land plants. Heterothallic strains of different mating type can conjugate to form zygospores. Sex pheromones termed protoplast-release inducing proteins (glycopolypeptides) produced by mating-type (-) and mating-type (+) cells facilitate this process. Physiology The green algae, including the characean algae, have served as model experimental organisms to understand the mechanisms of the ionic and water permeability of membranes, osmoregulation, turgor regulation, salt tolerance, cytoplasmic streaming, and the generation of action potentials.

He is known for the famous determinantal identities, known as Frobenius‚ÄìStickelberger formulae, governing elliptic functions, and for developing the theory of biquadratic forms. He was also the first to introduce the notion of rational approximations of functions (nowadays known as Pad√© approximants), and gave the first full proof for the Cayley-Hamilton theorem. He also lent his name to certain differential-geometric objects in modern mathematical physics, known as Frobenius manifolds. Biography Ferdinand Georg Frobenius was born on 26 October 1849 in Charlottenburg, a suburb of Berlin from parents Christian Ferdinand Frobenius, a Protestant parson, and Christine Elizabeth Friedrich. He entered the Joachimsthal Gymnasium in 1860 when he was nearly eleven. In 1867, after graduating, he went to the University of G√∂ttingen where he began his university studies but he only studied there for one semester before returning to Berlin, where he attended lectures by Kronecker, Kummer and Karl Weierstrass. He received his doctorate (awarded with distinction) in 1870 supervised by Weierstrass. His thesis, supervised by Weierstrass, was on the solution of differential equations. In 1874, after having taught at secondary school level first at the Joachimsthal Gymnasium then at the Sophienrealschule, he was appointed to the University of Berlin as an extraordinary professor of mathematics. Frobenius was only in Berlin a year before he went to Z√ºrich to take up an appointment as an ordinary professor at the Eidgen√∂ssische Polytechnikum. For seventeen years, between 1875 and 1892, Frobenius worked in Z√ºrich. It was there that he married, brought up his family, and did much important work in widely differing areas of mathematics. In the last days of December 1891 Kronecker died and, therefore, his chair in Berlin became vacant. Weierstrass, strongly believing that Frobenius was the right person to keep Berlin in the forefront of mathematics, used his considerable influence to have Frobenius appointed. In 1893 he returned to Berlin, where he was elected to the Prussian Academy of Sciences. Contributions to group theory Group theory was one of Frobenius' principal interests in the second half of his career. One of his first contributions was the proof of the Sylow theorems for abstract groups. Earlier proofs had been for permutation groups. His proof of the first Sylow theorem (on the existence of Sylow groups) is one of those frequently used today. * Frobenius also has proved the following fundamental theorem: If a positive integer n divides the order G of a finite group G, then the number of solutions of the equation xn = 1 in G is equal to kn for some positive integer k. He also posed the following problem: If, in the above theorem, k = 1, then the solutions of the equation xn = 1 in G form a subgroup. Many years ago this problem was solved for solvable groups. Only in 1991, after the classification of finite simple groups, this problem was solved in general. More important was his creation of the theory of group characters and group representations, which are fundamental tools for studying the structure of groups. This work led to the notion of Frobenius reciprocity and the definition of what are now called Frobenius groups. A group G is said to be a Frobenius group if there is a subgroup H < G such that :H\\\\cap H^x=\\\\\\\\{1\\\\\\\\} for all x\\\\in G-H. In that case, the set :N=G\\\\,-\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\bigcup_{x\\\\in G-H}\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!H^x together with the identity element of G forms a subgroup which is nilpotent as John G. Thompson showed in 1959. All known proofs of that theorem make use of characters. In his first paper about characters (1896), Frobenius constructed the character table of the group PSL(2,p) of order (1/2)(p3 ‚àí p) for all odd primes p (this group is simple provided p > 3). He also made fundamental contributions to the representation theory of the symmetric and alternating groups. Contributions to number theory Frobenius introduced a canonical way of turning primes into conjugacy classes in Galois groups over Q. Specifically, if K/Q is a finite Galois extension then to each (positive) prime p which does not ramify in K and to each prime ideal P lying over p in K there is a unique element g of Gal(K/Q) satisfying the condition g(x) = xp (mod P) for all integers x of K. Varying P over p changes g into a conjugate (and every conjugate of g occurs in this way), so the conjugacy class of g in the Galois group is canonically associated to p. This is called the Frobenius conjugacy class of p and any element of the conjugacy class is called a Frobenius element of p. If we take for K the mth cyclotomic field, whose Galois group over Q is the units modulo m (and thus is abelian, so conjugacy classes become elements), then for p not dividing m the Frobenius class in the Galois group is p mod m. From this point of view, the distribution of Frobenius conjugacy classes in Galois groups over Q (or, more generally, Galois groups over any number field) generalizes Dirichlet's classical result about primes in arithmetic progressions. The study of Galois groups of infinite-degree extensions of Q depends crucially on this construction of Frobenius elements, which provides in a sense a dense subset of elements which are accessible to detailed study.

All of their music has been released by the Washington, D.C. punk label Dischord except for their first LP. History As of 2005, Lungfish's lineup consisted of Daniel Higgs (vocals, occasional guitar), Asa Osborne (guitar), Sean Meadows (bass), and Mitchell Feldstein (drums). Two previous bass players were John Chriest and Nathan Bell. Style Lungfish blend rock with repetitive rhythms and repeated melodic motifs. Related projects Daniel Higgs sang in the 1980s hardcore/punk band Reptile House, and has released numerous solo works under his own name and also Cone of Light. He has recently made numerous solo performances, usually with the long-necked banjo and jaw harp (his recent albums document this as well: 2006's Ancestral Songs and 2007's Metempsychotic Melodies). In 2011, Higgs also collaborated with Swedish band Skull Defekts on the album Peer Amid (Thrill Jockey). Since 2015, Higgs has released two full-length albums in Fountainsun, a duo with Fumie Ishii. Asa Osborne has released a CD and 7\\" with Charles Brohawn of The Tinklers under the name Tear Jerks. Osborne also released an album on Dischord in 2002 with Daniel Higgs under the name The Pupils. In early 2008, the record label Holy Mountain announced a new solo project by Osborne called Zomes. Sean Meadows has played in numerous bands including June of 44, The Sonora Pine, and many lesser-known bands from the Chattanooga, Tennessee music scene. Mitchell Feldstein has published three volumes of prose/poetry: Hurl on Apathy Press, Teen Cardinal on Shattered Wig Press, and Even Change on Paradigm Publishing. He also played the drums with Arbouretum. In 2019 a cassette recording of Feldstein's spoken word with musical backdrops, \\"Pretty Boss\\" was released on Flag Day Recordings. Nathan Bell played bass on Kogumaza's K–æ–ª–æ–∫–æ–ª (2014), which featured the song \\"Ursids\\", which was used as a double-A-sided single with the band Hookworms. Bell has also worked with David Heumann from Arboureteum as Human Bell.

Most European birds remain in the breeding range year-round, but the eastern subspecies is partially migratory, with much of the population wintering further south. The male yellowhammer has a bright yellow head, streaked brown back, chestnut rump, and yellow under parts. Other plumages are duller versions of the same pattern. The yellowhammer is common in open areas with some shrubs or trees, and forms small flocks in winter. Its song has a rhythm like \\"A little bit of bread and no cheese\\". The song is very similar to that of its closest relative, the pine bunting, with which it interbreeds. Breeding commences mainly in April and May, with the female building a lined cup nest in a concealed location on or near the ground. The three to five eggs are patterned with a mesh of fine dark lines, giving rise to the old name for the bird of \\"scribble lark\\" or \\"writing lark\\". The female incubates the eggs for 12‚Äì14 days prior to hatching, and broods the altricial downy chicks until they fledge 11‚Äì13 days later. Both adults feed the chick in the nest and raise two or three broods each year. The nest may be raided by rodents or corvids, and the adults are hunted by birds of prey. Yellowhammers feed on the ground, usually in flocks outside the breeding season. Their diet is mainly seeds, supplemented by invertebrates in the breeding season. Changes to agricultural practices have led to population declines in western Europe, but its large numbers and huge range mean that the yellowhammer is classed as being of least concern by the International Union for Conservation of Nature. This conspicuous yellow bird has inspired poems by Robert Burns and John Clare, and its characteristic song has influenced musical works by Beethoven and Messiaen. Children's writer Enid Blyton helped to popularise the standard English representation of the song. Taxonomy The bird family Emberizidae contains around 300 seed-eating species, the majority of which are found in the Americas, although the genus Emberiza, with more than 40 members, is confined to the Old World. Within its genus, the yellowhammer is most closely related to the pine bunting, with which it forms a superspecies; they have at times been considered as one species. The white-capped and cirl buntings are also near relatives of the species pair. Where their ranges meet, the yellowhammer and pine bunting interbreed; the yellowhammer is dominant, and the hybrid zone is moving further east. The yellowhammer was described by Carl Linnaeus in his landmark 1758 10th edition of Systema Naturae under its current scientific name.Linnaeus (1758) p. 177. Emberiza is derived from the Old German Embritz, a bunting,Jobling (2010) p. 145. and citrinella is the Italian for a small yellow bird.Jobling (2010) p. 110. The English name is thought to have come from Ammer, another German word for a bunting, and was first recorded in 1553 as yelambre. =Subspecies= There are currently 3 recognised subspecies of yellowhammer: *E. c. citrinella (Linnaeus, 1758), the nominate subspecies, which occurs in southeast England and most of Europe east to the northwestern corner of Russia and western Ukraine. *E. c. caliginosa (Clancey, 1940) is the form found in Ireland, the Isle of Man, and Great Britain (except southeast England). *E. c. erythrogenys (Brehm, 1855) breeds from Russia, central Ukraine and the eastern Balkans eastwards to Siberia and northwest Mongolia, and also has isolated populations to the east of the Black Sea and in the Caucasus. Description Male E. c. caliginosa upright The yellowhammer is a large bunting, long, with a wingspan; it weighs . The male of the nominate subspecies E. c. citrinella has a bright yellow head, heavily streaked brown back, rufous rump, yellow under parts, and white outer tail feathers. The female is less brightly coloured, and more streaked on the crown, breast, and flanks. Both sexes are less strongly marked outside the breeding season, when the dark fringes on new feathers obscure the yellow plumage. The juvenile is much duller and less yellow than the adults, and often has a paler rump. After breeding, adults have a complete moult, which takes at least eight weeks; males acquire more yellow in the plumage each time they moult. Juveniles have a partial moult not long after fledging, replacing the head, body, and some covert feathers. Differences between the subspecies are small and geographically gradual. On average, the male of E. c. caliginosa is slightly smaller and darker than the same sex of the nominate subspecies, and also has more streaking on its back, a greenish tint to the yellow of the head and more chestnut on the flanks. The male of the eastern form, E. c. erythrogenys, is paler and less streaked than E. c. citrinella. Its flanks, undertail and wing bars are usually whiter, and its crown and throat are brighter yellow.Olsson et al. (1995) pp. 107‚Äì110. Distinguishing females of the three subspecies using plumage features is not usually possible.Olsson et al. (1995) p. 24. Females and juveniles, especially of the pale eastern subspecies, E. c. erythrogenys, may be confused with pine buntings, but they always have a yellow tint to their plumage, a paler rufous rump, and more uniform upperparts than that species.Olsson et al. (1995) pp. 111‚Äì114. Young and female yellowhammers can be distinguished from cirl buntings by the grey- brown rump of the latter species. Male hybrids with pine buntings are typically white-faced and have some yellow on the head, under parts or flight feathers, but females are usually indistinguishable from yellowhammers.Porter & Aspinall (2011) p. 208. =Voice= The song of the cock yellowhammer is a series of short notes, gradually increasing in volume and followed by one or two more protracted notes. It is often represented as \\"A little bit of bread and no cheese\\", and the full version can be confused with the almost identical song of the pine bunting. If the final notes are omitted, confusion with the cirl bunting is possible. Other vocalisations include a zit contact call, a see alarm, and a trilled tirrr given in flight. Yellowhammer males learn their songs from their fathers, and over time, regional dialects have developed, with minor differences to the conclusion of the basic song; all are mutually recognised by birds from different areas. Each male has an individual repertoire of song variants within its regional dialect; females tend to mate with males that share their dialect, and prefer those with the largest repertoires. The pine bunting and yellowhammer are so closely related that each responds to the other's song. The male yellowhammer's song is more attractive to females, and is one reason for the dominance of that species where the ranges overlap. Distribution and habitat thumb The yellowhammer breeds across the Palearctic between the July isotherms. It is the commonest and most widespread European bunting,Snow & Perrins (1998) pp. 1648‚Äì1651. although it is absent from high mountains, Arctic regions, the western Netherlands, most of Iberia and Greece, and low-lying regions of other countries adjoining the Mediterranean Sea. It breeds in Russia east to Irkutsk, and in most of Ukraine. The Asian range extends into northwest Turkey, the Caucasus, and northern Kazakhstan. Most European yellowhammers winter within their breeding range, only the far north being vacated, although some birds move south of their breeding range in Spain, Italy, and other Mediterranean countries. Distances travelled can be up to for northern birds. Asian birds are more strongly migratory, deserting much of the north to winter in Iraq, Iran, and southern Central Asia. The yellowhammer has occurred as a vagrant in the United Arab Emirates, Egypt, Kuwait, Morocco, Malta, the Himalayas (winter vagrant from northern Afghanistan to central NepalRasmussen (2005) p. 552.), the Balearic Islands, Iceland, and the Faroes. Yellowhammers of the British and Irish race, E. c. caliginosa, were introduced to New Zealand by local acclimatisation societies in 1862,Oliver (1955) p. 635. and soon spread over the main islands. They sometimes visit New Zealand's subantarctic islands, although rarely staying to breed, and have reached Australia's Lord Howe Island on a number of occasions. At the beginning of the 20th century, this bunting was seen as a serious agricultural pest in its adopted country.Lever (2005) p. 268. Populations of yellowhammer have also been introduced to the Falkland Islands and South Africa.Long, John L. (1981). Introduced Birds of the World. Agricultural Protection Board of Western Australia. pp. 21‚Äì493 The yellowhammer is a bird of dry, open country, preferably with a range of vegetation types and some trees from which to sing. It is absent from urban areas, forests, and wetlands. Probably originally found at forest edges and large clearing, it has benefited from traditional agriculture, which created extensive open areas with hedges and clumps of trees. Behaviour =Breeding= Eggs at the Mus√©um de Toulouse, France Breeding normally starts in early May, but often in April in the south of the range. Yellowhammers are monogamous and breed when aged one year. The males establish territories along hedges or woodland fringes and sing from a tree or bush, often continuing well into July or August. The male displays to the female by raising his wings and running towards her. The nest is built by the female on or near the ground, and is typically well hidden in tussocks, against a bank or low in a bush. It is constructed from nearby plant material, such as leaves, dry grass, and stalks, and is lined with fine grasses and sometimes animal hair. It is across with a cup deep. The clutch is usually three to five whitish eggs, typically patterned with a network of fine, dark lines. The eggs average in size and weigh , of which 6% is shell. The female incubates the eggs for 12‚Äì14 days to hatching, and broods the altricial, downy chicks until they fledge 11‚Äì13 days later. Both adults feed the chick in the nest and two or three broods are raised each year. The adult annual survival rate in the UK is around 54%, and that for juveniles in their first year is 53%. The typical lifespan is three years, although records from Great Britain and Germany indicate birds surviving more than 13 years. =Feeding= Foraging is mainly on the ground, and the bird's diet consists mainly of seeds. Oily seeds, such as those of brassicas, are ignored in favour of more starchy items. Typical food plants include common nettle, docks, common knotgrass, fat hen, common chickweed, and yarrow. Grasses are also important, particularly cereals, and grain makes up a significant part of the food consumed in autumn and winter, wheat and oats being preferred to barley. When not breeding, yellowhammers forage in flocks that can occasionally number hundreds of birds, and often contain other buntings and finches. The yellowhammer adds invertebrates to its diet in the breeding season, particularly as food for its growing chicks. A wide range of species is taken, including springtails, grasshoppers, flies, beetles, caterpillars, earthworms, spiders, and snails. During the first few days, chicks are exclusively fed invertebrate prey, but from day three they are also fed cereal grains, which the chicks can digest efficiently. This is thought to be intentional by the parents to allow the nestlings to adjust their physiology to eating seed. Predators and parasites The Eurasian sparrowhawk is a predator of the yellowhammer. Predators of the yellowhammer include the sparrowhawk,Jedrzejewska & Jedrzejewski (1998) p. 257. northern goshawk,Jedrzejewska & Jedrzejewski (1998) p. 250. lesser spotted eagle, and hobby.Jedrzejewska & Jedrzejewski (1998) p. 272.Jedrzejewska & Jedrzejewski (1998) p. 282. It is not a significant host of the common cuckoo, a brood parasite, although as a ground-nesting bird, its eggs and chicks are vulnerable to predation from small mammals such as mice and other rodents. Nests are also raided by crows, Eurasian jays, and Eurasian magpies. Predation accounted for more than 60% of nest failures in a 2012 survey in Germany. Thirteen species of fleas in the genera Ceratophyllus and Dasypsyllus have been found on this bunting, and internal parasites include Ascaridia galli.Atkinson et al. (2008) p. 401. The yellowhammer may carry haematozoan blood parasites such as Haemoproteus coatneyi. Males with high parasite levels produced fewer offspring (there is no such effect for females), and tend to be less brightly coloured. The striking plumage of the male may therefore have arisen as a signal of fitness to breed. Yellowhammers infected with Haemoproteus may have lower winter survival rates due to a tendency to having shorter wings. Status The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) estimates the European population of the yellowhammer to be from 54‚Äì93 million individuals, suggesting a Eurasian total of 73‚Äì186 million birds. Although the population appears to be in a decline, the decrease is not rapid enough to trigger their vulnerability criteria. The large numbers and huge breeding range of about 12.9 million km2 (5 million sq mi), mean that this bunting is classified by the IUCN as being of least concern. Populations have declined in recent decades in western Europe, including the British Isles, Belgium, the Netherlands, Austria, and Italy. The yellowhammer is a red-list (severely declining) species in Ireland and the UK. In eastern Europe, numbers appear to be stable, although the trend in Russia is unknown. Changes to agricultural practices are thought to be responsible for reduced breeding densities. The introduced population in New Zealand has been very successful, with breeding densities much higher than in the UK.Komdeur, Jan; Hammers, Martin \\"Failed introductions: finches from outside Australia\\" in Prins & Gordon (2014) p. 330. In culture John Clare wrote two poems about the yellowhammer. The yellowhammer is a conspicuous, vocal, and formerly common country bird, and has attracted human interest. Yellowham Wood and Yellowham Hill, near Dorchester, both derive their names from the bird. Robbie Burns' poem \\"The Yellow, Yellow Yorlin'\\" gets its title from a Scottish name for the yellowhammer, which is given an obvious sexual connotation: \\"I met a pretty maid, an' unto her I said,/ 'I wad fain fin' your yellow, yellow yorlin'.' \\"Cocker & Mabey (2005) pp. 460‚Äì461. More factual descriptions of the bird and its behaviour can be found in John Clare's \\"The Yellowhammer's Nest\\" and \\"The Yellowhammer\\", whose final lines read:Clare (1835) p. 79.Haughton et al. (1994) p. 139. > In early spring, when winds blow chilly cold, The yellowhammer, trailing > grass, will come To fix a place and choose an early home, With yellow breast > and head of solid gold. Enid Blyton helped to popularise the bird's song as \\"little bit of bread and no cheese\\" in books such as The Ship of Adventure and Five Go Off in a Caravan, and wrote a poem called \\"The Yellow-hammer\\".Blyton (2008) p. 164. Beethoven's student, Carl Czerny, and biographer Anton Schindler, both suggested that the composer got the idea for the first four notes of his 5th symphony from the yellowhammer's call, although more likely the opening of the 4th Piano Concerto was actually the work in question.Thayer (1991) p. 437. Beethoven also used the yellowhammer theme in two piano sonatas, no. 21 in C major (the \\"Waldstein\\", Op.53) and No. 23 in F minor (the \\"Appassionata\\", Op.57). Olivier Messiaen often used birdsong as an inspiration for his music, and the yellowhammer features in Chronochromie,Dingle & Fallon (2013) pp. 155‚Äì158. Catalogue d'oiseaux,Shenton (2008) pp. 61‚Äì63. La fauvette des jardins and M√©ditations sur le myst√®re de la Sainte Trinit√©,Bruhn (2008) p. 144.Dingle & Fallon (2013) pp. 170‚Äì171. appearing in four movements of the last piece. An old legend links the yellowhammer to the devil. Its tongue was supposed to bear a drop of his blood, and the intricate pattern on the eggs was said to carry a concealed, possibly evil, message; these satanic associations sometimes led to the persecution of the bird. The unusual appearance of the eggs also led to \\"scribble lark\\", an old name for the bird.

Often called a living fossil, the Amami rabbit is a living remnant of ancient rabbits that once lived on the Asian mainland, where they died out, remaining only on the two small Japanese islands where they live today.  Evolution  Pentalagus is thought to be a descendant of Pliopentalagus, known from the Pliocene of China and Eastern to Central Europe. Biology =Diet= The amami rabbit feeds on over 29 species of plants, which incorporates 17 species of shrubs and 12 species of herbaceous plants, consuming mostly the sprouts, young shoots and acorns. It also eats nuts and cambium of a wide variety of plant species. It is observed that the amami rabbit also feeds on the bark of stems and twigs of shrub plants. During summer, the amami rabbit primarily feeds on Japanese pampas grass, and during winter, they primarily eat the acorns of the pasania tree. =Morphology= The Amami rabbit has short feet and hind legs, a somewhat bulky body, and rather large and curved claws used for digging and sometimes climbing. Its ears are significantly smaller compared to those of other hares or rabbits. The pelage is thick, wooly and dark, brown on top and becomes more reddish-brown on the sides. It has heavy, long and very strong claws, being nearly straight on the forefeet and curved on the hindfeet The eyes are also small compared to more common rabbits and hares. The average weight is 2.5‚Äì2.8 kg. =Distribution and habitat= The ideal habitat for these rabbits is in an area between mature and young forests. They use the dense mature forests as protection and for the presence of pampas grass, in the summer, and acorns, in the winter, for their diets. They also use the high density of perennial grasses and herbaceous ground cover in the young forests for their diets during different times of the year. Therefore, the best habitat for them to live in is where they have easy access to both young and mature forests with no obstructions between the two forest types. Using fecal pellet counts and resident surveys, the number of rabbits is estimated at 2000‚Äì4800 left on Amami Island and 120‚Äì300 left on Tokuno Island. =Behavior= This species is a nocturnal forest-dweller that reproduces once in late March‚ÄìMay and once in September‚ÄìDecember, having one or two young each time. During the day, the mother digs a hole in the ground, for her young to hide in. At night, she opens the entrance to the hole, while watching for predators (such as venomous snakes), and then nurses her young, after which she closes the hole with soil and plant material by thumping on it with her front paws. Amami rabbits sleep during the day in hidden locations, such as caves. They are also noted for having a call similar to that of a pika. Endangered species =Threats= Before 1921, hunting and trapping were another cause of decline in population numbers. In 1921, Japan declared the Amami rabbit a \\"natural monument\\" which prevented it from being hunted. Then in 1963, it was changed to a \\"special natural monument\\" which prevented it from being trapped as well. Habitat destruction, such as forest clearing for commercial logging, agriculture space, and residential areas, is the most detrimental activity on the distribution of these rabbits. Since they prefer a habitat of both mature and young forests, they do not thrive in only mature forests untouched by destruction, yet they do not thrive in newly growing forests alone, either. There are plans to remove current habitat for these rabbits for the construction of golf courses and resorts, which is allowed because it will not directly be killing the rabbit, just changing the environment where it dwells, which is legal even under the protection of the special natural monument status. The Amami rabbit also faces huge threats from the invasive predators, being a major cause for the decline in population size. On the island of Amami, the small Indian mongoose (Herpestes javanicus) was released to control the population of a local venomous snake, and its numbers have increased dramatically. This mongoose, along with feral cats and dogs, are outpreying the Amami rabbit. Feral cats and small Indian Mongooses proved to be a threat to not only Amami rabbits but several other endangered endemic species in the area such the Amami jay. =Conservation= In July 2008, the Amami Rangers for nature conservation obtained a photograph of a feral cat carrying a rabbit corpse (rabbit bones and fur found in cat or dog droppings had already been found), prompting discussions on better ways to control pets. A small area of the Amami Island has the Amami Gunt≈ç National Park that further protects the population. Some attempt at habitat restoration has been made, but the Amami rabbit needs a mosaic of mature and young forest in close proximity, and when a young forest is regrown nowhere near a mature forest, this rabbit is not likely to inhabit it. Research and population monitoring also is underway to try to keep the numbers from declining, even if they can not be increased. Suggested conservation work for the future includes habitat restoration and predator population control. A healthy balance of mature and young forests still exists on the southern end of Amami, so that area should be protected. Restricting logging would also help to keep more forest available for the rabbits to live in by leaving more forest standing, as well as disturbing the surrounding environment more. An end to the building of forest roads used for logging and travel would further protect the Amami rabbit, as they cause population and habitat fragmentation, destroys their prime habitat and allows predators easier access to the middle of forests where a majority of the rabbit population exists. Controlling the populations of mongooses, feral dogs, and feral cats is another approach that could help bolster the rabbit population. Eradication of the mongooses and feral cats and dogs is needed, as well as better control of pets by local island residents. The Lagomorph Specialist Group of the International Union for the Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources proposed a plan of conservation in 1990. In Amami-Oshima Island, the Amami Wildlife Conservation Center of the Ministry of the Environment was established in 1999. It restarted a mongoose eradication program in 2005 and designated the Amami rabbit as endangered in 2004 for Japan.

Vreeland had one sister, Alexandra (1907‚Äì1999), who later married Sir Alexander Davenport Kinloch, 12th Baronet (1902‚Äì1982). Their daughter Emily Lucy Kinloch married Lt.-Col. Hon. Hugh Waldorf Astor (1920‚Äì1999), the second son of John Jacob Astor, 1st Baron Astor of Hever and Violet Astor, Baroness Astor of Hever. Vreeland's family emigrated to the United States at the outbreak of World War I, and moved to 15 East 77th Street in New York, where they became prominent figures in society. Vreeland was sent to dancing school as a pupil of Michel Fokine, the only Imperial Ballet master ever to leave Russia, and later of Louis Harvy Chalif.

The arrangement looks like the capital letter T, hence the name. The T-tail differs from the standard configuration in which the tailplane is mounted to the fuselage at the base of the fin. Advantages The tailplane is kept well out of the disturbed airflow behind the wing and fuselage, giving smoother and faster airflow over the elevators. This configuration may give more predictable design characteristics and better pitch control; but in the case of an aircraft with a tractor propeller, pitch control is reduced because the T-tail takes the control surfaces outside the propeller slipstream. Responsive pitch control is crucial for aircraft flying at low speed, to allow effective rotation on landing. This configuration also allows high performance aerodynamics and an excellent glide ratio as the empennage is less affected by wing and fuselage slipstream. A T-tail has a better effective aspect ratio (better lift slope), less interaction drag than a cruciform tail, and a more efficient vertical tail, the horizontal tail plate effectively increasing the aspect ratio of the fin by virtue of the 'end plate' effectHoerner and Borst, Fluid Dynamic Lift, Directional Characteristics, T-tail page 13-11, reducing turbulence and hence the induced drag of the fin. The rudder will also be more effective due to decreased induced drag. Therefore, the T-tail configuration is especially popular on gliders, where high performance is essential. A T tailed aircraft is easier to recover from a spin than aircraft with other types of empennage, as the elevator is located above the rudder, thus creating no dead air zone (\\"burble\\") above the elevator where the rudder would be ineffective in spin conditions.https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/19720005341.pdf Airborne and parachute operations off a T tailed cargo plane, such as Airbus A400M or Boeing C-17 Globemaster are safe, as there is no danger of the parachutists or dropped cargo hitting the empennage. Disadvantages The aircraft may be prone to suffering a dangerous deep stall condition, where a stalled wing at high angles of attack may blank the airflow over the tailplane and elevators, thereby leading to loss of pitch control. The American McDonnell F-101 Voodoo jet fighter suffered from this throughout its service life. The vertical stabilizer must be made considerably stronger and stiffer (and therefore heavier) to support the forces generated by the tailplane. The T-tail configuration can cause maintenance concerns. The control runs to the elevators are more complex, and elevator surfaces are much more difficult to casually inspect from the ground for all but the smallest aircraft. The loss of Alaska Airlines Flight 261 was directly attributed to lax maintenance of the T-tail. In order to mitigate some of these drawbacks, a compromise is also possible. The tailplane can be mounted part way up the fin rather than right at the top, known as a cruciform tail. The Sud Aviation Caravelle is an example of an aircraft with this configuration. Adoption The T-tail is very common on aircraft with engines mounted in nacelles on a high-winged aircraft or on aircraft with the engines mounted on the rear of the fuselage, as it keeps the tail clear of the jet exhaust. These layouts are often found in military transport aircraft - such as the Ilyushin Il-76, Airbus A400M and the Boeing C-17 Globemaster III - and regional airliners and business jets such as the Pilatus PC-12, Beechcraft Super King Air, Embraer ERJ, British Aerospace 146, and Learjet and Gulfstream families. It is rarely seen in combat aircraft, although the Gloster Javelin, McDonnell F-101 Voodoo, and Lockheed F-104 Starfighter interceptors all sported T-tails.

Like shawarma and tacos al pastor, it is derived from the lamb-based doner kebab. In Greece it is now most often pork or chicken, whilst beef, chicken, and lamb are common in other countries. It is typically served wrapped or stuffed in a pita, along with ingredients such as tomato, onion, and tzatziki sauce. History The earliest known photo of doner kebab (meat cooked on a vertical rotisserie) by James Robertson, 1855, Ottoman Empire Grilling a vertical spit of stacked meat slices and cutting it off as it cooks was developed in BursaKenneth F. Kiple, Kriemhild Cone√® Ornelas, eds., Cambridge World History of Food, Cambridge, 2000. . Vol. 2, p. 1147 in the 19th century Ottoman Empire, and called doner kebab (). Following World War II, doner kebab made with lamb was present in Athens, introduced by immigrants from Anatolia and the Middle East. A distinct Greek variation developed, often made with pork and served with tzatziki sauce, which later became known as gyros. By 1970, gyros wrapped sandwiches were already a popular fast food in Athens, as well as in Chicago and New York City. At that time, although vertical rotisseries were starting to be mass-produced in the US by Gyros Inc. of Chicago, the stacks of meat were still hand-made. According to Margaret Garlic, it was she who first came up with the idea to mass-produce gyros meat cones, after watching a demonstration by a Greek restaurant owner carving gyros on the What's My Line? television show. She convinced her husband John Garlic, a Jewish former Marine and then Cadillac salesman, of the idea. After obtaining a recipe from a Greek chef in Chicago, the couple rented a space in a sausage plant in Milwaukee and began operating the world's first assembly line producing gyros meat from beef and lamb trimmings, in the early 1970s. The Garlics later sold their business to Gyros Inc., which along with Central Gyros Wholesale, and Kronos Foods, Inc, also of Chicago, began large-scale production in the mid-1970s.

Some Greek restaurants in the US, such as the Syntagma Square in New York City‚Äîwhich can be seen briefly in the 1976 film Taxi Driver‚Äîcontinued to use both doner kebab and gyros to refer to the same dish, in the 1970s. In contrast to other areas of Greece, in Athens, the skewered meat dish souvlaki is known as kalamaki, while souvlaki is a term used generally for gyros, kalamaki, and similar dishes. The Greek pronunciation is , but the pronunciation in English is often or, occasionally or .\\"Jack in the Box rolls Greek gyro in 600 units\\", Nation's Restaurant News, December 21, 1992. article In Greek, \\"gyros\\" is a nominative singular noun, but the final 's' is often interpreted as an English plural, leading to the singular back-formation \\"gyro\\". Preparation In Greece, gyros is normally made with pork, though other meats are also used. Chicken is common, and lamb or beef may be found more rarely. Typical American mass-produced gyros are made with finely ground beef mixed with lamb. For hand-made gyros, meat is cut into approximately round, thin, flat slices, which are then stacked on a spit and seasoned. Fat trimmings are usually interspersed. Spices may include cumin, oregano, thyme, rosemary, and others. The pieces of meat, in the shape of an inverted cone, are placed on a tall vertical rotisserie, which turns slowly in front of a source of heat or broiler. As the cone cooks, lower parts are basted with the juices running off the upper parts. The outside of the meat is sliced vertically in thin, crisp shavings when done. The rate of roasting can be adjusted by varying the intensity of the heat, the distance between the heat and the meat, and the speed of spit rotation, thus allowing the cook to adjust for varying rates of consumption. In Greece it is customarily served in an oiled, lightly grilled piece of pita, rolled up with sliced tomatoes, chopped onions, lettuce, and french fries, topped with tzatziki sauce or, sometimes in northern Greece, ketchup or mustard.

In other words, non-monotonic logics are devised to capture and represent defeasible inferences (cf. defeasible reasoning), i.e., a kind of inference in which reasoners draw tentative conclusions, enabling reasoners to retract their conclusion(s) based on further evidence. Most studied formal logics have a monotonic consequence relation, meaning that adding a formula to a theory never produces a reduction of its set of consequences. Intuitively, monotonicity indicates that learning a new piece of knowledge cannot reduce the set of what is known. A monotonic logic cannot handle various reasoning tasks such as reasoning by default (consequences may be derived only because of lack of evidence of the contrary), abductive reasoning (consequences are only deduced as most likely explanations), some important approaches to reasoning about knowledge (the ignorance of a consequence must be retracted when the consequence becomes known), and similarly, belief revision (new knowledge may contradict old beliefs). Abductive reasoning Abductive reasoning is the process of deriving the most likely explanations of the known facts. An abductive logic should not be monotonic because the most likely explanations are not necessarily correct. For example, the most likely explanation for seeing wet grass is that it rained; however, this explanation has to be retracted when learning that the real cause of the grass being wet was a sprinkler. Since the old explanation (it rained) is retracted because of the addition of a piece of knowledge (a sprinkler was active), any logic that models explanations is non-monotonic. Reasoning about knowledge If a logic includes formulae that mean that something is not known, this logic should not be monotonic. Indeed, learning something that was previously not known leads to the removal of the formula specifying that this piece of knowledge is not known. This second change (a removal caused by an addition) violates the condition of monotonicity. A logic for reasoning about knowledge is the autoepistemic logic. Belief revision Belief revision is the process of changing beliefs to accommodate a new belief that might be inconsistent with the old ones. In the assumption that the new belief is correct, some of the old ones have to be retracted in order to maintain consistency. This retraction in response to an addition of a new belief makes any logic for belief revision to be non-monotonic. The belief revision approach is alternative to paraconsistent logics, which tolerate inconsistency rather than attempting to remove it. Proof-theoretic versus model-theoretic formalizations of non-monotonic logics Proof-theoretic formalization of a non-monotonic logic begins with adoption of certain non-monotonic rules of inference, and then prescribes contexts in which these non-monotonic rules may be applied in admissible deductions. This typically is accomplished by means of fixed-point equations that relate the sets of premises and the sets of their non-monotonic conclusions. Default logic and autoepistemic logic are the most common examples of non-monotonic logics that have been formalized that way.. Model-theoretic formalization of a non-monotonic logic begins with restriction of the semantics of a suitable monotonic logic to some special models, for instance, to minimal models, and then derives the set of non- monotonic rules of inference, possibly with some restrictions in which contexts these rules may be applied, so that the resulting deductive system is sound and complete with respect to the restricted semantics. Unlike some proof-theoretic formalizations that suffered from well-known paradoxes and were often hard to evaluate with respect of their consistency with the intuitions they were supposed to capture, model-theoretic formalizations were paradox-free and left little, if any, room for confusion about what non- monotonic patterns of reasoning they covered. Examples of proof-theoretic formalizations of non-monotonic reasoning, which revealed some undesirable or paradoxical properties or did not capture the desired intuitive comprehensions, that have been successfully (consistent with respective intuitive comprehensions and with no paradoxical properties, that is) formalized by model-theoretic means include first-order circumscription, closed-world assumption, and autoepistemic logic.

He was conceived by the series' creators Matt Groening and David X. Cohen, and is voiced by John DiMaggio. He fulfills a comic, antihero-type role in Futurama and is described by fellow character Leela as an \\"alcoholic, whore-mongering, chain- smoking gambler\\". According to the character's backstory, Bender was purpose built in Tijuana, Mexico (the other characters refer to his \\"swarthy Latin charm\\") a reference to bending in Mexican maquiladoras. Viewers are informed, through his own testimony, of Bender's prejudice against non-robots. For example, one of his signature expressions is \\"kill all humans\\". Exceptions who are not subject to Bender's prejudicial attitude are those individuals on his \\"Do Not Kill\\" list, which seems to comprise only his best friend Philip J. Fry and his colleague Hermes Conrad (added after the episode \\"Lethal Inspection\\"). However, Bender is also occasionally portrayed as possessing a sympathetic side, suggesting that he is not as belligerent as he claims, a view often echoed by his friends. Character biography Bender, a high-tech industrial metalworking robot, was built in 2996 at F√°brica Rob√≥tica De La Madre (Spanish: \\"Mom's Robot Factory\\"), a manufacturing facility of Mom's Friendly Robot Company in Tijuana, Mexico. However, the story of his construction remains a mystery. Although different creation processes have been shown, Cohen has stated that the viewer has only been shown Bender emerging from the machine that created him, while what happened inside the machine has not yet been revealed. According to one version, suggested by Hermes' flashback, and also by a reverse aging process shown in the episode \\"Teenage Mutant Leela's Hurdles\\", a newborn Bender possessed a baby-like body. In \\"Bendless Love\\", however, Bender is portrayed with a normal, adult-sized body in a flashback sequence conveying his memory of coming into existence. As Bender's memory contains an adult form, the episode's content suggests that the character might actually be recalling a transfer to an adult body, rather than the moment of creation. Unlike most other robots, Bender is mortal and, according to Professor Farnsworth's calculations, may have less than one billion years to live. Because of a manufacturing error that left Bender without a backup unit, Bender's memory cannot be transferred or uploaded to another robot body. After reporting that defect to his manufacturer, Bender barely escapes death from a guided missile and a robot death squad dispatched by Mom in order to eliminate him and effectively take the defective product off the market. At the factory, Bender was programmed for cold-bending structural steel. Bender later attended Bending State University, where he majored in bending and minored in Robo-American Studies. At the university, he was a member of Epsilon Rho Rho (ERR), a robot fraternity, where he became something of a fraternity hero for his many shenanigans: one night he chugged an entire keg of beer, streaked across campus, and stuffed 58 people into a telephone booth (although he concedes they were mostly children). Before meeting Fry and Leela and joining Planet Express (where he currently works as the assistant manager of sales), Bender had a job at the metalworking factory, bending steel girders for the construction of suicide booths. Bender has an apartment (00100100, the ASCII code for the dollar sign \\"$\\") in the \\"Robot Arms Apts.\\" building , where he eventually invites his best friend and coworker, Fry, to live with him. Although the pair enjoy living together, Bender is sometimes portrayed as manipulating his guileless friend. In the series' early episodes, Bender is shown preferring to occupy smaller areas of their apartment, like the closet, referring to them as \\"cozy\\", although in later episodes he is shown to have his own individual bedroom, like Fry. Throughout the series, he enters many romantic relationships of varying duration, and is commonly referred to as a womanizer by his friends. He does not seem to discriminate between human women and their robot or \\"fem-bot\\" counterparts, and is shown actively pursuing both. Likewise, his taste in fem-bot partners does not seem to be affected by the fem-bot's height or weight, and he is shown numerous times chasing fem- bots of all builds. In \\"Proposition Infinity\\", Bender's secret affair with coworker Amy Wong leads to a referendum that, once approved, legalizes robosexuality. In \\"The Bots and the Bees\\", he has a sexual encounter with a fem-bot soda vending machine that leads to the almost-instantaneous birth of a son, whom he names Ben, after the first part of his own name. Professor Farnsworth describes Bender to be constructed of an alloy of iron and osmium. Bender hates magnets, as magnets interfere with his inhibition unit, causing him to uncontrollably start singing folk songs when near his head; and also causing him to reveal his secret ambition to be a folk singer. He is once able to attach a magnetic small faux-beard underneath his mouth without breaking into song. Bender also has a near-pathological fear of electric can openers. Character =Creation= The name Bender was chosen by creator Matt Groening as an homage to John Bender (Judd Nelson), a character in The Breakfast Club. In that film, John Bender told Principal Vernon (Paul Gleason), \\"Eat my shorts,\\" an eventual catchphrase for another Groening creation, Bart Simpson. Bender's visual design went through multiple changes before reaching its final state. One of the decisions which Groening found to be particularly difficult was whether Bender's head should be square or round. Initially he worked under the idea that all robots would have square heads in the year 3000; however, it was later decided that Bender's head should be round, a visual play on the idea that Bender is a \\"round peg in a square hole\\". =Voice= John DiMaggio at the 2008 Electronic Entertainment Expo. When casting for Futurama, Bender's voice was the most difficult to cast, in part because the show's creators had not yet decided what robots should sound like. Because of this, every voice actor who auditioned, no matter for what role, was also asked to read for Bender. After about 300 auditions, even series co-creator Cohen attempted to audition after being told he sounded like a robot. John DiMaggio was eventually chosen for the role after his second audition. DiMaggio originally auditioned using his Bender voice for the role of Professor Farnsworth and used a voice later used for URL the police robot for Bender. He describes the voice he got the part with as a combination of a sloppy drunk, Slim Pickens, and a character one of his college friends created named \\"Charlie the sausage-lover\\". Casting directors liked that he made the character sound like a drunk, rather than an automaton. DiMaggio has noted that he had difficulty singing as Bender in \\"Hell Is Other Robots\\" because he was forced to sing the harmony part in a low key. Design Bender's factory- set height is 5 ft. 6 in. (1.68 m); 6 ft. (1.8 m) including his antenna. In \\"The Farnsworth Parabox\\", Bender states that he flipped a coin to decide his color, ending up with foghat gray rather than gold. In \\"The Cyber House Rules\\", Bender shows the kids a black-and-white mug shot of himself taken after his arrest for theft. In \\"Time Keeps on Slippin'\\", Bender is shown trying to join a basketball team and makes himself taller by simply extending his legs. His body has a \\"shiny metal ass\\", two legs, two \\"Extens-o-matic\\" arms with three fingers each, a head with two replaceable eyes shaped like light-emitting diodes, and a mouth used for fuel intake and voice communication. In \\"Bender Gets Made\\", Bender claims he also has a nose, but he chooses not to wear it. Bender's human-like characteristics are reinforced by his display of behaviors often regarded as exclusive to humans, such as whistling, snoring, having bloodshot eyes, crying, feeling physical attraction, being tickled, dreaming, and belching. Other bending units of the same model as Bender, such as Flexo, share the same hardware design, but differ in terms of their personality and behavior. For example, Flexo shows personality traits similar to those of Bender but is not quite as \\"evil\\" as Bender. In the episode \\"Mother's Day\\", Leela looks through a simulation of a bending unit's sight, which targets potential rubes and then denotes a plan to rob them and leave them in a ditch, implying that all bending robots are somewhat prone to theft and amoral by design. However, another unit, Billy West (named after the series voice actor of the same name), is helpful and kind, though he lives as a farmer on the Moon and insists on not being a bending unit. Bender's serial number, 2716057, can be expressed as the sum of two cubes, which is humorous to Bender and Flexo after Flexo reveals that his serial number (3370318) has the same characteristic (119^3 + 119^3) (also, Bender‚Äôs designation 1729 is a taxicab number). =Functions= Bender was designed specifically for the relatively simple task of bending straight metal girders into various angles. Despite this apparent simplicity, he possesses numerous features superfluous to his original purpose, which become more apparent after an electric jolt to his antenna from an overhead light socket in the pilot episode. The scope of Bender's functionality is impressive; he often acts as if he were a multifunctional gadget rather than a special bending machine. Similar to a contemporary computer, he hosts a number of input/output devices: his head has a data socket and remotely operated volume control. His body has a socket for a microphone jack, a dual-socket power receptacle, a reset button,Bender pushes a button on his body to erase everything he knows about cooking before his first cooking lesson in \\"The 30% Iron Chef\\". a kill switch, and a self-destruct button. Having the hardware- based self-destruct control on his body, rather than in his software, prevents Bender from committing suicide in \\"A Head in the Polls\\" when he pawns everything but his head, grows desperate without it and desires to kill himself. Bender is capable of disassembling and reassembling his body at will and operating each detached body part individually and remotely, presumably by using his transmitter and antenna to send wireless signals. His head can be used for a wide range of functions, whether attached to his body or not. In one episode, Leela reassembles Bender into a functioning go-kart (albeit in an event shown in the \\"What-If\\" machine). Bender uses his chest cavity as a locker, which seems to store much more than is physically possible; it is often used to store heads in jars, small children, alcohol, money, loot, the world's last darkroom, and, on a few occasions, Fry. In \\"The Route of All Evil\\", the cavity was also used as a boil kettle, hopback and fermentation tank to produce home-made beer. Upon inspection of his body, it appears to be empty, though devices like the F-Ray reveal that, despite appearing hollow, Bender's body contains gears and other robotic components. Being an electronic machine, he can perform quick mathematical calculations, but admits to being a poor calculator. =Build= As a bending unit, Bender possesses extraordinary strength, which he often demonstrates by lifting heavy objects, smashing through walls, and even bending an enormous steel girder marked \\"UNBENDABLE\\" (in \\"Bendless Love\\"). His mechanical nature also makes him far more durable than the rest of the cast, capable of surviving gunfire, explosions, extreme heat, deep water, or hard vacuum. Even when his body is seemingly destroyed or completely detached from his head, it has no effect on Bender's ability to think and communicate, indicating that his main processing facilities are located in his head.Indirect evidence suggesting that the Bender's computer is in fact located in his head is provided in several episodes. In \\"Fry and the Slurm Factory\\" the F-ray exam shows that Bender's head contains a device clearly marked \\"6502\\" (a designation for MOS Technology 6502, an eight-bit microprocessor used in the original Apple Computer). In \\"Roswell that Ends Well\\", Fry's grandfather reaches deep inside Bender's head and retrieves a handful of circuit boards and microchips, to which Bender protests by exclaiming, \\"Hey, that's my brain!\\". Bender's hardware is controlled by a factory-loaded operating system, which reboots upon incidental shutdown and automatically adjusts its settings to the environment detected at the time of rebooting. For example, in \\"The Birdbot of Ice-Catraz\\", when Bender reboots, his visual sensors detect a colony of penguins, prompting his boot loader to re-initialize him with penguin-like behavior and language. He is equipped with a vast capacity of computer data storage, in excess of 100,001 terabytes- 1 TB for general storage and 100,000 TB for the storage of pornography, though in \\"Overclockwise\\" Cubert Farnsworth deletes 12 TB of outdated catchphrases from Bender. Presumably either Bender has a separate \\"catchphrase drive\\" or the majority of the catchphrases are also pornographic.In Season 7, Episode 17 \\"Forty Percent Leadbelly\\", it is shown that Bender has a 1 terabyte \\"Main Drive\\", and a 100,000 terabyte \\"Porn Drive\\". =Source of energy= Bender is powered by alcohol-based fuels, which he can convert into an electrical power source sufficient to operate not only himself, but also small household appliances plugged into his power receptacle.In the episode \\"Bender Should Not Be Allowed on TV\\", Bender serves as a power supply for a small television set, which is plugged into a receptacle located on the underside of Bender's body. Low alcohol intake levels decrease his production of electricity: when he stops drinking and begins to \\"sober\\", his behavior grows increasingly ebrious and dysfunctional, and he grows a red beard of rust. He is also, apparently, able to sustain himself by consuming mineral oil, though he considers this to be only 'functional'. Due to Professor Farnsworth's flawed design, the energy conversion process inside Bender's body produces an inordinate amount of waste gases and heat. He can expel these products from his rear end or, more often, as a flaming belch. He also has a nuclear pile inside his body, as seen in \\"Godfellas\\". However, its location and purpose are not clear. Personality Bender often exhibits sociopathic behavior; he is a pathological liar and rarely shows any empathy (his most frequent catchphrase to any bothersome person is \\"Bite my shiny metal ass!\\"). He has a mostly voluntary morality and constantly steals, ranging from the petty theft of wallets to crimes such as kidnapping Jay Leno's head and stealing Fry's blood and kidney. He also once stole Amy's earrings while giving her a hug. It was shown in \\"Roswell That Ends Well\\" that even in a disassembled state, his individual limbs carry on attempting to steal anything in proximity; the hand on his dismembered arm steals a wallet out of a scientist's pocket before becoming inactive again. He is shown throughout the series as having a secret desire to be a folk musician that only manifests itself when a magnet is placed on or near his head. This desire is finally fulfilled in the episode \\"Bendin' in the Wind\\": an accident involving a giant can opener leaves him with a mutilated chest and paralyzed from the neck down. An encounter with Beck during his hospitalization leads to his becoming lead washboard player and the two teaming up for a musical tour that turns Bender into a folk hero for other broken robots, only for his career to end when he finally recovers. Bender's graffiti in Budapest, Pestszentl≈ërinc district He is also fascinated with cooking, being the chef of the Planet Express Ship, though he is shown to have no sense of actual taste. In fact, his early dinners were so horrible that even the omnivorous Zoidberg could not eat it. In his first attempt, he creates a dinner for the crew that is so over-salted they all gag (which is aggravated further when their drinks turn out to be \\"salt with water in them\\"); he then remarks that the food was fine since the salt content was 10% below a lethal dose (unfortunately, Zoidberg had seconds). In \\"The Problem with Popplers\\", he creates dinner consisting of nothing but capers and baking soda, and mistakenly expresses his belief that humans eat rocks. He seems to improve his cooking skills over the series, cooking a lavish cake for Nibbler's birthday party and beating Elzar for the title of Iron Cook (though he uses a potion called \\"The Essence of Pure Flavor\\", which consists of water and a generous portion of LSD to make the judges hallucinate that his food tastes good). In Into the Wild Green Yonder, he mistakenly bakes prison guards a cake with nutmeg thinking it was a natural human sleep drug, before being corrected by Amy that nutmeg is in fact a baking ingredient. As a robot, he possesses an incredible amount of patience. In \\"Roswell That Ends Well\\", he is shown to wait over a thousand years in sand after his head is lost during a trip back in time to 1947, as well as many thousands of years in caverns under New New York City (although on this occasion he was also in the presence of multiple alternate versions of himself that had previously made the same 'trip'). Despite the long wait, it is implied that Bender does not power down, apparently enjoying his own company so much that he does not consider it necessary. However, in one episode, he shows next to no patience as a one-time joke. Although the consumption of alcohol is necessitated by Bender's design and should not be generally viewed as a vice for alcohol-fueled robots, he apparently drinks far more than he needs for energy. His excessive drinking contributes to his characterization as an alcoholic (\\"Hell Is Other Robots\\" reveals that robots can function equally well on mineral oil instead of alcohol, also contributing to the perception of Bender's alcohol use as a vice). If he is deprived of alcohol, for instance during periods of depression, he ceases to function properly and shows signs similar to human drunkenness, including developing a rusty five o'clock shadow. As noted above, his disembodied head has survived for millennia with, presumably, no source of alcohol, so it may be that, when a mere head, Bender neither requires alcohol nor suffers from its absence. When he is sufficiently frightened or sickened, bricks fall from his backside (a reference to the slang \\"shitting bricks\\"). When sufficiently fascinated by something, he may pull out a camera and snap a picture, adding the catchphrase \\"Neat!\\". He has also been shown to be able to use his eyes as cameras. In addition to drinking, he also has an affinity for cigars, which he ignites with a lighter built into his finger, although in \\"Decision 3012\\" he uses a Zippo. Unlike drinking alcohol for fuel, Bender tells Fry that he smokes cigars simply because they \\"make [him] look cool\\". Despite being a robot, he has been seen to show emotion on many occasions, even shedding a tear in \\"Crimes of the Hot\\". One of the series' running jokes revolves around Bender having emotions, when technically he should be an unfeeling machine. Bender is seemingly unaware of his emotions, stating in the episode \\"Anthology of Interest II\\", \\"I mean, being a robot's great, but we don't have emotions, and sometimes that makes me very sad\\". In his very first appearance, he tries to commit suicide via a suicide booth out of guilt for having unknowingly contributed to their creation. He has also been known to be nonchalant to the point of appearing both uncaring and incredibly brave, even in life- threatening situations. Bender is a classic narcissist. He considers himself flawless, a \\"towering inferno of physical perfection\\", and refers to himself in both the first and third person. In \\"The Farnsworth Parabox\\" Bender seemingly falls in love with an alternate gold-plated version of himself, stating that he has finally found someone \\"as great as me\\". Even his personal email address, bender@ilovebender.com, reflects his self-absorption. Despite these human characteristics, he has no verifiable soul, as seen in \\"Obsoletely Fabulous\\" when he passes through a \\"soul detector\\" without setting off the alarm. However, in \\"Ghost in the Machines\\", Bender becomes a ghost who can't interact with people directly but can possess machinery: he uses this ability to \\"scare Fry to death\\". He eventually makes a deal with the Robot Devil (Dan Castellaneta) to get a new body. His relationships with the rest of the crew of Planet Express vary over time, although he treats nearly all biological organisms with disdain. The only one of his friends who he has openly shown affection for is Fry, his best friend and roommate. \\"Of all the friends I've had, [he is] the first.\\" Although he is verbally and physically abusive towards Fry and considers him to be vastly inferior to him, he has been shown to care for him a great deal. In \\"Jurassic Bark\\" he states that he loves Fry \\"the way a human loves a dog, or the way a gorilla loves a kitty\\", and in \\"I Second That Emotion\\" when Bender gets jealous of Leela‚Äôs pet Nibbler and flushes him down the toilet, a distraught Leela asks how he would feel if she did the same to Fry, describing Fry as Bender's pet (Bender responds with an apathetic \\"Only one way to find out.\\"). He routinely takes advantage of his friends, including framing them for crimes, robbing them, stealing Fry's blood on more than one occasion, stealing Fry's power of attorney, using Fry's body to smash open a window, taking Fry's kidney and trying to sell it (it eventually gets eaten by Leela), and stealing jewelry from Amy. He is prone to using the ship‚Äôs doctor, Zoidberg, in various get-rich-quick schemes, although it is probable he does not consider Dr. Zoidberg a friend, since in \\"Obsoletely Fabulous\\" Bender begged the 1X Robot to \\"save (his) friends, and Zoidberg\\" (Though it is seen that he helps Zoidberg from time to time, as seen in \\"That's Lobstertainment!\\"). He even betrays Leela to Zapp Brannigan in Into the Wild Green Yonder when she becomes a wanted criminal, out of jealousy of her steadily growing rap sheet, only to break her out of prison again to ensure his own sheet remains lengthier. Although he regularly frustrates the crew, they have demonstrated a certain affection for him in return. During \\"How Hermes Requisitioned His Groove Back\\", the entire crew travels to the Central Bureaucracy to recover Bender‚Äôs brain after Morgan Proctor burned it onto a floppy disk and sent it away. Hermes Conrad (Phil LaMarr) subsequently risks his bureaucratic license to locate the disc with Bender's brain on it by sorting the entire pile in just under four minutes. In the same episode, when Amy asked why they had to fix him, after being met with a brief period of uncertain silence, Leela says, \\"Those arguments aside, we're still going.\\" Amy and Bender date for a time in \\"Proposition Infinity\\"; the relationship becomes so serious that Bender proposes to Amy and participates in a campaign to legalize human/robot marriage, although the relationship ends after he realizes that such marriage rights would necessitate monogamy. Despite his often immoral attitude, he does not lack a softer side; he can feel guilt and remorse over his actions if he goes too far (even by his own standards), indicating that he is not as selfish or unkind as he appears to be. In \\"Bendless Love\\", Bender intends to murder Flexo in order to win the love of fem-bot Angelyne, but when Flexo gets stuck under a gigantic steel girder, Angelyne shows sorrow for him. Bender decides that her happiness is more important than his own, and ends up saving Flexo. Also, in \\"Jurassic Bark\\", when Bender becomes jealous of Fry's petrified dog, Seymour, he decides to throw him in magma. But when he realizes how his actions hurt Fry, Bender apologizes for his behavior and rescues the dog. In \\"Godfellas\\", he becomes the god of a microscopic alien race and abuses this position by commanding them to produce beer for him. When his abuse of power causes the entire species' demise, however, he cries in mourning and remorse. Reception and cultural influence In 2008, Bender took second place behind the Terminator in a poll for the \\"Baddest Movie Robot\\" on Techradar.com. The song \\"Bend It Like Bender!\\" from the Devin Townsend Project album Addicted, is a direct reference to Bender and contains the quote \\"Game's over, losers! I have all the money!\\" =Appearances in other media= Being the show's breakout character, Bender has made several cameos in different episodes of The Simpsons, another series by Matt Groening. Within The Simpsons, Bender has appeared in episodes \\"Future-Drama\\", \\"Bart vs. Lisa vs. the Third Grade\\", \\"Missionary: Impossible\\" and \\"Replaceable You\\". Bender also makes a cameo appearance in Matt Groening's latest series Disenchantment, in the episode \\"Dreamland Falls\\". In the Simpsons-Futurama crossover episode \\"Simpsorama\\", Bender travels back in time in the 21st century to Springfield to kill Homer Simpson, whose DNA is tied to the creatures rampaging in the 31st century. Bender ends up befriending Homer before learning that the creatures are in fact Bart's genetic offspring. Once the crisis is averted, Bender goes into shutdown mode in the Simpsons' basement. Bender was still resting inert in the Simpsons' basement as of 2015 episode \\"Cue Detective\\" in which his empty body cavity was used to store the family's cash nest-egg. Bender also makes a background cameo appearance in the Simpsons episode \\"My Fare Lady\\", holding a shovel and bucket at the end of Homer's dream about The Jetsons. Bender, along with Professor Farnsworth and Fry, appear in the season finale of Disenchantment as a hologram from a crystal ball, within the one-way time machine from the Futurama episode \\"The Late Philip J. Fry\\". He also appears as one of the enemies, along with Doctor Zoidberg, in The Simpsons Game. Bender makes cameo appearances in several Family Guy episodes. In \\"Blue Harvest\\" he can be seen at the Mos Eisley cantina, and in \\"The Splendid Source\\", he is one of the repeaters of a dirty joke whose original author Peter Griffin, Joe Swanson, and Glenn Quagmire are seeking. In the episode \\"Boopa-dee Bappa-dee\\", Peter attempts to use the guide on the television remote, turning Stewie Griffin into a host of past and present Animation Domination characters, including Bender. In \\"Throw it Away\\", Lois Griffin drags Stewies Time Machine down the stairs which takes them to, in order, the 1950s, the 18th century, the future, with Chris Griffin replaced by Bender.

The resulting resin can then be injection molded into plastics goods, extruded for film applications, thermoformed into packaging, or extruded for use in textiles applications. PLA is more resistant to ultraviolet light than most other synthetics. It has relatively low flammability and smoke generation. Because it is more hydrophilic than common polyester fibers, when blended with cotton and wool, the biopolymer results in lighter garments that wick moisture away from the skin. The biopolymer is also used in packaging manufacturing, including bottles for mineral water, that can be found already on the market (e.g. in Italyhttps://www.natureworksllc.com/News-and-Events/Press- Releases/2009/02-23-09-Responsible-Launch).

Kretzschmar, Jr., The Routledge Dictionary of Pronunciation for Current English on the River Medway, north of Royal Tunbridge Wells, south west of Maidstone and south east of London. In the administrative borough of Tonbridge and Malling, it had an estimated population of 41,293 in 2018. History The town was recorded in the Domesday Book 1087 as Tonebrige,Open Domesday: Tonbridge. Retrieved 12 September 2020. which may indicate a bridge belonging to the estate or manor (from the Old English tun), or alternatively a bridge belonging to Tunna, a common Anglo-Saxon man's name. Another theory suggests that the name is a contraction of \\"town of bridges\\", due to the large number of streams the High Street originally crossed. Until 1870, the town's name was spelt Tunbridge, as shown on old maps including the 1871 Ordnance Survey map and contemporary issues of the Bradshaw railway guide. In 1870, this was changed to Tonbridge by the GPO due to confusion with nearby Tunbridge Wells, despite Tonbridge being a much older settlement. Tunbridge Wells has always maintained the same spelling. =Normans and Tonbridge Castle= The motte of Tonbridge Castle Tonbridge Castle gatehouse Tonbridge stands on a spur of higher land where the marshy River Medway could be more easily forded. Ancient trackways converged at this point . There is no record of any bridge before 1191. For much of its existence, the town remained to the north of the river, since the land to the south was subject to extensive seasonal flooding. One part of the town is called 'Dryhill'. Richard Fitz Gilbert de Clare founded the Priory of St Mary Magdalene in 1124. A castle was built here in the 11th century by Richard Fitz Gilbert, son of the murdered guardian of William the Conqueror in his infancy. Richard was responsible for governing England in William I's many absences. The town was besieged by William Rufus, soon after his accession to the throne, because the Earl had pledged allegiance to William's brother, Robert. The arrow, which killed William Rufus a few years later, was shot by Walter Tirel who was born in Tonbridge as well as being Richard Fitz Gilbert's son-in-law. =Medieval= The town was soon afterwards taken again, this time by King John only a few months after the signing of the Magna Carta. Both the Earl and his son were signatories and guardians of the document responsible for its compliance. It was subsequently besieged by Prince Edward, son of Henry III. On this occasion the besieged garrison burnt the town rather than see it fall. The town and Tonbridge Castle were rebuilt after this and in the 13th century became an official residence and records repository of Edward II. In later medieval times, Tonbridge was considered an important strategic settlement. Some evidence shows Henry III intended it to be a walled town, and a charter was issued allowing for walls to be built, a market to be held, court sessions to be held and two members from the town to attend parliament. The walls were never built, perhaps because the castle's large outer bailey could have easily accommodated the townspeople in times of strife. A surrounding bank and ditch known as The Fosse was erected. Today only traces of this encircling defence now remain. The historic core of the town still contains a large number of working buildings dating from the 15th century: the oldest is Port Reeves in East Street. Tonbridge School, the famous public school, was established in 1552 under letters patent of Edward VI, to educate the sons of local gentry and farmers (There was already a nearby school in existence for poorer boys, now Sevenoaks School.) During Queen Mary's reign Tonbridge was involved in an unsuccessful uprising against the Queen's marriage to the King of Spain, with 500 townspeople involved in the Battle of Hartley in 1554. As a result, the town was chosen for a place of execution of a number of Protestants; and in 1555 James Tutty and Margery Polley were burned at the stake in the town and Joan Beach met the same fate in 1556 at Rochester. A memorial to Margery Polly is on the green at Pembury. =17th and 18th centuries= During the Civil War, the town was garrisoned by the Parliamentarian side who refortified the castle. Royalist sympathisers made several attempts to take the town but were repulsed. The Wharf on the Medway Navigation, downstream of the Big Bridge. In 1740 an Act of Parliament was passed to make the River Medway navigable to Tonbridge by the Medway Navigation Company, allowing such materials as coal and lime to be transported to the town, and gunpowder, hops and timber to be carried downriver to Maidstone and the Thames. For a hundred years the Medway Navigation Company was highly profitable, paying out good dividends to its investors, but after the arrival of the railway in 1842 the company went into a steep decline and all commercial traffic ceased in 1911 when the company collapsed. Some of the original warehouses and the wharves are still recognisable today, downstream of the town's main bridge. Later, the town and its surroundings became famous for the production of finely inlaid wooden cabinets, boxes and other objects called Tunbridgeware, which were sold to tourists who were taking the waters at the nearby springs at Tunbridge Wells. Another speciality in the town was until recently the production of cricket balls (the original cricket ball factory in Preston Road was demolished in 2012 to make way for housing)visual and other sports goods. The Corn Exchange in Bank Street, which was originally conceived as a chapel, dates from 1790. =19th century to present= A map of Tonbridge from 1946 During the March 1880 parliamentary election, Tonbridge was the scene of a riot. On the announcement of the results, several thousand people started to hurl stones and cobbles at each other in the High Street near the Rose and Crown Hotel. The county's Chief Constable Captain Ruskin, with over a hundred policemen, charged the crowds many times during the evening, only to end up as the target of the crowd, who started hurling stones and cobbles at them instead of each other. Many people, including twelve policemen, were seriously injured before the crowd finally dispersed at midnight. The United Kingdom's first speeding fine was handed out by Tonbridge Petty Sessions court in 1896. The guilty driver was a Mr Walter Arnold of East Peckham, who was fined one shilling for speeding at in a zone in Paddock Wood, in his Karl Benz powered car. Mr Arnold was apprehended by a policeman who had given chase on his bicycle. During World War II a prisoner of war camp was built at the junction of Tudeley Lane and Pembury Road on land belonging to Somerhill House. It held German pilots who had been shot down, and captured Italian soldiers. After the war the camp was used as temporary housing for people made homeless by the Blitz. The site is now occupied by the Weald of Kent Girls' Grammar School. Ruth Ellis, the last woman in the United Kingdom to be hanged, was married at the registry office in Tonbridge on 8 November 1950. =Securitas depot robbery= Tonbridge was the location of the largest cash theft in British criminal history. On 22 February 2006, over ¬£53.1 million was stolen from the Securitas cash-handling depot in Vale Road to the east of the High Street. During the following police investigation, around half of the money was recovered. On 28 January 2008 five people were convicted at the Old Bailey. Governance Tonbridge is in the county of Kent. After the Norman Conquest Richard Fitz Gilbert acquired Tonbridge and the surrounding area, this district being known as the Lowy of Tunbridge. The lowy covered the approximate area of the later parishes of Tonbridge, Tonbridge Rural, Southborough, Hildenborough and Hadlow. The separate administration of the lowy continued until at least the 14th century, after which it became regarded in a similar way to the other hundreds of the county. In the 1894 local government reforms Tonbridge and Southborough became urban districts and the rest of the area became part of Tonbridge Rural District. Since 1974 the town has been part of the local government district of Tonbridge and Malling, and is divided into the seven local government wards of Cage Green, Castle, Higham, Judd, Medway, Trench and Vauxhall. These wards have 16 of the 54 seats on the Tonbridge and Malling Borough Council. As of May 2019, 11 of these seats were held by the Conservative Party, two by the Liberal Democrats and two by the Green Party. Tonbridge and Malling Borough Council is responsible for running local services, such as recreation, refuse collection and council housing; while Kent County Council is responsible for education, social services and trading standards. Both councils are involved in town planning and road maintenance. Tonbridge is in the parliamentary constituency of Tonbridge and Malling, currently represented in Parliament by Thomas Tugendhat of The Conservative Party. Economy The Oast Theatre Major industries include light engineering, printing and publishing, distribution and financial services. Tonbridge, together with its neighbour Tunbridge Wells, has been designated by the South East Assembly as a Regional Hub. The town has largely retained its 'market town' atmosphere and has many attractions to visitors and residents alike, including the well-maintained Castle Gatehouse, a large country park and activities based around the river. Sports facilities including an indoor/outdoor swimming pool, a leisure centre and a large sports ground are all located close to the town centre. Many of the facilities are provided or subsidised by the local authority. Most of the town's shopping facilities are concentrated on the High Street, which runs for about through the town centre. There has been increasing criticism from local residents that there is a relative abundance of restaurants, estate agents, banks and 'cheap' shops, and a lack of major high street retailers. However, there are far fewer empty high street premises than in the mid-1990s, reflecting the town's increasing prosperity. The town traders suffer from its proximity to large shopping centres such as Tunbridge Wells, Maidstone and Bluewater. The Borough Council has published proposals to improve the town's shopping and leisure facilities. During the early 20th century Tonbridge became the South East hub for plastic moulding / engineering and printing, with many well-known companies such as The Crystalate Gramophone Record Company, which claimed to be the oldest record producer in Britain. They bought out The Vocalion Gramophone Company in 1932 when the principal labels included Rex, Nine-Inch Broadcast, and Ten-Inch Broadcast. From the early post-war years, Crystalate was very much involved in producing the 1 mini-disc, which was sold in Marks & Spencers, Woolworths and probably other stores for 6d (2.5p) each between 1930 and 1937, with labels such as Crown, Embassy and Eclipse. In 1937, Crystalate was absorbed by Decca, which was itself purchased by Polygram (Philips). Some manufacturing still remains in Tonbridge: Enalon Limited, founded in 1946, is the last remaining plastic moulder and toolmaker based in the town. The River Centre In 1999, Harvester Trust Tonbridge bought a derelict site on Medway Wharf Road, in the centre of Tonbridge. A ¬£4 million building which can be used as a church, community centre and conference centre was given planning permission in March 2000. Work began in 2001. The River Centre was officially opened in January 2003, and hosts a wide variety of events from product launches to awards ceremonies, as well as international church conferences. In August 2016, Hillsong Church purchased the building and is the current owner. The police station, on Pembury Road, was previously the headquarters of the West Kent Police Division, prior to the West Division being again headquartered at Maidstone. Royal Mail's TN postcode main sorting office is located on Vale Road in the town. Tonbridge is also the location of Carroty Wood, an outdoor activity and residential centre run by Rock UK, offering groups of young people the opportunity to try out a variety of outdoor activities. A former oast house on the road to Hildenborough has been converted to a small theatre called the Oast Theatre. Tonbridge Medical Group built a substantial new medical centre in 2020 to replace their ageing Pembury Road and Higham Lane sites. Transport The South Eastern Main Line crossing the River Medway upstream of the Sports Ground Tonbridge railway station is one of Kent's busiest with 4.1 million passengers using it each year. It is an important railway junction with lines to London, Ashford, Hastings and Redhill. The town is also served by the A21 trunk road between London and Hastings and the A26 between Maidstone and Brighton. It is also close to the M25 motorway. Tonbridge is served by numerous bus routes, most of which are run by Arriva Southern Counties. Dualing of the A21 from Castle Hill to Pembury, where a new regional hospital opened in 2011, has now been completed and opened in 2018. Before World War I, aviation pioneers Frank Gooden and Richard Johnson tried to establish an airfield to the north of Tonbridge at Cage Green Fields, at the top of the ridge which The Ridgeway ascends, and east of Shipbourne Road. An accident is recorded as having occurred on 24 December 1913 at the airfield, although neither Gooden or Johnson was injured. The scheme was ended by the outbreak of war. Education Tonbridge School, founded in 1553 by Sir Andrew Judde, is a major independent school for boys, which is in the centre of the town. Around 60% of the boys there are boarders, and live in the school's houses, which are all close to the school. The town is also home to several Grammar Schools, including The Judd School, Weald of Kent Grammar School and Tonbridge Grammar School for Girls. A number of Tonbridge's secondary schools have specialist status, including Tonbridge Grammar School for Maths and ICT, as well as Languages; Weald of Kent Grammar School for Girls, a specialist school for languages and science; the Judd School for Music with English and also now Science with Maths; Hayesbrook School for boys, a specialist sports college; and Hillview School For Girls, with Performing Arts Status. Hugh Christie Technology College has IT expertise. Further and higher education is available at West Kent College on Brook Street. There is also a small campus of the University of Kent. Tonbridge has many primary schools including Hilden Grange School and infant nurseries/daycare. Sport and leisure The 2007 Tour de France passed through the centre of Tonbridge on 8 July, as part of the first stage (London to Canterbury). The riders climbed Quarry Hill at the south of the town, a Grade 4 and the first King of the Mountains climb of the Tour. The town is home to two cricket clubs: Cowdrey CC and Tonbridge CC. Cowdrey Cricket Club was founded as Tonbridge Printers in 1948. On the club's 50th anniversary in 1998, it was decided to make a name change in honour of Lord Colin Cowdrey of Tonbridge. Cowdrey Cricket Club has a junior section and academy, as well as two Saturday teams - the 1st XI playing in Division III of the Kent League, and the 2nd XI in Division IV. The club plays at the Swanmead Sports Ground. Tonbridge Cricket Club is the oldest established cricket club in Tonbridge. Its large secluded ground features a modern pavilion, offering facilities to club members and visitors alike. The club competes in the Kent Cricket League Division IV on a Saturday and plays friendly matches, under the banner of Tonbridge Exiles CC, on a Sunday. The club has a junior section. Tonbridge Athletic Club which trains on the Tonbridge school track, is Kelly Holmes' former club. The Tonbridge Half Marathon has been held in September since 2011. Tonbridge has a Rugby union club, Tonbridge Juddians Rugby Football club., often referred to as TJs. The 2009/10 season saw the club's first XV win promotion and go unbeaten in the league for the second year running, they played their rugby in 2010/11 in London 1. The senior men's section of the club fields five sides plus a Vets team. The club has two girls teams (Under 15 and 18), and a junior and mini section. Tonbridge's football team, the Tonbridge Angels, play in the National League South - with the former manager of the England national football team, Roy Hodgson having played for them. The town has a canoe club that has produced a number of Olympic participants, and a dinghy sailing club, the Tonbridge Town Sailing Club, which holds events at Haysden Country Park on the outskirts of the town. Tonbridge Canoe Club was formed in 1977 to promote the various disciplines of canoeing from its base on the River Medway opposite Tonbridge Castle. The club meets every Saturday morning throughout the year, and on various weekday evenings for race training and general club sessions, the club has members actively participating in racing (sprint and marathon), touring, open canoeing and recreational paddling http://www.tonbridgecanoeclub.org.uk/ Tonbridge Swimming Club is based at the Tonbridge swimming pool which has indoor and outdoor pools. Tonbridge Baseball Club play in the town, after forming an adult team in 2000 from the junior team the Bobcats. The Bobcats were coached for many by Tonbridge Baseball Club's president Margaret Borley MBE. The town also has a big history in Motorcycle Racing and both Tonbridge & District MCC and Tonbridge & Malling MCC held both national and International meeting at the nearby Collier Street venue. Collier Street was home to The Boarded Circuit, a Grasstrack and Longtrack motorcycle racing circuit which held two or three events each season, most notably the International Bonfire Burnup. The circuit was unique in being the only fully boarded permanent Grasstrack venue in the UK. Tonbridge has a large number of amateur men's football teams with a number competing in the Sevenoaks & District Football League and the West Kent Sunday Football League. From the Sevenoaks League's there is: FC Revo, Roselands FC, Tonbridge Invicta FC & Woodlands FC. In the West Kent Sunday League there is: Artois United FC & Tonbridge Origin FC. The Angel Centre is a gym and leisure centre built on the site of the former Angel sports ground. As well as a gym and exercise class facilities, it hosts community events, conferences and markets. It was also formerly a concert venue - The Stone Roses, The Orb and Primal Scream are among acts who performed there in the 1980s and 1990s. Environment In 2014 the Angel Community Garden was created to eliminate eyesores in the area, and encourage bees which are declining. The garden has put along the edge of Sainsbury's car park. It was formed in collaboration with Tonbridge Friends of the Earth and Tonbridge & Malling Borough Council. The project also received some support from some local shopkeepers and residents. Parts of Tonbridge are at risk of flooding and a significant flooding event occurred in December 2013. The Environment Agency introduced a 320-metre long flood defence running parallel to the River Medway, along Avebury Avenue, in 2015, as a response to the flooding seen in 2013. Despite these measures, significant flooding occurred again in December 2019. Local media Tonbridge has two local commercial radio stations, KMFM West Kent, and Heart Kent, previously Invicta FM. The studios for KMFM are now based in Medway but were originally based in Tonbridge. The town is also served by county wide station BBC Radio Kent, and many London based stations can also be received. The local newspaper with the widest readership covering Tonbridge is the Kent and Sussex Courier. Climate Tonbridge experiences an oceanic climate (K√∂ppen climate classification Cfb), like all of Kent, and similar to almost all of the United Kingdom. Temperatures all year round are mild, with a low amount of precipitation. Snow sometimes occurs in the winter. On the 22nd of July 1868, the temperature reached , the British record until 2003.https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/an-exceptional-heatwave-dwdghrj2w Twin towns Tonbridge is twinned with the following places: * Le Puy-en- Velay, Haute-Loire, France * Heusenstamm, Hesse, Germany References External links Tonbridge local history society site including 900+ photos * Category:Towns in Kent Category:Market towns in Kent Category:Unparished areas in Kent Category:Tonbridge and Malling ","title":"Tonbridge"},{"id":"341107","text":"An ersatz () good is a substitute good, especially one that is considered inferior to the good it replaces. It has particular connotations of wartime usage. Etymology Ersatz is a German word literally meaning substitute or replacement. Although it is used as an adjective in English, it is a noun in German. In German orthography noun phrases formed are usually represented as a single word, forming compound nouns such as Ersatzteile (\\"spare parts\\") or Ersatzspieler (\\"substitute player\\"). While the term used in English often implies that the substitution is of unsatisfactory or inferior quality compared with the \\"real thing\\", in German, similar connotations are not inherent and depend purely on the factual context; e.g. Ersatzteile (\\"spare parts\\") is a technical expression without any implication about quality, whereas in other cases it may mean things of poorer quality, e.g. Kaffeeersatz (a coffee substitute not made from coffee beans). Historical context =World War I= In the opening months of World War I, replacement troops for battle-depleted German infantry units were drawn from lesser-trained Ersatz Corps, who were less effective than the troops they replaced. Another example of the word's usage in Germany exists in the German naval construction programs at the beginning of the 20th century. In this context, the phrasing \\"Ersatz (shipname)\\" indicates that a new, larger or more capable ship was a replacement for an ageing or lost vessel. Because German practice was not to reveal the name of a new ship until its launch, this meant that the ship was known by its \\"Ersatz (shipname)\\" throughout its construction. At the end of World War I, the last three ships of the planned of battlecruisers were redesigned and initially known simply as the , since the first ship was considered to be a replacement for the lost armored cruiser . The Allied naval blockade of Germany throttled maritime commerce with Germany, forcing Germany and Austria-Hungary to develop substitutes for products such as chemical compounds and provisions. More than 11,000 ersatz products were sold in Germany during the war. Patents for ersatz products were granted for 6000 varieties of beer, wine and lemonade; 1000 kinds of soup cubes; 837 types of sausage and 511 assortments of coffee. Ersatz products developed in Germany and Austria-Hungary during this time included: *synthetic rubber (Kautschuk)(produced from petroleum) *benzene for heating oil (coal gas) *industrial lubricants made by extracting oils from coal tar and brown-coal slags *synthetic camphor replaced imported natural camphor *gun cotton was replaced by nitrate crepe paper made from cellulose *glycerin was made from sugar rather than fats *gypsum yielded sulphur *pigeon guano were used to make fertilizer *flowers and weeds were processed to make alcohol for ammunition *rosins and gums were extracted from coal derivatives *tea composed of roasted barley, grasses, wild flowers, ground raspberry leaves or catnip *coffee substitute using roasted acorns, chicory and beechnuts (stretched with caramel-flavoured raw sugar and beet flower later in the war) *butter was replaced by curdled milk, sugar and food colouring *cooking oil was replaced by a mixture of beets, carrots, turnips and spices *salad oil was 99 per cent mucilage *eggs were replaced by yellow-coloured corn or potato flour *ground European beetles (cockchafers) and linden wood replaced fats *sausage was made of water, plant fibres, animal scraps and blood - (the infamous 'war sausage' which was equated to 'a mouthful of sawdust') *bouillon cubes were made 70-90 per cent of cooking salt instead of meat extracts *wheat flour was stretched by adding potato flour and powdered hay *chocolates and cocoa were replaced by ground cocoa shells and mixed pure pepper* *oil and sunflower 'cakes' replaced corn and oats as horse feed *rapeseed, poppy and mustard 'cakes' replaced green feed for cattle *paper, peat, reeds, bulrushes and free-growing stinging nettle fibres replaced cotton in textiles *wood and paper were used for shoe soles Germany also stretched its supply of gasoline with 'gasohol' (Benzolspiritus), which consisted of 75 parts petrol to 25 parts distilled alcohol. =World War II= In World War II, Ersatzbrot (substitute bread) made of potato starch, frequently stretched with extenders such as sawdust, was furnished to soldiers as Kommissbrot, a dark German bread baked from rye and other flours used for military rations, and also to prisoners of war. One recipe discovered in the Food Providing Ministry in Berlin, labeled \\"(Top Secret) Berlin 24.X1 1941,\\" contained 50% bruised rye grain, 20% sliced sugar beets, 20% \\"tree flour\\" (sawdust), and 10% minced leaves and straw. During the Siege of Leningrad, its citizens were given ersatz flour instead of actual wheat flour (of which there was an extremely limited supply of then) by the Soviet authorities. The lack of proper food with any nutrition meant that the city residents not only starved but became vulnerable to deadly illnesses and diseases (such as dysentery) owing to their weakened physical conditions. As a result, the word ersatz entered as a pejorative into Russian and other Slavic languages. In Britain, this was additionally popularised as an adjective from the experiences of thousands of U.S., British, and other English-speaking combat personnel, primarily airmen, who were captured in the European Theater of Operations during World War II. These Allied prisoners of war were given ersatz goods such as Ersatzkaffee, an inferior Getreidekaffee or \\"grain coffee\\" as a coffee substitute by their German captors. =Eastern Bloc= In the Eastern Bloc, many agricultural goods could not be produced domestically, such as tea, coffee, nuts, and citrus fruits. These were generally imported from abroad with scarce foreign currency reserves, or inferior substitutes were produced domestically. In 1977, the East German coffee crisis resulted in the introduction of many coffee substitutes, which were generally rejected by the population. Replacements for orangeat and succade were made from candied carrot and unripe tomatoes.  Effectiveness  When people are asked to choose an ersatz good, they tend to prefer a substitute from the same category as the good they desire to a goal-derived substitute, one that meets the same goal. For instance, a person who desires a gourmet chocolate is more likely to choose another, less expensive chocolate as a substitute than a different kind of dessert or snack. Because such \\"within-category\\" substitutes are easier to compare to the desired good, however, those that are inferior are less effective than \\"cross-category\\" substitutes that fulfill the same goal. People are more able to notice their inferiority during consumption, which leads them to be less satisfying than goal-derived substitutes from different taxonomic categories. During the First World War in Germany and Austria-Hungary, people succumbed to sickness from the consumption of ersatz goods. In Austria, the term 'Vienna sickness' was coined after malnutrition from was linked to a cause of the tuberculosis epidemic (10,000 reported cases) In Germany, Princess Bl√ºcher suffered from influenza in 1916, suggesting that she was suffering from \\"ersatz illness\\". She writes: \\"everyone is feeling ill from too many chemicals in the hotel food. I don't believe that Germany will ever be starved out, but she will be poisoned out first with these substitutes.\\" See also *Adulterant *Austerity *Backstop resources *Claytons, a word used in Australian and New Zealand English *Counterfeit *Giffen Good, a good for which there is no ersatz replacement, causing demand to rise with prices References Category:German words and phrases Category:Goods (economics) Category:Imitation foods Category:Perfect competition Category:Survival skills ","title":"Ersatz good"},{"id":"341110","text":"Athens (2016 Population 3,013) is a township in the United Counties of Leeds and Grenville in Eastern Ontario, Canada. It is located approximately 25 km north of the St. Lawrence River, near Brockville, west of Addison, and about 90 km south west of Ottawa. Formerly, it was a part of Yonge township before becoming Rear of Yonge and Escott with Athens as its own census division and finally, Athens township. The township consists of the town of Athens and a few other small communities. Formerly known as Farmersville, Benoni Wiltse, a United Empire Loyalist, and his brothers settled in the town of Athens in 1792. Farmersville was renamed to Athens in 1888 by Arza Parish in honour of Athens, Greece, because it was an educational centre with grammar school, a model school for teacher training, and a high school. Athens' post office was named in 1890. Currently, the town of Athens is known for a series of large outdoor murals depicting historical local life, painted on the sides of various buildings. Each year, a summer fair is held, called \\"Cornfest\\". This fair celebrates the harvest of corn and is held on the 3rd Saturday of August annually. Another celebration that is held each year is called the \\"Farmersville Exhibition\\", and is also known as \\"Steam Fair.\\" This fair celebrates the agricultural heritage of the town, and includes steam engines and antique tractors. This takes place in July. Athens has its own high school Athens District High School, which is under the Upper Canada District School Board, as well as a live entertainment venue Joshua Bates Centre which features a series of live musical performances each year.  Communities  Aside from Athens, the township consists of the communities of: Anoma Lea, Beales Mills, Charleston, Glen Elbe, Glen Morris, Hayes Corners, Wiltsetown. The township administrative offices are located in Athens. = Beales Mills = Beales Mills, Ontario is a small settlement located southwest of the town of Athens, close to Charleston. The community was settled around the mid-19th century by a Benjamin Beale for whom the settlement was named. Beale established a sawmill, gristmill, and a flour mill along the creek located through the settlement, now known as Beales Creek, as well as a shingle manufacturing business. The community relied on the nearby hamlet of Charleston for most of its needs, such as a post office, however Charleston relied on Beales Mills to supply water power to most of its businesses. Eventually, around the 1900s, the settlement began to decline as the mills closed. Presently, the site of Beales Mills consists of a few residential buildings most of which are modern. The ruins of a stone mill and dam can still be seen today. The settlement is largely considered a ghost town.  Cemeteries  The township of Athens is home to quite a few old burying grounds or cemeteries. Some of these cemeteries include: Barber Cemetery, an unregistered cemetery in Charleston called Charleston Village Cemetery, Temperance Lake Cemetery, Kincaid's Corners Cemetery, Holmes Cemetery, Lake Eloida Cemetery and an abandoned and unnamed pioneer cemetery. In the settlement of Wiltsetown, there is a cemetery called Wiltse Pioneer Cemetery that was established around 1795. Wiltse Pioneer Cemetery holds close to 300 interments, most of which are unmarked or marked by field stones instead of engraved tombstones. In the town of Athens, there is a Roman Catholic cemetery called St. Denis Roman Catholic Cemetery, as well as a non-denominational community cemetery. The community of Glen Elbe has its own cemetery which is no longer is use, but maintained by its own board. This cemetery dates to around 1840. East of Athens there is a Quaker cemetery simply called Quaker Cemetery which was established in the 1830s; this cemetery is no longer in use but is maintained by the township. Most of the stones here are badly deteriorated with only two being legible. East of Athens along Highway 42 is a mass gravesite associated with the House of Industry as it operated from 1895 until 1946 housing the sick, elderly or poor. The gravesite is currently marked by a large stone simply reading \\"Pioneers of Leeds & Grenville 1895 ‚Äì 1946\\". The original plans for the burial site included space for over 480 individuals in specific areas of the site however it is unclear if these plans were ever followed. Over one hundred graves are located here, of those who lived at the House of Industry between the aforementioned years and whose bodies remained unclaimed after death. For many years it was unclear where the graves were precisely located, as absolutely no records were kept and no grave markers were placed at the time. The mass grave became abandoned in 1946 when the House of Industry came under new management, who deemed the burial practices being used as undignified. A plot was then reserved in Glen Elbe cemetery for the unclaimed dead. In recent years, the long-neglected cemetery has been cleaned up and a fence was built around the stone memorial. A cooperative effort between local genealogical societies has recently discovered the approximate boundaries of the burial plot by dowsing for grave sites.

It is south of Highway 401. The mayor is Mary French. Aylmer is surrounded by Malahide Township. History In October 1817, John Van Patter, an immigrant from New York State, obtained 80 ha of land and became the first contemporary settler on the site of Aylmer. During the 1830s a general store was opened and village lots sold. Originally called Troy, in 1835 it was renamed Aylmer after Lord Aylmer, then Governor-in-Chief of British North America. By 1851 local enterprises included sawmills and flour-mills powered by water from Catfish Creek. Aided by easy access to Lake Erie, Aylmer became by the mid-1860s the marketing centre for a rich agricultural and timber producing area. Benefiting greatly from the construction of the 230 km Canada Air Line Railway from Glencoe to Fort Erie, Aylmer became an incorporated village in 1872 and a town in 1887. A Royal Canadian Air Force Training Facility, RCAF Station Aylmer was located just north of Aylmer in Malahide Township from 1941 to 1961. This station is now home to the Ontario Police College and The Aylmer Wildlife Management Area. Former mayor (1994‚Äì2003) Robert Habkirk was again elected the mayor of Aylmer on November 13, 2006 to a four-year term. He was defeated by the former principal of East Elgin Secondary School, Jack Couckuyt, by a wide margin on October 25, 2010. In 2004, a new arena, the East Elgin Community Complex, was completed to house the many hockey leagues in town. The Old Town Hall which houses the library, also has a restored theatre which houses occasional plays. For history buffs, the Aylmer Museum houses a collection of 19th century Victorian art pieces created from hair. In 2007, Communities in Bloom, a nationwide beautification program, awarded Aylmer first place in Canada in the 5001 to 10,000 population category. The community drew attention during the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic when a local church held drive-in worship services, where parishioners remained in their cars and local police threatened them with 100,000 CAD fines for allegedly violating provincial restrictions on public gatherings. https://globalnews.ca/news/6887824/coronavirus-aylmer- police-church-of-god-drive-in-service/, retrieved May 2nd 2020 Mennonite and Amish communities In the mid-1970s, many German-speaking Mennonites began migrating to the Aylmer area from Mexico. The Mennonites were Canadian citizens who had moved to Mexico from Manitoba and Saskatchewan during the first half of the 20th century. By the early 21st century, there was a large Mennonite population in Aylmer and the surrounding area. In addition to the Mennonite population there are sizable Dutch, German, and British descended populations in the area. Just east of Aylmer is a sizable Old Order Amish community. This community was founded by families moving from Ohio in 1953. They were uncomfortable with a nuclear facility being constructed close to their community in Ohio. Since that time, the community has grown to encompass three \\"districts\\" in the surrounding area. A number of members from this community participate in the weekly Aylmer Sales Barn and sell fruit, vegetables, eggs, and animals, such as rabbits and chickens. This particular Amish community eschews the use of automobiles, electricity, and most modern conveniences. An Amish publishing house, Pathway Publishers, is based in the community. Tobacco industry The tobacco-growing industry played a large part in the economic development of Aylmer. Imperial Tobacco Canada built a plant in Aylmer in the mid-1940s. At its peak, Imperial employed more than 800 full-time and seasonal workers. After declining tobacco sales in Canada, Imperial began downsizing in the 1990s. In October 2005, Imperial Tobacco announced that the Aylmer and Guelph, Ontario plants would close. The plant closed permanently in July 2007, putting the remaining 75 employees out of work. Ontario Police College In the early 1950s, the Ontario Association of Chiefs of Police (OACP) proposed the idea of a central provincial police academy. In 1959 the Attorney General appointed an advisory committee on police training in 1962 announced the formal establishment of the college. OPC offered its first classes beginning January 7, 1963 in the temporary wartime training quarters of an abandoned Royal Canadian Air Force base near Aylmer, Ontario. In 1976 the college moved to its present facilities. The College Is situated on 121.5 hectares of rural land five kilometers northeast of the town of Aylmer, Ontario (190 km west of Toronto). The college has 165 full and part-time employees including instructors, support and seconded staff. The 45 permanent instructors are supplemented by police officers from various police services, usually for two-year periods. With very rare exceptions, all Police Officers in Ontario, Canada attend the college for their 13-week program in order to receive their Basic Constables Training Diploma. Once they have received the Diploma and after they have been sworn in as Peace Officers, they can then work in the Province of Ontario as police officers. Aylmer Fair The Aylmer Fair is a non-profit society run by the OAAS (Ontario Association of Agricultural Societies). They are the oldest agricultural fair in District 13. It is run by a board of Directors, and volunteers in the area. In 1846, the Aylmer and East Elgin Agricultural Society (formally known as the Malahide Agricultural Society up until 1860) began its annual exhibitions of agriculture and livestock to the people in and around the Aylmer area. In 30 years the fair grew from a few dozen exhibits in the 1850s to over 1700 in 1876. The Aylmer fair also expanded from an afternoon show to a two-day event and membership to the Society has grown to over 200 members. It was not until 1865 that ladies' exhibitions were included in the fair. Stock and wheat became uninteresting and was not likely to attract exhibitors and visitors. \\"Women's Work\\" was an essential, interesting and an attracting element in the success of the fair. In 1874, 523 entries (1/6th of the exhibits) were based largely on Women's Work. Throughout the early years the fair travelled and was held in many locations, but found its permanent location in 1875 in Aylmer, where 8 acres of land was purchased. In this year the fair held its first opening day, surrounded by a high well built board fence, charging $.10 for admission into the fair. The Aylmer Fair entered the 20th Century with unparalleled success. Businessmen supported it eagerly through donations and participation and even helped decorate the town for the fair days. It was known as \\"Aylmer's Greatest Fair,\\" with a train excursion that travelled from Hamilton, London and St. Thomas with passengers wanting to see the fair. However, after issues of agricultural exhibits versus expensive attractions by business men, in 1910 the fair was cancelled. Farmers and others complained that throughout the preceding years, the extravagant attractions that were created leveled the significance that agriculture and livestock was given. It was a struggle to get the fair up and running again with many problems each year including funding issues and low admission rates until 1924. A turnover in personnel and the government granted more funding, this turning point created major changes in attractions and promotions over the next six years. During the 1940s, the war effort was a major theme of the fair. In 1941, admission costs, membership fees and 50% of the profits were given to the Red Cross and a war bond was purchased with the remaining 50%. The fair held its Centennial in 1956, celebrating its 100-year anniversary and the achievements it had developed. From 1945-1965 was the greatest period in the fair's history. No period prior had sustained such growth in all aspects of the fair: in buildings, attendance, and growth of exhibits and in general participation. It has continued to grow. 1977 created a new record in attendance of 47,000 people present at the two-day event. It continues to grow every year, with great attractions including agriculture, family activities and midway events. 2013 marks the 168th year at the Aylmer Fair.Desert Sand by Free Css Templates .

Most fishways enable fish to pass around the barriers by swimming and leaping up a series of relatively low steps (hence the term ladder) into the waters on the other side. The velocity of water falling over the steps has to be great enough to attract the fish to the ladder, but it cannot be so great that it washes fish back downstream or exhausts them to the point of inability to continue their journey upriver. History Denil Fishway on Salmon Creek, Montana Written reports of rough fishways date to 17th-century France, where bundles of branches were used to create steps in steep channels to bypass obstructions. A version was patented in 1837 by Richard McFarlan of Bathurst, New Brunswick, Canada, who designed a fishway to bypass a dam at his water-powered lumber mill.Mario Theriault, Great Maritime Inventions 1833‚Äì1950, Goose Lane, 2001, p. 45 In 1852‚Äì1854, the Ballisodare Fish Pass was built in County Sligo in Ireland to draw salmon into a river that had not supported a fishery. In 1880, the first fish ladder was built in Rhode Island, United States, on the Pawtuxet Falls Dam. The ladder was removed in 1924, when the City of Providence replaced the wood dam with a concrete one. Concrete ladders are not always an improvement ‚Äì the electric field- sensitive organs of the paddlefish are overloaded in the proximity of the rebar and other metal used in concrete construction, preventing them from gaining access to their spawning grounds and contributing to a catastrophic decline in their numbers. As the Industrial Age advanced, dams and other river obstructions became larger and more common, leading to the need for effective fish by-passes.Office Of Technology Assessment Washington DC (1995) Fish passage technologies : protection at hydropower facilities Diana Publishing, . Types There are six main types of fishways: ;Pool and weir: One of the oldest styles of fish ladders. It uses a series of small dams and pools of regular length to create a long, sloping channel for fish to travel around the obstruction. The channel acts as a fixed lock to gradually step down the water level; to head upstream, fish must jump over from box to box in the ladder. ;Baffle fishway: Uses a series of symmetrical close-spaced baffles in a channel to redirect the flow of water, allowing fish to swim around the barrier. Baffle fishways need not have resting areas, although pools can be included to provide a resting area or to reduce the velocity of the flow. Such fishways can be built with switchbacks to minimize the space needed for their construction. Baffles come in variety of designs. The original design for a Denil fishway was developed in 1909 by a Belgian scientist, G. Denil; it has since been adjusted and adapted in many ways. The Alaskan Steeppass, for example, is a modular prefabricated Denil-fishway variant originally designed for remote areas of Alaska. Baffles have been installed by Project Maitai in several waterways in Nelson, New Zealand, to improve fish passage as part of general environmental restoration. ;Fish elevator (or fish lift): Breaks with the ladder design by providing a sort of elevator to carry fish over a barrier. It is well suited to tall barriers. With a fish elevator, fish swim into a collection area at the base of the obstruction. When enough fish accumulate in the collection area, they are nudged into a hopper that carries them into a flume that empties into the river above the barrier. On the Connecticut River, for example, two fish elevators lift up to 500 fish at a time, 52 feet (15.85 m), to clear the Holyoke Dam. In 2013, the elevator carried over 400,000 fish. ;Rock-ramp fishway: Uses large rocks and timbers to create pools and small falls that mimic natural structures. Because of the length of the channel needed for the ladder, such structures are most appropriate for relatively short barriers. They have a significant advantage in that they can provide fish spawning habitat. ;Vertical-slot fish passage: Similar to a pool-and-weir system, except that each \\"dam\\" has a narrow slot in it near the channel wall. This allows fish to swim upstream without leaping over an obstacle. Vertical-slot fish passages also tend to handle reasonably well the seasonal fluctuation in water levels on each side of the barrier. Recent studies suggest that navigation locks have a potential to be operated as vertical slot fishways to provide increased access for a range of biota, including poor swimmers.Quaranta, E., Katopodis, C., Revelli, R., Comoglio, C.

They vary in effectiveness for different types of species, with one study showing that only three percent of American Shad make it through all the fish ladders on the way to their spawning ground. Effectiveness depends on the fish species' swimming ability, and how the fish moves up and downstream. A fish passage that is designed to allow fish to pass upstream may not allow passage downstream, for instance. Fish passages do not always work. In practice a challenge is matching swimming performance data to hydrodynamic measurements. Swim tests rarely use the same protocol and the output is either a single-point measurement or a bulk velocity. In contrast, physical and numerical modelling of fluid flow (i.e. hydrodynamics) deliver a detailed flow map, with a fine spatial and temporal resolution. Regulatory agencies face a difficult task to match hydrodynamic measurements and swimming performance data. Culverts During the last three decades, the ecological impact of culverts on natural streams and rivers has been recognised. While the culvert discharge capacity derives from hydrological and hydraulic engineering considerations, this results often in large velocities in the barrel, creating a possible fish passage barrier. Baffles may be installed along the barrel invert to provide some fish-friendly alternative. For low discharges, the baffles decrease the flow velocity and increase the water depth to facilitate fish passage. At larger discharges, baffles induce lower local velocities and generate recirculation regions. Unfortunately, baffles can reduce drastically the culvert discharge capacity for a given afflux, thus increasing substantially the total cost of the culvert structure to achieve the same design discharge and afflux. It is believed that fish-turbulence interplay may facilitate upstream migration, albeit an optimum design must be based upon a careful characterisation of both hydrodynamics and fish kinematics. Finally the practical engineering design implications cannot be ignored, while a solid understanding of turbulence typology is a basic requirement to any successful boundary treatment conducive of upstream fish passage.

According to Frankl, the way a prisoner imagined the future affected his longevity. The book intends to answer the question \\"How was everyday life in a concentration camp reflected in the mind of the average prisoner?\\" Part One constitutes Frankl's analysis of his experiences in the concentration camps, while Part Two introduces his ideas of meaning and his theory called logotherapy. According to a survey conducted by the Book-of-the-Month Club and the Library of Congress, Man's Search for Meaning belongs to a list of \\"the ten most influential books in the United States.\\" At the time of the author's death in 1997, the book had sold over 10 million copies and had been translated into 24 languages. Editions The book's original title in German is ...trotzdem Ja zum Leben sagen: Ein Psychologe erlebt das Konzentrationslager: that is, \\"...Nevertheless saying 'Yes' to Life: A Psychologist Experiences the Concentration Camp\\". The title of the first English-language translation was From Death-Camp to Existentialism. The book's common full English title is Man's Search for Meaning: An Introduction to Logotherapy, although this subtitle is often not printed on the cover of modern editions.Man's Search for Meaning, Viktor Frankl. Beacon Press, 2006, Experiences in a concentration camp Frankl identifies three psychological reactions experienced by all inmates to one degree or another: (1) shock during the initial admission phase to the camp, (2) apathy after becoming accustomed to camp existence, in which the inmate values only that which helps himself and his friends survive, and (3) reactions of depersonalization, moral deformity, bitterness, and disillusionment if he survives and is liberated. Frankl concludes that the meaning of life is found in every moment of living; life never ceases to have meaning, even in suffering and death. In a group therapy session during a mass fast inflicted on the camp's inmates trying to protect an anonymous fellow inmate from fatal retribution by authorities, Frankl offered the thought that for everyone in a dire condition there is someone looking down, a friend, family member, or even God, who would expect not to be disappointed. Frankl concludes from his experience that a prisoner's psychological reactions are not solely the result of the conditions of his life, but also from the freedom of choice he always has even in severe suffering. The inner hold a prisoner has on his spiritual self relies on having a hope in the future, and that once a prisoner loses that hope, he is doomed. Frankl also concludes that there are only two races of men, decent men and indecent. No society is free of either of them, and thus there were \\"decent\\" Nazi guards and \\"indecent\\" prisoners, most notably the kapo who would torture and abuse their fellow prisoners for personal gain. His concluding passage in Part One describes the psychological reaction of the inmates to their liberation, which he separates into three stages. The first is depersonalization‚Äîa period of readjustment, in which a prisoner gradually returns to the world. Initially, the liberated prisoners are so numb that they are unable to understand what freedom means, or to emotionally respond to it. Part of them believes that it is an illusion or a dream that will be taken away from them. In their first foray outside their former prison, the prisoners realized that they could not comprehend pleasure. Flowers and the reality of the freedom they had dreamed about for years were all surreal, unable to be grasped in their depersonalization. The body is the first element to break out of this stage, responding by big appetites of eating and wanting more sleeping. Only after the partial replenishing of the body is the mind finally able to respond, as \\"feeling suddenly broke through the strange fetters which had restrained it\\" (111). This begins the second stage, in which there is a danger of deformation. As the intense pressure on the mind is released, mental health can be endangered. Frankl uses the analogy of a diver suddenly released from his pressure chamber. He recounts the story of a friend who became immediately obsessed with dispensing the same violence in judgment of his abusers that they had inflicted on him. Upon returning home, the prisoners had to struggle with two fundamental experiences which could also damage their mental health: bitterness and disillusionment. The last stage is bitterness at the lack of responsiveness of the world outside‚Äîa \\"superficiality and lack of feeling...so disgusting that one finally felt like creeping into a hole and neither hearing nor seeing human beings any more\\" (113). Worse was disillusionment, which was the discovery that suffering does not end, that the longed-for happiness will not come. This was the experience of those who‚Äîlike Frankl‚Äîreturned home to discover that no one awaited them. The hope that had sustained them throughout their time in the concentration camp was now gone. Frankl cites this experience as the most difficult to overcome. As time passed, however, the prisoner's experience in a concentration camp finally became nothing but a remembered nightmare. What is more, he comes to believe that he has nothing left to fear any more, \\"except his God\\" (115). Reception The book has been identified as one of the most influential books in the United States. At the time of Frankl's death in 1997, the book had sold over 10 million copies and had been translated into 24 languages. However, aspects of the book have garnered criticism. One of Frankl's main claims in the book is that a positive attitude was essential to surviving the camps. Consequently, he implied and thus helped perpetuate the pervasive myth that those who died had given up. Historians have concluded by contrast that there was little connection between attitude and survival and in reality the implication that Holocaust victims were partially responsible for their fate contained in the book is a derangement of the historical record. Holocaust analyst Lawrence L. Langer finds Frankl's promotion of his logotherapy ideology, the problematic subtext, the tone of self-aggrandizement and general inhumane sense of studying-detachment with which Frankl appears to have treated the victims of the Holocaust, as all deeply problematic.[Lawrence Langer, Versions of Survival: The Holocaust and the Human Spirit (Albany: State University of New York Press, 1982), p.24. [End Page 107] In his book Faith in Freedom, psychiatrist Thomas Szasz states that Frankl's \\"survivor\\" testimony was written to misdirect, and betrays instead an intent of a transparent effort to conceal Frankl's actions, his collaboration with the Nazis and that in the assessment of Raul Hilberg, the founder of Holocaust studies, Frankl's historical account is placed in the same category of a deception, a deceit as Binjamin Wilkomirski's infamous memoirs, itself translated into nine languages, before exposure as a fraud in Hilberg's 1996 Politics of Memory.Faith in Freedom, pg 181 Thomas Szasz It is for this and the other controversial facets of Frankl's career, that none of his works, at the time of a 1990s interview, have ever been on sale in the bookstore of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington D.C.

Name The spelling of the Welsh name in standard modern orthography is Meirionnydd (for the geographical area) or Sir Feirionnydd (for the county), with a double , but the variant with a single is sometimes found in older works.Double 'nn' is found in the title of a number of Welsh-language books, e.g. Crwydro Meirionnydd, a companion to the area by T. I. Ellis (Llandybie, 1954), and the county atlas published by the old county council (Atlas Merionnydd, Y Bala, 1972).For the single 'n' variant see, for example, Melville Richards, Welsh Administrative and Territorial Units. University of Wales Press, Cardiff 1969. The name is derived from that of the earlier cantref of Meirionnydd. This supposedly took its name from Meirion, a grandson of Cunedda Wledig, who was granted the lordship of the area.Morris. A. (1913) Cambridge County Geographies: Merionethshire, Cambridge University Press, p.3 Geography Merionethshire is a maritime county, bounded to the north by Caernarfonshire, to the east by Denbighshire, to the south by Montgomeryshire and Cardiganshire, and to the west by Cardigan Bay. With a total area of 1,731 km¬≤ (668 sq miles), it is one of the more sparsely populated counties in Great Britain. The Merioneth area remains one of the strongest Welsh-speaking parts of Wales, although places like Barmouth and Tywyn are very Anglicised. The coastline consists alternately of cliffs and stretches of sand and the area generally is the most mountainous in Wales; a large part of the Snowdonia National Park lies within it. The highest point (county top) is Aran Fawddwy near the village of Dinas Mawddwy at 905 m (2,970 ft), which is also the southernmost mountain in Great Britain to exceed an altitude of 900 metres. However, the mountain of Cadair Idris 893 m (2,929 ft) to the south of Dolgellau is better known and hugely popular with hillwalkers. Other mountains include Arenig Fawr and the Rhinogydd. The chief rivers are the Dwyryd, the Mawddach, the Dyfi and the Dee, while in the south the Dulas forms the county boundary. Waterfalls such as Pistyll Cain and small lakes are numerous, the largest being Bala Lake (4 miles long and broad). History The region which became Merionethshire previously constituted the Cantrefs of Meirionydd and Penllyn, and the Commote of Ardudwy. Prior to the 10th century, Ardudwy formed part of the principality of Dunoding, while Meirionydd and Penllyn were part of Powys. Welsh records from the end of this period, and later, treat Dunoding as a vassal of Gwynedd, ruled by an ancient cadet branch of the same family. Nevertheless, according to John Edward Lloyd, Dunoding had been independent of Gwynedd, at the time of Cadfan ap Iago (in the early 7th century), and before. The Norman presence in England, after 1066, was the most significant factor which disrupted this pattern. In 1067, the rulers of Gwynedd and Powys invaded England, in support of Eadric the Wild, a leader of continued Saxon resistance against the Normans. When Northern England revolted against in 1080, the Normans responded by preemptively attacking, and then occupying Wales, to prevent any further Welsh assistance to the English. In 1094, the Welsh decided to revolt, but Hugh of Chester, the nearest Norman magnate, successfully re-captured North Wales by the end of 1098 (with Norwegian assistance). Gruffudd ap Cynan, the heir to the principality of Gwynedd, came to an accommodation with the Normans, who restored him to power in Gwynedd, excepting the Perfeddwlad. Once Hugh died (in 1101), Gruffudd made further representations to King Henry I, who in response granted Dunodin to Gruffudd, as well. Gruffudd's sons engaged in expansionist attacks on surrounding territory, taking Meirionydd from Powys in 1123, and annexing it to Gwynedd. Following the death of Madog ap Maredudd, the powerful ruler of Powys, and the death of his immediate heir, Madog's remaining sons divided Powys between them. Penllyn was the portion which went to Owain Brogyntyn. Unfortunately Owain was too weak, compared with his father, to resist Gwynedd's aggressive behaviour, and was forced to become a vassal of Owain Gwynedd, the son of Gruffudd who now ruled Gwynedd; Penllyn, as a result, became a mere Cantref of Gwynedd. Dunoding is naturally divided in the middle, by Tremadog Bay and the gorges and marshland of the Glaslyn river; Ardudwy is the portion south of that divide. In the early 13th century, Llywelyn Fawr, Owain Gwynedd's grandson, established a distinct territorial unit comprising Ardudwy and Meirionydd (which is immediately south of Ardudwy), and gave it to his own son, Gruffydd, as an appanage. In 1221, however, Gruffydd was stripped of these lands for ruling them too oppressively. In 1245, Gruffydd's half- brother, Dafydd, launched an attack against his uncle - King Henry III - eventually resulting in the loss of the Perfeddwlad. When Gruffydd's son, Llywelyn, allied with the enemies of Edward I (Henry's son) and tried to recover the Perfeddwlad, Edward launched a huge invasion of Gwynedd, resulting in the death of Llywelyn in 1282. Two years later, in 1284, King Edward issued the Statute of Rhuddlan, terminating Gwynedd's existence as a state. The former appanage of Ardudwy-Merionydd, together with Penllyn, which had been part of Gwynedd for less than 150 years, were converted into Merionethshire (taking the name from Meirionydd). Merioneth was an important part of the Welsh slate industry in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, with major quarrying centres at Blaenau Ffestiniog in the north of the county and Corris in the south. =Administration= An administrative county of Merioneth was created under the Local Government Act 1888 on 1 April 1889. The first election to the new authority was held in January 1889. The county was abolished under the Local Government Act 1972 on 1 April 1974. The bulk formed the Meirionnydd district of Gwynedd, with a small area in the north east, Edeirnion Rural District, becoming part of the Glynd≈µr district of Clwyd. As a result of the Local Government (Wales) Act 1994, which came into force on 1 April 1996, the Glynd≈µr area was made a part of the new Denbighshire principal area, with the rest forming a new Caernarfonshire and Merionethshire principal area. The latter area was, however, renamed Gwynedd almost immediately.

The welding apparatus contains an induction coil that is energised with a radio-frequency electric current. This generates a high- frequency electromagnetic field that acts on either an electrically conductive or a ferromagnetic workpiece. In an electrically conductive workpiece, the main heating effect is resistive heating, which is due to induced currents called eddy currents. In a ferromagnetic workpiece, the heating is caused mainly by hysteresis, as the electromagnetic field repeatedly distorts the magnetic domains of the ferromagnetic material. In practice, most materials undergo a combination of these two effects. Nonmagnetic materials and electrical insulators such as plastics can be induction-welded by implanting them with metallic or ferromagnetic compounds, called susceptors, that absorb the electromagnetic energy from the induction coil, become hot, and lose their heat to the surrounding material by thermal conduction. Plastic can also be induction welded by embedding the plastic with electrically conductive fibers like metals or carbon fiber. Induced eddy currents resistively heat the embedded fibers which lose their heat to the surrounding plastic by conduction. Induction welding of carbon fiber reinforced plastics is commonly used in the aerospace industry. Induction welding is used for long production runs and is a highly automated process, usually used for welding the seams of pipes. It can be a very fast process, as a lot of power can be transferred to a localised area, so the faying surfaces melt very quickly and can be pressed together to form a continuous rolling weld. The depth that the currents, and therefore heating, penetrates from the surface is inversely proportional to the square root of the frequency. The temperature of the metals being welded and their composition will also affect the penetration depth. This process is very similar to resistance welding, except that in the case of resistance welding the current is delivered using contacts to the workpiece instead of using induction. Induction welding was first discovered by Michael Faraday. The basics of induction welding explain that the magnetic field's direction is dependent on the direction of current flow. and the field's direction will change at the same rate as the current's frequency. For example, a 120 Hz AC current will cause the field to change directions 120 times a second. This concept is known as Faraday's Law. When induction welding takes place, the work pieces heat up to under the melting temperature and the edges of the pieces are placed together impurities get forced out to give a solid forge weld. Induction welding is used for joining a multitude of thermoplastics and thermosetting matrix composites. The apparatus used for induction welding processes includes a radio frequency power generator, a heating station, the work piece material, and a cooling system. The power generator comes in either the form of solid state or vacuum tube and is used to provide an alternating current of 230-340 V or a frequency of 50-60 Hz to the system. This value is determined by what induction coil is used with the piece. The heat station utilizes a capacitor and a coil to heat the work pieces. The capacitor matches the power generators output and the induction coil transfers energy to the piece. When welding the coil needs to be close to the work piece to maximize the energy transfer and the work piece used during induction welding is an important key component of optimal efficiency. Some equations to consider for induction welding include: Thermal calculation: \\\\bar{Q}(x, t)= {\\\\eta(J_0^2)\\\\rho \\\\over C_r} Where: C_r is thermal mass \\\\rho is resistivity \\\\eta is efficiency J_0 is surface density Newton Cooling Equation: q^n=h(T_s- T_B) Where: q^n is heat flux density h is the heat transfer coefficient T_s is the temperature of the work piece surface T_B is the temperature of the surrounding air See also *Induction heating *Implant induction welding of thermoplastics References *AWS Welding Handbook, Volume 2, 8th Edition *.

His pieces employed \\"dissonant counterpoint\\", a term coined by Charles Seeger to describe Ruggles' music. His method of atonal counterpoint was based on a non-serial technique of avoiding repeating a pitch class until a generally fixed number such as eight pitch classes intervened. He wrote painstakingly slowly so his output is quite small. Famous for his prickly personality, Ruggles was nonetheless friends with Henry Cowell, Edgard Var√®se, Charles Ives, Thomas Hart Benton, Ruth Crawford Seeger, and Charles Seeger. Benton even painted Ruggles in his portrait \\"The Suntreader\\". His students include James Tenney and Merton Brown. Conductor Michael Tilson Thomas has championed Ruggles' music, recording the complete works with the Buffalo Philharmonic and occasionally performing Sun-Treader with the San Francisco Symphony. Especially later in life, Ruggles was also a prolific painter, selling hundreds of paintings during his lifetime. Biography Carl Ruggles was born in Marion, Massachusetts on March 11, 1876. His mother died at an early age and he was raised mainly by his grandmother. Ruggles' father, Nathaniel, was rumored to have a gambling problem and lost most of the family's inherited wealth. Ruggles was never very close to his father and did not see him from the age of 29 onwards. He modified his given name Charles to the more Teutonic Carl at an early age, partially due to his great admiration for German composers, especially Richard Wagner and Richard Strauss. Though he never legally changed it, he signed all documents and works in his adult life \\"Carl Ruggles\\". He began taking violin lessons at the age of four with a local itinerant music teacher. He continued playing and gave performances on the violin, which were usually well received. He was appointed director of the YMCA orchestra in 1892. A reviewer wrote: \\"A musical program of entertainment was rendered in the church, each number of which received hearty applause. Master Charles Ruggles' violin selections were rendered with much feeling and delicacy. He captivated the audience by his manly bearing, and is evidently at home in the concert room.\\" In 1899, C.W. Thompson & Co. published Ruggles' first compositions, three songs titled How Can I Be Blythe and Glad, At Sea and Maiden with Thy Mouth of Roses. The first song is one of two surviving compositions from his early days; all others are presumed to have been destroyed by Ruggles himself. Eventually Ruggles had to work to support himself as his family's financial situation worsened. He worked a number of odd jobs and started to teach violin and music theory privately, though teaching did not provide much income or success. In 1902 he started writing music criticism for the Belmont Tribune and the Watertown Tribune. This continued until July 1903. Ruggles' reviews are characteristically brash. He did not hesitate to express his opinion, laudatory or not. In 1906, he met Charlotte Snell, a contralto. Ruggles began a search for steady employment so that he and Charlotte could marry. This led him to Winona, Minnesota, to work for the Mar D'Mar School of Music as a violin teacher. He became active as a soloist as well, eventually directing the Winona Symphony Orchestra. Charlotte joined him as a vocal teacher at Mar d'Mar. Ruggles continued to direct the symphony after the music school closed. Charlotte then was a choir mistress at the First Baptist Church and Ruggles was hired to conduct the YMCA orchestra and glee club. They also took private students. In 1912 Ruggles moved to New York and began writing an opera based on the German play The Sunken Bell by Gerhart Hauptmann. Due to both his sluggish composing pace and anti-German sentiment as a result of World War I, he never finished the opera, though he submitted a version to the Metropolitan Opera. He destroyed what he had written after he decided he lacked the instinct required for the stage. Ruggles continued to compose, supplementing his income by giving composition lessons. For his son's fourth birthday in 1919 he wrote Toys for soprano and piano, his first composition in his atonal, contrapuntal style. He continued to live and compose in New York until 1938, when he began teaching composition at the University of Miami, where he remained until 1943. He then moved to a converted one-room school in Vermont where he spent his time revising compositions and painting. He also painted hundreds of paintings over the course of his lifetime and he was offered the opportunity to have one-man shows. He was elected to membership in the National Institute of Arts and Letters in 1963. According to Donal Henahan, Ruggles \\"spoke with an earthiness that shocked many people. He smoked cigars and told dirty stories. He attacked his fellow composers, sneering at almost everyone but Ives. He refused to play the part of the genteel artist.\\" Known for his profanity, Ruggles was also anti-semitic. For example, he wrote to Henry Cowell about, \\"that filthy bunch of Juilliard Jews ... cheap, without dignity, and with little or no talent,\\" especially targeting Arthur Berger.Robert Morse Crunden, Body & Soul: The Making of American Modernism (2000), 42‚Äì3. His friend Lou Harrison dissociated himself from Ruggles after the 1949 performance of Angels because of the older composer's racism, noting specifically a luncheon at Pennsylvania Station in New York at which Ruggles shouted anti-black and anti-semitic slurs.Leta E. Miller and Frederic Lieberman. Composing a World: Lous Harrison, Musical Wayfarer (Oxford University Press, 1998), pp. 42‚Äì44 Ruggles' wife died in 1957. They had one son, Micah. Ruggles died in Bennington, Vermont, on October 24, 1971, after a long illness. Music Ruggles' compositional style was \\"trial and error. He sat at the piano and moved his fingers around, listened hard to the sounds... shouting out some of the lines.\\"Marilyn J. Ziffrin. Carl Ruggles: Composer, Painter, and Storyteller Music in American life. (Urbana, IL.: University of Illinois Press, 1994), p. 83. According to Ruggles himself, he never learned any music theory and never analyzed other composers' pieces. The majority of his early works (before Toys) were destroyed, leaving their compositional style a matter of speculation. Reviews suggest similarities to late 19th-century romanticism. His dissonant, contrapuntal style is similar to Arnold Schoenberg's, although he did not employ the same twelve-tone system. He used a method similar to and perhaps influenced by Charles Seeger's dissonant counterpoint, and generally avoided repeating a pitch class within eight notes. He also never used sprechstimme in any vocal works, although he admired Schoenberg's Pierrot Lunaire. He only completed ten pieces due to his lengthy process of composition and revision. Sun-Treader, his best known work, is scored for a large orchestra. It was inspired by the poem \\"Pauline\\" by Robert Browning, particularly the line \\"Sun- treader, light and life be thine forever!\\". The most common intervals in the piece are minor seconds, perfect fourths and augmented fourths. One group of intervals he uses are fourths in sequence where the respective notes are either 13 or 11 semitones apart; the other is three notes which are chromatically related, though often separated by an octave. Another distinctive feature of Sun-Treader is the presence of \\"waves\\", both in dynamics and pitch. Pitches will start low, then rise up to a climax, then descend again. Within the ascent (and descent) there are small descents (and ascents) leading to a self-similar (fractal) overall structure. Sun-Treader premiered in Paris on February 25, 1932. Jean Martinon conducted the Boston Symphony Orchestra in its U.S. premiere in Portland, Maine, on January 24, 1966, as part of a Bowdoin College tribute marking Ruggles' 90th birthday. Ruggles is one of the composers, collectively known as The American Five alongside other American modernist composers Charles Ives (1874‚Äì1954), John J.

Similar matrices represent the same linear map under two (possibly) different bases, with being the change of basis matrix. A transformation is called a similarity transformation or conjugation of the matrix . In the general linear group, similarity is therefore the same as conjugacy, and similar matrices are also called conjugate; however in a given subgroup of the general linear group, the notion of conjugacy may be more restrictive than similarity, since it requires that be chosen to lie in .  Motivating example  When defining a linear transformation, it can be the case that a change of basis can result in a simpler form of the same transformation. For example, the matrix representing a rotation in when the axis of rotation is not aligned with the coordinate axis can be complicated to compute. If the axis of rotation were aligned with the positive -axis, then it would simply be :S = \\\\begin{bmatrix} \\\\cos\\\\theta & -\\\\sin\\\\theta & 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\sin\\\\theta & \\\\cos\\\\theta & 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & 0 & 1 \\\\end{bmatrix}, where \\\\theta is the angle of rotation. In the new coordinate system, the transformation would be written as :y' = Sx', where and are respectively the original and transformed vectors in a new basis containing a vector parallel to the axis of rotation. In the original basis, the transform would be written as :y = Tx, where vectors and and the unknown transform matrix are in the original basis. To write in terms of the simpler matrix, we use the change-of- basis matrix that transforms and as x' = Px and y' = Py: :\\\\begin{align} & &y;' &= Sx' \\\\\\\\\\\\ &\\\\Rightarrow &Py; &= SPx \\\\\\\\\\\\ &\\\\Rightarrow & y &= \\\\left(P^{-1}SP\\\\right)x = Tx \\\\end{align} Thus, the matrix in the original basis is given by T = P^{-1}SP. The transform in the original basis is found to be the product of three easy-to-derive matrices. In effect, the similarity transform operates in three steps: change to a new basis (), perform the simple transformation (), and change back to the old basis ().  Properties  Similarity is an equivalence relation on the space of square matrices. Because matrices are similar if and only if they represent the same linear operator with respect to (possibly) different bases, similar matrices share all properties of their shared underlying operator: *Rank *Characteristic polynomial, and attributes that can be derived from it: **Determinant **Trace **Eigenvalues, and their algebraic multiplicities *Geometric multiplicities of eigenvalues (but not the eigenspaces, which are transformed according to the base change matrix P used). *Minimal polynomial *Frobenius normal form *Jordan normal form, up to a permutation of the Jordan blocks *Index of nilpotence *Elementary divisors, which form a complete set of invariants for similarity of matrices over a principal ideal domain Because of this, for a given matrix A, one is interested in finding a simple \\"normal form\\" B which is similar to A‚Äîthe study of A then reduces to the study of the simpler matrix B. For example, A is called diagonalizable if it is similar to a diagonal matrix. Not all matrices are diagonalizable, but at least over the complex numbers (or any algebraically closed field), every matrix is similar to a matrix in Jordan form. Neither of these forms is unique (diagonal entries or Jordan blocks may be permuted) so they are not really normal forms; moreover their determination depends on being able to factor the minimal or characteristic polynomial of A (equivalently to find its eigenvalues). The rational canonical form does not have these drawbacks: it exists over any field, is truly unique, and it can be computed using only arithmetic operations in the field; A and B are similar if and only if they have the same rational canonical form. The rational canonical form is determined by the elementary divisors of A; these can be immediately read off from a matrix in Jordan form, but they can also be determined directly for any matrix by computing the Smith normal form, over the ring of polynomials, of the matrix (with polynomial entries) (the same one whose determinant defines the characteristic polynomial). Note that this Smith normal form is not a normal form of A itself; moreover it is not similar to either, but obtained from the latter by left and right multiplications by different invertible matrices (with polynomial entries). Similarity of matrices does not depend on the base field: if L is a field containing K as a subfield, and A and B are two matrices over K, then A and B are similar as matrices over K if and only if they are similar as matrices over L. This is so because the rational canonical form over K is also the rational canonical form over L. This means that one may use Jordan forms that only exist over a larger field to determine whether the given matrices are similar. In the definition of similarity, if the matrix P can be chosen to be a permutation matrix then A and B are permutation-similar; if P can be chosen to be a unitary matrix then A and B are unitarily equivalent. The spectral theorem says that every normal matrix is unitarily equivalent to some diagonal matrix. Specht's theorem states that two matrices are unitarily equivalent if and only if they satisfy certain trace equalities.

Crunk is often up-tempo and one of Southern hip hop's more dance and club oriented subgenres. An archetypal crunk track frequently uses a main groove consisting of layered keyboard synths, a drum machine clapping rhythm, heavy basslines, and shouting vocals, often in a call and response manner. The term \\"crunk\\" is also used as a blanket term to denote any style of Southern hip hop, a side effect of the genre's breakthrough to the mainstream. The word derives from its African- American slang past-participle form, \\"crunk\\", of the verb \\"to crank\\" (as in the phrase \\"crank up\\"). It refers to being excited or high on drugs.crunk at dictionary.com Etymology The term has been attributed mainly to African- American slang, in which it holds various meanings.Oxford English Dictionary It most commonly refers to the verb phrase \\"to crank up\\". It is theorized that the use of the term came from a past-tense form of \\"crank\\", which was sometimes conjugated as \\"crunk\\" in the South, such that if a person, event, or party was hyped-up, i.e. energetic - \\"cranked\\" or \\"cranked up\\" - it was said to be \\"crunk\\". In publications, \\"crunk\\" can be traced back to 1972 in the Dr. Seuss book Marvin K. Mooney Will You Please Go Now!. He uses the term \\"Crunk- Car\\" without any given definition. The term has also been traced to usage in the 1980s coming out of Atlanta, Georgia nightclubs and meaning being \\"full of energy\\" or \\"hyped\\". In the mid-1990s, crunk was variously defined either as \\"hype\\", \\"phat\\", or \\"pumped up\\". Rolling Stone magazine published \\"glossary of Dirty South slang\\", where to crunk was defined as \\"to get excited\\". Outkast has been attributed as the first artist to use the term in mainstream music, in the 1993 track \\"Player's Ball\\". A seminal year for the genre was 1996, with the releases of Three 6 Mafia album Chapter 1: The End (featuring \\"Gette'm Crunk\\"), and Memphis-based underground hip hop artist Tommy Wright III's album On the Run, which featured the Project Pimp track \\"Getting Crunk\\". Artist Lil Jon was instrumental in bringing the term further into the mainstream with his 1997 album titled Get Crunk, Who U Wit: Da Album. He later released other songs and albums using the term, and has been credited by other artists and musicians as galvanizing use of the term as well as mainstreaming the music genre itself. Lil Jon further popularized the word with his 2004 album Crunk Juice, and has been credited with inventing the potent alcoholic cocktail by that name. This use of \\"crunk\\" became synonymous with the meaning \\"crazy drunk\\". Non-alcoholic drinks, to which alcohol could be added, were manufactured and marketed under the Crunk brand name, with Lil Jon as spokesman. The term has continued to evolve, taking on a negative stigma with police, parents and the media. In 2011, the company which manufactured \\"Crunk\\" drink brought out an alcoholic version named \\"Crunk Juice\\". This drink was allegedly marketed towards 19- to 21-year-olds ‚Äì those under the US legal drinking age ‚Äì resulting in Crunk Juice drinking being blamed as a cause of crime or becoming a victim of crime. The mainstream media began publishing stories in which the term \\"crunk\\" was used to refer to \\"crazy and drunk\\" criminals. Musical characteristics Musically, crunk borrows heavily from Miami bass and 1980s-era call-and-response hip hop. Heavy use of synthesized instruments and sparse, truncated 808 handclaps are staples of the crunk sound. Looped, stripped-down drum machine rhythms are usually used. The Roland TR-808 and 909 are among the most popular. The drum machines are usually accompanied by simple, repeated synthesizer melodies in the form of ostinato, to create a hypnotic effect, and heavy bass stabs. The tempo of the music is somewhat slower than hip hop, around the speed of reggaeton. The focal point of crunk is more often the beats and music than the lyrics therein. Crunk rappers, such as Lil Jon, however, often shout and scream their lyrics, creating a heavy, aggressive style of hip hop. These lyrics can often be isolated to simple chants (\\"Where you from?\\" and \\"You can't fuck with me\\" are common examples). While other subgenres of hip hop address sociopolitical or personal concerns, crunk is almost exclusively party music, favoring call and response slogans in lieu of more substantive approaches. History =Origins= Lil Jon is one of crunk's most prominent figures. Crunk music arose from Miami bass music before 1996 in the southern United States, particularly in African American strip clubs of Memphis, Tennessee. Memphis- based hip hop group Three 6 Mafia were \\"instrumental for the emergence of the crunk style\\" in the mid-to-late 1990s. Two mixtape DJs from Memphis, DJ Paul and Juicy J, started making their original music, which was distinctive with its \\"spare, low-BPM rhythms, simplistic chants... and narcotically repetitive, slasher-flick textures\\". This duo soon became known as Three 6 Mafia. Frequently featuring rappers such as Project Pat, Lord Infamous, and Gangsta Boo on their releases, they became instrumental in the formation of crunk music. In 1997, in Atlanta, Lil Jon, with his group The East Side Boyz, released their first album titled Get Crunk, Who U Wit. These were the first of six albums released by Lil Jon and The East Side Boyz. Lil Jon states that they were first to use the word \\"crunk\\" in a song hook; he claimed that they had started to call themselves a \\"crunk group\\" due to this album. However, The New York Times denied that Get Crunk, Who Are You With was the first crunk album ever. He was one of the key figures in popularizing crunk during 1998 and 1999, and produced two gold records independently, before signing to TVT Records in 2001. After being named the \\"King of Crunk\\", Lil Jon went on to make collaborations with many popular artist such as Snoop Dogg, Ice Cube, Ludacris and Britney Spears. Nevertheless, crunk was not exclusively associated with Lil Jon and Three 6 Mafia. In its early stages, such artists as Ying Yang Twins, White Dawg, Bone Crusher, Lil Scrappy, Trillville, Youngbloodz and Pastor Troy from Atlanta, and David Banner from Mississippi also helped to popularize crunk music. =Popularity and evolution= In the early to mid-2000s, some crunk music hits like \\"Get Low\\", \\"Goodies\\", \\"Yeah!\\", and \\"Freek-a-Leek\\" produced by Lil Jon climbed to the Top 10 of the Billboard Hot 100 charts. Other hits produced by Lil Jon included \\"Okay\\", \\"Cyclone\\", \\"Girlfight\\", \\"U and Dat\\", and \\"Touch\\". \\"Yeah!\\" and \\"Goodies\\" were the first tracks to introduce the substyle of crunk music and contemporary R&B;, called crunk&B;, to the public. Those two tracks (performed by Usher and Ciara, respectively) were mainstream hits of 2004. Since then, crunk&B; has been one of the most popular genres of sung African-American music, along with electropop, the genre that replaced crunk and crunk&B; in the charts by 2008. The song \\"Get Low\\" (2003), performed by Lil Jon & the East Side Boyz with the Ying Yang Twins, is credited as the track which put crunk music into the national spotlight. \\"Get Low\\" reached the number two position on the Billboard Hot 100 music chart; overall, it spent more than 21 weeks in the charts. Though rappers not from Dixie had tended to avoid being associated with Southern hip hop music before, Busta Rhymes and Nelly accepted offers to perform on remixes of \\"Get Low\\". Lil Jon's album, titled Kings of Crunk, which contains \\"Get Low\\", became double platinum. In 2004, independent label Crunk Incorporated signed a major distribution deal with Reprise/Warner Brothers Records for the crunk group Crime Mob, who released the platinum single \\"Knuck If You Buck\\". They followed this with their 2006 hit, \\"Rock Yo Hips\\". In March 2004, R&B; singer Houston released his crunk&B; hit \\"I Like That\\", which reached number 11 on the Billboard Hot 100. In 2005, crunk&B; reached the Billboard Hot 100 number one position with the song \\"Run It!\\", performed by Chris Brown. In 2005 and 2006, crunk and crunk&B; conquered the American R&B; charts (and other charts specializing in music with rapping) and replaced hip hop and older styles of contemporary R&B.; Atlanta R&B; group Cherish also gained prominence with their summer 2006 song \\"Do It to It\\" where the song debuted at number 86 on the Billboard Hot 100 for the week of May 20, 2006, later peaking at number 12 for the week of September 2, 2006 and staying on the charts for 21 weeks. The growing interest in crunk music among music producers outside the Southern hip hop scene led to the development of various subgenres of crunk, including Eurocrunk, crunkcore, crunkczar, aquacrunk, acid crunk and most recently, trap music. By the end of 2009, crunk has seen a relative decline in mainstream American music, mostly due to the rising popularity of the trap and drill music subgenres during the 2010s. In 2015, American singer Tinashe incorporated crunk elements in her single \\"All Hands on Deck\\" featuring Iggy Azalea. The song contains themes of girl power and self empowerment. In 2019, rapper Saweetie sampled Petey Pablo's 2004 crunk hit \\"Freek-a-Leek\\" for her song \\"My Type\\".

Background Two T-38 Talon chase planes follow Space Shuttle Columbia as it lands at Northrop Strip in White Sands, New Mexico, ending its mission STS-3. Safety can be one function of a chase plane; others are to photograph or video the target vehicle, or to collect engineering data from it. Chase planes may be used during flight tests, and for many years the best way to ensure the safety of an experimental aircraft was to fly alongside it and observe the flight. This \\"chase\\" airplane's crew would keep a constant lookout for problems with the \\"subject\\" or test aircraft, and if problems did arise, they would provide warnings and critical information to the test aircraft's crew, and to the mission controllers on the ground. They would also monitor the surrounding airspace for other aircraft that could pose a hazard to the flight, either by straying into their flightpath or threatening any kind of secrecy associated with that particular project. Since the early days of United States Air Force testing, the chase aircraft have been manned by test pilots just like the experimental planes they accompany, providing a common language and bond between test pilot and observer. The experienced pilots in the chase aircraft could guide distressed test aircraft down to safe landings should experiments go wrong.

It is the largest known extant species of skink. The Solomon Islands skink is completely herbivorous, eating many different fruits and vegetables including the pothos plant. It is one of the few species of reptile known to function within a social group or circulus. Both male and female specimens are known to be territorial and often hostile towards members not a part of their family group. Corucia is a monotypic genus, containing a single species. However, in 1997 it was determined that there are two subspecies of the Solomon Islands skink: the common monkey-tailed skink (Corucia zebrata zebrata) and the northern monkey-tailed skink (Corucia zebrata alfredschmidti). Among other variances, the northern skink is smaller and has darker eyes with a black sclera. Extensive logging is a serious threat to the survival of this species. Consumption for food by indigenous Solomon Islanders and excessive pet trade exports have affected wild populations. Export of this species from the Solomon Islands is now restricted and the animal is protected under CITES appendix II. Taxonomy and etymology The Solomon Islands skink was first described by John Edward Gray in 1855 as Corucia zebrata. The generic name Corucia derives from the Latin word coruscus meaning \\"shimmering\\". This is in reference to Gray's description of \\"a play of colors effect from the body scales\\". Its specific name zebrata is a Latinized form of the word zebra, in reference to the animal's zebra-like stripes. Some of its common names (prehensile-tailed skink, monkey-tailed skink, monkey skink) refer to its fully prehensile tail which the species uses as a fifth limb for climbing. Although appearances of Solomon Island skinks vary from island to island, only one subspecies, from the western islands of the Solomons Archipelago, was described by Dr. Gunther K√∂hler in 1996 as C. z. alfredschmidti, the trinomial name of which is in honor of German amateur herpetologist Alfred A. Schmidt. (in German).Alfred A. Schmidt ‚Äì unser ‚ÄûGr√ºndungsvater\\"! The closest living relatives of C. zebrata are the blue-tongued skinks of the genus Tiliqua and skinks of the genus Egernia of Australia, New Guinea, and Indonesia, all of which are also assigned to the subfamily Lygosominae. Distribution and habitat Map of the Solomon Islands archipelago The Solomon Islands skink is native to Solomon Islands archipelago, a group of islands in the south-west Pacific Ocean. The common subspecies (C. z. zebrata) is found on the islands of Choiseul Island, New Georgia, Isabel, Guadalcanal, Ngela, Malaita, Makira (Solomon Islands), Ugi and Santa Ana. The northern subspecies (C. z. alfredschmidti) is known from the islands of Bougainville and Buka and the Shortland Island Group. Bougainville and Buka are geographically part of the Solomons Archipelago, though politically part of Papua New Guinea. Both subspecies of the Solomon Islands skink are strictly arboreal, usually inhabiting the upper canopy of forested areas throughout its range. It commonly occurs in the strangler fig tree (Ficus sp.), provided the epiphytic growth of its several food plants are present. It occurs in trees in semi- cleared areas and cultivated food gardens, again provided its food plants occur there. Biology Solomon Islands skink at the St Louis Zoo. The Solomon Islands skink is the world's largest species of extant skink; adults can reach a length of from nose to the tip of their tail when fully grown, with the tail accounting for more than half this length. The Solomon Islands skink has a long, slender body, strong, short legs, and a triangular shaped head with small round eyes. The skink has a strong crushing jaw but the teeth are small and used for eating plant material. Its prehensile tail helps it maneuver from branch to branch with ease and gives the skink its more common names: monkey-tailed skink, prehensile-tailed skink, or monkey skink. Male Solomon Islands skinks tend to have a broader head and a more slender body shape than do female skinks. Males have a V-shaped pattern of scales just aft of the cloacal opening, which is not present in female skinks. The scales of Solomon Islands skinks are a dark green but are often speckled with light brown or black. The scales on the underside vary from light yellow to different shades of green. The toes on all four legs have thick, curved nails used for climbing and gripping tree limbs. As a crepuscular animal, it is most active during the dusk and dawn hours, feeding primarily at dusk. it also is active and eats during the hours of dawn, though to a lesser extent. It has quite good eyesight and relies upon it to identify threats, as well as potential food. It relies heavily on its sense of smell and uses it to identify its territory and other members of its group, called a circulus. Like snakes, the skink \\"smells\\" by flicking its tongue to gather scents and when the tongue is retracted, it touches it to the opening of a Jacobson's organ at the roof of its mouth. = Subspecies = The common Solomon Islands skink (C. z. zebrata) has a white sclera with its eyes while the northern Solomon Islands skink (C. z. alfredschmidti) has a black sclera. The iris of the northern Solomon Islands skink is a mix of green and yellow whereas the iris of the common Solomon Islands skink can vary from several different shades of green to orange to a dark black. According to Dr. Gunther K√∂hler, who described the northern subspecies, this subspecies possesses \\"larger dorsal and ventral scales\\" and has \\"seven instead of usually five parietal scales\\". The northern Solomon Islands skink is the shorter of the two subspecies with males averaging and females averaging in length when measured from nose to tip of tail. The common Solomon Islands skinks are slightly longer with the males averaging and the females averaging when measured from nose to tip of tail. The common Solomon Islands skink, at , weighs more than the northern Solomon Islands skink, which weighs closer to . =Diet= Solomon Islands skinks are herbivores, feeding on the leaves, flowers, fruit, and growing shoots of several different species of plants. This includes the somewhat toxic (due to high concentrations of calcium oxalate) Epipremnum pinnatum (cf. E. aureum) plant, which the lizard eats without ill-effect. Juvenile skinks often eat feces from adults in order to acquire the essential microflora to digest their food. Newborn skinks have been observed consuming their placental sac after birth and will not feed on other food for the first two days. =Reproduction= The Solomon Islands skink is one of the few species of reptile that lives in a communal group known as a circulus. The Solomon Islands skink reproduces by viviparous matrotrophy: the female provides a placenta for its young, which are born after a gestation period of six to eight months; this is a rare trait among reptiles. The newborn skink is of a large size compared to its mother; the northern Solomon Islands skinks are approximately in length and weigh , whereas the common Solomon Islands skinks are and when they are born. This reduced size disparity led the former curator of reptiles at the Philadelphia Zoo, Dr. Kevin Wright, to compare it to \\"a human mother giving birth to a six year‚Äìold\\". Almost all births are single babies but occasionally twins will be born. At least one instance of triplets has occurred according to herpetologist Bert Langerwerf. The newborn skink will stay within its circulus for six to twelve months during which time it will be protected by not only its parents but other unrelated adult skinks within the group. Around one year of age, sometimes earlier, the juvenile will move off to form a new family group. Individuals have been documented to stay within the group for several births without being expelled, however. Females exhibit fierce protective behavior around the time of birth; this protectiveness of young is a rare occurrence in reptiles but is shorter in duration when compared to the protective behavior exhibited by a typical mammal. Conservation =Threats= Extensive logging is a serious ongoing threat to the survival of this species, as is consumption for food by native people, and export demand for the pet trade. Because of the large numbers of lizards that were being exported for the pet trade, the small region to which the skink is native, and its low reproductive rate, in 1992 Corucia zebrata was listed as a CITES Appendix II animal, which allows limits to be placed on the number of animals in commercial trade between countries. Since there is no regulation on the rapid deforestation occurring in the Solomon Islands, limited export to recognized institutions may be needed to aid this species in genetic diversity for its survival via ex situ breeding programs. According to herpetologists who study the Solomon Islands skink, such as Dr. David Kirkpatrick and the late Dr. Kevin Wright, captive breeding alone is not practical as a sole method of species survival due to the limited number of offspring and long gestation periods. =In captivity= Solomon Islands skink at the Buffalo Zoo. The Solomon Islands skink is represented in both public and private collections. The Philadelphia Zoo has bred these skinks over multiple generations for the past 40 years. The keeping of the Solomon Islands skink in captivity is not without its challenges: as it is a large arboreal tropical animal. It requires a large arboreal enclosure, with a constant temperature between 75‚Äì80 degrees Fahrenheit, with heat being provided from above as well as below, allowing the skink to bask in the heat from above as it would during dusk, while providing a radiant heat from below to aid digestion. The dynamics of the skink's circulus means that not all groups do well when new animals are introduced. Despite successful breeding programs, their somewhat unusual nature of single births and slow growth has made these programs challenging. A well-cared for monkey-tailed skink can live twenty- five to thirty years. A well-balanced diet consisting primarily of kale, green beans, and cooked sweet potato, supplemented with slices of peeled kiwi fruit, apple, and papaya, as well as access to a large shallow, clean water source aid in increasing longevity. Bathing them in shallow lukewarm water during the beginning of the monthly shed, greatly reduces the stress inherent in shedding, as well as speeds the process. Biologist Michael Balsai of Temple University has noted a significant number of breedings between skinks from different islands has resulted in non-productive unions. Balsai's theory is that there are enough differences between animals from different islands that pairing of lizards from different locales will be unproductive, further frustrating many captive breeding attempts.

(HTML abstract) Cryptoblepharus species, some of which are often seen in urban environments, are commonly named as fence skinks, or by characteristics such as their lack of eyelids, snake-eyed skinks, or as shining-skinks for their glossy skins.  Description  A genus of Scincidae, small bodied species that lack eyelids, are pentadactyl, and have shiny scales. They are able to move rapidly and with great agility, snatching insects from the air and climbing vertical surfaces with ease. They are often observed basking in the sun and disappearing to a hole or crevice in response to a perceived threat. Females may share an site to deposit their eggs, the species returning annually to lay a small clutch. There are a large number of species, with a distribution range across many continents; they are the most widespread genus of the scincid family. Species are found at the east coast of Africa and on Madagascar in a western Indian Ocean range that is isolated from the species found in a region that includes Australia, Indonesia, New Guinea and the Pacific area. Outlying from the Pacific region are species found at three areas on the west coast of South America. The species are often associated with vertical, often rocky microhabitats and other niches, foraging and residing on surfaces that lack available water. Cliffs and rocks are typical abodes, sandstone near shorelines in a common habitat for some species, as well as trees in forest environments, and they are known to occur at ground level to forage or commute to another location or in environments that lack this habitat. The species may be locally common to abundant, in numbers up to twenty or thirty at a cliff, rock pile or other favoured site. All species are oviparous, each female laying several eggs, and sexes are strongly dimorphic, the female distinguished by larger overall size with proportionally shorter head and legs. Detailed aspects of the reproduction activity are poorly known, especially the secretive manner in which the female places the eggs. Several sites of Cryptoblepharus species have been located, the include within the inner chambers of ant plants in New Guinea, ant inhabited species of Rubiaceae which also contained the broods of several females. The ability to occupy vertical environs is favoured by the fences and brick walls of urbanisation, where clusters of eggs have also occasionally been discovered within the cavities, and glimpses of them basking in the sun are frequently made before they rapidly flee any disturbance. When seen on a tree, the arboreal species will continually circle to the opposite side to evade a possible threat. Feeding is probably opportunistic, any arthropod that is small enough to consume, which is known to include spiders, ants and termites. Trails of winged ants have been observed as feeding opportunities, and some species are recorded seizing dead insects being carried by a line of worker ants. Juvenile fish are also known to be eaten. These skink are a source of food to a number of predators, but which species are able to capture them is also poorly surveyed. An individual has been observed as prey to a centipede, albeit when both were trapped (C. cygnatus), and they are a known prey item of other lizards, such as the pygopod Lialis burtonis. Cryptoblepharus metallicus, metallic snake-eyed skink A revision of Australasian species, published in two papers in 2007, compared morphological and molecular phylogenies and concluded that there was unrecognised diversity within the genus. The author, Paul Horner of the Northern Territory Museum, published revised systematics that sampled widely distributed populations in the Australian region, with small samples of taxa from other regions, to identify twenty five taxa in Australia, another thirteen in the southwest of the Indian oceanic area, and a further twenty four in the Indo-Pacific, listing 62 taxonomic descriptions of the genus in total.

Ctenotus lizards are able to move very quickly, disappearing whilst being observed. They are highly active in their habits, foraging amongst a diverse range of habitat. The members of the genus Ctenotus are widely distributed, in all states of Australia, and are especially diverse in arid regions and the tropical north, accounting for 10‚Äì20% of the lizard species. Around a quarter of lizards found in one area of the Great Sandy Desert are Ctenotus skinks, 11 of the 40 species. A single dune may have up to six species of Ctenotus. The Southwest Australian region contains 23 species. The size ranges from very small to moderately large, being similarly varied in body types from slender to stout. The diversity of forms allows species to occupy different niches, often in the same locality. Species Ctenotus is the most diverse reptile genus in Australia, with approximately 100 member species.

History Map of Welsh cantrefs The Treaty of Montgomery was signed on 29 September 1267, in the town of Montgomery, which had recently been established as an English incursion on the Welsh side of the border, to control a strategic border crossing. The surrounding region (on the Welsh side of the border) otherwise comprised the mediaeval principality of Powys Wenwynwyn, the southern of the two states into which the Kingdom of Powys had been divided a century before. Attacks by Gwynedd on Powys Wenwynwyn led the latter to seek the assistance of the English. Ultimately this led them to convert their territory into a marcher lordship, via surrender and regrant, as a way to strengthen their position; the ruling princes of Powys Wenwynwyn became the Lords of Powys, feudally bound to the English king, and able to fully rely on English backing, but otherwise independent. The prince took an English-style surname - Owen de-la Pole - after his capital city, Pool (now Welshpool). With the introduction of the Laws in Wales Acts 1535‚Äì1542 the marcher lordships were converted into English counties. The Lordship of Powys - the former Powys Wenwynwyn - became Montgomeryshire; the county town being Montgomery, the strongest centre of English authority in the region, rather than centre of Welsh authority, Welshpool. Montgomeryshire was thus ultimately formed from the cantrefi of Powys Wenwynwyn: * Y Fyrnwy (commotes of Mochnant Uwch Rhaeadr, Mechain Is Coed and Llanerch Hudol) * Llyswynaf (commotes of Caereinion and Mechain Uwch Coed) * Ystlyg (commotes of Deuddwr, Ystrad Marchell and Y Gorddwr Isaf) * Cedewain (commotes of Cynan, Cyfeiliog and Mawddwy) * Arwystli (commotes of Arwystli Is Coed and Arwystli Uwch Coed) In addition, for practical reasons, Montgomeryshire gained the commote of Ceri, which had formed a northwards spur of the less organised Region Between the Wye and Severn; most of the rest of the latter region became Radnorshire. Montgomeryshire was bordered, to the north, by Denbighshire, to the east and south east by Shropshire, to the south by Radnorshire, to the south west by Cardiganshire, and to the west and north west by Merionethshire. When, in subsequent centuries, the concept of Wales was once again officially distinguished from England, all of these counties were deemed Welsh, except for Shropshire. Montgomeryshire was the birthplace of Welsh Catholic martyr Saint Richard Gwyn (in 1537). =Local government= From 1889 to 1974 the county became an administrative county with a county council. Montgomery, the traditional county town, held the assizes and became the meeting place of the new County Council.Wynford Vaughan-Thomas and Alun Llewelyn, The Shell Guide to Wales (Michael Joseph, London, 1974) p. 339 However, the administration continued to be based at Welshpool,Vaughan-Thomas and Llewelyn, p. 339 which prior to the reforms had been regarded as the county town.National Gazetteer of Wales, 1868. Local government reforms in 1974 combined the administrative areas of Montgomeryshire, Radnorshire and Breconshire together to form a new administrative Powys county. Montgomeryshire became a district of Powys, with its administrative headquarters in Newtown (and not Montgomery). Further local government reform in 1996 abolished district councils in Wales, making Powys a unitary authority. The Montgomeryshire area continued to have an administrative/political function as one of the three committee areas used by Powys Council to denote Powys's three historic counties (Montgomeryshire; Radnorshire and Breconshire), but these were abolished in 2018. In September 2019, The Brexit Party announced they would hold a referendum on restoring a County Council for Montgomeryshire, were they to enter Government in the Welsh Assembly. This would result in Montgomeryshire leaving Powys, and Powys being re-named Brecon and Radnor Council. The few communities that were added to northern Powys in 1996 (which come within the historic boundaries of Denbighshire) now form part of the modern-day Montgomeryshire area. =Electoral representation= Montgomeryshire is a UK Parliament constituency and a Welsh Assembly constituency. Geography The shire is almost wholly mountainous, although there are some fertile valleys in the east. The highest point (county top) is Moel Sych at , whose summit lies at the triple county boundary point of Montgomeryshire, Denbighshire and Merionethshire in the Berwyn Mountains. The county top of Denbighshire, Cadair Berwyn at , is less than a kilometre away. Its main rivers are the River Severn (which flows east into Shropshire) and the River Dyfi (which flows west into the Irish Sea). Lake Vyrnwy is a reservoir supplying Liverpool. The main towns are Machynlleth, Llanidloes, Montgomery, Newtown and Welshpool. The main industries are agriculture (mainly hill farming) and tourism, though there is also some forestry and light manufacturing. The population density is highest near the border with England and along the Severn valley. The county is closely linked to Shropshire, with many essential services for Montgomeryshire residents being located in the more densely populated town of Shrewsbury, such as acute health services at the Royal Shrewsbury Hospital. The county flower of Montgomeryshire is Spergula arvensis (also called \\"corn spurrey\\"). The shire forms a vice-county for wildlife recording. Transport Montgomeryshire is crossed from East to West by the Cambrian Line, a mainline passenger railway which runs between Shrewsbury and Aberystwyth as well as Pwllheli with stations at Welshpool, Newtown, Caersws and Machynlleth. As of 2018 services are provided by Transport for Wales. The Welshpool and Llanfair Light Railway links Welshpool to Llanfair Caereinion. =Places of special interest= *Bryntail lead mine buildings near Llanidloes *Centre for Alternative Technology at Llwyngwern near Machynlleth *The Museum of Modern Art, Wales (MOMA) in Machynlleth *Dolforwyn Castle near Abermule *Montgomery Castle in Montgomery *The Old Bell Museum in Montgomery *Powis Castle near Welshpool * The Robert Owen Museum in Newtown *Trefeglwys Tumuli *Mathrafal ‚Äî the seat of the Welsh kings and princes of Powys *Meifod *Offa's Dyke  Politics  Montgomeryshire is represented in the following constituencies: * Montgomeryshire (UK Parliament constituency), a constituency of the House of Commons of the Parliament of the United Kingdom * Montgomeryshire (Assembly constituency), a constituency of the National Assembly for Wales See also *Townships in Montgomeryshire *Local government in Wales *History of Wales **History of local government in Wales *List of Lord Lieutenants of Montgomeryshire *List of High Sheriffs of Montgomeryshire References External links *Map of Montgomeryshire on Wikishire Category:Historic counties of Wales Category:States and territories established in 1535 Category:1535 establishments in England ","title":"Montgomeryshire"},{"id":"341181","text":"Cyclodomorphus is a genus of small to medium-sized skinks (family Scincidae).\\"Cyclodomorphus \\".

He was known for playing Lee Chan, the \\"Number One Son\\" in the Charlie Chan films, the original Kato in the 1939‚Äì1941 Green Hornet film serials, Brak in the 1960s Space Ghost cartoons, Master Po in the television series Kung Fu, and Mr. Wing in the Gremlins films. He was the first Chinese-American contract player signed by RKO, Universal Pictures and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer and was one of the most prominent Asian actors of American cinema in the mid-20th century. Early life Luke was born in Guangzhou, China, to a father who owned an art shop, but grew up in Seattle. He was part of the Luke family, a relative of Washington assistant attorney-general Wing Luke, for whom Seattle's Wing Luke Asian Museum was named. He had four siblings who all emigrated from China to California during the Great Depression. His younger brother Edwin Luke also became an actor in the Charlie Chan series. In Seattle, Luke attended Franklin High School, where he contributed cartoons and illustrations to school publications. Keye Luke became a naturalized citizen of the United States in 1944‚Äîin a moment fictionally recreated in Lisa See's novel Shanghai Girls. Artist Before becoming an actor he was a local artist in Seattle and, later, Hollywood, working on several of the murals inside Grauman's Chinese Theatre. He did some of the original artwork for the 1933 King Kong pressbook. Luke also painted the casino's mural in The Shanghai Gesture. He published a limited edition set of pen and ink drawings of The Rubiyat of Omar Khayyam in the 1950s. He also created illustrations for the books The Unfinished Song of Achmed Mohammed by Earle Liederman, Blessed Mother Goose by Frank Scully and an edition of Messer Marco Polo by Brian Oswald Donn-Byrne (unpublished). Other art done by Luke included the dust jackets for books published in the 1950s and 1960s. It was through his studio art work that he was recruited for his first movie roles. Acting career Luke made his film debut in The Painted Veil (1934), and the following year gained his first big role, as Charlie Chan's eldest son, Lee Chan, in Charlie Chan in Paris. He worked so well with Warner Oland, the actor playing Chan, that \\"Number One Son\\" became a regular character in the series, alternately helping and distracting 'Pop' Chan in each of his murder cases. Regardless, Lee is depicted as an enthusiastic American youth of some accomplishment, including becoming an Olympic Gold Medalist in 100-metre swimming in Charlie Chan at the OlympicsBerlin, Howard M. \\"The Who's Who of Charlie Chan's Family\\" Luke appeared seven times as Lee Chan opposite Oland's Chan. Keye Luke left the Charlie Chan series in 1938, shortly after Oland died. The unfinished Oland-Luke film Charlie Chan at the Ringside was completed as Mr. Moto's Gamble, with Luke now opposite Peter Lorre. Unlike some performers who failed to establish themselves beyond a single role, Keye Luke continued to work prolifically in Hollywood, at several studios. Metro- Goldwyn-Mayer cast him in a recurring role in its Dr. Kildare film series, and Monogram Pictures featured him in its Frankie Darro comedies and starred him as Mr. Wong in Phantom of Chinatown. Unlike Boris Karloff, who had preceded him in the Mr. Wong role, Luke played the detective without any exotic touches. Though his Mr. Wong was of Chinese descent and able to speak Chinese, he was otherwise an ordinary American gumshoe, with no trace of a foreign accent or \\"Oriental\\" philosophy. RKO Radio Pictures used Luke in its popular adventures of The Falcon and Mexican Spitfire. Luke also worked at Universal Pictures, where he played two-fisted valet/chauffeur Kato in its Green Hornet serials. In 1946 Universal mounted a low-budget serial consisting largely of action footage from older films; Keye Luke was hired to match old footage of Sabu in the serial Lost City of the Jungle. In 1948, Keye Luke returned to the Chan mysteries, which were now being produced by Monogram and starred Roland Winters as Chan. \\"Number One Son\\" appeared in the last two Chan features, The Feathered Serpent along with \\"Number Two Son\\" Tommy Chan (Victor Sen Yung) in their only appearance together, and Sky Dragon. In both of these films, Luke was older than the actor playing his father. Luke had a featured Broadway role in the Rodgers and Hammerstein musical Flower Drum Song, directed by Gene Kelly in 1958. The soundtrack album captures his singing of the part of Mr. Wang, the family patriarch. Luke continued to play character parts in motion pictures. He had a featured role in The Chairman (1969) starring Gregory Peck. He provided the voice of the evil Mr. Han in Enter the Dragon (1973) starring Bruce Lee. Luke played the mysterious old Chinatown shopowner Mr. Wing in the two Gremlins movies and he had a significant role in Woody Allen's 1990 movie Alice. Keye Luke also worked extensively in television, making numerous guest appearances, including four on The F.B.I. and seven TV movies. He was a regular cast member in two short lived sitcoms, Anna and the King (1972) starring Yul Brynner and Sidekicks (1986‚Äì87). \\"Number One Son\\" ascended to the role of Charlie Chan himself, thus becoming the first actor of Chinese descent to play the role: he supplied the voice of \\"Mr. Chan\\" in the animated television series The Amazing Chan and the Chan Clan (1972). Kung Fu He was also known for his role of Master Po in the television series Kung Fu (1972‚Äì75). In 1985, Luke played 'The Ancient One' on the soap opera General Hospital, for the Asian Quarter storyline, which showcased strong chemistry between Luke and young actress Kimberly McCullough, whom he mentored. In 1986, Luke appeared in season two of \\"The Golden Girls\\" as Sophia's love interest. Additionally Luke voiced many animated series including Brak in Space Ghost, the aforementioned Charlie Chan, and Zoltar/The Great Spirit/Colonel Cronus in Battle of the Planets. Keye Luke (1976) Luke played Governor Donald Cory in an episode of the original Star Trek entitled \\"Whom Gods Destroy\\" (1969), and was going to play Doctor Noonien Soong in the Star Trek: The Next Generation episode \\"Brothers\\" but illness prevented him from doing so; Brent Spiner ultimately took over the role. In the Fractured Fairy Tales episode \\"The Enchanted Fly,\\" one of the rewards offered to the man who would rescue and marry the princess is \\"an autographed picture of Keye Luke.\\" Honours He was awarded the Lifetime Achievement Award by Asian/Pacific American Artists in 1986. For his contribution to show business, Luke was also honored with a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, on the sidewalk in front of 7000 Hollywood Blvd. Death Luke died of a stroke on January 12, 1991, at the age of 86. He is buried at Rose Hills Memorial Park in Whittier, California. Legacy Writer and filmmaker Timothy Tau wrote, directed and produced a short film about Keye Luke's earlier life and work, entitled Keye Luke, which premiered at the 2012 Los Angeles Asian Pacific Film Festival as a Visual Communications Armed with a Camera Fellowship film. The film was also the Closing Night choice of the inaugural 2013 Seattle Asian American Film Festival. Feodor Chin starred as Keye Luke. Archie Kao starred as Edwin Luke, Keye Luke's brother. Kelvin Han Yee starred as Lee Luke, Keye Luke's father.

It is represented by the Radnorshire area of Powys, which according to the 2011 census, had a population of 25,821. The historic county was bounded to the north by Montgomeryshire and Shropshire, to the east by Herefordshire, to the south by Brecknockshire and to the west by Cardiganshire. The county was formed from the cantrefs of Maelienydd and Elfael and the commotes of Gwrtheyrnion and Deuddwr (the area formerly known as Rhwng Gwy a Hafren) by the Laws in Wales Acts 1535-1542. New Radnor was the original county town, although the Assizes sat at Presteigne and ultimately the County Council formed in 1889 met at Presteigne as well. Some administrative functions, and later the District Council, were based at the larger and more central Llandrindod Wells, which is currently the largest settlement. The administrative county formed under the Local Government Act 1888 was abolished by the Local Government Act 1972 in 1974, with its area forming the Radnor district of Powys.Local Government Act 1972 c.70 s.20 and 216 The district was renamed Radnorshire in 1989. Since Powys became a unitary authority in 1996, Radnorshire has been one of three areas formed under a decentralisation scheme. A \\"shire committee\\" consisting of councillors elected for electoral divisions within the former district of Radnorshire exercises functions delegated by Powys County Council. Geography In the east and south are some comparatively level tracts, including the Vale of Radnor, but much of the county is forest, moorland and low mountains, with the Cambrian Mountains running through the west of the county beyond Rhayader. The Radnor Forest is a slightly isolated dome of hills in the middle of the county near the village of New Radnor, and includes the highest ground in the county. Here is found the county top of Great Rhos, at a height of above sea level. The Elan Valley contains several huge man-made reservoirs supplying water to Birmingham. The main rivers are the Wye, the Teme, the Elan and the Ithon. The Teme forms the boundary with Shropshire. The chief towns are Knighton, Llandrindod Wells, Presteigne and Rhayader. The backbone of local incomes are tourism, hill farming and the public sector such as care, education and road/public land maintenance. Sheep, dairy/cattle and poultry farming provide more revenue than crops which like much of Scotland, the Pennines and Wales receive more than national average precipitation and can be subject to late frosts. Subdivisions =Hundreds= On the creation of the county it was divided into six hundreds. The names of the hundreds, which were not always consistently spelt, were as follows: *Colwyn *Cefnllys (Kevenlleece or Cevnll≈∑s) *Knighton *Painscastle *Radnor *Rhaiadr (or Rhayader) =Local government districts= Poor law unions In the 19th century new structures of local administration were introduced. The Poor Law Amendment Act 1834 grouped parishes into poor law unions. While these were not themselves local authorities, their boundaries were to later be used to define local government districts. PLUs did not conform to county boundaries, but consisted of catchment areas for workhouses. Most of Radnorshire was included in the three unions of Knighton, Presteigne and Rhayader. Parishes on the edges of the county were included in unions based in other counties: Builth and Hay on Wye in Brecknockshire and Kington in Herefordshire. Local boards of health There were no town councils in the county until 1850, when a local board was formed at Knighton. Similar bodies were later formed at Llandrindod Wells (originally named Trefonen) and Presteigne in 1891.Census of England and Wales 1901, County Report, Radnorshire Sanitary districts The Public Health Act 1875 divided England and Wales into sanitary districts, each governed by a sanitary authority. Instead of creating new bodies, existing local board districts became urban sanitary districts (USDs) and the remaining areas of poor law unions became rural sanitary districts (RSDs). The existing local board or poor law guardians became the sanitary authority for their area. By 1891 therefore, Radnorshire was divided between the following sanitary districts: *Builth RSD (part) *Hay RSD (part) *Kington RSD (Part) *Knighton RSD *Knighton USD *Llandrindod Wells USD *Presteigne RSD (dissolved in 1877, with parishes redistributed to Kington and Knighton RSDs) *Presteigne USD *Rhayader RSD Urban and rural districts Urban and rural districts of Radnorshire 1894 - 1974: a) Llandrindod Wells UD, b) Knighton UD, c) Presteigne UD, 1) Rhayader RD, 2) Knighton RD 3) New Radnor RD, 4) Colwyn RD, 5) Painscastle RDThe Local Government Act 1894 created urban districts (UDs) and rural districts (RDs) in place of the sanitary districts. Directly elected urban and rural district councils became the governing bodies. The new districts were identical to the sanitary districts, with the exception that where a RSD was divided by a county boundary it was split into separate rural district in each county. Radnorshire was divided into eight UDs and RDs, which were unchanged until their abolition in 1974: *Colwyn RD (from Builth RSD) *Knighton RD *Knighton UD *Llandrindod Wells UD *New Radnor RD (from Kington RSD) *Painscastle RD (from Hay RSD) *Presteigne UD *Rhayader RD Coat of arms Until 1954 Radnorshire County Council used a version of the arms of the Mortimers, Earls of March: Barry of six or and azure on a chief of the last two pallets azure between as may gyrons of the first.A C Fox-Davies, The Book of Public Arms, 2nd edition, London 1915Mary O'Regan, Heraldry of the Old Welsh Counties, Part 2, in Aspects of Heraldry, Vol.9, Yorkshire Heraldry Society, 1995 The council received a grant of armorial bearings by the College of Arms in 1954.Geoffrey Briggs, Civic and Corporate Heraldry, London, 1971 The arms were made up of charges from local families. A gold reguardant lion on red was for Elystan Glodrhydd, Prince of Wales c.1000; black boars' heads on white for his son Cadwgan. Around these was placed a gold and blue compony bordure based on the Mortimer arms. The motto adopted by the county council was ' (\\"Go Higher\\"). In 1974 the arms were transferred to Radnor District Council. In 1996 the arms were transferred a second time to Powys County Council, for use by the Radnorshire Shire Committee. History and culture The geographic territory of the historic county roughly corresponds with the Welsh territory of Rhwng Gwy a Hafren which fell under the control of the Marcher Lords at the end of the 11th Century. Radnorshire was a poor county and has been an historical backwater but occasionally has drifted to the forefront of history. The most notable historic events are the founding of Cwmhir Abbey and the Battle of Bryn Glas, fought on 22 June 1402 during the rebellion of Owain Glynd≈µr. The county's poverty was remarked upon thus in the 17th century by an anonymous visitor: Apart from a handful of parishes along the English border the Welsh language remained the first language of the county well into the second half of the eighteenth century.F G Payne, Crwydro Sir Faesyfed Vol I (1966) & Vol II (1968), Llandyb√Øe By 1850 the language had retreated to the western parishes of Rhayader, Llanyre, Cwmdauddwr, St Harmon and Nantmel. By 1900 Welsh was still spoken by a sizeable minority west of the town of Rhayader, the language disappearing as the century progressed. Of course there were Welsh speakers living in Radnorshire who had come from other parts of Wales and today their number has been swelled by children being educated through the medium of Welsh in school. Until the Acts of Union, Radnor was outside the Principality of Wales. This peculiar Marcher status and its want of Welsh speakers gave weight to the traditional local expression, \\"Neither Wales nor England, just Radnorsheer\\" The renowned 18th century artist Thomas Jones was born in the area, in Cefnllys, Radnorshire.

Radnor Young Farmers Club has 13 clubs throughout the county. It is affiliated to the National Federation of Young Farmers Clubs. The Radnorshire Museum website, in Llandrindod Wells, collects, preserves and interprets the rich cultural heritage of Radnorshire. This is reflected in its diverse collections of Geology, Palaeontology, Archaeology, Natural History, Social History and Fine Art. The Radnorshire Wildlife Trust manages 17 nature reserves across the county. The Llandrindod Wells Victorian Festival is held annually at the end of August. It offers open-air and street theatre and music, a fairground, craft fair, historical re-enactment, entertainments at the Albert Hall and exhibitions of old items. Notable people Eleanor Bufton (b.

These skinks are ecologically diverse omnivores that inhabit a wide range of habitats. However, in the loose delimitation (which incorporates about 30 species) the genus is not monophyletic but an evolutionary grade, as has long been suspected due to its lack of characteristic apomorphies. (2008). \\"Molecular systematics of social skinks: phylogeny and taxonomy of the Egernia group (Reptilia: Scincidae)\\". Zool. J. Linn. Soc. 154 (4): 781-794. (HTML abstract). Some of the skinks traditionally placed in Egernia appear to be among the most intelligent squamates. They have been shown to be able to distinguish between relatives and unrelated conspecifics, and can recognize relatives individually. Several species form monogamous pair-bonds. Most of these species belong to Egernia sensu stricto, and similar behaviour is also known in the related Solomon Islands skink (Corucia zebrata). The latter means that the high intelligence and social skills are probably plesiomorphic for the Egernia genus-group as a whole, and that the solitary species appear to have evolved towards being less intelligent and social again. It may still be, however, that the intelligent behaviour is a homoplasy that evolved several times in the Egernia genus-group; the fact that Corucia is a monotypic and rather distinct genus makes it impossible to decide at present. (2006). \\"Using ancient and recent DNA to explore relationships of extinct and endangered Leiolopisma skinks (Reptilia: Scincidae) in the Mascarene islands\\". Mol. Phylogenet. Evol. 39 (2): 503‚Äì511. (HTML abstract). Systematics, taxonomy and evolution It is the namesake genus of the Egernia genus-group, which also includes the Solomon Islands skink (Corucia), Cyclodomorphus and the blue-tongued skinks (Tiliqua). In some older works, it is considered closely related to Mabuya, but even among the subfamily Lygosominae this genus does not seem to be particularly closely related and would‚Äîwere the genus-groups treated at the rarely used rank of infrafamily‚Äîcertainly constitute an infrafamily of its own. On the other hand, the enigmatic crocodile skinks (Tribolonotus) might be a very basal member of the Egernia genus-group. The genus Egernia proper, as well as the other lineages, appear to be of Miocene‚Äîprobably Early Miocene‚Äîorigin, meaning they radiated at least 15, maybe 20 million years ago (mya). There are fossils of Egernia-like Lygosominae from around the Oligocene-Miocene boundary 23 mya, but these cannot be assigned to the present genus with certainty. Rather, they appear to be basal members of the Egernia genus-group, still very plesiomorphic Lygosominae with a habitus similar to Mabuya. Species Stokes's skink (E. stokesii) is a large species of the \\"typical\\" clade Mid-sized to large skinks (adult snout-vent length 100‚Äì240 mm) with a bulky, usually somewhat flattened body and small eyes. 24‚Äì46 rows of midbody scales; dorsal scales smooth, ridged, keeled or spiny (the tail is often notably spiny). The nasal scale has a postnarial groove; the subocular scale row is incomplete.

Systematics Recently two taxonomic revisions have been made regarding the 19th century genus Eumeces. They both resulted in similar results; the genus is paraphyletic and must be \\"sliced up\\" into several different genera. Griffith et al. (2000) proposed that the type species for Eumeces, E. pavimentatus, which is considered by many to be a subspecies of Eumeces schneiderii, should be changed to Lacerta fasciata, so that the genus name Eumeces would stay with the most species-rich clade. However, this petition has not been verified by the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature. Schimtz et al. argued that Griffith et al. violated the Code and rejected the proposal on good grounds. Thus only the African species of the Eumeces schneiderii group belong to the genus Eumeces.

It was named by Wagler in 1830 and frequently used in subsequent years, often misspelled as Euprepes, a misspelling introduced by Wiegmann in 1834. It was then subsumed under the large skink genus Mabuya, until Mausfeld and others resurrected it for a group of mainly African skinks they split from Mabuya. The following year, Bauer argued that this assignment had been in error and that this group should be called Trachylepis instead. Euprepis itself is a junior synonym of Mabuya.Bauer, 2003, p. 5 Type species The identity of the type species, the name-bearing type which determines the application of a generic name, of Euprepis has been in some recent dispute. In 1830, Wagler included several species in Euprepis: Lacerta punctata Linnaeus, 1758 (=Lygosoma punctatum),Bauer, 2003, p. 4 Scincus multifasciatus Kuhl, 1820, Scincus trilineatus Schneider, 1801, Scincus quinquetaeniatus Lichtenstein, 1823, Scincus agilis Raddi, 1823 (=Mabuya agilis),Bauer, 2003, p. 5 Lacerta fasciata Linnaeus, 1758, Lacerta quinquelineata Linnaeus, 1758, Scincus tristatus Daudin, 1802, and Scincus Sloanei Daudin, 1802, but he did not select a type species. Subsequently, Fitzinger selected \\"Eumeces mabouia\\" (=Mabuya mabouya) as the type species, but his designation is invalid because Wagler did not include this species in his original concept of the genus.Bauer, 2003, pp. 4‚Äì5 In 1957, Loveridge selected Scincus agilis (=Mabuya agilis) as the type species from among the species Wagler had included as the type species, and in 1970 Peters and Donoso-Barros listed, without comment, Lacerta punctata Linnaeus (=Lygosoma punctatum) as the type species. When Mausfeld and others split Mabuya in 2002, they resurrected Euprepis for the group including African and Malagasy species and the Noronha skink and also listed Lacerta punctata as the type species, considering all previous type designations invalid.Mausfeld, pers. comm., in Bauer, 2003, p. 4 In 2003, Bauer argued that the earliest type species designation is valid, so the type species of Euprepis is Scincus agilis, a member of Mabuya as restricted by Mausfeld and others in 2002 (including only American species), making Euprepis a junior synonym of Mabuya. Bauer also argued that Lacerta punctata did not apply to a species of the African Mabuya group, as Mausfeld and others had assumed, but rather to the Asian species Lygosoma punctatum. Species Among the species previously included in Euprepis or Euprepes are the following: *Euprepis atlanticus: Mausfeld et al., 2002Mausfeld et al., 2002, p. 290 ‚Äì currently Trachylepis atlantica *Euprepes chaperi Vaillant, 1884 ‚Äì currently Lygosoma sundevalliBoulenger, 1887, p. 307 *Euprepis punctatus: Gray, 1845Gray, 1845, p. 111 ‚Äì currently Trachylepis atlantica Footnotes References Literature cited *Bauer, A.M. 2003.

Unlike most small skinks, which have smooth scales, this species has rough, ridged and pointed scales. These keeled scales may be an adaptation to its high-rainfall habitat, to its microhabitat in rotting logs, or to camouflage it when moving through forest leaf-litter. Taxonomy This species, Concinnia queenslandiae, is a member of the Australian \\"Sphenomorphid\\" group of skinks (family Scincidae), which includes such genera as Ctenotus, Anomalopus and Eulamprus. Although formerly placed in the monotypic genus Gnypetoscincus, molecular phylogenetic studies by O'Connor & Moritz (2003) and Skinner et al.(2013) demonstrated that this species forms a well supported clade that included Nangura spinosa (also an unusual, narrowly endemic monotypic genus) along with the five species of the Eulamprus tenuis group. Among other taxonomic changes within the Australian Sphenomorphids, Skinner and co-authors placed this well supported clade into the genus Concinnia, with the Nangur spiny skink, C. spinosus, and the prickly skink, C. queenslandiae, as successive sister groups to the remaining species . Distribution and life History The prickly skink is a habitat specialist restricted to closed canopy forest in high rainfall areas (rainforests) of the Australian Wet Tropics, extending from lowland tropical rainforest to montane forests on the adjacent hills and tablelands. Within these rainforests the prickly skink occurs within rotting logs and leaf litter and although locally abundant in some areas, it is rarely seen without searching. This is a well buffered environment with very low seasonality. This species is ovoviviparous, and despite living in an equable climate, reproduction is seasonal, with females giving birth to 2-5 young in February - April. Animals mature at a snout-vent length (SVL) of around and grow to a maximum SVL of , with no obvious difference in external morphology or size between females and males. A skeletochronological study suggested that this corresponds with an age of 5 years at maturity and a maximum life-span around 10 years. Unlike most skinks this is a vocal species with high-pitched but audible calls recorded in the field and in captivity, associated with handling and with aggressive interactions among females. Phylogeography and Population Biology Extensive upland areas of the Australian Wet Tropics, such as the Atherton Tableland, were cleared for farming, largely between 1940 and 1990, leaving many scattered pockets of rainforest surrounded by open pasture. The prickly skink is abundant throughout this area and has become a research subject for studies on the effect of habitat fragmentation on genetic diversity, gene flow and adaptation in a rainforest dependent species. A 1993 phylogeographic study by Moritz and co-authors using allozyme electrophoresis and restriction mapping of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) genomes found distinct genetic lineages in populations from the northern and southern wet tropics. These areas are currently connected by a ribbon of rainforest habitat, around wide, known as the Black Mountain Corridor or BMC, but historical climate modeling suggest that rainforests in the northern and southern wet tropics were separated by around of dry habitats in this area during Pleistocene glacial climate periods. However, the deep divergence between these lineages suggests much longer genetic isolation, with an estimated separation time of over five million years, and these populations may represent different species. Further study of mtDNA and allozyme variation from sites around the Atherton Tablelands (within the Southern Lineage) revealed additional phylogeographic structure, with a divergence between populations around the Bellenden Ker / Wooroonooran Range, east of the Atherton Tableland, and those in the central and southern tablelands. The late-Pleistocene divergence between these lineages (>0.5% across the mtDNA genome) is an order of magnitude less than that between the Northern and Southern Wet Tropics but is indicative of emergence from separate glacial refugia. The larger Wooroonooran refugium maintained higher diversity through the glacial period than the southern Tableland refugium and this natural historical difference in genetic diversity is much greater than any more recent, human induced, effects of forest clearing and fragmentation. More detailed study of genetic variation in populations from the Atherton tableland, using mtDNA sequences and microsatellite loci, revealed a slight reduction in allelic diversity and in the pattern of isolation by distance among populations. Also, Sumner found relatedness among males within fragments was lower in isolated forest fragments than within continuous forests, possibly reflecting greater dispersal within fragments due to lower habitat quality. However, these relatively slight differences show the difficulty of detecting effects of recent habitat fragmentation in a species with relatively low local population size and limited dispersal. Sumner and co-authors did find other ecological effects of fragmentation; skink abundance was higher in continuous forest sites than in fragments, and was lower in small habitat patches than in large patches, and on average, skinks from fragments were smaller than those from continuous forests. Estimates of population density and dispersal distances from capture-recapture methods and from genetic data are broadly consistent, with a density varying from 65 - 136 individuals per ha, and a dispersal distance of 404 ‚Äì 843 m2, respectively. Genetic estimates of relatedness among individuals found under the same log revealed that juveniles tend to stay with their parents for 1‚Äì2 years and subsequently disperse to other logs, with marked individuals observed away from their initial capture site over three years.

C. gerrardii is endemic to Australia, where it is also called commonly the pink-tongued lizard. As suggested by these common names, its distinguishing characteristic is a pink tongue as opposed to the blue tongue of lizards of the closely related genus Tiliqua. Etymology The specific name, gerrardii, is in honor of British herpetologist Edward Gerrard (1810-1910), who was Gray's \\"right-hand man\\" at the British Museum.Beolens, Bo; Watkins, Michael; Grayson, Michael (2011). The Eponym Dictionary of Reptiles. Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press. xiii + 296 pp. . (Hemisphaeriodon gerrardi, p. 100). Geographic range C. gerrardii is endemic to Australia. It can be found from Springwood, New South Wales, along the eastern coastal country and eastern ranges to the Cairns Region, Queensland. Description Close-up of the head C. gerrardii is a relatively large lizard of up to total length (including tail). It has a slender body with a long, slender and slightly prehensile tail about the same length as the body. The limbs are well developed with long digits and sharp claws. The neck is well pronounced, and the head is relatively large, wider in males than in females. In adults the tongue is pink. C. gerrardii has a slate-grey to fawn dorsal ground colour with dark grey to brown or black cross bands. These bands are more pronounced in males and less so in females. There are about 20 cross bands from the neck to the tip of the tail, which run slightly backwards laterally. The ventral surfaces of C. gerrardii are white to pinkish or creamy brown and may be marbled on the cross bands. The scales are smooth and, on the head, edged with a darker colour. The tip of the snout is dark in adults with some darker spots on the head. The limbs are spotted or streaked darkly. All juveniles are marked with pronounced black cross bands on a very light grey ground colour. There are several dark spots on the head, especially under the eyes. The tip of the snout is light in colour and the tongue and mouth are blue. Similar species (Cogger 2000): C. gerrardii has been associated with the genus Tiliqua as well as the genus Cyclodomorphus due to their close relation (previous names: Cyclodomorphus gerrardii and Tiliqua gerrardii). C. gerrardii is very similar in appearance to the eastern blue-tongue, Tiliqua scincoides; however, C. gerrardii has, true to its common name, a pink tongue as an adult. It is also much more slender than T. scincoides, having a more slender body, a much longer and narrower tail as well as a smaller head. In addition, the limbs are more developed and longer than those of the blue-tongues. Ecology and behaviour C. gerrardii inhabits wet sclerophyll forests and rainforests as well as moist areas in woodlands. It shelters beneath leaf litter, in hollow logs, and in crevices of rocks and trees. Its slender body and limbs are an adaptation for moving in thick undergrowth. C. gerrardii moves with lateral undulations on smooth surfaces, but holds its hind limbs close to the body and moves its tail in a side-winding motion when moving through grass and when climbing on branches, using only the forelimbs. Its main diet consists of snails and slugs, for which it forages during twilight hours and at night in summer, and also during the day in cooler months. To crush the shells of snails, C. gerrardii uses its large and flattened teeth in the back of the upper and lower jaw. C. gerrardii is a good climber, using its semi-prehensile tail as a supporting aid and, although only partially arboreal, climbing trees to feed when necessary. The juveniles seem to climb vegetation more frequently to avoid predation. When threatened, C. gerrardii raises its body off the ground to appear larger, and flickers or vibrates its tongue rapidly similar to snakes. Breeding biology In C. gerrardii courtship occurs in early spring for a period of six weeks, during which time males have been observed to fight. In mating, the male grasps the female's head with his jaws and mounts her. After an estimated gestation period of 101 to 110 days, females produce large litters of 20 to 30 (largest recorded: 67) live-young in early summer.Wilson SK, Knowles DG (1988). Australian Reptiles: A Photographic Reference of Australia. Sydney: Collins Australia. During birth, the female holds her hind legs close to her body, as when moving through grass, giving single births about every 30 minutes during which she moves around. The young are born curled up in a foetal membrane, which they eat after breaking free. Immediately after birth, the young start flickering their tongues. The tongue and mouth are dark blue and the ventral surface is black in juveniles, changing to pink and mauve respectively after about three months. The young are independent from straight after birth without any parental care and start feeding on slugs and snails. Age at sexual maturity is about 22 months.

FL Studio (and other DAWs) is designed to allow artists to create music using virtual instruments, synthesizers, recorded samples, and effects. FL Studio features a graphical user interface with a pattern-based music sequencer. The program is available in four different editions for Microsoft Windows and macOS. Image-Line offers lifetime free updates to the program, which means customers receive all future updates of the software for free after one time purchase. Image-Line also develops FL Studio Mobile for iPod Touch, iPhone, iPad and Android devices. FL Studio can also be used as a Virtual Studio Technology (VST) instrument in other audio workstation programs and also functions as a ReWire client. Image- Line also offers its own VST instruments and audio applications. FL Studio has been used by numerous highly visible hip hop and EDM producers, including Porter Robinson, Madeon, Soulja Boy, Martin Garrix, Avicii, and Deadmau5. History The first version of FruityLoops (1.0.0) was developed by Didier Dambrin and was partially released in December 1997. Its official launch was in early 1998, when it was still a four-channel MIDI drum machine. Dambrin became Chief Software Architect for the program, and it quickly underwent a series of large upgrades that made it into a popular and complex digital audio workstation. FruityLoops was renamed FL Studio in 2003, after the threat of a lawsuit from Kellogg's and to improve the software's marketability. Software piracy was a major issue in the company's early days, and it took nearly five years for the company to earn money from users purchasing legitimate licenses. On 22 May 2018, a macOS-compatible version of FL Studio was released. Overview = Editions = FL Studio comes in several editions with different levels of functionality. The free trial version includes all of the program's features, all plugins, and allows users to render project audio to WAV, MIDI, MP3, and OGG. Projects saved while in demo mode, however, can only be opened once FL Studio and its plugins have been registered. Also, instrument presets cannot be saved and the audio output of some instruments will cut out momentarily every few minutes until the program and its plugins have been registered.  FL Studio Express  This version allows for step sequencer-only editing and is intended for 64-step loop creation. Each pattern can consist of an unlimited number of instruments‚Äîeither samples, native instruments, or VST instruments. Instruments in the pattern can be routed to the Mixer tool for effects processing, and effects as of version 10.0 include Delay, Delay Bank, EQUO, Flangus, Love Philter, Vocoder, Parametric EQ & EQ2, Multiband Compressor, Spectroman, Stereo Enhancer, Wave Candy, Wave Shaper, and Soundgoodizer. There is no piano roll, playlist ability, automation, audio recording, or VST/ReWire client.  Fruity Edition  The Fruity Edition allows users to access the playlist, piano roll, and event automation features, which allow for complex and lengthy arranging and sequencing. There is also VST/ReWire support so that FL Studio can be an instrument in other hosts such as Cubase, Sonic Solutions, Logic, and other software. As of version 10.0 this edition includes the Simsynth Live synthesizer instrument, the DrumSynth live percussion synthesizer, the DX10FM synthesizer, and the Wasp/Wasp XT synthesizers. There is no audio recording feature. In FL Studio 12, this edition was given (spline-based) automation.  Producer Edition  The Producer Edition includes all of the features of the Fruity Edition, as well as full recording for internal and external audio and post-production tools. It allows for hand-drawing point and curve based splines (referred to as \\"Automation Clips\\"). Plugins include Edison, Slicex (loop slicer and re- arranger), Sytrus, Maximus, Vocodex and Synthmaker. It also allows for waveform viewing of audio clips and the ability to add cue points.  Signature Bundle  This edition includes the Producer Edition as well as a series of plugins such as the Fruity Video player, DirectWave Sampler, Harmless, NewTone, Pitcher, Gross Beat and the Hardcore Guitar Effects Suite.  All Plugins Bundle  The All Plugins Bundle includes the Signature Bundle along with extra plugins, particularly synthesizers.  Mobile  On June 21, 2011, Image-Line released FL Studio Mobile for iOS and in April 2013 for Android. Both support the ability to create multi-track projects on mobile devices including iPod Touches, iPhones, iPads., Android 2.3.3 and higher Smart Phones and Tablets.  Groove  On September 2, 2013, a new standalone app for Windows 8 was released. It is a Groovebox-style application optimised for touch-based music creation. =System requirements= FL Studio 20 works on Windows 7/8/10 (32-bit or 64-bit versions) or on macOS 10.13. FL Studio requires a 2 GHz AMD or Intel Pentium 3 CPU with full SSE1 support. It requires 2 GB of free disk space and 4 GB of RAM is recommended. The website states that \\"the more powerful your CPU, the more instruments and FX you can run.\\" FL Studio processes audio using an internal 32-bit floating point engine. It supports sampling rates up to 192 kHz using either WDM or ASIO enabled drivers. =Program features= *Version 9 introduced support for multi-core effects processing and improved support for multi-core instrument processing. *Version 10, released on March 29, 2011, included a new project browser, fixed some bugs, and smoothed envelope points. It also introduced Patcher, a modular workflow environment capable of chaining together an unlimited number of instruments and effects. *Version 11, released on April 19, 2013, included multi-touch support, improved tempo automation, new plugins such as BassDrum, GMS, Effector, Patcher, and new piano roll features (VFX Key Mapper, VFX Color Mapper). *Version 12, released on April 22, 2015, added a new vectorial UI, updated plugins, multi-touch support, a redesigned mixer, improved 32 & 64 bit plugin support and improved file management. *Version 20, released on May 22, 2018, skipped versions 13 to 19 to celebrate the 20th anniversary of the program. It introduced native macOS support, multiple time- signatures, MIDI conversion to audio, unlimited playlist arrangements, improved Plugin Delay Compensation, the return of the Step Sequencer Graph Editor, In-situ rendering (\\"freezing\\"), and other improvements. The mixer interface allows for any number of channel configurations. This allows mixing in 2.1, 5.1, or 7.1 surround sound, as long as the output hardware interface has an equivalent number of outputs. The mixer also supports audio-in, enabling FL Studio to record multitrack audio. FL Studio supports audio time stretching and pitch scaling, beat slicing, chopping, and editing of audio, and as of version 12.9 it can record up to 125 simultaneous audio tracks. Other key features include a digital piano roll. Audio can be imported or exported as WAV, MP3, OGG, FLAC, MIDI, ZIP, or the native project format with an .FLP filename extension. The trial allows users to save projects, but does not allow re-opening them. Tracks may be exported to any of the available file formats. Plug-ins FL Studio comes with a variety of plugins and generators (software synthesizers) written in the program's own native plugin architecture. FL Studio also has support for third-party VST and DirectX plugins. The API has a built in wrapper for full VST, VST2, VST3, DX, and ReWire compatibility. Many of the plugins also function independently as standalone programs. =Virtual effects= FL Studio is bundled with a variety of sound processing effects, including common audio effects such as chorus, compression, distortion, delay, flanger, phaser, reverb, gate, equalization, vocoding, maximization, and limiting. =Synthesizers= FL Studio is bundled with 32 generator plugins (October 2011). Some are demos whilst some are full versions. Reception FL Studio has been praised for its simplicity, power, and ease of use. Jamie Lendino of PCMag wrote that \\"While [FL Studio is] still clearly geared for electronic music production 'in the box,' as opposed to recording live musicians playing acoustic instruments, you can record or create just about any kind of audio project with it.\\" Criticisms include a difficult audio recording system, poor support for bulk manipulation of instruments, and an unappealing user interface.

Diet  Garden skinks feed on larger invertebrates, including crickets, moths, slaters, earthworms, flies, grubs and caterpillars, grasshoppers, cockroaches, earwigs, slugs, dandelions, small spiders, chaparras, ladybeetles and many other small insects, which makes them a very helpful animal around the garden. They can also feed on fruit and vegetables, but the vegetables have to be cooked for the skink to be able to eat it. Skinks especially love bananas and strawberries etc. (no citrus fruit). Garden skinks rely purely on the movement of their prey when hunting. When hunting, the skinks will either hide and wait for prey to come by or actively pursue it (this depends on how hungry they are). Once they have caught their prey, they shake it around vigorously to kill it before swallowing it whole. Once they have had one meal, they begin to actively pursue prey for a short while with their newfound energy. Skinks only need one prey item per 4 or 5 days, thus, making it an ideal pet for small children. They can eat worms if you drain the soil out of them with salt water because worms are too high in soil for them.Help skinks thrive in your garden.

The genus is especially notable for the variation in the amount of limb reduction. The variation ranges from short-bodied forms with large legs bearing five toes, to elongate forms completely lacking legs. The body length of the lizards is . Their locomotion is linked to their body shape. The shorter skinks with prominent limbs travel on the surface; the longer skinks with reduced legs tend to burrow more. A phylogenetic tree of Lerista, derived from DNA analysis, reveals that limb loss has happened multiple times within this group.

None have been observed since the early 20th century. Taxonomy The specific name, coctei, is in honor of French physician and zoologist Jean Th√©odore Cocteau (1798-1838).Beolens, Bo; Watkins, Michael; Grayson, Michael (2011). The Eponym Dictionary of Reptiles. Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press. xiii + 296 pp. . (Macroscincus coctei, p.56). It has been found through mitochrondrial DNA sequences that C. coctei was most closely related to the skink genus Mabuya. Description Two preserved specimens It was very large for a skink. Adults could attain a snout to vent length (SVL) of , and the cylindrical tail was as long as the head and body.Boulenger GA (1887). Catalogue of the Lizards in the British Museum (Natural History). Second Edition. Volume III. ... Scincid√¶ ... London: Trustees of the British Museum (Natural History). (Taylor and Francis, printers). xii + 575 pp. + Plates I-XL. (Macroscincus coctei, p. 149). Behaviour and ecology It was largely herbivorous, but whether out of necessity with deteriorating conditions or from opportunistic advantage, occasionally became more carnivorous as individuals would occasionally eat the young from nesting shore birds. German herpetologists had noted Macroscincus consuming birds in captivity in the early 20th century. One interesting aspect of this species is that it possessed a transparent lower eyelid; possibly to spot predators from below. From the examination of preserved specimens, it appears that this species had a \\"belly button\\" slit, indicating viviparity. However, there are also reports that indicate this species was an egg layer. It is considered unique among the Scincidae in having tooth crowns which are labiolingually compressed and multicuspate. It had a SENI value of 0.13. As such, it was a partially arboreal skink that was borderline enough to adapt to the semi-desert like conditions created when the Cape Verde islands were denuded by humans and domesticated animals centuries ago. Extinction Causes cited for their decline include over hunting for food and use for \\"skink oil\\" by natives of neighboring islands and prolonged drought. At one time, starving convicts were marooned in the Cape Verde archipelago and ate the extant population. An explorer, Leonardo Fea, brought back several specimens which are now housed in Italy. This constitutes the extant specimens. Subsequent explorers such as Sheliech, Andreone, and Pather, have failed to find living individuals and has not been found since 1940. In the early 20th century, German herpetologists tried to captive-breed this species to no avail. In the 2013.1 version of the IUCN Red List, the IUCN declared it officially extinct.

He was a friend and student of Erasmus. He was appointed secretary to the Portuguese factory in Antwerp in 1523 by King John III of Portugal. He compiled one of the first accounts on Ethiopian Christianity. Biography G√≥is (originally spelled as Goes) was born in Alenquer, Portugal, into a noble family who served the Portuguese kings. His father, Rui Dias de G√≥is was a valet to Duke of Aveiro, and his mother was Isabel Gomes de Limi, a descendant of Flemish merchants who established themselves in Portugal. Dami√£o's paternal grandfather, Gomes Dias de G√≥is, had been in the entourage of Prince Henry the Navigator. Hirsch, E.F., Dami√£o de Gois: The Life and Thought of a Portuguese Humanist, 1502‚Äì1574, Springer Science & Business Media, 2012, pp 1-6 Around 1518, G√≥is joined the court of King Manuel I of Portugal. Under Manuel I‚Äôs successor, King John III of Portugal, in 1523, he was sent to Antwerp, as secretary and treasurer of the Portuguese feitoria (factory, trading post and commercial office). Henceforth, G√≥is travelled intensely (Poland, Lithuania, Denmark, Germany, Sweden, France, England, Italy), entering into contact with a number of important figures, like Sebastian M√ºnster, Erasmus (who hosted him in Freiburg), Ramusio, Philipp Melanchthon, Thomas More and Martin Luther. Among the many Portuguese acquaintances, G√≥is was friend of the writers Jo√£o de Barros and Andr√© de Resende. A humanist and an open mind, G√≥is followed courses at the Universities of Padua and Leuven, wrote on various topics, like the condition of the Sami people (\\"Lapps\\"), and translated some classic works ‚Äì among them, Cicero‚Äôs Cato maior de senectute ‚Äì into Portuguese. He was also a composer of some musical pieces and kept a private collection of paintings. G√≥is translated into Latin a Portuguese opuscle on the Ethiopian embassy of the Armenian Mateus (the representative of the Negus Dawit II) to Portugal (1532), which also included the famous \\"Letter of Prester John\\" written by the Ethiopian Queen Eleni (1509) and a \\"Confessio illorum fidei\\". In 1538 he published a translation of the Biblical book Ecclesiastes in Portuguese, though it was not widely circulated. In the same year, he took a Dutch wife, Joana van Hargen (known as Joana de Argem in Portugal), daughter of a Flemish councilman to the Court of Carlos V. In 1540, he published the famous Fides, religio, moresque Aethiopum (\\"Ethiopian faith, religion, and mores\\"). The book received a widespread diffusion in Europe, in both Catholic and Protestant circles, and enjoyed of successive editions (Paris 1541, Leuven 1544, Leiden 1561, Cologne 1574). It also earned the author, however, the criticisms of the powerful Portuguese Cardinal Henry of Portugal, who, as Grand Inquisitor of the Portuguese Inquisition, banned its circulation in the kingdom. The Jesuit order proved equally critical, as he was accused by the Provincial superior Sim√£o Rodrigues of Lutheranism, and of being a disciple of Erasmus, before the Inquisition.\\"Dami√£o de G√≥is,\\" Encyclopedia Britannica, Online: https://www.britannica.com/biography/Damiao-de-Gois He was settled at Louvain, then the literary centre of the Low Countries, when the French besieged the town in 1542. He was given the command of the defending forces, and saved Louvain, but was taken prisoner and confined for nine months in France, till he obtained his freedom by a heavy ransom. He was rewarded, however, by a grant of arms from Charles V. He finally returned to Portugal in 1545, with a view of becoming tutor to the king's son, but he failed to obtain this post, owing to the accusations before the Inquisition. In 1548, G√≥is was named Guarda-Mor (High Guardian) of the Torre do Tombo (Royal Archives) and ten years later was entrusted by the same Cardinal Henry to write the chronicle of Manuel I‚Äôs reign. The task has been previously confided to de Barros, but relinquished by him. The work was completed in some seven years and became his major achievement; nonetheless it was widely attacked and parts of it were significantly censored. He also published a description of the city of Lisbon ‚Äì Urbis Olisiponis Descriptio (1554). In 1570 the inquisitorial process opened again, sending G√≥is to reclusion in the monastery of Batalha. He died shortly after in Alenquer under mysterious circumstances (apparently, murder), free but sick, and was buried in the church of Nossa Senhora da V√°rzea. G√≥is had several children: Manuel in 1540, Ambr√≥sio in 1541, Rui Dias de G√≥is, Ant√≥nio de G√≥is, Catarina de G√≥is, and Maria de G√≥is.

Most national countries have overtime labour laws designed to dissuade or prevent employers from forcing their employees to work excessively long hours (such as the situation in the textile mills in the 1920s). These laws may take into account other considerations than humanitarian concerns, such as preserving the health of workers so that they may continue to be productive, or increasing the overall level of employment in the economy. One common approach to regulating overtime is to require employers to pay workers at a higher hourly rate for overtime work. Companies may choose to pay workers higher overtime pay even if not obliged to do so by law, particularly if they believe that they face a backward bending supply curve of labour. Overtime pay rates can cause workers to work longer hours than they would at a flat hourly rate. Overtime laws, attitudes toward overtime and hours of work vary greatly from country to country and between various sectors. Time off in lieu Time off in lieu; compensatory time; or comp time refers to a type of work schedule arrangement that allows (or requires) workers to take time off instead of, or in addition to, receiving overtime pay. A worker may receive overtime pay plus equal time off for each hour worked on certain agreed days, such as public holidays. In the United States, such arrangements are currently legal in the public sector but not in the private sector.See 29 U.S.C. 207(o) For example, non-exempt workers must receive at least one and one half times their normal hourly wage for every hour worked beyond 40 hours in a work week. For example, workers who clock 48 hours in one week would receive the pay equivalent to 52 hours of work (40 hours + 8 hours at 1.5 times the normal hourly wage). With comp time, the worker could (or would have to) forgo the 12 hours of overtime pay and instead take 8 paid hours off at some future date. In some other jurisdictions, such as Canada, employers might be required to pay the overtime at the higher rate (e.g. 1.5 times the normal rate), but also be allowed to require time off in lieu at the normal rate. Thus, an employee might work 48 hours in one week, and 32 hours the next week (assuming over 40 hours is overtime), and be paid an extra amount equivalent to 4 hours work (8 multiplied by 0.5). In Australia, such arrangements both in the private and public sector are common. In some cases, particularly when employees are represented by a labour union, overtime may be paid at a higher rate than 1.5 times the hourly pay. In some factories, for example, if workers are required to work on a Sunday, they may be paid twice their regular rate (i.e., \\"double time\\"). Overtime laws by jurisdiction =European Union= Directives issued by the European Union must be incorporated into law by member states. Directives 93/104/EC (1993), 2000/34/EC (2000), which limited working hours, were consolidated into 2003/88/EC (2003). Employers and employees can agree to opt out, under certain circumstances. The directives require:http://eur- lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/ALL/?uri=CELEX:32003L0088 * maximum average working week (including overtime) of 48 hours over a 17-week reference period * minimum daily rest period of 11 consecutive hours in every 24 * breaks when the working day exceeds 6 hours * minimum weekly rest period of 24 hours plus the 11 hours daily rest period in every 7-day period * minimum of 4 weeks paid annual leave * night work restricted to an average of 8 hours in any 24-hour period The directives apply to: *all sectors of activity, both public and private *Doctors in training used to work a maximum week of 58 hours until 2009. From 1 August 2009 their maximum working week fell to 48 hours. Exemptions: * Member States of the EC may exempt: managing executives or other persons with autonomous decision-making power; family workers; and workers officiating at religious ceremonies. These are workers whose working time is not measured or pre-determined or can be determined by the workers. * Other categories can be exempted from the directive's key provisions provided compensatory rest or appropriate protection is granted. These include employees who work a long way from home, or whose activities require a permanent presence or continuity of service or production, or who work in sectors which have peaks of activity. Examples include off-shore workers, security guards, journalists, emergency workers, agricultural workers, tour guides, etc. =Japan= In Japan the of 1947 provides for an eight-hour work day and 40-hour workweek with at least one day off per week. The act requires a premium of at least 25% over the ordinary hourly wage for any overtime work, 35% for any work on prescribed off days, and an additional 25% for any work between 10 pm and 5 am. Employers must enter into an overtime agreement with a labour representative prior to any overtime work by employees, and this agreement must stipulate to the maximum number of overtime hours that an employee may work, which may be no more than 15 hours per week, 45 hours per month and 360 hours per year. =United States= Federal overtime law In the United States the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 applies to employees in industries engaged in or producing goods for interstate commerce. The FLSA establishes a standard work week of 40 hours for certain kinds of workers, and mandates payment for overtime hours to those workers of one and one-half times the workers' normal rate of pay for any time worked above 40 hours. The law creates two broad categories of employees, * those who are \\"exempt\\" from the regulation and * those who are \\"non-exempt\\". Employers are not required to pay exempt employees overtime but must do so for non-exempt employees. Exempt Independent contractors are not considered employees and therefore are not protected by the FLSA. Several factors determine whether a worker is an employee, who might be entitled to overtime compensation, or an independent contractor, who would not be so entitled. The employment agreement stating that a party is an independent contractor does not make it necessarily so. The nature of a job determines whether an employee is entitled to overtime pay, not employment status or the field of work. Classes of workers who are exempt from the regulation include certain types of administrative, professional, and executive employees. To qualify as an administrative, professional, or executive employee and therefore not be entitled to overtime, three tests must be passed based on salary basis, duties, and salary level. There are many other classes of workers who may be exempt including outside salespeople, certain agricultural employees, certain live-in employees, and certain transportation employees. Employees can neither waive their FLSA protections nor abridge them by contract. Protections An employer may not retaliate against an employee for filing a complaint or instituting a proceeding based on the FLSA. An employer that engages in any form of verifiable retaliation would be liable under the Fair Labor Standards Act Section 216(b) for equitable relief including reinstatement, promotion, payment of lost wages, and payment of liquidated damages. Acts of retaliation include terminating employment, disrupting the workplace, threats, acts of physical violence, and constructive discharge. Statistics Out of approximately 120 million American workers, nearly 50 million are exempt from overtime laws (US Department of Labor, Wage and Hour Division, 1998). In 2004, the United States was 7th out of 24 OECD countries in terms of annual working hours per worker. (See Working time for a complete listing.) In 2015, the United States Department of Labor proposed dramatic changes to certain exemptions from federal minimum wage and overtime requirements. These changes are anticipated to take effect in July 2016, but as of January 2016, still are pending final approval. Proposed changes include: setting the minimum salary level required for exemption for full-time salaried workers at $970 per week, or $50,440 annually (an increase from the current $455 per week, or $23,660 annually) Increasing the total annual compensation required to exempt highly compensated employees to $122,148 annually (from the current $100,000 annually). On August 23, 2004, President George W. Bush and the Department of Labor proposed changes to regulations governing implementation of the law. According to one study, the changes would have had significant impact on the number of workers covered by overtime laws and have exempted several million additional workers.(Economic Policy Institute) The Bush administration maintained that the practical impact on working Americans would be minimal and that the changes would help clarify an outdated regulation. In particular, the new rules would have allowed more companies to offer flextime to their workers instead of overtime. The definition of exempt employees (ineligible for overtime) is regularly tested in the courts. A recent case is Encino Motorcars v. Navarro, which addresses the question of whether automobile dealer service advisors are eligible for overtime. A company may harm themselves by docking a salaried employee for disciplinary reasons. ::\\"Once pay is reduced using an hourly calculation, ... the employee is considered nonexempt, and so is every other worker in that job group.\\" Uber is an example of a company that, in various jurisdictions, has been subject to litigation regarding exemptions. The New York Times noted in 2017 that \\"Despite their appeal, the apps have faced a wave of criticism, including concerns over wheelchair accessibility and driver pay.\\" California overtime law The state of California's overtime laws differ from federal overtime laws in many respects, and they involve overlapping statutes, regulations, and precedents that govern the compensation of employees in California. * Governing federal law is the Fair Labor Standards Act (29 USC 201‚Äì219) * California overtime law is codified in provisions of: :*the California Labor Code and in :*Wage orders of the Industrial Welfare Commission California employers must comply with both, since there are two sources of applicable law (federal and state). In California, based on California Labor Code 1171, only an employment relationship is required for overtime rules to apply. Under the California Industrial Welfare Commission Wage Orders, an \\"employer\\" is \\"any person ... who directly or indirectly, or through an agent or any other person, employs or exercises control over wages, hours, or working conditions of any person.\\" Under the California Labor Code, an \\"employee\\" is \\"[any] person, including aliens and minors, rendering actual service in any business for an employer, whether gratuitously or for wages or pay, whether the wages or pay are measured by the standard of time, piece, task, commission, or other method of calculation, and whether the service is rendered on a commission, concessionaire, or other basis.\\" California: who is covered Independent contractors are not employees covered by overtime laws and so it is important to determine if a worker is an independent contractor or an employee. Foremost, pursuant to California Labor Code Section 510, non-exempt employees must be compensated at one and a half times the regular rate of pay for all hours worked in excess of eight hours in a workday, 40 hours in a workweek and the first eight hours of a seventh consecutive workday. Employees in California are entitled to double-time for working more than twelve hour workdays or more than eight hours on the seventh consecutive workday of a single workweek. Under federal law there are only 40 hour weekly overtime limits. The eight-hour overtime limit in California frequently gives rise to wage-and-hour litigation for violations of state (but not federal) labour laws. For example, \\"comp time\\" schemes in which employers tell employees that since they worked 10 hours on Monday they can work 6 hours on Tuesday are illegal because even though employees are not working more than 40 hours for the purposes of overtime compensation under federal law, they are working more than 8 hours for purposes of California overtime law, and rounding the 6- and 10-hour workdays to two 8-hour workdays would cheat the employee out of two hours of overtime pay. Perhaps the biggest difference between California and federal overtime law relates to the administrative exemption's \\"primarily engaged\\" in duties that meet the test for the exemption requirement, such as duties that involve exercising independent discretion and judgment as set forth in the controversial Order No. 4. Under the Fair Labor Standards Act \\"primarily engaged\\" does not necessarily mean at least half, but California wage-and-hour laws, working less than half of exempt duties automatically eliminates the overtime exemption.

(Due to different methods of romanising Arabic names, the spellings As-Saffah and Al-Saffah may both be found.) Ab≈´'l ‚ÄòAbbƒÅs' laqab or caliphal title was As-SaffƒÅ·∏• (), meaning \\"the Blood-Shedder\\" for his ruthless tactics and perhaps also to instill fear in his enemies. Family origins and earlier history As-SaffƒÅ·∏•, born in Humeima (modern-day Jordan), was head of one branch of the Banu HƒÅshim from Arabia, a subclan of the Quraysh tribe who traced its lineage to HƒÅshim, a great-grandfather of Muhammad via 'AbbƒÅs, an uncle of Muhammad, hence the title \\"Abbasid\\" for his descendants' caliphate. This indirect link to Muhammad's larger clan formed sufficient basis for As- Saffah's claim to the title caliph. As narrated in many hadith, many believed that in the end times a great leader or mahdi would appear from the family of Muhammad, to which Ali belonged, who would deliver Islam from corrupt leadership. The half-hearted policies of the late Umayyads to tolerate non- Arab Muslims and Shi'as had failed to quell unrest among these minorities. During the reign of late Umayyad Caliph Hisham ibn Abd al-Malik this unrest led to a revolt in Kufa in southern Iraq, mainly by the town's slaves. Shi'ites revolted in 736 and held the city until 740, led by Zayd ibn Ali, a grandson of Husayn and another member of the Banu Hashim. Zayd's rebellion was put down by Umayyad armies in 740. The revolt in Kufa indicated both the strength of the Umayyads and the growing unrest in the Muslim world. During the last days of the Umayyad caliphate, Abu al-‚ÄòAbbƒÅs and his clan chose to begin their rebellion in KhurasƒÅn, an important, but remote military region comprising eastern Iran, southern parts of the modern Central Asian republics of Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, Kyrgyzstan and northern Afghanistan. In 743, the death of the Umayyad Caliph HishƒÅm provoked a rebellion in the east. Abu al-\`AbbƒÅs, supported by Shi'as and the residents of KhurasƒÅn, led his forces to victory over the Umayyads. The civil war was marked by millennial prophecies encouraged by the beliefs of some Shi'as that As-SaffƒÅ·∏• was the mahdi. In Shi'ite works such as the Al-Jafr faithful Muslims were told that the brutal civil war was the great conflict between good and evil. The choice of the Umayyads to enter battle with white flags and the Abbasids to enter with black encouraged such theories. The color white, however, was regarded in much of Persia as a sign of mourning. As-Saffah's Caliphate In early October 749 (132 AH), Abu al-'AbbƒÅs as-SaffƒÅh's rebel army entered Kufa, a major Muslim center in Southern Iraq. As-Saffah had not been yet declared caliph. One of his priorities was to eliminate his Umayyad rival, caliph Marwan II. The latter was defeated in February 750 at a battle on the (Great) Zab river north of Baghdad, effectively ending the Umayyad caliphate, which had ruled since 661 AD. Marwan II fled back to Damascus, which didn't welcome him, and was ultimately killed on the run in Egypt that August.Kennedy, H. (2004). The prophet and the age of the caliphates. 2nd ed. In one far- reaching, historic decision, as-SaffƒÅh established Kufa as the new capital of the caliphate, ending the dominance of Damascus in the Islamic political world, and Iraq would now become the seat of 'Abbassid power for many centuries. Dirham of Abbasid Caliph Al-Saffah Later tales recount that, concerned that there would be a return of rival Umayyad power, as-SaffƒÅh invited all of the remaining members of the Umayyad family to a dinner party where he had them clubbed to death before the first course, which was then served to the hosts.Roberts, J: History of the World. Penguin, 1994. The only survivor, Abd al-Rahman ibn Mu'awiya, escaped to the province of al-Andalus (Spain), where the Umayyad caliphate would endure for three centuries in the west in the Emirate of C√≥rdoba. Another version is that as-SaffƒÅ·∏•'s new governor to Syria, 'Abd AllƒÅh ibn 'Ali, hunted down the last of the family dynasty, with only Abd al-RahmƒÅn escaping. Ultimately, 'Abbasid rule was accepted even in Syria, and the beginning of the new Islamic dynasty was considered \\"free from major internal dissensions.\\"Kennedy, H. (2004). The prophet and the age of the caliphates. 2nd ed. Page 129. As-SaffƒÅh's four-year reign was marked with efforts to consolidate and rebuild the caliphate. His supporters were represented in the new government, but apart from his policy toward the Umayyad family, as-SaffƒÅh is widely viewed by historians as having been a mild victor. Jews, Nestorian Christians, and Persians were well represented in his government and in succeeding Abbasid administrations. Education was also encouraged, and the first paper mills, staffed by skilled Chinese prisoners captured at the Battle of Talas, were set up in Samarkand. Equally revolutionary was as-SaffƒÅh's reform of the army, which came to include non-Muslims and non-Arabs in sharp contrast to the Umayyads who refused any soldiers of either type. As-SaffƒÅh selected the gifted Abu Muslim as his military commander, an officer who would serve until 755 in the Abbasid army. Not all Muslims accept the legitimacy of his caliphate, however. According to later Shi'ites, as-SaffƒÅh turned back on his promises to the partisans of the Alids in claiming the title caliph for himself. The Shi'a had hoped that their imam would be named head of the caliphate, inaugurating the era of peace and prosperity the millennialists had believed would come. The betrayal alienated as-SaffƒÅh's Shi'a supporters, although the continued amity of other groups made Abbasid rule markedly more solvent than that of the Umayyads. Caliph Abu al-\`AbbƒÅs \`Abdu‚ÄôllƒÅh as-SaffƒÅ·∏• died of smallpox on June 10, 754 (136 AH), only four years after taking the title of caliph. Before he died, as-Saffah appointed his brother Abu Ja'far al-MansurHistory of Banu Abbas's Caliphates and, following him, the caliph's nephew Isa ibn Musa as his successors; ibn Musa, however, never filled the position. Abbasid Military Activities During his reign a great battle took place in 751 known as the Battle of Talas or Battle of Artlakh was a military engagement between the Abbasid Caliphate along with their ally the Tibetan Empire against the Chinese Tang dynasty. In July 751 AD, Tang and Abbasid forces met in the valley of the Talas River to vie for control over the Syr Darya region of central Asia. After several days of stalemate, the Karluk Turks originally allied to the Tang defected to the Abbasids and tipped the balance of power, resulting in a Tang rout. The defeat marked the end of Tang westward expansion and resulted in Muslim control of Transoxiana for the next 400 years. Control of this region was economically beneficial for the Abbasids because it was on the Silk Road. Historians debate whether or not Chinese prisoners captured in the aftermath of the battle brought paper-making technology to the Middle East, where it eventually spread to Europe. The numbers of combatants involved in the Battle of Talas are not known with certainty; however, various estimates exist. The Abbasid army (200,000 Muslim troops according to Chinese estimates, though these numbers may be greatly exaggerated) which included contingents from their Tibetan ally met the combined army of 10,000 Tang Chinese and 20,000 Karluk mercenaries (Arab records put the Chinese forces at 100,000 which also may be greatly exaggerated).The strength of Arabs is not recorded for this battle, but the armies to the east of Khorasan controlled by the Arabs later were estimated by the Chinese in 718 with 900,000 troops available to respond according to Bai Shouyi, Bai however never estimate any Abbasid army figures. (Bai 2003, pp. 225‚Äì26). In the month of July 751, the Abbasid forces joined in combat with the Tang Chinese force (the combined army of Tang Chinese and Karluk mercenaries) on the banks of the Talas river. Modern view of Talas River, which starts in the mountains of Kyrgyzstan and winds down into Kazakhstan. On the right side of the river is the city of Taraz. The Tang army was subjected to a devastating defeat. The Tang dynasty's defeat was due to the defection of Karluk mercenaries and the retreat of Ferghana allies who originally supported the Chinese. The Karluk mercenaries, two-thirds of the Tang army, defected to the Abbasids during the battle; Karluk troops attacked the Tang army from close quarters while the main Abbasid forces attacked from the front. The Tang troops were unable to hold their positions, and the commander of the Tang forces, Gao Xianzhi, recognized that defeat was imminent and managed to escape with some of his Tang regulars with the help of Li Siye. Out of an estimated 10,000 Tang troops, only 2,000 managed to return from Talas to their territory in Central Asia. Despite losing the battle, Li did inflict heavy losses on the pursuing Arab army after being reproached by Duan Xiushi. After the battle, Gao was prepared to organize another Tang army against the Arabs when the devastating An Shi Rebellion broke out in 755. When the Tang capital was taken by rebels, all Chinese armies stationed in Central Asia were ordered back to China proper to crush the rebellion.Bai, pp. 226‚Äì28. Also in 751, the Byzantine Emperor Constantine V led an invasion across the frontier of the Caliphate. The Byzantines captured Theodosiopolis (Erzurum) and Melitene (Malatya), which was demolished. There was no serious attempt to retain control of the captured cities, except for Camachum (modern Kemah, Erzincan), which was garrisoned.Treadgold (1997), pp. 360, 362Bonner, p. 107 See also * Al-Mahdi nephew and son-in-law of As-Saffah. * Ubaydallah ibn al-Mahdi an Abbasid Prince and Grandson of As-Saffah. * Sulayman ibn Ali al- Hashimi an Abbasid governor of Basra from 750 to 755. * Battle of the Zab a battle that took place on January 25, 750.

Life  The daughter of two Holocaust survivors, Hass is the only child of a Sarajevo-born Sephardic Jewish mother, who survived nine months in the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp, and a Romanian-born Ashkenazi Jewish father.Chris Kutschera. From inside an Israeli prison The Middle East. 15 January 2008 Hass was born in Jerusalem and educated at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, where she studied the history of Nazism and the European Left's relation to the Holocaust. Early in her career, she traveled widely and worked in several different jobs. Frustrated by the events of the First Intifada and by what she considered their inadequate coverage in the Israeli media, she started to report from the Palestinian territories in 1991. As of 2003 she is the only Jewish Israeli journalist who has lived full-time among the Palestinians, in Gaza from 1993 to 1997 and in Ramallah since. In 2006 she compared Israeli policies toward the Palestinian population to those of South Africa during Apartheid, saying, \\"The Palestinians, as a people, are divided into subgroups, something which is reminiscent also of South Africa under apartheid rule.\\" In September 2014 Hass went to attend a conference in Birzeit University organised by the leftist German Rosa Luxemburg Foundation and the Center for Development Studies at the university. She was asked to leave by two Birzeit lecturers because of a rule against the presence of Israelis (which she judged to mean Israeli Jews). She said that she had attended the university many times and had never heard of such a rule. The international conference's organizers were offended. The regional head of the Rosa Luxembourg Foundation, Katja Hermann, said after the incident that she would not have agreed to hold the conference at Birzeit had she been aware of the policy. The university later issued a statement saying, \\"The administration has nothing against the presence of the journalist Hass.\\"  Political position  Hass identifies as a leftist. In 2011 she joined the Freedom Flotilla II to Gaza.Israel warns foreign journalists: Joining Gaza flotilla is illegal In a speech in Vancouver, when asked whether there is any hope for the region, Hass answered, \\"Only if we continue to build a bi-national movement against Israeli apartheid.\\" In April 2013 Hass wrote an article in Haaretz defending Palestinian stone-throwing, calling it \\"the birthright and duty of anyone subject to foreign rule\\". She was criticized by left-wing politician Yossi Beilin and Adva Biton, whose three-year-old daughter was critically injured during a Palestinian rock attack. The Yesha Council filed a complaint with Attorney General Yehuda Weinstein and the police, accusing Hass of incitement to violence because stone throwing has caused serious injuries and death among Israelis.  Legal issues  = Defamation case = In June 2001, Judge Rachel Shalev-Gartel of the Jerusalem Magistrate's Court ruled that Hass had defamed the Jewish settler community of Beit Hadassah in Hebron and ordered her to pay 250,000 shekels (about $60,000) in damages. Hass had published accounts by Palestinians that claimed Israeli settlers defiled the body of a Palestinian militant killed by Israeli police; the settlers said that the event did not take place and that Hass had falsely reported the story with malicious intent. The presiding judge found in favour of the settlers, saying that television accounts contradicted Hass's account and ruling that Hass's report damaged that community's reputation. Haaretz indicated that it did not have time to arrange a defense in the case and indicated that it would appeal the decision. Hass said that she had brought forward sourced information from the Palestinian community and said that it was the responsibility of newspaper editors to cross-reference it with other information from the IDF and the settler community. = Other = On 1 December 2008, Hass, who had traveled to Gaza aboard a protest vessel, had to flee the strip due to threats to her life after she criticized Hamas. She was arrested by Israeli police on her return to Israel for being in Gaza without a permit.

It was his debut novel and won the Booker Prize in 2003. It has twice been adapted as a stage play. Plot synopsis The life of Vernon Little, a normal teenager who lives in Martirio, Texas, falls apart when his best friend, Jesus Navarro, murders their classmates in the schoolyard before killing himself, and Vernon is taken in for questioning. He cooperates with Deputy Vaine Gurie, because he had been running an errand for a teacher, Mr Nuckles, and is not involved in the massacre. The perception of Vernon's innocence weakens when his Mom's best friend, the food-obsessed Palmyra (Pam) arrives and, against Vernon's better judgment, whisks him off to Bar-B-Chew Barn, allowing the police to claim he is a flight risk. Eulalio (\\"Lally\\") Ledesma, supposedly a CNN reporter, ingratiates himself to Vernon's mother, Doris, and promises to help Vernon \\"shift the paradigm\\" of his story. Instead, Lally betrays Vernon, who is returned to jail pending a psychiatric analysis. When the court-appointed shrink, Dr Goosens, touches him inappropriately, Vernon leaves, knowing it can wreck hopes for bail. Vernon's bail hearing suggests a possible alibi and no grounds for holding him, so Vernon is released as Goosens' outpatient, subject to regular sessions. Vernon, however, is intent on living out the movie Against All Odds, repelled by Lally not only betraying him again with a video interview with Nuckles, but also by insinuating himself into Vernon's family life - including sharing Mom's bedroom. Learning a posse intends to search Keeter's field, where his rifle is hidden, Vernon races to beat them, but meets a stranger who reveals Lally is a fraud. Vernon confirms it by phoning Lally's blind, neglected mother, and plans how to get her to talk with Mom. Vernon cannot control his temper well enough to make the evidence stick, however, but Lally worries enough to bail out and move in with her friend Leona. To pacify Mom, Vernon lies about finding a job, but when he skips a session with Goosens and word comes that his rifle has been found, he extorts money from an old pervert by photographing him with Ella Bouchard, a local girl and catches a bus to San Antonio. There he phones Taylor, his crush, and meets her in Houston where she attends college. However, their meeting ends when Taylor turns out to be Leona's cousin. Fast talk and money get Vernon into Mexico without identification, and a truck driver, Pelayo, takes him to his dream world on the beach near Acapulco. Vernon awakens on his 16th birthday on top of the world, but plunges when Taylor's wired $600 does not arrive. Instead, against all odds, Taylor comes in person, takes him to a fancy hotel, and uses her wiles to get him to admit he is a murderer. Not suspecting a string of murders across Central Texas are attributed to him or that Lally has recruited Taylor, Vernon gives an out-of-context confession. Lally's people seize Vernon, turn him over to Federal marshals, and he lands in the Harris County lock-up for the summer. In the fall, Vernon's trial is televised, with court officials, witnesses, and Vernon being made up for the cameras. Vernon trusts the system implicitly. His lawyer exposes Goosens' criminal behavior, discrediting his testimony for the State, and Taylor and Lally are seen entrapping Vernon. Vernon's attempt to tell the whole truth fails, however, when the State produces Pelayo's affidavit, which provides no alibi, because Vernon uses an alias in Mexico. Nuckles alone can clear Vernon when he testifies, but explosively calls him a murderer. Vernon is cleared of the Central Texas rampage but convicted of the schoolyard slayings and is sent to Death Row. Lally has expanded his multimedia empire to include the ultimate reality show ‚Äì an execution lottery. An axe murderer turned popular preacher helps Vernon figure out his feelings towards Mom, advises him to watch animal and human behavior and to realize Vernon is God. Vernon struggles to do this as he survives several votes, but eventually his turn comes. He thinks about what presents he can give the various people in his life. He makes kind phone calls to people able to pull together an operation that destroys Lally and proves Vernon's innocence. A pardon comes seconds before the deadly chemicals are to flow into his arm. The den also yields up Jesus' suicide note, condemning Goosens and Nuckles to prison for pedophilia. Vernon and Ella prepare for a vacation in Mexico, and everything in Martirio returns to normal. Themes and style The Booker Prize judges described this book as a \\"coruscating black comedy reflecting our alarm but also our fascination with America\\". The character of Vernon as a troubled teenager has drawn comparisons with the character Holden Caulfield in J. D. Salinger's The Catcher in the Rye novel. There are also significant similarities with Mark Twain's The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn. The book is written in contemporary vernacular, with the use of satirical invective and witty irony. The town in which Vernon lives, Martirio, is given the Spanish word for martyrdom. Publication and distribution Formerly an artist, cartoonist, photographer and filmmaker, and later accused of being a conman and thief following the wild, drug-fuelled international rampage of his twenties, Pierre wrote the novel in London after a period of therapy, personal reconstruction and unemployment. He states the novel was a reaction to the culture around him, which after his own reorientation in life seemed to be full of the same delusional behaviours and self-entitlements which brought his own earlier downfall. The book was originally drafted as the first part of a trilogy which his UK publisher advised against, but which Pierre has loosely pursued in two subsequent works set 'in the presence of death', and dealing with contemporary, media-infected themes: Ludmila's Broken English (2006), and the final part of the End Times Trilogy, Lights Out in Wonderland (2010). This third book follows to their conclusion many of the questions underlying Vernon God Little, and returns to the first-person narrative of a young man set apart from his culture, this time in Europe. Awards and nominations Published in 2003, the novel was awarded the Bollinger Wodehouse Everyman Prize for Comic Fiction and the Man Booker Prize for Fiction which included the ¬£50,000 prize. Upon winning the prize, Pierre said that the money was \\"a third of what I owe in the world\\" and promptly used it to repay old debts. He also won the first novel award in the 2003 Whitbread Awards. Reception Jonathan Lethem, author of Motherless Brooklyn, wrote: \\"Read Vernon God Little not only for its dangerous relevance, but for the coruscating wit and raw vitality of its voice.\\" The Times wrote: \\"A satire brimming with opprobium for.. [the] demi- culture of reality television, fast food and speedily delivered death... a bulging burrito of a book.\\" John Carey, Merton professor of English Literature at Oxford University, and chairman of Booker judges in 2003 said: \\"Reading [Pierre's] book made me think of how the English language was in Shakespeare's day, enormously free and inventive and very idiomatic and full of poetry as well.\\" Theodore Dalrymple wrote that the novel \\"was a work of unutterably tedious nastiness and vulgarity\\" that \\"manifested itself even in its first sentence, and grew worse as the first paragraph progressed\\"; Dalrymple described the author as \\"a man with no discernible literary talent whose vulgarity of mind was deep and thoroughgoing\\". In the New York Times, Michiko Kakutani concluded that \\"In trying to score a lot of obvious points off a lot of obvious targets, Mr. Pierre may have won the Booker Prize and ratified some ugly stereotypes of Americans, but he hasn't written a terribly convincing or compelling novel.\\" Film, TV or theatrical adaptations In 2004, The Citizens Theatre, Glasgow, performed the international premiere stage adaptation by Andrea Hart, directed by Kenny Miller with Pete Ashmore in the title role as Vernon. Rufus Norris directed a critically acclaimed stage adaptation, by Tanya Ronder, at the Young Vic theatre in 2007 starring Colin Morgan as Vernon and Penny Layden as Vaine. Ronder's adaptation and the Young Vic production was nominated for the Laurence Olivier Award for Best New Play. The play was published in 2007, and a revised version was published in 2011. German director Werner Herzog has been developing a possible film adaptation of Vernon God Little based on a screenplay by Andrew Birkin.

Jungle on Tioman Island, Malaysia A jungle is land covered with dense forest and tangled vegetation, usually in tropical climates. Application of the term has varied greatly during the past recent centuries. Before the 1970s, tropical rainforests were generally referred to as jungles, but this terminology has fallen out of usage. Etymology The word jungle originates from the Sanskrit word ju·πÖgala (), meaning rough and arid. It came into the English language via Hindi in the 18th century. JƒÅ·πÖgala has also been variously transcribed in English as jangal, jangla, jungal, and ju·πÖgala. Although the Sanskrit word refers to dry land, it has been suggested that an Anglo-Indian interpretation led to its connotation as a dense \\"tangled thicket\\" while others have argued that a cognate word in Urdu did refer to forests. The term is prevalent in many languages of the Indian subcontinent, and the Iranian Plateau, where it is commonly used to refer to the plant growth replacing primeval forest or to the unkempt tropical vegetation that takes over abandoned areas. Wildlife Because jungles occur on all inhabited landmasses and may incorporate numerous vegetation and land types in different climatic zones, the wildlife of jungles can not be straightforwardly defined. Varying usage =As dense and tangled vegetation= Vine thicket, a typical tangled jungle, Australia One of the most common meanings of jungle is land overgrown with tangled vegetation at ground level, especially in the tropics. Typically such vegetation is sufficiently dense to hinder movement by humans, requiring that travellers cut their way through.Tropical Forests Mysterious Journey Nygren, A. 2006 Representations of Tropical Forests and Tropical Forest-Dwellers in Travel Accounts of ‚ÄòNational Geographic', Environmental Values 15 This definition draws a distinction between rainforest and jungle, since the understorey of rainforests is typically open of vegetation due to a lack of sunlight, and hence relatively easy to traverse. Jungles may exist within, or at the borders of, rainforests in areas where rainforest has been opened through natural disturbance such as hurricanes, or through human activity such as logging.Kricher JC. 1997. A neotropical companion: an introduction to the animals, plants, and ecosystems of the New World tropics, 2nd edn. New Jersey: Princeton University Press.Ecology L4.OO The successional vegetation that springs up following such disturbance of rainforest is dense and tangled and is a ‚Äòtypical‚Äô jungle. Jungle also typically forms along rainforest margins such as stream banks, once again due to the greater available light at ground level. Monsoon forests and mangroves are commonly referred to as jungles of this type. Having a more open canopy than rainforests, monsoon forests typically have dense understoreys with numerous lianas and shrubs making movement difficult,http://www.u.arizona.edu/~jrjurjev/Geo101_files/Forest_Biome[1][1].ppt while the prop roots and low canopies of mangroves produce similar difficulties.Holguin, G.

Frattura ed Integrit√† Strutturale 12 =As moist forest= Jungle lining a river bank in rainforest, Cameroon Because European explorers initially travelled through tropical rainforests largely by river, the dense tangled vegetation lining the stream banks gave a misleading impression that such jungle conditions existed throughout the entire forest. As a result, it was wrongly assumed that the entire forest was impenetrable jungle.Sterling, T. (1983). The Amazon: The World's Wild Places. Time-Life Books. New York This in turn appears to have given rise to the second popular usage of jungle as virtually any humid tropical forest.Purser, B. 2003. Jungle bugs: masters of camouflage and mimicry.

Indian Journal of Medical Research 18:1 with no reference to the vegetation structure or the ease of travel. The word \\"rainforest\\" has largely replaced \\"jungle\\" as the descriptor of humid tropical forests, a linguistic transition that has occurred since the 1970s. \\"Rainforest\\" itself did not appear in English dictionaries prior to the 1970s.Rogers, C. 2012 Jungle Fever: Exploring Madness and Medicine in Twentieth-Century Tropical Narratives. Vanderbilt University Press, Nashville. . The word \\"jungle\\" accounted for over 80% of the terms used to refer to tropical forests in print media prior to the 1970s; since then it has been steadily replaced by \\"rainforest\\",Slater, C (2003). In Search of the Rain Forest. Duke University Press although \\"jungle\\" still remains in common use when referring to tropical rainforests. = As metaphor = Use of the jungle to represent savageness and ferocity in popular culture. As a metaphor, jungle often refers to situations that are unruly or lawless, or where the only law is perceived to be \\"survival of the fittest\\". This reflects the view of \\"city people\\" that forests are such places. Upton Sinclair gave the title The Jungle (1906) to his famous book about the life of workers at the Chicago Stockyards, portraying the workers as being mercilessly exploited with no legal or other lawful recourse. The term \\"The Law of the Jungle\\" is also used in a similar context, drawn from Rudyard Kipling's The Jungle Book (1894)‚Äîthough in the society of jungle animals portrayed in that book and obviously meant as a metaphor for human society, that phrase referred to an intricate code of laws which Kipling describes in detail, and not at all to a lawless chaos. The word \\"jungle\\" itself carries connotations of untamed and uncontrollable nature and isolation from civilisation, along with the emotions that evokes: threat, confusion, powerlessness, disorientation and immobilisation.Fearing, F. (1963) \\"The problem of metaphor\\" Southern Journal of CommunicationJones, J. (1962) \\"The Thin Red Line\\". Dell Publishing New York The change from \\"jungle\\" to \\"rainforest\\" as the preferred term for describing tropical forests as has been a response to an increasing perception of these forests as fragile and spiritual places, a viewpoint not in keeping with the darker connotations of \\"jungle\\".Slater, C (2004).

Cultural Geographies 11:4Gustavson, E. 2007 \\"Rhetoric: How Politicians Manipulate Language and the Media to Shape Public Thought\\" Hinckley Journal of Politics 8 Cultural scholars, especially post-colonial critics, often analyse the jungle within the concept of hierarchical domination and the demand western cultures often places on other cultures to conform to their standards of civilisation. For example: Edward Said notes that the Tarzan depicted by Johnny Weissmuller was a resident of the jungle representing the savage, untamed and wild, yet still a white master of it; and in his essay \\"An Image of Africa\\" about Heart of Darkness Nigerian novelist and theorist Chinua Achebe notes how the jungle and Africa become the source of temptation for white European characters like Marlowe and Kurtz. Former Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak compared Israel to \\"a villa in the jungle\\" - a comparison which had been often quoted in Israeli political debates. Barak's critics on the left side of Israeli politics strongly criticised the comparison. For example, Uri Avnery charged that comparing \\"civilised\\" Israel with \\"a villa\\" and Israel's Arab neighbors with the \\"wild beasts\\" of the \\"jungle\\" tends to throw the blame for the absence of peace on the \\"wild\\" Arab and Palestinian side, and absolve Israel of responsibility.Uri Avnery, \\"Barak: A Villa in the Jungle\\", Gush Shalom website, July 7, 2007 ,Akiva Eldar, \\"The price of a villa in the jungle\\", Ha'aretz, Jan. 30, 2006 Larry Derfner, \\"Ehud Barak to step down: On his de- evolution, and Israel's\\", +972 Magazine, November 26, 2012 See also *Monsoon forest * Arid Forest Research Institute (AFRI) *Rainforest *Wilderness *Tropical vegetation  References  External links * BBC - Science and Nature: Jungle - * Jungle: Definition, Synonyms from Answers.com * Amazon Rainforest Fund - * Link illustrating Biomes - * Link Indonesia Rain Forest exploration and Jungle trek Guide Category:Forests Category:Metaphors ","title":"Jungle"},{"id":"341268","text":"Leunig is a surname.

Her jewelry and design pieces for Tiffany & Co., are included in the 20th century collection of the British Museum, the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston and the Museum of Fine Arts, Houston. In 1974 Peretti, the fashion model of Halston, Helmut Newton and Francesco Scavullo, arrived at Tiffany's with her modern jewelry. John Lorning's Tiffany Style - 170 Years of Design, devotes 18 pages of images of her jewelry and tableware design. She is largely responsible for the restoration of the village of Sant Mart√≠ Vell in Catalonia, Spain. Through her foundations, she supports a wide variety of cultural, social, and artistic causes.  Early life  Peretti was born in Florence, Italy as the youngest daughter of Ferdinando Peretti (1896‚Äì1977) and Maria Luisa Pighini. Ferdinando Peretti founded Anonima Petroli Italiana (API), a large Italian oil company, in 1933. She was estranged from her conservative family for much of her life. Elsa Peretti was educated in Rome and Switzerland. She initially made her living teaching Italian and working as a ski instructor in the German speaking Swiss mountain village of Gstaad. In 1963, she moved to Milan, Italy to pursue a degree in interior design and to work for the architect Dado Torrigiani.  Career  =Modeling= In 1964, Peretti became a fashion model, working in Barcelona, Spain. In 1968 she moved to New York City on the advice of Wilhelmina Modeling Agency. In the early 1970s, along with Karen Bjornson, Anjelica Huston, Alva Chinn, Pat Cleveland, and Pat Ast, among others, she became one of designer Halston's favoured troupe of models, nicknamed the Halstonettes. During the late 1970s Peretti was a frequent regular of Studio 54, along with designer Halston, Andy Warhol and Liza Minnelli. According to Halston, \\"Elsa had style: she made the dress she was modeling her own.\\" Helmut Newtons photograph ‚ÄòElsa Peretti in Bunny Costume‚Äô is considered a lasting image of the 1970s. =Jewelry design= In 1969, Peretti began creating new jewelry styles for a handful of fashion designers in Manhattan. Her first design was a two-inch bud vase made of sterling-silver, worn on a leather thong, that was inspired by a find at a flea market. Worn by one of Giorgio di Sant' Angelo's models, it was a hit. By 1971, she was designing jewelry for Halston. She continued to use silver, which went from being \\"common\\" to being a popular choice for Liza Minnelli and others. Pieces like Bone Cuff are seen as incorporating organic forms with appreciation of the human body, and as bridging a gap between costume and serious jewelry. Elsa Peretti, bowl with lid and tray, sterling silver, for Tiffany & Co., 1984 By the time Peretti joined Tiffany & Co. as an independent designer, she had received the 1971 Coty Award, and had her first appearance in Vogue magazine. In 1972 Bloomingdale's, one of New York's landmark shopping stores, opened a dedicated Peretti boutique. In 1974, Peretti signed a contract with Tiffany & Co to design silver jewelry and by 1979, she was the firm's leading designer. Her silver pieces were seen as \\"fun\\" and attracted a younger clientele. Peretti also designed silverware for Tiffany, but only after she had established a solid following with her jewelry. Peretti has designed over thirty collections for Tiffany. In the process, she has traveled to Japan, China, and Europe, drawing on the work of craftsmen there in the creation of classic collections such as Bean, Open Heart, Mesh, Bone, and Zodiac. In addition to sterling silver, part of her signature is the use of materials such as jade, lacquer, and rattan. In 2012,Tiffany and Peretti extended their partnership for another 20 years. In 2015, her trademarked Elsa Peretti designs represented eight percent of Tiffany's net sales. Her works have been described as \\"revolutionary\\", \\"timeless, distinct and modern\\".  Catalonia, Spain  In 1968, Peretti bought a house in the largely decrepit village of Sant Mart√≠ Vell in Catalonia, Spain. Over the next ten years she had the house restored, often living in rough conditions during the process. By the 1980s, the mustard-yellow house was her refuge and her preferred home. Pieces such as her scorpion necklace, now in the British Museum, were inspired by the flora and fauna of Sant Mart√≠ Vell. Since then Peretti has worked to restore parts of the surrounding village, purchasing additional buildings and having them renovated. As of 2017, about half the village had been rebuilt. Her projects have included the renovation of the interior of Esgl√©sia de Sant Mart√≠ Vell, the parochial church of Sant Mart√≠ Vell in 2012-2013. The site has a long history, encompassing a Roman settlement in the second century AD, a medieval enclosure, a Romanic Temple in the 11th‚Äì12th century and the construction of a late Gothic style edifice in the late 1500s. The work done has included the excavation of archaeological remains dating to a Roman settlement and the refinishing of a sepulchral tomb, as well as the restoration of existing elements and the provision of new ones. Peretti has also supported the management of the sixteenth-century historical documents of the town, the conservation of the photographic archive of Oriol Maspons and the conservation of the Roman city of Emp√∫ries. Peretti has established a working vineyard in Sant Mart√≠, planting Ca l‚ÄôElsa in 2004 and Can Nobas in 2007. The winery itself was completed in 2008, and fine wines are marketed under the Eccocivi label, meaning \\"Here we are to make wine.\\" Peretti has also provided a great deal of support to cultural, scientific, humanitarian and educational initiatives and for human rights. Much of this work has been supported through her foundations (see below). She has promoted the visual arts and fostered the consolidation, protection and dissemination of the historical, artistic, cultural, architectural and craft heritage of Catalonia. She has encouraged people such as guitarist Michael Laucke and painter-sculptor Robert Llim√≥s to make use of San Marti Vell. In 2013, Peretti was the first non-Catalan person to be awarded the National Culture Award by the National Council for Culture and the Arts (CoNCA).  Philanthropy  In 2000, she created a charity in honor of her father, called the Nando Peretti Foundation (NPF). The foundation is reported to have given approximately 42 million euros to 852 projects world-wide over 15 years. As of 2015, it was renamed the Nando and Elsa Peretti Foundation (NaEPF). Initially the foundation had a dual focus on the environment and wildlife conservation, and on humanitarian programs, particular those that targeted poverty. Over time, the scope of the foundation's work has expanded to support a broad range of projects for \\"promotion of human and civil rights, with a special emphasis on the right to education, children's rights, and women's rights and dignity.\\" The NPF solicits proposals internationally, and has supported requests from around the world. These include initiatives on behalf of unrepresented people and oppressed minorities, to defend their right to exist and preserve their culture. The NPF supports medical and scientific research projects to promote physical and mental health, as well as specific interventions including the building of hospitals and other sanitary facilities. It has funded public awareness campaigns for wildlife conservation and environmental protection. It also promotes culture and the arts.

Previously he has presented The Chris Moyles Show on BBC Radio 1 from 2004 to 2012 and Chris Moyles' Quiz Night from 2009 to 2012 on Channel 4. Moyles has worked at various radio stations, including Radio Luxembourg (under the pseudonym Chris Holmes) and Capital FM. Moyles moved to BBC Radio 1 in July 1997 and left the station in September 2012. He has presented the early breakfast show, a Saturday morning show, and the drive time show (from September 1998 to December 2003), before presenting the breakfast show from 5 January 2004 to 14 September 2012. In September 2009, he became BBC Radio 1's longest serving breakfast presenter.https://www.bbc.co.uk/newsbeat/article/19591322/chris-moyles- presents-his-last-radio-1-breakfast-show Moyles has become famous for his maverick bad-boy broadcasting style on BBC Radio 1 and has been embroiled in numerous controversies, including accusations of sexism and homophobia, due to statements he has made on the air and in the press. He frequently made appearances on several television shows including Hotel Babylon, a celebrity version of Dale's Supermarket Sweep, Top Gear, The Charlotte Church Show, The F-Word, The Friday Night Project, The One Show, Friday Night with Jonathan Ross, Richard & Judy and The Paul O'Grady Show. Early life and career Moyles was born in Leeds, West Riding of Yorkshire to Christopher, a postman and housewife Hannah Veronica ‚ÄúVera‚Äù Moyles, (from Dublin) and he was educated at Mount St Mary's Catholic High School.Moyles is highest paid DJ on radio ‚Äì Central Leeds. Yorkshire Evening Post. 13 April 2006. Retrieved 3 December 2011. While at school, he began his broadcasting career at WBHS (Wakefield's Broadcast to Hospitals Service), a voluntary staffed hospital radio station in the West Yorkshire city. After WBHS, Moyles moved to local radio station Aire FM as an assistant for DJ Carl Kingston. During this time, he was also a presenter on Radio Top Shop in the Leeds Briggate branch. After hosting his own Saturday Evening Show on Aire FM (and occasionally serving as a stand-in presenter), he was then employed as a presenter at Radio Luxembourg in 1992, until the station closed. In 1993, he gained a job at the Pulse of West Yorkshire, presenting the evening show from 7.00 pm‚Äì10.00 pm. He remained there until early 1994 when he was dismissedMoyles's autobiography The Gospel According to Chris Moyles for comments made about the station's previous programme controller. Moyles subsequently turned up at Signal 1 in Stoke-on- Trent ‚Äì again presenting The Evening Bit from 7.00 pm‚Äì10.00 pm. He remained there until he was dismissed by the station's programme controller, who he refers to as a \\"spineless bastard\\" in his first autobiography. In 1995 Moyles was heard on the Chiltern Radio Network, presenting the evening show from 7.00 pm‚Äì10.00 pm, before taking on the late show from 10.00 pm‚Äì1.00 am. This show was simulcast on Horizon Radio, Chiltern Radio, Severn Sound and Northants 96. In 1996, Moyles joined London station Capital FM hosting his weekend show 'The Late Bit', which went out on a Friday & Saturday evening, and covering for other DJs. It was at Capital that Moyles fell out with fellow DJ 'Doctor' Neil Fox. After declining the offer of presenting the breakfast show on rival station Kiss 100,Simon Garfield's Novel The Nation's Favourite Moyles joined Radio 1 in July 1997. Radio 1 Moyles was voted one of the Faces for 97 by SKY magazine and presented his first show on Radio 1 on 28 July 1997, hosting the 4.00 am‚Äì7.00 am Early Breakfast show ‚Äì soon called The Early Bit. In May 1998, his work was recognised with the award of the Silver Sony Awards DJ of the Year, and he was styling himself as 'The Saviour of Early Morning Radio'. Within the year Moyles was promoted to a Saturday breakfast, then Saturday mid-morning slot from 10.00 am‚Äì1.00 pm. At Radio 1, he presented most of his shows with David \\"Comedy Dave\\" Vitty, who worked behind the scenes at the station before Moyles' arrival. After standing in regularly for Kevin Greening and Zo√´ Ball on the Radio 1 Breakfast Show, Moyles's next promotion came in October 1998 when he took control of the drivetime show from 4.00 pm‚Äì5:45 pm. The show was extended to 3.00 pm‚Äì5:45 pm in February 2001. Moyles has co- presented the show from 1998 with his sidekick. On 5 January 2004, Moyles started presenting Radio 1's breakfast programme, named The Chris Moyles Show, switching places with Sara Cox. He had been appointed to increase the ratings for the show and did so, putting on an extra 1,000,000 listeners to the audience in the first quarter of 2004. After a successful first year, Moyles was awarded 'DJ of the Year' by readers of The Sun. By 2005, Moyles and his team had succeeded in increasing the morning audience, with his programme's audience swelling to 6.5 million. This was coupled with an increase in the overall Radio 1 audience share. With 895,000 listeners in London in the third quarter of 2005, he succeeded in overtaking Johnny Vaughan to take the position of the capital's most listened to youth breakfast show. Moyles's audience ratings continued to increase each week and led to him winning a gold Sony Radio Award in 2006 for best entertainment show. With the release of the RAJAR listening figures on 3 August 2006, Moyles had added a further 470,000 listeners to the Breakfast Show, taking the average listenership up to 6.79 million. On 10 May 2007, RAJAR figures confirmed that Moyles had increased his listening figures to 7.06 million, breaking the seven million barrier for the first time with the station having 10.55 million listeners overall. Moyles again increased his audience to 7.72 million as of 1 May 2008 slightly narrowing the gap between him and Terry Wogan, the current highest rated radio show in the UK. The station's overall listener figure is now over 11 million. On 12 May 2008 The Chris Moyles Show won its second Sony radio gold award for 'best breakfast show'.

On 7 September 2009 Moyles became the longest serving breakfast presenter on Radio 1, breaking the record previously set by Tony Blackburn. In March 2011, Moyles and his colleague Dave Vitty beat the record for the longest continuous Radio 1 show, on Radio 1's Longest Show Ever with Chris Moyles and Comedy Dave for Comic Relief. Between 16 and 18 March they beat both Simon Mayo's 1999 record of 37 hours and the 'Radio DJ Endurance Marathon (Team)' Guinness World Record by broadcasting for 52 hours for Comic Relief initially raising ¬£2.4 million, and with an audience of 2.84 million, it was the most popular live BBC Red Button radio feature ever. The event raised a final total of ¬£2,821,831. On 1 July 2011, it was announced that Moyles would remain within the BBC until at least 2012, ending speculation that he would move to a commercial rival. The deal was estimated to be worth ¬£1 million. This would have allowed the presenter to reach his 10-year anniversary on The Chris Moyles Show. However, on 11 July 2012, Moyles announced that he would be leaving the breakfast show and the station on 14 September. when Moyles was in negotiation with BBC Radio 1 about a new show. It was announced later the same day that Nick Grimshaw would replace him. Radio X On 7 September 2015, it was announced Chris Moyles would return to radio on the newly re-branded Radio X (previously XFM) hosting the new Chris Moyles Show. The show aired on 21 September 2015 from 6.30 am‚Äì10.00 am, returning to his former Breakfast slot and was going head to head with his BBC Radio 1 breakfast show replacement, Nick Grimshaw. Chris Moyles stated Dominic Byrne, who read the news on his BBC Radio 1 show, would return with him, as would producer Pippa Taylor. On 19 April 2016 it was announced that there would be an additional pre-recorded show on Saturday mornings between 8 am-11.00 am featuring clips from the week, interviews with studio guests plus new content, which means that Chris is on air on Radio X 6 days a week. Work outside radio Moyles with Gabby Logan during a campaign to promote life in Leeds =BT Red Nose Climb and Speaking Clock= Moyles was one of a team of celebrities who climbed Mount Kilimanjaro to raise money for Comic Relief reaching the summit on 7 March 2009. He was joined by his show's producers, Rachel Mallender and Pippa Taylor, and BBC Radio 1 controller, Andy Parfitt. Also on the climb were Girls Aloud members Cheryl Cole and Kimberley Walsh, Fearne Cotton, Ben Shephard, Gary Barlow, Ronan Keating, Denise Van Outen and Alesha Dixon. He recorded a parody song around this time to promote the climb, mentioning all the names of the people that were also taking part ‚Äì it was based on Lily Allen's \\"The Fear\\", and was called \\"(A month off of) The Beer\\". From 3 February ‚Äì 23 March 2009, Moyles was joined by Kimberley Walsh, Cheryl Cole, Gary Barlow, Ronan Keating, Ben Shephard and Fearne Cotton to help raise money for charity by reading the time on the Speaking Clock. =Film voice work= Moyles has provided his voice and/or likeness to a number of films and games. His face was used in 24: The Game, and his voice can be heard in the films Wimbledon, War of the Worlds and Robots.Chris Moyles at the IMDB. Retrieved 28 January 2006Chris Moyles biography chrismoyles.net; Harris Chris, 2006. Retrieved 28 January 2007 In some of these films, his voice was only used for the UK version. =Television presenting= Moyles has branched out his work into television. In 2002, his own Channel 5 show, Live With Chris Moyles, ran five shows a week for 13 weeks. Chris was replaced by Christian O'Connell, before the programme was shelved altogether. He and sidekick Dave Vitty had their own TV show, also entitled The Chris Moyles Show like their former Radio 1 show, which was aired from 1998‚Äì99 on the now-defunct UK satellite and cable channel UK Play. Moyles voiced the fourth and final series of Sky1 show The Villa and has occasionally presented Top of the Pops. He has also worked for the Comic Relief and Children in Need charities on their telecasts. Moyles has presented a number of episodes of Big Brother's Big Mouth. Daily Mirror journalist Rob Leigh once said of his Big Brother's Big Mouth presenting that \\"Chris Moyles may be Marmite for the ears on radio but never quite nails it on TV, even with his relative star power\\". He also presented The Big Breakfast on Channel 4 several times between 2000 and 2002. Moyles launched a new show on Channel 4, called Chris Moyles' Quiz Night on 22 March 2009. The show consists of Moyles alongside three other celebrities partaking in a traditional pub-style quiz. The original series had the four competing to win an item that belonged to Moyles but this has since developed into a more traditional quiz with the loser singing karaoke-style at the end of the show. The opening show received poor viewing figures attracting just 6% of total audience for the timeslot. It was continued for a second series between 26 February and 11 April 2010, a third series following between 1 November and 22 December 2010 and fourth between 15 July and 2 September 2011. After 5 series, the show was shelved. On 24 October 2011, The Metro announced that Moyles would co-present a new dating show, The Love Machine, alongside Stacey Solomon for Sky. Moyles confirmed this on his radio show that morning. =Other television appearances= Moyles appeared on the ITV show The X Factor: Battle of the Stars and had minor success. He was voted out of the show on 4 June 2006 in the semi-final. Following this appearance, stories in the New Statesman and The Sun both reported that Moyles was looking to relaunch his television career; rumours suggested that he had been offered his own show by ITV. Moyles has spoken of a desire to transfer the format of his radio show to the TV, but otherwise has thus far stayed clear of a conventional TV format. Moyles regularly appears on This Morning and Celebrity Juice. Moyles played himself in an episode of the drama Hotel Babylon which aired on 15 February 2007 and appeared on a celebrity version of Dale's Supermarket Sweep that broadcast on the same day. He has appeared as a guest on numerous British television shows, including the ninth series of Top Gear, Never Mind The Buzzcocks, which immortalised Moyles as an \\"oily pig in a dunce hat\\" The Charlotte Church Show, The F-Word, The Friday Night Project, Richard & Judy and The New Paul O'Grady Show. In 2008, Moyles appeared on the Brit Awards to present the award for the best live act, and appeared in the BBC documentary series Comedy Map of Britain. He has appeared on Channel 4's Big Brother: Celebrity Hijack TV programme as well as an appearance as a team captain on the Channel 4 show Alan Carr's Celebrity Ding Dong and on 18 July 2008 he appeared on Jimmy Carr's show on Channel 4, 8 Out of 10 Cats. On 23 February 2009, Chris was the guest on BBC One's The One Show to promote the BT Red Nose climb of Mount Kilimanjaro. He appeared again on the show on 26 February 2010 to talk about and promote the second series of Chris Moyles' Quiz Night. In July 2009, he featured in an episode of the genealogy documentary series Who Do You Think You Are? on BBC One where he explored his Irish ancestry. He visited Ireland and Belgium, where his great-grandfather fought and died in the First World War. On the programme Moyles discovered that his surname means bald servant from the Irish \\"√ì Maolmanach\\".CastRoller ‚Äì Best of Chris Moyles podcast He also co-presented Children in Need Rocks Manchester in November 2011. Moyles appeared on the quiz show The Million Pound Drop along with Andi Peters in February 2012, they won ¬£25,000 to divide between their chosen charities. Moyles appeared on Children in Need on 16 November 2012, performing Bring Me Sunshine on stage with holograms of famous comedy duo Morecambe and Wise in an effort to raise money for the charity. =Autobiography= Moyles' autobiography, The Gospel according to Chris Moyles: The Story of One Man and His Mouth was released by Ebury Press on 5 October 2006. On 4 October 2007 a follow-up book Chris Moyles: The Difficult Second Book, published by Ebury Press, was officially released. The Difficult Second Book was released in paperback on 1 May 2008. Stewart Lee, on his own programme Stewart Lee's Comedy Vehicle, commented that the title of the book suggests \\"a degree of irony and self-awareness largely absent from the text itself\\" and then went on to deconstruct and mock the book's contents. =Stage work= On 16 May 2012 it was announced that Chris Moyles had been cast to play the part of King Herod in an arena tour of Andrew Lloyd Webber's musical Jesus Christ Superstar. Moyles reprised his role as King Herod when Jesus Christ Superstar began another arena tour on 1 October 2013. Moyles also toured a solo stage show, \\"Chris Moyles Live\\". Presenting style Moyles uses zoo format, and therefore relies on his team members and audience participation for his show's games and quizzes and for other sources of comedy. He is renowned for his boorish manner, quick temper, and put-downs. It is this approach which most commonly leads to criticism of Moyles. It has also caused him to become involved in numerous controversies related to perceived offensive statements. However, Moyles generally accepts counter-attacks in the same manner and routinely derides himself for being overweight and so forth, often in the lyrics of jingles. Due to his fascination with radio, Moyles regularly discusses the process of making the show, often spoofing clich√©d radio practices. Many of his show's features are homages to or exaggerations of other radio features. Parody songs In December 2000, he parodied the Eminem song \\"Stan\\" that was No. 1 in the charts at the time, with a seasonal Christmas themed variation called \\"Stanta\\", instead. It became one of the most popular requested parodies and was often played more than once during the course of a show. In October 2004, Moyles and The Chris Moyles Show team replaced U2's \\"Vertigo\\" at number one in the UK Official Download Chart with their download-only charity song \\"Dogz Don't Kill People (Wabbitz Do)\\", under the name 'Mouldie Lookin' Stain'. The song was a spoof of Goldie Lookin' Chain's \\"Guns Don't Kill People Rappers Do\\" (itself a spoof rap song) and proceeds went to Comic Relief. At the time of its release, it was the fastest selling download on UK charts. Moyles has parodied several Kaiser Chiefs songs under the name \\"The Kaiser Chefs\\". These include \\"I Predict A Diet\\" (Parody of I Predict a Riot) and \\"Donny\\" (Parody of Ruby). Chris and Ricky Wilson of the Kaiser Chiefs (both Leeds United fans) said they had accidentally given Doncaster Rovers fans an unofficial anthem with \\"Donny\\" after Doncaster Rovers beat Leeds United 1‚Äì0 in the 2008 League One Play-off Final. During the 2006 FIFA World Cup in Germany, Chris organised a parody of England World Cup songs, to ridicule the number of songs there were out at the time. Listener favourite \\"Jose ‚Äì The Special One\\" a parody of \\"Ros√©\\" by The Feeling, was written on team manager Jos√© Mourinho's departure from Chelsea and was banned after Chelsea F.C. complained to the BBC (although subsequently played repeatedly on his show and on Radio 5 Live). He made a parody of \\"We Have Got to Zero Baby\\", a take on Enrique Iglesias's \\"Hero\\", which describes how his football team, Leeds United, managed to claw back a 15-point deficit in League One in only 5 games. In November 2007, he used Hoosiers ‚Äì \\"Goodbye Mr A\\" for \\"Goodbye Mr. M\\" where he sings about the Ex-England football manager Steve McClaren being sacked. Often Moyles will pick a track because of the silliness of its lyrics, for instance \\"Smile\\" by Lily Allen was parodied by Moyles's invention \\"Silly Allen\\", in a song called \\"Piles\\" and Natasha Bedingfield's \\"I Wanna Have Your Babies\\" written by Comedy Dave and performed in May 2007. In the same month, he performed a parody of Hellogoodbye's hit \\"Here\\" called \\"Beer in My Arms\\" in which he describes how much he really dislikes the song, calling it 'daft'. Moyles also covered Puretone \\"Addicted to Bass\\" with \\"Addicted to Plaice\\", which covers the subject of being addicted to fish. In September 2007, he performed \\"Suicidal\\" a parody of the UK number one Sean Kingston's \\"Beautiful Girls\\", in which he talks about how the song makes him feel suicidal and wonders why it reached number one. Although of 2008, UK's chart no.1 Basshunter was renamed \\"Chuffhunter\\" in which he mocks the song and those that would buy it, Kylie Minogue's \\"Bow Wow Wow\\" and a re-write of the Estelle song \\"American Boy\\", named \\"Somerset Boy\\". In the past, he has parodied include Billie Piper's \\"Honey to the Bee\\" as \\"Guinness For Me\\", All Seeing Eye's \\"Walk Like a Panther\\", Will Smith's \\"Gettin Jiggy Wit It\\", and McFly's \\"All About You\\" as \\"He Don't Use Shampoo\\". Moyles has also written Baked Beans, a parody of Same Jeans by The View, and \\"Lunch in this Pub\\", originally the Usher single \\"Love in this Club\\". One of his recent parodies, \\"No Hair\\" ‚Äì sung by \\"follicly-challenged\\" newscaster Dominic Byrne ‚Äì is a cover of Jordin Sparks's \\"No Air (ft Chris Brown)\\". Another two of Moyles' recent parodies are \\"Lorry Driver\\" which is a cover of Britney Spears' song \\"Womanizer\\" and \\"The Boy Does Plenty\\" by \\"Adrian Dixon\\", originally a song by Alesha Dixon, both of which are written by 'Comedy Dave' Vitty. In March 2009 Moyles released a parody song called \\"Dreaming of Debbie McGee\\". The song was about a man who has recurring dreams of the assistant on The Paul Daniels Magic Show. Comedy Dave wrote the song, and Paul Daniels asked for it to be made into an MP3 file after hearing it on air. It was a parody of the Kings of Leon song \\"Revelry\\". In April 2009, McGee recorded a reply which was played on air and was a parody of the same song called Dreaming of Moylesy. Moyles released \\"Waterproof\\" in July 2009, a parody of the La Roux song \\"Bulletproof\\". This song has an approved record deal to be used on a parody album, should Chris wish to do so. Moyles has released an album entitled The Parody Album. Recording began in September 2009, and the album was released on 23 November. The official Moyles Parody Album game entitled Parody Island was released to help promote the album and allow players to hear snippets from his new album. The Chris Moyles Show was credited with the debut of the unofficial England World Cup Song, written and performed by Chico Slimani a parody of his hit single \\"It's Chico Time\\" and originally named \\"It's England Time\\". Slimani recorded the single after having a 'vision' that England won the 2010 World Cup and that in the celebrations, commentators made reference to his song. The single debuted, Monday 8 February 2010. Controversies Moyles has come into conflict with the Broadcasting Standards Commission and Ofcom. These have occurred during his time at both Capital London and BBC Radio 1. For example, these regulatory bodies upheld complaints when Moyles threatened and bullied Neil Fox in October 2002 with the claim that \\"I'm gonna tear his head off and poo down his neck\\"; and also in early 2002, when he said \\"he would take the virginity of Charlotte Church\\", when she reached sixteen. When he first arrived at Radio 1, John Peel took an instant dislike to Moyles and accused him of being a \\"DLT-in-waiting\\". Moyles retorted that Peel was a \\"Kenny Everett-in-waiting, because Kenny Everett's dead and it's only a matter of time before John pops his clogs\\". In his biography Moyles said that he mended his relationship with Peel and felt a sense of loss that he had not got to know him before his death. In September 2008, Moyles, along with other British radio presenters, was criticised for on-air promotion of drinking to excess. =On-air profanity= In February 2006, Moyles apologised, along with the BBC, after swearing when speaking to a caller live on air. He made the outburst while teasing a mother-of-three from Newcastle during an on-air feature which her children had interrupted. \\"You've got three kids from some fuckin'...\\" he blurted out, before apologising profusely for his mistake. The BBC issued six apologies, adding that such mistakes could occur during live broadcasts such as Moyles' show. The BBC was later cleared by broadcasting regulator Ofcom over the incident. In July 2006, communications watchdog Ofcom found Moyles in Breach of rule 1.5 of the Ofcom Broadcasting Code Rules for an incident in which he referred to female listeners as \\"dirty whores\\". A listener objected to an item in which the presenter discussed people who urinated in the shower. He considered that the presenter's reference to women who did this as \\"dirty whores\\" was unacceptable at this time of the morning. =Pay fracas= Alongside a number of other BBC Radio 1 and BBC Radio 2 presenters, Moyles crossed a strike picketline in 2005. BBC staff were striking over recently announced job cuts. A report by the BBC Trust on 2 June 2008 revealed that Moyles was paid ¬£630,000 in 2007. However, Moyles revealed in September 2009 that he took a 20% pay cut three months earlier, quoting the reason \\"I want to work at the BBC, which is trying to save some of its gazillions\\". On 22 September 2010 Moyles spoke out on air about not being paid by the BBC in two months. =Accusations of homophobia= Moyles was accused of homophobia in May 2006, when he rejected a ringtone by saying \\"I don't want that one, it's gay\\", live on air. This led to a number of complaints to the BBC.They argued that the use of the word gay in this context was homophobic. The BBC governors said that Moyles was simply keeping up with developments in English usage. The Programme Complaints Committee said that, \\"The word 'gay', in addition to being used to mean 'homosexual' or 'carefree', was often now used to mean 'lame' or 'rubbish'. In describing a ringtone as gay, the DJ was conveying that he thought it was 'rubbish' rather than 'homosexual'. Moyles was not being homophobic.\\" The panel acknowledged, however, that this use of the word 'gay' in a derogatory sense could cause offence to some listeners and counselled caution on its use. Subsequently, in June, LGBT charity Stonewall marched with placards demanding the dismissal of Moyles during Europride in London. According to Stonewall, \\"Chris Moyles is not helping young LGBT people struggling to come out through his comments.\\" Stonewall gave Moyles the award of \\"Bully of the Year\\" at their annual Stonewall Awards that same year. Those defending Moyles have noted that Aled Haydn Jones, his show's producer who has worked with Moyles since 2001, is openly gay. He was quoted in The Guardian by Stonewall chief executive Ben Summerskill as saying \\"Yeah, I'm homophobic, I don't like the gays. Sorry, it just does my head in. We have a token gay on the show!\\" In his book The Difficult Second Book, Moyles says that he was responding to another article with sarcasm, and was subsequently quoted out of context. Moyles was censured by Ofcom following eight complaints made after a broadcast on 20 January 2009 in which he told listeners it was the birthday of Will Young and then went on to sing \\"Evergreen\\" and \\"Leave Right Now\\" in a high pitched and effeminate voice, changing the lyrics to references to Young's sexuality. Ofcom stated that the language used could have been \\"interpreted by listeners as promoting and condoning certain negative stereotypes based on sexual orientation\\" and whilst acknowledging the intention was to be humorous in their opinion it could have been perceived as hostile and pejorative. The media regulator also said in their view that because of the show's breakfast time slot that attracts a young audience it had the potential to encourage children to discriminate against others based on their actual or perceived sexual orientation and ran the risk of being imitated on the playground causing \\"unnecessary distress\\".\\"Broadcast Bulletin Issue number 130\\" , Ofcom, 23 March 2009. Retrieved 25 March 2009. =Auschwitz comments= On 20 January 2009, Moyles made comments on his radio show regarding the family history programme Who Do You Think You Are? and the Holocaust. Referring to his trips while filming the programme, Moyles said \\"I went off to Ireland and other places to film and unlike a lot of the Who Do You Think You Are? shows I didn't go to Auschwitz. Pretty much everyone goes there whether or not they're Jewish. They just seem to pass through there on their way to Florida\\". Celebrities featured on Who Do You Think You Are? including Stephen Fry, Jerry Springer and Natasha Kaplinsky, have traced their family histories back to Jews murdered by the Nazis during the Second World War. The BBC released a statement: ‚ÄúAnyone who listens to the Chris Moyles Show will know he has an irreverent style. However, we regret that on this occasion his comments were misjudged and we are speaking to Chris and his team about them.‚Äù =N-Dubz behaviour= On 12 January 2010, hip-hop trio N-Dubz appeared on the Chris Moyles Show on BBC Radio 1. The show received a text message from a female listener saying that band member Dappy was \\"vile\\" and \\"a little boy with a silly hat\\" and that N-Dubz were \\"losers\\". Dappy secretly copied her phone number from the studio console and sent abusive and threatening text messages to the woman the following day including one telling her she was \\"gonna die!\\". Moyles said of the resulting criticism: \\"I feel let down by him, I've supported them and said, 'Do you know what, N-Dubz aren't just a bunch of dippy chavs, they're really good.' So for him to go and do something like that is a bit rubbish.\\" =Tax avoidance= In 2012 Chris Moyles was involved in a tax avoidance schemeLittle dodgy, maybe by Mike Truman, Taxation, 5 March 2014. and requested a court order to prevent the press from reporting it, because he claimed it would infringe his human rights. In February 2014 it was reported that he had attempted to avoid up to ¬£400,000 in income tax by claiming losses of ¬£1,000,000 on a used car dealership scheme. Discography =Studio albums= * The Parody Album (2009) UK Chart No. 17 * The Difficult Second Album (2012) UK Chart No. 13 Awards and honours Moyles has won several Sony Radio Awards: Silver in 1998; Gold in 2006; nominated in 2007: Gold in 2008; Bronze in 2009; Silver in 2010; Bronze in 2011.

She has a particular interest in ancient Greek and Roman philosophy, political philosophy, existentialism, feminism, and ethics, including animal rights. She also holds associate appointments in classics, divinity, and political science, is a member of the Committee on Southern Asian Studies, and a board member of the Human Rights Program. She previously taught at Harvard and Brown.\\"Martha Nussbaum\\" , University of Chicago, accessed June 5, 2012. Nussbaum is the author of a number of books, including The Fragility of Goodness (1986), Cultivating Humanity: A Classical Defense of Reform in Liberal Education (1997), Sex and Social Justice (1998), Hiding from Humanity: Disgust, Shame, and the Law (2004), Frontiers of Justice: Disability, Nationality, Species Membership (2006), and From Disgust to Humanity: Sexual Orientation and Constitutional Law (2010). She received the 2016 Kyoto Prize in Arts and Philosophy and the 2018 Berggruen Prize. Early life and education Nussbaum was born on May 6, 1947, in New York City, the daughter of George Craven, a Philadelphia lawyer, and Betty Warren, an interior designer and homemaker. During her teenage years, Nussbaum attended The Baldwin School in Bryn Mawr. She described her upbringing as \\"East Coast WASP elite ... very sterile, very preoccupied with money and status\\".McLemee, Scott. The Chronicle of Higher Education. \\"What Makes Martha Nussbaum Run?\\" She would later credit her impatience with \\"mandarin philosophers\\" and dedication to public service as the \\"repudiation of my own aristocratic upbringing. I don't like anything that sets itself up as an in-group or an elite, whether it is the Bloomsbury group or Derrida\\".Boynton, Robert S. The New York Times Magazine. Who Needs Philosophy? A Profile of Martha Nussbaum After studying at Wellesley College for two years, dropping out to pursue theatre in New York, she studied theatre and classics at New York University, getting a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1969, and gradually moved to philosophy while at Harvard University, where she received a Master of Arts degree in 1972 and a Doctor of Philosophy degree in 1975, studying under G. E. L. Owen. Career When she became the first woman to hold the Junior Fellowship at Harvard, Nussbaum received a congratulatory note from a \\"prestigious classicist\\" who suggested that since \\"female fellowess\\" was an awkward name, she should be called hetaira, for in Greece these educated courtesans were the only women who participated in philosophical symposia.Nussbaum, Martha C. Cultivating Humanity: A Classical Defense of Reform in Liberal Education. Cambridge, MA: Cambridge University Press, 1997. pp. 6‚Äì7. Nussbaum with Iranian political activist Akbar Ganji in 2006 In the 1970s and early 1980 she taught philosophy and classics at Harvard, where she was denied tenure by the Classics Department in 1982. Nussbaum then moved to Brown University, where she taught until 1994 when she joined the University of Chicago Law School faculty. Her 1986 book The Fragility of Goodness, on ancient Greek ethics and Greek tragedy, made her a well-known figure throughout the humanities. At Brown, Nussbaum's students included philosopher Linda Mart√≠n Alcoff and actor and playwright Tim Blake Nelson. In 1987, she gained public attention due to her critique of fellow philosopher Allan Bloom's The Closing of the American Mind. More recent work (Frontiers of Justice) establishes Nussbaum as a theorist of global justice. Nussbaum's work on capabilities has often focused on the unequal freedoms and opportunities of women, and she has developed a distinctive type of feminism, drawing inspiration from the liberal tradition, but emphasizing that liberalism, at its best, entails radical rethinking of gender relations and relations within the family.Nussbaum, Martha. Women and Human Development. New York: Cambridge University Press, 2000. Nussbaum's other major area of philosophical work is the emotions. She has defended a neo-Stoic account of emotions that holds that they are appraisals that ascribe to things and persons, outside the agent's own control, great significance for the person's own flourishing. On this basis she has proposed analyses of grief, compassion, and love,Nussbaum, Martha C. Poetic Justice: Literary Imagination and Public Life. Boston: Beacon Press, 1995. and, in a later book, of disgust and shame.Nussbaum, Martha C. Hiding from Humanity: Shame, Disgust, and the Law. Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 2004. Nussbaum has engaged in many spirited debates with other intellectuals, in her academic writings as well as in the pages of semi-popular magazines and book reviews and, in one instance, when testifying as an expert witness in court. She testified in the Colorado bench trial for Romer v. Evans, arguing against the claim that the history of philosophy provides the state with a \\"compelling interest\\" in favor of a law denying gays and lesbians the right to seek passage of local non-discrimination laws. A portion of this testimony, dealing with the potential meanings of the term tolm√™ma in Plato's work, was the subject of controversy, and was called misleading and even perjurious by critics.The Stand by Daniel Mendelsohn, from Lingua Franca September 1996.Who Needs Philosophy?: A profile of Martha Nussbaum by Robert Boynton from The New York Times Magazine, November 21, 1999 Nussbaum at The School of Life, 2016 She responded to these charges in a lengthy article called \\"Platonic Love and Colorado Law\\".Martha C. Nussbaum. \\"Platonic Love and Colorado Law: The Relevance of Ancient Greek Norms to Modern Sexual Controversies\\" , Virginia Law Review, Vol. 80, No. 7 (Oct. 1994), pp. 1515‚Äì1651. Nussbaum used multiple references from Plato's Symposium and his interactions with Socrates as evidence for her argument. The debate continued with a reply by one of her sternest critics, Robert P. George.George, Robert P. '\\"Shameless Acts\\" Revisited: Some Questions for Martha Nussbaum', Academic Questions 9 (Winter 1995‚Äì96), 24‚Äì42. Nussbaum has criticized Noam Chomsky as being among the leftist intellectuals who hold the belief that \\"one should not criticize one's friends, that solidarity is more important than ethical correctness\\". She suggests that one can \\"trace this line to an old Marxist contempt for bourgeois ethics, but it is loathsome whatever its provenance\\". Among her academic colleagues whose books she has reviewed critically are Allan Bloom,Martha C. Nussbaum, Undemocratic Vistas , New York Review of Books, Volume 34, Number 17; November 5, 1987. Harvey Mansfield,Martha C.

What Babel? , Mises Review, Winter 1997 In January 2019, Nussbaum announced that she would be using a portion of her Berggruen Prize winnings to fund a series of roundtable discussions on controversial issues at the University of Chicago Law School. These discussions will be known as the Martha C. Nussbaum Student Roundtables. Personal life She was married to Alan Nussbaum from 1969 until they divorced in 1987, a period which also led to her conversion to Judaism, and the birth of her daughter Rachel. Nussbaum's interest in Judaism has continued and deepened: on August 16, 2008, she became a bat mitzvah in a service at Temple K. A. M. Isaiah Israel in Chicago's Hyde Park, chanting from the Parashah Va-etchanan and the Haftarah Nahamu, and delivering a D'var Torah about the connection between genuine, non-narcissistic consolation and the pursuit of global justice.\\"The Mourner's Hope: Grief and the Foundations of Justice\\", The Boston Review, November/December 2008., 18‚Äì20. Nussbaum's daughter Rachel predeceased her mother in 2019 due to a drug-resistant infection following successful transplant surgery.\\"In Memoriam ‚Äì Rachel Nussbaum Wichert,\\" Human Development and Capability Association. December 17, 2019. Nussbaum dated and lived with Cass Sunstein for more than a decade. They had been engaged to be wed. She had previously had a romantic relationship with Amartya Sen. Major works =The Fragility of Goodness= The Fragility of Goodness: Luck and Ethics in Greek Tragedy and PhilosophyNussbaum, Martha C. The Fragility of Goodness: Luck and Ethics in Greek Tragedy and Philosophy. New York: Cambridge University Press, 1986. confronts the ethical dilemma that individuals strongly committed to justice are nevertheless vulnerable to external factors that may deeply compromise or even negate their human flourishing. Discussing literary as well as philosophical texts, Nussbaum seeks to determine the extent to which reason may enable self-sufficiency. She eventually rejects the Platonic notion that human goodness can fully protect against peril, siding with the tragic playwrights and Aristotle in treating the acknowledgment of vulnerability as a key to realizing the human good. Her interpretation of Plato's Symposium in particular drew considerable attention. Under Nussbaum's consciousness of vulnerability, the re-entrance of Alcibiades at the end of the dialogue undermines Diotima's account of the ladder of love in its ascent to the non-physical realm of the forms. Alcibiades's presence deflects attention back to physical beauty, sexual passions, and bodily limitations, hence highlighting human fragility. Fragility brought attention to Nussbaum throughout the humanities. It garnered wide praise in academic reviews,Barnes, Hazel E. Comparative Literature, Vol. 40, No. 1 (Winter, 1988), pp. 76‚Äì77Woodruff, Paul B. Philosophy and Phenomenological Research, Vol. 50, No. 1 (Sep. 1989), pp. 205‚Äì210 and even drew acclaim in the popular media.Knox, Bernard. \\"The Theater of Ethics\\". The New York Review of Books Camille Paglia credited Fragility with matching \\"the highest academic standards\\" of the twentieth century,Paglia, Camille. Sex, Art, & American Culture. NY: Vintage Books, 1991. pp. 206 and The Times Higher Education called it \\"a supremely scholarly work\\".Hodges, Lucy. And you may ask yourself... Nussbaum's reputation extended her influence beyond print and into television programs like PBS's Bill Moyers. =Cultivating Humanity= Cultivating Humanity: A Classical Defense of Reform in Liberal EducationNussbaum, Martha C. Cultivating Humanity: A Classical Defense of Reform in Liberal Education. Cambridge, MA: Cambridge University Press, 1997. appeals to classical Greek texts as a basis for defense and reform of the liberal education. Noting the Greek cynic philosopher Diogenes' aspiration to transcend \\"local origins and group memberships\\" in favor of becoming \\"a citizen of the world\\", Nussbaum traces the development of this idea through the Stoics, Cicero, and eventually the classical liberalism of Adam Smith and Immanuel Kant. Nussbaum champions multiculturalism in the context of ethical universalism, defends scholarly inquiry into race, gender, and human sexuality, and further develops the role of literature as narrative imagination into ethical questions. At the same time, Nussbaum also censured certain scholarly trends. She excoriated deconstructionist Jacques Derrida saying \\"on truth [he is] simply not worth studying for someone who has been studying Quine and Putnam and Davidson\\". She cites Zhang Longxi, who labels Derrida's analysis of Chinese culture \\"pernicious\\" and without \\"evidence of serious study\\".Nussbaum, Martha C. Cultivating Humanity: A Classical Defense of Reform in Liberal Education. Cambridge, MA: Cambridge University Press, 1997. pages 41 & 126. More broadly, Nussbaum criticized Michel Foucault for his \\"historical incompleteness [and] lack of conceptual clarity\\", but nevertheless singled him out for providing \\"the only truly important work to have entered philosophy under the banner of 'postmodernism.'\\"Nussbaum, Martha C. Cultivating Humanity: A Classical Defense of Reform in Liberal Education. Cambridge, MA: Cambridge University Press, 1997. p.40 Nussbaum is even more critical of figures like Allan Bloom, Roger Kimball, and George Will for what she considers their \\"shaky\\" knowledge of non-Western cultures and inaccurate caricatures of today's humanities departments. The New York Times praised Cultivating Humanity as \\"a passionate, closely argued defense of multiculturalism\\" and hailed it as \\"a formidable, perhaps definitive defense of diversity on American campuses\\".Shapiro, James. Beyond the Culture Wars. The New York Times Nussbaum was the 2002 recipient of the University of Louisville Grawmeyer Award in Education. =Sex and Social Justice= Sex and Social Justice sets out to demonstrate that sex and sexuality are morally irrelevant distinctions that have been artificially enforced as sources of social hierarchy; thus, feminism and social justice have common concerns. Rebutting anti-universalist objections, Nussbaum proposes functional freedoms, or central human capabilities, as a rubric of social justice.Nussbaum, Martha C. Sex & Social Justice. New York: Oxford University Press, 1999. pp. 29‚Äì47. Nussbaum discusses at length the feminist critiques of liberalism itself, including the charge advanced by Alison Jaggar that liberalism demands ethical egoism. Nussbaum notes that liberalism emphasizes respect for others as individuals, and further argues that Jaggar has elided the distinction between individualism and self-sufficiency. Nussbaum accepts Catharine MacKinnon's critique of abstract liberalism, assimilating the salience of history and context of group hierarchy and subordination, but concludes that this appeal is rooted in liberalism rather than a critique of it.Nussbaum, Martha C. Sex & Social Justice. New York: Oxford University Press, 1999. pp. 55‚Äì80. Nussbaum condemns the practice of female genital mutilation, citing deprivation of normative human functioning in its risks to health, impact on sexual functioning, violations of dignity, and conditions of non-autonomy. Emphasizing that female genital mutilation is carried out by brute force, its irreversibility, its non-consensual nature, and its links to customs of male domination, Nussbaum urges feminists to confront female genital mutilation as an issue of injustice.Nussbaum, Martha C. Sex & Social Justice. New York: Oxford University Press, 1999. pp. 118‚Äì130. Nussbaum also refines the concept of \\"objectification\\", as originally advanced by Catharine MacKinnon and Andrea Dworkin. Nussbaum defines the idea of treating as an object with seven qualities: instrumentality, denial of autonomy, inertness, fungibility, violability, ownership, and denial of subjectivity. Her characterization of pornography as a tool of objectification puts Nussbaum at odds with sex-positive feminism. At the same time, Nussbaum argues in support of the legalization of prostitution, a position she reiterated in a 2008 essay following the Spitzer scandal, writing: \\"The idea that we ought to penalize women with few choices by removing one of the ones they do have is grotesque.\\"Martha Nussbaum, \\"Trading on America's puritanical streak \\", The Atlanta Journal-Constitution, March 14, 2008 Sex and Social Justice was highly praised by critics in the press. Salon declared: \\"She shows brilliantly how sex is used to deny some people‚Äîi.e., women and gay men‚Äîsocial justice.\\" The New York Times praised the work as \\"elegantly written and carefully argued\\". Kathryn Trevenen praised Nussbaum's effort to shift feminist concerns toward interconnected transnational efforts, and for explicating a set of universal guidelines to structure an agenda of social justice.Trevenen, Kathryn. \\"Global Feminism and the 'Problem' of Culture\\". Theory & Event 5.1 (2001). Patrick Hopkins singled out for praise Nussbaum's \\"masterful\\" chapter on sexual objectification.Hopkins, Patrick D. \\"Sex and Social Justice\\". Hypatia 17.2 (2002): 171‚Äì173. Radical feminist Andrea Dworkin faulted Nussbaum for \\"consistent over-intellectualisation of emotion, which has the inevitable consequence of mistaking suffering for cruelty\\".Dworkin, Andrea R. \\"Rape is not just another word for suffering\\". Times Higher Education. August 4, 2000. =Hiding from Humanity= Hiding from HumanityNussbaum, Martha C. Hiding from Humanity: Disgust, Shame, and the Law. Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 2004. extends Nussbaum's work in moral psychology to probe the arguments for including two emotions‚Äîshame and disgust‚Äîas legitimate bases for legal judgments. Nussbaum argues that individuals tend to repudiate their bodily imperfection or animality through the projection of fears about contamination. This cognitive response is in itself irrational, because we cannot transcend the animality of our bodies. Noting how projective disgust has wrongly justified group subordination (mainly of women, Jews, and homosexuals), Nussbaum ultimately discards disgust as a reliable basis of judgment. Nussbaum in 2004 Turning to shame, Nussbaum argues that shame takes too broad a target, attempting to inculcate humiliation on a scope that is too intrusive and limiting on human freedom. Nussbaum sides with John Stuart Mill in narrowing legal concern to acts that cause a distinct and assignable harm. In an interview with Reason magazine, Nussbaum elaborated: Nussbaum's work was received with wide praise. The Boston Globe called her argument \\"characteristically lucid\\" and hailed her as \\"America's most prominent philosopher of public life\\".Wilson, John. You Stink therefore I am.The Boston Globe Her reviews in national newspapers and magazines garnered unanimous praise. In academic circles, Stefanie A. Lindquist of Vanderbilt University lauded Nussbaum's analysis as a \\"remarkably wide ranging and nuanced treatise on the interplay between emotions and law\\". A prominent exception was Roger Kimball's review published in The New Criterion,Kimball, Roger. The New Criterion.Does Shame have a Future? in which he accused Nussbaum of \\"fabricating\\" the renewed prevalence of shame and disgust in public discussions and says she intends to \\"undermine the inherited moral wisdom of millennia\\". He rebukes her for \\"contempt for the opinions of ordinary people\\" and ultimately accuses Nussbaum herself of \\"hiding from humanity\\". Nussbaum has recently drawn on and extended her work on disgust to produce a new analysis of the legal issues regarding sexual orientation and same-sex conduct. Her book From Disgust to Humanity: Sexual Orientation and the Constitution was published by Oxford University Press in 2009, as part of their \\"Inalienable Rights\\" series, edited by Geoffrey Stone. =From Disgust to Humanity= In her 2010 book From Disgust to Humanity: Sexual Orientation and Constitutional Law, Nussbaum analyzes the role that disgust plays in law and public debate in the United States.Nussbaum, Martha. Oxford University Press. \\"From Disgust to Humanity: Sexual Orientation and Constitutional Law\\" (2010) The book primarily analyzes constitutional legal issues facing gay and lesbian Americans but also analyzes issues such as anti-miscegenation statutes, segregation, antisemitism and the caste system in India as part of its broader thesis regarding the \\"politics of disgust\\". Nussbaum in 2010 Nussbaum posits that the fundamental motivations of those advocating legal restrictions against gay and lesbian Americans is a \\"politics of disgust\\". These legal restrictions include blocking sexual orientation being protected under anti-discrimination laws (see Romer v. Evans), sodomy laws against consenting adults (See: Lawrence v. Texas), constitutional bans against same- sex marriage (See: California Proposition 8 (2008)), over-strict regulation of gay bathhouses, and bans on sex in public parks and public restrooms.For the last two, see Martha Nussbaum, From Disgust to Humanity: Sexual Orientation and Constitutional Law. Oxford University Press, 2010, 198‚Äì199. Nussbaum also argues that legal bans on polygamy and certain forms of incestuous (e.g. brother‚Äìsister) marriage partake of the politics of disgust and should be overturned.Nussbaum, From Disgust to Humanity, 154‚Äì155. She identifies the \\"politics of disgust\\" closely with Lord Devlin and his famous opposition to the Wolfenden report, which recommended decriminalizing private consensual homosexual acts, on the basis that those things would \\"disgust the average man\\". To Devlin, the mere fact some people or act may produce popular emotional reactions of disgust provides an appropriate guide for legislating. She also identifies the 'wisdom of repugnance' as advocated by Leon Kass as another \\"politics of disgust\\" school of thought as it claims that disgust \\"in crucial cases ... repugnance is the emotional expression of deep wisdom, beyond reason's power fully to articulate it\\". Nussbaum goes on to explicitly oppose the concept of a disgust-based morality as an appropriate guide for legislating. Nussbaum notes that popular disgust has been used throughout history as a justification for persecution. Drawing upon her earlier work on the relationship between disgust and shame, Nussbaum notes that at various times, racism, antisemitism, and sexism, have all been driven by popular revulsion. In place of this \\"politics of disgust\\", Nussbaum argues for the harm principle from John Stuart Mill as the proper basis for limiting individual liberties. Nussbaum argues the harm principle, which supports the legal ideas of consent, the age of majority, and privacy, protects citizens while the \\"politics of disgust\\" is merely an unreliable emotional reaction with no inherent wisdom. Furthermore, Nussbaum argues this \\"politics of disgust\\" has denied and continues to deny citizens humanity and equality before the law on no rational grounds and causes palpable social harms to the groups affected. From Disgust to Humanity earned acclaim in the United States,San Francisco Book Review and prompted interviews in The New York Times and other magazines. One conservative magazine, The American Spectator, offered a dissenting view, writing: \\"[H]er account of the 'politics of disgust' lacks coherence, and 'the politics of humanity' betrays itself by not treating more sympathetically those opposed to the gay rights movement.\\" The article also argues that the book is marred by factual errors and inconsistencies.

In 1947, she became one of the first prominent Nazis tried by the U.S. military. After the trial received worldwide media attention, survivor accounts of her actions resulted in other authors describing her abuse of prisoners as sadistic, and the image of her as \\"the concentration camp murderess\\" was current in post-war German society. She was accused of taking souvenirs from the skin of murdered inmates with distinctive tattoos, although those claims were rejected at both of her trials. She was known as \\"The Witch of Buchenwald\\" (Die Hexe von Buchenwald) by the inmates because of her cruelty and lasciviousness toward prisoners. In English, she is referred to as: \\"The Beast of Buchenwald\\", \\"Queen of Buchenwald\\", \\"Red Witch of Buchenwald\\", \\"Butcher Widow\\", and more commonly, \\"The Bitch of Buchenwald\\". Early life Koch was born Margarete Ilse K√∂hler in Dresden, Germany, the daughter of a former military commander. She was known as a polite and happy child in her elementary school. At the age of 15, she entered an accountancy school. Later, she entered employment as a bookkeeping clerk. At the time the economy of Germany had not yet recovered from defeat in World War I. In 1932, she became a member of the Nazi Party. Through some friends in the SA and SS, she met Karl-Otto Koch in 1934. Buchenwald 16 April 1945.

In 1936, she began working as a guard and secretary at the Sachsenhausen concentration camp near Berlin, where her fianc√© was the Commandant. The couple married the same year. In 1937, her husband was posted to Buchenwald. War crimes While at Buchenwald, Koch allegedly engaged in gruesome experiments; selected tattooed prisoners were murdered and skinned to retrieve the tattooed parts of their bodies. This was allegedly done to help a prison doctor, , in his dissertation on tattooing and criminality.\\"The most evil women in history\\". Discovery Channel, 2001. In 1940, she built an indoor sports arena, which cost over 250,000 reichsmarks (approximately $62,500), most of which had been seized from the inmates. In 1941, Karl-Otto Koch was transferred to Lublin, where he helped establish the Majdanek concentration and extermination camp. Ilse Koch remained at Buchenwald until 24 August 1943, when she and her husband were arrested on the orders of Josias von Waldeck- Pyrmont, SS and Police Leader for Weimar, who had supervisory authority over Buchenwald. The charges against the Kochs comprised private enrichment, embezzlement, and the murder of prisoners to prevent them from giving testimony. The author notes the irony that the SS prosecutor, Konrad Morgen, investigated some cover-up murders of inmates in detail while being ignorant of, or willfully ignoring, the industrialized mass murder in the camps further to the east. Ilse Koch was imprisoned until 1944 when she was acquitted for lack of evidence. Her husband was found guilty and sentenced to death by an SS court in Munich, and was executed by firing squad on 5 April 1945 in the court of the camp he once commanded. She then lived with her surviving family in the town of Ludwigsburg, where she was arrested by U.S. authorities on 30 June 1945. First trial Dachau, 1947 Koch and 30 other accused were arraigned before the American military court at Dachau (General Military Government Court for the Trial of War Criminals) in 1947. Prosecuting her was future United States Court of Claims Judge Robert L. Kunzig. She was charged with \\"participating in a criminal plan for aiding, abetting and participating in the murders at Buchenwald\\". Koch stated in the courtroom that she was eight months pregnant but on 19 August 1947, she was sentenced to life imprisonment for \\"violation of the laws and customs of war\\". Reduction of sentence Gen. Lucius D. Clay, then interim military governor of the American Zone in Germany, reduced the judgment to four years' imprisonment on 8 June 1948, after she had served two years of her sentence, on the grounds that \\"there was no convincing evidence that she had selected inmates for extermination in order to secure tattooed skins, or that she possessed any articles made of human skin\\". The reduction of the sentence resulted in an uproar, when it was made public on 16 September 1948, but Clay stood firm by his decision, maintaining that the leather lamp shades were really made out of goat skin.Jean Edward Smith, Lucius D. Clay: An American Life. Years later Clay stated: The Buchenwald Memorial Foundation states that: Second trial Under the pressure of public opinion, Koch was re-arrested in 1949 and tried before a West German court. The hearing opened on 27 November 1950 before the District Court at Augsburg and lasted seven weeks, during which 250 witnesses were heard, including 50 for the defense. Koch collapsed and had to be carried from the court in late December 1950, and again on 11 January 1951. At least four witnesses for the prosecution testified that they had seen Koch choose tattooed prisoners, who were then killed, or had seen or been involved in the process of making human-skin lampshades from tattooed skin. However, this charge was dropped by the prosecution when they could not prove lampshades or any other items were actually made from human skin. On 15 January 1951, the Court pronounced its verdict, in a 111-page-long decision, for which Koch was not present in court. It was concluded that the previous trials in 1944 and 1947 were not a bar to proceedings under the principle of ne bis in idem, as at the 1944 trial Koch had only been charged with receiving, while in 1947 she had been accused of crimes against foreigners after 1 September 1939, and not with crimes against humanity of which Germans and Austrians had been defendants both before and after that date. She was convicted of charges of incitement to murder, incitement to attempted murder and incitement to the crime of committing grievous bodily harm, and on 15 January 1951 was sentenced to life imprisonment and permanent forfeiture of civil rights. On 10 May 1950 Koch was indicted by Dr. Hans Ilkow, chief prosecutor at the superior court in Augsburg. On 15 June 1951, Koch officially started her life imprisonment sentence. Koch appealed to have the judgment quashed, but the appeal was dismissed on 22 April 1952 by the Federal Court of Justice. She later made several petitions for a pardon, all of which were rejected by the Bavarian Ministry of Justice. Koch protested her life sentence, to no avail, to the International Human Rights Commission. Family Karl and Ilse Koch had two sons, one of whom committed suicide after the war \\"because he couldn't live with the shame of the crimes of his parents.\\" Another son, Uwe, conceived in her prison cell at Dachau with a fellow German prisoner, was born in the Aichach prison near Dachau where Koch was sent to serve her life sentence and was immediately taken from her. At the age of 19, Uwe K√∂hler learned that Koch was his mother and began visiting her regularly at Aichach. Suicide Koch hanged herselfNorman Polmar, Thomas B. Allen: World War II: the Encyclopedia of the War Years, 1941‚Äì1945, Publisher Courier Corporation, 2012, p. 476 at Aichach women's prison on 1 September 1967 at age 60. She suffered from delusions and had become convinced that concentration camp survivors would abuse her in her cell.Nikolas Wachsmann, 'KL: A History of the Nazi Concentration Camps' (New York: F, S & G, 2015), p. 618, citing a Feb. 1967 note in her prison file. In 1971, her son Uwe sought posthumous rehabilitation for his mother. Uwe was determined to clear his mother's name after her death in 1967. Through his usage of the press, he used clemency documents from her former lawyer in 1957 and his impression of her based on their relationship in an attempt to rewrite people's attitude towards Koch. In popular culture * Woody Guthrie wrote \\"Ilsa Koch\\", a song about her abuses in Buchenwald, her imprisonment and release; it was recorded by The Klezmatics. * Koch was the inspiration for a series of Nazi exploitation films,Ryan M Niemiec, Danny Wedding: Positive Psychology at the Movies: Using Films to Build Virtues and Character Strengths, Publisher Hogrefe Publishing, 2013 , p. 209 such as Ilsa, She Wolf of the SS (1975). * The British label Come Organisation released a noise music compilation F√ºr Ilse Koch (wdc881021) in 1982 featuring bands Nurse with Wound, Consumer Electronics, Etat Brut, Club Moral (wrongly listed as \\"Wiking DDV\\"), Whitehouse and others. *Koch's life inspired the movie The Bitch of Buchenwald directed by Gerry Malir and narrated by Peter Morgan Jones. The documentary was released in 2009 to detail the life and crimes of Ilse Koch. It includes embezzlement, sadism, and humanity crimes. *There were numerous books written, including the limited series The Buchenwald trilogy. The very first of the series, titled The Beasts of Buchenwald: Karl & Ilse Koch, Human-skin Lampshades, and the War-crimes Trial of the Century, explored official crimes, accusations, as well as life outside of the concentration camps for Ilse and Karl Koch.

Origin and name According to the Encyclopedia Iranica, \\"sources differ regarding his original name and his origin. Some make him a descendant of G≈çdarz and of the vizier Bozorgmehr and call him EbrƒÅhƒ´m; some name him BehzƒÅdƒÅn, son of VendƒÅd Hormoz (); and others relate him to the  øAbbasids or to  øAlƒ´‚Äôs family. These suggestions are all doubtful\\".. He was most likely of Persian origin,. and was born in either Marw or near Isfahan. The exact date is unknown, either in 718/9 or sometime in 723/7. Other sources refer to him as a Yaminite, a Kurd, an Arab or even a descendant of the ancient Iranian aristocracy. It is also said that he was born in Sar-e Pol Province of present-day Afghanistan to a Tajik family.Abu Muslim Khurasani, Conflict and Conquest in the Islamic World: A Historical Encyclopedia, Volume 1, ed. Alexander Mikaberidze, (ABC-CLIO, 2011), 23.Florian Illerhaus: \\"Haschimitische Propaganda. Bedingungen f√ºr den Erfolg der abbasidischen Revolution\\" (German). Munich, 2011. Shia activist and missionary activity in Khurasan He grew up at Kufa, where he served as a slave and saddler of the Banu Ijil clan It was there that Abu Muslim came into contact with Shia Muslims. Kufa at the time was a hotbed of social and political unrest against the ruling Umayyad dynasty, whose policies favoured Arabs over non-Arab converts to Islam (mawƒÅlƒ´) and were thus perceived to violate the Islamic promises of equality. The luxurious lifestyles of the Umayyad caliphs and their persecution of the Alids further alienated the pious. This rallied support for the Shi'a cause of rule by a member of the family of Muhammad, who would, as a God-guided imƒÅm or mahdƒ´, rule according to the Quran and the Sunnah and create a truly Islamic government that would bring justice and peace to the Muslim community. By 737 he is recorded among the followers of the ghƒÅlƒ´ (\\"extremist, heterodox\\") al-Mughira ibn Sa'id. These activities landed him in prison, from where he was liberated in 741/2 by the leading Abbasid missionaries (naqƒÅb, sing. naqƒ´b) on their way to Mecca. He was introduced to the head of the Abbasid clan, Ibrahim ibn Muhammad, who in 745/6 sent him to direct the missionary effort in Khurasan. Khurasan, and the Iranian eastern half of the Caliphate in general, offered fertile ground for the Abbasids' missionary activities. Far from the Umayyad metropolitan province of Syria, Khurasan had a distinct identity. It was home to a large Arab settler community, which in turn had resulted in a large number of native converts, as well as intermarriage between Arabs and Iranians. As a frontier province exposed to constant warfare, the local Muslims were militarily experienced, and the common struggle had helped further unify the Arab and native Muslims of Khurasan, with a common dislike towards the centralizing tendencies of Damascus and the exactions of the Syrian governors. According to later accounts, already in 718/9 the Abbasids had dispatched twelve naqƒÅb into the province, but modern scholars are sceptical of such claims, and it appears that only after the failure of the Revolt of Zayd ibn Ali in 740 did the Abbasid missionary movement begin to make headway in Khurasan. In 745, the Khurasani Qahtaba ibn Shabib al-Ta'i travelled west to swear allegiance to Ibrahim ibn Muhammad, and it was with him that Abu Muslim was sent east to assume control. When Abu Muslim arrived in Khurasan, the province was in turmoil due to the impact of the ongoing Umayyad civil war of the Third Fitna, which had re-ignited the feud between the Yaman and Qays tribal groups: the numerous Yamani element in the province opposed the longtime governor, Nasr ibn Sayyar, and sought to replace him with their champion, Juday al-Kirmani. Al-Kirmani led an uprising against Ibn Sayyar, and drove him from the provincial capital, Merv, in late 746, with the governor fleeing to the Qaysi stronghold of Nishapur. Abu Muslim and the Abbasid Revolution He took Merv in December 747 (or January 748), defeating the Umayyad governor Nasr ibn Sayyar, as well as Shayban al-Khariji, a Kharijite aspirant to the caliphate. He became the de facto governor of Khurasan, and gained fame as a general in the late 740s in defeating the rebellion of Bihafarid, the leader of a syncretic Persian sect that was Mazdaist. Abu Muslim received support in suppressing the rebellion both from purist Muslims and Zoroastrians. In 750, Abu Muslim became leader of the Abbasid army and defeated the Umayyads at Battle of the Zab. Rule of Khurasan and relations with al-Mansur After the establishment of the Abbasid regime, Abu Muslim remained in Khurasan as its governor. In this role he suppressed the Shi'a uprising of Sharik ibn Shaikh al-Mahri in Bukhara in 750/1, and furthered the Muslim conquest of Central Asia, sending Abu Da'ud Khalid ibn Ibrahim to campaign in the east. His heroic role in the revolution and military skill, along with his conciliatory politics toward Shia, Sunnis, Zoroastrians, Jews, and Christians, made him extremely popular among the people. Although it appears that Abu al-'Abbas al- Saffah trusted him in general, he was wary of his power, limiting his entourage to 500 men upon his arrival to Iraq on his way to Hajj in 754. Abu al-'Abbas's brother, al-Mansur (r. 754-775), advised al-Saffah on more than one occasion to have Abu Muslim killed, fearing his rising influence and popularity. It seems that this dislike was mutual, with Abu Muslim aspiring to more power and looking down in disdain on al-Mansur, feeling al-Mansur owed Abu Muslim for his position. When the new caliph's uncle, Abdullah ibn Ali rebelled, Abu Muslim was requested by al-Mansur to crush this rebellion, which he did, and Abdullah was given to his nephew as a prisoner. Abdullah was ultimately executed. Relations deteriorated quickly when al-Mansur sent an agent to inventorize the spoils of war, and then appointed Abu Muslim governor of Syria and Egypt, outside his powerbase. After an increasingly acrimonious correspondence between Abu Muslim and al-Mansur, Abu Muslim feared he was going to be killed if he appeared in the presence of the Caliph. He later changed his mind and decided to appear in his presence due to a combination of perceived disobedience, al-Mansur's promise to keep him as governor of Khurasan, and the assurances of some of his close aides, some of whom were bribed by al-Mansur. He went to Iraq to meet al-Mansur in al-Mada'in in 755. Al-Mansur proceeded to enumerate his grievances against Abu Muslim, who kept reminding the Caliph of his efforts to enthrone him. Against Abu Muslim were also charges of being a zindiq or heretic. al-Mansur then signaled five of his guards behind a portico to kill him. Abu Muslim's mutilated body was thrown in the river Tigris, and his commanders were bribed to acquiesce to the murder. Death His murder was not well received by the residents of Khurasan, and there was resentment and rebellion among the population over the brutal methods used by Al-Mansur. He became a legendary figure for many in Persia, and several Persian heretics started revolts claiming he had not died and would return; the latter included his own propagandist Ishaq al-Turk, the Zoroastrian cleric Sunpadh in Nishapur, the Abu Muslimiyya subsect of the Kaysanites Shia, and al-Muqanna in Khurasan. Even Babak claimed descent from him. There are different variations of legends about Abu Muslim and forms of his worship in Central Asia, Iran and Afghanistan. Depending on particular local traditions, some local saints are legitimized through an imaginary connection with Abu Muslim.Malikov Azim.

Biography Phuong Ngo was born in South Vietnam to wealthy parents and following university became a schoolteacher. Following the fall of Saigon and the end of the Vietnam War, his family had their assets confiscated. Ngo made several unsuccessful attempts to flee the country and was jailed several times. In January 1981 he made his thirteenth attempt, which was successful, and he arrived in Australia via Malaysia as a refugee in 1982. Ngo rose rapidly in local politics. On 8 October 1987, he was elected to the city council of Fairfield, New South Wales, making him the first Vietnamese-born Australian to enter local government. The following year he partnered Rodney Adler to set up Asia Press Pty Ltd, which published Dan Viet, a Vietnamese language newspaper. As a city councillor, Ngo worked to help members of the Vietnamese Australian community and, after arranging for Adler to invest $1 million, led the redevelopment of the local community centre, the Mekong Club. He was subsequently asked to be the club's president. From July 1990 to June 1993, Ngo served as a Commissioner of the NSW Ethnic Affairs Commission (EAC Annual Report 1991-1992). In 1990, he was elected deputy mayor of Fairfield. The following year, Ngo stood as an independent for the seat of Cabramatta, which he lost to Labor's John Newman. After his friend and council ally, Nick Lalich, approached Federal MP Ted Grace for Ngo to join Labor, Grace arranged a meeting with Senator Graham Richardson and Leo McLeay, Federal MP for Watson and Speaker of the House of Representatives. They decided that if Ngo was promoted to the Legislative Council (MLC), he could be a potential \\"counter\\" to the Liberal Party's Asian MLC Helen Sham-Ho. Ngo was invited to join Labor and run the party's re-activated Canley Vale branch. This put him in direct competition with Newman, who ran the Canley Heights branch, despite previously agreeing not to challenge Newman for preselection. Political conflict According to the 1991 census, 70 percent of Cabramatta's population were immigrants. Around 25 percent were of Vietnamese descent while another 10 percent were of other Asian origins. Newman had been elected to the Fairfield council in 1977 and was known for his campaigns against Asian criminal gangs that were then a serious problem. At the time the media regularly portrayed Cabramatta as a \\"centre of criminality\\" and the heroin capital of Australia. Newman suspected Ngo took part in criminal dealings due to his involvement with the Mekong Club, which many believed to be laundering money for the Cabramatta gangs. According to his priest, Ngo had very strong opinions regarding Europeans, believing that they were all \\"stupid\\" and racist.Malcolm Brown Cold Blooded Murder Hachette Australia 2008 Pg 3 ‚Äì 36 In 1990, the local Fairfield Champion newspaper published an article regarding a proposal to add an inscription commemorating the Chinese Communist Revolution to the Pai Lau gate (Freedom Gate) in Cabramatta's Freedom Square. Ngo, then deputy mayor of Fairfield and an ardent anti-communist, blamed Newman for the proposal and sued the newspaper. The case was settled out of court. In 1991, Ngo stood as an independent for the seat of Cabramatta and Newman, who was the sitting member, issued a press release questioning Ngo's refugee status. Ngo received only 11.7% of the vote, a result he blamed on his being Asian. Following the election, Ngo joined Labor with the help of the Labor Right, led by Grace and his new Canley Vale branch, now directly competing with the Newman's (Labor Left) Canley Heights branch. Ngo and Newman vied for new members, which led to considerable infighting over branch stacking. The ALP general secretary, John Della Bosca, arranged a meeting to resolve the dispute, during which Ngo agreed not to challenge Newman for pre- selection in exchange for Newman not challenging the credentials of members who joined Ngo's branch. At this time Newman was being targeted: his car had been paint bombed three times and he was receiving death threats. Publicly he blamed the Vietnamese 5T gang, but privately he confided in acquaintances that he believed it was Ngo \\"and that gang of hooligans\\" at the Mekong Club. In 1994, Fairfield wanted a sister city. Ngo advocated a city from Taiwan, which was endorsed by councilors Lalich and Anwar Khoshaba; Newman, in line with official party policy, pushed for a city in China. A Taiwan relationship was against Australian Federal government policy, as Taiwan was not diplomatically recognised as a nation. According to former Cabramatta detective Tim Priest, Ngo had received a $117,000 cheque from Jin-Gou Chang of the Taipei Cultural Office in 1994. Newman learned of the transaction and accused Ngo, Lalich and Khoshaba of accepting funding from the Taiwanese government and stated that they should not be re-elected to the council, a position for which he received considerable support. The Hsinchu City sister city relationship was accepted despite only 100 Cabramatta citizens having Taiwanese ancestry. On 1 June, the Labor State Electoral Council condemned Ngo and Lalich, stating that if they continued to breach Labor policy regarding China, they would both be expelled.Tim Priest On Deadly Ground: The Assassination of John Newman MP New Holland Publishers 2010 Ngo was furious and began openly approaching people who were not criminals for advice on acquiring guns and hiring a hitman. Murder of John Newman Newman was murdered on 5 September 1994. Within days, the leader of the 5T gang, 21-year-old Tri Minh Tran, became the prime suspect. Ngo's conflict with Newman and his close ties to Tran led to widespread rumours in the community that he was involved which were repeated by the media. Tran, who had led the gang since the age of 14, was assassinated on 7 August 1995. On the afternoon of Tran's funeral, Cabramatta shopkeepers closed their businesses as a sign of respect, an honour they had also given to Newman. Ngo became the focus of police attention after one of Tran's relatives made a statement to police that he had rejected an offer of $10,000 from Ngo to kill Newman. The case against Ngo was weak and, after Ngo provided information to police that led to the arrest of the informant, the task force investigating the Newman murder was disbanded.Cabramatta Four Corners 8 April 1997 Trial Ngo was arrested for Newman's murder on 13 March 1998, and following two mistrials, was convicted by a jury on 29 June 2001. Aftermath In June 2003, evidence was found that Ngo was a member of the W2K (Willing To Kill) prison gang, leading to his transfer to the Goulburn Correctional Centre, a supermax prison. The High Court of Australia refused special leave to hear an appeal in May 2004. Two of Ngo's co-accused conspirators, David Dinh and Tu Quang Dao were acquitted by the same jury. A number of Ngo's supporters have stated that he was convicted on flimsy evidence. He was a prominent leader in the Vietnamese Catholic community, which held prayer services for him in the hope that he would be acquitted of the murder. However, almost 300 leaders in the Vietnamese community signed a petition to the Supreme Court requesting that Ngo be denied bail. In an enquiry after Newman's death, but prior to charges being laid, evidence was heard that Newman considered the Mekong Club to be a \\"gambling den\\". The prosecution in Ngo's case claimed that Newman were political rivals who competed for the same seat in Parliament. However, senior Labor figures, including Bosca, swore on oath that Ngo was not interested in Newman's seat but rather in a seat in the MLC.Geesche Jacobsen 2008, 'Meagher claims supported', The Sydney Morning Herald, 10 November, http://www.smh.com.au/news/national/meagher-claims- supported/2008/11/09/1226165386550.html In April 2005, China sponsored five Fairfield Council members to visit the country in order to improve the relationship that had deteriorated due to Ngo's support of Taiwan.The Orient express The Daily Telegraph 15 April 2005. HighBeam Research. Retrieved 27 June 2012 An inquiry was launched into Ngo's conviction on 6 June 2008, by order of Chief Justice James Spigelman of the New South Wales Supreme Court. The inquiry was overseen by former and Acting District Court judge, David Patten, and addressed several concerns raised as to the validity of the original conviction. On 17 April 2009, Patten ruled that the original conviction was sound. Following the inquiry, calls were made to have Ngo's name removed from monuments in Cabramatta. A former mayor and friend of Newman, Ken Chapman, claimed that this was unlikely to happen as Ngo had supporters on the council who had visited him in jail. Calls for the council to name a landmark in honour of Newman have not proceeded so far, although a swimming pool in Prairiewood bears his name.Political assassin Phuong Ngo honoured all over Fairfield Fairfield Advance 6 May 2009  References  Category:Australian people convicted of murder Category:Australian politicians convicted of crimes Category:Australian politicians of Vietnamese descent Category:Australian Roman Catholics Category:Vietnamese Roman Catholics Category:Living people Category:People from Sydney Category:Vietnamese emigrants to Australia Category:1958 births Category:People convicted of murder by New South Wales Category:Politicians convicted of murder Category:New South Wales local government politicians ","title":"Phuong Ngo"},{"id":"341331","text":"Doom II: Hell on Earth is a first-person shooter game by id Software. It was originally released for MS-DOS computers in 1994 and Macintosh computers in 1995. Unlike the original Doom, which was initially only available through shareware and mail order, Doom II was sold in stores. Master Levels for Doom II, an expansion pack with 21 new levels, was released on December 26, 1995. Doom II was ported to the Game Boy Advance in 2002, on Xbox Live Arcade in 2010, and on Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One in 2019. The release of the Doom source code has facilitated ports to many other platforms, including IOS and other cellphone systems. Gameplay The Super Shotgun in use Doom II was not dramatically different from its predecessor. There were no major technological developments, graphical improvements, or substantial gameplay changes. Instead, the development team took advantage of advances in computer hardware since the release of the original game that allowed them to do more with their game engine by making much larger and more intricate levels. The game still consists of the player navigating large nonlinear levels. Each level is infested with demons that can be killed with a variety of weapons that can be picked up throughout the game. Levels are completed by finding an exit, whether it be a switch or a teleporter; the goal is simply to advance to the next area. As with its predecessor, Doom II's levels can be completed in a straightforward fashion. However, because the levels are nonlinear players can wander off the beaten path, and those that do are often rewarded with bonuses, like health pickups and more powerful weapons. Due to the larger and more complicated maps with larger groups of monsters, the game had somewhat higher system requirements than the original. Rather than the player playing through three related episodes as in the first Doom, gameplay takes place over 32 levels, albeit with interludes for when the story develops. Instead of watching the player's progress on a map (as in the original episodes of Doom), the screens between each level simply show a background (a style carried over to the bonus fourth episode of Doom available in The Ultimate Doom, the retail re-release of the original Doom). This also means the player is never forced to lose all of their inventory after completing an episode. Doom II doubled the number of non-boss monster types and started using bosses from the original Doom as normal level enemies, in addition to adding a new weapon, the Super Shotgun (a very powerful double- barreled shotgun), and a new power-up, the Megasphere. =Multiplayer= Dooms multiplayer functionality was greatly improved in Doom II, including \\"out of the box\\" support for a vastly increased number of dial-up modems. The two- player dial-up connection allowed one player to dial into the other player's computer in order to play either cooperatively or in deathmatch-style combat. There was also Local area network (LAN) functionality added, which was improved upon as patches and updates were released. This functionality was later incorporated into the original Doom. As with the original Doom, multiplayer games used to be played using the dial-up or LAN by the internal setup program (setup.exe), through the online service DWANGO or with once- popular programs like Kali and Kahn (using SPX) in Windows 95. Nowadays, in the modern standards, Doom II can be played with almost any version of Windows across the internet using third-party source ports such as Odamex, Zandronum, ZDaemon, and are still popular today. The Xbox Live Arcade port of Doom II supports online multiplayer via Xbox Live. Plot The continuous 30 levels are divided into four areas; UAC Underground, UAC's Starport (Hellish Outpost), City, and Hell. Immediately following the events in Doom, the player once again assumes the role of Doomguy. After defeating the Spider Mastermind, the demons of hell open a portal to Earth for the marine, as he has \\"proven too tough for Hell to contain\\". After returning to Earth, the marine finds that it has also been invaded by the demons, who have killed billions of people. The humans who survived the attack have developed a plan to build massive spaceships which will carry the remaining survivors into space. Unfortunately, Earth's only ground spaceport has been taken over by the demons, who placed a flame barrier over it, preventing any ships from leaving. The marine battles hordes of demons and is able to deactivate the force field, allowing the remaining humans to escape. Once all the survivors have escaped Earth, the marine is the only human left on the planet. Just as he sits down to await death, knowing that he saved humanity, the marine then receives an off-planet transmission from the survivors in orbit, who have managed to find out where the armies of Hell are coming from. The message reveals that the demonic base is in the center of the marine's own hometown. He then fights through the city until he reaches the base, but sees there is no way to stop the invasion on that side. He decides to step into the portal to try deactivating it from the other side, entering Hell. After fighting through the hordes of Hell, the marine reaches the location of the biggest demon he has ever seen, called the Icon of Sin (Baphomet). He kills the Icon of Sin by firing rockets into its exposed brain. Its death causes devastation on Hell, and the portal to Earth is sealed. The marine wonders where evil people will go when they die now that Hell has been destroyed, and reflects that rebuilding the world will be more fun than saving it as he begins his journey back home. Development Most of the levels were designed by Sandy Petersen, with American McGee playing a significant role as well. The final level, Icon of Sin, contains an easter egg where two of the artists put the decapitated head of John Romero as the sprite hidden behind the icon on the wall which must be damaged by rocket splash damage three times to win the game. Romero, while playing the level to work on its sound effects, accidentally stumbled upon this in-joke of himself. After realising what his co-workers had done, Romero himself answered by recording his voice saying \\"To win the game, you must kill me, John Romero\\", putting it through various filters to distort it, then reverse the recording to create the \\"demonic chant\\" spoken by the head upon spotting the player. The photo that was scanned for the \\"John Romero's head\\"-sprite was from a Businessweek photo shot in 1994. Release An Atari Jaguar port was announced in early 1995 but it was never released. Likewise, a 3DO Interactive Multiplayer version was announced to be in development by Art Data Interactive, but it never materialized. Doom II was first released on October 10, 1994 (one of the days of the Doomsday rule and exactly ten months after the original), in both North America and Europe. Expansions =Master Levels for Doom II= Master Levels for Doom II is an official expansion pack for Doom II which was released on December 26, 1995 by id Software. The CD contains 20 WAD files created by various authors under contract. There was also an additional bonus called Maximum Doom consisting of 3,000 homebrew levels. =No Rest for the Living= No Rest for the Living is the title of an expansion pack developed by Nerve Software for the release of Doom II on Xbox Live Arcade for the Xbox 360. It consists of eight regular levels and one secret level. It is also included in the 2012 Doom II release from Doom 3: BFG Edition, as part of Doom Classic Complete for the PlayStation Network, and has been released as a free add-on for the 2019 Unity engine port of Doom II. Reception =Sales= According to David Kushner in Masters of Doom, id Software shipped 600,000 units of Doom II to stores in preparation for its launch. This initial shipment sold out within a month on shelves, despite its being expected to last for three months. Pre-orders for the game were so massive that it was difficult to buy from a store. The game products were displayed on pallets rather than shelves. The game was the United States' highest-selling computer title of 1994. It placed 10th for 1996, with 322,671 units sold and $12.6 million earned in the region that year alone. In the United States, Doom II was the third-best-selling computer game between 1993 and 1999, with 1.55 million units sold during that period. Its revenues in that country ultimately reached $80 million, while those in Europe reached $20 million. Of the latter figure, Kushner wrote that \\"30 percent [...] came from Germany‚Äîa country that had banned the game from its shelves.\\" =Critical reviews= The reception of Doom II was positive, with reviewers saying it refined everything that made the original Doom good. According to Dragon, \\"if mindless but intense carnage is what you want, you'll get your money's worth. It's not just a must-have game; it's a keep-on-the-hard-drive-forever game. If you need to have more Doom, get this.\\" Writer/game designer Chris Crawford used the level \\"Barrels O' Fun\\" to illustrate a point about death in video games, explaining he chose the level as his example because it is \\"one of the most complex and sophisticated challenges in one of the very best games of the 1990s\\". Next Generation reviewed the PC version of the game, rating it three stars out of five, and stated that \\"Now that the first person interface has become the design of choice for the entire industry, Id will need to find new innovations, or it will quickly find it's playing catch-up in its own game niche.\\" =Awards= Doom II won the Origins Award for Best Fantasy or Science Fiction Computer Game of 1994.

However, Abdallah's mother was a Persian slave concubine, and his pure Abbasid lineage gave Muhammad seniority over his half- brother. Indeed, he was the only Abbasid caliph to claim such descent. Already in 792, Harun had Muhammad receive the oath of allegiance (bay'ah) with the name of al-Amƒ´n (\\"The Trustworthy\\"), effectively marking him out as his main heir, while Abdallah was not named second heir, under the name al-Ma æm≈´n (\\"The Trusted One\\") until 799. Both brothers were assigned members of the powerful Barmakid family as tutors: al-Amin's tutor was al-Fadl ibn Yahya, while al- Ma'mun's was Ja'far ibn Yahya. Bukharan coinage, naming al-Amin as governor of Khurasan, These arrangements were confirmed and publicly proclaimed in 802, when Harun and the most powerful officials of the Abbasid government made the pilgrimage to Mecca. Al-Amin would succeed Harun in Baghdad, but al-Ma'mun would remain al-Amin's heir and would additionally rule over an enlarged Khurasan. This was an appointment of particular significance, as Khurasan had been the starting-point of the Abbasid Revolution which brought the Abbasids to power, and retained a privileged position among the Caliphate's provinces. Furthermore, the Abbasid dynasty relied heavily on Khurasanis as military leaders and administrators. Many of the original Khurasani Arab army (Khurasaniyya) that came west with the Abbasids were given estates in Iraq and the new Abbasid capital, Baghdad, and became an elite group known as the abnƒÅ æ al-dawla (\\"sons of the state/dynasty\\"). This large-scale presence of an Iranian element in the highest circles of the Abbasid state, with the Barmakid family as its most notable representatives, was certainly a factor in the appointment of al-Ma'mun, linked through his mother with the eastern Iranian provinces, as heir and governor of Khurasan. The stipulations of the agreement, which were recorded in detail by the historian al-Tabari, accorded al-Mamun's Khurasani viceroyalty extensive autonomy. However, modern historians consider that these accounts may have been distorted by later apologists of al-Ma'mun in the latter's favour. Harun's third heir, al- Mu'tamin, received responsibility over the frontier areas with the Byzantine Empire in Upper Mesopotamia and Syria. These complex arrangements, sealed with mutual judicial and religious oaths, clearly demonstrate that Harun was conscious of their precariousness, in view of the profound differences between al-Amin and al-Ma'mun, both in character and in interests. Very quickly, this latent rivalry had important repercussions: almost immediately after the court returned to Baghdad in January 803, the Abbasid elites were shaken by the abrupt fall of the Barmakid family from power. On the one hand, this event may reflect the fact that the Barmakids had become indeed too powerful for the Caliph's liking, but its timing suggests that it was tied to the succession issue as well: with al-Amin siding with the abnƒÅ æ and al-Ma'mun with the Barmakids, and the two camps becoming more estranged every day, if al-Amin was to have a chance to succeed, the power of the Barmakids had to be broken. Indeed, the years after the fall of the Barmakids saw an increasing centralization of the administration and the concomitant rise of the influence of the abnƒÅ æ, many of whom were now dispatched to take up positions as provincial governors and bring these provinces under closer control from Baghdad. This led to unrest in the provinces, especially Khurasan, where local elites had a long-standing rivalry with the abnƒÅ æ and their tendency to control of the province (and its revenues) from Iraq. The harsh taxation imposed by a prominent member of the abnƒÅ æ, Ali ibn Isa ibn Mahan, even led to a revolt under Rafi ibn al-Layth, which eventually forced Harun himself, accompanied by al-Ma'mun and the powerful chamberlain (hajib) and chief minister al-Fadl ibn al-Rabi, to travel to the province in 808. Al-Ma'mun was sent ahead with part of the army to Marv, while Harun stayed at Tus, where he died on 24 March 809. Caliphate =Hostility towards al-Mamun= Al-Ma'mun had distrusted al-Amin before their father's death and convinced Harun to take him with him on Harun's last journey east. Although Harun had instructed the Baghdad commanders of this expedition to remain with al-Ma'mun, after Harun's death they returned to Baghdad. Al-Amin sought to turn al-Ma'mun's financial agent in Rayy against al-Ma'mun and he ordered al-Ma'mun to acknowledge al- Amin's son Musa as heir and return to Baghdad. Al-Ma'mun replaced his agent in Rayy and refused the orders. His mother was Persian and he had strong support in Iran. The brothers had different mothers. Al-Amin was prompted to move against al-Ma'mun by meddlesome ministers, especially al-Fadl ibn al-Rabi'. He had Harun's succession documents brought from Mecca to Baghdad, where he destroyed them. Then, he sent agents east to stir opposition to al-Ma'mun. However, a careful watch at the frontier denied them the opportunity. Al-Amin denied al-Ma'mun's request for his family and money and kept them in Baghdad. In March 811 Al-Amin dispatched an army under Ali ibn Isa ibn Mahan against Al-Ma'mun. Ali advanced on Rayy. Ma'mun's capable general Tahir bin Husain met and defeated Ali, who was killed. =Internal rebellions= Al-Amin faced unrest in Syria. He sent Abd al-Malik ibn Salih to restore order there. There was fierce fighting and Abd al-Malik died. Al-Amin sent Ahmad ibn Mazyad and Abdallah ibn Humayd east, each with an army (al-Tabari v. 31 p. 100 says each had 20,000 men). However, Tahir's agents sowed discord and these two armies fought against each other. Al-Amin faced an uprising in Baghdad led by Ali ibn Isa's son Husayn. This was quelled and Husayn was killed. Tahir took Ahwaz and gained control of Bahrayn and parts of Arabia. Basra and Kufa swore allegiance to al-Ma'mun. Tahir advanced on Baghdad and defeated a force sent against him. In Mecca, Dawud ibn Isa reminded worshippers that al-Amin had destroyed Harun ar Rashid's succession pledges and led them in swearing allegiance to al- Mamun. Dawud then went to Marv and presented himself to al-Ma'mun. Al-Ma'mun confirmed Dawud in his governorship of Mecca and Medina. =Personal relationships, death and succession= Wives Al-Amin is recorded as having two wives, Arib bint al-Ma'muniyyah, and LubƒÅna bint ‚ÄòAlƒ´ ibn al-Mahdƒ´ (who was noted for her exceptional beauty).Classical Poems by Arab Women: A Bilingual Anthology, ed. and trans. by Abdullah al-Udhari (London: Saqi Books, 1999), p. 120; . However, Al-Amin died before the consummation of his marriage to Lubanah; her attested poetry includes a lament for his death: 'Oh hero lying dead in the open, betrayed by his commanders and guards. I cry over you not for the loss of my comfort and companionship, but for your spear, your horse and your dreams. I cry over my lord who widowed me before our wedding night'. Death In 812, Tahir advanced and set up camp near Baghdad's Anbar Gate and besieged the city. The effects of this siege were made more intense by the rampaging prisoners who broke out of jail. There were several vicious battles, such as at al-Amin's palace of Qasr Halih, at Darb al- Hijarah and the al-Shammasiyyah Gate. In that last one Tahir led reinforcements to regain positions lost by another officer. Overall the situation was worsening for al-Amin and he became depressed. When Tahir pushed into the city, al-Amin sought to negotiate safe passage out. Tahir reluctantly agreed on the condition al-Amin turn over his sceptre, seal and other symbols of office. Al-Amin tried to leave on a boat, apparently with these symbols, rejecting warnings to wait. However, Tahir noticed the boat, and Al-Amin was thrown into the water, swam to shore, was captured and then brought to a room, where he was executed. His head was placed on the Anbar Gate. Al-Tabari (v. 31 pp. 197‚Äì202) quotes Tahir's letter to al-Ma'mun informing him of al-Amin's capture and execution and the state of peace resulting in Baghdad. Al-Amin had appealed to his mother to arbitrate the succession after his death and champion his cause and lineage as Aisha had done two centuries before. Zubaida, however, refused to do so. As al-Ma'mun refused to acknowledge Al- Amin's son Musa as heir, the throne went to al-Ma'mun.

The √âcole des beaux-arts is made up of a complex of buildings located at 14 rue Bonaparte, between the quai Malaquais and the rue Bonaparte. This is in the heart of Saint-Germain- des-Pr√©s, just across the Seine from the Louvre museum. The school was founded in 1648 by Charles Le Brun as the famed French academy Acad√©mie de peinture et de sculpture. In 1793, at the height of the French Revolution, the institutes were suppressed. However, in 1817, following the Bourbon Restoration, it was revived under a changed name after merging with the Acad√©mie d'architecture. Held under the King's tutelage until 1863, an imperial decree on November 13, 1863 named the school's director, who serves for a five-year term. Long supervised by the Ministry of Public Instruction, the √âcole des Beaux-Arts is now a public establishment under the Ministry of Culture. History The √âcole nationale sup√©rieure des beaux-arts in Paris is the original of a series of √âcoles des beaux-arts in French regional centers. Since its founding in 1648, the Acad√©mie royale de peinture et de sculpture has had a school, France's elite institution of instruction in the arts. Its program was structured around a series of anonymous competitions that culminated in the grand prix de l'Acad√©mie Royale, more familiar as the Grand Prix de Rome, for its winner was awarded a bourse and a place at the French Academy in Rome. During his stay in Rome, a pensionnaire was expected to send regular envois of his developing work back to Paris. Contestants for the Prix were assigned a theme from the literature of Classical Antiquity; their individual identities were kept secret to avoid any scandal of favoritism. Rinaldo and Armida, Fran√ßois Boucher's morceau de r√©ception, gained his admission to the Acad√©mie royale in 1734. With his final admission into the Acad√©mie, the new member had to present his fellow academicians a morceau de r√©ception, a painting or sculpture that demonstrated his learning, intelligence, and proficiency in his art. Jacques-Louis David's Andromache Mourning Hector was his reception offering in 1783; today it is in the collections of the Louvre Museum. In 1793, during the French Revolution, the Acad√©mie Royale and the grand prix de l'Acad√©mie Royale were abolished, but only a few years later, in 1797, the Prix de Rome was re-established. Each year throughout the nineteenth century, the winner of the Prix de Rome was granted five years of study at the Villa Medici, after which the painter or sculptor could fully expect to embark on a successful official career. The program resulted in the accumulation of some great collections at the Acad√©mie, one of the finest collections of French drawings, many of them sent as envoies from Rome, as well as the paintings and sculptures, usually the winners, of the competitions, or salons. Lesser competitions, known as the petits concours, took themes like history composition (which resulted in many sketches illustrating instructive moments from antiquity), expressions of the emotions, and full and half-figure painting. In its role as a teaching institution, the √âcole assembled a large collection of Italian and French etchings and engravings, dating from the 16th through the 18th century. Such prints published the composition of paintings to a wide audience. The print collection was first made available to students outside the Acad√©mie in 1864. Today, studies include: painting, installation, graphic arts, photography, sculpture, digital media and video. ENSBA provides the highest level of training in contemporary art production. Throughout history, many world-renowned artists have either taught or studied at this institution. The faculty is made up of recognized international artists. Theoretical courses permitting diverse approaches to the history of the arts complement studio work, which is supported by technical training and access to technical bases. The ENSBA media center provides students with rich documentation on art, and organizes conferences, seminars, and debates throughout the year. The School buildings have architectural interest and house prestigious historical collections and an extensive fine arts library. The school publishes a dozen texts per year on different collections, and holds exhibitions ranging from the school's excellent collection of old-master drawings to the most up to date contemporary works, in the Quai Malaquais space and the Chapel throughout the year. Collections The school owns circa 450,000 items divided between artworks and historical books, making it one of the largest public art collections in France. The collection encompasses many types of artistic productions, from painting and sculpture to etching, furniture or decorated books and from all the periods of art history. Many pieces of the collection are artworks created by students of the School throughout its history but former students and scholars also contributed to enlarge the holdings with many gifts and donations to the institution. The collection consists in approximatively 2,000 paintings (including pictures by Nicolas Poussin, Anthony van Dyck, Hyacinthe Rigaud, Jean-Honor√© Fragonard, Hubert Robert and Ingres), 600 pieces of decorative arts, 600 architectural elements, nearly 15,000 medals, 3,700 sculptures, 20,000 drawings including works by Paolo Veronese, Primaticcio, Jacques Bellange, Michelangelo, Charles Le Brun, Nicolas Poussin, Claude Gell√©e, D√ºrer, Rembrandt, Ingres, Fran√ßois Boucher or Pierre Alechinsky, 45,000 architectural drawings, 100,000 etchings and engravings, 70,000 photographs (mainly form the period 1850-1914), 65,000 books dating from the 15th to the 20th century (3,500 for the 15th and 16th centuries), and 1,000 handwritten pieces of archive (letters, inventories, notes...) and also 390 important fragments or complete illuminated manuscripts. Palais des Beaux-Arts Entrance at 14 Rue Bonaparte The physical setting of the school stands on about two hectares in the Saint- Germain-des-Pr√©s section of Paris. The main entrance at 14 Rue Bonaparte is flanked by colossal carved heads of Pierre Paul Puget and Nicolas Poussin (done in 1838 by Michel-Louis Victor Mercier). Before 1816, Beaux-Arts students were taught elsewhere. This land had been the convent of the Petits Augustins, then the site of Alexandre Lenoir's collection of architectural fragments from across France, the Mus√©e national des Monuments Fran√ßais, assembled here as a result of the destruction of churches and noble chateaux during the revolution. In 1830, architect F√©lix Duban, a former student and winner of the Grand Prix de Rome, began a transformation of the site by demolishing a few existing houses, moving back the convent's cloister on the right to produce a symmetrical courtyard, and designing the largest central building, the Palais des √âtudes. Duban simply incorporated many of Lenoir's historical fragments, notably the portal of the 1548 Ch√¢teau d'Anet, and in the courtyard a facade from the Ch√¢teau de Gaillon, since removed and returned to its original site in 1977. The H√©micycle mural by Paul Delaroche In other ways Duban meant the entire complex as an open-air encyclopedia for artists and architects. The Palais des √âtudes building features elaborate frescoes, the stairwells demonstrate various wall finishes, and the courtyard (glassed over by Duban in 1863) once held classical statuary and full-size copies of the columns of the Parthenon for study. The core of the complex is a semi- circular award theater within the Palais, the H√©micycle d'Honneur, where the prizes were awarded. Duban commissioned Paul Delaroche to produce a great mural, 27 metres long, to represent seventy-five great artists of all ages, in conversation, assembled in groups. In the middle are three thrones occupied by the creators of the Parthenon: sculptor Phidias, architect Ictinus, and painter Apelles, symbolizing the unity of these arts. The mural took Delaroche three and a half years to complete, and it still stands as a powerful expression of the Beaux-Arts collaborative ideal. In this replica painting by Charles B√©ranger, the auditorium of √âcole des beaux-arts is depicted. Walters Art Museum, Baltimore. Duban continued to expand and improve the complex for decades. Other major buildings include the 1820 B√¢timent des Loges, the modified cloister now called the Cour des M√ªriers, the 1862 B√¢timent des Expositions which extended the campus to the Quai Malaquias, the H√¥tel de Chimay built circa 1750 and acquired by the school in 1884, and a block of studios constructed circa 1945 in concrete by Auguste Perret.

and Ringinglow--is one of the 28 electoral wards in City of Sheffield, England. It is located in the southwestern part of the city and covers an area of . The population of this ward in 2007 was 19,211 people in 7,626 households, reducing to 6,657 at the 2011 Census. Ecclesall ward is one of the four wards that make up the South West Community Assembly and one of five wards that make up the Sheffield Hallam Parliamentary constituency. The Member of Parliament is Olivia Blake, a Labour MP. Ecclesall is one of the least socially deprived wards in the entire country, with a 2002 deprivation score of 4.7--making it the 8,105th most deprived (hence 309th least deprived) ward out of 8,414 wards in the country. The demographic consists largely of white, middle-class families. History Evidence of early occupation of the area can be found in Ecclesall Woods. A cup and ring-marked stone was discovered in 1981, and has been dated to the late Neolithic or Bronze Age periods. It, and the area a diameter around it, is a scheduled ancient monument. Ecclesall electoral ward was created 1934 when the old Ecclesall Bierlow ward was divided into Ecclesall, Broomhill and Hallam. The boundaries of the ward include about half of the area that was historically known as Ecclesall Bierlow--one of the six 'townships' that made up the old Parish of Sheffield. Ecclesall Bierlow encompassed most of the land between the River Sheaf and the Porter Brook from The Moor to Ringinglow. It also included the areas of Broomhall and Crookesmoor to the north of Porter Brook. Though this area contained numerous small villages and hamlets, there was never a village called Ecclesall. In ancient times this area was part of the Barnsdale Forest that, together with Sherwood Forest, made up the forest of the Robin Hood legends. The River Sheaf marked the boundary between the Anglo-Saxon kingdoms of Mercia and Deira (later Northumbria). In fact the earliest historical record of this area refers to the submission of the Northumbrian army to Egbert of Wessex at nearby Dore in 829. Ecclesall Corn Mill at Millhouses. The name Ecclesall (either from Heeksel-Hallr meaning the witches' hill, (wikisource) or Eccles (church) halh (hollow)) is not mentioned in the Domesday Book of 1086--at that time Ecclesall was a part of the manor of Hallam. The name is first found about 150 years later in the name of Sir Ralphus De Ecclesall a knight of the realm who had settled in the area. The De Ecclesall family gave land to the monks at Beauchief and established a corn mill on the river Sheaf, which they subsequently also gave to Beauchief Abbey. Many of the buildings of Ecclesall corn mill can still be seen at the northern end of Millhouses park--the district of Millhouses taking its name from this mill. In payment for the mill the monks of Beauchief were to provide a canon to say prayers daily at the Ecclesall chapel. These services continued at the chapel until the Dissolution of the Monasteries when Beauchief Abbey was abandoned. The chapel was restored in 1622 but was demolished when the present church was built nearby in 1788. Until the 19th century Ecclesall Bierlow was very sparsely populated--in 1801 there were just 5362 people. This changed with the coming of the industrial revolution and the subsequent expansion of nearby Sheffield and by 1831 the population had increased to 14,239. In 1837 the Ecclesall Bierlow Poor Law Union came into being. As well as Ecclesall Bierlow, this encompassed Nether Hallam, Upper Hallam, Beauchief, Dore, Norton, and Totley. A workhouse was built on Cherry Tree Hill at Nether Edge. In 1929 the Ecclesall Bierlow Workhouse was renamed Nether Edge Hospital and it remained in use as a hospital into the 1990s. Historic sites within the ward include Abbeydale Industrial Hamlet and Shepherd Wheel (both now museums). Ecclesall Wood has many examples of white coal kilns and the grave of a wood collier who was killed here when his cabin burned down on 11 October 1786. Neighbourhoods =Ecclesall= The district of Ecclesall () is centred roughly on Ecclesall parish church at the intersection of Carter Knowle Road and Ecclesall Road. The present church, dedicated to All Saints, was built in 1788, consecrated in 1789 and has been altered several times since. Banner Cross Hall, also in the area, was built in 1820. =Greystones= Greystones () lies to the north of the district of Ecclesall. It is on a headland overlooking the Porter valley to the north and west. =Millhouses= Millhouses () lies to the south of the district of Ecclesall. Its origins lie in a small hamlet that grew around the Ecclesall Corn Mill. =Bents Green= Bents Green () lies to the west of the district of Ecclesall =Ringinglow= Ringinglow () is a village on the western border of Ecclesall Ward. Although it is within the boundary of the City of Sheffield, it is self- contained, entirely surrounded by open countryside. It is focussed on the intersections of Fulwood Lane and Houndkirk Road with Ringinglow Road. Transport Ecclesall Road is the main road (A625) from central Sheffield to the south-west, at first following the Porter Brook, then running through Ecclesall and Dore. The road is a major shopping area. Attractions including the Sheffield Botanical Gardens and the Sheffield General Cemetery lie alongside it, as does one of the campuses of Sheffield Hallam University. Abbeydale Road South (A621) is another major road that runs through the ward. The Midland Main Line railway line runs along the southern boundary of the ward, though the closest stations are outside of the ward at Sheffield and Dore & Totley, the former Millhouses & Ecclesall station was closed on 10 June 1968. The Sheffield Supertram currently has no routes through Ecclesall ward, but a planned extension to Dore would skirt the southern boundary. Parks and recreation About half of Ecclesall ward is made up of rural areas, parkland, or woodland. These areas include a large portion of the Ecclesall Woods, an area of ancient woodland that is known locally for being a bluebell wood. In the north section of the ward is Bingham Park, Whiteley Woods and part of the Porter valley; Millhouses Park marks the ward's southern boundary. The ward also includes some of Whirlow Brook Park and the Limb valley. The Sheffield Round Walk skirts the ward, running through a number of these parks. Education There are two secondary schools within Ecclesall ward, High Storrs School and Silverdale School. The ward also includes Ecclesall Infants and Junior Schools, Dobcroft Junior School, Greystones Primary School, Mylnhurst Convent School, and St Wilfrid's Primary School.

He was a Member of the European Parliament (MEP) from 1979 to 1984 and Member of Parliament (MP) for Wantage from 1983 to 2005, having been elected as a Conservative; however, he joined the Labour Party in 2005. Early life He was raised in Nkana, Northern Rhodesia (now Zambia) where his father worked on the copper mines and was educated at Falcon College in Rhodesia and St Edmund Hall, Oxford, where he rose to the presidency of the Oxford Union. He was then elected to a fellowship of All Souls College, Oxford, one of the UK's most prestigious academic distinctions. Jackson is married to Caroline Jackson, a former Member of the European Parliament. He had worked as a political advisor to senior ministers prior to being elected and also as political advisor to the Governor of Rhodesia, Lord Soames, during its transition to independence as Zimbabwe. He edited the Round Table Journal from 1970 to 1974. Parliamentary career In the October 1974 general election, Jackson stood in Manchester Central without success. In European Parliament election in 1979 he was elected as a Member of the European Parliament (MEP) for Upper Thames. He played a prominent role on the European Parliament's budget committee. At the 1983 general election, he was elected to the House of Commons as MP for Wantage. He was subsequently appointed as a junior minister at the Department of Education and Science (1987‚Äì90), the Department of Employment (1990‚Äì92) and the Office of Public Service and Science (1992‚Äì93).

Lesser Antillean music is part of the broader category of Caribbean music; much of the folk and popular music is also a part of the Afro-American musical complex, being a mixture of African, European and indigenous American elements. The Lesser Antilles' musical cultures are largely based on the music of African slaves brought by European traders and colonizers. The African musical elements are a hybrid of instruments and styles from numerous West African tribes, while the European slaveholders added their own musics into the mix, as did immigrants from India. In many ways, the Lesser Antilles can be musically divided based on which nation colonized them. The former British colonies include Trinidad and Tobago, whose calypso style is an especially potent part of the music of the other former British colonies, which also share traditions like the Big Drum dance. The French islands of Martinique and Guadeloupe share the popular zouk style and have also had extensive musical contact with the music of Haiti, itself once a French colony though not part of the Lesser Antilles. The Dutch colonies of Cura√ßao, Bonaire and Aruba share the combined rhythm popular style. The islands also share a passion for kaseko, a genre of Surinamese music; Suriname and its neighbors Guyana and French Guiana share folk and popular styles that are connected enough to the Antilles and other Caribbean islands that both countries are studied in the broader context of Antillean or Caribbean music. Characteristics While Lesser Antillean music is very often discussed as a music area, this division is of limited usefulness. The islands of the Lesser Antilles divide musically along linguistic lines, with the most significant overlap coming from Dominica and Saint Lucia, both primarily Anglophone but strongly influenced by a French colonial past. Because the islands are divided linguistically, the term Antillean music is usually used in reference to one such music area. Thus, for example, the Rough Guide to World Music features a chapter on \\"Antillean music\\", which is entirely about the French Antillean islands of Martinique and Guadeloupe, with a brief sidebar specifically about the Dutch Antilles. In the context of Anglophone music, the term Antillean music most commonly refers to Trinidad and Tobago, home to the well-known calypso style. Music author Peter Manuel, for example, treats all the Anglophone islands as a subject of Trinidadian calypso traditions, while using the title Music of the Lesser Antilles for Francophone Antillean music. Manuel also, like many authors, treats Suriname and Guyana as integral aspects of Caribbean music; due to the Dutch colonial history of both countries, they are often grouped with Aruba and the Netherlands Antilles.De Ledesma and Scaramuzzo, p. 289‚Äì303.Manuel, Caribbean Currents, p. 140‚Äì145, 183‚Äì208. Nevertheless, Antillean music can be characterized by the prominence of the Carnival celebration (prominently from Trinidad and Tobago), and the importance of calypso-like song traditions. The Lesser Antilles is also home to a strong Indo-Caribbean population; though Indo-Caribbean music is found elsewhere in the Caribbean, the prominence of Indian-influenced styles is a hallmark of the Antillean music scenes. Regional forms can also be found outside of the Caribbean entirely, most notably in New York City, where Brooklyn's Labor Day Carnival features music and parades, mas and steel bands; this Carnival is distinct to New York, and reflects elements of a pan-Caribbean nature.Manuel, Caribbean Currents, p. 210. =Calypso and calypso-like traditions= Calypso is most closely associated with the island of Trinidad, but it has spread throughout the Lesser Antilles, and abroad. Similar traditions can be found natively on many of Caribbean islands. Within the Antilles, most of the popular calypso stars have come from Trinidad and Tobago; the majority of the exceptions, such as Arrow from Montserrat, have come from other Anglophone islands. Music author Peter Manuel has argued that, despite the modern Anglophone focus to calypso-like song forms, their origins lie in the \\"Afro-French creole culture\\", and notes that the ancestor of the word calypso, cariso, was first used to refer to a Martinican singer.Manuel, Caribbean Currents, p. 208. The calypso song complex is characterized by satirical, political, risque and humorous lyricism, a competitive and celebratory nature and its function in social organization and informal communication. Jamaican mento is perhaps the best-known form of calypso-like music. The island of Carriacou is home to a calypso-like song style, as well as canboulay feasts, calinda songs, and steel bands, all similar to the related Trinidadian traditions, though distinct from them. Modern influences from Trinidad have organized the Carriacou song style, and there are competitions similar to calypso tents on the island.Manuel, p. 209‚Äì210; Manuel specifically cites much of the material on Carriacou to Donald Hill, Calypso Calaloo: Early Carnival Music in Trinidad (Gainesville: University Press of Florida, 1993) The Antiguan benna is part of the same song complex, featuring news-oriented and ribald, often satirical lyrics and a rhythmic, uptempo style. =Carnival= A Carnival troupe in the Virgin Islands Annual Carnival celebrations are an important part of the culture of all the Lesser Antillean islands. Carnival is celebrated at varying times of year, either pre-Lent, Christmastime or in July and August, and feature a wide variety of dances, songs and parades. Contests are common, especially Calypso King and Queen contests, which are held on most of the British Antillean islands, the U.S. Virgin Islands as well as French Saint Martin and elsewhere. The British Antillean Carnivals are also mostly united by the J'ouvert tradition, which involves calypso and soca band parades and are the highlight of their celebrations. Summer Carnivals include those on Antigua, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, Sint Eustatius, Saint John, Saint Lucia, Grenada, Saba, Nevis and Anguilla, the latter two of which are especially known for popular calypso competitions. Christmastime Carnivals are held on Montserrat, Saint Croix, Saint Martin and Saint Kitts; Montserrat's distinctive Carnival includes masquerades and steelbands, and both islands also feature calypso competitions. The Carnival of Sint Maarten, which takes place a month after Easter, is known for the burning of King Moui-Moui as the culmination of the festival. Many islands, especially the French and Dutch Antilles, are home to pre-Lenten Carnivals, including Martinique, Aruba, Saint-Barth√©lemy, Bonaire, Cura√ßao, Dominica, Saint Thomas and Guadeloupe.Cameron, p. 480, 502, 525, 536, 573, 593. British Antilles There are many popular traditions common to the English-speaking islands of the Lesser Antilles. Calypso, originally an old folk music‚Äìbased genre from West Africa, is popular throughout the islands; other popular traditions, like soca originally from Trinidad, are also well known throughout the region. Steel drum ensembles is also found throughout the English-speaking Lesser Antilles (and abroad), especially in Trinidad and Tobago as well as Antigua and Barbuda. The British Antilles also share in certain folk traditions. Eastern Caribbean folk calypso is found throughout the area, as are African-Caribbean religious music styles like the Shango music of Trinidad.Manuel, Caribbean Currents, p. 183‚Äì211. Variants of the Big Drum festival occur throughout the Windward Islands, especially in Saint Vincent and the Grenadines. Carnival is an important folk music celebration on all the islands of the Lesser Antilles, and the rest of the Caribbean. Calypso is part of a spectrum of similar folk and popular Caribbean styles that spans benna and mento, but remains the most prominent genre of Lesser Antillean music. Calypso's roots are somewhat unclear, but we know it can be traced to 18th-century Trinidad and other Caribbean islands like Saint Lucia. Modern calypso, however, began in the 19th century, a fusion of disparate elements ranging from the masquerade song lavway, French Creole belair and the stick fighting chantwell. Calypso's early rise was closely connected with the adoption of Carnival by Trinidadian slaves, including camboulay drumming and the music masquerade processions. Popular calypso arose in the early 20th century, with the rise of internationally known calypsonians like Attila the HunQuevedo, Raymond (Atilla the Hun). 1983. Atilla's Kaiso: a short history of Trinidad calypso. University of the West Indies, St. Augustine, Trinidad. (Includes the words to many old calypsos as well as musical scores for some of Atilla's calypsos.) and Roaring Lion. calypso remained popular throughout the Caribbean in the later 20th century, the islands began producing calypso stars. In the 1970s, a calypso variant called soca arose, characterized by a focus on dance rhythms rather than lyricism. Soca has since spread across the Caribbean and abroad. The Mongoose Play, a popular Kittitian production of folk theatre and music Steel drums are a distinctively Trinidadian ensemble that evolved from improvised percussion instruments used in Carnival processions. By the late 1930s, bamboo tubes, a traditional instrumental, were supplemented by pieces of metal used percussively; over time, these metal percussion instruments were pitched to produce as many as twenty-some tones. Steel bands were large orchestras of these drums, and were banned by the British colonial authorities. Nevertheless, steel drums spread across the Caribbean, and are now an entrenched part of the culture of Trinidad and Tobago. Though Trinidadian popular music is by far the most well-known style of Lesser Antillean music, the other Anglophone islands are home to their own musical traditions. Carriacou and Grenada are home to Carnival celebrations that feature distinct form of calypso, canboulay feasts, calinda stick- fighting songs and the steelband accompanied jouvert, as well as the Big Drum dance, which is also found in Saint Vincent and the Grenadines. Grenada and Saint Vincent and the Grenadines share other musics as well including the funereal music of the saraca rite, a call-and-response form with both European and African lyrics. French Antilles French Antillean Carnival in Paris French Creole music is most famously associated with Martinique and Guadeloupe, though the islands of Saint Lucia and Dominica are also home to French Antillean music. Creole music is characterized by the prominence of the quadrille dance, distinct from the French version and related to the Haitian mereng. The quadrille is a potent symbol of French Antillean culture.Manuel, Caribbean Currents, p. 140‚Äì141. Martinique and Guadeloupe are also home to their own distinct folk traditions, most influentially including Guadeloupan gwo ka and Martinican tambour and tibwa. Gwo ka is a type of percussion music which consists of seven basic rhythms and variations on them. It has been modernized into gwo ka moderne, though traditional rural performances (lewoz) are still common. Tambour and ti bwa ensembles are the origin of several important Martinican popular styles, including chouval bwa and biguine, and also exerted an influence on zouk. Lucian folk music features ensembles of fiddle, cuatro, banjo, guitar and chak-chak (a rattle), with the banjo and cuatro being of iconic importance, and recreational, often lyric song forms called jw√©. The French Creole folk music of Dominica is based on the quadrille, accompanied by ensembles called jing ping. Folk storytelling (kont) and songs (b√©l√©) are also a major part of the country's musical identity. =Kadans/Compas= In the 1970s, a wave of Haitian, mostly musicians, to Dominica and the French Antilles (Guadeloupe and Martinique) brought with them the kadans, a sophisticated form of music that quickly swept the island and helped unite all the former French colonies of the Caribbean by combining their cultural influences. These Haitians drew upon previous success from mini-jazz artists like Les Gentlemen, Les Leopards, and Les Vikings de Guadeloupe. Later in the decade and into the 1980s, the French Antilles became home to a style of cadence music called cadence-lypso. Gordon Henderson's Exile One innovated this style, as well as turned the mini-jazz combos into guitar-dominated big bands with full-horn sections and keyboard synthesizers, paving the way for the success of large groups like Grammacks, Experience 7, among others. Drawing on these influences, the supergroup Kassav' invented zouk and popularized it with hit songs like \\"Zouk-La-Se Sel Medikaman Nou Ni\\". Kassav' formed from Paris in 1978. =Cadence-lypso= Cadence-lypso is the Dominican kadans of the 1970s. The leading figure in the promotion of the Cadence-lypso was the Dominican group Exile One (based on the island of Guadeloupe) and Grammacks that featured the Haitian Cadence rampa or compas with the Trinidadian calypso, hence the name cadence-lypso; however, most of the bands repertoire was kadans This fusion of kadans and calypso accounts only for a small percentage of the band's repertoire: Exile One like all Dominica kadans bands featured reggae, calypso and mostly kadans or compas music.Grammacks: mediba (kadans), banana (sweet kadans), ou pa bon, (kadans), ou pitit (kadans), reggae down, disco live (kadans) this same tune is categorized as zouk retro by Deejay Zak (midlay kadans 11/24/2011) Exile one: akiyaka, gade deye...(Midnight) get ready 1997, etc. The Dominican kadans has evolved under the influence of Dominican and Caribbean/Latin rhythms, as well as rock guitars, soul-style vocals and funk bass and horn styles - music from the United States. By the end of the 1970s, Gordon Henderson defined Cadence- lypso as \\"a synthesis of Caribbean and African musical patterns fusing the traditional with the contemporary\\". It was pushed in the 1970s by groups from Dominica, and was the first style of Dominican music to find international acclaim. Exile One, based in Guadeloupe, is a leading Dominican kadans group of the 1970s that was very influential in the development of caribbean music. The full-horn section kadans band Exile One led by Gordon Henderson was the first to introduce the newly arrived synthesizers to their music that other young cadence or compas bands from Dominica, Haiti (mini-jazz) and the French Antilles emulated in the 1970s. Exile One was the most promoted creole band of the Caribbean. The first to sign a production contract with major label Barclay Records. The first to export kadans music to the four corners of the globe: Japan, the Indian Ocean, Africa, North America, Europe, The Cape Verde islands. =Zouk= The inspiration for Zouk's style of rhythmic music comes from the Haitian compas, as well as music called cadence-lypso - Dominica cadence popularized by Grammacks and Exile One. Elements of gwo ka, tambour, ti bwa and biguine vid√© are prominent in zouk. Though there are many diverse styles of zouk, some commonalities exist. The French Creole tongue of Martinique and Guadeloupe is an important element, and are a distinctive part of the music. Generally, zouk emphasises star singers, with little attention given to instrumentalists, and performances consist almost entirely of studio recordings. Ethnomusicologist Jocelyn Guilbault believes zouk's evolution was influenced by other Caribbean styles especially Dominica cadence-lypso, Haitian cadence and Guadeloupean biguine. Zouk arose in the late 1970s and early 1980s, using elements of previous styles of antillean music, as well as importing other genres. The band Kassav' remain the best known zouk group. Kassav' drew in influences from balakadri and bal granmoun dances, biguine's and mazurka's, along with more contemporary Caribbean influences like compas, reggae and salsa music. Zouk live shows soon began to draw on American and European rock and heavy metal traditions, and the genre spread across the world, primarily in developing countries. Zouk has diversified into multiple subgenres. These include zouk-love, pop ballads by artists like Edith Lefel and Gilles Floro, Zouk-R&B;, and ragga-zouk bands like Lord Kossity who fused the genre with other influences. =Zouk-love= Zouk Love is the French Antilles cadence or compas, characterized by a slow, soft and sexual rhythm. The lyrics of the songs often speak of love and sentimental problems. The music kizomba from Angola and cabo-love from Cape Verde are also derivatives of this French Antillean compas music style, which sounds basically the same, although there are notable differences once you become more familiar with these genres. A main exponent of this subgenre is Ophelia Marie. Other Zouk Love artists come from the French West Indies, the Netherlands, and Africa. Popular artists include French West Indian artists Edith Lefel and Nichols, or like Netherlands based Suzanna Lubrano and Gil Semedo, the African artist Kaysha. =Bouyon= Bouyon (Boo-Yon) is a form of popular music of Dominica, also known as jump up music in Guadeloupe and Martinique. The best-known band in the genre is Windward Caribbean Kulture (WCK), who originated the style in 1988 by experimenting elements of kadans (or cadence-lypso), lapo kabwit drumming, the folk style jing-ping, and a quick-paced electronic drum pattern. From a language perspective, Bouyon draws on English and Dominican Creole French. More recently, deejays with raggamuffin-style vocals (bouyon-muffin) have moved to the fore, updating the sound for the New Generation. Due to the popularity of Triple K International, Ncore, and the New generation of bouyon bands who toured the French Antilles, a popular offshoot of bouyon from Guadeloupe is call bouyon gwada. The jump up had its heyday from the 90s with songs such as Met Veye WCK, but remained stamped background music or carnival. Over the years, thanks to inter-trade with the Dominicans and the mass participation of Guadeloupe at the World Creole Music Festival, the flagship group as Triple kay and MFR band began to democratize and local artists were inducted including the remix Allo Triple kay with Daly and \\"Big Ting Poppin 'Daly alone. A popular offshoot within the bouyon gwada is call bouyon hardcore, a style characterized by its lewd and violent lyrics. Popular Bouyon gwada musicians include, Wee Low, Suppa, Doc J, Yellow gaza, etc. =Popular folk music= Though zouk is the most well-known form of modern French Antillean music, the island of Martinique has also produced the chouval bwa and biguine styles, which were especially popular in the early 20th century. Chouval bwa is includes multiple distinctive instruments and internationally famous performers like Claude Germany, Dede Saint-Prix, Pakatak and Tumpak, while biguine has achieved international fame since the 1920s and has since been modernized and adapted for pop audiences, making it a major influence on zouk.De Ledesma, Charles and Gene Scaramuzzo Between the 1930s and 1950s, the dance biguine was popular among the islands' dance orchestras. The biguine uses a cinquillo variant related to that found in other Caribbean genres like m√©ringue and Compas. In the 1940s and 1950s, these dance bands absorbed influences from Cuban, American and Haitian popular music. Dutch Antilles The islands of Cura√ßao, Bonaire, Aruba, Sint Eustatius and Saint Martin share musical styles, as well as maintain their own sets of folk and popular dances, ranging from the impromptu Statian road block to calypso, zouk and soca.Cameron, p. 549‚Äì582. African, indigenous and European ancestry predominate, though more recent immigrants have brought musical styles from Lebanon, China and India. In popular music, the islands are known for the Combined Rhythm, like local favorites the Happy Peanuts and Expresando Rimto i Ambiente. Kaseko music from the mainland country Suriname is also popular. Traditional music of Aruba and the Netherlands Antilles, however, is primarily African, characterized by the use of complex, highly developed polyrhythms, dance styles and drums like the tamb√∫. Other African-derived instruments include metal percussion rods, agan, the rasp wiri, aerophones like the cachu trumpet, becu transverse double-reed wind instrument, and the bow benta.Garland Encyclopedia of World Music, pp. 927‚Äì931 The tambu is an instrument, and a form of music and dance found on Aruba, Bonaire (where it is sometimes known as bari), and Cura√ßao. The tambu is an especially important symbol of Cura√ßaoan identity. Instrumentation for the tambu uses the agan, chapi, triangle, wiri and other instruments, many of which are also part of the African-derived muziek di zumbi, or spirit music, of Cura√ßao.New Grove Encyclopedia of Music, pp 775‚Äì777 Cura√ßao's folk music also includes a rich tradition of work songs with apentatonic lyrics sung in Guene or a Papiamento variant called seshi. The Simadan harvest festival is found across the islands, and features the cachu trumpet, made from a cowhorn. Bonaire's Simadan festival is also notable for the use of the becu, an aerophone made from the stalk of a sorghum plant, and the kinkon, made from a conch shell and known elsewhere as the carco. Folk song forms range from the harvest seu, simadan and wapa. Other songs were imported beginning in the 19th century, including the South American joropo and pasillo, Spanish Caribbean merengue and other new songs, dances and instruments. This diverse mixture was the origin of the Dutch Antilles' most distinctive and long-standing popular tradition, the tumba. The smaller islands of Saint Martin, Saba and Sint Eustatius largely share in the same folk instruments, dances and songs as their neighbors; however, these islands remain largely unstudied. Saba is home to a vital percussive music tradition, most closely associated with private parties, using instrumentation similar to Cura√ßao, Bonaire and Aruba. Saint Martin is home to a national dance form called the ponum, which dates to the 19th century and was only displaced by string bands in the mid-20th century. Saint Martin is also home to a calypso-like quimbe song form, that remains a major part of the island's culture. Indo-Antillean Indo-Caribbean people in the Lesser Antillean music area are clustered in Guyana, Suriname, and Trinidad and Tobago. Indo-Caribbean folk traditions include the chowtal songs from the springtime festival phagwa, and Hindi bhajans which are still sung at temples despite there being few people who understand Hindi. Guyanese and Trinidadian Indo-Caribbeans developed a tradition that fused elements of calypso with the folk music of North India, a style that was referred to as local music.Manuel, East Indian Music in the West Indies, p. 212‚Äì221. Indo- Caribbean music plays a vital role in various annual festivals like the springtime phagwa, where chowtal is traditionally performed competitively and in teams. Indo-Caribbean Shia Muslims celebrate Hosay (Muharram) with floats accompanied by barrel drums called tassa. Wedding music is another important part of Indo-Caribbean music, and is dominated by tan singing. Tan singing is accompanied by the dholak drum and dhantal, and sometimes includes verbal duels influenced by picong. Indo-Caribbean popular music gained international attention in the late 1980s, with the rise of chutney music. Chutney is a dance music, in its modern form accompanied by soca instrumentation, such as synthesizers and pressure drums. This style is called chutney-soca.

It was published in 2001 in a larger format than the other Discworld novels and illustrated on every page by Paul Kidby. Plot summary A message, carried by pointless albatross, arrives for Lord Vetinari from the Agatean Empire. The message explains that the Silver Horde (a group of aged barbarians introduced in Interesting Times, wherein they conquered the Empire, and led by Cohen the Barbarian, now the Emperor) have set out on a quest. The first hero of the Discworld, \\"Fingers\\" Mazda, stole fire from the gods and gave it to mankind (analogous to Prometheus), and was chained to a rock to be torn open daily by a giant eagle as punishment. As the last heroes remaining on the Disc, the Silver Horde seek to return fire to the gods with interest, in the form of a large sled packed with explosive Agatean Thunder Clay. They plan to blow up the gods at their mountain home, Cori Celesti. With them is a whiny, terrified bard, whom they have kidnapped so that he can write the saga of their quest. Along the way, they are joined by Evil Harry Dread (the last Dark Lord) and Vena the Raven- haired (an elderly heroine who has now gone grey). The heroes are disillusioned with the way their lives have turned out‚Äîhaving conquered the Empire, they have nothing left to do but die in comfort‚Äîand are angry for having been allowed to grow old, rather than dying in battle as most of their friends did. They decided to go out on the quest after one of the Horde members choked to death on a cucumber. Evil Harry is just as angry; despite his efforts to give his opponents the sporting chance that an Evil Overlord should, they won't follow the Code by allowing him to escape in return. The Wizards of Unseen University explain to Lord Vetinari that blowing up Cori Celesti will destroy the Discworld by temporarily disrupting the Disc's magical field‚Äîthe only thing holding the Disc together‚Äîso Vetinari organises an effort to stop the Horde. Since the Horde is already near the centre of the Discworld and the home of the gods, speed is of the essence. Vetinari recruits Leonard of Quirm, who designs the Discworld's second known spacecraft to slingshot under the Discworld and back around the top, landing on Cori Celesti. The vessel, named \\"The Kite\\" by Leonard, can carry only three people. Leonard of Quirm, Captain Carrot Ironfoundersson, and Rincewind are selected for the trip. The Librarian accidentally stumbles aboard as well, having fallen asleep behind some crates of equipment while loading The Kite. After a few mishaps, including landing on the moon (to replenish their oxygen supply after the Librarian's unexpected presence threatened to leave them without enough air to survive the trip) and nearly having their swamp dragon powered spaceship explode on them, they crash in a spectacular fashion at, or rather, into the main gate of Cori Celesti. Meanwhile, the Horde have already reached Cori Celesti. The gods allow them to sneak in disguised as gods themselves, despite (or perhaps because of) their having been betrayed to the gods by Evil Harry. The Horde suspect that the gods have been manipulating their entire quest. Fate challenges Cohen to roll a 7 on a standard 6-sided die. Cohen cheats Fate by slicing the die in-half in mid-air with his sword; the two halves land with the 6 and 1 both facing up. Cohen also notes that even if he doesn't succeed in killing the gods, someone will have tried, so someone will eventually try harder. Captain Carrot attempts to arrest the Horde, at which point the Horde arms the explosives. While initially intending to attack him, the Horde realise that as a single brave man outnumbered by his foes and trying to save the world, Carrot is a Hero (and probably a king in disguise), and so their defeat is certain. After Rincewind explains that the detonation will destroy the entire Discworld, the Horde grab the explosives and throw them‚Äîand themselves‚Äîoff the mountain. As punishment for creating The Kite (which allowed humans to travel higher than the gods) and for not expressing belief in the gods, Leonard is ordered by the gods to paint the entire ceiling of the Temple of Small Gods with a spectacular mural of the whole world (despite Blind Io saying he would be satisfied with \\"a nice duck-egg blue with a few stars\\"). They impose a time limit of 10 years on the task‚Äîunassisted, \\"even with the scaffolding\\". (Leonard finishes the task in a few weeks.) Carrot asks for a boon to allow for the repairs of The Kite so that they can return to Ankh-Morpork. Rincewind asks for a blue balloon and the Librarian asks for some library supplies (and a red balloon) and manages to refrain from bouncing Blind Io's head on the ground after Io calls him 'a monkey'. The Horde's end is ambiguous. Valkyries come to take the heroes to the Halls of the Slain, where a feast has been prepared for them. Instead, the Silver Horde, refusing to accept their deaths, steal the valkyries' horses and set off to find other worlds to \\"do heroic stuff in.\\" Death does not appear to them, as he often does when Discworld characters die, although he subsequently appears to Vena, and is evasive about whether he is \\"collecting\\". After the Horde leave with the Valkyries' horses, their first stop is to visit Mazda where he is being punished, cut off his chains, give him something to drink, and leave him a sword so that he may deal with his punisher. The bard, changed by his experience, composes a new style of saga, one with musical accompaniment, about it.

Since 1556, it has also been the official church of the College of Arms in which many officers of arms have been buried. In 1666 it was destroyed in the Great Fire of London, after which it was rebuilt and merged with nearby St Peter's. The current church was designed by Sir Christopher Wren.Christopher Hibbert, Ben Weinreb et al, The London Encyclopaedia, 3rd ed. (London: Pan Macmillan, 2008); It is one of only four churches in the City of London to escape damage during World War II. History St Benet's traces its history back to the year 1111, when a church was built on the site and dedicated to St Benedict. Over time the name was abbreviated to St. Benet. To the west of the site was the watergate of Baynard's Castle, which is referenced in the biographies of Queen Anne Boleyn and Lady Jane Grey. Both the church and the castle were destroyed in the Great Fire of London in 1666. It was rebuilt by the architect Christopher Wren, and reopened in 1683. On 2 March 1706, Henrietta Hobart married Charles Howard, 9th Earl of Suffolk, a captain in the 6th (Inniskilling) Dragoons there. (Henrietta Howard subsequently became mistress to the future King George II.)Tracy Borman, King's Mistress, Queen's Servant: The Life and Times of Henrietta Howard (London: Vintage, 2010), p. 17.[2] The church was narrowly saved from destruction in the late 19th century, when its parish was merged with that of St Nicholas Cole Abbey. After an energetic campaign by its supporters, Queen Victoria in 1879 granted the church to Welsh Anglicans for services. St Benet's continues as London's Metropolitan Welsh church, with its services conducted in the Welsh language, and with English translation provided. =Present day= In 2008 the church was closed for a few months due to a \\"dwindling congregation\\" but reopened in time for the carol service in December that year. Services are held weekly on Sunday mornings at 11am, with occasional special services on Sunday afternoons at 3pm. The church can be toured on Thursdays between 11am and 3pm. The parish is within the Conservative Evangelical tradition of the Church of England, and it has passed resolutions to reject the ordination of women and/or female leadership. Exterior The church is of dark red brick, with alternating courses of Portland stone at the corners. The tower is situated to the north-west of the nave and is capped by a small lead dome, lantern and simple short spire. Interior Interior of St Benet Paul's Wharf The interior is almost a square. Unusually for a Wren church, the ceiling is flat rather than domed or barrel-vaulted. The north gallery was formerly used by the Doctors' Commons, and is now used by the College of Arms. Most of the original 17th-century furnishings are still intact, including the magnificent altar table, reredos and pulpit, designed by Grinling Gibbons. The lectern and baptismal font are also original. The galleries are supported by Corinthian columns. There is a memorial to Inigo Jones, who was buried in the previous church,\\"The City Churches\\" Tabor, M. p66:London; The Swarthmore Press Ltd; 1917 and a medallion bust of Sir Robert Wyseman, a benefactor of St Benet's who died in 1684.

It represents the ratio of the convective mass transfer to the rate of diffusive mass transport, and is named in honor of Thomas Kilgore Sherwood. It is defined as follows :\\\\mathrm{Sh} = \\\\frac{h}{D/L} = \\\\frac{\\\\mbox{Convective mass transfer rate}}{\\\\mbox{Diffusion rate}} where * L is a characteristic length (m) * D is mass diffusivity (m2.s‚àí1) * h is the convective mass transfer film coefficient (m.s‚àí1) Using dimensional analysis, it can also be further defined as a function of the Reynolds and Schmidt numbers: :\\\\mathrm{Sh} = f(\\\\mathrm{Re}, \\\\mathrm{Sc}) For example, for a single sphere it can be expressed as: :\\\\mathrm{Sh} = \\\\mathrm{Sh}_0 + C\\\\, \\\\mathrm{Re}^{m}\\\\, \\\\mathrm{Sc}^{\\\\frac{1}{3}} where \\\\mathrm{Sh}_0 is the Sherwood number due only to natural convection and not forced convection. A more specific correlation is the Froessling equation:Froessling, N. Uber die Verdunstung Fallender Tropfen (The Evaporation of Falling Drops). Gerlands Beitrage zur Geophysik, 52:107-216, 1938 :\\\\mathrm{Sh} = 2 + 0.552\\\\, \\\\mathrm{Re}^{\\\\frac{1}{2}}\\\\, \\\\mathrm{Sc}^{\\\\frac{1}{3}} This form is applicable to molecular diffusion from a single spherical particle. It is particularly valuable in situations where the Reynolds number and Schmidt number are readily available. Since Re and Sc are both dimensionless numbers, the Sherwood number is also dimensionless. These correlations are the mass transfer analogies to heat transfer correlations of the Nusselt number in terms of the Reynolds number and Prandtl number. For a correlation for a given geometry (e.g. spheres, plates, cylinders, etc.), a heat transfer correlation (often more readily available from literature and experimental work, and easier to determine) for the Nusselt number (Nu) in terms of the Reynolds number (Re) and the Prandtl number (Pr) can be used as a mass transfer correlation by replacing the Prandtl number with the analogous dimensionless number for mass transfer, the Schmidt number, and replacing the Nusselt number with the analogous dimensionless number for mass transfer, the Sherwood number. As an example, a heat transfer correlation for spheres is given by the Ranz-Marshall Correlation:Ranz, W. E. and Marshall, W. R. Evaporation from Drops. Chemical Engineering Progress, 48:141-146, 173-180, 1952. :\\\\mathrm{Nu} = 2 + 0.6\\\\, \\\\mathrm{Re}^{\\\\frac{1}{2}}\\\\, \\\\mathrm{Pr}^{\\\\frac{1}{3}}, ~ 0 \\\\le ~ \\\\mathrm{Re} <200, ~ 0 \\\\le \\\\mathrm{Pr} < 250 This correlation can be made into a mass transfer correlation using the above procedure, which yields: :\\\\mathrm{Sh} = 2 + 0.6\\\\, \\\\mathrm{Re}^{\\\\frac{1}{2}} \\\\, \\\\mathrm{Sc}^{\\\\frac{1}{3}}, ~ 0 \\\\le ~ \\\\mathrm{Re} < 200, ~ 0 \\\\le \\\\mathrm{Sc} < 250 This is a very concrete way of demonstrating the analogies between different forms of transport phenomena.

He succeeded his half-brother al- Amin after a civil war, during which the cohesion of the Abbasid Caliphate was weakened by rebellions and the rise of local strongmen; much of his reign was consumed in pacification campaigns. Well educated and with a considerable interest in scholarship, al-Ma'mun promoted the Translation Movement, the flowering of learning and the sciences in Baghdad, and the publishing of al- Khwarizmi's book now known as \\"Algebra\\". He is also known for supporting the doctrine of Mu'tazilism and for imprisoning Imam Ahmad bin Hanbal, the rise of religious persecution (mihna), and for the resumption of large-scale warfare with the Byzantine Empire. Birth and education Abdallah, the future al- Ma'mun, was born in Baghdad on the night of the 13 to 14 September 786 CE to Harun al-Rashid and his concubine Marajil, from Badghis. On the same night, which later became known as the \\"night of the three caliphs\\", his uncle al- Hadi died and was succeeded by Ma'mun's father, Harun al-Rashid, as ruler of the Abbasid Caliphate. Marajil died soon after his birth, and Abdallah was raised by Harun al-Rashid's wife, Zubayda, herself of high Abbasid lineage as the granddaughter of Caliph al-Mansur (). As a young prince, Abdallah received a thorough education: al-Kisa'i tutored him in classical Arabic, Abu Muhammad al-Yazidi in adab, and he received instruction in music and poetry. He was trained in fiqh by al-Hasan al-Lu'lu'i, showing particular excellence in the Hanafi school, and in the hadith, becoming himself active as a transmitter. According to M. Rekaya, \\"he was distinguished by his love of knowledge, making him the most intellectual caliph of the Abbasid family, which accounts for the way in which his caliphate developed\\". Appointment as successor and Governor of Khurasan Although Abdallah was the oldest of his sons, in 794 Harun named the second-born Muhammad, born in April 787 to Zubayda, as the first in line of succession. This was the result of family pressure on the Caliph, reflecting Muhammad's higher birth, as both parents descended from the Abbasid dynasty; indeed, he remained the only Abbasid caliph to claim such descent. Muhammad received the oath of allegiance (bay'ah) with the name of al-Amin (\\"The Trustworthy\\"), first in Khurasan by his guardian, the Barmakid al-Fadl ibn Yahya, and then in Baghdad. Abdallah was recognized as second heir only after entering puberty, in 799, under the name al-Ma'mun (\\"The Trusted One\\"), with another Barmakid, Ja'far ibn Yahya, as his guardian. At the same time, a third heir, al-Qasim, named al-Mu'tamin, was appointed, under the guardianship of Abd al-Malik ibn Salih. These arrangements were confirmed and publicly proclaimed in 802, when Harun and the most powerful officials of the Abbasid government made the pilgrimage to Mecca. Al-Amin would succeed Harun in Baghdad, but al-Ma'mun would remain al-Amin's heir and would additionally rule over an enlarged Khurasan. This was an appointment of particular significance, as Khurasan had been the starting-point of the Abbasid Revolution which brought the Abbasids to power, and retained a privileged position among the Caliphate's provinces. Furthermore, the Abbasid dynasty relied heavily on Khurasanis as military leaders and administrators. Many of the original Khurasani Arab army (Khurasaniyya) that came west with the Abbasids were given estates in Iraq and the new Abbasid capital, Baghdad, and became an elite group known as the abnƒÅ æ al-dawla (\\"sons of the state/dynasty\\"). This large- scale presence of an Iranian element in the highest circles of the Abbasid state, with the Barmakid family as its most notable representatives, was certainly a factor in the appointment of al-Ma'mun, linked through his mother with the eastern Iranian provinces, as heir and governor of Khurasan. The stipulations of the agreement, which were recorded in detail by the historian al-Tabari, accorded al-Mamun's Khurasani viceroyalty extensive autonomy. However, modern historians consider that these accounts may have been distorted by later apologists of al-Ma'mun in the latter's favour. Harun's third heir, al-Mu'tamin, received responsibility over the frontier areas with the Byzantine Empire in Upper Mesopotamia and Syria. Very quickly, the latent rivalry between the two brothers had important repercussions: almost immediately after the court returned to Baghdad in January 803, the Abbasid elites were shaken by the abrupt fall of the Barmakid family from power. On the one hand, this event may reflect the fact that the Barmakids had become indeed too powerful for the Caliph's liking, but its timing suggests that it was tied to the succession issue as well: with al-Amin siding with the abnƒÅ æ and al-Ma'mun with the Barmakids, and the two camps becoming more estranged every day, if al-Amin was to have a chance to succeed, the power of the Barmakids had to be broken. Al-Fadl ibn Sahl, a Kufan of Iranian origin whose father had converted to Islam and entered Barmakid service, replaced Ja'far ibn Yahya as al-Ma'mun's tutor. In 806 he also became al-Ma'mun's secretary (katib), an appointment that marked him out as the chief candidate for the vizierate should al-Ma'mun succeed to the throne. In 804, al-Ma'mun married his cousin, Umm Isa, a daughter of the Caliph al-Hadi (). The couple had two sons, Muhammad al-Asghar and Abdallah. The years after the fall of the Barmakids saw an increasing centralization of the administration and the concomitant rise of the influence of the abnƒÅ æ, many of whom were now dispatched to take up positions as provincial governors and bring these provinces under closer control from Baghdad. This led to unrest in the provinces, especially Khurasan, where local elites had a long-standing rivalry with the aabnƒÅ æ and their tendency to control of the province (and its revenues) from Iraq. The harsh taxation imposed by a prominent member of the abnƒÅ æ, Ali ibn Isa ibn Mahan, even led to a revolt under Rafi ibn al-Layth, which eventually forced Harun himself, accompanied by al-Ma'mun and the powerful chamberlain (hajib) and chief minister al-Fadl ibn al-Rabi, to travel to the province in 808. Al-Ma'mun was sent ahead with part of the army to Marv, while Harun stayed at Tus, where he died on 24 March 809. Abbasid civil war In 802 Harun al-Rashid, father of al-Ma æm≈´n and al-Amin, ordered that al-Amin succeed him, and al-Ma'mun serve as governor of Khurasan and as caliph after the death of al-Amin. In the last days of Harun's life his health was declining and saw in a dream Musa ibn Jafar sitting in a chamber praying and crying, which made Harun remember how hard he had struggled to establish his own caliphate. He knew the personalities of both his sons and decided that for the good of the Abbasid dynasty, al-Ma æm≈´n should be caliph after his death, which he confided to a group of his courtiers. One of the courtiers, Fadl ibn Rabi', did not abide by Harun's last wishes and convinced many in the lands of Islam that Harun's wishes had not changed. Later the other three courtiers of Harun who had sworn loyalty to Harun by supporting al-Ma æm≈´n, namely, 'Isa Jarudi, Abu Yunus, and Ibn Abi 'Umran, found loopholes in Fadl's arguments, and Fazl admitted Harun had appointed al-Ma æm≈´n after him, but, he argued, since Harun was not in his right mind, his decision should not be acted upon. Al-Ma æm≈´n was reportedly the older of the two brothers, but his mother was a Persian woman while al-Amin's mother was a member of the reigning Abbasid family. After al-Rashid's death in 809, the relationship between the two brothers deteriorated. In response to al-Ma'mun's moves toward independence, al-Amin declared his own son Musa to be his heir. This violation of al-Rashid's testament led to a succession struggle. Al-Amin assembled a massive army at Baghdad with 'Isa ibn Mahan at its head in 811 and invaded Khorasan, but al-Ma æm≈´n's general Tahir ibn al-Husayn (d. 822) destroyed the army and invaded Iraq, laying siege to Baghdad in 812. In 813 Baghdad fell, al-Amin was beheaded, and al-Ma æm≈´n became the undisputed Caliph. Internal strife There were disturbances in Iraq during the first several years of al- Ma æm≈´n's reign, while the caliph was in Merv. On 13 November 815, Muhammad ibn Ja'far al-Sadiq (Al-Dibaj) claimed the Caliphate for himself in Mecca. He was defeated and he quickly abdicated asserting that he had only become caliph on news that al-Ma'mun had died. Lawlessness in Baghdad led to the formation of neighborhood watches. In A.H. 201 (817 AD) al-Ma'mun forced Ali ar-Rida, a/k/a Imam Reza, to move from Madina to Merv. Imam Reza, the eighth descendant of Muhammad, was named his heir. This was not easily accepted by the Abbasid leaders but was widely seen as a political move by al-Ma'mun since he was fearful of the widespread sympathy towards the Ahl al-Bayt. Al-Ma'mun's plan was to keep watch over Imam Reza. However, his plans did not succeed due to the growing popularity of the Imam in Merv. People from all over the Muslim world traveled to meet the prophet's grandson and listen to his teachings and guidance. After a debate al-Ma'mun had set up with the greatest scholars of the world's religions to humiliate the Imam, the victorious Imam informed al- Ma'mun that his grand vizier, Fazl ibn Sahl, had not been informing him of everything. In Baghdad, the people believed that al-Ma æm≈´n was unseated, due to rumors spread by Fazl ibn Sahl, and so gave their allegiance to al-Mamun's uncle Ibrahim ibn Mehdi. Al-Ma'mun set out for Baghdad on 12 April 818. At Tus, he stopped to visit his father's grave. Al-Ma'mun was troubled by the widespread support for Imam Reza, a descendant of the prophet Muhammad, and the betrayal of his grand vizier. With the aim of gaining Abbasid support and the establishment of a new base for his rule in Baghdad, al-Ma'mun went on to dispose of Ali Ar-Rida by administering poison, and arranging the murder of Fazl ibn Sahl. On the last day of Safar in 203 AH, Imam Reza died, and was buried thereafter beside Al-Ma'mun's father HƒÅr≈´n al-Rashid. Following the death of Imam Reza, a great revolt took place in Khurasan. Al-Ma‚Äômun tried unsuccessfully to absolve himself of the crime.  After arrival in Baghdad  Silver Dirham of Al-Ma'mun. AH 199-218 / AD 813-833. Dirham weight 25mm, 3.19 g, 3h. Medinat Isbahan mint dated 205 AD (820/1 AD) Muhammad ibn Jarir al- Tabari states that al-Ma'mun entered Baghdad on 11 August 819 (v. 32, p. 95). He wore green and had others do so. Informed that compliance with this command might arouse popular opposition to the colour, on 18 August he reverted to traditional Abbasid black. While Baghdad became peaceful, there were disturbances elsewhere. In A.H. 210 (825‚Äì826 CE) Abdullah ibn Tahir al- Khurasani secured Egypt for al-Ma'mun, freeing Alexandria from Andalusians and quelling unrest. The Andalusians moved to Crete, where al-Tabari records their descendants were still living in his day (see Emirate of Crete). Abdallah returned to Baghdad in 211 Hijri (826‚Äì827 C.E.) bringing the defeated rebels with him. Also, in 210 Hijri (825‚Äì826 CE), there was an uprising in Qum sparked by complaints about taxes. After it was quashed, the tax assessment was set significantly higher. In 212 Hijri (827‚Äì828 CE), there was an uprising in Yemen. In 214 (829‚Äì30 CE), Abu al-Razi, who had captured one Yemeni rebel, was killed by another. Egypt continued to be unquiet. Sindh was rebellious. In 216 (831‚Äì832 CE), Ghassan ibn 'Abbad subdued it. An ongoing problem for al- Ma'mun was the uprising headed by Babak Khorramdin. In 214 Babak routed a Caliphate army killing its commander Muhammad ibn Humayd. Wars with Byzantium By the time al-Ma æm≈´n became Caliph, the Arabs and the Byzantine Empire had settled down into border skirmishing, with Arab raids deep into Anatolia to capture booty and Christians to be enslaved. The situation changed however with the rise to power of Michael II in 820 AD. Forced to deal with the rebel Thomas the Slav, Michael had few troops to spare against a small Andalusian invasion of 40 ships and 10,000 men against Crete, which fell in 824 AD. A Byzantine counter offensive in 826 AD failed miserably. Worse still was the invasion of Sicily in 827 by Arabs of Tunis. Even so, Byzantine resistance in Sicily was fierce and not without success whilst the Arabs became quickly plagued by internal squabbles. That year, the Arabs were expelled from Sicily but they were to return. John the Grammarian in 829 to Ma'mun (depicted left) from Theophilos (depicted right) In 829, Michael II died and was succeeded by his son Theophilos. Theophilos experienced mixed success against his Arab opponents. In 830 AD the Arabs returned to Sicily and, after a year-long siege, took Palermo. For the next 200 years they were to remain there to complete their conquest, which was never short of Christian counters. Al-Ma'mun meanwhile launched an invasion of Anatolia in 830 AD, taking a number of Byzantine forts; he spared the surrendering Byzantines. Theophilos, for his part, captured Tarsus in 831. The next year, learning the Byzantines had killed some sixteen hundred people, al-Ma'mun returned. This time some thirty forts fell to the Caliphate's forces, with two Byzantine defeats in Cappadocia. Theophilos wrote to al-Ma'mun. The Caliph replied that he carefully considered the Byzantine ruler's letter, noticed it blended suggestions of peace and trade with threats of war and offered Theophilos the options of accepting the shahada, paying tax or fighting. Al-Ma'mun made preparations for a major campaign, but died on the way while leading an expedition in Tyana. Abbasid Caliph Al-Ma'mun sends an envoy to Theophilos Al- Ma'mun's relations with the Byzantines are marked by his efforts in the translation of Greek philosophy and science. Al-Ma'mun gathered scholars of many religions at Baghdad, whom he treated magnificently. He sent an emissary to the Byzantine Empire to collect the most famous manuscripts there, and had them translated into Arabic.Lee S. Tesdell, \\"Greek Rhetoric and Philosophy in Medieval Arabic Culture: The State of the Research,\\" in: Discourses of Power: Grammar and Rhetoric in the Middle Ages, ed. Carol Poster and Richard Utz (Evanston, IL: Northwestern University Press, 1999), pp. 51‚Äì58. As part of his peace treaty with the Byzantine Emperor, Al-Ma'mun was to receive a number of Greek manuscripts annually, one of these being Ptolemy's astronomical work, the Almagest.  Al-Ma'mun's reign  Al-Ma'mun conducted, in the plains of Mesopotamia, two astronomical operations intended to determine the value of a terrestrial degree. The crater Almanon on the moon is named in recognition of his contributions to astronomy. Al-Ma'mun's record as an administrator is also marked by his efforts toward the centralization of power and the certainty of succession. The Bayt al-Hikma, or House of Wisdom, was established during his reign. The ulama emerged as a real force in Islamic politics during al- Ma'mun's reign for opposing the mihna, which was initiated in 833, four months before he died. Michael Hamilton Morgan in his book \\"Lost History\\" describes al-Ma'mun as a man who 'Loves Learning.' al-Ma'mun once defeated a Byzantine Emperor in a battle and as a tribute, he asked for a copy of Almagest, Ptolemy's Hellenistic compendium of thoughts on astronomy written around A.D. 150Michael Hamilton Morgan \\"Lost History\\", page. 57 The 'mihna', is comparable to Medieval European inquisitions in the sense that it involved imprisonment, a religious test, and a loyalty oath. The people subject to the mihna were traditionalist scholars whose social influence was uncommonly high. Al-Ma'mun introduced the mihna with the intention to centralize religious power in the caliphal institution and test the loyalty of his subjects. The mihna had to be undergone by elites, scholars, judges and other government officials, and consisted of a series of questions relating to theology and faith. The central question was about the createdness of the Qur'an, if the interrogatee stated he believed the Qur'an to be created, rather than coeternal with God, he was free to leave and continue his profession. The controversy over the mihna was exacerbated by al-Ma'mun's sympathy for Mu'tazili theology and other controversial views. Mu'tazili theology was deeply influenced by Aristotelian thought and Greek rationalism, and stated that matters of belief and practice should be decided by reasoning. This opposed the traditionalist and literalist position of Ahmad ibn Hanbal and others, according to which everything a believer needed to know about faith and practice was spelled out literally in the Qur'an and the Hadith. Moreover, the Mu'tazilis stated that the Qur'an was created rather than coeternal with God, a belief that was shared by the Jahmites and parts of Shi'a, among others, but contradicted the traditionalist-Sunni opinion that the Qur'an and the Divine were coeternal. During his reign, alchemy greatly developed. Pioneers of the science were Jabir Ibn Hayyan and his student Yusuf Lukwa, who was patronized by Al-Ma'mun. Although he was unsuccessful in transmuting gold, his methods greatly led to the patronization of pharmaceutical compounds.E.J. Brill's First Encyclopaedia of Islam (1993), Vol. 4, p. 1011 Caliph Al-Ma'mun was a pioneer of cartography having commissioned a world map from a large group of astronomers and geographers. The map is presently in an encyclopedia in Topkapi Sarai, a Museum in Istanbul. The map shows large parts of the Eurasian and African continents with recognizable coastlines and major seas. It depicts the world as it was known to the captains of the Arab sailing dhows which used the monsoon wind cycles to trade over vast distances (by the 9th century, Arab sea traders had reached Guangzhou, in China). The maps of the Greeks and Romans reveal a good knowledge of closed seas like the Mediterranean but little knowledge of the vast ocean expanses beyond. Although al-Mahdi had proclaimed that the caliph was the protector of Islam against heresy, and had also claimed the ability to declare orthodoxy, religious scholars in the Islamic world believed that al-Ma'mun was overstepping his bounds in the mihna. The penalties of the mihna became increasingly difficult to enforce as the ulema became firmer and more united in their opposition. Although the mihna persisted through the reigns of two more caliphs, al-Mutawakkil abandoned it in 848. The failure of the mihna seriously damaged Caliphal authority and ruined the reputation of the office for succeeding caliphs. The caliph would lose much of his religious authority to the opinion of the ulema as a result of the mihna. The ulema and the major Islamic law schools became truly defined in the period of al-Ma'mun, and Sunnism‚Äîas a religion of legalism‚Äîbecame defined in parallel. Doctrinal differences between Sunni and Shi'a Islam began to become more pronounced. Ibn Hanbal, the founder of the Hanbali legal school, became famous for his opposition to the mihna. Al-Ma'mun's simultaneous opposition and patronage of intellectuals led to the emergence of important dialogues on both secular and religious affairs, and the Bayt al- Hikma became an important center of translation for Greek and other ancient texts into Arabic. This Islamic renaissance spurred the rediscovery of Hellenism and ensured the survival of these texts into the European renaissance. Al-Ma'mun had been named governor of Khurasan by Harun, and after his ascension to power, the caliph named Tahir as governor for his military services in order to assure his loyalty. It was a move that al-Ma'mun soon regretted, as Tahir and his family became entrenched in Iranian politics and became increasingly powerful in the state, contrary to al-Ma'mun's desire to centralize and strengthen Caliphal power. The rising power of the Tahirid family became a threat as al-Ma'mun's own policies alienated them and his other opponents. Al-Ma'mun also attempted to divorce his wife during his reign, who had not borne him any children. His wife hired a Syrian judge of her own before al-Ma'mun was able to select one himself; the judge, who sympathized with the caliph's wife, refused the divorce. Following al-Ma'mun's experience, no further Abbasid caliphs were to marry, preferring to find their heirs in the harem. Al-Ma'mun, in an attempt to win over the Shi'a Muslims to his camp, named the eighth Imam, Ali ar-Rida, his successor, if he should outlive al-Ma'mun. Most Shi'ites realized, however, that ar-Rida was too old to survive him and saw al-Ma'mun's gesture as empty; indeed, Al-Ma'mun poisoned Ali ar-Rida who then died in 818. The incident served to further alienate the Shi'ites from the Abbasids, who had already been promised and denied the Caliphate by al-'Abbas. The Abbasid empire grew somewhat during the reign of al-Ma'mun. Hindu rebellions in Sindh were put down, and most of Afghanistan was absorbed with the surrender of the leader of Kabul. Mountainous regions of Iran were brought under a tighter grip of the central Abbasid government, as were areas of Turkestan. In 832, al-Ma'mun led a large army into Egypt to put down the last great Bashmurite revolt. While there he ordered the breaching of the Great Pyramid of Giza looking for knowledge and treasure. He entered the pyramid by tunneling into the Great Pyramid near where tradition located the original entrance. The resulting passage, which was later named the \\"Robbers' Tunnel\\" is the path along which tourists enter the pyramid today. Personal characteristics Al-Tabari (v. 32, p. 231) describes al-Ma'mun as of average height, light complexion, handsome and having a long beard losing its dark colour as he aged. He relates anecdotes concerning the caliph's ability to speak concisely and eloquently without preparation, his generosity, his respect for Muhammad and religion, his sense of moderation, justice and his love of poetry and his insatiable passion for physical intimacy. Ibn Abd Rabbih in his Unique Necklace (al-'iqd al-Farid), probably drawing on earlier sources, makes a similar description of al-Ma'mun, whom he described as of light complexion and having slightly blond hair, a long thin beard, and a narrow forehead. Family Al-Ma'mun had one official wife, Umm Isa, a daughter of his uncle al-Hadi (), whom he married when he was eighteen years old. They had two sons, Muhammad al-Asghar, and Abdallah. Al- Ma'mun had also numerous concubines. One of them, Sundus, bore him five sons, among whom was al-Abbas, who rose to become a senior military commander at the end of al-Ma'mun's reign and a contender for the throne. Death Al-Tabari (v.32, pp. 224‚Äì231) recounts how Al-Ma'mun was sitting on the river bank telling those with him how splendid the water was. He asked what would go best with this water and was told a specific kind of fresh dates. Noticing supplies arriving, he asked someone to check whether such dates were included. As they were, he invited those with him to enjoy the water with these dates. All who did this fell ill. Others recovered, but Al-Ma'mun died. He encouraged his successor to continue his policies and not burden the people with more than they could bear. This was on 9 August 833. Al-Ma'mun died near Tarsus. The city's major mosque (Tarsus Grand Mosque), contains a tomb reported to be his. He was not succeeded by his son, Al-Abbas ibn al-Ma'mun, but by his half- brother, al-Mu'tasim. Legacy Almanon is a lunar impact crater that lies in the rugged highlands in the south-central region of the Moon. It was named after Abbasid Caliph and astronomer Al-Ma'mun. Image of Almanon (crater) It is located to the south-southeast of Abulfeda, and to the north-northeast of the smaller crater Geber. The crater chain designated Catena Abulfeda forms a line between the south rim of Abulfeda and the north rim of Almanon, continuing for a length of about 210 kilometers to the Rupes Altai scarp. Religious beliefs Fals (Copper Coin) of Al-Ma'mun. 199-218 AH /813-833 AD. Fals, al- Quds (Jerusalem) mint. Dated AH 217 (AD 832/3) Under the Umayyad Caliphate Jerusalem was known by its Roman name Iliya Filastin (Arabic names for Palestine), but from the time of Caliph al Mamun it was given the Islamic religious name al-Quds (meaning holiness or sanctity). Al-Ma æm≈´n‚Äôs religious beliefs are a subject of controversy, to the point where other Abbasids,Naqawƒ´, \\"Ta æthƒ´r-i qƒ´yƒÅmhƒÅ-yi  øalawƒ´yƒÅn\\", p. 141. as well as later Islamic scholars, called him a Shia Muslim. For instance, Sunni scholars al- Dhahabi, Ibn Kathir, Ibn Khaldun and al-Suyuti explicitly held the belief that al-Ma'mun was a Shi'a.Dhahabƒ´, Siyar a ølƒÅm al-nubalƒÅ æ, vol. 11, p. 236; Ibn Kathƒ´r, al-BidƒÅya wa l-nihƒÅya, vol. 10, p. 275-279; Ibn khald≈´n. al- øIbar, vol. 2, p. 272; Suy≈´·π≠ƒ´, TƒÅrƒ´kh al-khulafƒÅ æ, p. 363. The arguments for his alleged Shi‚Äôism include that, in 816/817, when Ali al-Ridha, the Prophet's descendant, refused designation as sole Caliph, Al-Ma'mun officially designated him as his appointed successor. The official Abbasid coins were minted showing Al-Ma'mun as a Caliph and al-Ridha as his successor.https://www.vcoins.com/en/stores/cyrus_coins/28/product/item_13113_abbasid_medieval_islam_almamun_ah_194218_silver_dirham_204ah_isfahan_mint__with_ali_ibn_musa_alrida_as_heir__rare_album_224__difficult_to_find/564808/Default.aspx Other arguments were that: the Caliphate‚Äôs official black colour was changed to the Prophetic green; in 210 AH/825 CE, he wrote to Qutham b. Ja'far, the ruler of Medina, to return Fadak to the descendants of Muhammad through his daughter, Fatima; he restored nikah mut'ah, previously banned by Umar ibn al- Khattab, but practiced under Muhammad and Abu Bakr; in 211 AH/826 CE, al- Ma'mun expressed his antipathy to those who praised Mu'awiya ibn Abi Sufyan, and punished such people;Suy≈´·π≠ƒ´, TƒÅrƒ´kh al-khulafƒÅ æ, p. 364. in 212 AH/827 CE, al-Ma'mun announced the superiority of Ali ibn Abu Talib over Abu Bakr and 'Umar b. al-Khattab;Suy≈´·π≠ƒ´, TƒÅrƒ´kh al-khulafƒÅ æ, p. 364. in 833 CE, under the influence of Mu øtazila rationalist thought, he initiated the mihna ordeal, where he accepted the Shia argument that the Quran was created at some point over the Sunni belief that the Book was coeternal with God. However, mainstream Shi‚Äôite belief is that al-Ma'mun was responsible for Ali al-Ridha‚Äôs poisoning and eventual death in 818 CE. In the ensuing power struggle, other Abbasids sought to depose Ma'mun in favor of Ibrahim ibn al-Mahdi, Ma'mun's uncle;Donaldson, Dwight M. (1933). The Shi'ite Religion: A History of Islam in Persia and Irak. BURLEIGH PRESS. pp. 161‚Äì170. therefore, getting rid of al- Ridha was the only realistic way of retaining united, absolute, unopposed rule.According to Madelung the unexpected death of the Alid successor, \\"whose presence would have made any reconciliation with the powerful  øAbbasid opposition in Baghdad virtually impossible, must indeed arouse strong suspicion that Ma'mun had had a hand in the deaths.\\" Al-Ma'm≈´n ordered that al-Ridha be buried next to the tomb of his own father, Harun al-Rashid, and showed extreme sorrow in the funeral ritual and stayed for three days at the place. Muhammad al-Jawad, Ali al-Ridha‚Äôs son and successor, lived unopposed and free during the rest of Al-Ma'm≈´n‚Äôs reign (till 833 CE). The Caliph summoned al-Jawad to Baghdad in order to marry his daughter, Ummul Fadhl. This apparently provoked strenuous objections by the Abbasids. According to Ya'qubi, al-Ma'mun gave al-Jawad one hundred thousand dirham and said, \\"Surely I would like to be a grandfather in the line of the Apostle of God and of Ali ibn Abu Talib.\\"Donaldson, Dwight M.

Barefooting requires the skier to travel at higher speeds than conventional water skiing (30-45mph/50-70km/h). The necessary speed required to keep the skier upright varies by the weight of the barefooter and can be approximated by the following formula: (W / 10) + 20, where W is the skier's weight in pounds and the result is in miles per hour. It is an act performed in show skiing, and on its own. History of barefooting Barefoot water skiing originated in Winter Haven, Florida. According to the Water Ski Hall of Fame, and witnesses of the event, 17-year-old A.G. Hancock became the first person ever to barefoot water ski in 1947. That same year, Richard Downing \\"Dick\\" Pope Jr., was the first person ever to be photographed barefooting, stepping off his skis on a training boom alongside the boat. In 1950, the first barefoot competition was held in Cypress Gardens, with Pope and Mexican competitor Emilio Zamudio as the only two known barefooters in the world at the time. The first woman to waterski barefoot was Charlene Zint in 1951. http://novaphoto.tumblr.com/post/41292855387/charlene-zint-first-woman-to- barefoot-water-ski Throughout the 1950s, additional barefoot starting techniques were invented including the two-ski jump out, the beach start (invented by Ken Tibado in 1955), and the deep water start (invented by Joe Cash in 1958). The tumble-turn maneuver was 'invented' by accident during a double barefoot routine in 1960 when Terry Vance fell onto his back during a step-off and partner Don Thomson (still on his skis) spun him around forward, enabling Vance to regain a standing posture. In 1961, Randy Rabe became the first backward barefooter by stepping off a trick ski backwards, a maneuver Dick Pope had first tried in 1950 but vowed never to try again after a painful fall. The early 1960s saw Don Thomson appear as the first \\"superstar\\" of the sport, developing both back-to-front and front-to-back turnarounds, and performing the first barefoot tandem ride in a show at Cypress Gardens. During this time barefooting began developing in Australia as well. In April 1963, the first national competition was held in Australia, with 38 competitors . The Australians were the first to develop barefoot jumping, one of the three events in modern barefoot competition, as well as pioneer many new tricks. In November 1978, the first world championships were held in Canberra, Australia, where 54 skiers competed for a total of 10 different countries . Australians Brett Wing and Colleen Wilkinson captured the men's and women's titles. In 1976 Briton Keith Donnelly set the first (officially recognized) World Barefoot Jump record of 13.25 meters. In 2019 the sport was rebranded to foot skiing by world champion barefooter Brendan Paige from Australia. Equipment Equipment required for barefooting: * Boat ‚Äì Barefooting requires a boat or other towing object that can travel to a speed of 30-45mph with a barefooter under tow. Some boats are made specifically for barefooting, as they have small wakes and can travel at fast speeds. ABC Boats maintains a current list of boats approved by the American Barefoot Club. * Handles and ropes ‚Äì Normally a handled rope is used but may be optionally replaced with a ski boom (see below). A safety release may be used with the rope so that it can be detached from the boat in the event the barefooter becomes tangled in the rope. Though it is possible to barefoot with a normal 75.00 foot nylon tow rope and handle, many skiers use special ropes made out of Poly-E or Spectra to reduce spring. Barefoot handles have plastic tubing around them, so the skier can wrap their feet around the rope without getting rope burn and can have small modifications for frontward and backward toe holds. * Personal Flotation Device ‚Äì It is recommended and in many locations required that skiers and barefooters wear a flotation device or padded wetsuit. * Helmet - In many locations, it is only required for jump. Optional equipment: * Barefoot wetsuit ‚Äì The skier wears a fitted, padded neoprene barefoot wetsuit which has built-in flotation so that the need of a life jacket is unnecessary. It is possible to ski with a Coast Guard approved Type III flotation vest though this does not pad the skier well and the skier will not be able to perform many tricks. Some barefoot wetsuit manufactures include Eagle, Vortex and Barefoot International. * Padded shorts ‚Äì Though not necessary, many barefooters wear padded neoprene shorts. These help pad the skier's buttocks which is very helpful in performing the deep water start and tumble turns. * Booms ‚Äì Barefoot booms are used for learning barefooting and also, learning new barefoot tricks. The boom is a long pole that hangs over the edge of the boat and allows the barefooter to ski directly alongside the boat. Because the pole is fixed the barefooter may lean his or her body weight onto the pole and recover from falls more easily than on a rope. * Shoe Skis ‚Äì Shoe skis may be used for training. Shoe skis are small 'skis' put on the foot that are only a few inches longer and wider than the skier's foot. Shoe skiing is performed at a much lower speed (approx 18.00 mph) than barefooting because of the increased lift provided by the surface area of the ski. As an intermediate step to barefooting, flat soled street shoes may also be worn. This provides more lift than bare feet, but a more similar experience to barefooting than actual wooden 'shoe skis'. Competition Barefoot Jumping Barefoot water skiing has a competitive aspect which is very established. In traditional competition, there are three events: * Tricks ‚Äì The skier has two passes of 15 seconds to complete as many different tricks as possible. All tricks have specific point values depending on difficulty. The skier also is awarded points for the start trick they performed to get up. Mikey Caruso is the youngest barefoot water skier to ever compete longline in a tournament at the age of three at the 1988 Banana George Blairfoot Bananza, where he borrowed Parks Bonifay's wetsuit. The current world record for Men's Open division is 13,350 points set by David Small on August 14, 2018 For the Women's Open division the world record is 10,100 pts. set by Ashleigh Stebbeings on March 13, 2014. In the Boy's division Jackson Gerard set a record of 12.850 points on July 28, 2018. It also counted as the Men's Open record until broken two weeks later by World Barefoot Center teammate David Small. For the Girls division a record of 7400 points was set by Georgia Groen on April 1, 2013. * Slalom ‚Äì The skier has two passes of 15 seconds to cross the wake as many times as possible. The skier can cross the wake forwards or backwards and on two feet or one foot. The world record for Men's Open division was set by Keith St. Onge on January 6, 2006 (20.6). Ashleigh Stebbeings set the Women's Open division world record on October 8, 2014 with a score of 17.2 points. The Boys division world record of 19.2 pts. was set on January 6, 2006 by Heinrich Sam. It was tied by Jackson Gerard on August 16, 2018. Nadine De Villiers set the Girl's division world record of 16.1 pts. on April 5, 1997. * Jump ‚Äì The skier travels over a small, fiberglass jump ramp. They have three jumps and the longest one successfully landed counts. Professionals can jump as far as 90 feet (27.4 meters). The current world record for Men's Open division of 29.9 meters (98.1 feet) was set by David Small on August 11, 2010. With a jump of 23.4 meters (76.8 feet) Ashleigh Stebbeings set the Women's Open world record on February 19, 2017. Tee-Jay Russo jumped 26.7 meters (87.6 feet) to set the Boy's division world record on December 29, 2018 The Girl's division world record of 12.1 Meters (39.7 feet) was set by Kim Rowswell on August 13, 2010.https://worldbarefootcouncil.com/docs/Current_World_Records_Jan14_2019.pdf For more information on rules, see the World Barefoot Council. Some other barefoot competitions feature endurance events. These include: * Figure 8 ‚Äì Two skiers on opposite sides of the wake ski while the boat drives in the pattern of a figure 8. The skier who is the last one standing wins. * Team Endurance ‚Äì This is a race between a variety of teams. Each team has a boat and the skiers take turns skiing. This generally takes place on a long river, where race distances can be up to about 45 miles. The first team to cross the finish line wins. The newest form of Barefoot competition is an event which brings together all three events Tricks, Slalom and Jump into a single set.

WHEREIN It is examined whether the Object, Principles, and Inferences of the modern Analysis are more distinctly conceived, or more evidently deduced, than Religious Mysteries and Points of Faith\\", is a book published by George Berkeley in 1734. The \\"infidel mathematician\\" is believed to have been Edmond Halley, though others have speculated Sir Isaac Newton was intended. See . Background and purpose  From his earliest days as a writer, Berkeley had taken up his satirical pen to attack what were then called 'free-thinkers' (secularists, skeptics, agnostics, atheists, etc.‚Äîin short, anyone who doubted the truths of received Christian religion or called for a diminution of religion in public life). In 1732, in the latest installment in this effort, Berkeley published his Alciphron, a series of dialogues directed at different types of 'free-thinkers'. One of the archetypes Berkeley addressed was the secular scientist, who discarded Christian mysteries as unnecessary superstitions, and declared his confidence in the certainty of human reason and science. Against his arguments, Berkeley mounted a subtle defense of the validity and usefulness of these elements of the Christian faith. Alciphron was widely read and caused a bit of a stir. But it was an offhand comment mocking Berkeley's arguments by the 'free-thinking' royal astronomer Sir Edmund Halley that prompted Berkeley to pick up his pen again and try a new tack. The result was The Analyst, conceived as a satire attacking the foundations of mathematics with the same vigor and style as 'free-thinkers' routinely attacked religious truths. Berkeley sought to take mathematics apart, claimed to uncover numerous gaps in proof, attacked the use of infinitesimals, the diagonal of the unit square, the very existence of numbers, etc. The general point was not so much to mock mathematics or mathematicians, but rather to show that mathematicians, like Christians, relied upon incomprehensible 'mysteries' in the foundations of their reasoning. Moreover, the existence of these 'superstitions' was not fatal to mathematical reasoning, indeed it was an aid. So too with the Christian faithful and their 'mysteries'. Berkeley concluded that the certainty of mathematics is no greater than the certainty of religion.  Content  The Analyst was a direct attack on the foundations of calculus, specifically on Newton's notion of fluxions and on Leibniz's notion of infinitesimal change. In section 16, Berkeley criticizes > ...the fallacious way of proceeding to a certain Point on the Supposition of > an Increment, and then at once shifting your Supposition to that of no > Increment . . . Since if this second Supposition had been made before the > common Division by o, all had vanished at once, and you must have got > nothing by your Supposition. Whereas by this Artifice of first dividing, and > then changing your Supposition, you retain 1 and nxn-1. But, notwithstanding > all this address to cover it, the fallacy is still the same. Its most frequently quoted passage: > And what are these Fluxions? The Velocities of evanescent Increments? And > what are these same evanescent Increments? They are neither finite > Quantities nor Quantities infinitely small, nor yet nothing. May we not call > them the ghosts of departed quantities?Ibid., p. 59. Berkeley did not dispute the results of calculus; he acknowledged the results were true. The thrust of his criticism was that Calculus was not more logically rigorous than religion. He instead questioned whether mathematicians \\"submit to Authority, take things upon Trust\\"Ibid., p. 93. just as followers of religious tenets did. According to Burton, Berkeley introduced an ingenious theory of compensating errors that were meant to explain the correctness of the results of calculus. Berkeley contended that the practitioners of calculus introduced several errors which cancelled, leaving the correct answer. In his own words, \\"by virtue of a two fold mistake you arrive, though not at science, yet truth.\\"Ibid., p. 34.  Analysis  The idea that Newton was the intended recipient of the discourse is put into doubt by a passage that appears toward the end of the book: \\"Query 58: Whether it be really an effect of Thinking, that the same Men admire the great author for his Fluxions, and deride him for his Religion?\\" Ibid., p. 92. Here Berkeley ridicules those who celebrate Newton (the inventor of \\"fluxions\\", roughly equivalent to the differentials of later versions of the differential calculus) as a genius while deriding his well-known religiosity. Since Berkeley is here explicitly calling attention to Newton's religious faith, that seems to indicate he did not mean his readers to identify the \\"infidel (i.e., lacking faith) mathematician\\" with Newton. Mathematics historian Judith Grabiner comments, ‚ÄúBerkeley‚Äôs criticisms of the rigor of the calculus were witty, unkind, and ‚Äî with respect to the mathematical practices he was criticizing ‚Äî essentially correct‚Äù . While his critiques of the mathematical practices were sound, his essay has been criticized on logical and philosophical grounds. For example, David Sherry argues that Berkeley's criticism of infinitesimal calculus consists of a logical criticism and a metaphysical criticism. The logical criticism is that of a fallacia suppositionis, which means gaining points in an argument by means of one assumption and, while keeping those points, concluding the argument with a contradictory assumption. The metaphysical criticism is a challenge to the existence itself of concepts such as fluxions, moments, and infinitesimals, and is rooted in Berkeley's empiricist philosophy which tolerates no expression without a referent . Andersen (2011) showed that Berkeley's doctrine of the compensation of errors contains a logical circularity. Namely, Berkeley relies upon Apollonius's determination of the tangent of the parabola in Berkeley's own determination of the derivative of the quadratic function.  Influence  Two years after this publication, Thomas Bayes published anonymously \\"An Introduction to the Doctrine of Fluxions, and a Defence of the Mathematicians Against the Objections of the Author of the Analyst\\" (1736), in which he defended the logical foundation of Isaac Newton's calculus against the criticism outlined in The Analyst. Colin Maclaurin's two-volume Treatise of Fluxions published in 1742 also began as a response to Berkeley attacks, intended to show that Newton's calculus was rigorous by reducing it to the methods of Greek geometry . Despite these attempts calculus continued to be developed using non-rigorous methods until around 1830 when Augustin Cauchy, and later Bernhard Riemann and Karl Weierstrass, redefined the derivative and integral using a rigorous definition of the concept of limit. The concept of using limits as a foundation for calculus had been suggested by d'Alembert, but d'Alembert's definition was not rigorous by modern standards . The concept of limits had already appeared in the work of Newton , but was not stated with sufficient clarity to hold up to the criticism of Berkeley . In 1966, Abraham Robinson introduced Non-standard Analysis, which provided a rigorous foundation for working with infinitely small quantities. This provided another way of putting calculus on a mathematically rigorous foundation that was in a similar spirit to the way calculus was done before the (Œµ, Œ¥)-definition of limit had been fully developed. = Ghosts of departed quantities = Towards the end of The Analyst, Berkeley addresses possible justifications for the foundations of calculus that mathematicians may put forward. In response to the idea fluxions could be defined using ultimate ratios of vanishing quantities , Berkeley wrote: > It must, indeed, be acknowledged, that [Newton] used Fluxions, like the > Scaffold of a building, as things to be laid aside or got rid of, as soon as > finite Lines were found proportional to them. But then these finite > Exponents are found by the help of Fluxions. Whatever therefore is got by > such Exponents and Proportions is to be ascribed to Fluxions: which must > therefore be previously understood. And what are these Fluxions? The > Velocities of evanescent Increments? And what are these same evanescent > Increments? They are neither finite Quantities nor Quantities infinitely > small, nor yet nothing. May we not call them the Ghosts of departed > Quantities?Ibid., p. 59. Edwards describes this as the most memorable point of the book . Katz and Sherry argue that the expression was intended to address both infinitesimals and Newton's theory of fluxions. Today the phrase \\"ghosts of departed quantities\\" is also used when discussing Berkeley's attacks on other possible foundations of Calculus. In particular it is used when discussing infinitesimals , but it is also used when discussing differentials , and adequality .

To combat this, builders began plastering their bale structures; if cement or lime stucco was unavailable, locally obtained \\"gumbo mud\\" was employed. Between 1896 and 1945, an estimated 70 straw-bale buildings, including houses, farm buildings, churches, schools, offices, and grocery stores had been built in the Sandhills. In 1990, nine surviving bale buildings were reported in Arthur and Logan Counties,Kay, John, David Anthone, Robert Kay, and Christina Hugly (1990). \\"Nebraska Historic Buildings Survey, Reconnaissance Survey Final Report of Arthur County, Nebraska.\\" Nebraska State Historical Society. Retrieved 2010-08-29. including the 1928 Pilgrim Holiness Church in the village of Arthur, which is listed in the National Register of Historic Places. Since the 1990s straw-bale construction has been substantially revived, particularly in North America, Europe, and Australia. This revival is likely attributed to greater environmental awareness and the material's natural, non-toxic qualities, low embodied energy, and relative affordability. Straw-bale construction has encountered issues regarding building codes depending on the location of the building.Kathryn Henderson Science, Technology, & Human Values, Vol. 31, No. 3, Ethics and Engineering Design (May, 2006), pp. 261-288 However, in the USA, the introduction of Appendices S and R in the 2015 International Residential Code has helped to legitimize and improve understanding of straw-bale construction. In France, the approval in 2012 of professional rules for straw-building recognized it as ‚Äúcommon technology‚Äù and qualifies for standard-insurance programs.http://rfcp.fr/les-regles-professionnelles/ Method Straw bale building typically consists of stacking rows of bales (often in running-bond) on a raised footing or foundation, with a moisture barrier or capillary break between the bales and their supporting platform. There are two types of straw- bales commonly used, those bound together with two strings and those with three. The three string bale is the larger in all three dimensions. Bale walls can be tied together with pins of bamboo or wood (internal to the bales or on their faces), or with surface wire meshes, and then stuccoed or plastered, either with a lime-based formulation or earth/clay render. The bales may actually provide the structural support for the building (\\"load-bearing\\" or \\"Nebraska-style\\" technique), as was the case in the original examples from the late 19th century. The plastered bale assembly also can be designed to provide lateral and shear support for wind and seismic loads. This straw bale house plastered with loam earthen plaster is located in Swalmen, in the southeastern Netherlands Alternatively, bale buildings can have a structural frame of other materials, usually lumber or timber-frame, with bales simply serving as insulation and plaster substrate, (\\"infill\\" or \\"non-loadbearing\\" technique), which is most often required in northern regions and/or in wet climates. In northern regions, the potential snow-loading can exceed the strength of the bale walls. In wet climates, the imperative for applying a vapor-permeable finish precludes the use of cement-based stucco. Additionally, the inclusion of a skeletal framework of wood or metal allows the erection of a roof prior to raising the bales, which can protect the bale wall during construction, when it is the most vulnerable to water damage in all but the most dependably arid climates. A combination of framing and load-bearing techniques may also be employed, referred to as \\"hybrid\\" straw bale construction. Straw bale construction Straw bales can also be used as part of a Spar and Membrane Structure (SMS) wall system in which lightly reinforced 5 \\\\- 8 cm (2 - 3\\") gunite or shotcrete skins are interconnected with extended \\"X\\" shaped light rebar in the head joints of the bales.Black, Gary, and Mannik, Henri, \\"Spar and Membrane Structure\\" The Last Straw journal, #17, Winter 1997 In this wall system the concrete skins provide structure, seismic reinforcing, and fireproofing, while the bales are used as leave-in formwork and insulation. The University of Bath has completed a research programme which used ‚ÄòModCell‚Äô panels - pre-fabricated panels consisting of a wooden structural frame infilled with straw bales and rendered with a breathable lime-based system - to build 'BaleHaus', a straw bale construction on the university's campus. Monitoring work of the structure carried out by architectural researchers at the university has found that as well as reducing the environmental footprint, the construction offers other benefits, including healthier living through higher levels of thermal insulation and regulation of humidity levels. The group has published a number of research papers on its findings. Typically \\"field bales\\" (bales created on farms with baling machines) have been used, but recently higher-density \\"precompressed\\" bales (or \\"straw-blocks\\") are increasing the loads that may be supported. Field bales might support around 900 kg per linear meter of wall (600 lb./ lin. ft.), but the high density bales bear up to 6000 kg per linear meter of wall (4,000 lb./lin.ft.), and more. The basic bale-building method is now increasingly being extended to bound modules of other oft-recycled materials, including tire-bales, cardboard, paper, plastic, and used carpeting. The technique has also been extended to bags containing \\"bales\\" of wood chips or rice hulls. Straw bales have also been used in very energy efficient high performance buildings such as the S-House in Austria which meets the Passivhaus energy standard. In South Africa, a five-star lodge made from 10,000 strawbales has housed luminaries such as Nelson Mandela and Tony Blair. In the Swiss Alps, in the little village of Nax Mont-Noble, construction works have begun in October 2011 for the first hotel in Europe built entirely with straw bales. The Harrison Vault, in Joshua Tree, California, is engineered to withstand the high seismic loads in that area using only the assembly consisting of bales, lath and plaster. The technique was used successfully for strawbale housing in rural China. Straw bale domes along the Syrio-African rift at Kibbutz Lotan have an interior geodesic frame of steel pipes.EcoCampus, Center for Creative Ecology, Kibbutz Lotan Another method to reap the benefits of straw is to incorporate straw-bale walls into a pre-existing structure.Whitty, Cadmon. \\"I Wrapped My House in Straw: A Straw Bale Builder Turns an Ugly old, Energy-Eating House into a Cozy, Efficient Home with a Unique Straw Bale Retrofit Process.\\" Natural Life Sept.-Oct. 2009 Print. Thermal properties Interior view of straw bale library Compressed straw bales have a wide range of documented R-value. R-value is a measurement of a materials insulating quality, higher the number the more insulating. The reported R-value ranges from 17-55 (in American units) or 3-9.6 (in SI) depending on the study, differing wall designs could be responsible for wide range in R-value. given that the bales are over a foot thick, the R-value per inch is lower than most other commercial insulation types including batts (3-4) and foamboard (~5). Bale walls are typically coated with a thick layer of plaster, which provides a well-distributed thermal mass, active on a short-term (diurnal) cycle. The combination of insulation and mass provide an excellent platform for passive solar building design for winter and summer. Compressed and plastered straw bale walls are also resistant to fire. Problems with straw-bale Two significant problems related to straw-bale construction are moisture and mold. During the construction phase, buildings need to be protected from rain and from water leakages into the body of the walls.http://thesustainablehome.net/do-straw-bale-buildings-last/ If exposed to water, compressed straw may expand due to absorption of moisture. In turn, this can cause more cracking through which more moisture can infiltrate. Further damage to the wall can be caused by mold releasing potentially toxic spores into the wall cavities and into the air.https://www.nachi.org/strawbalehomebasics2006.htm In hot climates, where walls may have become internally dampened, internal temperatures may rise (due to decomposition of affected straw). Rats and mice can infiltrate straw bale homes during construction, so care must be taken to keep such animals out of the material. Other problems relate to straw dust which may cause breathing difficulties among people with allergies to straw or hay.http://envibuild.eu/archive/2014/proceedings2014/enviBUILD-2014-proceedings.pdfhttp://emedicine.medscape.com/article/298811-overview Several companies have developed prefabricated strawbale walls. A passive ecological house can easily be assembled with those panels.

The film's plot chronicles a group of nerds at the fictional Adams College trying to stop the ongoing harassment by the jock fraternity, the Alpha Betas, in addition to the latter's sister sorority, Pi Delta Pi. Plot Best friends and nerds Lewis Skolnick and Gilbert Lowe enroll in Adams College to study computer science. The Alpha Betas, a fraternity that includes most of the Adams football team, carelessly burn down their own house and, urged by Coach Harris, take over the freshman dorms. Dean Ulich designates temporary living space in the gymnasium and allows the freshmen to rush the fraternities. Lewis, Gilbert, and several other nerds fail to join fraternities, but are able to secure a dilapidated house near campus and repair it as a residence. The Alpha Betas, led by star quarterback Stan Gable, are irked by the nerds' success, and Stan sets his fellow members to pull pranks against the nerds. The nerds try to get campus police to help, but the campus cops are constrained by the Greek Council that adjudicates all such pranks, of which Stan is currently president. The nerds decide to seek membership on the Greek Council by joining a national fraternity. The only one that considers them is the black fraternity Lambda Lambda Lambda (Tri-Lambs), led by U.N. Jefferson. Jefferson is wary of their application but agrees to a probationary period. The nerds set up a large party with the Omega Mu sorority, similarly made up of nerds, including Gilbert's girlfriend Judy, and invite Jefferson to attend. The party is dull until Booger provides them with high quality marijuana. The Alpha Betas and the Pi Delta Pis, the sorority which Stan's girlfriend Betty Childs belongs to, then disrupt the party by bringing and releasing pigs. The nerds exact revenge on both groups by pulling similar pranks. Jefferson is impressed with the nerds' tenacity and grants them full membership. The nerds then appeal to the Council, but Gable is dismissive. The nerds realize the only way to get the Council to help is to put one of their own in as president, which they can do by winning the Greek Games during Homecoming. Partnering with the Omega Mus and using their extensive knowledge, the Tri-Lambs compete strongly with the Alpha Betas/Pi Delta Pis during the athletic events. At the charity fundraiser, the nerds heavily outsell the Alpha Betas by offering pies with naked pictures of Betty and other Pi Delta Pis on the bottom. During this, Lewis, who has fallen in love with Betty, steals Stan's costume and tricks Betty into engaging in sexual intercourse with him, hooking up with her. She is surprised when Lewis reveals his identity, but she admits he was \\"wonderful\\" and is not angry. Finally, the nerds dominate the musical competition with a techno-computer- driven musical production, winning the overall games. Lewis immediately nominates Gilbert as the new Council president. Coach Harris lambastes the Alpha Betas for losing to the nerds, and Stan leads them in vandalizing the Tri-Lamb house. The nerds become despondent, and Gilbert decides to barge into the middle of the Homecoming Pep Rally to address his complaints. The Alpha Betas try to stop him, but Jefferson and a group of national Tri-Lambs arrive to intimidate the Alpha Betas, giving Gilbert the opportunity to give a rousing speech about standing up to discrimination. Lewis and the other Tri- Lambs, many alumni, and Betty, who announces she is \\"in love with a nerd\\", join in cheering Gilbert, soundly shaming the Alpha Betas. Dean Ulich instructs Coach Harris that the Tri-Lambs will now live in the Alpha Beta house, while the Alpha Betas will live in the gym until they can repair the Tri-Lamb house.

Exterior scenes such as the arrival of the nerds at college and the fraternity houses were filmed at the University of Arizona in Tucson, Arizona. The original Nerds residence, from which they were ousted by the Alpha Betas, was actually Cochise Hall. Their subsequent residence was U of A's Bear Down Gymnasium. The original Alpha Beta fraternity house that is burned down was filmed at the Beta Theta Pi fraternity house (on University Boulevard). The Pi Delta Pi sorority house was actually the Phi Delta Theta fraternity house. Soundtrack Ollie E. Brown, of Ollie & Jerry fame, wrote and performed the song \\"They're So Incredible\\" for the film, under the name Revenge. In the film, the song is performed by the Tri-Lambs at the final event of the Greek Games and contains different lyrics. Three songs appear in the film but do not appear on the soundtrack: \\"Burning Down the House\\" by Talking Heads, \\"Thriller\\" by Michael Jackson and \\"We Are the Champions\\" by Queen. Reception =Critical response= Revenge of the Nerds was panned by reviewers at release. Lawrence van Gelder for 'The New York Times wrote \\"It is the absence of genuine comedy that exposes glaringly the film's fundamental attitude of condescension and scorn toward blacks and women, and a tendency toward stereotyping that clashes violently with its superficial message of tolerance, compassion and fair play.\\" The Hollywood Reporter said \\"Revenge of the Nerds is primarily the story of outcasts getting their just rewards, and that is always a satisfying movie ingredient. Nonetheless, this scattergun, often scatological film is filled with extensive racial stereotypes, which may offend some moviegoers.\\" =Box office= Revenge of the Nerds was released in theaters on July 20, 1984. It grossed $40 million domestically. Home media The film was released on DVD on March 6, 2007, and on Blu-ray on May 6, 2014, by 20th Century Fox Home Entertainment. Legacy =Lasting reception= The film holds a 70% approval rating and 5.9/10 average at the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes based on 43 critics' reviews. The consensus is: \\"Undeniably lowbrow but surprisingly sly, Revenge of the Nerds has enough big laughs to qualify as a minor classic in the slobs-vs.-snobs subgenre.\\" It also holds a 44 out of 100 ratio on Metacritic based on six critics' reviews and signifying \\"mixed or average reviews\\". Revenge of the Nerds is #91 on Bravo's \\"100 Funniest Movies\\". About three decades after the film's release, commentators have looked back at the film and considered some of the scenes, particularly when Lewis pretends to be Stan and has a sexual encounter with Betty, to be rape by deception and a misogynistic remnant of a male-dominated culture of that time. William Bradley of The Mary Sue stated that after viewing the film again as an adult he \\"was immediately struck by the way the film plays sexual exploitation and assault for laughs\\". Amy Benfer of Salon wrote that the Revenge of the Nerds scene, and a similar scene in John Hughes' Sixteen Candles, were evidence that at the time of these films' productions, \\"people were stupid about date rape\\". In an interview with GQ in 2019, director Jeff Kanew and writer Steve Zacharias expressed their regret regarding the rape by deception scene, with Kanew saying, \\"In a way, it's not excusable. If it were my daughter, I probably wouldn't like it\\". =Fraternity= Due to the influence of the film, several chapters of Lambda Lambda Lambda have sprung up in different locations around the United States. The real life fraternity has six chapters in Connecticut, Maryland, New York, and Washington. =Sequels= Three less successful sequels followed; the last two were television films. * Revenge of the Nerds II: Nerds in Paradise (1987) * Revenge of the Nerds III: The Next Generation (1992) * Revenge of the Nerds IV: Nerds in Love (1994) =Planned remake= A remake of the original Revenge of the Nerds was slated for release in 2007, the first project for the newly created Fox Atomic, but was canceled in November 2006 after two weeks of filming. The cast included Adam Brody, Dan Byrd, Katie Cassidy, Kristin Cavallari, Jenna Dewan, Chris Marquette, Ryan Pinkston, Efren Ramirez, and Nick Zano. The film was to be directed by Kyle Newman, executive produced by McG, and written by Gabe Sachs and Jeff Judah, Adam Jay Epstein and Andrew Jacobson, and Adam F. Goldberg. Filming took place in Atlanta, Georgia at Agnes Scott College, the Georgia State Capitol, and Inman Park. Filming was originally scheduled to take place at Emory University, but university officials changed their minds after reading the script. The film was shelved after producers found the movie difficult to shoot on the smaller Agnes Scott campus and studio head Peter Rice was disappointed with the dailies. 20th Century Fox personnel have stated that it is highly unlikely that a remake will be picked up in the future. =Television= A pilot for a Revenge of the Nerds television series directed by Peter Baldwin was produced in 1991 but was never aired and was not picked up for a series. In the mid-2000s, Armstrong and Carradine had devised an idea for a reality television show based on nerds competing against each other in challenges, inspired by Revenge of the Nerds. However, the idea was rejected at the time, due to the competing Beauty and the Geek show. Six years later, Armstrong and Carradine shopped the idea around and were able to get the show greenlit on TBS in 2012. King of the Nerds ran for three seasons from 2013 to 2015, with Armstrong and Carradine hosting the program.

It is named after German chemist Gerhard Damk√∂hler. The Karlovitz number (Ka) is related to the Damk√∂hler number by Da = 1/Ka. In its most commonly used form, the Damk√∂hler number relates the reaction timescale to the convection time scale, volumetric flow rate, through the reactor for continuous (plug flow or stirred tank) or semibatch chemical processes: : \\\\mathrm{Da} = \\\\frac{ \\\\text{reaction rate} }{ \\\\text{convective mass transport rate} } In reacting systems that include interphase mass transport, the second Damk√∂hler number (DaII) is defined as the ratio of the chemical reaction rate to the mass transfer rate : \\\\mathrm{Da}_{\\\\mathrm{II}} = \\\\frac{ \\\\text{reaction rate} }{ \\\\text{diffusive mass transfer rate} } It is also defined as the ratio of the characteristic fluidic and chemical time scales: : \\\\mathrm{Da} = \\\\frac{ \\\\text{flow time scale} }{ \\\\text{chemical time scale} } Since the reaction timescale is determined by the reaction rate, the exact formula for the Damk√∂hler number varies according to the rate law equation. For a general chemical reaction A ‚Üí B of nth order, the Damk√∂hler number for a convective flow system is defined as: : \\\\mathrm{Da} = k C_0^{\\\\ n-1}\\\\tau where: * k = kinetics reaction rate constant * C0 = initial concentration * n = reaction order * \\\\tau = mean residence time or space time On the other hand, the second Damk√∂hler number is defined as: : \\\\mathrm{Da}_{\\\\mathrm{II}} = \\\\frac{k C_0^{n-1}}{k_g a} where * kg is the global mass transport coefficient * a is the interfacial area The value of Da provides a quick estimate of the degree of conversion that can be achieved. As a rule of thumb, when Da is less than 0.1 a conversion of less than 10% is achieved, and when Da is greater than 10 a conversion of more than 90% is expected. The limit \\\\mathrm{Da}\\\\rightarrow\\\\infty is called the Burke‚ÄìSchumann limit.

It is the time required for a slug of fluid to pass through the reactor. For a decomposition reaction, the rate of reaction is proportional to some power of the concentration of A .

It was founded by supporters of Ted Grant and Alan Woods after they were expelled from the Militant group in the early 1990s. Socialist Appeal is published fortnightly and describes its politics as descending from Karl Marx, Friedrich Engels, Vladimir Lenin and Leon Trotsky.  History  In the 1970s and 1980s, the Trotskyist Militant tendency had been a significant force within the British Labour Party. At the height of its influence in the mid-to-late 1980s, Militant had three Labour MPs, control of Liverpool City Council and later initiated the campaign they claim brought down the Poll tax. Grant had been one of the founders and the theoretical leader of the Militant group, but he was expelled with other supporters after the 1991 debate on the Open Turn. A special conference decision to endorse the Open Turn by 93% to 7% entailed Militant supporters abandoning the entryist strategy of working within the Labour Party and leaving to form an independent organisation. The new party was initially known as Militant Labour, changing its name in 1997 to the Socialist Party in England and Wales while in Scotland Scottish Militant Labour instigated the formation of the Scottish Socialist Party. The split was caused by the Militant tendency's majority adoption of the Open Turn, Grant's continued support for the tactic of entryism within the Labour Party and what Grant and Woods claimed was the bureaucratic centralist degeneration of Militant's internal regime. After the debate and conference decision, the Militant tendency claimed that Grant and Woods had begun a separate organisation and had split from Militant whilst Grant and Woods claimed to have been expelled. The Socialist Party drew the conclusions that owing to the policies followed by Labour under Neil Kinnock, it was effectively a bourgeois political party. Conversely, supporters of Socialist Appeal argued that the Labour Party was still based on trade unions and that the Labour Party retained support in the working class. As Labour under Tony Blair embraced the Third Way and moved away from its traditional socialist roots, most Trotskyist tendencies in Britain that employed the tactic of entrism left Labour and either run candidates under their own banner, such as the Socialist Party, or joined electoral coalitions such as the Scottish Socialist Party or the Socialist Alliance. The Socialist Party, along with other left-wing organisations, intiatiated the Campaign for a New Workers' Party in 2006, arguing that trade unions should break with Labour and construct their own political formation. However, supporters of Socialist Appeal have rejected this turn and they are the main Trotskyist group in Britain which maintains the entrist tactic in the 21st century (although the Alliance for Workers Liberty left and then rejoined). Socialist Appeal began publishing their own journal in 1992. In 2000, the group was estimated to have around 250 supporters.Peter Barberis et al, Encyclopedia of British and Irish Political Organizations, p.519 In 2013, the tendency in Britain made a turn towards the student movement by launching the Marxist Student Federation. Following the Scottish independence referendum in which Scots voted to retain the union with the rest of the United Kingdom, the International Marxist Tendency called for \\"the building of those forces on the left in Scotland, on a revolutionary and internationalist basis, beginning with the Scottish Socialist Party\\". In June 2015, Green Party of England and Wales deputy leader Shahrar Ali was a guest speaker at Socialist Appeal's Revolution 2015 summer school. In June 2017, Socialist Appeal editor Rob Sewell claimed that \\"the movement in the direction of revolution is being reflected on the political plane\\" in Britain and that \\"the events in Britain have a striking resemblance to the situation that existed in 1931, which Trotsky described as a pre-revolutionary situation\\".  Economy  Leading theoretician of the International Marxist Tendency Alan Woods in a meeting with Venezuelan president Hugo Ch√°vez Socialist Appeal is in broad agreement with the classical Marxist view that capitalism inherently results in \\"boom and bust\\" cycles as a result of overproduction and thus attempts to prevent this through monetarism or Keynesianism are not possible. Therefore, they believe the only solution to this is the introduction of democratic socialism, based on a planned and nationalised economy as well as on the socialisation of its \\"commanding heights\\" (i.e. the top 150‚Äì200 financial institutions and companies). They argue that a planned economy is able to replace production on the basis of profit with production on the basis of need.  Publications  The new Socialist Appeal masthead, adopted when the journal made the transition to newspaper format in 2009 Socialist Appeal refers to the fortnightly journal of the same name. In September 2009, the publication Socialist Appeal changed from a magazine journal format to a full colour tabloid. An issue of Socialist Appeal typically contains theoretical articles, industrial reports and political analysis. The group also produce and publish a number of pamphlets and books through their Wellred publishing arm. Socialist Appeal was also the name of two British Trotskyist newspapers associated with Ted Grant in the 1940s: one was the newspaper of the Workers International League and immediately following that of the Revolutionary Communist Party. It was also the name of the paper of the Trotskyist Workers Party of the United States during its period of entryism in the Socialist Party of America in 1936‚Äì1938. Socialist Appeal is the name of the English- language newspaper of the Workers' International League, the United States section of the International Marxist Tendency and a newspaper in New Zealand which is also affiliated.  International Marxist Tendency  Socialist Appeal is the British section of the International Marxist Tendency Although they remain small in Britain, the international group to which they are affiliated known as the International Marxist Tendency has grown in number especially in the Indian subcontinent, as well as Latin America where they rally support for the Bolivarian Revolution and instigated the formation of the Hands Off Venezuela campaign group. As well as publishing their paper Socialist Appeal, the group has also published a number of books by Trotsky, Grant and Woods. The group has devoted much of their time to developing the multilingual website In Defence of Marxism. Supporters of Socialist Appeal value the importance of theory highly and dedicate a large amount of space in their paper and website to theoretical articles. Socialist Appeal's editors argues that a thorough understanding of Marxism, history, economics and politics is necessary to understand the world today. They also argue that the neglect of theory in the late 1980s led to the Militant tendency turning in an ultraleft direction.

For a generic chemical reaction :‚àívA A + ‚àívB B + ... ‚Üí vP P + vQ Q ... the standard enthalpy of reaction ŒîHr‚¶µ is related to the standard enthalpy of formation ŒîHf‚¶µ of the reactants and products by the following equation neglecting the heat of mixing of reagents and products or assuming ideal solutions involved: : \\\\Delta H_\\\\mathrm{r}^\\\\ominus = \\\\sum_{B}{v_B\\\\Delta H_\\\\mathrm{f}^\\\\ominus(B)} In this equation, vB is the stoichiometric number of entity B. The standard enthalpy of formation, which has been determined for a vast number of substances, is the change of enthalpy during the formation of 1 mole of the substance from its constituent elements, with all substances in their standard states. The enthalpy change of any reaction under any conditions can be computed from the above equation, given the standard enthalpy of formation of the reactants and products. The enthalpy change is defined as the amount of heat absorbed or evolved in the transformation of the reactants at a given temperature and pressure into the products at the same temperature and pressure. Heat of reaction at constant pressure and at constant volume The heat of a reaction depends upon the conditions under which the reactions are carried out. There are two general conditions under which thermochemical measurements are made. : (a) Constant volume and temperature: heat Q_v = \\\\Delta E : (b) Constant pressure and temperature: heat Q_p = \\\\Delta H The magnitudes of the heat effects in these two conditions are different. In the first case the volume of the system is kept constant during the course of the measurement by carrying out the reaction in a closed and rigid container and as there is no change in the volume and so no work is also involved. From the first law of thermodynamics we have a relation, \\\\Delta E = Q_v That is, the heat of a reaction at constant volume is equal to the change in the internal energy (Œî E) of the reacting system. The thermal change that occurs in a chemical reaction is only due to the difference in the sum of internal energy of the products and the sum of the internal energy of reactants. : \\\\Delta E = \\\\sum E_{products} - \\\\sum E_{reactants} This also signifies that the amount of heat absorbed at constant volume could be identified with the change in the thermodynamic quantity internal energy. At constant pressure on the other hand, the system is either kept open to the atmosphere or confined within a container on which a constant external pressure is exerted and under these conditions the volume of the system changes. The thermal change at a constant pressure not only involves the change in the internal energy of the system but also the work performed either in expansion or contraction of the system. : Q_p = \\\\Delta E + W (work) If ‚ÄòW‚Äô is only pressure-volume work, then : Q_p = \\\\Delta H = \\\\Delta E + P \\\\Delta V : Q_p = \\\\left(\\\\sum E_p - \\\\sum E_r\\\\right) + P \\\\left( V_p - V_r \\\\right) : Q_p = \\\\left( \\\\sum E_p + P V_p \\\\right) - \\\\left( \\\\sum E_r + P V_r \\\\right) As enthalpy or heat content is defined by H = E + PV . So we have, Q_p = \\\\sum H_p - \\\\sum H_r = \\\\Delta H At constant pressure, the heat of the reaction is exactly equal to the enthalpy change, \\\\Delta H, of the reacting system.  Subcategories  In each case the word standard implies that all reactants and products are in their standard states. * Standard enthalpy of neutralization is the change in enthalpy that occurs when an acid and base undergo a neutralization reaction to form one mole of water. * Standard enthalpy of sublimation, or heat of sublimation, is defined as the enthalpy required to sublime one mole of the substance. * Standard enthalpy of solution (or enthalpy change of dissolution or heat of solution) is the enthalpy change associated with the dissolution of a substance in a solvent at constant pressure. * Standard enthalpy of hydrogenation is defined as the enthalpy change observed when one mole of an unsaturated compound reacts with an excess of hydrogen to become fully saturated.

Road signs in Stockport referring to the Trail. The Trans Pennine Trail is a long-distance path running from coast to coast across Northern England entirely on surfaced paths and using only gentle gradients (it runs largely along disused railway lines and canal towpaths). It forms part of European walking route E8 and is part of the National Cycle Network as Route 62 (referencing the M62 motorway which also crosses the Pennines). Most of the surfaces and gradients make it a relatively easy trail, suitable for cyclists, pushchairs and wheelchair users. The section between Stockport and Barnsley is hilly, especially near Woodhead, and not all sections or barriers are accessible for users of wheelchairs or non-standard cycles. Some parts are also open to horse riding. The trail is administered from a central office in Barnsley, which is responsible for promotion and allocation of funding. However, the twenty-seven local authorities whose areas the trail runs through are responsible for management of the trail within their boundaries.  History  The idea originated from Barnsley, where the head office is now based. Work on the trail started in 1999. Early development was boosted by a ¬£5 million investment by the Millennium Commission. The trail was officially opened in September 2001. However, the route was not fully completed until late 2004. It cost ¬£60 million to construct.  Route  The main west‚Äìeast trail starts at Southport, then heads south through the suburbs of Liverpool, through Widnes, Warrington, Manchester, Stockport and Hadfield. It then crosses the Peak District, heading up the Longdendale valley via the Longdendale Trail to Woodhead, then down through Dunford Bridge and Penistone, Doncaster, Selby, Hessle, Hull and Hornsea. This route covers . Between Southport and Selby it is National Cycle Network, Route 62 and from Selby to Hornsea, NCN Route 65. There is also a north‚Äìsouth trail that runs from Leeds and through Wakefield. It then passes through Barnsley and crosses over the main trail in the Dearne Valley area. After that it continues south to Sheffield and the Rother Valley Country Park before terminating in Chesterfield. This is NCN Route 67 and is long. The route also has several deviations and loops in South Yorkshire, including one to Rotherham, NCN Route 6 and NCN Route 627 south of Penistone. Another spur runs from Selby to York, NCN Route 65. The cross-continent European walking route E8 uses the trail between Hull and Liverpool to cross England. It also crosses both the eastern and western routes of the European walking route E2.

Second-order logic is in turn extended by higher-order logic and type theory. First-order logic quantifies only variables that range over individuals (elements of the domain of discourse); second-order logic, in addition, also quantifies over relations. For example, the second-order sentence \\\\forall P\\\\,\\\\forall x (Px \\\\lor eg Px) says that for every formula P, and every individual x, either Px is true or not(Px) is true (this is the principle of bivalence). Second-order logic also includes quantification over sets, functions, and other variables as explained in the section Syntax and fragments. Both first-order and second-order logic use the idea of a domain of discourse (often called simply the \\"domain\\" or the \\"universe\\"). The domain is a set over which individual elements may be quantified. Examples First- order logic can quantify over individuals, but not over properties. That is, we can take an atomic sentence like Cube(b) and obtain a quantified sentence by replacing the name with a variable and attaching a quantifier:Professor Marc Cohen lecture notes https://faculty.washington.edu/smcohen/120/SecondOrder.pdf ‚àÉx Cube(x) But we cannot do the same with the predicate. That is, the following expression: ‚àÉP P(b) is not a sentence of first-order logic. But this is a legitimate sentence of second-order logic. As a result, second-order logic has much more ‚Äúexpressive power‚Äù than FOL does. For example, there is no way in FOL to say that a and b have some property in common; but in second-order logic this would be expressed as ‚àÉP (P(a) ‚àß P(b)). Suppose we would like to say that a and b have the same shape. The best we could do in FOL is something like this: (Cube(a) ‚àß Cube(b)) ‚à® (Tet(a) ‚àß Tet(b)) ‚à® (Dodec(a) ‚àß Dodec(b)) If the only shapes are cube, tetrahedron, and dodecahedron, for a and b to have the same shape is for them either to be both cubes, both tetrahedra, or both dodecahedra. But this FOL sentence doesn‚Äôt seem to mean quite the same thing as the English sentence it is translating ‚Äî for example, it doesn‚Äôt say anything about the fact that it is shape that a and b have in common. In second-order logic, by contrast, we could add a predicate Shape that is true of precisely the properties corresponding to the predicates Cube, Tet, and Dodec. That is, Shape(Cube) ‚àß Shape(Tet) ‚àß Shape(Dodec) So we could write: ‚àÉP (Shape(P) ‚àß P(a) ‚àß P(b)) And this will come out true in exactly when a and b are either both cubes, both tetrahedra, or both dodecahedra. So in second- order logic we can express the idea of same shape using identity and the second-order predicate Shape; we can do without the special predicate SameShape. Similarly, we can express the claim that no object has every shape in a way that brings out the quantifier in every shape: ¬¨‚àÉx ‚àÄP(Shape(P) ‚Üí P(x)) In FOL a block is said to be one of the following: a cube, a tetrahedron, or a dodecahedron:Stapleton, G., Howse, J., & Lee, J. M., eds., Diagrammatic Representation and Inference: 5th International Conference, Diagrams 2008 (Berlin/Heidelberg: Springer, 2008), p. 258. ¬¨‚àÉx (Cube(x) ‚àß Tet(x) ‚àß Dodec(x)) Syntax and fragments The syntax of second-order logic tells which expressions are well formed formulas. In addition to the syntax of first-order logic, second-order logic includes many new sorts (sometimes called types) of variables. These are: * A sort of variables that range over sets of individuals. If S is a variable of this sort and t is a first-order term then the expression t ‚àà S (also written S(t), or St to save parentheses) is an atomic formula. Sets of individuals can also be viewed as unary relations on the domain. * For each natural number k there is a sort of variables that ranges over all k-ary relations on the individuals. If R is such a k-ary relation variable and t1,...,tk are first-order terms then the expression R(t1,...,tk) is an atomic formula. * For each natural number k there is a sort of variables that ranges over all functions taking k elements of the domain and returning a single element of the domain. If f is such a k-ary function variable and t1,...,tk are first-order terms then the expression f(t1,...,tk) is a first-order term. Each of the variables just defined may be universally and/or existentially quantified over, to build up formulas. Thus there are many kinds of quantifiers, two for each sort of variables. A sentence in second-order logic, as in first-order logic, is a well-formed formula with no free variables (of any sort). It's possible to forgo the introduction of function variables in the definition given above (and some authors do this) because an n-ary function variable can be represented by a relation variable of arity n+1 and an appropriate formula for the uniqueness of the \\"result\\" in the n+1 argument of the relation. (Shapiro 2000, p. 63) Monadic second-order logic (MSO) is a restriction of second-order logic in which only quantification over unary relations (i.e. sets) is allowed. Quantification over functions, owing to the equivalence to relations as described above, is thus also not allowed. The second-order logic without these restrictions is sometimes called full second-order logic to distinguish it from the monadic version. Monadic second-order logic is particularly used in the context of Courcelle's theorem, an algorithmic meta-theorem in graph theory. Just as in first-order logic, second-order logic may include non- logical symbols in a particular second-order language. These are restricted, however, in that all terms that they form must be either first-order terms (which can be substituted for a first-order variable) or second-order terms (which can be substituted for a second-order variable of an appropriate sort). A formula in second-order logic is said to be of first-order (and sometimes denoted \\\\Sigma^1_0 or \\\\Pi^1_0) if its quantifiers (which may be of either type) range only over variables of first order, although it may have free variables of second order. A \\\\Sigma^1_1 (existential second-order) formula is one additionally having some existential quantifiers over second order variables, i.e. \\\\exists R_0\\\\ldots\\\\exists R_m \\\\phi, where \\\\phi is a first-order formula. The fragment of second order logic consisting only of existential second-order formulas is called existential second-order logic and abbreviated as ESO, as \\\\Sigma^1_1, or even as ‚àÉSO. The fragment of \\\\Pi^1_1 formulas is defined dually, it is called universal second-order logic. More expressive fragments are defined for any k > 0 by mutual recursion: \\\\Sigma^1_{k+1} has the form \\\\exists R_0\\\\ldots\\\\exists R_m \\\\phi, where \\\\phi is a \\\\Pi^1_k formula, and similar, \\\\Pi^1_{k+1} has the form \\\\forall R_0\\\\ldots\\\\forall R_m \\\\phi, where \\\\phi is a \\\\Sigma^1_k formula. (See analytical hierarchy for the analogous construction of second-order arithmetic.) Semantics The semantics of second-order logic establish the meaning of each sentence. Unlike first-order logic, which has only one standard semantics, there are two different semantics that are commonly used for second-order logic: standard semantics and Henkin semantics. In each of these semantics, the interpretations of the first-order quantifiers and the logical connectives are the same as in first- order logic. Only the ranges of quantifiers over second-order variables differ in the two types of semantics (V√§√§n√§nen 2001). In standard semantics, also called full semantics, the quantifiers range over all sets or functions of the appropriate sort. Thus once the domain of the first-order variables is established, the meaning of the remaining quantifiers is fixed. It is these semantics that give second-order logic its expressive power, and they will be assumed for the remainder of this article. In Henkin semantics, each sort of second-order variable has a particular domain of its own to range over, which may be a proper subset of all sets or functions of that sort. Leon Henkin (1950) defined these semantics and proved that G√∂del's completeness theorem and compactness theorem, which hold for first-order logic, carry over to second-order logic with Henkin semantics. This is because Henkin semantics are almost identical to many-sorted first-order semantics, where additional sorts of variables are added to simulate the new variables of second-order logic. Second-order logic with Henkin semantics is not more expressive than first- order logic. Henkin semantics are commonly used in the study of second-order arithmetic. Jouko V√§√§n√§nen (2001) argued that the choice between Henkin models and full models for second-order logic is analogous to the choice between ZFC and V as a basis for set theory: \\"As with second-order logic, we cannot really choose whether we axiomatize mathematics using V or ZFC. The result is the same in both cases, as ZFC is the best attempt so far to use V as an axiomatization of mathematics.\\" Expressive power Second-order logic is more expressive than first-order logic. For example, if the domain is the set of all real numbers, one can assert in first-order logic the existence of an additive inverse of each real number by writing ‚àÄx ‚àÉy (x + y = 0) but one needs second-order logic to assert the least-upper-bound property for sets of real numbers, which states that every bounded, nonempty set of real numbers has a supremum. If the domain is the set of all real numbers, the following second-order sentence (split over two lines) expresses the least upper bound property: : (‚àÄ A) ([ ‚àß ] ::-> ) This formula is a direct formalization of \\"every , set A .\\" It can be shown that any ordered field that satisfies this property is isomorphic to the real number field. On the other hand, the set of first-order sentences valid in the reals has arbitrarily large models due to the compactness theorem. Thus the least-upper-bound property cannot be expressed by any set of sentences in first-order logic. (In fact, every real- closed field satisfies the same first-order sentences in the signature \\\\langle +,\\\\cdot,\\\\le\\\\rangle as the real numbers.) In second-order logic, it is possible to write formal sentences which say \\"the domain is finite\\" or \\"the domain is of countable cardinality.\\" To say that the domain is finite, use the sentence that says that every surjective function from the domain to itself is injective. To say that the domain has countable cardinality, use the sentence that says that there is a bijection between every two infinite subsets of the domain. It follows from the compactness theorem and the upward L√∂wenheim‚ÄìSkolem theorem that it is not possible to characterize finiteness or countability, respectively, in first-order logic. Certain fragments of second order logic like ESO are also more expressive than first-order logic even though they are strictly less expressive than the full second-order logic. ESO also enjoys translation equivalence with some extensions of first-order logic which allow non-linear ordering of quantifier dependencies, like first-order logic extended with Henkin quantifiers, Hintikka and Sandu's independence- friendly logic, and V√§√§n√§nen's dependence logic. Deductive systems A deductive system for a logic is a set of inference rules and logical axioms that determine which sequences of formulas constitute valid proofs. Several deductive systems can be used for second-order logic, although none can be complete for the standard semantics (see below). Each of these systems is sound, which means any sentence they can be used to prove is logically valid in the appropriate semantics. The weakest deductive system that can be used consists of a standard deductive system for first-order logic (such as natural deduction) augmented with substitution rules for second-order terms.Such a system is used without comment by Hinman (2005). This deductive system is commonly used in the study of second-order arithmetic. The deductive systems considered by Shapiro (1991) and Henkin (1950) add to the augmented first- order deductive scheme both comprehension axioms and choice axioms. These axioms are sound for standard second-order semantics. They are sound for Henkin semantics restricted to Henkin models satisfying the comprehension and choice axioms.These are the models originally studied by Henkin (1950). Non- reducibility to first-order logic One might attempt to reduce the second- order theory of the real numbers, with full second-order semantics, to the first-order theory in the following way. First expand the domain from the set of all real numbers to a two-sorted domain, with the second sort containing all sets of real numbers. Add a new binary predicate to the language: the membership relation. Then sentences that were second-order become first-order, with the formerly second-order quantifiers ranging over the second sort instead. This reduction can be attempted in a one-sorted theory by adding unary predicates that tell whether an element is a number or a set, and taking the domain to be the union of the set of real numbers and the power set of the real numbers. But notice that the domain was asserted to include all sets of real numbers. That requirement cannot be reduced to a first-order sentence, as the L√∂wenheim‚ÄìSkolem theorem shows. That theorem implies that there is some countably infinite subset of the real numbers, whose members we will call internal numbers, and some countably infinite collection of sets of internal numbers, whose members we will call \\"internal sets\\", such that the domain consisting of internal numbers and internal sets satisfies exactly the same first-order sentences as are satisfied by the domain of real numbers and sets of real numbers. In particular, it satisfies a sort of least-upper-bound axiom that says, in effect: :Every nonempty internal set that has an internal upper bound has a least internal upper bound. Countability of the set of all internal numbers (in conjunction with the fact that those form a densely ordered set) implies that that set does not satisfy the full least-upper-bound axiom. Countability of the set of all internal sets implies that it is not the set of all subsets of the set of all internal numbers (since Cantor's theorem implies that the set of all subsets of a countably infinite set is an uncountably infinite set). This construction is closely related to Skolem's paradox. Thus the first-order theory of real numbers and sets of real numbers has many models, some of which are countable. The second-order theory of the real numbers has only one model, however. This follows from the classical theorem that there is only one Archimedean complete ordered field, along with the fact that all the axioms of an Archimedean complete ordered field are expressible in second-order logic. This shows that the second-order theory of the real numbers cannot be reduced to a first-order theory, in the sense that the second-order theory of the real numbers has only one model but the corresponding first-order theory has many models. There are more extreme examples showing that second-order logic with standard semantics is more expressive than first-order logic. There is a finite second-order theory whose only model is the real numbers if the continuum hypothesis holds and which has no model if the continuum hypothesis does not hold (cf. Shapiro 2000, p. 105). This theory consists of a finite theory characterizing the real numbers as a complete Archimedean ordered field plus an axiom saying that the domain is of the first uncountable cardinality. This example illustrates that the question of whether a sentence in second-order logic is consistent is extremely subtle. Additional limitations of second order logic are described in the next section. Metalogical results It is a corollary of G√∂del's incompleteness theorem that there is no deductive system (that is, no notion of provability) for second-order formulas that simultaneously satisfies these three desired attributes:The proof of this corollary is that a sound, complete, and effective deduction system for standard semantics could be used to produce a recursively enumerable completion of Peano arithmetic, which G√∂del's theorem shows cannot exist. * (Soundness) Every provable second-order sentence is universally valid, i.e., true in all domains under standard semantics. * (Completeness) Every universally valid second-order formula, under standard semantics, is provable. * (Effectiveness) There is a proof-checking algorithm that can correctly decide whether a given sequence of symbols is a proof or not. This corollary is sometimes expressed by saying that second-order logic does not admit a complete proof theory. In this respect second-order logic with standard semantics differs from first-order logic; Quine (1970, pp. 90‚Äì91) pointed to the lack of a complete proof system as a reason for thinking of second-order logic as not logic, properly speaking. As mentioned above, Henkin proved that the standard deductive system for first-order logic is sound, complete, and effective for second-order logic with Henkin semantics, and the deductive system with comprehension and choice principles is sound, complete, and effective for Henkin semantics using only models that satisfy these principles. The compactness theorem and the L√∂wenheim‚ÄìSkolem theorem do not hold for full models of second-order logic. They do hold however for Henkin models.Manzano, M., Model Theory, trans. Ruy J. G. B. de Queiroz (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1999), p. xi. History and disputed value Predicate logic was introduced to the mathematical community by C. S. Peirce, who coined the term second-order logic and whose notation is most similar to the modern form (Putnam 1982). However, today most students of logic are more familiar with the works of Frege, who published his work several years prior to Peirce but whose works remained less known until Bertrand Russell and Alfred North Whitehead made them famous. Frege used different variables to distinguish quantification over objects from quantification over properties and sets; but he did not see himself as doing two different kinds of logic. After the discovery of Russell's paradox it was realized that something was wrong with his system. Eventually logicians found that restricting Frege's logic in various ways‚Äîto what is now called first-order logic‚Äîeliminated this problem: sets and properties cannot be quantified over in first-order-logic alone. The now-standard hierarchy of orders of logics dates from this time. It was found that set theory could be formulated as an axiomatized system within the apparatus of first-order logic (at the cost of several kinds of completeness, but nothing so bad as Russell's paradox), and this was done (see Zermelo‚ÄìFraenkel set theory), as sets are vital for mathematics. Arithmetic, mereology, and a variety of other powerful logical theories could be formulated axiomatically without appeal to any more logical apparatus than first-order quantification, and this, along with G√∂del and Skolem's adherence to first-order logic, led to a general decline in work in second (or any higher) order logic. This rejection was actively advanced by some logicians, most notably W. V. Quine. Quine advanced the view that in predicate-language sentences like Fx the \\"x\\" is to be thought of as a variable or name denoting an object and hence can be quantified over, as in \\"For all things, it is the case that . . .\\" but the \\"F\\" is to be thought of as an abbreviation for an incomplete sentence, not the name of an object (not even of an abstract object like a property). For example, it might mean \\" . . . is a dog.\\" But it makes no sense to think we can quantify over something like this. (Such a position is quite consistent with Frege's own arguments on the concept-object distinction). So to use a predicate as a variable is to have it occupy the place of a name which only individual variables should occupy. This reasoning has been rejected by George Boolos. In recent years second-order logic has made something of a recovery, buoyed by Boolos' interpretation of second-order quantification as plural quantification over the same domain of objects as first-order quantification (Boolos 1984). Boolos furthermore points to the claimed nonfirstorderizability of sentences such as \\"Some critics admire only each other\\" and \\"Some of Fianchetto's men went into the warehouse unaccompanied by anyone else\\", which he argues can only be expressed by the full force of second-order quantification. However, generalized quantification and partially ordered, or branching, quantification may suffice to express a certain class of purportedly nonfirstorderizable sentences as well and it does not appeal to second-order quantification.  Relation to computational complexity The expressive power of various forms of second-order logic on finite structures is intimately tied to computational complexity theory. The field of descriptive complexity studies which computational complexity classes can be characterized by the power of the logic needed to express languages (sets of finite strings) in them. A string w = w1¬∑¬∑¬∑wn in a finite alphabet A can be represented by a finite structure with domain D = {1,...,n}, unary predicates Pa for each a ‚àà A, satisfied by those indices i such that wi = a, and additional predicates which serve to uniquely identify which index is which (typically, one takes the graph of the successor function on D or the order relation <, possibly with other arithmetic predicates). Conversely, the table of any finite structure can be encoded by a finite string. This identification leads to the following characterizations of variants of second- order logic over finite structures: * REG (the set of regular languages) is definable by monadic, second-order formulas (B√ºchi's theorem, 1960) * NP is the set of languages definable by existential, second-order formulas (Fagin's theorem, 1974). * co-NP is the set of languages definable by universal, second-order formulas. * PH is the set of languages definable by second-order formulas. * PSPACE is the set of languages definable by second-order formulas with an added transitive closure operator. * EXPTIME is the set of languages definable by second-order formulas with an added least fixed point operator. Relationships among these classes directly impact the relative expressiveness of the logics over finite structures; for example, if PH = PSPACE, then adding a transitive closure operator to second-order logic would not make it any more expressive over finite structures.

Miscellany The community has an annual festival called Crackaway Daze which is held on the third full weekend of September. There is also an annual Volunteer Fireman's Picnic held at the firestation to raise money for funding for the fire department, including food, games, a dunk tank, and raffle. There once was a school where the park is currently located. This school was no longer used after the consolidation of community schools into a larger county school corporation (North and South Decatur Schools). The park is now used for the Crackaway Daze festival, local events, and little league. New Point, like the rest of Decatur County, has seen a lot of economic development in recent years. Many small businesses and housing developments have appeared, changing the cultural landscape of the small village. A recently added mobile home park has increased the population, but has also led to an influx of new residents. The town government seems to be fairly active, but has also led to controversy amongst the citizens of New Point. Just across Highway 46, there is a convenience store called Day and Night. This store was once locally owned, but has since come under new ownership, which has since become a BP franchise. A motel is also open next door from BP called Motel 46. North of this there is a truck stop. This truck stop is owned by the G & G Oil corporation of Muncie, Indiana, who have made it part of the \\"Petro\\" franchise. This truck stop has a reputation for being a mom-and-pop truck stop. The truck stop was under the management of Robert and LaVonne \\"Bonnie\\" Morton, of New Point, for the longest time, thus giving it the name Bob's Truck Stop. Bob was in charge of the trucking aspect; service, managing, as well as towing. Bonnie managed the restaurant and its many employees over the years. It is currently managed by Gary Copeland, who is also active in local radio and business. The truck stop features a travel store, restaurant, shower and laundry facilities, and a tiny arcade. There is also a service center for commercial trucks.

It was introduced in October 1938 and remained in production until 1941. Returning to the market in 1945, it was offered until 1961. The car progressed in 1953 from its original perpendicular or \\"sit-up- and-beg\\" style to a more modern three-box structure. Some versions were also built and sold by Ford Australia. Like its siblings, the car became a popular basis for a hot rod, especially in Britain, where its lightweight structure and four-cylinder engines appealed to builders. __TOC__  E93A (1938‚Äì49) The Ford Prefect was introduced in October 1938 and built by the Ford plant in Dagenham, Essex. The original Ford Prefect was a slight reworking of the previous year's 7W, the first Ford car designed outside of Detroit, Michigan. It was designed specifically for the British market. It had a side-valve engine with thermocirculation radiator (no pump) and the ability to be started by a crank handle, should the battery not have sufficient power to turn the starter motor, running from the six-Volt charging system. The windscreen wipers were powered by the vacuum ported from the engine intake manifold ‚Äî as the car laboured uphill the wipers would slow to a standstill due to the intake manifold vacuum dropping to near nil, only to start working again as the top was reached and the intake vacuum increased. The windscreen opened forward pivoting on hinges on the top edge; two flaps either side of the scuttle also let air into the car. The car has a durable four-cylinder motor. The most common body styles were two- and four-door saloons, but pre-war a few tourers and drophead coup√©s were made. Post-war, only four-door saloons were available on the home market, but two-door models were made for export. 41,486 were made up to 1941 and a further 158,007 between 1945 and 1948. File:Ford Prefect tourer 1939 Woodhorn 2013 crop.jpg1939 Ford Prefect E93A Tourer =Australian production= The E93A was also produced in Australia with the Australian-built four-door saloon having an all-steel roof. Two-door saloon,Bill Ballard, Small Fords English and Australian : Recognition and Restoration, 2003, pages 133-134 tourer, 5cwt panel van, coup√© utility and roadster utility models were also produced. In late 1939 the Australian Prefect models were recoded to E03A. E03A (Australia: 1939‚Äì45) The E03A replaced the E93A in Australian production in 1939. The E03A saloon differed from the English E93A saloon in having an all-steel roof and stainless steel waistline trim. A53A (Australia: 1946-48) The A53A replaced the E03A in Australian production in 1946 with 4-door saloon, coup√© utility and 5cwt delivery van versions produced. The A53A saloon differed from the E03A saloon in having an extended boot. From October 1947 the grille slates were chrome- plated. E493A (1949‚Äì53) Post war, the Prefect design changed little until replaced in 1952. The headlamps moved into the wings and trafficators were fitted (internally lit semaphores springing out from the door pillars to signal left and right turns), though due to space restrictions these were left out on the Australian-built Ute. Only four-door saloons were available on the home market, the two-door sector being left to the Anglia but some were made for export. The brakes remained mechanically operated using the Girling rod system with drums and the chassis still had transverse leaf springs front and rear. A Prefect tested by the British magazine The Motor in 1948 had a top speed of and could accelerate from 0- in 22.8 seconds. A fuel consumption of was recorded. The test car which had the optional leather upholstery cost ¬£412 including taxes. In standard form, they commented that it was the cheapest 4-door car on the British market. 192,229 were made. Rear Canadian-market 1950 Prefect A493A (Australia: 1949-1953) The A493A was an Australian produced variant of the English E493A which was offered in 4-door saloon and coupe utility variants. The A493A saloon differs from the E493A saloon in having a solid roof, an extended boot and a swage line on the front doors. File:Ford Prefect (A493A).JPGFord Prefect A493A Saloon. This image shows the solid roof, extended boot and swage line on the front doors. File:Ford Prefect Coupe Utility (A493A).jpgFord Prefect Coupe Utility (A493A) 100E (1953‚Äì59) In 1953 a much redesigned Ford Prefect was introduced alongside the similar Ford Anglia and remained in production until 1959. Externally, the Prefect can be distinguished from the Anglia by having vertical bars on the radiator grille and four doors. The old separate chassis had gone, replaced by integral construction, and coil independent front suspension supplanted the transverse leaf spring. Girling hydraulic brakes were fitted, initially 7 in drums but quickly increased to A new side-valve engine of 1172 cc engine was fitted having the same bore, stroke and layout of the previous engine, but in all other respects completely different - changes included adjustable tappets, raising the compression ratio from 6.3:1 to 7:1 and larger inlet valves, resulting in the power output increasing by 20% to 36 bhp. Inside there were separate front seats trimmed in PVC with leather as an option and two circular instruments in front of the driver one containing the speedometer and the other, fuel and water temperature gauges. De Luxe models from the second dashboard update in 1959 included glove box locks. The gear change was floor- mounted. The heater was an optional extra. The windscreen wipers were powered by the inlet manifold vacuum; when the engine was working hard, the vacuum fell away and the wipers slowed or stopped. The dashboard was revised twice; the binnacle surrounding the steering column was replaced by a central panel with twin dials towards the driver's side in 1956; the last from 1959 had twin dials in a binnacle in front of the driver and 'magic ribbon' AC speedo similar to the 1957 E-series Vauxhall Velox/Cresta and '58/'59 PA models. In 1955 an estate car version was introduced, marketed as the Ford Squire and mechanically identical to the contemporary Escort, an estate car version of the Ford Anglia 100E, but with wooden strakes and a higher trim level. The Motor magazine tested a de-luxe 100E in 1957 and recorded a top speed of and acceleration from 0- in 32.2 seconds. A \\"touring\\" fuel consumption of 33.1 miles per gallon (imperial) was recorded. On the home market it cost ¬£658 including taxes of ¬£220. 100,554 were made. 275x275px 107E (1959‚Äì61) The Prefect 107E utilized a reworked 100E body with the then-new overhead valve engine, four-speed gearbox and 'banjo' style rear end from the Anglia 105E, produced to offer a four-door model until replaced by the Ford Consul Classic. 38,154 were made, most of them in a two-tone colour scheme and deluxe trim. Versions assembled in New Zealand had a rare 'factory fitted' heater (dealer fit was almost universal at the time) and plush carpet. Drum brakes of diameter were fitted, hydraulically operated, and the suspension was independent at the front using MacPherson struts. The rear driven axle used semi elliptic leaf springs. The steering mechanism used a worm and peg system. On test, The Motor magazine recorded a top speed of and acceleration from 0- in 27.2 seconds. A \\"touring\\" fuel consumption of 36 miles per gallon (imperial) was recorded. On the home market, it cost ¬£621, including taxes of ¬£183. Optional extras included a heater, windscreen washers, radio and leather upholstery to replace the standard PVC.  Exports and foreign production  In addition to the United Kingdom and Australia, Ford Prefects were also sold in the US, New Zealand (where they were locally assembled), Argentina and Canada. The Canadian model was left-hand drive. The Prefect was also license- built in Latvia by Ford-Vairogs as the Ford-Vairogs Junior. In Ireland, the Prefect was assembled at the Ford Cork plant until 1962. In South Africa, they were assembled locally at the Ford Struandale plant in Port Elizabeth. Singapore-based Ford of Malaya had also built the Prefect 100E with imported CKD kits.

Founded as a town in 1793, it immediately developed itself into one of the first important and influential early British Upper Canada communities established during the late 18th century eventually amalgamating with the city of Hamilton in 2001. By 1823, due in large part to its easily accessible water power and location at the juncture of prehistoric indigenous trading routes, Ancaster had become Upper Canada's largest industrial and commercial centre. Additionally, Ancaster had at that time attracted the 2nd largest populace (1,681) in Upper Canada trailing only Kingston (population 2,500), but surpassing the populations of nearby Toronto (1,376) and Hamilton (1,000).ANCASTER The Past, Present and Future, A Brief prepared by The Ancaster Township Historical Society 1972 After this initial period of prosperity beginning in the late 18th century, sudden significant water and rail transportation advancements of the early 19th century would soon better benefit Ancaster's neighbouring towns situated closer to the Lake Ontario waterfront. Stationary steam engines for industries that had rapidly developed in the 19th century would eventually make Ancaster's water powered industries less vital. As a result, after the 1820s, Ancaster's influence during the remainder of the 19th century would begin to wane. From the late 19th century, Ancaster's population would remain static until 1946 when new subdivisions around the village were established. The population expanded further with the completion of the Hamilton-Ancaster section of Highway 403 in 1968 and the introduction of sewer systems in 1974. After 1970, its population essentially doubled from 15,000 residents to its present-day 33,000. Geography, economy and population Ancaster's geography has had a very significant effect on human settlement patterns throughout its prehistory and in the present day. A highly influential geographical formation has been the Niagara Escarpment consisting primarily of limestone formed from ancient fossilized sea organisms that spans from present day New York State through Ontario to Illinois. The escarpment itself created the water power that encouraged early European settlers to gravitate to the area in the late 1700s. However, this energy source would not have been accessible if the escarpment were not navigable. This long-meandering landform generally proved to be an inhospitable transportation barrier for thousands of years for past indigenous cultures. However, a natural break in this escarpment in the precise area that would become Ancaster village had for millennia created an opportunity for people to traverse up and down the escarpment providing a relatively easy navigable land transportation gateway from the head of the lake to the surrounding land on the escarpment and vice versa.Ancaster, A Glimpse into the Past, Ancaster Information Centre and Community Services. Andrew J.L. Barton, 1993 Ancaster Village circa 1927-32 Ancaster is the most westerly portion of the Golden Horseshoe conurbation of southern Ontario. It is generally considered to be an affluent bedroom community whose residents are typically professionals who work in downtown Hamilton, Brantford, Burlington, Oakville, Mississauga or Toronto. The former municipality had a population of 33,232 in the 2006 census, a considerable increase from the 2001 census figure of 27,485. Development in Olde Ancaster, the historic village core, has been tightly controlled. Its current population growth and building boom occurs mainly on the east side of Highway 403 in such typically suburban commercial developments as the Power Centre and residential developments such as the Meadowlands. It has resided in the 905 area code since the latter's creation, and its telephone exchange prefixes are 648 and 304, majority being 648. History The creation of the Upper and Lower Canadian provinces (colonies) from the division of the Province of Quebec (1763‚Äì1791) colony by the Parliament of Great Britain's Constitutional Act of 1791 had a deciding influence on the timing of the founding of Ancaster. At its inception, Upper Canada was only sparsely settled (unlike the more established Lower Canada) and its land had not been officially surveyed to any great extent. Thus, there was an urgency by the then Lieutenant Governor of Upper Canada John Graves Simcoe to survey this new and relatively barren province for establishing military roads and for preventing settlers from clearing and settling land not legally belonging to them. Predating Upper Canada, however, the earliest European settlers to arrive and clear land in the mid-18th century in what would eventually become Ancaster were mostly a wilderness society made up of American farmers travelling north searching for arable land and to a lesser extent French-speaking fur traders and British immigrants travelling southward. Also arriving into this area again travelling north in substantial numbers around 1787 with the incentive of inexpensive land grants were the United Empire Loyalists still loyal to the British crown who were fleeing from the United States after the 1776 American War of Independence. Britain's promise of free land brought many people from the new republic to the south and east, who did not exhibit the same loyalty to the crown as the Loyalists. This would eventually lead to a series of defections, accusations and treasonous acts during the War of 1812 that precipitated the largest mass hangings in Canadian history, the so-called Bloody Assizes whose trial took place in Ancaster in 1814. When Upper Canada was invaded by the United States during the War of 1812 its occupants were primarily of American ancestry. However, after the war the province would have a noticeably more British- centered influence. Britain expected its colonies to purchase all essential finished goods needed for day-to-day living from the mother country in exchange for raw materials such as fur and lumber. However, this 'arrangement' naturally proved to be very inefficient and impractical in practice so waterwheels, mills and factories soon hurriedly evolved in favourable towns in Upper Canada that had abundant water power, fertile soil, and good transportation access such as Ancaster that could then provide the new settlers with a good measure of self-sufficiency.A History of the Canadian People, WM. Stewart Wallace, The Copp Clark Company, Limited, Toronto: 1930 In an age before steam power, the wilderness that would become Ancaster had an early economic advantage because it existed amidst a natural break in the Niagara Escarpment. Thus even its relatively minor water resources were valuable because they were easily accessible. Just as vital an influence in Ancaster's rapid development was that it already had access to two very important prehistoric First Nations roads. The first European settlers to set foot in this region would have encountered the Iroquois Trail and the Mohawk Trail intersecting precisely in the area that would eventually become Ancaster Village. This aboriginal Iroquois trail had become the most important transportation route in Upper Canada. It meandered down the escarpment from the future Ancaster into what would eventually become Hamilton, Ontario, towards present day Lewiston, New York, eventually linking up with similar aboriginal trails in New York. In the other direction the Iroquois trail led from present-day Ancaster to what would eventually become the town of Brantford, Ontario, whereupon the trail then branched off into the Detroit Path and the Long Point trail. By 1770, the 80-kilometre Mohawk Trail was essentially the escarpment accompaniment of the lakeside Iroquois trail. The Mohawk Trail ran parallel to the Iroquois trail and originated and diverged from the Iroquois trail in present-day Queenston, Ontario, until finally ending and reconnecting to the Iroquois Trail in present-day Ancaster at what is now known as the intersection of Rousseaux and Wilson Street. The two trails interconnected in four locations along the Mohawk Trail's 80-kilometre route when favourable escarpment conditions permitted. By 1785, the Iroquois Trail passing through present day Ancaster had been widened to accommodate horse and buggy traffic. Another influential road that intersected the Mohawk Trail very close to Ancaster Village was the Twenty Mile road that followed the Twenty Mile Creek up to present day Smithville, Ontario, and beyond.The Origin And Development Of The Road Network Of The Niagara Peninsula, Ontario, 1770-1851. Andrew F. Burghardt McMaster University, Hamilton, Ontario Lastly, Ancaster also had fertile soil and abundant fresh water which encouraged pioneer settlers to arrive in this region to clear the land and plant crops for subsistence agriculture. Ancaster, 1910 Ancaster was established formally in 1792, but the area now referred to as Ancaster Village had been referred to informally by local villagers by the more colourful name of Wilson's Mills. This was in reference to millwright James Wilson who, along with his affluent fur trader, entrepreneur and business partner Richard Beasley, were the primary founders of Ancaster village. With Beasley's financial backing, Wilson built a gristmill in 1791 and a sawmill in 1792 that would be the only mills west of Grimsby for many years. In order to attract workers to his mills, Wilson needed to provide the social amenities and commercial framework for an area of land which in that period was an isolated frontier forest with accessible water power situated precisely at the juncture of already well- established pre-historical indigenous transportation trails. In that period the area was populated with just a smattering of First Nations aboriginal peoples and wilderness farmers. Again, with Beasley's financial assistance, Wilson managed to generate the impetus for a community by constructing a general store, a blacksmith shop, a distillery and a tavern all within walking distance of his mills. As a result, Wilson's newly arrived employees began to build their homes in close proximity to their place of work. and thus the necessary factors were in place for the community of Wilson's Mills to thrive. Wilson's primary residence was also used as a school, a magistrate's court and a cooperage.Ancaster, A Glimpse into the Past ‚Äî Ancaster Information Centre and Community Services 1993, Andrew J.L. Barton To this day, the main street that winds through the historical Ancaster Village that once was a section of the original aboriginal Iroquois Trail still bears the legacy of Wilson's name. By 1793 an area of land that contained Wilson's Mills was finally surveyed and officially came to be known as Ancaster Township as chosen by John Graves Simcoe. Simcoe was apparently inspired in the name choice by Peregrine Bertie, the 3rd Duke of Ancaster and Kesteven. Thus, Wilson's Mills was indirectly renamed Ancaster after the historic village in the county of Lincolnshire, England. In 1794, Wilson sold his half share of the grist-mill and sawmill business to Montreal-born fur trader, interpreter, businessman, militia officer and office holder Jean Rousseaux 'St. John' who already had a home and general store on Wilson Street. Rousseaux's Ancaster general store experienced frequent trading with Joseph Brant's Mohawks and other Iroquois people from the Six Nations confederacy located at the Grand River. Rousseaux would eventually buy out Beasley's remaining share of the mills in 1797. Rousseaux had also been Governor Simcoe's official native and French interpreter and was also a close confidante and advisor to native leader Joseph Brant. James Wilson at this point moved away and the local villagers by 1795 gradually began referring to the community of Wilson's Mills as Ancaster Village. Curiously, the detailed whereabouts or activities of James Wilson after his departure are not well documented. There is evidence that Wilson was born before 1755, had a wife and three children but his burial location is unknown.Ancaster's Heritage - A History of Ancaster Township - Published by the Ancaster Historical Society 1973 Page 13 - referenced from http://www.ourroots.ca/ With the profits from this business transaction Rousseaux built the Union Hotel in 1797 on Wilson Street, which is now remembered as the location of the Bloody Assize trials in 1814 during the War of 1812. By building his hotel on Wilson Street, Rousseaux reversed the then trend of building exclusively on the Mohawk trail.Ancaster's Heritage - A History of Ancaster Township - Published by the Ancaster Historical Society 1973 Page 30 - referenced from http://www.ourroots.ca/ In 1794-1797, Rousseaux also added a general store, brewery and distillery as well as hiring Ancaster's first school teacher. His other accomplishments being the first assessor, tax collector, magistrate and the Township's first Lieutenant Colonel of Militia. Rousseaux also became a considerable land owner and assisted significantly with native relations, was able to bridge French and English cultures successfully and was instrumental in the early development of Ancaster and old York. Rousseaux eventually resold the mills to the Union Mill Company in 1802 and they ultimately were destroyed by fire in 1812. However the mills brief 20 years of service (1791-1812) had provided the initial catalyst for the economic and social development of Ancaster Township. Rousseaux died of pleurisy at Fort George (Niagara-on-the-Lake) during the War of 1812. In 1798, the Hatt brothers Richard and Samuel from Dundas established their Red Mill downstream below Ancaster Falls at the base of the so-called \\"devil's elbow\\". They also widened the original native trail into what would be eventually known as the Old Ancaster-Dundas Road in order to provide better commercial access. In 1799, William Vanderlip built a hotel that in 1844 was sold to Adam Duff which gave birth to the nickname 'Duff's Corners' for describing the well-known intersection on Highway 53. By 1800, native mail couriers had been established between Montreal and Detroit with Ancaster appointed as the branching point for Queenston. In 1805, the Hatt brothers bought a majority of the village site from James Wilson and proceeded to subdivide it into streets and building lots. By 1810 the population of Ancaster had steadily risen to 400 residents yet in just 7 years by 1817 its populace would more than double to 1,037. In that same year Robert Gourlay carefully documented that Ancaster had 162 houses, 4 gristmills, 5 sawmills, 1 carding machine, 1 fulling mill, 5 doctors, 1 Episcopalian minister, and 1 Methodist meeting house. In 1820, Job Lodor acquired the Union Mill Company and rejuvenated Ancaster's industrial base. By 1823, the first post office was established. In 1824, the Ancaster Union Church was built. By 1825, Ancaster had constructed a public reading room with papers from Niagara, York and New York. A foundry making plough shears was established in 1825 by William Wiard. In 1826, Jacob Gabel started a tannery; Robert Douglas started a brewery and John Galt established Ancaster as his headquarters for the Canada Company. 1827 marked the year that inaugurated the publication of George Gurnett's Gore Gazette and the Ancaster, Hamilton, Dundas and Flamborough Advertiser. By 1835, Job Lodor was the only person in Upper Canada who managed to obtain banking privileges and thus the Gore Bank was established in the village in 1836. Also in 1836, the population of Ancaster would reach 2,664. In 1837 a group of Red Coated Soldiers appeared in the village to announce the Mackenzie and Papineau rebellions. By 1840 Ancaster had 5 hotels. In 1844, Dr. Richardson opened his practice in the village. Eyre Thuresson founded a threshing machine factory in 1846, a stone mill in 1862, another card mill upstream in 1863 and reorganized the Cane Knitting Factory in 1865. In 1847, N. and E. Wiard re-opened the McLaughlin foundry to make ploughs. Harris and Alonzo Egleston arrived in 1832 and began working at William Wiard's foundry and eventually bought him out. The Egleston's then proceeded to expand their own business empire which included building a foundry in 1843 employing 25 people and rebuilding a gristmill in 1863 at the present day location of the Old Ancaster Mill on the old Dundas Road. This Egleston mill was the 4th Ancaster mill and the third to be rebuilt at this current location. Wilson's original mills burnt down in 1812. Upon rebuilding, Wilson's mills were relocated from this original site at Wilson and Rousseaux Street a little further downstream and rebuilt in stone at the present Old Ancaster Mill location on Old Dundas Road. Again, at the same location, a second mill burnt down in 1818 as well as a third mill that was damaged by fire in 1854. Wilson's original 1791-1792 mill foundations still exist 75 yards upstream from the Wilson and Rousseaux Street intersection but are hidden with vegetation. The much restored and modified remnants of Egleston's 1854 mill now operates as a restaurant and banquet hall. The Barracks of 1812 still stand as a reminder of the War of 1812. By May 1866, the first public telephone was set up in Gurnett's store but was disconnected from lack of use. By 1869, Ancaster was a village in the Township of Ancaster County Wentworth with a population of 500. Mr. K. Thuresson turned out card clothing. The Ancaster Knitting Company employed over 100 in the manufacture of knitted goods. Messrs. H & A Egleston manufactured agricultural implements, cotton and woolen machinery. Mr. A. Egleston employed 20 in woolen and cloth mills.The province of Ontario gazetteer and directory. H. McEvoy Editor and Compiler, Toronto : Robertson & Cook, Publishers, 1869 In 1871 the still existing and currently well-maintained Ancaster Township Hall opened at a cost of $2,400. Additional examples of Victorian architecture are also located on Wilson Street, amongst them the Richardson residence, which was built in 1872 as a wedding present for Dr. Henry Richardson and his new bride Sarah Egleston. Other similar structures includes St. John's Church 1869, the Gurnett home 1826, Gurnett General Store 1826, Hammill house 1860, the Egleston house, Job Lodor's home 1820, Rousseau Hotel 1832 and the Thuresson home 1872 to name just a few. The oldest building in Ancaster is the Tisdale house at 314 Wilson Street, which was built c. 1806 and whose current function is a police museum. The traveling expedition of Edison's magical phonograph was exhibited in the Township Hall in 1878. In 1891, John Heslop was murdered in his home on Mineral Springs Road, and the murder case remains unsolved to this day. After 1900, affluent Hamilton industrialists began purchasing farm land close to Ancaster village for building estates. By 1946, housing subdivisions began to be established around the village and thus began the post-World War II population expansion that continues to this present day with the current housing construction in the Meadowlands subdivision. Ancaster's dominant position in the region as an influential industrial, commercial and farming community throughout the late 18th and early 19th centuries would soon be short-lived due to sudden modern transportation advancements in its neighbouring towns. Soon nearby Dundas and a small farm settlement close to the lakefront that by 1833 would be established as the town of Hamilton would soon become more influential mainly because of the successful completion of the following three transportation projects: the completion of the Burlington Canal in 1832 that connected Burlington Bay (Hamilton Harbour) to Lake Ontario, the completion of the Desjardins Canal in 1837 that enabled lake vessels to enter nearby Dundas through Hamilton Harbour and the completion in 1855 of The Great Western Railway connection to Hamilton (and eventually Dundas) enabled Hamilton, which already had flourishing and expanding ports, to become the prominent urban and commercial settlement in the region. Another factor in Ancaster's gradual economic decline was that stationary steam engines by the 1840s had begun powering industries thus locating industries adjacent to water power was less vital. In fact by this period even Ancaster had started to introduce steam power to its factories however it was no longer able to compete economically with Hamilton's natural shipping harbour and railway.Ancaster's Heritage - A History of Ancaster Township 1973 - Published by the Ancaster Historical Society Page 3 - referenced from http://www.ourroots.ca/ A final contributing factor to Hamilton's dominance was the fact it was chosen to be the administrative center for the new Gore District in 1816 and was voted to be the county town instead of Ancaster. Ancaster had been the leading candidate in 1812 to be the county town and a petition had been signed with 200 signatures to further strengthen that proposal. The petitioners had argued that Ancaster's advantages were its flourishing Union Mills and other industries combined with its elegant setting which they believed would make it the most suitable candidate for building a new county courthouse. However, the War of 1812 had interrupted this original selection process, and by 1816 the promising village of Hamilton was chosen instead even though Ancaster at that time was still the most influential village in Western Upper Canada.http://ourroots.ca/page.aspx?id=889391&qryID=4edd6fd5-f85b-4198-8475-ae7fe4071c39 Ancaster's Heritage Page 31 Ancaster Historical Society 1973 In the latter half of the 19th century Ancaster became an unimposing gristmill hamlet and police village. Ancaster's many derelict burnt down or abandoned factories such as the gutted four story knitting mill and the ruined tannery littered its surroundings in that era like modern ruins that shouted at a former glory.Pen and Pencil sketches of Wentworth Landmarks, The Spectator Printing Company Hamilton 1897, The Ryerson Press Toronto 1967, Pages 12-13 The economic reality was that these former Ancaster factories would be rebuilt elsewhere. Ancaster would not have access to a modern transportation system until the Brantford and Hamilton Electric Railway intersected Ancaster Village in 1907 thus making fresh milk and other perishable foods, general supplies and mail easily deliverable on a daily basis for the first time. The arrival of the B&H; radial line corresponded with the inevitable process of change that Ancaster was undergoing that is clearly recognizable today from that of a former prominent industrial and highly influential self-sufficient village to its current status as a bedroom community of Hamilton. The evidence for this radial train is still easily visible in Ancaster village by a well maintained gravel path behind St. John's Anglican Church on Wilson Street. Walkers and cyclists can still follow this old radial line path down the escarpment (behind Meadowlands Shopping Centre) to the Hamilton Chedoke Golf Course. The radial line was dismantled in 1931 as a condition of sale from the Cataract Company. With the advent of competition from the automobile and bus companies in North America at the turn of the 20th century, generally only publicly owned streetcar companies had the financial means to survive into the 1950s. At the end of the 19th century, the townsfolk of Ancaster were certainly conscious that their town had once been a glowing star in Upper Canada that had quickly lost its luster during the Victorian age despite its second successful wave of industrialization in the 1820s. In 1897, local author Alma Dick-Lauder writing about Ancaster in the Hamilton Spectator using the colourful language of that time lamented that, > So who can say that new life may not once more flow to the aged village, now > high and dry on old time's sand banks, bringing back her bright meridian > bloom and vigour of 70 years ago? Fanned by the breath of electricity to > spring like a Phoenix from her bed of ashes-ashes, understand, being > principally the matter choking up the old place with a fire record > unequalled since the days of Sodom, making her an object of terror to her > friend, derision to her foes and a hoo-doo to the guileless insurance agent. > It is rather melancholy, on a summer's day, to stand on the high bridge and > watch the waters slouching by like a gang of crystal dwarfs out of a job, > idling and playing and painting the 'beautiful, waving hair of the dead' > grass green among the fallen ruins, which a few years ago were instinct with > the hum of industry, pouring forth at stated hours, with jangle of bells, a > cheerful, clattering stream of bread winners, giving life and animation to > the scene, in contrast to the occasional man who now meets the casual glance > up street in the sunny noon hours.Pen and Pencil Sketches of Wentworth > Landmarks, The Spectator Printing Company 1897 Alma Dick-Lauder was referring to the fact that by 1897, although Ancaster Township had a population of 4,000, the solitary industry that remained was Egleston's gristmill. The 'fire record' Alma refers to was the burning of the following: John J. Ryckman's store in 1841, St. Johns Church in 1868, The Ancaster Knitting Factory in 1875, the Morris S. Lowrey Hotel in 1881, Egleston's foundry in 1883, Thuresson's Foundry in 1884 and finally the Ancaster Carriage Factory in 1885. By Alma's expression the 'meridian bloom of 70 years ago' she was referring to the fact that in 1820 Job Lodor had purchased the Union Mills and in so doing had instantly transformed Ancaster's industrial center to the point where it was once again, albeit temporarily, the unrivalled commercial and industrial hub of the Gore district. At the time of Alma's 1897 newspaper article, Ancaster had gone from having three schools in 1835 to just one remaining school but had managed to develop cultural institutions such as an orchestra, a literary society and an enclosed curling rink. Job Lodor as well as many other prominent as well as lesser known early Ancaster settlers left behind sometimes still legible tombstones and grave markers in the cemeteries belonging to St. John's Anglican and St. Andrew's Presbyterian Churches located on Wilson Street. The Ancaster Fair has been an annual agricultural and social event since 1850 except for 1937 when it was cancelled due to a case of infantile paralysis. Originally the fair was held at Wilson and Academy Streets in the Village core. In 1894 it moved to Wilson and Cameron Drive driving park where it remained until its centennial year in 1950 when it moved to Garner Road. After nearly 60 years at the Garner Road site, the Ancaster Fair in 2009 has moved to 630 Trinity Road. In 1976, an Ancaster Town Council vote reversed a long-standing policy that would finally allow Ancaster restaurants to apply for liquor licenses. Other than the LCBO and Brewers Retail outlets that were established in Ancaster in the 1950s, the village had up to that point been 'dry', presumably since Prohibition in Canada. Ancaster's earlier pioneers however experienced an entirely different social environment. Again according to Dick-Lauder writing in 1897, \\"Ancaster saw plenty of life during the rebellion of 1837, when it was quite a frequent thing for all the inns, five in number, and many of the private houses to be full over night of redcoats passing towards the west\\". During this period Ancaster Township was attached variously to Nassau District, Home District, York County (West Riding) and Halton County. When Halton County and Wentworth County joined temporarily from 1850 to 1854, Ancaster remained permanently attached to Wentworth County, where it remains today in the Regional Municipality of Hamilton-Wentworth Ruins of the Hermitage The Hermitage is a popular site in Ancaster. This historic house was once the property of Reverend George Sheed in 1830. Since then the house had changed ownership many times before burning to the ground in 1934. The last owner of The Hermitage was in fact local author Alma Dick-Lauder who has been referenced above. The fire that eventually consumed The Hermitage occurred directly from a party that she had been hosting. The shell of the old house and surrounding buildings can still be visited today. One of the main draws of this old property is the legend of the property being haunted. There are ghost tours run throughout the summer with the tour guides telling haunted stories of the land and the surrounding county.Haunted Hamilton - Local Hauntings - The Hermitage, Ancaster, Ontario Griffin House is a historic house associated with the Underground Railroad. Government When it became part of the Regional Municipality of Hamilton-Wentworth in 1974, the Town of Ancaster absorbed the Township of Ancaster (including other hamlets like Jerseyville, Lynden and Alberton). The new town had two representatives on the regional council which totaled (with the Regional Chair) about 20 members. It was amalgamated with the nearby City of Hamilton in 2001. The amalgamation was bitterly and unsuccessfully protested by its residents and those of adjacent communities (such as Dundas and Flamborough and Glanbrook), particularly since the Progressive Conservative MPP Toni Skarica government had promised in the last election that the amalgamation would not occur. Skarica resigned in protest, and a local Flamborough Mayor, Ted McMeekin, who led the fight in opposing the amalgamation, won the Liberal party nomination winning the by- election on an anti-amalgamation platform. Nonetheless, the amalgamation was not rescinded by the Harris government. Since the 2015 election, the community is in the Hamilton West-Ancaster-Dundas federal electoral district, represented by Filomena Tassi of the Liberal Party of Canada, and in the Hamilton West-Ancaster-Dundas provincial electoral district represented by Sandy Shaw of the Ontario New Democratic Party. Education Ancaster was part of the Wentworth County Board of Education since its inception, and was covered by the Hamilton-Wentworth District School Board when it was created in 1998. The town's only public institution of secondary education was Ancaster High School until 2005. Today, it is no longer classified as a vocational school; its official name is Ancaster High School. Other secondary schools in Ancaster are Bishop Tonnos Secondary School belonging to the Hamilton- Wentworth Catholic District School Board, and Hamilton District Christian High School, an independent Christian high school that moved to Ancaster in 1989. Public elementary schools in Ancaster include Fessenden, Rousseau, and C.H. Bray (kindergarten to Grade 6) and these students upon graduation generally end up going to Ancaster Senior Public School (grades 7 and 8) except for Ancaster Meadow public elementary students (kindergarten to grade 8). In the Catholic elementary school system, St. Ann's, St. Joachim's, Holy Name of Mary and Immaculate Conception students (kindergarten to grade 8) generally end up at Bishop Tonnos Secondary School. Postsecondary education is only available at Redeemer University College, a Christian institution closely associated with the Christian Reformed Church. It was incorporated in 1980 and began classes in Hamilton two years later. It built a campus in Ancaster in 1986 where it had its first graduating class. It had cooperative relations with McMaster University, which provided some instructors and some cross-listed courses. By 2000, it had acquired its present name and its graduates obtained Bachelor of Science and Bachelor of Arts degrees, instead of Bachelor of Christian Studies degrees. The Ancaster Public Library, a branch of the Hamilton Public Library System, originated in 1955 as a member of the Library System of Ontario. It was eventually relocated to 300 Wilson Street East in 1967 as a Centennial project after several previous moves. The library was reopened on November 27, 2006 after an extensive project that involved extending the library to include the entire first floor of the building. Sports and recreation The Hamilton Golf and Country Club was founded in 1894 and was originally sited beside the Hamilton Jockey Club (now Centre Mall), moving to Ancaster in 1916. It hosted the Canadian Open in 2003, 2006, 2012 and again in 2019. The Ancaster Rotary Centre is an addition to Morgan Firestone Arena and includes a full size fitness centre, workout complex and meeting rooms offering 10000 square feet of weights, cardio, group exercise and daycare. The complex is surrounded by the Robert E. Wade Park,Named after former mayor Bob Wade, which includes four baseball diamonds and five soccer fields. A 10.1 million dollar addition of a second ice rink to Morgan Firestone Arena is meant to be completed by March 2011. The Ancaster Little League Park is located on Jerseyville Road in Spring Valley. It is a park comprising three baseball diamonds nestled on the edge of the Dundas Valley Conservation Area. As recently as 2010 Ancaster hosted the Canadian Little League Championships and Little League Park was the main venue. In 1970 Ancaster hosted a so-called 'World T-ball' tournament. The local Ancaster team won the event. There are three diamonds in Little League Park, known locally as T-Ball, Minor and Major. Prior to hosting the Canadian Little League Championships the Major diamond underwent a major reconstruction and with help from the City, Province, and Federal Government the diamond was rebuilt with the addition of proper drainage, professional style clay base paths and warning track, a new PA system as well as the construction of a new clubhouse. Other recreational centres include: * Morgan Firestone Arena * Ancaster Rotary Centre * Ancaster Tennis Club * Ancaster Lions outdoor pool * Ancaster Little League Ball Park * Ancaster Aquatic Centre * Spring Valley Arena Nature The Hamilton Conservation Authority (sometimes in conjunction with the City of Hamilton) operates several sites in Ancaster. Fieldcote Memorial Park and Museum showcases local history (including the area's participation in the Underground Railway), fine arts, gardens and walking paths. The Bruce Trail snakes through Ancaster as it links Queenston with Tobermory. The walking path goes through part of the Dundas Valley Conservation Area and crosses the Hamilton to Brantford Rail Trail.

A state function describes the equilibrium state of a system, thus also describing the type of system. For example, a state function could describe an atom or molecule in a gaseous, liquid, or solid form; a heterogeneous or homogeneous mixture; and the amounts of energy required to create such systems or change them into a different equilibrium state. Internal energy, enthalpy, and entropy are examples of state quantities because they quantitatively describe an equilibrium state of a thermodynamic system, regardless of how the system arrived in that state. In contrast, mechanical work and heat are process quantities or path functions because their values depend on the specific \\"transition\\" (or \\"path\\") between two equilibrium states. Heat (in certain discrete amounts) can describe a state function such as enthalpy, but in general does not truly describe the system unless it is defined as the state function of a certain system, and thus enthalpy is described by an amount of heat. This can also apply to entropy when heat is compared to temperature. The description breaks down for quantities exhibiting hysteresis. History It is likely that the term \\"functions of state\\" was used in a loose sense during the 1850s and 1860s by those such as Rudolf Clausius, William Rankine, Peter Tait, and William Thomson. By the 1870s, the term had acquired a use of its own. In his 1873 paper \\"Graphical Methods in the Thermodynamics of Fluids\\", Willard Gibbs states: \\"The quantities v, p, t, Œµ, and Œ∑ are determined when the state of the body is given, and it may be permitted to call them functions of the state of the body.\\" Overview A thermodynamic system is described by a number of thermodynamic parameters (e.g. temperature, volume, or pressure) which are not necessarily independent. The number of parameters needed to describe the system is the dimension of the state space of the system (). For example, a monatomic gas with a fixed number of particles is a simple case of a two- dimensional system (). Any two-dimensional system is uniquely specified by two parameters. Choosing a different pair of parameters, such as pressure and volume instead of pressure and temperature, creates a different coordinate system in two-dimensional thermodynamic state space but is otherwise equivalent. Pressure and temperature can be used to find volume, pressure and volume can be used to find temperature, and temperature and volume can be used to find pressure. An analogous statement holds for higher-dimensional spaces, as described by the state postulate. Generally, a state function is of the form F(P, V, T, \\\\ldots) = 0, where denotes pressure, denotes temperature, denotes volume, and the ellipsis denotes other possible state variables like particle number and entropy . If the state space is two-dimensional as in the above example, it can be visualized as a three-dimensional graph (a surface in three-dimensional space). However, the labels of the axes are not unique (since there are more than three state variables in this case), and only two independent variables are necessary to define the state. When a system changes state continuously, it traces out a \\"path\\" in the state space. The path can be specified by noting the values of the state parameters as the system traces out the path, whether as a function of time or a function of some other external variable. For example, having the pressure and volume as functions of time from time to will specify a path in two-dimensional state space. Any function of time can then be integrated over the path. For example, to calculate the work done by the system from time to time , calculate W(t_0,t_1)=\\\\int_0^1 P\\\\,dV=\\\\int_{t_0}^{t_1}P(t)\\\\frac{dV(t)}{dt}\\\\,dt. In order to calculate the work in the above integral, the functions and must be known at each time over the entire path. In contrast, a state function only depends upon the system parameters' values at the endpoints of the path. For example, the following equation can be used to calculate the work plus the integral of over the path: :\\\\begin{align} \\\\Phi(t_0,t_1) &= \\\\int_{t_0}^{t_1}P\\\\frac{dV}{dt}\\\\,dt \\\\+ \\\\int_{t_0}^{t_1}V\\\\frac{dP}{dt}\\\\,dt \\\\\\\\\\\\ &= \\\\int_{t_0}^{t_1}\\\\frac{d(PV)}{dt}\\\\,dt = P(t_1)V(t_1)-P(t_0)V(t_0). \\\\end{align} In the equation, the integrand can be expressed as the exact differential of the function . Therefore, the integral can be expressed as the difference in the value of at the end points of the integration. The product is therefore a state function of the system. The notation will be used for an exact differential. In other words, the integral of will be equal to . The symbol will be reserved for an inexact differential, which cannot be integrated without full knowledge of the path. For example, will be used to denote an infinitesimal increment of work. State functions represent quantities or properties of a thermodynamic system, while non-state functions represent a process during which the state functions change. For example, the state function is proportional to the internal energy of an ideal gas, but the work is the amount of energy transferred as the system performs work. Internal energy is identifiable; it is a particular form of energy. Work is the amount of energy that has changed its form or location.

In elementary set theory, Cantor's theorem is a fundamental result which states that, for any set A, the set of all subsets of A (the power set of A, denoted by \\\\mathcal{P}(A)) has a strictly greater cardinality than A itself. For finite sets, Cantor's theorem can be seen to be true by simple enumeration of the number of subsets. Counting the empty set as a subset, a set with n members has a total of 2^n subsets, so that if {\\\\rm card}(A) = n, then {\\\\rm card}(\\\\mathcal{P}(A)) = 2^n, and the theorem holds because 2^n > n for all non-negative integers. Much more significant is Cantor's discovery of an argument that is applicable to any set, which showed that the theorem holds for infinite sets, countable or uncountable, as well as finite ones. As a particularly important consequence, the power set of the set of natural numbers, a countably infinite set with cardinality ‚Ñµ0 = card(‚Ñï), is uncountably infinite and has the same size as the set of real numbers, a cardinality larger than that of the set of natural numbers that is often referred to as the cardinality of the continuum: ùî† = card(‚Ñù) = card(ùí´(‚Ñï)). The relationship between these cardinal numbers is often expressed symbolically by the equality and inequality \\\\mathfrak{c}=2^{\\\\aleph_0}>\\\\aleph_0. The theorem is named for German mathematician Georg Cantor, who first stated and proved it at the end of the 19th century. Cantor's theorem had immediate and important consequences for the philosophy of mathematics. For instance, by iteratively taking the power set of an infinite set and applying Cantor's theorem, we obtain an endless hierarchy of infinite cardinals, each strictly larger than the one before it. Consequently, the theorem implies that there is no largest cardinal number (colloquially, \\"there's no largest infinity\\"). Proof Cantor's argument is elegant and remarkably simple. The complete proof is presented below, with detailed explanations to follow. By definition of cardinality, we have \\\\mathrm{card}(X) < \\\\mathrm{card}(Y) for any two sets X and Y if and only if there is an injective function but no bijective function from X to Y. It suffices to show that there is no surjection from X to Y. This is the heart of Cantor's theorem: there is no surjective function from any set A to its power set. To establish this, it is enough to show that no function f that maps elements in A to subsets of A can reach every possible subset, i.e., we just need to demonstrate the existence of a subset of Athat is not equal to f(x) for any x ‚àà A. (Recall that each f(x) is a subset of A.) Such a subset is given by the following construction, sometimes called the Cantor diagonal set of f: :B=\\\\\\\\{x\\\\in A\\\\,\\\\,x ot\\\\in f(x)\\\\\\\\}. This means, by definition, that for all x ‚àà A, x ‚àà B if and only if x ‚àâ f(x). For all x the sets B and f(x) cannot be the same because B was constructed from elements of A whose images (under f) did not include themselves. More specifically, consider any x ‚àà A, then either x ‚àà f(x) or x ‚àâ f(x). In the former case, f(x) cannot equal B because x ‚àà f(x) by assumption and x ‚àâ B by the construction of B. In the latter case, f(x) cannot equal B because x ‚àâ f(x) by assumption and x ‚àà B by the construction of B. Equivalently, and slightly more formally, we just proved that the existence of Œæ ‚àà A such that f(Œæ) = B implies the following contradiction: :\\\\begin{aligned}\\\\xi \\\\in f(\\\\xi) &\\\\iff \\\\xi \\\\in B && \\\\text{(by assumption that }f(\\\\xi)=B\\\\text{)}; \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\xi\\\\in B &\\\\iff \\\\xi otin f(\\\\xi) && \\\\text{(by definition of }B\\\\text{)}.\\\\end{aligned} Therefore, by reductio ad absurdum, the assumption must be false. Thus there is no Œæ ‚àà A such that f(Œæ) = B; in other words, B is not in the image of f and f does not map to every element of the power set of A, i.e., f is not surjective. Finally, to complete the proof, we need to exhibit an injective function from A to its power set. Finding such a function is trivial: just map x to the singleton set {x}. The argument is now complete, and we have established the strict inequality for any set A that card(A) < card(ùí´(A)). Another way to think of the proof is that B, empty or non-empty, is always in the power set of A. For f to be onto, some element of A must map to B. But that leads to a contradiction: no element of B can map to B because that would contradict the criterion of membership in B, thus the element mapping to B must not be an element of B meaning that it satisfies the criterion for membership in B, another contradiction. So the assumption that an element of A maps to B must be false; and f cannot be onto. Because of the double occurrence of x in the expression \\"x ‚àâ f(x)\\", this is a diagonal argument. For a countable (or finite) set, the argument of the proof given above can be illustrated by constructing a table in which each row is labelled by a unique x from A = {x1, x2, ...}, in this order. A is assumed to admit a linear order so that such table can be constructed. Each column of the table is labelled by a unique y from the power set of A; the columns are ordered by the argument to f, i.e. the column labels are f(x1), f(x2), ..., in this order. The intersection of each row x and column y records a true/false bit whether x ‚àà y. Given the order chosen for the row and column labels, the main diagonal D of this table thus records whether x ‚àà f(x) for each x ‚àà A. The set B constructed in the previous paragraphs coincides with the row labels for the subset of entries on this main diagonal D where the table records that x ‚àà f(x) is false. Each column records the values of the indicator function of the set corresponding to the column. The indicator function of B coincides with the logically negated (swap \\"true\\" and \\"false\\") entries of the main diagonal. Thus the indicator function of B does not agree with any column in at least one entry. Consequently, no column represents B. Despite the simplicity of the above proof, it is rather difficult for an automated theorem prover to produce it. The main difficulty lies in an automated discovery of the Cantor diagonal set. Lawrence Paulson noted in 1992 that Otter could not do it, whereas Isabelle could, albeit with a certain amount of direction in terms of tactics that might perhaps be considered cheating. When A is countably infinite Let us examine the proof for the specific case when A is countably infinite. Without loss of generality, we may take A = ‚Ñï = {1, 2, 3,...}, the set of natural numbers. Suppose that ‚Ñï is equinumerous with its power set ùí´(‚Ñï). Let us see a sample of what ùí´(‚Ñï) looks like: :\\\\mathcal{P}(\\\\mathbb{N})=\\\\\\\\{\\\\varnothing,\\\\\\\\{1, 2\\\\\\\\}, \\\\\\\\{1, 2, 3\\\\\\\\}, \\\\\\\\{4\\\\\\\\}, \\\\\\\\{1, 5\\\\\\\\}, \\\\\\\\{3, 4, 6\\\\\\\\}, \\\\\\\\{2, 4, 6,\\\\dots\\\\\\\\},\\\\dots\\\\\\\\}. ùí´(‚Ñï) contains infinite subsets of ‚Ñï, e.g. the set of all even numbers {2, 4, 6,...}, as well as the empty set. Now that we have an idea of what the elements of ùí´(‚Ñï) look like, let us attempt to pair off each element of ‚Ñï with each element of ùí´(‚Ñï) to show that these infinite sets are equinumerous. In other words, we will attempt to pair off each element of ‚Ñï with an element from the infinite set ùí´(‚Ñï), so that no element from either infinite set remains unpaired. Such an attempt to pair elements would look like this: :\\\\mathbb{N}\\\\begin{Bmatrix} 1 & \\\\longleftrightarrow & \\\\\\\\{4, 5\\\\\\\\}\\\\\\\\\\\\ 2 & \\\\longleftrightarrow & \\\\\\\\{1, 2, 3\\\\\\\\} \\\\\\\\\\\\ 3 & \\\\longleftrightarrow & \\\\\\\\{4, 5, 6\\\\\\\\} \\\\\\\\\\\\ 4 & \\\\longleftrightarrow & \\\\\\\\{1, 3, 5\\\\\\\\} \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\vdots & \\\\vdots & \\\\vdots \\\\end{Bmatrix}\\\\mathcal{P}(\\\\mathbb{N}). Given such a pairing, some natural numbers are paired with subsets that contain the very same number. For instance, in our example the number 2 is paired with the subset {1, 2, 3}, which contains 2 as a member. Let us call such numbers selfish. Other natural numbers are paired with subsets that do not contain them. For instance, in our example the number 1 is paired with the subset {4, 5}, which does not contain the number 1. Call these numbers non-selfish. Likewise, 3 and 4 are non- selfish. Using this idea, let us build a special set of natural numbers. This set will provide the contradiction we seek. Let B be the set of all non- selfish natural numbers. By definition, the power set ùí´(‚Ñï) contains all sets of natural numbers, and so it contains this set B as an element. If the mapping is bijective, B must be paired off with some natural number, say b. However, this causes a problem. If b is in B, then b is selfish because it is in the corresponding set, which contradicts the definition of B. If b is not in B, then it is non-selfish and it should instead be a member of B. Therefore, no such element b which maps to B can exist. Since there is no natural number which can be paired with B, we have contradicted our original supposition, that there is a bijection between ‚Ñï and ùí´(‚Ñï). Note that the set B may be empty. This would mean that every natural number x maps to a subset of natural numbers that contains x. Then, every number maps to a nonempty set and no number maps to the empty set. But the empty set is a member of ùí´(‚Ñï), so the mapping still does not cover ùí´(‚Ñï). Through this proof by contradiction we have proven that the cardinality of ‚Ñï and ùí´(‚Ñï) cannot be equal. We also know that the cardinality of ùí´(‚Ñï) cannot be less than the cardinality of ‚Ñï because ùí´(‚Ñï) contains all singletons, by definition, and these singletons form a \\"copy\\" of ‚Ñï inside of ùí´(‚Ñï). Therefore, only one possibility remains, and that is that the cardinality of ùí´(‚Ñï) is strictly greater than the cardinality of ‚Ñï, proving Cantor's theorem. Related paradoxes Cantor's theorem and its proof are closely related to two paradoxes of set theory. Cantor's paradox is the name given to a contradiction following from Cantor's theorem together with the assumption that there is a set containing all sets, the universal set V. In order to distinguish this paradox from the next one discussed below, it is important to note what this contradiction is. By Cantor's theorem \\\\mathcal{P}(X) > X for any set X. On the other hand, all elements of \\\\mathcal{P}(V) are sets, and thus contained in V, therefore \\\\mathcal{P}(V) \\\\leqslant V. Another paradox can be derived from the proof of Cantor's theorem by instantiating the function f with the identity function; this turns Cantor's diagonal set into what is sometimes called the Russell set of a given set A: :R_A=\\\\left\\\\\\\\{\\\\,x\\\\in A : x ot\\\\in x\\\\,\\\\right\\\\\\\\}. The proof of Cantor's theorem is straightforwardly adapted to show that assuming a set of all sets U exists, then considering its Russell set RU leads to the contradiction: :R_U \\\\in R_U \\\\iff R_U otin R_U. This argument is known as Russell's paradox. As a point of subtlety, the version of Russell's paradox we have presented here is actually a theorem of Zermelo; we can conclude from the contradiction obtained that we must reject the hypothesis that RU‚ààU, thus disproving the existence of a set containing all sets. This was possible because we have used restricted comprehension (as featured in ZFC) in the definition of RA above, which in turn entailed that :R_U \\\\in R_U \\\\iff (R_U \\\\in U \\\\wedge R_U otin R_U). Had we used unrestricted comprehension (as in Frege's system for instance) by defining the Russell set simply as R=\\\\left\\\\\\\\{\\\\,x : x ot\\\\in x\\\\,\\\\right\\\\\\\\}, then the axiom system itself would have entailed the contradiction, with no further hypotheses needed. Despite the syntactical similarities between the Russell set (in either variant) and the Cantor diagonal set, Alonzo Church emphasized that Russell's paradox is independent of considerations of cardinality and its underlying notions like one-to-one correspondence.Church, A. [1974] \\"Set theory with a universal set.\\" in Proceedings of the Tarski Symposium. Proceedings of Symposia in Pure Mathematics XXV, ed. L. Henkin, Providence RI, Second printing with additions 1979, pp. 297‚àí308. . Also published in International Logic Review 15 pp. 11‚àí23. History Cantor gave essentially this proof in a paper published in 1891 \\"√úber eine elementare Frage der Mannigfaltigkeitslehre\\", where the diagonal argument for the uncountability of the reals also first appears (he had earlier proved the uncountability of the reals by other methods). The version of this argument he gave in that paper was phrased in terms of indicator functions on a set rather than subsets of a set. He showed that if f is a function defined on X whose values are 2-valued functions on X, then the 2-valued function G(x) = 1 ‚àí f(x)(x) is not in the range of f. Bertrand Russell has a very similar proof in Principles of Mathematics (1903, section 348), where he shows that there are more propositional functions than objects. \\"For suppose a correlation of all objects and some propositional functions to have been affected, and let phi-x be the correlate of x. Then \\"not-phi-x(x),\\" i.e. \\"phi-x does not hold of x\\" is a propositional function not contained in this correlation; for it is true or false of x according as phi-x is false or true of x, and therefore it differs from phi-x for every value of x.\\" He attributes the idea behind the proof to Cantor. Ernst Zermelo has a theorem (which he calls \\"Cantor's Theorem\\") that is identical to the form above in the paper that became the foundation of modern set theory (\\"Untersuchungen √ºber die Grundlagen der Mengenlehre I\\"), published in 1908. See Zermelo set theory. Generalizations Cantor's theorem has been generalized to any category with products.

History  American breakcore DJ Donna Summer performing live at Glastonbury Festival, UK. As the early days of \\"hardcore techno\\" or just \\"hardcore\\" began to settle in Europe, breakcore as a genre began to take more concrete forms in other parts of the world. Inspired by new labels such as Addict, from Milwaukee, USA; Peace Off from Rennes, France; Sonic Belligeranza from Bologna, Italy; and Planet Mu, from London, it began to take a new shape, adding in more elements of mashup and IDM to the hardcore sounds. Each of these labels began to draw in aspects of their own social and aesthetic scenes into their music, allowing for an even broader definition of what was possible in the music. In Notes on Breakcore, Society Suckers explained that breakcore grew out of the mid-1990s acid techno rave culture and disdain for Neo-Nazis, a disdain shared by early hardcore (gabber). In Europe, the breakcore genre was solidified by raves and club events such as Belgium's Breakcore Gives Me Wood, featuring local acts such as UndaCova and Sickboy; Breakcore A Go Go, in the Netherlands, which was run by FFF and Bong- Ra; as well as Anticartel, in Rennes, the seat of PeaceOff, and later, Wasted, in Berlin and Bangface in London. Breakcore has been subject to changing and branching. Many newer breakcore artists (such as Mochipet etc.) focus on melodic progressions and complex drum programming while other artists still focus on distorted hardcore breakbeats and dark-edged musical influences (such as heavy metal, and industrial). The artist Venetian Snares has produced breakcore blended with elements of classical music.\\"Rossz Csillag Alatt Szuletett\\" review, Tiny Mix TapesDetrimentalist! review, \\"Soundcheck\\", The Wire 293, July 2008, p. 60. Other artists such as Shitmat, Sickboy, DJ Scotch Egg, and Drop the LimeVivian Host, \\"Night Music\\", XLR8R 123, December 2008, p. 40. take another direction towards mash-up, happy hardcore, and rave to make a lighter, more humorous sound. The rise of Chiptune music has also blended with breakcore with artists such as Tarmvred. The UK Free Party scene has also expressed a large interest in producing and distributing its own takes on breakcore, with crews and labels such as Life4land, Hekate, Headfuk, and Bad Sekta helping to push the scene and sound forward, as well as bringing over a number of international artists to play at their parties and club nights. Breakcore is steadily gaining in popularity, and aspiring artists are found scattered across the Internet. In Breakcore: Identity and Interaction on Peer- to-Peer, sociologist Andrew Whelan notes that Venetian Snares has become \\"synonymous with breakcore such that alternative styles are being sidelined.\\" He adds that breakcore is the best example of a music genre whose development is intrinsically linked to online and peer-to-peer distribution.  Characteristics  The most defining characteristic of breakcore is the drum work, which is often based on the manipulation of the Amen break and other classic jungle and hip-hop breaks, at high BPM. The techniques applied to achieve this differs from musician to musician, some preferring to cut up and rearrange the breaks, while others merely distort and loop breaks or apply various effects such as delay and chorus to alter the break's timbre. Melodically, there is nothing that defines breakcore. Classic rave sounds such as acid bass lines, Hoovers and Reese bass are common, but breakcore is mostly known for sampling sounds from all over the musical spectrum to accommodate the frantic and fast-paced nature of the rhythm section. Around the turn of the century, more and more breakcore musicians began employing traditional synthesis techniques to compose elaborate melodies and harmonies. There are a growing number of musicians who make use of recorded live instrumentation in their music, such as Istari Lasterfahrer, Hecate, Benn Jordan, Ruby My Dear, Q√ºatros, Venetian Snares, and Igorrr. According to Simon Reynolds of The New York Times, \\"purveyed by artists like DJ/Rupture and Teamshadetek, the [breakcore] music combines rumbling bass lines, fidgety beats and grainy ragga vocals to create a home-listening surrogate for the 'bashment' vibe of a Jamaican sound system party. Others within the breakcore genre, like Knifehandchop, Kid 606 and Soundmurderer, hark back to rave's own early days, their music evoking the rowdy fervor of a time when huge crowds flailed their limbs to a barrage of abstract noise and convulsive rhythm. It's a poignant aural mirage of a time when techno music was made for the popular vanguard rather than a connoisseurial elite, as it is today.\\" One of the most controversial issues in breakcore is that of the mere existence of the genre. Because it pulls liberally from other musical genres, there is not a consensus on what is and what is not breakcore, or even over the usefulness of the term itself. = Raggacore = Raggacore is a style of music derived from ragga jungle that somewhat predates breakcore, characterized by ragga and dancehall rhythms and vocals.. Its roots can arguably be traced back to jungle producer Remarc, who was one of the first producers to mix ragga and dancehall vocals with chaotic and intricately rearranged break beats. While only a few producers primarily work in the style, it still has a sizable following among breakcore fans. Notable examples of this style include Aaron Spectre, Bong-Ra, Cardopusher, Enduser, FFF, LFO Demon, Renard Queenston, Lemon Drizlay Crew, Ruby my Dear, Istari Lasterfahrer, Shitmat, Venetian Snares, and Stivs from the Life4Land crew.  Influences  In London, DJ Scud co-founded Ambush Records in 1997 with fellow producer Aphasic to focus on more extreme noise- oriented hardcore drum and bass. Some artists released on Ambush are Christoph Fringeli, Slepcy, The Panacea, and Noize Creator. \\"Scud and Nomex tracks like 'Total Destruction' helped create the blueprint for much of breakcore's sound, a high-bpm mash-up of hyperkinetic, post-jungle breaks, feedback, noise, and Jamaican elements paired with a devil-may-care attitude towards sampling that pulls from the broadest musical spectrum of styles (hip-hop, rock, industrial, pop, and beyond).\\"Matt Earp, \\"Breakcore: Live Fast\\", XLR8R, July 20, 2006. Access date: August 8, 2008. At the same time, Bloody Fist Records based in Newcastle, Australia released many records of hardcore/gabber, industrial, and noise. Artists signed to Bloody Fist in its lifetime include Syndicate, Xylocaine, Epsilon and Nasenbluten. Label founder Mark Newlands said, in 1997, \\"I think that the uncomfortableness also comes from a reaction towards the mainstream and popular culture that's constantly shoved down our throats, that's forced on the people via television, radio, mass media, etc. I think that also fuels the fire and keeps the aggressiveness there and the uncomfortableness.\\"Interview in Datacide Three, October 1997 Newlands described their music as products of \\"cut'n'paste mentality\\" and an industrial environment. In her Experimental Music, Gail Priest credits the label as recognized globally for its contributions to the breakcore genre, and for spurring its 1990s development. The Bloody Fist sound became breakcore from what was the noise genre, with added elements of high beats per minute and \\"extreme, thick, low-fi textures\\". By way of example, Nasenbluten's 1996 Fuck Anna Wood exemplified this style with controversial public affairs audio samples collaged into dialogue atop early hardcore beats. Formed in 1994, Digital Hardcore Recordings released music by artists such as Alec Empire, Shizuo, Atari Teenage Riot, EC8OR and Bomb20, shaping the breakcore sound. This label is also responsible for Digital Hardcore, a genre developed simultaneously to breakcore. The Alec Empire album The Destroyer is often noted as the first breakcore album.  Distribution  Because of the fragmentation, the breakcore scene is not centered in any one geographical location, but is rather scattered into disparate groups. Perhaps the one place where breakcore's \\"voice\\" can be heard is virtually, through the internet and various online forums, such as those at C8 and Widerstand (Eiterherd's website, now defunct). Since the genre as a whole still is developing and growing rapidly, the music itself is largely downloaded via peer-to-peer networks, and discussed on internet forums. Whereas the early days of breakcore were based in select urban cities, the genre now has no geographical center. The music itself tends to reflect this multiplicity of media diffusion itself by incorporating many different forms of music hacked together. It remains a relatively small genre, but compared to its size prior to the 1990s web boom, it continues to grow substantially.  Reception  Vice magazine compared the genre to the types of music used during Guantanamo Bay interrogations. The magazine praised Venetian Snares as a highlight in the genre.

It is currently published by Penny Publications. From January 2017, the publication frequency is bimonthly (six issues per year). Circulation in 2012 was 22,593, as reported in the annual Locus magazine survey.Locus, February 2012 issue.  History  Asimov's Science Fiction began life as the digest-sized Isaac Asimov's Science Fiction Magazine (or IASFM for short) in 1977. Joel Davis of Davis Publications approached Asimov to lend his name to a new science fiction magazine, after the fashion of Ellery Queen's Mystery Magazine or Alfred Hitchcock's Mystery Magazine. Asimov refused to act as editor, but served instead as editorial director, writing editorials and replying to reader mail until his death in 1992. At Asimov's request George Scithers, the first editor, negotiated an acquisitions contract with the Science Fiction Writers of America providing considerably better terms for writers than had been the periodical standard up to that time. Initially a quarterly, its first issue was dated Spring 1977.http://www.luminist.org/archives/SF/ASI.htm - the cover of \\"Spring 1976\\" declares itself \\"first issue\\", the editorial inside supports this. It changed to a bimonthly in 1978 and began publishing monthly in 1979. In the mid-1980s it was published once every four weeks, with an extra \\"mid-December\\" issue (for a total of 13 issues per year). Double issues were added in the early 1990s (while staying at 13 total issues per year) before the schedule was scaled back to 10 issues per year by 2004. From January 2017, the schedule was changed to six \\"double-sized\\" issues per year. The magazine was sold to Bantam Doubleday Dell in January 1992, a few months before Asimov's death, and the title changed to Asimov's Science Fiction. In 1996, Dell Magazines was acquired from BDD by Crosstown Publications, and as of 2012 is part of Penny Publications which is under the same ownership as Crosstown Publications has been, with headquarters in Norwalk, Connecticut and uses a combined Customer Service labelled Penny Press/Dell Magazines. In 1998, the magazine's size changed; it is now taller and slightly wider than the standard digest format (matching other magazines published by its newest corporate parent). Asimov's Science Fiction celebrated its thirtieth anniversary in 2007, with an anthology edited by the magazine's current editor, Sheila Williams. Drawing on stories published from 1977 to the present day, it was published by Tachyon Publications. Martin Gardner wrote a regular column of \\"puzzle tales\\" for the magazine from 1977 to 1986. He produced 111 columns in all, many later published in book form. =Editors= * George H.

Dofasco is a standalone subsidiary of ArcelorMittal, the world's largest integrated steel producer. History Clifton and Frank A. Sherman founded Dominion Foundries and Steel in 1912, creating a giant that would bring prosperity and identity to the city of Hamilton, Ontario. Dofasco was incorporated as Dominion Steel Castings Company Limited in 1912, becoming Dominion Foundries and Steel Company in 1917. Sherman Mine opened in 1968 and closed in 1990. Its longtime nickname \\"Dofasco\\" was adopted as its legal name in 1980. Frank H. Sherman (Frank A.'s son) introduced to Dofasco and North America in 1954 the method of steel production known as basic oxygen steelmaking (BOS), thus rendering former processes obsolete because, with respect to them, the same quantity of steel from a BOS process is manufactured in one-twelfth the time. Basic oxygen steelmaking is superior to previous steelmaking methods because the oxygen pumped into the furnace limited impurities, primarily nitrogen, that previously had entered from the air used. Dofasco owned and operated a number of subsidiaries, including National Steel Car, a Hamilton-based railway freight car manufacturer, from 1962 to 1994, and Algoma Steel, from 1988 to 1991, until union and financial difficulties ultimately forced Dofasco to divest the company. In 1990, the world economy tanked. Dofasco lost $900 million in three years from 1991, in addition to the write-off of $700 million when it sold Algoma. Dofasco was the owner of the Adams and Sherman iron ore mines in Northeastern Ontario until 1990 when Dofasco announced that they would be closing the mines. During the recession of the early 1990s, Dofasco made its first permanent layoffs since the Great Depression of the 1930s. Dofasco has won awards for being the \\"most sustainable manufacturing company\\" in North America. =Acquisition= In January 2006, Luxembourg-based Arcelor, then the world's second largest steel producer by volume, outbid rival German steel producer, ThyssenKrupp AG, to purchase Dofasco. Analysts cited the strengths of Dofasco, including its non-unionized workforce, strong automotive customer base, its unique thin high-strength steel product, and ownership of a Canadian ore mine.Search - Global Edition - The New York Times Dofasco's Canadian management initially didn't want to be taken over. After Arcelor initially presented a hostile bid of $56 per share, ThyssenKrupp and Dofasco signalled their intentions to enter into a friendly merger. Under that plan, Dofasco would have retained its employee profit-sharing plan and placed in charge of all of ThyssenKrupp's North American operations. Arcelor raised its offer significantly, causing ThyssenKrupp to pull out as further bidding would have downgraded its credit rating. Dofasco paid ThyssenKrupp a breakup fee of $215 million. Dofasco's board recommended the latest Arcelor offer of $71 per share in cash, worth an estimated $5.5 billion. While the breakup fee was criticized by some as excessive, most analysts otherwise praised President and CEO Donald A. Pether and the board of directors for their successful handling of the bidding situation. Arcelor was itself three months later taken over by the world's largest steel producer, Mittal. However, in an effort to prevent Dofasco from falling into ThyssenKrupp's hands, Arcelor management locked Dofasco into an independent trust based in the Netherlands. Dofasco is now part of the combined ArcelorMittal, and has been integrated into their international operations. Labour relations Unlike rival Stelco, Dofasco is not unionized. As a result, Dofasco has avoided many of the strikes and work stoppages which have plagued its cross-town rival. However, there have been some complaints that the employee benefits are too generous. Some investors complained that the profits should have been distributed to shareholders as a special dividend rather than giving workers larger bonuses, which was a factor in the underperforming stock price despite strong results. As of January 1, 2013, Dofasco (now a standalone subsidiary) reduced the benefits for both drug and dental and changed to a defined contribution pension plan for many of its employees.http://www.thespec.com/news/business/article/736528--the-dofasco-way While several unsuccessful attempts have been made to organize by the United Steelworkers of America, union negotiations at Stelco may have influenced wages and benefits at Dofasco. In 2007, Dofasco was named one of Canada's Top 100 Employers, as published in Maclean's magazine, the only steelmaker to receive this honour. The most recent win came in 2020. https://reviews.canadastop100.com/top-employer-arcelormittal-dofasco Since 1937, Dofasco has annually held a large Christmas party, typically featuring 30,000 guests and a 30-foot (9 m) tree. During the early years, the party was held in one of the large mill buildings on Gage Ave. From 1993 to 2009, the party was held at Copps Coliseum.ArcelorMittal - 2010 Family Christmas Party In 2010, the company moved the party to the company-owned recreation park. Pollution Steelmaking in Canada has long been associated with pollution. For example, in 1989 Dofasco and Stelco were listed among the \\"dirty dozen\\" polluters in Ontario: In 2014, the company pleaded guilty to violating air quality standards in 2012 and paid violation and victim surcharge fines of approximately half a million dollars. In 2015, there was an accidental release of a large plume of iron oxide dust at the plant due to an instrument failure and Dofasco has been working to address air pollution Company slogan A Dofasco product‚Äîa railway locomotive bogie in New Zealand‚Äîbears the company's name and country of origin. Since 1970, the company has used the same corporate slogan‚Äî\\"Our product is steel. Our strength is people.\\"‚Äîto create what Marketing Magazine has called \\"one of the most clearly defined corporate images in the country\\". The slogan was created by Hamilton-based Kelly Advertising, who have been the company's advertising agency since 1927. The slogan can also be seen as recognizing the importance of its workforce, as the company says it has a good relationship with its employees. For a short time, the slogan contained a third line: \\"Our home is Hamilton.\\"  References  =Bibliography= *  External links  * ArcelorMittal Dofasco Corporate Website * History of Dofasco Category:Steel companies of Canada Category:Companies based in Hamilton, Ontario Category:Manufacturing companies established in 1912 Category:Canadian subsidiaries of foreign companies Category:1912 establishments in Ontario Category:Canadian companies established in 1912 ","title":"Dofasco"},{"id":"341455","text":"Indy 500 is a nickname for the Indianapolis 500, a famous automobile race first held in 1911.

For the French rapper, see Vald (rapper) A municipality (, plural ) is the smallest administrative subdivision of Estonia. Each municipality is a unit of self-government with its representative and executive bodies. The municipalities in Estonia cover the entire territory of the country. Municipalities in Estonia are of two types: *Urban municipalities or towns (, singular ) *Rural municipalities or parishes (, singular ). There is no other status distinction between them. Municipalities may contain one or several settlements. All urban municipalities plus 6 rural municipalities contain only one settlement. Of the latter six, 5 are so-called \\"borough-parishes\\", consisting of one borough, while Ruhnu Parish consists of one village. Some municipalities are divided into districts. The 8 urban districts (, singular ) of Tallinn have limited self-government, while other urban districts are formed for administrative purposes. Some rural districts () have limited self-government, while other types of rural districts do not. Municipalities range in population from Tallinn with 427,500 inhabitants to Ruhnu with 68. Previously, as over two- thirds of the municipalities had a population of under 3,000, many of them found it advantageous to co-operate in providing services and carrying out administrative functions. Currently, after the administrative reform was completed in October 2017, there are total of 79 municipalities, 15 of which are urban and 64 rural. 51 of the present municipalities were the result of mergers, 28 remain unchanged. After the reform small municipalities with under 5,000 inhabitants have been reduced from a number of 169 to 15. The number of councillors was reduced from 2,026 to 1,019.

The council () is a representative body elected by the residents of a municipality for a term of three years. The members of the council elect a chairman (), who organises the council's work and represents the municipality. The government () is an executive body formed by the council. It is headed by a mayor ( in towns, in parishes), who is appointed for a four-year term. The mayor cannot be the chairman of the council. Other members of the government are chosen by the mayor with the approval of the council.

He was the second President since Estonia regained independence in 1991. R√º√ºtel also served as one of fifteen Deputy Chairmen of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR. Childhood R√º√ºtel born in Pahavalla village in Laimjala Parish, Saaremaa. His parents was Feodor R√º√ºtel (1900‚àí1965) and Juulia R√º√ºtel (1905‚àí1995). During the Soviet Era On April 8, 1983, he was appointed as Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Council of the Estonian SSR; thus he was also one of the 15 deputy chairmen of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR. On March 29, 1990, he was elected as Chairman of the Supreme Soviet of the Republic of Estonia. He served during the confirmation of Estonia's independence on August 20, 1991. R√º√ºtel continued in office until October 6, 1992. Independent Estonia R√º√ºtel was also a member of the Constitutional Assembly from 1991 to 1992, which drafted the new Constitution of the Republic of Estonia. He stood as a candidate in the first presidential election in 1992. In the first round, where the people voted, R√º√ºtel came first, receiving 43% of the votes. The second round was held in the Riigikogu, whose members voted for the two leading candidates of the first round; there, R√º√ºtel lost to Lennart Meri. In 1991, R√º√ºtel took his Doctorate in agriculture. He served as Chairman of the People's Union of Estonia from 1994 to 2000, and was elected as a member of the Estonian Parliament, the Riigikogu, in 1995, where he acted as Vice-Chairman until 1997. He ran for President in the 1996 election (this time an indirect election with no popular vote) and lost to Meri once again. Presidential term He was elected President by an electoral college on September 21, 2001, defeating Toomas Savi in the final round by votes of 186 to 155. R√º√ºtel was inaugurated as President of the Republic on October 8, 2001. Mart Laar's cabinet eventually fell later the same year. R√º√ºtel announced in his election manifesto that his principal aims would be to reduce the negative effects that Estonia's speedy economic changes had had on a large number of people, and to seek greater solidarity within the society. 2006 candidacy The end of R√º√ºtel's term was overshadowed by several controversies. On the Independence Day military parade on February 24, 2005, R√º√ºtel repeatedly congratulated soldiers on 'Victory day' (Estonian Victory Day is on June 23), which caused speculation about the then 76-year-old president's mental health. In January 2006, Estonian Television reported that R√º√ºtel's underage granddaughters had organized a party in the presidential palace and drunk alcohol.Nikolai Adashkevich, \\"Estonia leader shocked by granddaughters' palace parties-paper\\", RIA Novosti, January 20, 2006. Later that year, the newspaper Eesti Ekspress published archived documents suggesting that R√º√ºtel as a top functionary of the Estonian SSR was involved in the persecution of scientist Johannes Hint (later sentenced to jail in a show trial) by the KGB. R√º√ºtel himself commented that he had tried to defend Hint.The President of the Republic of Estonia 2001‚Äì2006: Statement of the President of the Republic of Estonia on September 5, 2006 As R√º√ºtel's term was due to end in October 2006, he announced on June 7, 2006, that he would be a candidate for re-election, thus ending speculation as to his candidacy.DELFI: R√º√ºtel kandideerib teiseks ametiajaks In late August, the parliament failed to elect a President. The election of Ene Ergma and Toomas Hendrik Ilves by the parliament was blocked by R√º√ºtel's supporters, who did not take out ballots. The electoral college met to vote for a president on September 23. The latest opinion polls (September 2006) had suggested that R√º√ºtel's popular support was around 31 per cent (Ilves' support was 51%); R√º√ºtel was more popular amongst the elderly and the Russian-speaking minority. In the electoral college, R√º√ºtel received 162 votes against 174 for Ilves. R√º√ºtel congratulated the winner and offered his assistance. R√º√ºtel's presidency therefore expired at the end of his term, and Ilves took office on October 9, 2006. Later activities R√º√ºtel voiced support for Mart Helme of the Conservative People's Party of Estonia in the 2016 Estonian presidential election.

He was born in London to a Scottish father, Alexander Binnie, and Hannah Carr from Castle Sowerby, Cumberland.1851 England Census He was baptised at the Swallow Street Scotch Church, where his grandfather Alexander Birnie was an elder. He trained as an engineer by being articled in 1858 to Terence Flannagan and afterwards to Frederic la Trobe Bateman. He then worked on railways in mid-Wales before moving in 1868 to India to engineer the Nagpur water supply system. He received the Telford Medal of the Institution of Civil Engineers in 1875 for his paper on the Nagpur Waterworks. In 1875, he returned to England as Chief Engineer for Waterworks for the City of Bradford, West Yorkshire where he was concerned with the repair and construction of reservoirs and large water supply projects. He was then offered the post of Chief Engineer to the London County Council in 1890, a post he held until 1902. Binnie's Vauxhall Bridge As chief engineer for the London County Council, his design feats included the first Blackwall Tunnel (1897) and Greenwich foot tunnel (1902) (both in Greenwich, London) and, further upstream, Vauxhall Bridge (1906). He was knighted in 1897 by Queen Victoria for services to engineering and elected President of the Institution of Civil Engineers in 1905. He also designed, with Sir Benjamin Baker, major parts of London's drainage system, including east London sewage treatment works at Crossness and Barking on the south and north sides of the Thames respectively (these were sited at the ends of the sewer outfalls created by Sir Joseph Bazalgette during the late 19th century). Like several other notable engineers of the late 19th and early 20th centuries (e.g. Sir William Halcrow, Sir Alexander Gibb), Binnie founded a firm under his name, which his son William took over on his father's retirement. In 1909, Sir Alexander Binnie and Son merged with another engineering consultancy to become Sir Alexander Binnie, Son & Deacon; later it became Binnie & Partners and from the 1990s it has been part of the multi-national Black & Veatch consultancy. Binnie married, in 1865, Mary Frances Eames, the daughter of Dr. William J. Eames, of Londonderry.Ireland, Select Marriages, 1619-1898 Lady Binnie died in London 21 September 1901.
