It is found in Algeria, Libya, Morocco, and Tunisia. The parasitic organism Toxoplasma gondii was first described in 1908 in Tunis by Charles Nicolle and Louis Manceaux within the tissues of the gundi. Description The common gundi grows to a length of between , having a stumpy tail of . A gundi weighs about . It resembles a guinea pig in appearance, having big eyes, flat ears and short limbs. Each foot has four digits and sharp, dark claws; the two hind feet have comblike bristles between the claws. Gundi's teeth are rootless. Distribution This gundi is found in northern Africa on the south side of the Atlas Mountains at altitudes up to about . Its range extends from western Libya through Tunisia and Algeria to eastern Morocco. Ecology Gundis are diurnal and herbivorous. It lives in rocky, arid places, making its home in crevices and under boulders. These homes are usually temporary. In the early morning, gundis sunbathe until the temperature passes 20° C (68°F). Once it's hot enough, the gundis will forage and eat, then go back to sunbathing on warm rocks. They will shelter in the shade once the temperature reaches 32° C (90° F). Only after the temperature drops again, in the afternoon, do gundis leave their shelter. It forages for leaves, stems, flowers and seeds over large distances because of the scarcity of suitable plants. It does not drink, obtaining sufficient water from its diet, nor does it store food as do some desert rodents. Gundis make chirp-like sounds to communicate with each other. If alarmed, they thump their hind feet as well. A gundi reaches sexual maturity at the age of nine to twelve months. The gestation period is estimated to be 57 days and the litter size averages just under two. Gundis are born with open eyes and fur. They are able to control their body temperature from birth, and are weaned after only four weeks. The interval between litters is about 70 days. The gundi is a territorial species, with family groups of between three and eleven adults defending a territory. Gundis live in colonies, and within these colonies, gundis live in separate units. A unit can be a female, male, and their offspring, or multiple females with juveniles. Gundis sleep in piles to stay warm during the winter. Of the common gundis tested in southeastern Tunisia, nearly half were found to harbour Leishmania parasites; Leishmania tropica was found in five individuals and Leishmania major in one. These protozoan parasites are causative agents of cutaneous leishmaniasis, a skin disease transmitted by female sandflies, and it is thought that the gundi may act as a natural reservoir for the pathogen. Status The common gundi is a fairly common species with a wide range, and no particular threats have been identified. Its abundance varies according to the amount of precipitation that falls; in the west of its range it is replaced by Val's gundi (Ctenodactylus vali) in dry years. The International Union for Conservation of Nature has assessed it as being a species of \\"least concern\\".

Fruits are about the size of grapes and taste like cucumbers with a tinge of sourness. Vernacular names include mouse melon, Mexican sour gherkin, cucamelon, Mexican miniature watermelon, Mexican sour cucumber and pepquinos. This plant is native to Mexico and Central America, where it is called : 'little watermelon', from : 'watermelon'. It is believed to have been a domesticated crop before Western colonization of the Americas began. Etymology The genus name ' is from Ancient Greek μηλοθρων : mēlothrōn 'kind of white grape' in reference to small grapevine fruits born by the genus. The specific name ' means 'rough, scabby. Development Melothria scabra female flower These plants are slow-growing when they are establishing themselves, but can eventually grow up to ten feet under proper conditions. They are drought resistant and pest-resistant relative to other cucumbers. Similar to the cucumber, these plants are monoecious, producing both male and female flowers on the same plant. These plants can pollinate themselves, but the individual flowers are not self-fertile. Flowers are small and yellow, about four millimeters in diameter. Fruits develop at the base of the female flower.

Lyon, that stars Faith Domergue, Richard Long, Kathleen Hughes, Marshall Thompson, Jack Kelly, William Reynolds, and David Janssen. The film was released as a double feature with Revenge of the Creature. Six American officers witness the secret ritual of Lamians (worshipers of women who can change into serpents). When the soldiers are discovered by the snake cult, the High Lamian Priestess vows that \\"the Cobra Goddess will avenge herself\\". Once back in the United States, a mysterious woman enters into the life of each service man, with disastrous results: \\"accidents\\" begin to happen, and before each death the shadow of a cobra is seen. Critics noted story similarities with Val Lewton's prior horror film Cat People, released in 1942. Plot Shortly before shipping home at the end of World War II, six American Army Air Force non-commissioned officers explore an Asian bazaar. A snake charmer, Daru, allows the men to take pictures of him holding a cobra. Paul Abel mentions the strange cult of the Lamians, who worship snakes and believe that there are people who can transform into them. Daru says quietly that, for a price, Paul can see this for himself. Daru takes the men to the secret Lamian temple, warning them that if caught it will mean their deaths. The six observe a ceremonial dance symbolizing the rescue of the Lamian people by their Cobra Goddess. As the lithe female dancer slides back into a woven basket, the drunk Nick Hommel ignores Daru's warnings and takes a photograph. The temple erupts as the Lamians react in outrage, and their high priest pronounces a death curse on the intruders. Nick fights free of two Lamians and grabs the woven basket, now containing a cobra, from the temple's platform. Daru is killed by the Lamians, while the servicemen set fire to the temple to cover their escape. They speed away in their jeep but slam to a halt when they see Nick lying in the road, a woman standing over him, who silently vanishes. Tom Markel sees that Nick is suffering from a snake bite. Paul looks worriedly at the empty woven basket lying in the road. Recovering in the hospital, Nick assures his friends that he will be able to ship out the next day. As he settles into sleep, something appears from the darkness and slips into his room through an open window. It rears up over him and Nick screams. Devastated by Nick's death, his friends must make their plans to ship out. Paul worries aloud that the high priest's curse may have been more than words. The others scoff as their conversation turns toward civilian life. Alone in his New York City apartment, Tom is startled by a scream coming from the apartment across the passageway. He forces his way in and finds a beautiful, terrified woman named Lisa Moyer, who speaks of an intruder. Tom calms her down and persuades her to spend the day with him. Arriving home that evening, he invites Lisa into his apartment. There, she shows an intense interest in a photograph of the six friends, taken in Asia during the war. Later that night, Rico Nardi, one of the six, locks up his bowling alley and begins to drive home. In his rear-view mirror, he catches sight of something moving in the back seat that strikes at him. The car swerves, crashes, and flips over, killing Rico. As a crowd gathers, a breathless Lisa slips away into the shadows, one of which moves like a cobra. Carl Turner and roommate Pete Norton, two of the remaining six, host a party. Carl comes on to Lisa, and Tom jealously punches him. Tom and Lisa leave, and he later doubles back to return her left-behind gloves. He finds her gone. She returns to the party but it is over, and Carl is cleaning up. As he fixes her a drink, a cobra is suddenly in the room. He throws an object, striking it as the snake lunges at him. Its movement drives him backward, carrying him out an open window to his death below. Bystanders gather as Pete returns and notices Lisa in the crowd, favoring her arm. The police question him, and Lisa returns to her apartment, where she finds Tom dozing. She begins to tell him that she's in love with him (a new experience for her). The next morning, while Tom and Paul have breakfast, Julia Thompson joins them. She is not only Paul's fiancé, but Tom's old girlfriend. They receive a phone call regarding Carl's death, and both head to the police station while Julia cleans up. Lisa comes over and notices Julia looking through books on cults, specifically one about people transforming into snakes. Lisa feels threatened, but a dry cleaner comes by and Julia leaves to get ready for her next show. Paul gives the police his theory about the curse placed on them and thinks that Lisa might have transformed into a cobra in order to kill them. Tom, angry about the accusation, leaves. The inspector dismisses the theory, so Paul requests that a toxicology test be made on Carl and Rico's bodies. Lisa is about to go to Julia's show when Pete surprises her at Tom's apartment. He sees the scratch on her arm and insinuates that she is the killer of his friends. Now cornered, she transforms into a cobra and goes after Pete. At the police station, the toxicology results show that Carl and Rico were killed by cobra venom. Paul and the police arrive at Tom's apartment, where they find Pete's dead body and Tom and Lisa gone. Paul calls Tom at the theater about Pete's death. He wants Tom to keep Lisa there until the police arrive. Lisa, however, has gone into Julia's dressing room. When Julia returns, a cobra tries and fails to strike at her. Tom rushes in and covers up the snake, then uses a coat rack to lift and then push it out a high window. The cobra transforms back into Lisa as she lays dying on the sidewalk below. Later, standing over her now lifeless body, Tom covers her face and walks away into the shadows.

He completed a pass to sophomore Bennie Oosterbaan for a 23-yard gain and followed with a pass to William Flora for an 11-yard gain. Fullback Bo Molenda then ran 24 yards for the touchdown, and Friedman kicked the extra point. Michigan's second touchdown drive started with a 25-yard gain on a pass from Friedman to Oosterbaan. Sophomore halfback Louis Gilbert then ran 20 yards, and Molenda ran for the touchdown from the one-yard line. Friedman kicked the extra point, and Michigan led, 14–0, at halftime. In the third quarter, Friedman threw a touchdown pass to Oosterbaan, and Friedman kicked his third extra point. In the fourth quarter, Minnesota opened up its passing game in an attempt to overcome Michigan's 21–0 lead. Halfway through the quarter, Louis Gilbert intercepted a pass and returned it 60 yards down the right side for a touchdown.

Hillel is both a 2011 Blue Ribbon and IB Middle-Years Program school.  About the school  The school's enrollment is close to 1000 students. Class size in the Lower School ranges from 16-23 depending on grade level. The school has a large international student community, with students ranging from countries all over the Americas, Europe, and Israel. The school consists of an Early Childhood, Lower, Middle and Upper School. It was founded in 1973. The school contains a \\"Dual-curriculum\\" which instructs students in both Judaic and Secular studies, as well as ESOL (English for Speakers of Other Languages) primarily for students coming from South America. Hillel also contains a program for children with certain disabilities called the Kesher (meaning \\"connection\\" in Hebrew) program, run by patient and understanding adults who know how to guide and nurture their students. Unlike Jewish Day Schools in The Solomon Schechter Day School Association, Hillel is affiliated with the Orthodox movement Judaism, though Orthodox students themselves remain a small minority.  History  Hillel was first conceived in the late 1960s by Dr. Joel and Peshe Dennis, Rabbi Max A. Lipschitz, and a handful of other founding fathers and mothers. The kind of traditional Jewish day school they envisioned, now known as The Samuel Scheck Hillel Community Day School, was born in early 1970. In 1976, Hillel moved to its present site in North Miami Beach and expanded its campus to over adjacent to the Michael-Ann Russel Jewish Community Center. Years later, they realized another vital goal with the opening of The Ben Lipson Hillel Community High School. When construction was completed on the high school wing in 1994, the '94 and '95 seniors were there. As the fresh concrete was being poured, they left their footsteps imprinted in what has since come to be known as the \\"Footsteps to the Future.\\"  Athletics  In 2014, Scheck Hillel opened their brand new athletic complex, The Diener Athletic Center. \\"The outdoor portion of the complex also features a softball diamond equipped with digital display boards and an advanced sound system. The Diener Athletic Center, the building that sits on the complex, includes a regulation-size basketball and volleyball courts, a weight and fitness room, locker rooms for men and women, a concession area and multi-use event spaces.\\"https://www.jta.org/2014/10/27/news-opinion/united-states/day-schools- build-new-fields-and-dream Hillel offers a variety of interscholastic sports including:https://www.ehillel.org/page/athletics/athletics-at-scheck-hillel High School Boys Cross Country Football Golf Basketball Soccer, 2016 State Champions https://www.miamiherald.com/sports/high- school/article59496962.html Tennis Volleyball Girls Cross Country Volleyball Golf Basketball Soccer Flag Football Tennis Middle School Boys Football Soccer Basketball Girls Volleyball Soccer Basketball Elementary Boys and Girls Basketball Soccer  Divisions  Hillel consists of three divisions: * The Juda and Maria Diener Lower School, which includes all of the early childhood education (PK) and grades Kindergarten to grade five. * The Henrietta Scheck Middle School, which includes grades six through eight. * The Ben Lipson Hillel Community Upper School, which includes grades nine through twelve.

It features the common features of most Creole cottages: separate entrance doors to each interior room, central chimney, raised basement, and is situated on the front property line. Creole cottage is a type of vernacular architecture indigenous to the Gulf Coast of the United States. The style was a dominant house type along the central Gulf Coast from about 1790 to 1840 in the former settlements of French Louisiana in Alabama, Louisiana, and Mississippi. The style is popularly thought to have evolved from French and Spanish colonial house-forms, although the true origins are unclear. Creole architecture in Louisiana is documented by numerous listings in the U.S. National Register of Historic Places. The \\"Creole cottage\\" type of house was common along the Gulf Coast and associated rivers in the 19th century with a few scattered examples found as far west as Houston, Texas, and as far east as northern Florida, although the majority of structures are found in southern Louisiana eastward to Mobile, Alabama.Gamble, Robert Historic architecture in Alabama: a guide to styles and types, 1810-1930, page 180. Tuscaloosa, Alabama: The University of Alabama Press, 1990. . In Kentucky, a few scattered cottages still stand in the state's far western Jackson Purchase region, where they continued to be built into the early twentieth century.Macintire, William J. '. National Park Service, 1993-02-16, 9. Architectural features Latour and Laclotte's atelier, the urban form of a Creole cottage in New Orleans. Two features of this style of house are thought to be influences from other places in France's former colonial empire. The full front porch is believed to originate from the Caribbean islands, while the high gabled roof, the ridge of which is parallel to the street, accommodating the porch as well as the mass of the house, is thought to be of French Canadian origin.Gamble, Robert Historic architecture in Alabama: a guide to styles and types, 1810-1930, pages 37-41. Tuscaloosa, Alabama: The University of Alabama Press, 1990. . In the earlier or more fundamental examples one or two main rooms may open directly onto the porch. They often feature an interior chimney that pierces the ridge line of the roof, with back-to-back fireplaces serving two rooms. Two common secondary characteristics of this style are a raised basement and the frequent situating of the front of the buildings at the property line. In the city of New Orleans, the term Creole cottage tends to be more narrowly defined as a -story house with a gabled roof, the ridge of which is parallel to the street. The house normally has four squarish rooms with no hallways and is built up to the front property line. The primary difference between these cottages and those elsewhere is the lack of a full front porch. A similar house type that some architectural scholars believe is related to the Creole cottage is the Gulf Coast cottage. However, it is not clear if this type is derived from the Creole cottage or if it is a Deep South adaptation of a Tidewater-type cottage. They both display some of the general characteristics of a Creole cottage. In the more formal and later examples, a central hall is almost always present. These more formal examples began to appear in the 1820s and 1830s. They are typically larger with Federal or Greek Revival architectural influences not present in the simpler version. If a central hall is present, then usually it is entered via a central entrance. End-gable chimneys are often present rather than a central one.

With the adjacent village of Seisdon, it forms the civil parish of Trysull and Seisdon, within the South Staffordshire non-metropolitan district. Until 1974 it formed part of Seisdon Rural District. The 2011 census recorded a usually resident population for the parish of Trysull & Seisdon of 1,150 persons in 455 households. The village has not been greatly affected by over-modern development and still retains many of the old country cottages, houses and a manor house. Toponymy In 1086 the village name appears in the Domesday Book as Treslei. One of the families who subsequently occupied the estate were styled de Tressell. The name appears to mean \\"the settlement in the clearing\\", deriving from the Welsh prefix tre settlement and the suffix leah a woodland clearing. The next significant placename to the north is Trescott, where the suffix cott means small building or cottage. Ogilby's strip road map c1675 shows the spelling Tressell. Yates' map of Staffordshire, from 1775, shows the spelling Treosle. Topography and geology The village of Trysull lies almost entirely within the shallow valley of the Smestow Brook, flanked either side by low sandstone ridges running north-south. The Smestow itself created neither of these features: it simply flows through a landscape opened up by glaciation in the last Ice Age. A thin mantle of glacial drift covers the bedrock and consists of patches of clay, silt and pebble beds. Also present are scattered granite boulders originating either in Southern Scotland or North Wales.

The feudal estates of Trysull and the nearby village of Seisdon are Anglo-Saxon in origin and lay within the Seisdon Hundred. This administrative body met in the open, probably in the fields known as the \\"Musters\\". The estates were held by the Saxon Turgot immediately prior to the Conquest. For much of its history, as today, Trysull and Seisdon jointly formed a parish. The earliest recorded evidence for Trysull is an entry in the Domesday Book of 1086. A contemporary reworking of the original text records that: > William holds 2 hides (about 240 acres) in Trysull and Baldwin holds it from > him. Tirgot held it, with full jurisdiction, he was a freeman. Land for 3 > ploughs. In the estate 2 ploughs, 5 slaves, 4 villagers and 1 small holder > with 2 ploughs. A mill valued at 4 shillings and 4 acres of meadow. The > value was and is now 30 shillings. Following the Conquest the two estates were held \\"in captive\\" by William Fitz Ansculf and subsequently tenanted by local families. Sub-tenants were at first styled Frankley or Bradley, and later Tressell, from the name of the village. A fair and a market were granted by Henry III in 1251 to Thomas de Tressell. By 1396 the manor had passed to the Lowes, lords of Whittington (Worcestershire). By 1557 it had passed to Thomas Grey of Enville, who bought the neighbouring village of Seisdon in that year. The estate was bought by Sir Hugh Wrottesley in 1633, the ownership passed slowly into other hands, the last portion being sold in 1929. The open field system of farming ended in Trysull by mid-17th century following private enclosure acts and the exchange of common pasture with the Vicar of Wombourne in lieu of hay tithe. Various mediaeval routes can still be seen in the village. Both the track, Church Lane, from Trysull to Seisdon, and the green lane track, which backs on to various properties in the village centre, have evidence of long term use. Others, like Trysull Holloway, have been built over and are in modern-day use, but both their curving routes and some historic (possibly mediaeval) stone walling systems indicate ancient origins. The indirect routes taken suggest the need to bypass long-demolished mediaeval buildings no longer visible above ground. =Turnpike= The road along the southern boundary of the village was operated by the Dudley and New Inn Turnpike Trust from 1790. There was a toll house, toll gate and a turnpike gatekeeper at Smestow Gate, with a side-bar to Trysull and Seisdon. The turnpike ran from Dudley, Worcestershire to New Inn, Monmouthshire. The Local Government Act 1888 gave responsibility for maintaining main roads to the county council. This section of the road is now the B4176. =Railway= Large-scale Victorian industrial development largely by-passed the village. The Staffordshire & Worcestershire Canal passed about a quarter of a mile to the east of the parish boundary. However, it could have been very different if plans by the Welch and Midland Counties Junction Railways had come to fruition. In The London Gazette of 25 November 1862 a notice appeared announcing the intention to apply for an Act of Parliament to build and maintain a railway between the Shrewsbury and Hereford Railway at Craven Arms, the West Midland and South Staffordshire Railways at Dudley and Wolverhampton. Three sections of the line would have been: > No. 2. A railway, commencing in the said parish of Oldbury, from and out of > the intended railway No. 1, at or near the termination of that railway, as > before described, and terminating in the parish of Trysull, in the county of > Stafford, at a point in the centre of the public highway leading from the > Dudley and New Inn turnpike road at Smestow toll gate to Seisdon, situate > 135 yards or thereabouts from the tollhouse at the said tollgate, measuring > in a northerly direction along the said highway. > > No. 3. A railway, commencing in the said parish of Trysull, from and out of > the said intended Railway No. 2, at or near the termination of that railway > as before described, and terminating in the parish of Dudley, in the county > of Worcester, at or near Scot's-green, at a point in the centre of the > Dudley and Brettell-lane turnpike-road, situate 33 yards or thereabouts from > the weighing machine in the said road belonging to the Right Honourable the > Earl of Dudley, and occupied by his lordship. > > No. 7. A railway, commencing in the parish of Trysull, in the. county of > Stafford, from and out of the said intended Railway No. 2, at or near the > termination of that railway and the commencement of the said intended > Railway No. 3, as before respectively described, and terminating in the > parish of Sedgley, in the same county, by a junction with the Birmingham, > Wolverhampton, and Stour Valley Railway, about 10 yards to the south-east of > the point where such last-mentioned railway is carried over the turnpike- > road leading from Goldthorn-hill to Bilston, and near to Ettingshall-road > and Bilston Station, on such last-mentioned railway. Similarly, the Central Wales and Staffordshire Junction Railway (1864) and the Bridgnorth, Wolverhampton and Staffordshire Railway (1865) also planned to link main line Shropshire and Black Country networks via the Smestow Valley at Trysull. =Mander family= The architectural character of the historic centre of the village was significantly influenced in the late 19th and early 20th centuries by the activities and benefaction of Benjamin Howard Mander, who bought the Manor House in 1894 and lived there until his death in 1912. His widow Lilian continued to reside in Trysull until her own death in 1952.Varnished Leaves: a biography of the Mander Family of Wolverhampton 1750-1950, Nicholas Mander, published: Owlpen Press, 2004 The Manor House, Seisdon Road, Trysull The considerable wealth of the Mander family began to grow following the migration of Thomas Mander from the family’s farmland on the Warwickshire-Worcestershire border to the market town of Wolverhampton in the mid-1700s. By 1845, Mander Brothers had become a formidable industrial force in the area with a range of chemical and industrial businesses. The success of their paint and varnish business in the second half of the 19th century earned them a national reputation. The family were noted non- conformists, major philanthropists and local benefactors, and were regarded by their contemporaries as being progressive and public spirited. The Mander family, including Howard, were strongly influenced by the Arts and Crafts movement. They were responsible for building two great Arts and Crafts houses in the area, Wightwick Manor of 1889–93 on the western edge of Wolverhampton for Theodore Mander and The Mount at Tettenhall Wood in 1891 and 1908 for Sir Charles Tertius Mander. Immediately after his purchase of Trysull Manor House in 1894, Howard Mander commenced its remodelling, transforming it into an exemplar for the Arts and Crafts movement. By 1900, or soon after, he had endowed the village with an institute (now The Thatchers) complete with a billiards room and library. It was lost to the people of the village when the deed of gift was lost or misplaced. He also built neighbouring housing along Trysull Holloway and the fine Manor Farm. He influenced the design of the new school building in 1896, although he was not its principal benefactor. =20th century= The two 11th-century hamlets grew slowly; until prior to 1914 the parish was self-contained with a parish church, church hall, public houses, shops, a bakery, two post offices, two corn mills, blacksmiths, wheelwrights, boot and shoe makers, friendly societies, a sprinkling of professional people and a few \\"gentry\\". These were several small charities for the relief of the poor, now merged into the Thomas Rudge Educational Trust and the Parish Charity. The historic centre of Trysull was designated a Conservation Area in December 1969 by Staffordshire County Council. A more comprehensive study was made in December 2003 and January 2004 for South Staffordshire Council. This was published in an appraisal of the existing Conservation Area with recommendations for the future, in March 2004. After consideration and consultation a revised village Conservation Area, with its own detailed Management Plan and Appraisal was published. This was designated on 11 November 2010 and the changed boundary and Management Plan came into immediate effect. It was also felt appropriate to conjoin portions of Seisdon to the revised original areas. Both hamlets have strong historic and administrative links with their neighbour and are joined to them by a specially designated Buffer Zone. =Parish Church= The Parish Church, All Saints, is a small ancient edifice. It is known that a church has stood on the present site for over 1000 years. All Saints CE Parish Church, Trysull The Tower is one of the oldest parts of the church dating from the 12th century. It was heightened and buttressed in the 15th century. The tower had extensive work undertaken on it in 1897 by specialist builders F.W. Simon of Edinburgh, to a design by the same architect that designed the school. The works included a new porch. Above the round tower arch at the west end of the nave area are The Royal Arms Of George III. Following the Restoration of the English monarchy in 1660 it was made compulsory to display the arms of the reigning monarch in all parish churches. During the 19th century the practice was discontinued. On the outside of the north wall is an ancient doorhead, now blocked off. It is possible that it is Norman and has been re-sited when the north aisle was widened. It was in use until the late 19th century. Notable internal features are the 13th-century font, the 15th-century piscina, the 16th-century rood screen and the Jacobean pulpit. The east window dating from 1340 has undergone some restoration. The saints in the left and right hand sections are predominantly of the original 14th-century glass. Inside the main door is a parish chest, believed to date from the late 12th century, hewn out of one tree trunk and banded with iron. It was padlocked in two places; one key was held by the priest and the other by a church warden. The church was enlarged, and restored, in 1844,History, Gazetteer and Directory of Staffordshire, William White, Published Sheffield, 1851 at a cost of £1,000. It had 400 sittings of which 180 were free. =Woodford Grange= Track to Woodford Grange, building visible in distance The mediaeval monastic farming centre at Woodford Grange was an extra-parochial area on the south-eastern edge of the village. It was a farming centre for the Cluniac priory at Dudley. In a mediaeval context the grange place name normally denotes a monastic farm. It may be that Woodford Grange was central to an estate owned by the priory, and therefore some of the fields around Trysull would have been part of that estate as well. Not much is known about the links between Trysull and Woodford Grange in the medieval period and after the Dissolution of the Monasteries. However following the introduction of the New Poor Law, extra-parochial areas were effectively made civil parishes by the Extra-Parochial Places Act 1857 and were eliminated by the Poor Law Amendment Act 1868. In the case of Woodford this would have been achieved by being integrated with the neighbouring parish of Wombourne. A surviving associated feature is Monk's Path. Woodford Grange is currently privately owned. =School= All Saints CE (VC) Primary School, the current buildings on The Green. Trysull children had schooling as early as the 1680s although the first purpose-built schoolroom did not appear until somewhat later. The school was originally opened in 1703 and was situated somewhere opposite the parish church. By the mid-19th century, Trysull School was the building immediately adjacent to the School House. In 1895 a severe gale blew down the main chimney, destroying part of the roof and causing other considerable damage. Using a bequest of nearly £3,000 from Eliza Baker of Bromsgrove (formerly of Seisdon), work was started on the present school building which opened in 1896, a short distance from its predecessor.All Saints’ Church of England (Voluntary Controlled) Primary School, Trysull. School Prospectus 2009 to 2010 The building design, commissioned by the Mander family, was carried out by noted Arts and Crafts style architect Frank Worthington Simon. Drawings are held in the RIBA Archive at the Victoria & Albert Museum. =The Green= Until the 1840s the village green was known as Bent Green.England Census, Staffordshire, Trysull. The National Archives, 1841 =Workhouse= The original poorhouse for Trysull was based on The Green and was in use by the 1770s but was derelict by the 1840s. On 10 February 1859 the Birmingham Daily Post reported that \\"On Tuesday last, at the ordinary meeting of the Board of Guardians, Lord Wrottesley in the chair, the contract for the erection of the new workhouse for the Seisdon Union was signed. The site is on an eminence overlooking the village of Trysull. The contractor for the work is Mr. Heveningham, and it will be carried out under the superintendence of Mr. Bidlake.\\" The new Seisdon Poor Law Union workhouse was erected at Awbridge, to the north-east of Trysull, to accommodate 120 inmates, but with enlargement this number rose to 350. The boardroom also served as the Chamber for Seisdon Rural District Council. After its closure in the 1930s, some parts of the building were used by local businesses, including an egg packing station in World War II through to the 1960s, but the buildings were largely destroyed following a fire in 1964. The Seisdon Union also opened a children’s home in Vine Cottage on the south side of The Green in 1918. In 1871 Vine Cottage had been the Vine Inn, although it is not clear how long it operated as an inn.England Census, Staffordshire, Trysull. The National Archives, 1871 Today, this is the residential nursing home Woodford House. =Mill= Trysull Mill View from the bridge over Smestow Brook There is an old red-brick water mill close to the bridge over the Smestow Brook. Originally owned by Lord Wrottesley, it dates from 1854 and was one of the first buildings to feature an iron frame. It has a cast-iron water wheel with iron axle and paddles by G. and R. Turton of Kidderminster. The site also had a bakery. The village has had a mill since Saxon times and one was recorded in the Domesday Book however this was probably located further downstream. =Village Hall= The Little Green and Village Hall Trysull & Seisdon Village Hall was originally built for the Women’s Institute in the 1930s. The hall was leased to Trysull & Seisdon Parish Council on 18 October 1977 for a period of 99 years. Trysull & Seisdon Village hall was established as a charity by a Trust Deed dated 5 June 1984. The village hall management committee is responsible for keeping the building in a good state of repair. By mid-2008 the Village Hall had reached a sorry, dilapidated state both inside and out. Inside it was cold, damp and an environmental nightmare costing a fortune to run. In 2009 the hall was closed for 2 months to carry out energy efficiency improvements and to extensively repair and enhance the building and site. The hall was reopened in September 2009 after repairs and improvements totalling nearly £60,000. Adjacent to the Village Hall is the little green, a small and characterful grassed triangle formed by the junction of two roads. In the centre is a large oak tree, which as the inscription on a nearby stone attests, was planted to commemorate the coronation of King Edward VII, dated 9 August 1902, Coronation Day. =Playing Fields= The earliest sporting record is a cricket match between Trysull & Seisdon and a Bridgnorth team in 1858. There has been a cricket field in at least four locations in the parish over the years. Founded in 1951 the Playing Fields were created to provide permanent facilities for outdoor sport, including cricket and football along with a dedicated children's playground. A cedar wood clad prefabricated pavilion was provided in the mid-1960s, erected by local volunteers. This was destroyed by fire and replaced in 1984 with a brick-built structure still in use today.

It is probably the most controversial of Stormwitch's albums and poorly received by fans due to its almost entirely different sound, with progressive elements and very little of their classic heavy metal styles. It also marked the end of their original span which has lasted from 1982-1994. The album was the first to feature only one guitarist, making a four-member band. The album is a concept album, based on James Clavell's novel; Shōgun. The lyrics all revolve around parts from the novel referring to both names and places.

The accident caused a fireball to explode over 1,000 feet into the sky. The cars were carrying several hazardous materials that resulted in an evacuation of the immediate area. The derailment was determined to be the largest in Kentucky's history. The responders to the accident were Zoneton Fire Protection District and several Louisville fire districts. The residents affected by the accident reached a settlement with the rail company.crash information site On March 30, 2012, the National Transportation Safety Board released their conclusion regarding the probable cause: :The National Transportation Safety Board determines that the probable cause of the accident was the failure of the 18th rail car to properly negotiate a curve because of the inadequate side bearing clearance of the B-end truck assembly, likely due to a broken side bearing wedge plate attachment bolt, which caused a wheel to climb the rail, which derailed the car. Contributing to the derailment was (1) the undesirable contact of the truck bolster bowl rim with the car body center plate and (2) the hollow worn wheels on the 18th car, which further diminished the steering ability of the truck assembly.

He is the son of John and Margaret MacKay and an alumnus of Santa Fe High School and of the University of Minnesota. Early experience at The Santa Fe Opera MacKay, a French horn player, joined the orchestra of the Santa Fe Opera (SFO) at age 17. He was a volunteer with Santa Fe Opera at age 15, and began to work in administrative capacities with SFO at age 18. He worked at SFO as an orchestra librarian, in the business office and painting stage scenery.Miller, Sarah Bryan, \\"Opera Theatre’s Charles MacKay will take the helm at Santa Fe Opera\\". St. Louis Post-Dispatch, 9 November 2007. Subsequently with SFO, MacKay also held several administrative positions, including box office manager, assistant orchestra manager and business manager, the last position for 4 years. Spoleto Festival After leaving Santa Fe, his other administrative positions include a 6-year tenure as director of finance and administration for the Spoleto Festival USA, from 1978 to 1984. For 5 years, he was the manager for the American artists at the Festival of Two Worlds in Spoleto, Italy. Opera Theatre of Saint Louis In 1984, MacKay became executive director of Opera Theatre of Saint Louis (OTSL), recruited to the post by OTSL's first general director Richard Gaddes. In 1985, MacKay was named OTSL's second general director. During his tenure, MacKay presided over the growth of OTSL's endowment from USD $682,000 to $18 million, and maintained the company's record of never posting a deficit. He also raised funds for the construction of the Sally S. Levy Opera Center, the company's first permanent administrative facility, which was completed in 2006. Return to The Santa Fe Opera In November 2007, SFO named MacKay as its third general director, succeeding Richard Gaddes and John Crosby. He concluded his OTSL tenure on 30 September 2008, and began his tenure as SFO general director on 1 October of that year. His immediate challenges were financial, in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis. In 2010 and subsequent seasons, MacKay has brought several significant works to Santa Fe which had never been performed there. They included The Tales of Hoffmann (2010), Faust (2011), and in 2012 alone, The Pearl Fishers, Rossini's Maometto II (in a new critical edition) and Karol Szymanowski's King Roger. In 2013, Rossini's La donna del lago received its Santa Fe premiere in a co-production with the Metropolitan Opera. The 2014 season saw the first Santa Fe production of Beethoven's Fidelio. Additionally, MacKay's tenure has been characterized by working in collaboration with several opera companies across the United States on co-productions, some of which have been US or world premieres of new operas. In addition to the Met, these companies have included Minnesota Opera (Strauss' Arabella in 2012) and Opera Philadelphia (the Morrison / Cox Oscar in 2013). SFO presented five world premieres during MacKay's tenure, including Cold Mountain (opera) by Jennifer Higdon (2015) and The (R)evolution of Steve Jobs by Mason Bates (2018). MacKay was responsible for the recruitment first of Frédéric Chaslin, and later Harry Bicket, to the post chief conductor of the company. In August 2017, Santa Fe Opera announced MacKay's intention to step down as its general director after the 2018 season. In October 2018, Robert K. Meya began his tenure as general director of the company. Other achievements MacKay is a 1997 recipient of the Arts Management Career Service Award.

Dinbergs assumed the highest diplomatic post, that of chargé d'affaires, in 1970 and represented Latvia's sovereign interests in exile until Latvia reestablished its independence in 1991. As head of the Latvian diplomatic service abroad, Dinbergs was appointed Latvia's first ambassador to the United Nations and subsequently Latvia's first ambassador to the United States. After retirement, he served as Counselor to the Latvian Embassy in Washington, D.C., until his death in 1993.  Background and career  With the upheavals of the Latvian War of Independence, the Dinbergs family fled Latvia, living as refugees in Vitebsk from 1914-1918.\\"Anatols DINBERGS\\", retrieved March 27, 2008 Returning to a newly independent Latvia, Dinbergs' father, Alfrēds (1878–1941), was hired in 1919 as an engineer in Latvian Railways' technical directorate, later promoted to head its maintenance division. As a candidate for parliament, he was also elected to the Saeima from 1931–1934, representing the Railroad Workers' Association. Anatols Dinbergs graduated from the Riga State Gymnasium No.1, from the French Institute, and obtained his degree in law from the University of Latvia. Dinbergs entered service in Latvia's Foreign Ministry in 1932 while still completing his studies. His first post abroad was a junior position at the consulate in Łódź, Poland, from 1933 to 1934. From 1934 to 1935, he worked as correspondence secretary for the Western and Legal sections. In June 1937, he was appointed as assistant to the secretary in Latvia's New York consulate and promoted to attaché in September of that year. Dinbergs declined to return home after the Soviet invasion of Latvia in June 1940 and was subsequently relieved of his duties by the Latvian SSR. With the emergency vesting of Latvian sovereign authority in the chief of the Latvian diplomatic service, Kārlis Zariņš (Charles Zarine) in London, the Latvian diplomatic corps continued to function in exile. U.S. envoy Alfreds Bīlmanis, head of the Washington, D.C., consulate, promoted Dinbergs to vice consul in September 1940, then transferred Dinbergs to Washington, D.C., in 1941, where he served as diplomatic attaché and head of the consular section. After the death of Bīlmanis, Dinbergs served as chargé d'affaires ad interim from July 1948 to June 28, 1949, when Kārlis Zariņš formally appointed Julijs Feldmanis to the post of chargé d'affaires of Latvia. Dinbergs continued on as first secretary. Upon Feldmanis' death in 1953, Dinbergs again served as chargé d'affaires ad interim until Arnolds Spekke assumed the position of chargé d'affaires of Latvia in 1954.James T. McHugh, James S.

Dinbergs succeeded Spekke on October 1, 1970Countries L upon Spekke's retirement (Spekke died in 1972). Dinbergs became general consul to the United States in March 1971. Later that year, on September 17, the Latvian diplomatic corps met in Paris and unanimously elected Dinbergs chief of Latvia's diplomatic service. Dinbergs led Latvia's diplomatic service as chargé d'affaires until the restoration of Latvia's independence. The Latvian Legation in 1940-1991 did not maintain any contacts with the foreign ministry of the Latvian SSR. It received its first visitors from Latvia (representatives of Latvian Popular Front) in December 1988. After the independence declaration of May 4, 1990, Dinbergs established unofficial contacts with the new leadership of Latvia. That year he also arranged for the visit to the U.S. by Latvian prime minister Ivars Godmanis and foreign minister Jānis Jurkāns. In the spring of 1991, a working arrangement was agreed to among the Latvian foreign ministry, the legation in Washington, D.C., and the unified foreign diplomacy service which had been formed. At Dinbergs' initiative, a policy meeting was held in Washington, D.C., on April 14–15, also attended by Jurkāns. The legation in Washington, D.C., played a key role in January and August 1991 when Dinbergs, together with Estonian and Lithuanian diplomats, apprised the U.S. State Department of the course of events in the Baltic states and their drive to independence. On August 21, 1991, the day Latvia regained its independence, he dispatched a telegram to Riga, congratulating the government on its \\"declaration of renewed State independence based upon the foundation of the 1922 Constitution,\\" promising an even closer partnership between the legation in Washington, D.C., and the parliament and Council of Ministers to achieve their common goals. Symbolizing that partnership, acting Latvian president Anatolijs Gorbunovs visited the U.S. and United Nations Headquarters in September 1991. As of that September, Dinbergs was officially appointed both as head of Latvia's diplomatic service and as U.S. envoy. In a letter to the General Secretary of the United Nations of September 6, 1991, the Latvian government granted Anatols Dinbergs with plenipotentiary powers to represent the interests of the Latvian nation. Dinbergs was officially appointed on September 17, becoming Latvia's first Ambassador and Permanent Representative to the United Nations, having the honor of presiding over the first raising of Latvia's flag as a UN member. Dinbergs retired from his U.N. post that same year, on December 5, while continuing on in his positions of head of the diplomatic service and U.S. envoy. On September 18, 1991, the Latvian government had also petitioned the U.S government to promote the Legation to the highest rank of Embassy and to accept Dinbergs as Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary Ambassador. The U.S. acceded to the request, and so on March 11, 1992, Anatols Dinbergs submitted his credentials of accreditation to U.S. president George H. Bush. Bush expressed his particular happiness to see Dinbergs in this post, who for so long and so ably filled his duties, and that it was gratifying to work with such an eminent diplomat. Latvian diplomatic representation in U.S. during 1922-1948 had been vested in envoys, since the Latvian government only created the post of ambassador in 1991, Dinbergs thus became Latvia's first ever ambassador to the United States.Latvijas Vēstnesis For the most part, Dinbergs' appointees abroad, in the U.S., France, Great Britain, Canada, Australia, and Germany, continued on in their positions in Latvia's diplomatic and consular services.Latvijas Republikas Ārlietu Ministrija: Ieskats Latvijas ārlietu dienesta vēsturē Dinbergs retired from active diplomatic duties in December 1992 and continued to serve as Counselor to the Embassy until his death, on November 9, 1993.\\"ON GUARD FOR LATVIA'S STATEHOOD\\" Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Latvia, retrieved March 21, 2008 Dinbergs bequeathed his property to the Fraternitas Lettica, one of the oldest Latvian student fraternities, of which he was a member, to be used to fund a scholarship fund for Latvian students.

It asks the following question: If each box of a brand of cereals contains a coupon, and there are n different types of coupons, what is the probability that more than t boxes need to be bought to collect all n coupons? An alternative statement is: Given n coupons, how many coupons do you expect you need to draw with replacement before having drawn each coupon at least once? The mathematical analysis of the problem reveals that the expected number of trials needed grows as \\\\Theta(n\\\\log(n)). For example, when n = 50 it takes about 225E(50) = 50(1 + 1/2 + 1/3 + ... + 1/50) = 224.9603, the expected number of trials to collect all 50 coupons. The approximation n\\\\log n+\\\\gamma n+1/2 for this expected number gives in this case 50\\\\log 50+50\\\\gamma+1/2 \\\\approx 195.6011+28.8608+0.5\\\\approx 224.9619. trials on average to collect all 50 coupons. Solution=Calculating the expectation= Let T be the time to collect all n coupons, and let ti be the time to collect the i-th coupon after i − 1 coupons have been collected. Then T=t_1 + \\\\cdots + t_n. Think of T and ti as random variables. Observe that the probability of collecting a coupon is p_i = \\\\frac{n - (i - 1)}{n} = \\\\frac{n - i + 1}{n}. Therefore, t_i has geometric distribution with expectation \\\\frac{1}{p_i} = \\\\frac{n}{n - i + 1}. By the linearity of expectations we have: : \\\\begin{align} \\\\operatorname{E}(T) & {}= \\\\operatorname{E}(t_1 + t_2 + \\\\cdots + t_n) \\\\\\\\\\\\ & {}= \\\\operatorname{E}(t_1) + \\\\operatorname{E}(t_2) + \\\\cdots + \\\\operatorname{E}(t_n) \\\\\\\\\\\\ & {}= \\\\frac{1}{p_1} + \\\\frac{1}{p_2} + \\\\cdots + \\\\frac{1}{p_n} \\\\\\\\\\\\ & {}= \\\\frac{n}{n} + \\\\frac{n}{n-1} + \\\\cdots + \\\\frac{n}{1} \\\\\\\\\\\\ & {}= n \\\\cdot \\\\left(\\\\frac{1}{1} + \\\\frac{1}{2} + \\\\cdots + \\\\frac{1}{n}\\\\right) \\\\\\\\\\\\ & {}= n \\\\cdot H_n. \\\\end{align} Here Hn is the n-th harmonic number. Using the asymptotics of the harmonic numbers, we obtain: : \\\\operatorname{E}(T) = n \\\\cdot H_n = n \\\\log n + \\\\gamma n + \\\\frac{1}{2} + O(1/n), where \\\\gamma \\\\approx 0.5772156649 is the Euler–Mascheroni constant. Now one can use the Markov inequality to bound the desired probability: :\\\\operatorname{P}(T \\\\geq cn H_n) \\\\le \\\\frac{1}{c}. =Calculating the variance= Using the independence of random variables ti, we obtain: : \\\\begin{align} \\\\operatorname{Var}(T)& {}= \\\\operatorname{Var}(t_1 + \\\\cdots + t_n) \\\\\\\\\\\\ & {} = \\\\operatorname{Var}(t_1) + \\\\operatorname{Var}(t_2) + \\\\cdots + \\\\operatorname{Var}(t_n) \\\\\\\\\\\\ & {} = \\\\frac{1-p_1}{p_1^2} + \\\\frac{1-p_2}{p_2^2} + \\\\cdots + \\\\frac{1-p_n}{p_n^2} \\\\\\\\\\\\ & {} < \\\\left(\\\\frac{n^2}{n^2} + \\\\frac{n^2}{(n-1)^2} + \\\\cdots + \\\\frac{n^2}{1^2}\\\\right) \\\\\\\\\\\\ & {} = n^2 \\\\cdot \\\\left(\\\\frac{1}{1^2} + \\\\frac{1}{2^2} + \\\\cdots + \\\\frac{1}{n^2} \\\\right) \\\\\\\\\\\\ & {} < \\\\frac{\\\\pi^2}{6} n^2 \\\\end{align} since \\\\frac{\\\\pi^2}6=\\\\frac{1}{1^2}+\\\\frac{1}{2^2}+\\\\cdots+\\\\frac{1}{n^2}+\\\\cdots (see Basel problem). Now one can use the Chebyshev inequality to bound the desired probability: :\\\\operatorname{P}\\\\left(|T- n H_n| \\\\geq cn\\\\right) \\\\le \\\\frac{\\\\pi^2}{6c^2}. =Tail estimates= A different upper bound can be derived from the following observation. Let {Z}_i^r denote the event that the i-th coupon was not picked in the first r trials. Then: : \\\\begin{align} P\\\\left [ {Z}_i^r \\\\right ] \\\\le \\\\left(1-\\\\frac{1}{n}\\\\right)^r \\\\le e^{-r / n} \\\\end{align} Thus, for r = \\\\beta n \\\\log n, we have P\\\\left [ {Z}_i^r \\\\right ] \\\\le e^{(-\\\\beta n \\\\log n ) / n} = n^{-\\\\beta}. : \\\\begin{align} P\\\\left [ T > \\\\beta n \\\\log n \\\\right ] = P \\\\left [ \\\\bigcup_i {Z}_i^{\\\\beta n \\\\log n} \\\\right ] \\\\le n \\\\cdot P [ {Z}_1^{\\\\beta n \\\\log n} ] \\\\le n^{-\\\\beta + 1} \\\\end{align} Extensions and generalizations * Pierre-Simon Laplace, but also Paul Erdős and Alfréd Rényi, proved the limit theorem for the distribution of T. This result is a further extension of previous bounds. ::\\\\operatorname{P}(T < n\\\\log n + cn) \\\\to e^{-e^{-c}}, \\\\text{ as } n \\\\to \\\\infty. * Donald J. Newman and Lawrence Shepp gave a generalization of the coupon collector's problem when m copies of each coupon need to be collected. Let Tm be the first time m copies of each coupon are collected. They showed that the expectation in this case satisfies: ::\\\\operatorname{E}(T_m) = n \\\\log n + (m-1) n \\\\log\\\\log n + O(n), \\\\text{ as } n \\\\to \\\\infty. :Here m is fixed. When m = 1 we get the earlier formula for the expectation. * Common generalization, also due to Erdős and Rényi: ::\\\\operatorname{P}\\\\left(T_m < n\\\\log n + (m-1) n \\\\log\\\\log n + cn\\\\right) \\\\to e^{-e^{-c}/(m-1)!}, \\\\text{ as } n \\\\to \\\\infty. * In the general case of a nonuniform probability distribution, according to Philippe Flajolet, ::\\\\operatorname{E}(T)=\\\\int_0^\\\\infty \\\\left(1 - \\\\prod_{i=1}^n \\\\left(1-e^{-p_it}\\\\right)\\\\right)dt.

Prior to the primary election, Iraq war veteran Bryan Lentz agreed to drop his bid for the seat held by Weldon, instead running for a Pennsylvania state legislature seat, a move brokered by Governor Ed Rendell. Lentz had raised about $125,000 for his congressional campaign. Haverford Democrat Paul Scoles, who ran poorly funded race against Weldon in 2004, also backed out in early February, throwing his support behind Sestak.William Bender, \\"Dems revamp lineup card: It's Sestak vs. Weldon; Lentz vs. Gannon\\" , Delaware County Times, February 10, 2006 , covering the suburbs west of Philadelphia, was one of the districts where John Kerry outpolled Bush in the 2004 election, which nonetheless elected a Republican to the House. As such, it became the target of Democratic strategists; in 2006 the Democrats fielded a much stronger and vastly better-funded challenger. On October 13, the media reported that Weldon and his daughter were being investigated by the FBIhttp://www.philly.com/mld/philly/15760138.htm for their involvement with two Russian energy companies and a Serbian company connected with Slobodan Milosevic. The investigation focuses on the lobbying firm Solutions North America owned and run by daughter Karen Weldon and local Republican operative Charlie Sexton, which was hired for $1 million, and whether Weldon was involved in obtaining the contracts or was lobbied by his daughter's firm. Three days later, FBI agents raided the home of Weldon's daughter, Karen, as well as five other locations of Weldon associates in Pennsylvania and Florida as part of the investigation.Maryclaire Dale, \\"FBI raids home of Weldon's daughter, friend in influence probe\\" , Associated Press, October 16, 2006. On October 17, 2006, The Philadelphia Inquirer reported that Weldon \\"acknowledged yesterday that he was under investigation.\\" On October 13, 2006, CQPolitics changed their rating on the race, from \\"Leans Republican\\" to the highly competitive \\"No Clear Favorite.\\" This was the second time CQPolitics changed its rating in the match-up; in July, it reclassified the race from \\"Republican Favored\\" to the more competitive \\"Leans Republican.\\" They subsequently noted, however, that this change was made the day before the media reported that the FBI was investigating Weldon and his daughter. Shortly after the raid, CQPolitics.com changed their rating on this race for a third time, this time from \\"No Clear Favorite\\" to \\"Leans Democratic\\". On October 6, 2006, the non- partisan Cook Political Report re-rated the race from \\"Lean Republican\\" to the more competitive \\"Toss Up.\\" Larry Sabato's Crystal Ball, in late June, rated as one of the top thirty most competitive House races in the nation. Sabato has said that \\"Weldon has deep roots in this district, but his persistence on the issue of finding weapons of mass destruction in Iraq has struck more than several observers as unusual.\\" =8th Congressional district9th Congressional district10th Congressional district= The 2006 Pennsylvania 10th congressional district election was held on November 7 to elect a representative from the . Republican four-term incumbent Don Sherwood was defeated by Democrat Chris Carney, a former Defense Department consultant and Navy lieutenant commander. CQPolitics noted that \\"[a]t the outset of the 2006 midterm campaign cycle, it would have been difficult to identify a more politically 'safe' member than Pennsylvania Rep. Don Sherwood. A four-term Republican from the strongly conservative 10th District in northeastern Pennsylvania, Sherwood had run unchallenged by Democrats in 2002 and 2004.\\" But, he \\"enters the general election campaign in a weakened position mostly because of his extramarital relationship with a young woman, to which he publicly admitted last year. Sherwood, though, adamantly denied the woman’s charges that he also physically abused her. A lawsuit brought by the woman against Sherwood was later settled.\\" On May 15, 2006, Sherwood survived a \\"surprisingly strong challenge\\" in the Republican primary from Kathy Scott, a political newcomer. Sherwood received 56% of the vote. CQPolitics reported that his \\"mediocre showing\\" could be attributed to the admitted affair. Scott did not file a report with the FEC, which indicates that she spent less than $5,000 in her campaign. His small margin of victory came despite the fact that, prior to the primary, Pennsylvania Senator Rick Santorum endorsed Sherwood and recorded an automated telephone call on Sherwood's behalf, as did President George W. Bush. Sherwood's continuing problems resulting from the extramarital affair and Carney's nationally famous ads about it (in which actual residents of the district accuse Sherwood of having \\"no family values\\"), as well as polls that showed him 7 to 9 points behind, compelled Sherwood to respond with a television ad in which he directly apologized to voters for the affair, denied the allegations of physical abuse, and promised to continue what he said was his effective representation of the district if the voters were to forgive and re-elect him. However, the initial 2005 news about Sherwood admitting to an affair and being accused of choking the woman as well as the well-recognized Carney ads, which were described by the Associated Press as \\"hard-hitting\\", stuck with Sherwood's name throughout the campaign. Fallout for Sherwood continued, including charges that he voted against an increase in the minimum wage while hiking his own congressional income, a claim which the Congressman denounced as \\"bullshit\\", and for voting for the Central American Free Trade Agreement, which Carney said \\"sent Pennsylvanian jobs overseas.\\" Sherwood fought back by labeling Carney a \\"liar\\" for the minimum wage charges and subsequently accused Carney of being a \\"liberal\\" for supposedly supporting tax increases. Carney shot back, accusing Sherwood of supporting tax cuts for the wealthy, while depriving the middle- class. Carol Sherwood, the Congressman's wife, wrote a letter to registered Republicans in the 10th District in which she lambasted Carney as someone who \\"gets some pleasure out of hurting our family\\" and stated that \\"I am certainly not condoning the mistake Don made, but I am not going to dwell on either.\\" Simultaneously, President Bush made a visit to the area in October to Keystone College in La Plume Township, Pennsylvania to endorse Sherwood's run, a move which many believe might have hurt Sherwood when given Bush's declining popularity both nationwide and in the district. Bush supported Sherwood as \\"the right man to represent this district\\", to which the President drew uncertain applause from the audience, which included several empty tables. Coincidentally, Bush had deemed the week that he flew to Pennsylvania to help Sherwood as \\"National Character Counts Week\\", which propelled Carney to blast Bush as a hypocrite, stating he could not comprehend how President Bush could both endorse moral values and campaign for the affair-laden Sherwood in the same week. Simultaneously, Sherwood's campaign took a boost from a local newspaper, Times Leader, which ran a front-page headline in late October in which it accused Carney of \\"misrepresenting\\" quotes that were included in a Times Leader editorial page about Sherwood's extramarital affair. Meanwhile, Carney took pages from the Republican playbook by using the same tactics the GOP uses against Democrats to attack Sherwood, accusing the Congressman of having a \\"pre-9/11 mentality\\" on port security and of supporting amnesty for illegal immigrants, referring to President Bush's guest worker program for illegal immigration. Despite endorsements from Vice President Cheney, President Bush, and U.S. Senator Rick Santorum, Sherwood's campaign was surprisingly beaten in the financial spending wars by the Carney campaign. In the closing days of the campaign, last-minute news about new developments in a 2005 $500,000 deal with Sherwood's former mistress and accuser helped boost Carney, who had consistently played the trump card of \\"honor\\", \\"integrity\\", and \\"family values\\" in his campaign. Many voters also resonated with Carney's vague yet inspiring vow \\"to make Pennsylvania proud\\", a slogan that became very familiar to the 10th District, as well as his impressive record as a senior terrorism advisor in the Pentagon and his Navy service. =11th Congressional district12th Congressional district13th Congressional district14th Congressional district15th Congressional district16th Congressional district17th Congressional district18th Congressional district19th Congressional district=See also * United States congressional delegations from Pennsylvania * 108th United States Congress References Category:2006 Pennsylvania elections 2006 Pennsylvania Category:Joe Sestak ","title":"2006 United States House of Representatives elections in Pennsylvania"},{"id":"14721811","text":"\\"Mystiko\\" (; \\"Secret\\") is a single by the Greek singer Peggy Zina.

Brett also commanded the third-rate at the First Battle of Cape Finisterre in May 1747 during the War of the Austrian Succession. He commanded on the North America and West Indies Station during the Seven Years' War and later became Senior Naval Lord. He was also a Member of Parliament, representing the constituency of Queenborough from 1754 until 1774. Naval career=Early career= Born the son of Peircy Brett, a master in the navy, Brett joined the Royal Navy as a volunteer in around 1725. Promoted to lieutenant on 6 December 1734, he was appointed to the fourth-rate . In July 1738 he transferred to the fifth-rate and later that year to , one of the ships which sailed under the then Commodore George Anson for the Pacific in September 1740. Burning the town of Paita, probably drawn by Brett himself In February 1741 Brett transferred to Anson's own ship, the fourth-rate , as second lieutenant, and in this capacity, he commanded the landing party which sacked and burned the town of Paita in November 1741. After the capture of the Spanish treasure ship \\"Nuestra Señora de Covadonga\\", Brett became first lieutenant. On 30 September 1743, Anson made him captain of the Centurion when Anson himself had to leave the ship for a time in Canton. Once the party returned to England, on the arrival of the Centurion at Spithead on 15 June 1744 the Admiralty refused to confirm Brett's promotion to post-captain, although they did give Brett a new commission as post-captain dated the day the ship anchored. However, on 29 December 1744 the original commission date (30 September 1743) was confirmed under a new Admiralty Board of which Anson was a member. During the Jacobite rising Brett saw action on the 9 July 1745, when as captain of the fourth-rate he exchanged fire with the French ships Elizabeth and the Du Teillay. The Du Teillay at the time was carrying Charles Edward Stuart to Scotland with supplies and funds to support his cause. The Lion suffered severe damage and had to give up the pursuit and Charles eventually landed at Eriskay. He transferred to the command of the third-rate in 1747 and commanded her at the First Battle of Cape Finisterre in May 1747 during the War of the Austrian Succession. In 1748, Anson's official version of his voyage round the World was published. As well as detailing the expedition, it contained a large amount of useful information for future navigators and with forty-two detailed charts and engravings most based on drawings by Brett. In 1752 Brett commanded the Royal Yacht Royal Caroline for a voyage conveying King George II to Germany, for which he was awarded a knighthood. He was appointed captain responsible for all Royal yachts in 1754, and elected as MP for Queensborough in the same year. A new 80-gun ship of the line, , was commissioned in January 1756. Brett was named as her first captain, bringing with him his choice of petty officers and foretopmen from the Royal yacht fleet. Despite her commissioning Cambridge required several months of fitting out for sea service and was still unseaworthy when war with France was declared in May 1756. Brett was forced to wait until December for Cambridge to be declared fit to put to sea, and then it was not until February 1757 that she was equipped with her full complement of cannon. Brett's orders were to join Admiral Edward Boscawen's Western Squadron protecting British interests on the North America and West Indies Station. Having finally put to sea he found that his ship was slow and top-heavy, with a tendency to heel over in strong winds. He was also forced to deal with widespread sickness among his crew. Disease spread so fast among the crew that Cambridge was forced to return to Plymouth after only one year at sea so that the sick could be discharged to local hospitals. On 5 November 1758 Brett was granted a new position as flag captain for Admiral Anson aboard the 100-gun . He resigned this commission ten days later and returned to his previous role as captain of the Royal yachts. =Flag officer= Brett was promoted to rear admiral in 1762. When peace was declared in 1764 Brett returned to service aboard Anson's old vessel Centurion, and was stationed in the Mediterranean. He was appointed to the Board of Admiralty as Senior Naval LordRodger, p. 51-52 in the Chatham ministry under Sir Edward Hawke in December 1766, holding office until 28 February 1770. He was promoted to vice admiral on 18 October 1770 and, having resigned his constituency of Queensborough in 1774, he was promoted to full admiral on 29 January 1778. He lived at the Clock House in Beckenham in Kent;Lysons, p. 305 he died on 14 October 1781 and was buried at St George's Church, Beckenham. Family Brett married Henrietta Colby; the couple had two sons, who died in infancy, and a daughter. ReferencesSources * *J. K. Laughton, Brett, Sir Peircy (1709–1781), rev.

PCR inhibition is the most common cause of amplification failure when sufficient copies of DNA are present. PCR inhibitors usually affect PCR through interaction with DNA or interference with the DNA polymerase. Inhibitors can escape removal during the DNA purification procedure by binding directly to single or double-stranded DNA. Alternatively, by reducing the availability of cofactors (such as Mg2+) or otherwise interfering with their interaction with the DNA polymerase, PCR is inhibited. In a multiplex PCR reaction, it is possible for the different sequences to suffer from different inhibition effects to different extents, leading to disparity in their relative amplifications. Types of inhibitors Inhibitors may be present in the original sample, such as blood, fabrics, tissues and soil but may also be added as a result of the sample processing and DNA extraction techniques used. Excess salts including KCl and NaCl, ionic detergents such as sodium deocycholate, sarkosyl and SDS, ethanol, isopropanol and phenol among others, all contribute via various inhibitory mechanisms, to the reduction of PCR efficiency. Quantifying extent of inhibition In order to try to assess the extent of inhibition that occurs in a reaction, a control can be performed by adding a known amount of a template to the investigated reaction mixture (based on the sample under analysis). By comparing the amplification of this template in the mixture to the amplification observed in a separate experiment in which the same template is used in the absence of inhibitors, the extent of inhibition in the investigated reaction mixture can be inferred. Of course, if any part of the inhibition occurring in the sample- derived reaction mixture is sequence-specific, then this method will yield an underestimate of the inhibition as it applies to the investigate sequence(s). Preventing PCR inhibition=Sample collection= The method of sample acquisition can be refined to avoid unnecessary collection of inhibitors. For example, in forensics, swab-transfer of blood on fabric or saliva on food, may prevent or reduce contamination with inhibitors present in the fabric or food. =DNA purification= Techniques exist and kits are commercially available to enable extraction of DNA to the exclusion of some inhibitors. =PCR reaction components= As well as methods for the removal of inhibitors from samples before PCR, some DNA polymerases offer varying resistance to different inhibitors and increasing the concentration of the chosen DNA polymerase also confers some resistance to polymerase-targeted inhibitors. For PCR based on blood samples, the addition of bovine serum albumin reduces the effect of some inhibitors on PCR.

It is an interdisciplinary subject as it uses tools from algebraic number theory, arithmetic geometry, algebraic geometry, model theory, the theory of finite groups and of profinite groups. Fields with finite absolute Galois groups Let K be a field and let G = Gal(K) be its absolute Galois group. If K is algebraically closed, then G = 1. If K = R is the real numbers, then :G=\\\\operatorname{Gal}(\\\\mathbf{C}/\\\\mathbf{R})=\\\\mathbf{Z}/2 \\\\mathbf{Z}. Here C is the field of complex numbers and Z is the ring of integer numbers. A theorem of Artin and Schreier asserts that (essentially) these are all the possibilities for finite absolute Galois groups. Artin–Schreier theorem. Let K be a field whose absolute Galois group G is finite. Then either K is separably closed and G is trivial or K is real closed and G = Z/2Z. Fields that are defined by their absolute Galois groups Some profinite groups occur as the absolute Galois group of non-isomorphic fields. A first example for this is :\\\\hat{\\\\mathbf{Z}}=\\\\lim_{\\\\longleftarrow}\\\\mathbf{Z}/n \\\\mathbf{Z}. This group is isomorphic to the absolute Galois group of an arbitrary finite field. Also the absolute Galois group of the field of formal Laurent series C((t)) over the complex numbers is isomorphic to that group. To get another example, we bring below two non-isomorphic fields whose absolute Galois groups are free (that is free profinite group). * Let C be an algebraically closed field and x a variable. Then Gal(C(x)) is free of rank equal to the cardinality of C. (This result is due to Adrien Douady for 0 characteristic and has its origins in Riemann's existence theorem. For a field of arbitrary characteristic it is due to David Harbater and Florian Pop, and was also proved later by Dan Haran and Moshe Jarden.) * The absolute Galois group Gal(Q) (where Q are the rational numbers) is compact, and hence equipped with a normalized Haar measure. For a Galois automorphism s (that is an element in Gal(Q)) let Ns be the maximal Galois extension of Q that s fixes. Then with probability 1 the absolute Galois group Gal(Ns) is free of countable rank. (This result is due to Moshe Jarden.) In contrast to the above examples, if the fields in question are finitely generated over Q, Florian Pop proves that an isomorphism of the absolute Galois groups yields an isomorphism of the fields: Theorem. Let K, L be finitely generated fields over Q and let a: Gal(K) → Gal(L) be an isomorphism. Then there exists a unique isomorphism of the algebraic closures, b: Kalg → Lalg, that induces a. This generalizes an earlier work of Jürgen Neukirch and Koji Uchida on number fields. Pseudo algebraically closed fields A pseudo algebraically closed field (in short PAC) K is a field satisfying the following geometric property. Each absolutely irreducible algebraic variety V defined over K has a K-rational point. Over PAC fields there is a firm link between arithmetic properties of the field and group theoretic properties of its absolute Galois group. A nice theorem in this spirit connects Hilbertian fields with ω-free fields (K is ω-free if any embedding problem for K is properly solvable). Theorem. Let K be a PAC field. Then K is Hilbertian if and only if K is ω-free. Peter Roquette proved the right-to-left direction of this theorem and conjectured the opposite direction. Michael Fried and Helmut Völklein applied algebraic topology and complex analysis to establish Roquette's conjecture in characteristic zero. Later Pop proved the Theorem for arbitrary characteristic by developing \\"rigid patching\\".

The centuries that followed the collapse, in western Europe, of the Roman empire was marked by a period of large scale migrations, and by the sixth century the Tragöß area was inhabited by Slavs, who made their homes not on the valley floors, but on the slopes that overlooked them. Bavarii and Franks followed in the ninth century, settling for the most part the fertile ground of the valley floors.

Christodoulos Tsigantes. It fought alongside the SAS in the Western Desert and the Aegean, as well as with General Leclerc's Free French Forces in Tunisia. It was disbanded in August 1945 but is the precursor of the modern Greek Special Forces. There is considerable variation in the translation of the unit's name into other European languages. It is perhaps most commonly referred to by British historians as the Sacred Brigade, even though it never reached anywhere near brigade strength, and occasionally as the Sacred Company, Sacred Squadron or Sacred Battalion. French military historians tend to refer to it as \\"Le Regiment Sacré\\". In contemporary Greek military parlance, a \\"lochos\\" is a company, but the unit's full strength was much closer to that of a regular infantry regiment. History= Establishment = Immediately after the German occupation of Greece in April–May 1941, the Greek government fled to Egypt and started to form military units in exile. The plethora of officers in relation to the number of ordinary soldiers, led Air Force Lt. Colonel G. Alexandris to suggest the creation of an Army unit, formed by officers, with soldier's duties. This suggestion was approved by the Commander of the II Greek Brigade, Infantry Colonel Alkiviadis Bourdaras. Some volunteers that fled firstly to Turkey were told that they would not be accepted if identified as soldiers. Therefore, according to reports they claimed to be Greek officers and later joined the original group of officers. Firemen were also reported in that group. Thus, in August 1942 the Company of Chosen Immortals () was formed under Cavalry Major Antonios Stefanakis in Palestine, with 200 men. Initially, the unit was organized as a Machine Gun Company and intended to be attached to the II Greek Brigade, then under formation. However, on September 15, 1942, the unit's new commander, Colonel Tsigantes, renamed the unit to \\"Sacred Band\\" after the Sacred Band of Thebes and the Sacred Band of the Greek Revolution, and successfully applied for its conversion into a special forces unit. = SAS Squadron = In close cooperation with the commander of the British SAS Regiment, Lt. Colonel David Stirling, and with the approval of the Greek HQ, the company moved to the SAS base at Qabrit in Egypt to begin its training in its new role. However, following the Second Battle of El Alamein, the speed of the Allied advance across Libya brought an end to the era of jeep-borne raiding. Nevertheless, this period provided a useful introduction to the SAS Regiment in general, and Major Jellicoe's squadron in particular. This squadron was being built upon the amphibious skills of the famous Commando unit, the Special Boat Section (SBS) and would become the Special Boat Squadron (SBS). With the end of the war in Africa, in May, the SAS split into two branches. The Special Raiding Squadron would serve in the central Mediterranean, before returning home to develop an airborne role, whilst the SBS would serve in the Aegean, operating alongside the Greek Sacred Squadron for the rest of the War. Both were later expanded to Regimental status. Meanwhile, the Greeks were keen to put their new jeep-borne role into practice. = First actions in Tunisia = On 7 February 1943, following Colonel Tsigantes' suggestion, the Commander of the British 8th Army, General Bernard Montgomery, put the Greek company under the command of General Philippe Leclerc de Hauteclocque of the Free French 2nd Armoured Division, with the duties of Light Mechanized Cavalry. On March 10, 1943, in the area of Ksar-Rillan in Tunisia, the Sacred Band gave its first battle against a German mechanized detachment, while covering the advance of the X British Army Corps that tried to by-pass the Mareth defence line from the South. Immediately after the Allied forces captured the Tunisian city of Gabès, the Sacred Company was detailed to the 2nd New Zealand Division (March 29) and on April 6, a mixed Greek-New Zealand detachment fought against the Germans at Wadi Akarit. On 12 April the Sacred Band entered Sousse, and participated in the battle for Enfidaville between April 13 and 17. = Commando actions in the Aegean = From May 1943, the Sacred Band, now composed of 314 men, moved to Palestine, in various camps. In July, it went to Jenin for parachute training. There it also underwent a reorganization into an HQ Section, a Base Section, and Commando Sections I, II and III. After the Italian armistice on 9 September 1943, British forces moved into the Italian-occupied, but Greek- inhabited Dodecanese islands. Section I of the Sacred Band was dropped by air to the Greek island of Samos on 30 October, while sections II and III moved there on fishing boats. With the failure of the campaign after the battle of Leros, however, Samos was evacuated, and the men of the Sacred Band withdrew to the Middle East. In February 1944, it was put under the command of the British Raiding Forces. On February 7, Section I moved for combat operations to the islands of the northern Aegean sea (Samos, Psara, Lesvos, Chios), while Section II moved to the Dodecanese with the same purpose. In April 1944, the Sacred Band was expanded to regimental size, with a strength of around 1,000 men. This reflected the unit's effectiveness, and, from a British standpoint, political reliability in the face of mounting political tensions among the Greek forces in exile. Along with the British SBS, the Sacred Band took part in the successful Raid on Symi in July 1944 in which the entire German garrison was either killed or captured. = The Dekemvriana, end of war and disbandment of the unit = After the Greek mainland was liberated (October 1944), the Sacred Band returned to Greece, where strains were becoming evident in the relationship of George Papandreou's British-backed national unity government and the leftist National Liberation Front (EAM), which controlled most of the Greek countryside. The crucial issue was the disarmament of the guerrilla forces and the formation of a new national army out of members of both the exiled armed forces and the guerrillas of ELAS and EDES. However, the Papandreou government wished to retain the Sacred Band and the 3rd Greek Rimini Mountain Brigade intact: faced with the far larger guerilla army of uncertain political intent, Papandreou and the British wished to keep these units and make them the core of the new army. Disbanding them would mean that their members would become individual recruits in a possibly EAM-dominated people's army. This tension eventually spilled over into the Dekemvriana events in Athens, where the Sacred Band fought against ELAS forces. Throughout October 1944, and then again from February 1945, after the fighting in Athens had ended, the Sacred Band continued operating against the remaining German garrisons in the islands of the Aegean Sea until the war's end in May 1945. In June, the unit returned to Egypt prior to its disbandment, which took place in a ceremony in Athens, on 7 August 1945. During the ceremony the unit's flag was awarded with Greece's highest military awards, the Commander's Cross of the Cross of Valour and the War Cross First Class. The unit's casualties throughout its existence amounted to 25 dead, 56 wounded, 3 missing and 29 taken prisoner. In the Greek Army, some of the Sacred Band's traditions are carried on by the Mountain Raiding Companies (LOK), founded in 1946. = British connections = As a unit operating under British direction, the Sacred Squadron and Regiment had British officers attached. Some were figures well known in military or other circles.

History Shepley, Rutan, and Coolidge depot picture on an early color postcard The original Brookline Hills station opened in 1852 on the Highland branch, which at the time was a conventional commuter rail line. After 1886, loop service was run via what is now the Framingham/Worcester Line and later the Needham Line. In March 1892, a new station designed by Shepley, Rutan and Coolidge was opened. The final trains on the line ran on May 31, 1958. The line was converted to light rail by the M.T.A. and Brookline Hills reopened on July 4, 1959, along with the rest of the D branch. The 1892 depot is no longer extant. =Accessibility= Construction at the station in December 2019 In the early 2000s, the MBTA modified key surface stops with raised platforms for accessibility. Brookline Hills was not among those initially outfitted with portable lifts, nor was it retrofitted with raised platforms. However, portable lifts were installed by 2003. Around 2006, the MBTA added wooden mini-high platforms on both platforms, allowing level boarding on older Type 7 LRVs. These platforms were installed at eight Green Line stations in 2006–07 as part of the settlement of Joanne Daniels-Finegold, et al. v. MBTA. The station is being renovated with fully accessible platforms as part of an expansion of Brookline High School, which includes a new school building partially over the eastern end of the platforms. Construction is expected to last from late 2019 to mid-2021.

However, it had a significant impact on Britain's policies both in the empire, as well as on her international relations. The outlines and plans for the nascent ideas of the conspiracy were noted and began to be tracked by the British intelligence as early as 1911. Alarmed at the agile organisation, which repeatedly reformed at different parts of the country despite being subdued in others, the chief of Indian Intelligence Sir Charles Cleveland was forced to warn that the idea and attempt at pan-Indian revolutions were spreading through India \\"like some hidden fire\\". A massive, concerted and coordinated effort was required to subdue the movement. Attempts were made in 1914 to prevent the naturalisation of Tarak Nath Das as an American citizen, while successful pressure was applied to have Har Dayal interned. The conspiracy had been detected early by British intelligence, and had been the subject of strong British pressure from 1914. Background World War I began with an unprecedented outpouring of loyalty and goodwill towards the United Kingdom from within the mainstream political leadership, contrary to initial British fears of an Indian revolt. India contributed massively to the British war effort by providing men and resources. About 1.3 million Indian soldiers and labourers served in Europe, Africa, and the Middle East, while both the Indian government and the princes sent large supplies of food, money, and ammunition. However, Bengal and Punjab remained hotbeds of anti-colonial activities. Terrorism in Bengal, increasingly closely linked with the unrests in Punjab, was significant enough to nearly paralyse the regional administration. Also from the beginning of the war, expatriate Indian population, notably from United States, Canada, and Germany, headed by the Berlin Committee and the Ghadar Party, attempted to trigger insurrections in India on the lines of the 1857 uprising with Irish Republican, German and Turkish help in a massive conspiracy that has since come to be called the Hindu–German Conspiracy This conspiracy also attempted to rally Afghanistan against British India. A number of failed attempts were made at mutiny, of which the February mutiny plan and the 1915 Singapore Mutiny remains most notable. This movement was suppressed by means of a massive international counter-intelligence operation and draconian political acts (including the Defence of India Act 1915) that lasted nearly ten years. Political impact The Conspiracy, judged by the British Indian Government's own evaluation at the time, and those of a number of contemporary and modern historians, was one of the most important events in the Indian independence movement and was one of the most significant threats to have faced the Raj in the second decade of the 20th Century. =In India= The conspiracy, especially in the scenario of the British war effort and the threat from the militant movement in India, was the major factor for the passage of the Defence of India Act 1915. Among the strongest proponents of the act was Michael O'Dwyer,then the Lieutenant Governor of Punjab, and this was largely due to the Ghadarite movement. It is now judged to have been the principal factor guiding British political concessions as well as Whitehall's India policy during and after World War I, including the passage of Montagu–Chelmsford Reforms. It has also been suggested by a number of historians that the events, especially in Punjab, in 1919 owed to a large extent to the Ghadarite movement or what was left of it, the presence of Pratap's Kabul mission in Afghanistan its overtures towards Bolshevik Russia, and the Raj's perception of its potential was a key factor, in spurring political progression in India. In 1917, the Montagu–Chelmsford Reforms initiated the first rounds of political reform in the Indian subcontinent. At the same time, a Sedition Committee chaired by Sydney Rowlatt, an English judge, was instituted in 1918 which evaluated the Indo- German-Ghadar link and the militant movement in India. On the recommendations of the committee, the Rowlatt Act, an extension of the Defence of India Act 1915, was enforced in response to the threat in Punjab and Bengal. 1919 was also the time that Indian troops were returning from the battlefields of Europe and Mesopotamia to find India far removed from the ideals they fought for, and in the midst of an economic and political stagnation. The attempts of mutiny in 1915 and the Lahore conspiracy trials were still in public attention. News of young Mohajirs who fought on behalf of the Turkish Caliphate and later fought in the ranks of the Red Army during the Russian Civil War also began reaching India at this time. The Russian Revolution had also cast its long shadow into India. It was also at this time that Gandhi, till then relatively unknown in the Indian political scene, began emerging as a mass leader. =Afghanistan= Ominously, in 1919, the Third Anglo-Afghan War began in the wake of Amir Habibullah's assassination and institution of Amānullāh in a system blatantly influenced by the Kabul Mission. In addition, in India, Gandhi's call for protest against the Rowlatt Act achieved an unprecedented response of furious unrest and protests. The situation especially in Punjab was deteriorating rapidly, with disruptions of rail, telegraph and communication system. The movement was at its peak before the end of the first week of April, with some recording that \\"Practically the whole of Lahore was on the streets, the immense crowd that passed through Anarkali was estimated to be around 20,000.\\" In Amritsar, over 5,000 people gathered at Jallianwala Bagh. This situation deteriorated perceptibly over the next few days. Michael O'Dwyer is said to have been of firm belief that these were the early and ill-concealed signs of a conspiracy of a coordinated uprising around May, on the lines of the 1857 revolt, at a time when the British troops would have withdrawn to the hills for the summer. The Amritsar massacre, as well as responses preceding and succeeding it, contrary to being an isolated incident, was the end result of a concerted plan of response from the Punjab administration to suppress such a conspiracy succeeding. James Houssemayne Du Boulay is said to have ascribed a direct relationship between the fear of a Ghadarite uprising in the midst of an increasingly tensed situation in Punjab, and the British response that ended in the massacre. Lastly, the British efforts to downplay and disguise the nature and impact of the revolutionary movement at this time also resulted in a policy designed to strengthen the moderatist movement in India, which ultimately saw Gandhi's rise in the Indian movement. International relations The conspiracy influenced a number of aspects of Great Britain's international relations, most of all the Anglo-American relations during the war, as well as, to some extent, the Anglo-Chinese relations. After the war, it was one of the issues that influenced Anglo-Japanese relations. =Anglo-US relations= By 1916, majority of the resources of the American department of the British Foreign office were related to the Indian seditionist movement. Before the outbreak of the war, Cecil Spring Rice, the Ambassador to United States at the time of the war, is known to resisted the British Foreign Office from making this a diplomatic issue. Spring-Rice's dispatches cite concerns with regards to American tolerance of the Anarchist movements in American soil, the American government's inactions despite concrete knowledge (in Spring-Rice's opinion) of the conspiracies, as well as concerns regarding the image of Britain in American public opinion if she is seen to persecute oppressed people. Further, Spring-Rice was particularly wary of the Wilson administration's political commitments, especially given that the United States Secretary of State William Jennings Bryan had authored eight years previously a pamphlet highly critical of the \\"British rule in India\\", which had been classified as seditionist by the Indian and Imperial governments. Following Bryan's departure, the Secretary of State for India, the Marquess of Crewe, attempted to persuade Spring-Rice to raise the issue in front of the United States government. American authorities in Philippines were also more cooperative at this time that assured Britain of for knowledge of any plans against Hong Kong. Following the conclusion of the Lahore Conspiracy Case trial, and as more evidence of German complicity came afore, Foreign Secretary Edward Grey was forced to override Spring-Rice's concerns. In February 1916, the concerns of the British government regarding the conspiracy and German complicity were officially presented to the American government. However, although the new Secretary of State, Robert Lansing, was initially as uncooperative as Bryan, the first investigations of the conspiracy opened with the raid of the Wall Street office of Wolf von Igel, seizing papers that were later presented as evidence in the Hindu–German Conspiracy Trial. To much chagrin of the British government, however, it was not pursued further at the time. The issue precipitated a more general Anglo-American neutrality dispute, aggravated by belligerent preventive measures taken by the British Far-Eastern fleet on the high seas that threatened the sovereignty of American vessels. The seizure of German and Turkish passengers from the American vessel China by HMS Laurentic at the mouth of the Yangtze River and the following argument by the British government that the seized planned to foment armed uprising in India provoked outrage from the American government, followed by a number of incidences including the SS Henry S incident. The U. S. Atlantic Fleet dispatched destroyers to the Philippines. The relations were strained when in May 1916, the British government decided to relax its aggressive policy and seek cooperation with the US. The China prisoners were released that month, but relations did not improve before November that year, with a number of exchanges through the rest of 1916. The issue was ultimately addressed by William G. E. Wiseman, head of British intelligence in the US, who passed on details of a bomb plot directly to the New York Police by passing diplomatic channels. This led to the arrest of Chandra Kanta Chuckrevarty. As the links between Chuckervarty papers and the Igel papers became apparent, the investigations by Federal authorities ultimately expanded to cover the entire conspiracy., with the US agreeing to pass on evidence so long as Britain did not seek admission of liability for Breaches of Neutrality. At a time that diplomatic relations with Germany were deteriorating, the Foreign office directed the Embassy to cooperate with the investigations. These ultimately resolved the Anglo-American diplomatic disputes just as America entered the war. =Sino-English and Anglo-Japanese relations= Through 1915-16, China (along with Indonesia) formed one of the major bases for the conspirators, and significant efforts were made by the British Government to coax China into the war to attempt to control the German and Ghadar intrigues. This would also allow free purchase of arms from China for the Entente powers. However, Yuan's proposals for bringing China into the war were against Japanese interests and gains from the war. This along with Japanese support for Sun Yat Sen and rebels in Southern China laid the foundations of deterioration of Anglo- Japanese relations as early as 1916. After the end of World War I, Japan increasingly became a haven for radical Indian nationalists in exile, who were protected by patriotic Japanese societies. Notable among these included Rash Behari Bose, Tarak Nath Das, A. M. Sahay as well as others. The protections offered to these nationalists effectively prevented British efforts to repatriate them and became a major policy concern. Indian Independence Committee The IIC was formally disbanded in November 1918, with most of its members becoming closely associated with Communism and the Soviet Union. Bhupendranath Datta and V. N. Chatterjee arrived in Moscow in 1920. Narendranath Bhattacharya, under a new identity of M. N. Roy was amongst the first Indian communists and made a memorable speech in the second congress of the Communist International that rejected Leninist thesis and foreshadowed Maoist peasant movements. Chatterjee himself was in Berlin till 1932 as the general secretary of the League Against Imperialism and was able to convince Nehru to affiliate Indian National Congress with the league in 1927.He later fled Nazi Germany for Soviet Russia but disappeared in 1937 under Stalin's Great Purge. Ghadar Party The Ghadar Party, suppressed during the war, revived itself in 1920 and openly declared its communist beliefs. Although sidelined in California, it remained relatively stronger in East Asia, where it allied itself with the Chinese Communist Party. Later efforts Although the conspiracy failed during World War I and the movement suppressed at the time with a number of its key leaders hanged or incarcerated, a number of prominent Ghadarites also managed to flee India to Japan and Thailand. The concept of a revolutionary movement for independence also found a revival amongst later generation Indian leaders, most notably Subhas Chandra Bose who, towards the mid-1930s began calling for a more radical approach towards colonial domination. During World War II, a number of these leaders were instrumental in seeking Axis support to revive such a concept. Bose himself, from the very beginning of World War II actively evaluated the concept of revolutionary movement against the Raj, interacting with Japan and subsequently escaping to Germany to raise an Indian armed force, the Indische Legion, to fight in India against Britain. He would later return to South East Asia to take charge of the Indian National Army which was formed following the labour of exiled nationalists, efforts from within Japan to revive a similar concept, and the direction and leadership of people like Mohan Singh, Giani Pritam Singh, Rash Behari Bose. The most famous of these saw the formation of the Indian Independence League, the Indian National Army and ultimately the Arzi Hukumat-e-Azad Hind in South East Asia.

(1992). Film Noir: An Encyclopedic Reference to the American Style (3rd ed.). Woodstock, New York: The Overlook Press. erotic thriller film directed by Abel Ferrara and starring Tom Berenger, Billy Dee Williams, Jack Scalia, and Melanie Griffith. The screenplay was written by longtime Ferrara collaborator Nicholas St. John. It is considered a cult film. The film follows a nightclub promoter (Berenger) and a police Detective (Williams), investigating a brutal serial killer targeting strippers in Manhattan. Plot Best friends Matt Rossi and Nicky Parzeno run a management company for Manhattan’s best exotic dancers, managing and booking their clients into clubs across the borough. Rossi was once in a relationship with their top client Loretta, but they broke it off due to his emotional coldness, by his accidentally killing an opponent in the ring during his days as a professional boxer. One night, one of their dancers is targeted by a brutal assailant who beats and mutilates her. Rossi and Parzeno immediately suspect rival promoter Lou Goldstein, but he vehemently denies any involvement. Vice Detective Al Wheeler is put on the case, displaying nothing but contempt towards Rossi and his colleagues and their occupation, and convinced that they know more than they’re letting on. Soon, more dancers are attacked, including Loretta’s lover Leila, leaving Rossi and Parzeno’s clients unwilling to work for fear of being targeted. Rossi and Loretta slowly begin to rekindle their relationship, while Wheeler begins to suspect that the attacks may not be gang-related, but instead the work of a single person. When another dancer is killed in her own apartment, Rossi and Parzeno’s business is left effectively destitute, with the majority of their clients refusing to work. Loretta begins a downward spiral into drug addiction after Leila dies of her injuries in the hospital. Rossi and Parzeno stalk and attack a man in one of their clubs, mistakenly believing he’s the killer, and drawing the ire of Wheeler in the process. While Matt is harshly interrogated by the Detective, Parzeno and his girlfriend Ruby are ambushed by the killer. They manage to fend him off long enough for help to arrive, but Parzeno is severely injured and hospitalized in the process. Hungry for vengeance and seeking guidance, Rossi visits a local mafioso named Carmine, with whom he built omerta many years ago when he witnessed him kill someone in a drive-by shooting. Carmine tells Rossi in no uncertain terms to find the assailant and kill him, and Rossi begins preparing himself for the inevitable encounter. When Loretta asks Ruby for money, Ruby gives her cab fare, and directs her to go straight home. However, Loretta takes the money to her dealer, where she discovers his body hanging in an alley. The attacker, laying in wait, stabs Loretta in the leg before Rossi arrives, and a fight ensues. Loretta goes for help as Matt takes several hits. When Matt exercises his boxing skills, he defeats the attacker. Police officers arrive to discover that Matt has beaten the man to death. Wheeler acknowledges Matt’s heroism, and sends him home with Loretta. Cast * Tom Berenger as Matt Rossi * Billy Dee Williams as Det.

Founded in 1977, it is housed on a converted coffee barge moored at Fulton Ferry Landing on the East River near the Brooklyn Bridge. History Olga Bloom founded Bargemusic in 1977, following the transformation of the coffee barge into a music hall in that same year, and the programming has evolved over time while not losing the intimacy of the performance space, which some compare to a floating living room. The barge itself dates to 1899. \\"Actually, we're practicing great economy of motion here,\\" said Bloom in 1990. \\"Water exerts a universal pull on humanity. People commune with nature here, to a degree. They even see a soaring seagull occasionally, and I have my scraggly, brave pines on the deck. We also offer an unmistakably warm social occasion. Our audiences are small - we can hold 140, but I usually try to cut off at 130 - so even though they don't know each other, they speak to each other readily during the intermissions. They are sharing values. And they are experiencing a noble performance of great music. All in one visit.\\" The current barge, 102-feet long and built in 1899, was the third that Bloom purchased for this use after the first two barges' acoustics did not suit concert performances. She found the current barge near the Statue of Liberty and a tugboat captain advised her of the free slip near the Brooklyn Bridge that still houses the barge. In 2003, a mishap with a pipe nearly caused the barge to sink. It took hundreds of gallons of water into its bilge when a pipe feeding water into it snapped due to freezing weather. Listing, it began taking on seawater through a crack in its side. A repair crew pumped more than 1,500 gallons of water out of the bilge before it started to level. Despite some uncertainties as to their location with all the redevelopment in Brooklyn Bridge Park and DUMBO, including the new NYC Ferry service, Bargemusic received word in June 2017 that their bid for a twenty year lease was approved. As of 2017, they're home to some two hundred performances each year under the leadership of Mark Peskanov, who has been involved since 2003. Funding Like many organizations in Lower Manhattan and throughout New York City, Bargemusic's attendance suffered after 9/11 and that caused questions about its continued existence. To make money, Bloom and Bargemusic have rented the barge out for weddings and solicited donations from foundations, corporations, and individuals. Some believe that if Bargemusic were given landmark status, it would help secure the necessary corporate sponsorship to ensure the program's continued success.

Biography Rodríguez Vega was born in Santander, Cantabria, Spain. Rodríguez Vega hated his mother because she had thrown him out of the house when Rodríguez Vega beat his father, who was terminally ill. In 'revenge' against his mother, Rodríguez Vega started his criminal career raping many women until 17 October 1978 when he was arrested and sentenced to a term of 27 years in prison. However, his behavior while in prison, and his ability to charm his victims into forgiving him led to a reduction in his sentence to 8 years. Released in 1986, Rodríguez Vega's wife left him. He did not take the breakup well, but eventually remarried, this time to a mentally disabled woman, who he tortured and humiliated, all the while keeping up the pretense of having an excellent marriage. He was considered to be a good person, a hardworking man and good husband to those around him. On 19 May 1988, Rodríguez Vega was arrested while walking on the street Cobo de la Torre in Santander, where he was sharing an apartment with María de las Nieves V.P (23 years old). After being arrested, he confessed to the murders. Crimes On 6 August 1987, Rodríguez Vega entered the home of Margarita González (82 years old), raped and suffocated her. He forced the woman to swallow her own false teeth. A few weeks later, on 30 September 1987, Carmen González Fernández (80 years old), was found dead in her home. Rodríguez Vega was accused of this murder. Soon after, in October, Rodríguez Vega killed Natividad Robledo Espinosa (66 years old), beating, raping and suffocating her. Rodríguez Vega did not kill again until 21 January 1988, when Carmen Martínez González was found dead in her home. On 18 April 1988 he killed Julia Paz Fernández (66 years old), who was also raped and suffocated. She was found naked. The other victims' identities were not released. Trial and sentence His trial began in November 1991 in Santander. At the time of his arrest, he had confessed to the murders but on trial he denied all charges against him and said that the women had died by natural causes. Rodríguez Vega was diagnosed as a psychopath who was a fastidiously neat individual. His killing was well organized in that he would first identify a victim, then observe her until he was familiar with every aspect of her routine. He would then make contact with the victim, try to gain her trust, using his charm and looks, until he gained access to her home, often under the guise of doing work to or around her home. He was described as a cold-hearted and calculating serial killer who took mementos from each of his kills. When he was arrested, police found a red room where he displayed his mementos, which ranged from a television to a bouquet of plastic flowers. Because of the age of his victims, some of their deaths were attributed to natural causes. The extent of his killing spree was not realized until police released a videotape of his home, showing his mementos. Families of the victims identified objects that linked Rodríguez Vega to their dead relatives. José Antonio Rodríguez Vega was sentenced to 440 years in prison. Death On 24 October 2002, Rodríguez Vega was walking in the prison common grounds when two inmates attacked and brutally stabbed him, inflicting fatal wounds. Rodríguez Vega was buried the next day in a poor coffin. The burial was attended by only two gravediggers.

Together with a number of domestic and foreign artists and musicians, Sakamoto formed the unit NML (No More Landmines). NML produced the EP recording Zero Landmine, which runs for about twenty minutes with ethnic music and singing forming the bulk of the second half of the song. David Sylvian wrote English lyrics for the song. Proceeds from the CD of the recording have gone towards de-mining efforts and other related funds.

Ypsilantis wears the uniform of the Sacred Band. The Sacred Band (Greek: ) was a military force founded by Alexander Ypsilantis at the beginning of the Greek War of Independence, in the middle of March 1821 in Wallachia, now part of Romania. It was formed by volunteers students of the Greek communities of Moldavia, Wallachia and Odessa. It was the first organized military unit of the Greek War of Independence (1821) and of the Greek army in general. Ypsilantis thought that these young people could become the soul of his army. That was the reason that he borrowed the name of the Sacred Band of Thebes. Structure – Organization In Focșani, after the completion of the training of the Sacred Band's members, oath taking ceremony was organized, according to the Tsarist etiquette. After the ceremony, Alexander Ypsilantis gave an enthusiastic speech and gave the flag of the Sacred Band to the commander of the Band, Georgios Kantakouzinos (Athanasios Tsakalov, one of the founders of the Filiki Eteria was the second in command ). Thereafter the Sacred Band's members conducted a military parade singing the military song \\"Asma Polemistirion\\" (Άσμα Πολεμιστήριον) that was written by Adamantios Korais 20 years ago for the Greek Legion that fought in the French invasion of Egypt under Napoleon Bonaparte's command. At the beginning there were 120 members of the Sacred Band and then it reached the number of the 400 members, while the organization of the force was completed in Târgoviște. Uniform Alexsndros Ypsilantis in Sacred Band's attire The men of the Sacred Band wore uniforms inspired by the Black BrunswickersFotinos, Elias (1846). Οι άθλοι της εν Βλαχία Ελληνικής Επαναστάσεως το 1821 έτος.. Εν Λειψία Σακσονίας.. made of black wool felt. For that reason they were also called \\"melanophoroi\\" or \\"mavrophoroi\\" (\\"Black-wearers\\").Rados (1919), p. 4. The Sacred Band uniform consisted of a long tunic, spatter dash and tall headgear, that according to Konstantinos Rados' description the headgear was similar to that of the Hussars. The headgear had a white plume and a tricolor (red, white, cyan) national coat of arms. Under this (frontally) there was a skull with 2 crossed bones of white metal, which was meaning Freedom or Death. A Sacred Band's member had a spearman rifle and a leather belt for the \\"palaska\\" (cartridge belt). The only known part of the Sacred Band's member's uniform is the one of Konstantinos Xenokratis (1803–1876),Zigouri, Nikoletta (2011). \\"Ο επενδυτής του ιερολοχίτη Κωνσταντίνου Ξενοκράτους\\". Τεκμήρια Ιστορίας Μονογραφίες 2011, p. 53-70. which is displayed in the National Historical Museum of Greece.National Historical Museum of Greece – Cloak of Sacred Battalion fighter.Rados(1919), p. 3. Flag The flag of the Sacred Band was tricolor. On the one side there was the inscription \\"ΕΝ ΤΟΥΤΩ ΝΙΚΑ\\" (In this sign, conquer), motto of the Roman emperor and founder of the Byzantine Empire Constantine the Great, who is also portrayed in the flag with his mother Helena of Constantinople in the fashion of Greek Orthodox iconography. On the other side there was the picture of a phoenix regenerated from the flames and the inscription \\"ΕΚ ΤΗΣ ΚΟΝΕΩΣ ΜΟΥ ΑΝΑΓΕΝΝΩΜΑΙ\\" (From my ashes I am reborn). In the paragraphs 11 and 12 of the military organization that was drafted by Nikolaos Ypsilantis, there was the follow instruction about the flag: “The Greek flag both in land and naval army must be composed by three colors: white, red and black. The white color means the innocence of this operation against the tyrants; the black color means our death for the country and freedom and the red color means the independence of Greek people and their pleasure to fight for the country’s resurrection”.Filimon, Timoleon (1861). Δοκίμιον ιστορικόν περί της Ελληνικής Επαναστάσεως. Athens: Τύποις Π. Σούτσα & Α.Κτενά. p. 96. Organization Commander of the Sacred Band was Georgios Kantakouzinos, former senior officer of the tsarist army – who was soon discarded by Ypsilantis. Adjutant of the Sacred Band was Athanasios Tsakalov, cofounder of Filiki Eteria. Centurion of the Sacred Band was Spyridon Drakoulis, an actor from Ithaca, Dimitrios Soutsos from Istanbul, brother of the poet Alexandros Soutsos, Loukas Valsamakis from Kefalonia, Andronikos from Peloponnese, the Phanariot Alexandros Rizos, son of the prime minister of Moldavia Iakovos Rizos Neroulos, Rizos from Ioannina and Chiotis Ioannis Krokias. Except from the Infantry section there was also the Cavalry with Hussar's and Cossack's uniforms. For the organization of the cavalry, a large amount of money was given by the prince of Moldavia, Michael Soutsos. Oath of Sacred Band In Focșani, the students that had no previous military experience, started arm and spear training. Their oath taking took place in the temple of the city; “As a Christian orthodox and son of the Catholic church, I swear in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ and the Holy Trinity to be loyal to my Country and my Religion. I swear to be united with all my brothers for the freedom of our Country. I swear to bleed until death for my Religion and my Country. To kill my own brother if he is a traitor of our Country. To submit to our Country's leader. To not retreat if I don't repel the enemy of my Country and Religion. To fight when my Leader campaigns against the tyrants and to invite my friends to follow me. To hate and despise my enemies. To not give up until I see my Country free and my enemies dead. To spill my blood so that I can beat the enemies of my Religion or to die as a martyr for Jesus Christ. I swear in the name of Holy Communion that I will deprive her if I don't execute all of the promises that I gave in front of our Lord Jesus Christ\\". Battles fought The Sacred Band in the Battle of Drăgășani The unit participated in various battles fought against the Ottoman forces in the Wallachia, notably: * Galați * Slatina * Sculeni * Secu Its largest engagement was the Battle of Drăgășani on 19 June 1821, where there was installed a powerful cavalry garrison of the Ottomans. After three days of march under bad weather conditions, the Sacred Band arrived across Dragatsani, where it encamped. The next day (7 June 1821), before the complete arrival of the army, the skirmishes began. The result was the failed attack of the Greek cavalry under the command of Vasileios Karavias. The Sacred Band, headed by Nikolaos Ypsilantis, asked for help with 375 officers and soldiers but the flight of Karavias division forced the Sacred Band members to fight alone without the help of the cavalry. The Ottoman cavalry, headed by Kara Feiz, attacked before the Sacred Band's formation in squares. The Band was split into two parts and the battle was fierce. There have been many losses; the centurion, the Band's flag bearer, 25 officers and 180 soldiers died, while 37 Sacred Band's members were captured and were sent to Bucharest and then to Istanbul where they were beheaded. In a crucial phase of the battle, Giorgakis Olympios arrived and saved 136 members, including Nikolaos Ypsilantis and Athanasios Tsakalov, and the flag of the Sacred Band. Nikolaos Ypsilantis was saved by a French philhellene officer. Alexander Ypsilantis went to Rimniko, where he wrote his last command on 8 June 1821, by which he stigmatized the betrayal of the political and military staff and praised the sacrifice of the Sacred Band; \\"You shadows of pure Hellenes and the Sacred Band, those who were betrayed, you were victims for the felicity of the country, accept the gratitude of your homogenous. A stele with your names written on her will be raised soon. The names of those who showed me faith and honesty are written with fiery letters in my heart. Their memory will always be the only drink of my soul\\".Rados(1919), p. 14 – 16. Monuments devoted to the Sacred Band Monument in Pedion tou Areos by Stamatios Kleanthis Despite its failure, the Sacred Band inspired the uprising in mainland Greece, which started in March 1821. In Dragatsani's cemetery in Romania there is the Monument of the Deceased Sacred Band's members which was erected in 1884, an initiative by the editing committee of the Greek newspaper \\"Syllogoi\\" in Bucharest. The memorial was crafted in Pentelic marble by Chalepas and Lampaditis. It is 7 meters in height. On the front side of the pillar rises a 5-meter monolith with embossed cross on the crescent and under this the symbol of the Sacred Band's members. At the center of the pillar there is the inscription: “ΔΙΑΒΑΤΑ ΑΓΓΕΛΟΥ ΟΤΙ ΕΝΘΑΔΕ ΚΕΙΜΕΘΑ ΥΠΕΡ ΕΛΕΥΘΕΡΙΑΣ ΑΓΩΝΙΣΑΜΕΝΟΙ.” The poet Alexandros Soutsos set another stele for the Sacred Band’s members, crafted by Leonidas Drosis, in the memory of his brother Dimitrios, the fallen centurion of the Sacred Band in 1845 northwest of the University. Since 1885 the stele was transferred near to the Holy Temple of Taxiarches in Pedion tou Areos, near to the Alexander Ypsilantis monument, which was crafted in 1869 by Drosis.

Aref al-Dajani was born in Jerusalem in 1856. Political activism In 1918, after serving for one year as mayor of Jerusalem, al-Dajani joined the Administrative Committee of the Muslim-Christian Association (MCA) and went on to become Jerusalem and then regional president of the organization. The Jerusalem Congress convened January 27 – February 10, 1919, under the leadership of Aref al-Dajani and Izzat Darwazah. The resolution reached at this forum was cabled to the Paris Peace Conference on behalf of the Arabs of Palestine, demanding a renunciation of the Balfour Declaration and the inclusion of Palestine as \\"an integral part of...the independent Arab Government of Syria within an Arab Union, free of any foreign influence or protection.\\" As chairman of the Jerusalem Congress, al-Dajani rejected political Zionism and agreed to accept British assistance on condition that it did not impinge on Arab sovereignty in Palestine. He envisaged Palestine as part of an independent Syrian state governed by Faisal of the Hashemite family.Palestine Factionalism in the National Movement (1919-1939) In a speech to the King-Crane Commission in 1919, as a leader of the delegation of the Muslim-Christian association he stated, “It is impossible for us to make an understanding with them [Jews] or even to live them together… Their history and all their past proves that it is impossible to live with them. In all the countries where they are at present they are not wanted and undesirables, because they always arrive to suck the blood of everybody, and to become economically and financially victorious. If the League of Nations will not listen to the appeal of the Arabs this country will become a river of blood.” In September 1920, al-Dajani became deputy president of a committee of notables established by the Pan-Islamic Movement. In his opening speech, he read letters received from Turkey and India, and called for Pan-Islamic ideals to be embraced by Palestinian Muslims.British Pan-Arab Policy, 1915-1922: A Critical Appraisal, Isaiah Friedman During 1921 al-Dajani was the Muslim assessor for the Haycraft Commission of Inquiry cross examining witnesses.Luke, Sir Harry (1953) Cities and Men.

The film is about a group of Confederate soldiers, unaware that the Civil War is over, who intercept a shipment of gold escorted by Union cavalry troops and are then pursued by a renegade posse. Hangman's Knot was filmed on location in the Alabama Hills in Lone Pine, California. Plot In the spring of 1865 in Nevada, a small band of Confederate soldiers disguised as civilians intercept a shipment of gold escorted by Union cavalry troops. Following a heated battle, Confederate Major Matt Stewart (Randolph Scott) learns from a dying Union officer that the war ended a month earlier. Matt and his men transport the gold as planned to the scheduled rendezvous with Captain Petersen (Glenn Langan) who has been scouting the area disguised as a travelling peddler. When Petersen confirms that he knew the war was over, but made no attempt to tell the men, hot-headed Rolph Bainter (Lee Marvin) shoots him dead. The men briefly debate what to do with the gold. As ranking officer, Matt decides they will take the gold back to the South to help finance their country's reconstruction. The following day, Matt disguises himself and uses Petersen's covered wagon to transport the gold and his men, out of the area. Soon they are stopped by a group of drifters posing as a posse looking for the gold thieves, but before they discover the Confederate rebels, Matt persuades the posse's leader Quincey (Ray Teal) that they've been caught elsewhere, and the posse rides off. Matt and his men continue on, but the mules bolt from the wagon and the rebels are forced to commandeer a stagecoach carrying a former Union war nurse Molly Hull (Donna Reed) and her companion Lee Kemper (Richard Denning). Quincey's posse returns and chases the stage to a station house, capturing one of Matt's men, Cass Browne (Frank Faylen), in the process. They drag him through the brush in an effort to discover the location of the gold. Meanwhile, Matt and his men take the stage passengers, the ageing station agent Plunkett (Clem Bevans), and his daughter Margaret Harris (Jeanette Nolan) hostage. Inside the station house, when Kemper accuses Matt and his men of having murdered all of the Union volunteers guarding the gold shipment, Matt explains that they were carrying out a military mission, acting under orders, and that men died on both sides. Margaret is unmoved by the explanation, embittered over the loss of her husband and son in the war. Molly and Kemper remain suspicious, but Molly tends to one of the wounded rebels. Matt then addresses Quincey's posse who have surrounded the station house by now, trying to convince them that the gold is hidden near the abandoned wagon. As night descends, Matt asks each of the hostages to give him their word that they will remain silent while he and the men slip out in the dark. As they leave, Kemper yells out a warning to the posse, and Matt and his men are forced back into the station house. Matt prevents the violent Rolph from killing Kemper. Later that night, the posse try to lure the Confederates out by threatening to hang Cass, but Matt is able to rescue him using the remaining sticks of dynamite from their ambush. The following day, Kemper offers Matt a way of escape in exchange for two gold bars. Giving Matt an Indian token, Kemper explains that his good trading relationship with the local Paiute Indians and this token will guarantee fresh horses and safe passage out of the territory. He also knows by the approaching clouds that a brief torrential rainstorm will soon arrive and supply Matt and his men cover for their escape. Matt agrees to the plan. Later, while Molly is caring for the wounded man in another room, Rolph tries to rape her. An enraged Matt stops him and beats him in a fistfight. When an angry Rolph tries to shoot Matt, young Jamie Groves (Claude Jarman, Jr.) shoots the gun out of Rolph's hand, and is then forced to shoot him dead. Meanwhile, during the night, Quincey and his men have been digging a short tunnel under the station house. Just when they break through and reach a trap door in the floor, Cass stops them from entering. Frustrated, Quincey decides to burn the station house down and orders his men to torch the roof. As the fire burns through the roof, Kemper's predicted thunderstorm arrives. In the confusion, Kemper tries to escape with his two gold bars and is shot dead by the posse. When Cass sneaks outside to scatter the posse's horses, he is also killed. As Matt and Jamie prepare to escape, Molly begs Matt not to take the gold. Outside in the chaos of the storm, Quincey and his men begin shooting at one another. Believing Matt told the truth about the whereabouts of the gold, the surviving members of the posse race each other into the night. With the posse gone, and respecting Molly's wishes, Matt and Jamie surrender the gold to Plunkett. Margaret and Plunkett offer a home to young Jamie, who promises he will return. Matt also promises Molly that he will return to her after he is repatriated in Virginia, and the two embrace.

It is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade II* listed building. History There are records of a chaplain at or possibly from Chadkirk in 1347; however, the fact that the name incorporates the word \\"kirk\\", deriving from the Scandinavian word for a church or chapel, points to even earlier worship here, at a time when Scandinavian influence on the local dialects of English was strong enough for \\"kirk\\" to be a usual word for a house of worship. The earliest part of the present structure is the half-timbered east end dating back, very probably, to the 16th century, the time of the Tudor kings and queens and of the Reformation, the break between the English Church and the Church of Rome. In time, however, the chapel fell into disuse and decay. It passed through a succession of owners and is even reputed to have been used as a stable. Subsequently, it was used by Nonconformists but they were ejected during the reign of Queen Anne and erected a new chapel at Hatherlow, at the top of the hill overlooking Chadkirk; this church also became neglected and was \\"in a ruinous condition\\" until in 1747 it was taken over once again by the Church of England and substantially rebuilt in stone. Further repairs were carried out at Chadkirk in 1761 and 1860. In 1876 there was a restoration when much of the furniture was removed. The chapel was declared redundant in 1971 and was acquired by Bredbury and Romiley Urban District Council. In 1974 local government reorganisation abolished \\"urban districts\\" and the area was transferred to the newly created Stockport Metropolitan Borough Council. The chapel was restored in 1995 and is now open as a visitor attraction. Architecture The west end of the chapel with the timber bell-cote The present building dates from the 16th century, although the south walls were rebuilt in 1747. It is a timber-framed building with a slate roof but most of the walls have been rebuilt in dressed stone. At the west end is a timber bell-cote with a pyramidal roof and a weather-vane. The south wall of the nave has two doors and two windows with semicircular heads. Above the west door is a gabled dormer window. The chancel has a semicircular- headed window. The east and north walls of the chancel retain their timber framing. At the east end is a window with a semicircular head.

Function  This gene encodes a cytoplasmic protein that forms one of the central hubs in the apoptosis regulatory network. This protein contains (from the N terminal) a caspase recruitment domain (CARD), an ATPase domain (NB-ARC), few short helical domains and then several copies of the WD40 repeat domain. Upon binding cytochrome c and dATP, this protein forms an oligomeric apoptosome. The apoptosome binds and cleaves Procaspase-9 protein, releasing its mature, activated form. The precise mechanism for this reaction is still debated though work published by Guy Salvesen suggests that the apoptosome may induce caspase-9 dimerization and subsequent autocatalysis. Activated caspase-9 stimulates the subsequent caspase cascade that commits the cell to apoptosis. Alternative splicing results in several transcript variants encoding different isoforms.

Raymond Scott designed and constructed some of the first electro-mechanical music sequencers in the 1940s. Incidentally in 1951, computer music was started from the music sequencing, and later its applicable fields were expanded into the music composition and sound generation. However, the RCA Mark II Sound Synthesizer in 1957 was still indirectly controlled via punch-tape system similar to piano rolls, a kind of mechanical sequencer. Also, in earlier electronic music, artists used sound-on-film technology to generate sound waves as well as control sequences of notes. At its most basic, an analog sequencer consists of a bank of potentiometers and a \\"clock\\" (pulse generator) connected to a sequencer, which steps through these potentiometers one at a time and then cycles back to the beginning. The output of the sequencer is fed (as a control voltage and gate pulse) to a synthesizer. By \\"tuning\\" the potentiometers, a short repetitive rhythmic motif or riff can be set up. The most commonly used analog sequencer was the Moog 960, which was a module of the Moog modular synthesizer. It consisted of three parallel banks of eight potentiometers: the three banks could either steer three different Voltage-controlled oscillators (VCOs) to allow three-note chords in the sequence, or (for example) one row could steer pitch while the second row is patched through to the filter cutoff or VCA volume, and a third steers filter cutoff for a white noise generator (thus creating an extremely primitive electronic drum track). Under each of the eight steps, a switch offered three options: play this step, skip this step, or loop back to the beginning. To avoid the monotony of endlessly repeated sequences, pioneering electronic musicians like Chris Franke of Tangerine Dream and Michael Hoenig would manipulate these switches in real time during performance, adding and dropping notes and beats from a sequence. Also, the \\"pitch\\" row can be patched to two or more oscillators tuned to intervals, and the oscillators mixed in and out one at a time. Good examples of all these techniques can be heard on the Phaedra, Rubycon, Ricochet, and Encore albums of Tangerine Dream, as well as on Departure from the Northern Wasteland by Michael Hoenig. By synchronizing two sequencers, and manipulating them individually, swirling polyrhythmic phasing patterns (as introduced in minimalist music by Steve Reich) can be set up. The title track of the Michael Hoenig album (mentioned above) is an excellent example. An additional module (Moog 962) allowed \\"daisy-chaining\\" the three rows to form one longer 24-step sequence. In addition, a switch on the 960 itself let the third (bottom) row be used for note lengths. The output voltage of the sequencer can be added to the output voltage of a keyboard controller, and the latter used to transpose the sequence on the fly. Klaus Schulze was particularly fond of this technique, which lays the musical foundation for tracks like \\"Bayreuth Return\\" from Timewind, \\"Floating\\" from Moondawn, and any rhythmic piece from Klaus Schulze's \\"analog\\" years. Vangelis and Jean-Michel Jarre likewise availed themselves of this technique. Apart from a temperature-controlled environment after warmup, pitch stability could be problematic. On the famous opening of Phaedra, the sequencer had drifted out of tune, and one can clearly hear Chris Franke retuning the sequence by ear in real time. In addition to the 1027 module, which is a conventional 3x10 step sequencer, the ARP 2500 was often equipped with the 1050 Mix-Sequencer module. Unlike contemporary sequencers that only generated voltages, the 1050 could also sequence audio signals. This allowed each step of the sequence to come from a completely different sound source. The 8 positions could run in sequence or be split into two independent four-step sequencers. It's easily identified by its vertical column of 8 square white buttons that light up to indicate the active step(s). Analog sequencers, have in some respects, been replaced by digital devices and software implementations. However, there is a continued interest by modular analog synthesists, who appreciate the real time control offered by the analog sequencer as evidenced by the 'Oberkorn' machine by Analog Solutions, amongst others. ;Various analog sequencers File:Buchla 100 series at NYU.jpg |One of the 1st commercially available analog sequencer (bottom, 3×8-step and 3×16-step) on Buchla 100 (1964/1966) File:1st commercial Moog synthesizer (1964, commissioned by the Alwin Nikolai Dance Theater of NY) @ Stearns Collection (Stearns 2035), University of Michigan.jpg |Earlier Moog sequencer (left, added after 1968) on the 1st commercially sold Moog Modular prototype (c.1964) File:Arp 2500 the synth found in the movie Close Encounters of the Third Kind circa 1976.jpg |ARP 1027 Clocked Sequential Control Module (3rd&4th from right) and 1050 Mix-Sequencer module to its right on ARP 2500 (1970) File:EML ElectroComp modular synth & sequencer.jpg |EML Sequencer 400 (top ×2, 6×16 step) on EML ElectroComp modular synthesizer (1970) .

Function  This gene encodes a member of the carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) gene family, which belongs to the immunoglobulin superfamily. Two subgroups of the CEA family, the CEA cell adhesion molecules and the pregnancy-specific glycoproteins, are located within a 1.2 Mb cluster on the long arm of chromosome 19. Eleven pseudogenes of the CEA cell adhesion molecule subgroup are also found in the cluster. The encoded protein was originally described in bile ducts of liver as biliary glycoprotein. Subsequently, it was found to be a cell–cell adhesion molecule detected on leukocytes, epithelia, and endothelia. The encoded protein mediates cell adhesion via homophilic as well as heterophilic binding to other proteins of the subgroup. Multiple cellular activities have been attributed to the encoded protein, including roles in the differentiation and arrangement of tissue three-dimensional structure, angiogenesis, apoptosis, tumor suppression, metastasis, and the modulation of innate and adaptive immune responses. Multiple transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been reported, but the full-length nature of only two has been determined. In melanocytic cells CEACAM1 gene expression may be regulated by MITF.  Interactions  CEACAM1 has been shown to interact with PTPN11 and Annexin A2.

It is also known as 26 kDa cell surface protein, TAPA-1 (Target of the Antiproliferative Antibody 1), and Tetraspanin-28 (Tspan-28).  Gene  The gene is located on the plus strand of the short arm of chromosome 11 (11p15.5). It is 20,103 bases in length and encodes a protein of 236 amino acids (predicted molecular weight 25.809 kDa). The protein does not appear to be post translationally modified and has four transmembrane domains. Both the N-terminus and C-terminus lie on the intracellular side of the membrane. The gene is expressed in hemopoietic, endothelial, and epithelial cells. It is absent from erythrocytes, platelets, and neutrophils.  Function  The protein encoded by this gene is a member of the transmembrane 4 superfamily, also known as the tetraspanin family. Most of these members are cell-surface proteins that are characterized by the presence of four hydrophobic domains. The proteins mediate signal transduction events that play a role in the regulation of cell development, activation, growth and motility. This encoded protein is a cell surface glycoprotein that is known to complex with integrins. This protein appears to promote muscle cell fusion and support myotube maintenance. Also it may be involved in signal transduction. This gene is localized in the tumor-suppressor gene region and thus it is a candidate gene for malignancies. The tetraspanin family includes CD9, CD37, CD53, CD63, CD81 (this protein), CD82 and CD151. CD81 interacts directly with immunoglobulin superfamily member 8 (IGSF8, CD316) and CD36. It forms a signal transduction complex with CD19, CD21 and Leu-13 (CD225) on the surface of the B cell. On T cells CD81 associates with CD4 and CD8 and provides a costimulatory signal with CD3.  Clinical significance  This protein plays a critical role in Hepatitis C attachment and/or cell entry by interacting with virus' E1/E2 glycoproteins heterodimer. The large extracellular loop of CD81 binds the hepatitis E2 glycoprotein dimer. HCV-E2 and CD81 binding Kd is 1.8 nM. HCV-E2 engaged CD81 is only 30% internalized after 12hr, suggesting CD81 may be primarily an attachment receptor for HCV. It also appears to play a role in liver invasion by Plasmodium species. CD81 is required for Plasmodium vivax sporozoite entry into human hepatocytes and for Plasmodium yoelii sporozoite entry into murine hepatocytes. HIV gag proteins use tetraspanin enriched microdomains (containing minimally CD81, CD82, CD63) as a platform for virion assembly and release. Purified HIV produced by MOLT\\\\HIV cells contains CD81. Anti-CD81 antibodies downregulate HIV production 3 fold, however the CD81 protein free virus is more infectious. Engagement of CD81 lowers the signaling threshold required to trigger T-Cell\\\\CD3 mediated proviral DNA in CD4+ T cells. CD81 appears to play a role in the pathogenesis of influenza.  Interactions  CD81 has been shown to interact with TSPAN4, CD19, CD9, PTGFRN, CD117 and CD29. =Ligands= Benzyl salicylate and terfenadine have been shown to bind to CD81.
