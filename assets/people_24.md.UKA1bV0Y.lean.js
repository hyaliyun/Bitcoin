He formerly served in the United States Air Force.  Life and career  Hadley was born in 1936 and grew up near Thomasville at Pebble Hill, a former cotton plantation in Thomas County, Georgia. At the time of Hadley's birth, Pebble Hill was mainly used for hunting. He was the tenth of 15 children, and is the grandson of a slave who worked at Pebble Hill. After graduating from high school, he joined the United States Air Force, where he worked with supplies and logistics. He has been married for more than sixty years and has three children. His tenure included postings in Europe, the Middle East and Vietnam. After 28 years he retired with the rank of chief master sergeant. The family moved back to Thomasville and Hadley started working for the United States Postal Service, until his retirement in 1997. Hadley is a Prince Hall Freemason. In 2018, Thomas University awarded him an honorary bachelor's degree in business administration, in recognition of his work in the Air Force and the community.  Jack Hadley Black History Museum  Hadley began collecting newspaper clippings on the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr. in 1968, and in the late 1970s he helped his son with a schoolproject about black history. This grew his interest in black history, and he was later invited to participate in Black History Month events in Thomasville. He started collecting memorabilia, which in time became the collection of his museum. Hadley founded the museum in 1995; in 2006 it opened at its current location, a former school in Thomasville. The museum has received grants to \\"provide educational programming for school students in the Thomas County and Thomasville City School systems\\", and in 2019 it started an education pilot program in cooperation with Thomas County Middle School. As of 2019, the museum has more than 4,000 items. The museum has had more than 18,000 visitors since 2006, and reported nearly 4,000 visitors in 2018. In 2017, Hadley, his family and the museum were honored in a resolution from the Georgia House of Representatives. Wayne Clough, former Secretary of the Smithsonian, praised the museum after visiting. Hadley also created the \\"Thomasville Black Heritage Trail Tour\\", a \\"step-on, step-off\\" tour which focuses on Henry Ossian Flipper (1856–1940), an American soldier and former slave. The museum successfully advocated the creation of a commemorative postage stamp for Flipper, as well as naming a Thomasville post office after him.  Imperial Hotel  alt=The Negro Travelers' Green Book Following the attention garnered by the 2018 film Green Book, Hadley involved himself in an attempt to restore the Imperial Hotel, a Thomasville building included in The Negro Travelers' Green Book, a travel guide for African-Americans listing places that would not refuse them service. Hadley commented that had he known about the book in the 1960s, it would have been helpful to him, since he often had to drive long distances and at times was turned away because he was black. There are plans to make part of the Imperial Hotel a \\"satellite site\\" of the Jack Hadley Black History Museum, and as of October 2019, over $190,000 had been raised for the restoration. A group of historians led by Hadley has purchased the building, the city's only black-owned hotel. In October 2019, the efforts received recognition from Thomasville Landmarks, a local historical society.

Raised in 1948 as a Citizen Military Forces anti-tank unit designated the 3rd Anti-Tank Regiment, it was converted to a field artillery regiment in the 1950s. It supported the 5th Brigade until being reduced to a battery-sized sub unit, and assigned to the 9th Regiment, Royal Australian Artillery in 2018. History In 1948, the part-time Citizens Military Force was re-raised following the demobilisation of the wartime military forces. At this time, the 3rd Anti-Tank Regiment raised in New South Wales as part of the 2nd Division. Under the command of Lieutenant Colonel John Argent, the regiment perpetuated the 2/3rd Anti-Tank Regiment, which had been raised during World War II. On raising, the regiment had depots at Belmore, Homebush and Ashfield. In 1951, the regiment was converted to a new role as a field artillery regiment, and was re-designated as the 3rd Light Regiment. By 1953, the regiment was under the command of Lieutenant Colonel T.A. Harris. The regiment assumed the designation of the 23rd Light Regiment in 1956, and then the 23rd Field Regiment in 1957; at this time it was equipped with Ordnance QF 25-pounder field guns. This numerical designation replicated the designation of the 23rd Australian Field Artillery (Howitzer) Brigade that had served as part of the 3rd Division on the Western Front from 1916 until early 1917 when it was disbanded as part of a reorganisation to consolidate the number of guns within each battery and reduce the number of artillery brigades in each division. Plans had been made to raise this unit again as the 23rd Field Regiment during World War II from Y Troop, 18th Field Battery, which had been raised as reinforcements for the Darwin Mobile Force, but these plans were cancelled in June 1942. The regiment began operating 105 mm field guns in 1965, and adopted the L119 Hamel 105 mm field gun, in support of the 5th Brigade, which was assigned to the 2nd Division. By 1976, the regiment was combined to form the 18th/23rd Field Regiment, under the command of Lieutenant Colonel S.P. Wheeler; it later returned to the designation of the 23rd Field Regiment. In 2011, the regiment fired a 21-gun salute near Sydney Harbour to commemorate Australia Day along with the 7th Field Regiment, Royal Australian Artillery. Later that year, it was re-designated as the 23rd Regiment, Royal Australian Artillery. In 2012, the regiment converted to the L16 81mm mortar as the Army Reserve artillery units were converted to the light support role. Throughout the 2000s, the regiment had depots in Kogarah, Sutherland, Holsworthy and Canberra, and deployed personnel in support of operations in the Solomon Islands, East Timor, Iraq and Afghanistan. The regiment was subsequently reduced to a battery and in 2018 became part of the 9th Regiment, Royal Australian Artillery.

A. Vallabha under banner of Creative Commercials.. The film was panned by the critics and audience though Deverakonda and Aishwarya’s performances were praised.  Plot  The film begins with Gautham in a prison saying that he too has a story to tell. The film cuts to Yamini and Gautham's story. They are in a live-in relationship. Gautham is pursuing his dream of becoming a writer. Yamini takes care of Gautham like a mother and is always supportive of his decisions. But she doesn't see him putting in any effort for his dream and is fed up with her routine life. She eventually breaks up with Gautham. This makes Gauthum start writing again and he writes a story which takes place in Yellandu. The protagonist Srinu is a union leader in the coal mines and is married to Suvarna unwillingly and the couple have a 5-year old son. The newly appointed officer, Ms.Smitha gets close to Srinu, not knowing that he is married. Srinu does not disclose his marital status either, and starts to avoid his own wife Suvarna. Suvarna suspects that her husband is having an extra-marital affair but doesn't confront him. Instead, she decides to pursue her career. She tops her examinations and it is published in the local newspaper, causing Smitha to know that Srinu is married, that too with a son. Srinu upon rushing home, finds Suvarna in a modern dress. She tells him that she'll be whatever he wants her to be, including wearing revealing clothes and make-up. All this made Srinu understand his mistake and go back to loving his wife. The story ends with a note from Gautham saying that Srinu sacrificed everything to be with his wife. Now, the story cuts back to the present where Gautham recalls his past on how he first encountered Yamini and how they fell in love. The next morning, he goes to meet Yamini in her office to tell her that he has started writing again, but Yamini asks him to leave. Another glimpse from his past is shown, when Gautham and Yamini used to work in the same office. Yamini was going to get terminated and Gautham was going to get a promotion to work in Paris. Instead he resigns the job requesting the manager to retain Yamini's position. The film again cuts back to the present where Gautham says that if he hadn't resigned his job, he would have been in Paris right now. This inspires him to write another story which takes place in Paris. In Paris, Gautham is working in a radio station, he loves Parachuting. He falls in love with his neighbour Iza, a pilot. On Iza's birthday she wanted something memorable, so Gautham takes her for bike racing which ends in a tragic accident where Iza loses her eyesight. After 6 months, she gets a compatible eye donor and regains her vision. It is revealed that Gautham was the one who donated his eyes for Iza and he tells her to come back to him if she realised his love. This story ends with a note saying that Gautham sacrificed his vision for love. The film cuts to the present when Yamini comes to visit Gautham to invite him for her wedding, which is in 3 days. A frustrated Gautham yells at Yamini and she leaves the house. Gautham later goes to Yamini's house to try and convince her in vain. On his way home he gets into a fight with a random guy and ends up in prison for bashing his head with a rock. After 2 years Gautham is released and his friend publishes his book on behalf of Gautham, named \\"The World Famous Lover\\". Gautham attends the press meet of his book's success event while the public eagerly waits for the unfinished climax of the story. On stage, he recounts his tale stating that upon returning from jail Yamini waits for him and they both live happily ever after, whereas in reality no one was waiting for him. He says that its always been Yamini who compromised. And even in Srinu's story it is Suvarna who always compromised and not her husband. In the Paris love story, the sacrifice made by Gautham came from the sacrifice made by Yamini in real life. He concludes the press meet by saying that he wants Yamini to be happy wherever she is. Later, Yamini's father reveals to Gautham that when Yamini came to know that he had been arrested, she called off her wedding. He then leaves his daughter to Gautham. Gautham asks for forgiveness. She forgives him and asks if he knows the route to his home. He nods, implying yes. The film ends with Gautham and Yamini getting back together.

Writing for Times of India, Suhas Yellapantula gave 2 out of 5 stars and wrote that \\"World Famous Lover comes across as a caustic rant of a disgruntled writer who subjects the audience to two hours and 36 minutes of his tears and frustration. Vijay Deverakonda yells, cries, punches mirrors, bangs his head against rocks, speaks Telangana dialect and jumps off planes, but he still remains a helpless spectator as Kranthi Madhav tires the audience with his gloomy love story. Aishwarya Rajesh stands out among the women with a powerful performance.\\" Janani K of India Today rated 2 out of 5 and wrote that \\"Director Kranthi Madhav’s World Famous Lover aims to be an emotional love story that speaks about compromise and sacrifice. Sadly, the film doesn’t have much substance to keep it going for two and a half hours.\\" The New Indian Express wrote that \\"The director has been unable to make an impression with his script which is filled with heavy melodrama and contrived emotions\\". Baradwaj Rangan of Film Companion South wrote \\"More annoyingly, writing this story doesn’t seem to have given Gautham any kind of catharsis. When we return to the present day, to the real-life Gautham, he is still Arjun Reddy the angsty wallower he was when Yamini left him.\\"  References   External Links  * Category:2020 romantic drama films Category:Indian films Category:Telugu-language films Category:Indian romantic drama films Category:Films shot in France Category:Films shot in Telangana Category:2020s Telugu-language films ","title":"World Famous Lover"},{"id":"61810762","text":"Mihir Vardhan is the 33rd Administrator of the Indian Union Territory of Lakshadweep.

In Engishiki, a formal record on shrines written 1000 years ago, this area was developed by the textile industry. The villagers believe the weaving goddess known as Tanabata-tsume (棚機津女) from ancient times, and the story of the Cowherd and the Weaver Girl from China was assimilated, it is now known as the god of textiles. Festivals Tanabata Grand festival, the annual summer festival held August 6-8 every year. On the evening of August 6 children bring the mikoshi from the shrine, carry it around the neighborhoods that worship at the shrine. At 5 o'clock on the following day morning, the lion dance is performed as a prayer dedicated to the shrine. And later in the morning, the lion dancer and children pulling a float visit neighbors. In the evening, many open-air stalls line the path leading to the shrine, and wishes written on strips of paper sent from people throughout Japan decorate every available space.

The Ikettes were backing vocalists for the Ike & Tina Turner Revue. (G)Old & New is their second and final studio album, containing new songs and different version of previously released tracks such as their hit \\"I'm Blue (The Gong-Gong Song)\\" which featured Tina Turner singing background vocals.  Recording and release  (G)Old & New was recorded at Ike & Tina Turner's studio, Bolic Sound, in June 1973. The album was made due to popular demand, via requests to United Artists for an Ikettes album. The album features new compositions and new versions of old songs. The first hit single by the Ikettes \\"I'm Blue (The Gong-Gong Song),\\" was released in 1961. It reached No. 19 on the Billboard Hot 100 and No. 3 on the R&B; chart. They released two more charting singles in 1965, \\"Peaches 'N' Cream\\" (Pop No. 36, R&B; No. 28) and \\"I'm So Thankful\\" (Pop No. 74, R&B; No. 12). For the album, the Ikettes recorded two songs by the Supremes, soul/funk infused renditions of \\"Someday We'll Be Together\\" and \\"Come See About Me.\\" There are also high energy funk rock covers of Billy Preston's \\"Will It Go Round In Circles\\" and the Doobie Brothers' \\"Listen to the Music.\\" As well as songs by Joe Tex and The Crystals.

In 1943, she became the secretary of her husband-to- be Flemming Muus who acted as chief agent in Denmark for the British Special Operations Executive. When Muus was forced to move to Sweden, Wichfeld was charged with telegraphing messages to London as only she knew the secret codes. Together with Muus, she moved to London in 1944 where they remained until the end of the war. Biography Born on 9 February 1922 in the Engestofte manor house near Maribo on the island of Lolland, Varinka Corinna Wichfeld was the second of the three children of the Danish aristocrat Jørgen Adalbert Wichfeld (1885–1966) and Monica Emily Massy-Beresford (1894–1945). Also known as Inkie, as a small child she was brought up in the manor house. Thanks to periods spent with her family in England, France, Austria and England, she became fluent in several languages. From 1929 to 1941, she lived with her family in Italy, mainly in Rapallo. Both she and her mother initially supported Mussolini as they had come into contact with Francoist refugees but they soon turned against fascism. In April 1940, on hearing of the German occupation of Denmark while in Florence, Wichfeld suddenly developed feelings of Danish patriotism. On returning to Denmark in late 1941, they both joined the resistance movement. Wichfeld was involved in distributing illegal magaines, helping fugitives and hiding exlosives on the estate, while after meeting Flemming Muus her mother planned resistance activities in the Lolland- Falster region. In July 1943, Wichfeld was sent to Copenhagen by her mother to inform Muus of developments. It was then that Muus decided she should become his future wife and engaged her as his secretary. Wichfeld and her husband Flemming Muus c.1945 In January 1944, Wichfeld learnt that the Gestapo had arrested her family at the Engestofte manor house. Realizing that she was also in danger of being arrested, she informed Muus that she intended to leave for neutral Sweden but he refused, explaining that her services were vital. She died her hair, dressed differently, wore spectacles and acquired new identity cards. In May 1944, Wichfeld learnt that her mother had been sentenced to death by the Gestapo and that shortly afterwards she had been pardoned and sent to Germany. She married Muus in June but soon they were both in imminent danger of being arrested. Muus moved to Sweden but left his wife in Denmark to keep telegraphing messages to London as she knew all the secret codes. In December 1944, both Varinka and her husband were called to London where they remained until the end of the war. Varinka Wichfeld Muss joined the British army and became a lieutenant. After the war, they both returned to Denmark where Muus was attached to the British Military Mission while his wife worked as his driver and secretary. They went through a rough period after Muus was sentenced to enprisonment for embezzlement in 1946 but was later pardoned. After spending some time in South Africa, the couple returned to Denmark where they both worked on a biography of Monica Wichfeld. Published by Arco in 1955, the English translation was titled Monica Wichfeld, a Very Gallant Woman. Varinka Wichfeld Muus died on 18 December 2002 in Copenhagen. She is buried in Søllerød Cemetery.

Between 1953 and 1961 he served as director of the Franz Mehring Institute for training teachers in Marxist-Leninist Sociological Studies, which was a core (and for much of the time compulsory) base module for students at the Karl Marx University (as it was known between 1953 and 1991) of Leipzig. Between 1958 and his retirement in 1978 Prof. Mosler taught the History of the German Labour Movement at the university. Life =Provenance and early years= Lothar Gerhard Mosler was born in Ziegenhals (known, after 1944/45, as Głuchołazy), which was a small mining town on the southern frontier region of Upper Silesia. Max Mosler, his father, was a master carpenter and, later, a war pensioner. His mother, Sophie, was at one stage employed as a cook. He attended school in Ziegenhals between 1920 and 1928, moving on to the secondary school in Breslau (subsequently, since 1944/45, identified as Wrocław), successfully completing his schooling by passing his Abitur in 1933. His interest in politics was evidenced by his membership of the \\"Sozialistischer Schülerbund\\" between 1928 and 1930 and his role as a local leader with the Breslau Young Communists between 1930 and 1933. =National Socialism= In January 1933 the Hitler government took power and lost no time in transforming Germany into a one-party dictatorship. Communist involvement was outlawed and Mosler appears to have respected the changes. Between 1934 and 1939 he was a member of the government-backed Deutsche Arbeitsfront (\\"German Labour Front\\") which had been created by the new government to replace the now outlawed trades unions. Between 1934 and 1936 he undertook and completed commercial apprenticeship in salesmanship at the prestigious Wertheim department store in Breslau. He then worked successively as a cloths and materials salesman at the Zeeck department store in Dessau (1936–1937), the Bielschowsky department store in Breslau (1937–1938) and the Langenfeld department store in Braunschweig (1938–1939). In 1939 war broke out and Mosler was conscripted into the army. He was assigned to the supplies unit of the 17th Infantry Division and took part in the invasion of Poland. Promoted to the rank of corporal, he remained with the regiment as an administrative assistant in the army clothes department when the regiment was switched to northern France in 1940 and then sent east in 1941 in the context of the invasion of the Soviet Union. He was awarded the \\"Ostmedaille\\" (\\"Eastern Front Medal\\") in 1942 and 1943 the \\"Kriegsverdienstkreuz\\" (\\"War Merit Cross\\") Class 2. In May 1945 he was captured by advancing Soviet troops at Teplice. However, he was held for barely a month, being released at Dresden (since May 1945 administered as part of the newly created Soviet occupation zone) on 13 June 1945. =Postwar= In the Fall/Autumn of 1945 Mosler secured a place on the fast-track New Teacher Scheme that the military administration had introduced to address the desperate shortage of school teachers that had been created both by the slaughter of war and by the reluctance of the occupation authorities to place confidence in anyone suspected of possible involvement with the National Socialists during the preceding twelve years. He then, in 1945/46 took over the headship of a primary school at Cunewalde which, following frontier changes mandated by the allied leaders, was now on the extreme south-eastern edge of Germany's Soviet occupation zone. Between 1946 and 1949 he served as an SED local councillor for the district of Löbau. During 1946/47 he also headed up the arts and culture department for Löbau district. He joined the Communist Party in 1945 and then, following the contentious party merger of April 1946, was among the thousands who promptly signed their party membership across to the new Socialist Unity Party (\\"Sozialistische Einheitspartei Deutschlands\\") which had been created, it was explained, in order to ensure that political divisions on the political left could never again be exploited as a route to power by populists. Ironically, by the time the Soviert zone was relaunched in October 1949 as the Soviet- sponsored German Democratic Republic (East Germany), the SED had itself emerged as the ruling party in a new kind of German one-party dictatorship. It was an indication that he had been marked out for future advancement than between January and March 1947 he attended the regional SED party academy in nearby Ottendorf. He himself took over the headship at another regional party school, in Kleindehsa, between 1947 and 1949. Then, between October 1948 and April 1949, he was a student at the national Karl Marx Party Academy at Hakeburg Manor in Kleinmachnow, just outside Berlin. In 1949 Mosler was appointed to a lectureship at the \\"Walter Ulbricht\\" Law Academy (\\"Deutsche Akademie für Staats- und Rechtswissenschaft...\\") in Forst Zinna. The lectureship was accompanied by a position as \\"Party secretary\\" at the academy. In 1951 he completed a three month teacher training course at Eberswalde for university teaching for the important Marxist-Leninist Sociological Studies curriculum. That opened the way for a transfer to the Karl Marx University at Leipzig which was one of the top universities in East Germany, with a particular focus on critical political subjects such as Journalism and History. =Leipzig years= In 1951 Mosler accepted a lectureship in Marxist- Leninist Sociological Studies at the university's Institute for Journalism and Newspaper Studies. This was accompanied by a parallel appointment as a member of the party leadership group at the university's wide-ranging Philosophy Faculty. In 1953 he became director and a lecturer on the History of the German Labour Movement at the university's Franz Mehring Institute. On 22 March 1958 he received his doctorate in return for a dissertation on \\"The Strike of the Port Workers and Seamen in Hamburg-Altona 1896/97\\". The work was produced under the supervision of Professors Ernst Engelberg and Walter Markov. Following receipt of his doctorate Mosler accepted a professorship, still at the Karl Marx University of Leipzig, with the focus of his teaching still on the History of the Labour Movement. Between 1959 and 1964 he served as Prorector for Marxist-Leninist Sociological Studies and First Deputy University Rector. In 1961 he resigned from his role as director of the university's Franz Mehring Institute, and in the same year became a member of the Senate Commission on Social Sciences. In 1966 he accepted a teaching professorship in the History of the German Labour Movement at the national Marxism-Leninism Institute. In 1969 he undertook a five month leave of absence in order to undertake a piece of study at the University of Kiev on the History of the Soviet Communist Party. Mosler's teaching work continued to be complemented by various administrative and political positions and responsibilities. Between 1959 and 1968 he was a member of the party leadership team (\\"SED-Kreisleitung\\") at the Karl Marx University. He also served, between 1958 and 1970, as a member of the Leipzig District Council (\\"Abgeordneter des Bezirkstages Leipzig\\"): he also chaired the council's Commission on Popular Education (\\"... Kommission Volksbildung\\"). On a national level, between 1971 and 1978 he belonged to the Commission for the Theology Section at the Ministry for Higher Education and Vocational Training (\\"Ministerium für das Hoch- und Fachschulwesen...\\"). In addition, from 1965 he was a member of the \\"Kulturbund\\", a state-backed all-embracing umbrella organisation to which a large number of East German arts and culture-related organisations in need of approval were affiliated. The \\"Kulturbund\\" was a mass organisation which under the centralised Leninist power structure in force, and subject to the relentless control of the ruling SED (party), enjoyed some of the characteristics and privileges of a political party. It was as a representative delegate from the \\"Kulturbund\\" that Lothar Mosler held both his membership of the Leipzig District Council and, from as far back as 1959, his membership of the prestigious \\"Urania\\" East German Society for the Dissemination of Academic Knowledge. Lothar Mosler retired from his professorship on 1 September 1978.

The album was released in 1992. Background The album was recorded at the sixteenth annual gala of the Richard Tucker Music Foundation, a charity which supports American opera singers in their training and in beginning their careers. (The Foundation was set up in memory of Richard Tucker (1913-1975), an American operatic tenor, by his widow, children, friends and colleagues.) The gala was televised in the United States by PBS. Recording The album was digitally recorded at a live performance on 10 November 1991 in the Avery Fisher Hall, New York City.A Salute to American Music, cond. James Conlon, RCA Victor Red Seal CD, 09026-61508-2, 1992 Packaging The cover of the album, designed under the art direction of J. J. Stelmach, features Flag (1954-1955) by Jasper Johns, a 42¼\\" x 60⅝\\" encaustic painting made of oil and collage on fabric mounted on plywood. The painting is in the Museum of Modern Art, New York City, to which it was given by Philip Johnson in honour of Alfred H. Barr, Jr. Critical reception Leontyne Price photographed by Jack Mitchell in 1994 Peter Dickinson reviewed a disc of excerpts from the album in Gramophone in June 1993. The Richard Tucker Music Foundation's sixteenth gala was, he wrote, in the words of its conductor, \\"a look at an era just gone by\\". It was launched by one of its most senior contributors, Leontyne Price, with a Broadway-style arrangement of \\"America the Beautiful\\". (Oddly, the CD's insert booklet denied the hymnodist Samuel Augustus Ward his due credit as the song's composer.) Even \\"at the age of 63, she [could] still summon enough patriotic fervour to make non-Americans want to apply for citizenship papers on the spot\\".Dickinson, Peter: Gramophone, June 1993, p. 93 Kurt Weill made the first of his two appearances on the record in the \\"ecstatic virtuosity\\" of the Ice Cream Sextet from Street Scene, a work which had lately become more salient after a staging at the English National Opera and the release of cast albums by Decca and TER. The composer was not quite as well served by the 74-year-old Robert Merrill, who sang \\"touchingly\\" in \\"September Song\\" from Knickerbocker Glory but who was infuriatingly out of synchrony with James Conlon's orchestra. A single poem by William Blake, curiously, featured in the gala twice. His famous Tiger burned bright both in a song from Virgil Thomson's 1951 Five Songs from William Blake - one of two settings of Blake's text that Thomson had composed - and in William Bolcom's \\"The Tyger\\". It was Bolcom's version that was greeted more warmly, \\"bringing the house down\\" with an array of percussion instruments revelling behind chanting choristors. James Conlon Profounder depths of feeling were plumbed by Samuel Barber and Stephen Foster. The \\"polished nostalgia\\" of \\"Must the winter come so soon?\\" from Barber's Vanessa might be somewhat \\"calculating\\", but it was sung \\"hauntingly\\" by Frederica von Stade. Carol Vaness sang \\"Give me my robe\\" from Barber's Antony and Cleopatra with \\"equal poignancy\\". And Stephen Foster's \\"Ah, may the red rose live always\\" received one of the concert's most affecting performances from Karen Holvik, accompanied simply by Steven Blier's piano. Leonard Bernstein was the one composer given the accolade of being heard in three different compositions. The ensemble \\"Make our garden grow\\" represented Candide, one of his Chichester Psalms was sung by an \\"on form\\" Collegiate Chorale and Jerry Hadley sang \\"Maria\\" from West Side Story in a voice that went \\"a bit over the top intonationally\\" at the peak of its erotic rhapsodizing. And two of America's other great mezzo-sopranos followed in the wake of von Stade. Tatiana Troyanos performed Robert Lowry's \\"At the River\\", in its arrangement by Aaron Copland, with \\"impressive, quiet dignity\\". And \\"finally, in case you didn't sign on for US citizenship, Marilyn Horne [gave] a truly commanding performance\\" of Irving Berlin's ageless \\"God Bless America\\". All in all, Dickinson concluded, it was not enough merely to say that the gala, recorded before \\"an enthusiastic audience\\", was a success. \\"It's a wow!\\" The album was also reviewed in Classic CDClassic CD, Issues 32-37, 1993, p. 10 and in Fanfare.Fanfare, Vol. 16, Issue 4, 1993, p. 349 Track listing, CD1 * 1 (0:!8) Introduction Samuel A.

There were proposals to postpone local elections until early 1954 over fears of reduced turnout due to a conflicted schedule. The proposals were considered by the Minister of Internal Affairs William Bodkin, who ultimately decided against it. The one-term incumbent mayor Brian Hewat sought another term, but was defeated for the position in a challenge from three-term Invercargill Borough Councillor Adam Adamson.

As an amateur, competing for Solna BK, Persson won all of his eleven fights, nine by knockout, but in his last amateur fight he broke his thumb, leading him to miss the national final and he and was subsequently unable to box for a year.Harry Persson, Svenskt biografiskt lexikon, Svenskt Biografiskt Lexikon: 7113 He subsequently decided to turn professional through a showcase organized by Bro IK in Upplands-Bro.

By the end of 1925 he had built up a record of 19 wins, including victories over Giuseppe Spalla, Harry Reeve, Belgian champion Jack Humbeeck, and Larry Gains, 1 draw, and a single defeat at the hands of Piet van der Veer.

Biography  Hiary was born in Amman, Jordan in 1969. Before acquiring her academic training, she had already been exhibiting as a self-trained artist for about a decade, beginning in the late 1980s. Hiary completed a BA in Political Science and Sociology at University of Jordan in 1990, and later completed an additional BA of Fine Art in printmaking at Amman’s Al Zaytoonah University in 2004. Since the mid 1990s, she has been featured in solo and group shows in the Middle East, Europe,USA and the North America and Asia, while contributing to symposiums workshops and biennales. Although primarily a painter, she has also produced a number of video works and installations, several of which have been exhibited internationally. Among many other professional affiliations, Hiary and serves on competition juries, including for film festivals and contests. Her focus on the region’s political and social battles and their effect on her have featured prominently in her art. Hiary's work is characterized by multi-colored patterns and shapes, which are combined to showcase emotions and relationships; some personal, such as between a single mother and child, but most of them are social or political, such as depictions of women's oppression, or the experiences of Syrian refugees, especially the women among them. Her work has evolved and changed over the years, moving in and out of abstract and figurative works, but remains in both styles marked by her strong lines and bright colors, using elements of expressionism, pop-art, and primitivism. In addition to her painting on canvas, Hiary also creates murals, video art, and installations. In 2016, she took part in a travelling art collection known as The Bridge, which brought together 47 artists of Muslim, Christian and Jewish backgrounds. The collection featured her painting The Straight Line, which she described as \\"It is the clear straight line… the way most people in my homeland Jordan were raised to respect all religions.

Life Şehzade Mehmed was born on 11 March 1605 in Istanbul. He was the second son of Sultan Ahmed I. His mother was Kösem Sultan. In January 1609, Mehmed began his education under the guardianship of Hace Ömer Efendi, together with his elder brother, Şehzade Osman (future Sultan Osman II). According to contemporary European observers, Mehmed's mother Kösem entertained ideas about his succession to the sultanate after the death of Ahmed. Nasuh Pasha, during his grand vizierate (1611-14), especially after his marriage to Ayşe Sultan, daughter of Ahmed and Kösem in 1612, became a close ally of his mother-in-law, who apparently thought that Nasuh Pasha could be of help in securing the succession of Mehmed. After his father's death in 1617, when Mehmed was twelve years old, his uncle Sultan Mustafa I ascended the throne. However, he was soon deposed and replaced by Osman in 1618. Death Osman had asked the Şeyhülislam Hocazade Esad Efendi for an affirmative legal opinion to execute his brother. However, Esad Efendi refused to issue legal opinion. The Chief Judge of Rumeli Kemaleddin Efendi instead affirmed the execution of the prince. And so on 12 January 1621, Mehmed was executed. When the executors were stretching rope in his neck he spoke: Twelve days following his death, a harsh snow fall in Istanbul which was considered as Allah’s message to Osman that he killed his brother. Osman ordered Mehmed's execution before leaving the capital for the Polish campaign. He was buried beside his father in his mausoleum located in Blue Mosque, Istanbul. In popular culture In 2015 Turkish historical non-fiction TV series Muhteşem Yüzyıl: Kösem, Şehzade Mehmed is portrayed by Turkish Actor Burak Dakak.

It debuted at the 2018 San Francisco International Asian American Film Festival and was released theatrically by ABS-CBN on December 7, 2018 and on home video by Gravitas Ventures on October 1, 2019. The film follows Declan (Jon Norman Schneider) as he returns to his hometown of San Francisco for Christmas only to realize that his second oldest brother, Troy (Patrick Epino) has been ruling the house with fear, physically abusing his wife, Shelly (Theresa Navarro) and emotionally abusing his mother and daughter, Mina (Amelie Anima). When oldest brother Moe (Brian Rivera) arrives to complete the Christmas reunion, the festivities begin as the extended family shows up and the big Filipino Christmas can begin. But when cousin Tiva (L.A. Renigen) offers domestic violence support to the withdrawn Shelly, abusive Troy finds out and assaults Shelly for Declan and Moe to find when they get home. The next day, Declan and Moe are disturbed to discover that everyone in the house (Prisa, Shelly, Mina and Troy) all act as if nothing happened, even as Shelly nurses a bruised face. This leads Declan to propose a radical idea to the family: to kill Troy. The screenplay was based on Mendoza's experiences with physical abuse in his nuclear family as well as his extended family, originally written in 1997 under the title He Ain't Heavy, He's My Brother based on the song by The Hollies. On December 11, 2019, Bitter Melon was named one of \\"The 20 Best Bay Area Movies of the Decade\\" by The Mercury News after having placed on numerous \\"Best of 2018\\" lists. Themes Mendoza has said that the script for Bitter Melon is his \\"only screenplay that doesn’t pass the Bechdel test, and for good reason. It’s a movie about how men treat women.” The commentary track on the home video release has Mendoza explaining that every seemingly random conversation in the film examines masculinity from different angles; from toxic masculinity in the household, to the perception of masculinity in the LGBT community, to the future of masculinity in the wake of its patriarchal past. Music This is the first feature film directed by H.P. Mendoza to not be completely scored by him. His original intention was to have a \\"needle drop film\\" with a soundtrack consisting only of licensed music from his childhood, mixing local heroes like Carlos Santana with 60's R&B; groups like The Delfonics as well as actual 1950's recordings of Filipino folk songs by Bayanihan Philippine National Folk Dance Company. But the most crucial \\"needle drop\\" for Mendoza was the use of the song \\"He Ain't Heavy, He's My Brother\\" by The Hollies. After several attempts by music supervisor Terri D'Ambrosio to clear the rights to the actual song, the publishers of the song closed the door on the deal leaving Mendoza with no choice but to write his own musical number (\\"Wind Chime\\") for the finale of the film. Mendoza could not clear the rights for any of the American songs, but was able to secure all of the Filipino folk songs. The rest of the songs were replaced by a new original score that both Mendoza and Marco D'Ambrosio co-composed. Budget The film was initially funded by Cinematografo, an initiative created by ABS-CBN to grant $100,000 to Filipino- American filmmakers, but during production, H.P. Mendoza's production company, Ersatz Film, raised $100,000 more dollars, half of which was raised on Kickstarter where it was featured as one of Kickstarter's \\"Projects We Love\\". Critical reception On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, Bitter Melon holds an approval rating of 86% based on 7 reviews, with top critic Dennis Harvey of Variety calling the film \\"H.P. Mendoza's best directorial feature to date\\" while top critic Ben Kenigsberg of The New York Times called the film \\"absorbing\\" and \\"distinguished by its willingness to [go] to some disturbing places\\" but criticized the film for \\"grind[ing] to a halt in its final third as the characters talk things out, which might be helpful in life but in drama tends to belabor the obvious.\\" In a 50/50 review from Film Threat, Norm Gidney says, \\"There are scenes of utter brilliance and honesty, then clunky scenes of melodrama the next\\" while Tim Sika of the San Francisco Film Critics Circle called the film \\"an indie masterpiece\\" and \\"an absolutely beautiful movie about monsters and how they're made.\\" =Best of Lists= * The 20 Best Bay Area Movies of the Decade - The Mercury News * Best Films of 2018 - San Francisco Film Critics Circle * Best Films of the Asian Diaspora 2018 - Polygon * Best Movies of 2018 - Bay Area Reporter * Best of 2018 - Entropy * 31 Favorite Films of Outfest 2018 - The Advocate * Top 10 Films of CAAMFEST - San Francisco Chronicle * 5 Movies to See at CAAMFEST - Marin Independent Journal * Must See Films at SDAFF - San Diego Reader * Top 12 Fims at Newfest - Gay City News * Top Films at TFF - Wichita Eagle * Top Movie Picks - SF Land * Inspiring FilAms of 2018 - Philippine News Agency Awards * Best Narrative Feature - San Diego Asian Film Festival 2018 * Outstanding Ensemble Cast - Tallgrass Film Festival Home media Bitter Melon is available on Special Edition Blu-ray and DVD as well as in Digital HD via Gravitas Ventures on October 1, 2019.

The film was released on 7 February 2020. Plot The film is based on the love story of Shanti (Sadia Khateeb) and Shiv Dhar , who are Hindu Kashmiris in the backdrop of the Exodus of Kashmiri Hindus from Kashmir.

In an interview later, he mentioned that almost entirely film was shot in Kashmir. Initially in Summer, then in autumn and again in Winter. Only refugee camps were recreated in Mumbai and some sequences in Agra, but this part of story is brief. Shots in Kashmir included several places such as the Lalit Hotel in Srinagar, on shikaras in the middle of a lake, on the backwaters of the Dal, in a desolate Hindu house, near Hazratbal and many more. Some scenes were reported to be shot in Wandhama near Ganderbal, where one of the biggest massacre in the Valley, 23 Kashmiri Hindus — four children, nine women and ten men were massacred in 1998. =Casting= Lead characters of Kashmiri birth, Aadil Khan and Sadia were cast to lend authenticity. Several Kashmiri Pandits were selected for principal cast. Also, to make refugee camps as similar as possible to the real ones 30 years ago (19 January 1990), actual refugees were cast. Approximately 4,000 out of 400,000 refugees, who are currently inhabitants of Jagti Nagrota Migrant Camp and other refugee camps agreed to take part. They were women, children and older people. Refugee camp scenes were shot for several days and nights in Bhagwati Nagar,Jammu.  Release  The film was released on 7 February 2020. It was released digitally on April 4, 2020 on Amazon Prime Video in India. This film was criticized and even boycotted by some people for focusing on the \\"romantic love story\\" rather than the forced exodus of Kashmiri Hindus.  Reception  = Critical response = The Times of India gave the movie 3 out of 5 stars, and called it largely a one-sided story which does cater to the cinematic appeal of certain movie- goers.Pallabi Dey Purkayastha (7 February 2020). . The Times of India. Jyoti Kanyal of India Today also gives the movie 3 out of 5 stars and writes that the story \\"beautifully combines real incidents and a fictional love story\\". Both TOI and India Today praise debutantes Sadia and Aadil Khan. Newslaundry reviews the film as a successful love story but a failed political drama. The Hindu gives a more critical review, saying that \\"Chopra buries politics under the garb of ‘love and hope’\\" and ends up making the movie simplistic. Livemint also comments on the 'simplification of politics behind the exodus' in the movie. Nandini Ramnath of Scroll.in also writes a similar review, weak in history, strong in love. Firstpost also gave the movie 3 out of 5 stars. Music The film score was composed by A. R. Rahman and his apprentice group Qutub-E-Kripa. This marked Rahman's first collaboration with Vidhu Vinod Chopra, 26 years after Rahman declined an offer by Chopra in 1994.

He was one of the first five students of Brahmavidyalaya at Santiniketan. He passed the Entrance examination in 1904, and proceeded to USA, along with the poet's son Rathindranath Tagore, to study agriculture at the University of Illinois.Bose, Anjali (editor), 2004, Sansad Bangali Charitabhidhan (Biographical dictionary) Vol 2, , p 560, (set) and (Vol 2). He graduated in agriculture and animal husbandry, and set up a dairy farm on return to India. The business venture failed and Rabindranath absorbed him as a teacher in Santiniketan. He was nominated as a member of the Executive Council of Visva-Bharati in 1919. When the Palli Samgathana Vibhaga (Institute of Rural Reconstruction) was set up at Sriniketan in 1922, he was posted there. In the absence of the director, Leonard Knight Elmhirst, he was given administrative charge of Sriniketan. He was given charge of Siksha Satra in 1924. He was a good actor and participated in Tagore's plays. He collected many Santali songs and translated them into Bengali and English.

The Joint Monitoring Programme for Water Supply and Sanitation estimate that in 2018 60% of the total population were dependent on groundwater point sources for their main drinking water source: 73% in rural areas and 45% in urban areas.Joint Monitoring Programme for Water Supply, Sanitation and Hygiene (2019). Estimates on the use of water, sanitation and hygiene in Nigeria. The cities of Calabar and Port Harcourt are totally dependent on groundwater for their water supply. In 2013, there were around 65,000 boreholes in Nigeria extracting an estimated 6,340,000 m3/day.JICA (2014). The project for review and update of Nigeria national water resources master plan; Vol.2.Ministry of Water Resources (2013). National Water Resources Master Plan The majority of these (almost 45,000) were equipped with hand pumps and used for water supply in rural areas and small towns. Estimates of total renewable groundwater resources in Nigeria are variable. The United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) estimates that Nigeria has 87,000 Million m3/year of renewable groundwater resources.FAO (2016). AQUASTAT Main Database. Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) estimate that total annual groundwater recharge is 155,800 Million m3/year. Recharge is variable across the country and largely controlled by climate: recharge is lower in the north of the country due to higher evapotranspiration and lower rainfall.  Groundwater Environments =Geology= The geology of Nigeria includes large areas where Precambrian basement rocks are present at the ground surface, and other large areas where the basement rocks are overlain by younger sedimentary rocks.Tijani M, Crane E, Upton K, Ó Dochartaigh BÉ and Bellwood-Howard I (2018). Africa Groundwater Atlas: Hydrogeology of Nigeria. British Geological Survey. Accessed 26 August 2019Adelana SMA, Olasehinde PI, Bale RB, Vrbka P, Edet AE and Goni IB (2008). An overview of the geology and hydrogeology of Nigeria. In: Adelana, S.M.A. and MacDonald, A.M. Applied Groundwater Studies in Africa. IAH Selected Papers in Hydrogeology Volume 13. Taylor & Francis, London, UK. In the north west, these sedimentary rocks largely consist of Tertiary and Cretaceous rocks of the Sokoto Basin (the south eastern part of the Iullemmeden Basin), which are made up of varying amounts of sandstone and clay, with lesser amounts of limestone. In the north east, Tertiary and Quaternary rocks of the Chad Basin comprise sandstone, siltstone and shale. In the centre of Nigeria, along the course of the Benue and Niger rivers, are Tertiary and Cretaceous sedimentary rocks of the Benue and Nupe Basins. The Benue Basin consists of continental sandstones overlain by marine and estuarine shales and limestones, while the Nupe Basin largely contains continental sandstones, siltstones, claystones and conglomerates. Along the coast, within the Niger Delta Basin, there are significant unconsolidated sediments of Tertiary to Quaternary age, comprising coarse to medium grained unconsolidated sands and gravels with thin peats, silts, clays and shales. Hydrogeology of Nigeria at 1:5 Million Scale =Basement Aquifers= The basement rocks generally form low to moderate productivity aquifers where groundwater flow is concentrated in fractures, and often in a weathered mantle, which can develop in the upper few to tens of metres. Boreholes within basement aquifers are typically drilled to depths of 10–70 m, depending on local conditions. Water quality in these aquifers is generally good. =Sedimentary Aquifers= Rocks in the lower, more southerly part, of the Benue Basin form moderately productive aquifers where groundwater flow is concentrated in fractures. Borehole yields typically vary from 2 to 8 litres per second (l/s), but can be much higher or lower than this depending on the degree of fracturing and weathering. Aquifers tend to be localised and unconfined, with boreholes ranging from 40 to 150 m deep. Groundwater from these aquifers can be highly mineralised. Rocks in the Upper Benue Basin typically form low to moderate productivity aquifers, with borehole yields varying between 1 and 5 l/s. Groundwater flow is largely intergranular and boreholes can vary in depth from 30 to 300 m. Groundwater quality is generally good. Rocks in the Nupe Basin form low to moderately productive aquifers. Groundwater flow predominantly occurs through pore spaces in the rocks, which are generally fine grained and slightly cemented, limiting groundwater potential. Where coarser sandstones dominate, yields of 2 to 4 l/s can be achieved; basal conglomerate beds may support higher yields. Borehole yields in rocks of the Sokoto Basin are highly variable, but can be moderate to highly productive where coarser sandstones dominate. Lower sandstones can be confined while upper sandstone layers are typically unconfined. The Chad Formation, found in the Chad Basin, forms a moderate to highly productive aquifer, with yields up to 30 l/s recorded. Groundwater flow is largely intergranular and aquifers can be unconfined or confined depending on local conditions. Deeper sandstone layers are often confined. The Gombe Formation, also in the Chad Basin, has much lower permeability providing yields of around 1 to 5 l/s. Natural water quality from both these formations is generally good. =Igneous Aquifers= Volcanic rocks also occur in Nigeria, forming low to moderately productive aquifers. Borehole yields are typically less than 3 l/s and may be drilled to depths of around 15 to 50 m. =Unconsolidated Aquifers= Unconsolidated rocks, which predominantly occur in the coastal Niger Delta Basin and along major river valleys, form high to very high productivity aquifers. Alluvial aquifers are largely unconfined with shallow water tables and are thickest (15 – 30 m) along the rivers Niger and Benue. In the Niger Delta Basin, the upper Deltaic Formation is unconsolidated and largely unconfined with a shallow water table (0–10 m below ground level).Offodile ME (2002). Groundwater study and development in Nigeria. Mecon Services Ltd, Jos, Nigeria. The older Benin Formation is partly consolidated. It is largely unconfined (locally confined by lower permeability beds) with a water table typically between 3 and 15 m below ground level, but can be as much as 55 m deep. Aquifers in the Niger Delta Basin can provide yields from 3 to 60 l/s with borehole depths ranging from 10 to 800 m. Recharge is mostly directly from rainfall. Water quality issues include salinity, due to intrusion of sea water, iron, and pollution from human activities, particularly in urban areas. Groundwater Issues =Groundwater Availability= A 1996 survey by the Ministry of Water Resources found only 63% of boreholes in Nigeria were in working order, with many out of action due to pump failure. There are local issues of over-abstraction of groundwater, causing lowering of groundwater levels and, in some cases, land subsidence. These are mainly in unconsolidated aquifers in urban areas in the coastal plain in the south, including in Lagos and Port Harcourt. There are issues with drought causing lowering of groundwater levels, both seasonally in dry seasons, and during longer-term periods of low rainfall. This is particularly an issue for local, low storage basement aquifers, both in the north where rainfall is low and in the south, where rainfall is high. The potential impact of climate change on groundwater levels, combined with changing water demand, is recognised in the National Water Resources Master Plan. =Groundwater Quality= Groundwater pollution related to human activities (agriculture, domestic waste, industry) are issues in shallow aquifers, particularly permeable unconsolidated deposits, which have little protection from surface activities. Natural groundwater quality issues have also been recorded. Examples of this include high salinity in shallow alluvial aquifers due to dissolution of evaporate minerals and high iron and manganese concentrations in confined aquifers with low dissolved oxygen (i.e. anaerobic).British Geological Survey & WaterAid. 2003. Groundwater Quality: Nigeria. WaterAid Groundwater Quality Factsheets by Country =Transboundary Groundwater= There are several transboundary aquifers in Nigeria: # The Iullemeden, Taoudeni/Tanezrout Aquifer Systems (ITAS), shared by Algeria, Benin, Burkina Faso, Mali, Mauritania, Niger and Nigeria. # The Chad Basin Aquifer, shared by Cameroon, Central African Republic, Chad, Niger and Nigeria. # The Keta Basin Aquifers, shared by Ghana, Togo, Benin and Nigeria. # The Benue Trough, shared by Cameroon and Nigeria # The Rio Del Rey Basin, shared by Cameroon and Nigeria along the coast. The Lake Chad Basin Commission manages issues related to the Chad Basin and a mechanism for the management of the Iullemeden Basin is in development, following a Memorandum of Understanding for establishing an integrated water resources management mechanism for this aquifer.Memorandum of Understanding for the Establishment of a Consultation Mechanism for the Integrated Management of the Water Resources of the Iullemeden Taoudeni/Tanezrouft Aquifer Systems (ITAS) (Algeria, Benin, Burkina Faso, Mali, Mauritani, Niger, Nigeria), 2nd Council of Ministers of GICRESAIT Project, Abuja (Nigeria) 28 March 2014 Groundwater Management There are many bodies with responsibility for groundwater management in Nigeria. They include: * Nigeria Hydrological Services Agency (NIHSA) whose mandate is water resources (groundwater and surface water) assessment of the country; its quantity, quality, availability and distribution in time and space * Nigeria Integrated Water Resources Management Commission (NIWRMC) that is responsible for regulation of water use and allocation * The state Ministries of Water Resources and their Rural Water Supply and Sanitation Agencies (RUWATSSAN), responsible for provision of water to their various States * The National Water Resources Institute, a parastatal of the Federal Ministry of Water Resources, has responsibility for training, research and data management relating to water in general. * All the River Basin Development Authorities, which are also parastatals of the Federal Ministry of Water Resources involved in the provision of water supply to rural environments within their catchments. The Nigerian Association of Hydrogeologists (NAH) is the professional body concerned with due process and best practices in the exploration, development and management of Nigeria's water resources. The NAH disseminates information on the state of the nation's water resources through annual conferences and a journal, Water Resources. Through membership of the Hydrology and Hydrogeology Subcommittee of the National Technical Committee on Water Resources (NTCWR), the technical arm of the National Council of Water Resources (NCWR), the NAH contributes to the development of water resources policies and legislation, including the Water Resources Act 100 and the Nigerian Standard for Drinking Water Quality. The Nigeria Hydrological Services Agency (NIHSA), an agency of the Federal Ministry of Water Resources, has responsibility for groundwater monitoring. There is a national groundwater level monitoring programme with 43 monitoring points, 32 of which are equipped with data loggers. These are sited in basement and sedimentary aquifers. The frequency of monitoring at sites with data loggers is daily, and sometimes twice daily. NIHSA has implemented a programme of drilling new monitoring boreholes for monitoring groundwater level. The new boreholes so far are focussed on sedimentary aquifers used for urban water supply; with borehole depths of 80 to 100 m. The groundwater level monitoring data are stored at NIHSA headquarters in Abuja. The NIHSA is also responsible for water quality monitoring, but as yet a full programme is not in place due to lack of equipment. The National Water Resources Master Plan recognises current problems in the effective acquisition and management of groundwater data, and recommends strategies for improving this situation.

He was appointed Professor of Criminal Law at the Grandes écoles (Velika škola) in 1865. He participated in the work of the Constitutional Committee of 1868 and was noted for his eloquence and for suggesting that the government was to be placed under the control of the State Council, and not the Assembly. He was a politician of conservative orientation, sharing similar beliefs with older politicians such as Ilija Garašanin and Jovan Marinović. He was the leader of a group of young conservatives. In 1871, he became president of the Belgrade municipality but was soon overthrown by the Liberal deputy, headed by Jovan Ristić. He then opened his law practice in Belgrade, and from 1873 to 1874, he was Minister of the Interior in Prime Minister Marinović's cabinet. On 25 November 1874, Čumić replaced Marinović, who resigned, and became Prime Minister himself. As the government did not enjoy the confidence of the National Assembly, Čumić was replaced after another three months, on 22 January 1875. He was then appointed Judge of the Court of Cassation.

Family  He was the grandson of Aulus Verginius and the son of Aulus Verginius Tricostus Caeliomontanus, consul in 494 BC. His full name is Spurius Verginius A.f. Tricostus Caeliomontanus. Although there is some dispute as to who his son was: for example Titus Verginius Tricostus Caeliomontanus (consul 448) is either his nephew, son of his brother Aulus Verginius Tricostus Caeliomontanus (consul 469 BC), Consul in 469 BC or his own son.  Biography  In 456 BC he was consul with Marcus Valerius Maximus Lactuca. Their term took place during a period of tension between the plebs, represented by its tribunes who wanted the Aventine part of the state domain with the rogatio Terentilia, and the patricians, who opposed the plebs measure. Concessions were made and the tribune Icilius obtained the votes to pass it into law, the Lex Icilia de Aventino publicando, which divided the Aventine into building lots for the benefit of the plebs.Diodorus of Sicily, Universal History, XII, Titus Live, Roman History, Book III, 31.

The film was adapted from Jessica Pressler's 2015 article in New York magazine, \\"The Hustlers at Scores\\". Barbash hass written her own memoirs, entitled Underscore. Known professionally as Samantha Foxx, she became an adult entertainment host at 19 and later a hostess at Scores Gentlemen's Club in the Chelsea neighborhood of Manhattan and in the same borough's Hustlers Club. Many of their biggest spending clients were highly paid Wall Street brokers. After the Wall Street bubble collapsed it took more effort for Barbash, Keo and their friends to make money. So they started calling old clients, suggesting they meet up, in an ordinary bar or restaurant, for an ordinary date. However, at a key point, where the target had drunk enough to be suggestible, her friends would arrive, and suggest they go to a strip club. They had arrangements with certain strip clubs to get a generous kickback from the target's credit card bill. Once in a private room, at the strip club they would call rack up expensive charges on the target's credit card. Sometimes they would covertly drug the target to make him suggestible. The drug cocktail they used would also wipe the evening from the target's memory. Barbash was on probation for five years after pleading guilty of conspiracy, assault and grand larceny. Following her conviction, Barbash opened a spa offering cosmetic procedures and plastic surgery. In April 2019, Barbash announced she was going to try to stop the film's release, citing defamation and that the producers did not acquire the rights to tell her story. In April Barbash said she was flattered Jennifer Lopez was playing her. But, by the time the film was released she said that Cardi B, who played a smaller role in the film, would have been a better choice. Barbash sued Lopez's production company, for $40 million on January 7, 2020. Barbash said she still respects Lopez, personally. Bay January, 2020, there were concerns over her book, Underscore. Barbash's web-site allowed individuals who wanted to read the book to prepay, with publication coming in September 2019. Page Six magazine reported she had pre-sold 45,000 copies, and her share of this sale would be about $1 million, but that reader still had not received their books, prompting their headline \\"Has the woman who inspired ‘Hustlers’ run another $1 million hustle?\\".

Born in Swansea, Weakley completed an apprenticeship as a toolmaker with British Aerospace in Bristol, and joined the Amalgamated Engineering Union (AEU). He became a shop steward at Westland Helicopters, andslowly came to prominence in the union, associated with its right wing. In the mid-1970s, he took the union's president, Hugh Scanlon, to the High Court, successfully arguing that Scanlon should not use his casting vote in favour of the left- wing of the union's executive. Following his success in court, the right gained control of leading positions in the AEU, starting with John Boyd's 1975 election as general secretary. Weakley stood to become national organiser, but was defeated by Laurie Smith. Only in 1977 did he begin working full-time for the union, as its Wales and South West England District Secretary, then in 1979 he was elected to the union's executive committee. He was also made the union's chief negotiator with British Aerospace, British Steel and GEC. In 1985, Weakley was elected to the General Council of the Trades Union Congress (TUC). The following year, he hoped to become the president of the AEU, but the union's right-wing instead backed the more junior Bill Jordan. He thereafter focused on the TUC, becoming a founder member of its Executive Committee in 1994, and on the Confederation of Shipbuilding and Engineering Unions, serving as president in 1990/91. Jordan stood down as president of the AEU's successor, the Amalgamated Engineering and Electrical Union, late in 1994, and as the longest-serving member of the union's executive, Weakley was appointed as acting president. He announced his intention to run for the post, but died before the election took place.

It merged in 1999 with Oberaargau Regional Transport (Regionalverkehr Oberaargau; RVO), the Solothurn-Niederbipp Railway (Solothurn-Niederbipp-Bahn; SNB) and the Oberaargauische Automobilkurse (OAK) to form Aare Seeland mobil (ASm), which now operates the 21 km-long, metre-gauge Biel–Täuffelen–Ins railway.  History Certificate for 4 shares worth 250 francs each in the Seeländische Lokalbahnen, issued on 15 January 1918 The company was founded as the Seeländische Lokalbahnen (Seeland local railway; SLB) in 1912 with its headquarters in Täuffelen. The first section of the line from Nidau to Siselen was opened on 4 December 1916 and the section from Siselen to Ins followed on 19 March 1917. Since the line ends in Ins next to the standard-gauge line of the Bern–Neuchâtel railway (BN), a transporter wagon yard was opened at the same time for the carriage of standard gauge freight cars on the metre-gauge line. The last section between Nidau and the station forecourt (Bahnhofplatz) followed on 21 August 1926. A transporter wagon system was opened here, too; wagon could be delivered to any point on the whole line. The Biel–Täuffelen–Ins line remained the only line of the Seeländische Lokalbahnen. The Seeländische Lokalbahnen was renamed the Biel-Täuffelen-Ins- Bahn (Biel-Täuffelen-Ins Railway, BTI) as of 1 September 1945. The cooperation between the Oberaargau-Jura railway (Oberaargau-Jura-Bahnen, OJB) and the Solothurn-Niederbipp Railway (Solothurn-Niederbipp-Bahn, SNB), which had existed for some time, was regulated by contract from 1960. The new underground approach of the Biel-Täuffelen-Ins line to Biel/Bienne station was opened on 22 May 1975. This allowed the dismantling of the line that had run along streets under the large SBB railway bridge to Biel station forecourt. The underground station reduced the distance to the Swiss Federal Railways (SBB) trains and the station forecourt was cleared, allowing it to be rebuilt. An early indication of the later merger was a formal agreement that was contracted on 5 April 1984 between the BTI, the OJB, the SNB, the Oberaargauischen Automobilkurse (a bus company; OAK), the Ligerz-Tessenberg- Bahn (a funicular railway; LTB) and the Bielersee-Schiffahrts-Gesellschaft (Lake Biel Ferry Company; BSG) under the name of Oberaargau-Solothurn-Seeland- Transport (OSST). The first of seven low-floor GTW Be 2/6 articulated railcars was put into operation in 1997. The majority of the participants of Oberaargau-Solothurn-Seeland-Transport were merged to form Aare Seeland mobil (ASm) in 1999. The Ligerz-Tessenberg-Bahn joined only in 2003, while the Bielersee-Schiffahrts-Gesellschaft still remains legally independent.  Route The line runs largely on its own right of way, although the line runs for a few hundred metres on public roads. The steepest section at 4.7 percent is located between the stations of Ins and Ins Dorf. The BTI ends under Biel SBB station, which is the hub of four SBB lines. The Biel–Grenchen–– and Biel––Yverdon-les-Bains– lines together form the line known as the Jura Foot Railway. The Biel/Bienne–Bern and the Biel/Bienne–La Chaux-de-Fonds lines also connect at the station.  RegioTram planning  There is a Regiotram agglomeration Biel/Bienne project, in which the BTI line would in future be extended as a tram through Biel SBB station and through the city to Bözingenfeld railway station. Thus, the most important development areas (living, work, leisure) of the region would be connected without the need to change trains. With a total length of 27 kilometres, the line would be the longest tram line in Switzerland. The project was stopped by a government enquiry on 26 March 2015.

It stars Zachary Ray Sherman, Timothy V. Murphy, Sally Kirkland and Monique Parent. The film had its world premiere at the Cleveland International Film Festival on March 28, 2019 and it was released on October 4, 2019. Plot Ronnie, a loner who lives with his possessive mother, is deemed unfit for military service due to his history of mental instability and petty crime. Retreating into the world of extremist internet groups, he creates a vlog channel, from which he decries what he describes as the downfall of \\"real America.\\" Meanwhile, prompted by sexual frustration, he agrees to play the role of cuckold in a couple's homemade amateur pornography, unaware they are exploiting him. He buys an unregistered handgun and begins to spend time at firing ranges. He meets his online idol, a charismatic leader of the alt-right. However, when his identity as a \\"cuck\\" emerges, his macho persona is destroyed. Facing online shaming, Ronnie takes solace in his gun, which he regards as the only symbol of masculinity he has left.  Cast   Production  = Development = Following several collaborative screenwriting projects, Lambert and Varkle set out to produce a feature film. Beginning in 2016, they outlined several projects that would support a close character study of an isolated individual. Inspired by headlines of mass shooters brainwashed by online hate groups, they opted to tell an \\"angry young man\\" story. The filmmakers researched online communities of self-described \\"red pillers\\" and \\"incels\\" in order to make their character realistic and relatable. Lambert and Varkle began writing the screenplay in May 2017. The first draft was completed in July 2017; the script was submitted to the Black List in September 2017. The script received polarizing reviews, with many critics divided over its frank portrayal of hate and sexuality. Lambert and Varkle were later interviewed by the Black List after the film began production. = Casting = Lambert and Varkle screened actors who could balance vulnerability with volatility, ultimately settling on Zachary Ray Sherman, who gained forty-five pounds for the role.  Release  On June 19, 2019, it was announced that Gravitas Ventures had acquired the North American distribution rights for the film. The film was officially released in select theaters and through VOD services on October 4, 2019.  Reception  = Critical response = On Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 44% based on 16 reviews, with a weighted average of 4.81/10. On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 40 out of 100, based on five critics, indicating \\"mixed or average reviews\\". Variety praised the \\"strong performances and atmosphere\\" of the film but described Cuck as an \\"overlong\\" and \\"downbeat drama\\" with a \\"contrived\\" plot. The Guardian writer Charles Bramesco favored Cuck to Todd Phillips' 2019 film Joker, calling it \\"more repellent, honest and astute than this week's odds-on box office champion.\\" The New York Times panned the film as \\"an ugly . . . and self-congratulatory wallow.\\" = Commercial response = The box office figures for Cuck have not been reported.

It was first described by Hippolyte Bernheim in 1910. Today it is questioned whether or not Bernheim Syndrome is its own syndrome or a side effect of other cardiac conditions such as left ventricular heart failure whereby the left ventricle is substantially enlarged which encroaches on the space of the right ventricle.  Etiology  Bernheim Syndrome is believed to be the rightward shift of the ventricular septum compressing the right ventricle without causing pulmonary congestion. This was first described by Hippolyte Bernheim in which he presents 10 patients with signs and symptoms of right sided heart failure whose postmortem autospy revealed a ventricular septum that invaded the right ventricle space. This opposed the traditional view of right sided heart failure, right ventricular hypertrophy, where the right ventricle is enlarged. Bernheim describes right ventricles the size of a slit which was due to the bulging ventricular septum wall. Bernheim Syndrome is believed to occur in two periods: the anatomic and clinical periods. In the anatomic period, there are no clinical signs of the syndrome but the stenosis of the right ventricle makes it difficult to fill to normal capacity. This is offset by the dilation of the right atrium as it takes in the difference in volume. In the clinical period, there are signs and symptoms present. In the clinical period, there are two stages. In the first stage, clinical signs of venous obstruction due to the right ventricular stenosis become apparent while pulmonary blood flow continues normally. In the second stage, symptoms of poor circulation become apparent such as systemic venous engorgement. It is at this point where the patient appears to be in heart failure. A normal view of right ventricle flow via cardiac MRI. In Bernheim Syndrome, the movement in the right ventricle is severely impaired.  Signs and symptoms  Signs and symptoms for Bernheim Syndrome are ill-defined and typically follow those of heart failure. Bernheim distinguished Bernheim Syndrome from the typical heart failure presentation via the engorgement of veins due to congestion without evidence of pulmonary congestion. This is evidence of venous blockage without going into pulmonary circulation and is therefore isolated to the right side of the heart. Case presentations of Bernheim Syndrome include symptoms of hypertension, ronchi in the lungs, edema, vein distention, and signs of poor perfusion. It is important for there to be no presentation of dyspnea nor pulmonary congestion until it is presumed to be a terminal stage of Bernheim Syndrome.  Diagnosis  Most cases of Bernheim Syndrome have been identified postmortem in necropsy. A cross-sectional view of the heart muscle will show a greatly reduced right ventricle size. In necropsy, it is typical for the heart and lungs to be weighed with a higher weight indicating a build up of blood in the lungs: pulmonary congestion. The weight of the lungs is therefore expected to be within normal limits to rule out pulmonary congestion (900-1,280g). The weight of the liver was also part of diagnosis with a significantly greater weight than what is in normal limits (1,440-1,680g) indicative of vein distention. In a clinical setting, Bernheim claims that the presence of isolated right ventricular failure clearly came first with the presence of left ventricular hypertrophy coming secondary indicates the presence of his syndrome. This is especially considered when the heart failure is not due to a weakness in the myocardium but instead stenosis of the myocardial wall. Fluoroscopy to view the blood flow in the heart has also been deemed a reliable tool. It would be expected for the left ventricle and right atrium to be enlarged with the other two chambers appearing \\"normal\\". However, it was typical to only confirm the presence of Bernheim Syndrome in the setting of autopsy.  Myth  It is believed by some in the medical community that Bernheim Syndrome does not actually exist and is only an observed side effect of another condition such as left ventricular hypertrophy. This is because of the lack of a finding of sole right ventricle compression without accompaniment of left ventricular hypertrophy which is expected to encroach into the right ventricular space. It is claimed that there is no observation of a rightward shift of the ventricular septum as is described by Bernheim. Furthermore, using evidence from right and left peak systolic pressures, they determined there was no evidence of right ventricular stenosis to begin with. When right ventricular heart failure is found without left ventricular heart failure, it was accompanied by pulmonary embolism and/or mitral valve stenosis. It is because of theses findings that there has been a movement to remove Bernheim Syndrome from medical terminology.

Many of the dead were Muslims themselves, but they had been targeted because of their presumed support of the Thai government.Data from the (governmental) Southern Border Provinces Administrative Centre, cited in ISRANews report, 4 January 2013 The creation of the 15th Infantry Division was announced in January 2005.Robert Karniol, 'Thailand boosts military in troubled south,' Jane's Defence Weekly, 23 February 2005, Vol. 42, No. 8, p. 12 Defence Minister, General Samphan Boonyanan, was quoted as saying that the new unit, dubbed the \\"Development Division\\", would not be a combat unit for fighting Islamic militants, but rather its main mission would be to assist local citizens and develop the region. The military will not ignore its general function of providing safety for the citizens of the region, he added. He said that troops for the new division would undergo training to give them a good understanding of local residents, the vast majority of whom are ethnic Malay Muslims. The division is in fact a transformation of the Pranburi-based 16th Infantry Division. It will now be headquartered at Fort Ingkhayutthaborihan in Pattani, complete with its battalions and companies of military police and communications and aviation personnel, he said. It will also have three separate infantry battalions, one each in Pattani, Yala, and Narathiwat. Each battalion will include three companies of medical, engineering, and psychological warfare personnel, he said. The government will allocate a budget of more than 18 billion baht for the division over the next four years.Asia Africa Intelligence Wire, New Thai army regiment to battle southern militants [sic – this is a division], BBC Monitoring International Reports, 16 February 2005. The 15th Infantry Division is being established as a permanent force to handle security problems in the Deep South. The division is based in Pattani and is expected to have a combined force of around 10,000. The establishment of this new division, approved by the government in 2005, has yet to be completed.

She was educated in University College Dublin where completed her teacher's diploma and got involved in the Irish Nationalist organisation Cumann na mBan partly through the advice of her mentor, Professor Boden. She joined with her sister Dr Honoria Aughney. Nationalism Nic Eachnaidh was involved in the Irish War of Independence. She was a member of Cumann na mBan and on the executive leadership. She founded the local branch of the cumann in Tullow and supported other Carlow branches.

She also became a member of the executive of Cumman na mBan then. During the period when she was working in Dublin at school, Nic Eachnaidh worked for the executive of the organisation and ran drills on first aid. Once the school was on holidays Nic Eachnaidh would travel either to locations which needed support or home to Carlow where she would ensure the coordination of the Carlow branches. Like all the women involved in the war, Nic Eachnaidh carried messages, hid and transported weapons and provided first aid services. Once the truce came into effect Nic Eachnaidh was one of the women against the acceptance of the articles of the Anglo-Irish Treaty she remained a believer in the idea of an independent Republic and she continued her activities in opposition to the Free State. In the aftermath of the Irish Civil War, Nic Eachnaidh remained involved working for pensions for those who had been in the various forces as well as looking for support for those prisoners who had been members of the IRA.Nic Eachnaidh was also chair of the Agricultural Wages Board from 1937.

Robertson had wide interests and one of these was horology – he wanted to provide the foundation of what we could call “horological engineering”, that is, a firm science-based approach to the design of accurate mechanical clocks. He contributed a long series on the scientific foundations of precision clocks to the Horological Journal which was the main publication for the trade in the UK; he and his students undertook research on clocks and pendulums (some funded by the Society of Merchant Venturers); and he designed at least one notable clock, to keep University time and control the chiming of Great George in the Wills Memorial Building from its inauguration on 1925, for which he also designed the chiming mechanism. Today, we get accurate time from atomic clock ensembles in observatories round the world, compared and distributed by GPS satellites and over the internet, and displayed on almost any public or personal screen. Accurate time has become ubiquitous and its maintenance a branch of information and communications technology. A century ago none of this existed, and the world depended on the pendulum clock to keep its time, referenced to astronomical observations. There was a scientific literature on the behaviour of pendulums and clocks; and a widespread craft-based industry making timepieces; but it could not be said that horology was a branch of engineering. Robertson became Professor of Electrical Engineering in Merchant Venturer’s Technical College in 1902. MVTC merged with University College Bristol when the latter was granted a Royal Charter in 1909 and became the engineering faculty of the new University of Bristol – Robertson then became the first professor of the subject in the faculty. He served in this post until his death in 1941. Clock-wise, the Shortt Synchronome Free Pendulum clock entered service at the Royal Observatory in 1923 and kept Greenwich, and therefore the nation’s, time until supplanted by quartz clocks in the 1940s. Throughout Robertson’s career therefore, pendulum time was paramount. Suppliers such as the Synchronome Company or Gents of Leicester could by 1925 have supplied perfectly satisfactory and well-proven systems to run the bell and slave clocks throughout the building. The fact that the University chose to commission a unique and original design is a tribute perhaps to its pride in the new building and to its distinguished Professor, who was able to put into practice the principles that he had developed. The Robertson Clock Originally mounted in an interior foyer of the Wills Memorial Building, Robertson's clock is housed in an oak case 1753 x 837 x 310 mm (h/w/d), originally carried on stout oak “dogs” let into the masonry of an internal wall. The case was also secured to the wall through its back, but does not support any of the mechanisms, which are separately mounted through the case back into the wall using studs. The opening front door is fully glazed. In its new home in Queen’s Building the original studs are re-mounted on to a large steel plate, firmly screwed to the reinforced concrete wall. At the top of the case a clock dial displays hours and minutes as kept by the pendulum. The dial is a standard Gents slave clock movement which is advanced by a pulse every 30s, counted down from seconds pulses generated by the pendulum. Additional circuits in the clock once generated other half-minute pulses that controlled 3 strings of similar slave clocks throughout the building. Right down the centre of the case is the pendulum, of the order of a metre long and with a period of 2 seconds. It is suspended from a bracket attached to a massive iron casting bolted through to the wall, which also carries the “escapement” mechanism to the right under the face. This drives the pendulum with a small impulse of force every second, generated by the drop of a small weight under the control of an electromagnet. Part of the mechanism includes a 60-tooth ratchet wheel advanced on every pendulum swing by a pawl driven by the electromagnet. Originally this operated a pair of contacts by two pins on its periphery to generate the half-minute pulses, but at some stage these contacts were removed. To the left of the pendulum is the regulator. This is arranged to apply a small force to the pendulum which through an ingenious linkage effectively works against gravity, slowing the pendulum down. The force comes from a torque generated by a spiral hair-spring, one end being attached to the pivot of a lever that forms part of the escapement linkage, the other to a disk that can be rotated in small steps by a solenoid-operated “stepper motor”. This allows the period of the pendulum to be adjusted by changing the torque, under the control of a system that compares the pendulum phase to a time standard (originally a daily pulse sent out over the telegraph network at 10.00 GMT). Behind the pendulum and near its top is a standard aneroid barometer, and below that a mercury thermometer. These would have been used when checking the clocks’ rate, which depends on both atmospheric temperature and pressure. To the left of the pendulum is the Civil Time Unit (CTU). This is essentially a clock that receives a pulse every second from the pendulum and keeps track of local time, GMT or BST depending on the season, to control the pulses sent to Great George to make it chime on the hours, 0700 through 2100 except Sundays. The CTU was driven by its own electromagnet. On the right is the Greenwich Time Unit (GTU), which essentially kept GMT by counting seconds impulses but also controlled the sequencing of the synchronising system around 10.00 am GMT every day. Again, the GTU had its own electromagnet drive. Behind the wall to which the clock was mounted there was a Control Box that housed several terminal frames, some relays, and ancillary components, that were connected to contacts on the TUs by wires going through the wall. Most of this has now been lost. The clock and its circuits were power by a 24 volt lead-acid battery, possibly also housed in this room. This Control Box has also been recovered and will be installed beside the clock case to house support electronics.

Bazz's credits also include work with various other notable musicians, including Charlie Musselwhite, Marc Ford, Mike Eldred, Top Jimmy, Ryan Bingham, and Lynwood Slim.  Early life  Bazz grew up in Downey, California. He was one of four children. His father, Jack, was born in Wyoming in 1923. The 1940 census shows Jack living in Los Angeles. He lived in the L.A. area for the rest of his life. The family name was originally Bazzanella. His grandfather, Giacomo, emigrated to the United States in 1905 and the surname was shortened.Foothills Genealogical Society website Bazz's neighbors in Downey were his future bandmates in The Blasters: Phil Alvin, Dave Alvin, and Bill Bateman. In a 1985 interview, he remembered that his family lived across the street from the Alvins, and that their mothers were friends before any of the boys were born. He said that in a sense, they were all brothers.  Career  = With the Blasters = In Make the Music Go Bang! (1997), Los Angeles music journalist Chris Morris described The Blasters circa 1980 and the \\"brute energy\\" that the band generated, including \\"the pump of bassist John Bazz.\\"Snowden, Don and Gary Leonard (editors) Make The Music Go Bang! The Early L.A. Punk Scene. Macmillan, Dave Alvin echoed Morris in another history of the L.A. punk scene, Under the Big Black Sun. Pointing to their mutual education in old American music of all kinds, he noted how \\"John Bazz pumping decades-old walking bass lines like they were brand new\\" contributed to the band's \\"undeniably manic, energetic magic.\\" A 2018 review of the band found that \\"[t]he hard-hitting rhythm section of drummer Bill Bateman and bassist John Bazz is propulsive and relentless\\". Along with frontman Phil Alvin, Bazz has been one of the two constants in the various lineups that The Blasters have assembled over their 40-year history. He remained in the rhythm section as of 2019, along with Bill Bateman. = Style and professional reputation = Bazz plays upright bass in addition to electric bass. One description called his approach \\"unwavering and relentless\\" and remarked on the \\"passion\\" and \\"unmistakable push\\" in his playing that prompts high demand for his services in sessions and gigs.ZOHO Music website One such assignment from a high-profile frontman came in 2002-03, when actor Bruce Willis handpicked Bazz to be in one of his musical side ventures, the Accelerators. Willis and band played for American troops in Iraq in September 2003 as part of the USO's \\"Touch of Home\\" tour. John Doe—an old friend, contemporary, and fellow bass player—put it like this in early 2020: \\"Every time I see [Bazz] play, I want to be him. He simply gets it.\\" Echoing Dave Alvin, Doe added, \\"He finds new ways to say something in rock ’n’ roll or roots music that may have already been said.\\" = Membership in other bands / musicianship = Starting around 2000, Bazz has also been a member of the Mike Eldred Trio, another roots-rock band. This group, led by guitarist Mike Eldred, became more active from 2010 on. A 2017 interview with Eldred noted the solid credibility that came from having Bazz and drummer Brian Fahey in the band; Eldred likened it to driving a Cadillac.

It produced several Tamil language films in the early 2000s, and was later acquired by Pentamedia Graphics.  History  Media Dreams was set up in 1997 as an Indian entertainment business unit catering to the television, theatre and the internet. It was acquired by Pentamedia Graphics in December 2000. The group's key partners included prominent writer Sujatha Rangarajan as its managing director. The studio's first feature film Bharathi, a biopic of poet Subramania Bharati, opened to critical and commercial acclaim, prompting the producers to take on several more projects in the early 2000s. Other notable films that the group made during the period included Cheran's family drama Pandavar Bhoomi (2001), Singeetam Srinivasa Rao's multilingual fantasy film Little John (2001) and Moulee's comedy drama Pammal K. Sambandam (2002) starring Kamal Haasan. The group also subsequently moved onto distribute films, make television serials such as Balu Mahendra's Kadhai Neram, and release audio albums. In early 2001, Media Dreams announced that they would produce Robo, a science fiction film by Shankar, starring Kamal Haasan and Preity Zinta in the lead roles. However, the film was later stalled due to escalating costs. The team had also announced that they would produce the film version of Sundara Ramaswamy's novel Oru Puliyamarathin Kathai, which would mark the directorial debut of art director P. Krishnamoorthy, but the project eventually did not materialise. The commercial failure of some of its films forced the group to stop making films, with its final release Whistle (2003), having a delayed release.

He has also played for the Flesh Eaters, the Red Devils, and the Cramps. In writing of the talent that the Blasters contained, Henry Rollins singled out Bateman as \\"one of the best drummers there is.\\"Rollins, Henry. Get in the Van: On the Road with Black Flag. 2.13.61 Publications, A peer drummer, Dennis Diken of the Smithereens, called Bateman in 1987 \\"one of the most electrifying drummers I've ever heard. His intensity and spirit make your jaw drop.\\" Early Life Bateman was born on December 16, 1951 in Orange, California. He grew up in Downey, California, where he was neighbors with his future bandmates in the Blasters: Phil Alvin, Dave Alvin, and John Bazz. As Dave Alvin recalled in 2014, they were all like brothers - and fought like brothers too. From boyhood, the quartet shared a deep and abiding love of all forms of American music, and they ventured together into Los Angeles blues clubs, learning from veterans. With the Blasters In Make the Music Go Bang! (1997), Los Angeles music journalist Chris Morris described the Blasters circa 1980 and the \\"brute energy\\" that the band generated, including \\"the indefatigable drummer Bill 'Buster' Bateman.\\"Snowden, Don and Gary Leonard (editors) Make The Music Go Bang! The Early L.A. Punk Scene. Macmillan, Dave Alvin echoed Morris in another history of the L.A. punk scene, Under the Big Black Sun. He noted how \\"Bill Bateman pounding his drums as if he were trying to kill the damn things\\" contributed to the band's \\"undeniably manic, energetic magic.\\" On occasion Bateman used large meat bones as drumsticks, as observed by Belinda Carlisle of the Go-Go's, with whom Bateman had a two-year relationship in the early 1980s.Carlisle, Belinda. Lips Unsealed: A Memoir. Three Rivers Press, 2011. (One photograph shows them playfully arm- wrestling.) Yet Bateman also possessed subtlety and rhythmic complexity. Pointing to their mutual education in old American music of all kinds, Phil Alvin said that he used to play a lot of country blues with just Bateman accompanying him, and that Bateman often practiced by playing along with country blues. It helped \\"explain the Blasters' ability to infuse borrowings from blues, country and soul music with the proper accents, the right touch.\\" Bateman is pictured on the cover of the 1983 album Non-Fiction, clad in mechanic's coveralls and bearing a rose. The Blasters played less frequently in the late '80s. In late 1988, Bateman began to devote more of his time to the Blue Shadows (later the Red Devils). Dave Carroll succeeded him as Blasters drummer in 1993 and was subsequently replaced by Jerry Angel in 1994. After playing on the reunion tours and albums that featured the original lineup in the early 2000s, Bateman rejoined the Blasters on a regular basis in 2008, replacing Jerry Angel. As of 2019, he remains in the lineup. With the Flesh Eaters Bateman, along with fellow Blasters members Dave Alvin and Steve Berlin, performed on the 1981 album A Minute to Pray, A Second to Die by the Los Angeles punk band the Flesh Eaters. This lineup, which also included John Doe and D.J. Bonebrake, assembled once again in 2006, performing three shows in California and one in England to mark the album’s 25th anniversary. They reunited briefly in 2015 for a five-show tour and again for an eight-show run in 2018. They issued a new album, I Used to Be Pretty, in 2019. With the Blue Shadows/Red Devils Los Angeles club King King (a former Chinese restaurant) opened in late 1988, and Bateman was one of the core members of the Blue Shadows, who took up a regular residence. They attracted the attention of producer Rick Rubin, who prompted them to switch names to the Red Devils. This group released the live album King King in 1992. They broke up in 1994. Bateman subsequently played in later incarnations of the Blue Shadows and the Red Devils. With the Cramps Bateman joined the long-running psychobilly band the Cramps in 2004 for a tour that started that summer. Guitarist Poison Ivy noted that they had known him for 20 years. The tour concluded that November, and then the Cramps went on another one of their extended hiatuses. When they reconvened in the summer of 2006, Bateman did a tour of Europe. For their last live shows, however, previous drummer Harry Drumdini was back with them.Porter, Dick Journey to the Center of the Cramps. Omnibus Press, 2015. Other activities In recent years, Bateman has performed with the band Electric Children in addition to the Blasters. He has also built drum sets under the name Bateman Drum Company. Outside of music, he has worked as a carpenter, which he also enjoys because it entails woodworking.

However, after the conclusion of matches played on 15 and 16 March 2020, the Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) postponed all further matches until 31 March 2020 at the earliest due to the pandemic. The postponement was initially extended to 14 April 2020, with the tournament postponed indefinitely. At the end of May 2020, Nizamuddin Chowdhury, CEO of the BCB, said they were waiting on the government's advise on the resumption of cricket in the country. On 2 June 2020, the Cricket Committee of Dhaka Metropolis said that they had no issue in resuming the tournament. In July 2020, the BCB looked at the possibility of restarting the tournament in September 2020, playing all the matches at two local hubs.

Manufactured by Anton Schwarzkopf as the first transportable looping roller coaster, the ride was named Looping Star and first owned by German showmen Oscar Bruch and Fritz Kinzler. After its debut at the Cranger Kirmes in 1978, it operated on several fairs in Germany until it was sold to the State Fair of Texas in 1980. After the 1983 season it was relocated to Jolly Roger Amusement Park where it operated for the 1984 and 1985 seasons before being relocated again in 1986. At Frontier City the ride was renamed Silver Bullet and is currently the tallest roller coaster at the park and the one that has been operating there for the longest time.  Ride experience  After leaving the station, riders instantly start climbing the lift hill. The first drop curves towards the right before going through the loop, which is the only inversion on the ride. After the loop, riders go through a right over-banked turn before going down a small drop followed by a smaller left over-banked turn. After going through another small drop, the ride does a banked turn to the left before dropping once more and going through a right banked turn through a tunnel. After the tunnel, riders are stopped on the brake run and are then let back into the station. The train on Silver Bullet uses a single lap bar to hold riders in the seat. This design works because the forces from the loop and helices press riders in their seats, and are a common feature with Schwarzkopf looping coasters. In 2017 seat belts were installed in addition to the lap bars.

(ENYF) is a community organization created to address food justice issues in the East New York neighborhood of Brooklyn, New York.  History  Following the disinvestment and neglect of the neighborhood in the 1960s and 1970s, the Pratt Center for Community Development and local organizations collaborated in 1995 to identify needs of the neighborhood including: more safe green spaces, income generating opportunities, retail, and better opportunities for youth. East New York Farms! was established in 1998 and became a program of United Community Centers (UCC) in 2007.  Urban agriculture  East New York Farms! consists of a network of two urban farms, UCC Youth Farm and the Pink Houses Community Farm, and a community garden, Fresh Farm, to grow produce for the farmers market. A majority of the families in East New York are Black and Hispanic with approximately 35% being immigrants, many of whom have agricultural backgrounds. The agricultural spaces grow a variety of crops from the farmers' and gardeners' cultural heritages, including the West Indies, West Africa, and Asia. The diversity of crops make the farmers market rare in the Northeastern United States. The farms regularly host workshops, tours and cooking demonstrations. = UCC Youth Farm = The UCC Youth Farm was established in 2010 and is located on one acre at Kingston and Winthrup Avenues on property owned by the High School for Public Service in East New York. It is managed by 35 youth ages 13-15 from East New York who are selected for 9-month paid internships at the farm. The program is intended to teach participants how to run an organic farm, and how to provide support to other gardeners. By using food and food justice as the catalyst, participants also learn about the environment, health & nutrition, entrepreneurship, and leadership. In 2012, the farm worked with the NYC Department of Education to establish soil safety standards. In 2016, the farm partnered with the Farm School NYC to offer the Farm Intensive Certificate program, a 7 month urban farm training. = Pink Houses Community Farm = The Pink Houses Community Farm is located at the Pink Houses, a public housing development owned by the New York City Housing Authority. The half-acre farm opened in 2015 as a partnership between Pink Houses Resident Green Committee and ENYF. Produce is distributed to residents of the development weekly in the community center.\\\\  See also  *Community gardens in New York City * Community gardening in the United States  References   External links  * East New York Farms *The Youth Farm Category:Community gardening in New York (state) Category:East New York, Brooklyn ","title":"East New York Farms"},{"id":"61814469","text":"Vanderstuyft is a surname.

It was the site of a major iron ore mining operation in the 1960s and 1970s. Location Lac Jeannine is in the unorganized territory of Rivière- Mouchalagane, Caniapiscau, Quebec. It is just east of Quebec Route 389. Lac Jeannine is from Gagnon, which was closed in 1985 and is now a ghost town. The lake is long and wide. A watercourse drains the lake through the mine dumps and a series of small lakes before running into the Manicouagan Reservoir. The lake's name seems to have been given by a prospector for the Québec Cartier Mining Company who was part of the team that discovered the rich deposit of iron ore in 1957. Mining operation The mining operation has its origin on 26 January 1957 when the Québec Cartier Mining Company was created by U.S. Steel to supply iron ore concentrate. The mine, the town to support 4,000 people, the Hart-Jaune power station and the railway linking the mine to Port- Cartier were built between 1958 and 1961. The cost was $325 million. The first load of iron ore concentrate was shipped in June 1961. From then until 1976 the mine employed more than 1,000 workers. The ore processing plant at Lac Jeannine had 12 identical processing lines. The first stage was autogenous grinding, and then the ore was separated using a gravimetric circuit with spiral classifiers. The ore from the circuit was filtered, and then shipped by rail to Port-Cartier. The deposit was long, wide and deep. It yielded over 266 million tons with an average concentration of 33%. The iron mine was in production from 1961 to 1976. The company made further investments in the 1970s at Mont-Wright, Fermont and Fire Lake, but during a steel market crisis was forced to shut down Lac-Jeannine. The mill at Lac Jeannine continued to treat iron ore from Fire Lake until 1985. That year the mill and the town of Gagnon were closed. The accessible part of the tailings, about 127 million tons in a sub-aerial pile, cover about . They are just under 10% iron. Another 26 million tons were deposited in the open pit mine, which has since flooded. In February 2007 it was announced that Quinto Mining of British Columbia had acquired an option of the iron tailings at the former mine.

Keo, who was raised by her grandmother, in a small town outside New York City, started working as an exotic dancer when she was just sixteen or seventeen years old. In 2007 Keo became friends with Samantha Barbash, someone who had been working in the club scene longer than her. Through her friendship with Barbash, Keo was able to boost her income. It was explained that women who worked together made more money. A high-roller being entertained by just one woman found it easier to keep his spending within limits. However, when two or more beautiful women were paying attention to him, it was easier to distract him. And, through being able to distract him, they could get him to authorize more credit card payments without keeping track of his spending. Many of Keo and Barbash's regular big-spending clients worked on Wall Street, and the 2008 financial crisis curbed their spending. Keo was away from the club scene, for several years, after giving birth to a daughter. When she returned to working the club scene, in 2012, she found that her friend Barbash was making more money than ever, while the clubs and dancers weren't. Barbash was using a ploy, where she would contact one of her old clients, and arrange to meet him for an ordinary date. When the target had enough female attention, and alcohol, to be suggestible, several beautiful confederates would show up, and cajole him to taking them to a strip club. On several occasions they drugged the men surreptitiously with MDMA. Several New York City strip clubs had arrangements with Barbash's team to pay a kickback from the target's credit card charges, at the club. Barbash and her team would guide the target into a private room, and then proceed to make sure he spent heavily. Law enforcement started tracking their activities in September 2014, and, in December 2014, Keo, Barbash, and three other individuals were arrested. Law enforcement officials could document that, during the investigation, they tricked or cajoled four men into spending $200,000. Keo and Barbash pled guilty, and were given five years of probation. They were allowed to keep all the money. In 2015 Jessica Pressler interviewed Keo and Barbash for an article in New York magazine. The expose earned Pressler a National Magazine Award nomination. A team of producers that included Will Ferrell \\"snapped up\\" the film rights in February, 2016. The story was adapted into a 2019 film by Gloria Sanchez Productions titled Hustlers, with Constance Wu playing the character based on Keo. Keo has scheduled her memoir, The Sophisticated Hustler, to be published in late 2019. Keo, like her former colleague Barbash, claims aspects of the film the inspired are inaccurate. Keo claimed that she and Barbash were essentially equal partners, saying Barbash was the CEO, while she was the CFO.

It is rarely opportunistic and generally manifests as a minor subcutaneous infection. History and taxonomy Cephalotheca foveolata was first discovered in 2006 in a subcutaneous infection of the foot in South Korea. The fungus was said to be \\"foveolate\\" because of its small pitted ascospores. The fungus has also been called Cephalotheca faveolata by Giridharan, Verekar, Khanna, Mishra, Deshmukh in 2012. C. foveolata is morphologically and molecularly very similar to other pathogenic species of fungus, especially those within the genera of Phialemonium and Acremonium. The D1/D2 variable domains of 28S rDNA have often been used to identify C. foveolata. This is necessary to distinguish C. foveolata from Cephalotheca sulfurea which has 95% homology or Phialemonium obovatum, another closely related species. Habitat and ecology C. foveolata has been discovered rarely but in areas around the world that differ greatly from each other. Most cases have been reported in the southern United States or southeast Asia (South Korea, Singapore, and Hong Kong). As a saprophyte, C. foveolata generally makes its home in the soil, but can also be found growing on wood or mushrooms. An exact niche for this fungus has yet to be detailed. Growth and morphology C. foveolata displays both teleomorph and anamorph stages in vitro as well as in its natural habitat, it is one of very few Ascomycetes that is able to do so. It also produces thick walled chlamydospores with a 3-6 μm diameter. In vitro the C. foveolata is black, brown, white, orange even yellowish sometimes. The colonies reach a 45-50 mm diameter in vitro on OA or PDA media in 14 days at 25 °C. Its maximum growth temperature is 39 °C though 25 °C is optimal. When grown on PFA medium C. foveolata produces a reddish brown diffusing pigment. Conidiogenesis occurs in vitro. These conidiogenous cells remain undifferentiated from hyphae and are monophialidic with ellipsoidal conidia at the end of short conidiophores. The conidia are translucent, cylindrical, 4-5x1.5-2 μm, and are said to be very similar to the conidia of Phialemonium. The cleistothecia fruiting bodies are dark and ciliated with a peridium made of elongated, thick walled cells. The pitted ascospores for which C. foveolata gets its name are generally kidney shaped, 4-5x3-4x2.5-3 μm, and hyaline to brown. The sexual spores are found in translucent brown 8 celled asci. Mechanism of pathology C. foveolata has been described as an opportunistic human pathogen and it is potentially consumed as a contaminant on food. After the first reported case in South Korea there have been 6 other cases as of 2011. Cases have included subcutaneous infections, infections of eyes, nails, lymph nodes, cardiac tissue, bronchial fluid, and one case of bloodstream infection. Symptoms were minor for all cases except in the case of the bloodstream infection where the patient had fevers, upper back pain and shortness of breath. Patients with subcutaneous infections had chronic granulomatous inflammation around infection; otherwise, urinalysis, liver/renal function tests, stool examinations, blood counts and smears all return results within normal limits. Treatment When C. foveolata was first discovered in South Korea a surgical removal was performed. The patient was followed for a year afterwards and it seemed the surgery was successful. Since then many anti-fungal drugs have been tried against C. foveolata. The most effective drugs so far have been amphotericin B, posaconazole and voriconazole. They inhibit all growth after 48 hours at 35°C. Caspofungin causes abnormal growth after 24 hours and is not considered effective. Itraconazole is reported with conflicting levels of effectiveness. C. foveolata seems to be resistant to AMB, itraconazole, and terbinafine. Medicinal uses C. foveolata produces a metabolite called sclerotiorin. Sclerotiorin has been shown to induce apoptosis in colon cancer cells by activating a pathway leading to caspase-3 activation.

The ship is armed with light defensive weapons in form of a Bofors 40 mm gun and two 12.7 mm heavy machine guns. The vessel could also carry four LCVP boats, and is equipped with a crane for cargo loading and offloading. Service history Teluk Bintuni was built by Indonesian shipbuilder PT Daya Radar Utama (DRU), using steel sourced from Krakatau Steel for its hull. The ship was ordered from DRU as part of a three-ship order for LSTs (where DRU was awarded just one), and DRU was the first builder to deliver the ship. At the time of its launch, it was the largest LST operated by the Indonesian Navy, with other vessels displacing 1,500 or 1,800 tonnes.

Barth, 1832. Phye (Φύη, Phýē) was a young woman from ancient Paeania who accompanied the tyrant Peisistratos in a chariot during his return to Athens in 546/5 BCE. Phye was dressed as the goddess Athena in order to deceive the people of Athens into believing that Peisistratos' return to Athens was divinely sanctioned.  Historical Context  Around 555 BCE, the tyrant Peisistratos was exiled from the city of Athens. During this exile, he formed an alliance with Megakles, and together they devised a plan to reinstate Peisistratos as tyrant of Athens. In 546/5 BCE, Peisistratos recruited Phye, a beautiful young woman from either the ancient deme of Paeania (modern Liópesi, south of Mt. Hymmetos) or that of Kollytos, to accompany him as he proceeded from Brauron to Mount Hymettos, through Marathon, and finally to Athens where they entered via the eastern gate of the city. The chariot in which Phye stood was preceded by heralds who announced that Athena was bringing Peisistratos back to Athens. Seltman paints a vivid - although not historically supported - image of their arrival, complete with the invention that the party (which was expected by the Megakles) arrived later than the appointed hour, and he suggests that Peisistratos was hailed as a \\"New Erechtheus\\", a reincarnation of the legendary king and founder of Athens. Lavelle claims that Megakles himself was the architect of this scheme and the mastermind behind the entire hoax. The name Phye itself derives from the noun φυή (from the verb φύω), which can be translated variously as good growth or stature, or the flower or prime of age; it is fitting that a tall, beautiful, young woman should be named thus.  Sources  = Herodotus = The earliest version of the story of Phye is found in Herodotus' Histories (1.60.4-5), which date to the 440s BCE. In the passages of relevance, Herodotus described Phye as nearly 6 feet tall and beautiful (εὐειδής), decked out in full armour and everything else needed to impress and convince the people of Athens. According to Herodotus, heralds arrived in the city prior to Peisistratos and Phye, announcing that Athena honoured Peisistratos above all other men and was escorting him back to her Acropolis personally. In his account, the Athenians are duped by this trick, and they both welcome Peisistratos back to the city and worship the human Phye as a goddess. Before telling the story, Herodotus inserts his own opinions of the event, specifically his astonishment that the Athenians - the most clever of all the Greeks - should be fooled by such a silly plan (Herodotus 1.60.3). The translations of Phye's situation in the chariot differ, and present a range of imagery. For example, Ferrari translates \\"...and placed her in a chariot in a pose that would make the best display\\", whereas Godley's text reads \\"and put in a chariot, giving her all the paraphernalia to make the most impressive spectacle\\". Whether the convincing accoutrements are objects or a gesture are unclear from the Greek word (σχῆμα). = Aristotle = The story of Phye is also found in Aristotle's Athenian Constitution (14.4), written sometime in the 3rd quarter of the 4th century BCE. Aristotle's version echoes many of Herodotus' details, including: that the Phye/Athena plan had been devised in conjunction with Megakles, that she was tall and beautiful, that rumours circulated saying that Peisistratos would be reinstated by the goddess herself, and that she accompanied Peisistratos into the city and was received amid cheers. Aristotle differs in one point from Herodotus, claiming instead that Phye was a Thracian from the deme of Kollytus rather than from Paeania. = Klei(to)demos = A version of the Phye narrative by the 4th century BCE historian Klei(to)demos is preserved in the 2nd century CE work Deipnosophists by Athenaeus. Klei(to)demos provides more details about Phye herself, beyond her physical beauty and striking similarity to the goddess Athena. Klei(to)demos credits Phye with restoring the Peisistratean tyranny, and then adds that she was a flower-seller, the daughter of a man named Sokrates, and that Peisistratos gave Phye to his son Hipparchos in marriage. This source provides the sole evidence that Phye was Peistratus' daughter-in-law. Rhodes suggests that the addition of her father's name indicates that Phye was, in fact, a citizen of Athens.  Credibility  The ancient authors present the story of Phye as a historical event, and Herodotus himself seems to have believed it. Scholars including Grote, Curtius, Busolt, and Connor accept the veracity of the narrative, whereas Stein, Beloch, and later Meyer instead believe the story was a ‘poetic variation of the historic tradition of the victory at Pallene’ (Herodotus 1.62.3ff); these latter scholars believe that it evolved from a historical victory at the temple of Athena at Pallene that transformed within two generations into a legendary story involving Phye. Against this theory, How and Wells argue that it takes \\"...almost greater credulity to suppose that history and myth could become thus inextricably mixed in the course of two generations than to accept the story of Phya\\". Lavelle, echoing Block, accepts the authenticity of the Phye incident based on its unique nature, Herodotus' accounts, and the plausibility of the story itself; the same author stresses that the Athenians did not believe that Phye actually was Athena, but that they accepted what she ('Athena') and Peisistratos himself represented together for the city of Athens. The connection between Peisistratos, the citizens of Athens, and their patron goddess is strengthened in this episode.  Iconography  Amphora depicting Athena mounting chariot with Herakles and other gods, c. 520 BCE. Approximately 170 ancient Greek vases (and at least one relief sculpted on a marble base), dating from the 560s through the 480s BCE, boast imagery of Herakles and Athena in a chariot, a scene commonly described as representing the apotheosis of Herakles. Boardman originally argued that these scenes departed from typical Heraklean apotheosis scenes (with Herakles and Athena on foot) because of a conscious desire to evoke the story of Peisistratos and Phye. In later works, Boardman rephrased his interpretation of these scenes, and said that they served as a point of reference for the historical Phye episode: \\"...familiarity with such scenes would have guaranteed the ordinary Athenian's recognition of what was implied by the procession.\\" Ferrari, following Osborne and Connor, acknowledges the similarities between the iconography of Herakles/Peisistraots and Athena/Phye, but argues that it was Peisistratos who was intentionally evoking Herakles in his decision to appear with 'Athena' in a chariot upon entering the city. One vase in particular by the Priam Painter offers further evidence for the link between the iconography of Herakles & Athena and the historical event of Peisistratos & Phye. On a belly amphora currently in the Ashmolean Museum (Oxford 212), a typical scene of Herakles and Athena is accompanied by the inscription \\"Ηρακλἐους κὀρη (Herakleous Kore)\\". Boardman, like Beazley before him, reads this as 'Herakles' daughter' rather than Herakles' girl, and connects the mythological to the historical in that Phye (Athena) was the daughter (in law) of Peisistratos (Herakles). Ferrari believes these words are the beginning of a metrical hymn and connects the mythological scene and historical event to the larger theme of the Panathenaic festival.

Located in Western Australia, it is the artillery component of the 13th Brigade. History The 7th Field Battery has its origins in the Union Troop of Western Australian Mounted Volunteers which was formed on the 19th of July 1870. The unit subsequently acquired two 12 pounder field artillery pieces and on the 1st of July 1872 became the W.A. Troop of Volunteer Horse Artillery. With the commencement of the First World War volunteers from Western Australia’s artillery militia units were grouped together as the 8th Battery 3rd Field Artillery Brigade as part of the 1st Australian Division. Armed with 18 pounders the battery served at Gallipoli even though the terrain was not suitable for the guns. After the withdrawal from Gallipoli the battery, together with the 14th Field Battery another West Australian Battery, took part in actions on the Western Front. An interesting point is the last round of artillery fired at Gallipoli was from a gun belonging to the 8th Battery. In World War II, Western Australia provided a single battery composed mainly of militia volunteers, designated the 6th Battery, 2/3rd Field Regiment. The Battery was initially issued with, and trained on, 18 pounders. 6th Battery was transported to England where they were re-armed with the new 25 Pounder guns. The Battery was sent to the Middle East then participated in the Greece and Crete campaigns usually in support of fellow West Australians in the 2nd/11th Battalion. In 1942 the Battery returned to Australia then served in action throughout the South West Pacific. At the end of World War II the battery was disbanded, however in 1948, the militia volunteers P and Q Batteries of the 3rd Field Regiment were raised. In 1965, the two were renamed 7th and 8th Batteries. In 1975 the unit was reduced to a single field battery as the 7th Field Battery, 3rd Regiment. In 2003, the Battery consisted of a headquarters element, a command post, four 105mm M2A2 Howitzer detachments and was part of 13th Brigade. Following the reorganisation of the Australian Army Reserve's artillery units as part of Plan Beersheba , the battery is now armed with the F2 81mm mortar as its primary weapon platform. It retains a number of M2A2s for ceremonial duties firing blank cartridges.

Gibson began her career at Smith College as an instructor in 1932, publishing her first works on research conducted as an undergraduate student. Gibson was able to circumvent the many obstacles she faced due to the Great Depression and gender discrimination, by finding research opportunities that she could meld with her own interests. Gibson, with her husband James J. Gibson, created the Gibsonian ecological theory of development, which emphasized how important perception was because it allows humans to adapt to their environments. Perhaps her most well-known contribution to psychology was the \\"visual cliff,” which studied depth perception in both human and animal species, leading to a new understanding of perceptual development in infants. Gibson was elected to the National Academy of Sciences in 1971, the National Academy of Education in 1972, and to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1977. In 1992, she was awarded the National Medal of Science.  Early life  Eleanor (née Jack) Gibson was born on December 7th, 1910 in Peoria, Illinois.

American Psychologist, 58(12), 1090-1091. doi:10.1037/0003-066X.58.12.1090 = Family = Gibson met her husband, James Gibson, at the end of her junior year at Smith while attending a graduation garden party. James was an assistant professor, and the day after meeting James, Gibson changed her schedule to include James’ advanced experimental psychology course. They married in September 1932. Their first child, James J. Gibson, Junior, was born in 1940. Their second child, Jean Gibson, was born in 1943. Gibson decided to take a break from research for a few years in order to focus on her children and teaching. = Education = Gibson began attending Smith College at the age of sixteen with the intention of studying languages. She graduated in 1931 with a B.A. degree. While at Smith, she became interested in experimental psychology.Eppler, M. (2006). Eleanor Jack Gibson: 1910-2002. The American Journal of Psychology, 119(1), 121-127. Gibson completed her master's degree at Smith, graduating in 1933. In 1935, Gibson began her Ph.D. at Yale University. While attending Yale, Gibson became interested in comparative psychology. Originally, Gibson had asked Robert Yerkes to be her dissertation advisor. He declined, stating that he does not permit women to work in his lab. Clark L. Hull, a behavioural psychologist, became her dissertation supervisor,American psychological foundation awards for 1986: Gold medal Awards. (1987). American Psychologist, 42(4), 327-332. Rodkey, E. N. (2011, July). The woman behind the visual cliff. Monitor on Psychology, 42(7). http://www.apa.org/monitor/2011/07-08/gibson despite the fact that they did not necessarily have the same theoretical perspective. Gibson completed her dissertation on differentiation using behaviourist terminology. After a year at Yale, Gibson passed the required exams and moved back to Northampton, Massachusetts, where she continued to teach at Smith. She completed her dissertation two years later in 1938, at which point she received her doctorate from Yale.  Academic career  Gibson began working at Smith College as an instructor in 1932. She took a year off in 1935 to pursue her Ph.D. at Yale University, before returning as an instructor at Smith College. In 1940, Gibson became an assistant professor at Smith. In 1941, James Gibson was requested to conduct perception research in the Flying Training Command of the United States Air Force at which point the family moved to Fort Worth, Texas. After a period of time, they moved to Santa Ana, California. After World War II ended, they moved back to Northampton, Massachusetts. Gibson resumed her position at Smith College in 1946. In 1949, James Gibson took a job at Cornell University, requiring that the family move to Ithaca, New York. Gibson was unable to obtain a job at Cornell due to anti- nepotism policies prohibiting her from working in the same department as her husband. Thus, Gibson became an unpaid research associate. She continued her research by reaching out to other Cornell faculty, working alongside Howard Liddell, a professor in Psychology. Gibson worked in Liddell's Behaviour Farm Laboratory, giving her experience working with and rearing baby animals.Szokolszky, A. (2003). An interview with Eleanor Gibson. Ecological Psychology, 15(4), 271-281. doi:10.1207/s15326969eco1504_2 Gibson's interest in development grew after working with the animals. Liddell's Behaviour Farm is where the discovery of the behaviour that led to the Visual Cliff took place. After conducting research there for two years, Gibson left the Behaviour Farm upon finding out that her control group of goats was given away. Later, Gibson received funding from the United States Air Force and grants from the United States Navy to work on perceptual learning. In order to further explore this topic, Gibson and her husband, James, co-authored a study on the perception of nonsense scribbles, eventually leading to the differentiation theory. Additionally, when Richard Walk was hired at Cornell University, Gibson and Walk decided to explore discrimination learning on rats who were raised in different environments, eventually leading to the Visual Cliff experiment. Their work together ended when Walk left Cornell University to pursue work at George Washington University. In 1966, James took a job elsewhere and was no longer employed by Cornell University. With anti-nepotism policies no longer an issue, Gibson became a professor at Cornell with tenure. After her academic partnership with Walk ended, Gibson was asked to join an interdisciplinary project with the goal of achieving a better understanding of the reading processes. In 1972, Gibson became the Susan Linn Sage Professor of Psychology and was given her own lab. At this point, Gibson turned her focus to perception in infants and turned her new lab into an infant perception lab. In 1979, Gibson was forced to retire from her faculty position, the same year that her husband, James, passed away. Prior to her retirement, she began visiting other universities, and continued to do so for many years afterwards. Gibson continued to work in her lab until 1987, at which point she moved to Middlebury, Vermont, to live closer to her daughter. =Zeitgeist (Spirit of the Times) = Eleanor Gibson lived through the period of the Great Depression and when gender discrimination was considered the norm. The time and social norms influenced her career. Gibson attended Smith College to complete her B.A. degree and M.S. degree. Smith College, at the time, provided Gibson the opportunity to be in an atmosphere that challenged and encouraged women to be scholars and scientists. Living through the Great Depression impacted her in a way where, due to financial issues and marriage, she could not begin her Ph.D. program until years later. She stayed as an instructor at Smith College for two years teaching labs before she set off to Yale University to obtain her Ph.D. In the spirit of the times, Yale University, unlike Smith College, did not support women's careers. Yale University did not provide financial assistance toward Gibson's post-secondary studies. Smith College awarded Gibson with a scholarship to continue her studies at Yale University, covering her tuition. Eleanor Gibson had strong interests in comparative psychology. Her interests led her to approach Robert Yerkes as her dissertation advisor. As gender discrimination was the norm, Yerks initially dismissed Gibson. Yerkes did not allow women to work in his laboratory. Gibson faced many gender barriers but sought alternatives to complete her goals. Gibson successfully completed her studies at Yale University, earning her Ph.D. in 1938. Gibson's academic career was disrupted due to the war and after the attack on Pearl Harbour in 1941. She accompanied her husband, James Gibson, to Texas and later California as he conducted research in the Flying Training Command of the Army Air Force. Eleanor Gibson continued her academic career at Smith College as a teacher after a 4-year hiatus. In 1949, Gibson and her husband left Smith College and moved to Cornell University. Cornell, at the time, did not hire women as part of their faculty. Cornell also had an anti-nepotism rule that did not allow her to work as a faculty member because her husband, James Gibson, had already been hired into their Psychology department. Gibson would work as a research associate for 16 years, unpaid. Gibson continued her research whilst facing gender discrimination and anti-nepotism rules.  Death  In Eleanor Gibson's final years she was focused on writing and publishing books. Her goal was to illustrate her progression of thinking. Her book titled, “An Odyssey in Learning and Perception”Gibson, E. J. (1991). Learning, development, and conceptual change. An odyssey in learning and perception. Cambridge, MA: The MIT Press. is a collection of her academic papers starting from the 1930s. The book encompasses her 50 years of work toward perceptual learning and development. In 2002, before her death, Gibson published a final book. Her final book was initially written as a personal family history but later evolved into a story about the lives of two psychologists. She titled her final book: “Perceiving the affordances: A portrait of two psychologists.”Gibson, E. J. (2002). Perceiving the affordances: A portrait of two psychologists. Mahwah, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates Gibson died on December 30, 2002, in Columbia, South Carolina.  Contributions to psychology  = Perceptual learning = Gibson was highly influenced by the work of her husband, James Gibson. Together they developed the Gibsonian ecological theory of development. This theory influenced her research on perceptual learning. Gibson believed that a radically different new view of perceptual learning was needed. One of her major studies involved the steps to how children perceive their environment.Benjafield, J. G. (2015). A History of Psychology (4th ed.). Don Mills, ON, Canada: Oxford University Press Gibson and her husband argued that the aspect of learning is to strengthen your insight or perception of the environment.Gibson, J. J., & Gibson, E. J. (1955). Perceptual learning: Differentiation or enrichment? Psychological Review, 62(1), 32-41. This process of perceptual learning was deemed a part of differentiation by Gibson and her husband. Humans first have the tendency to categorize everything that appears similar into groups. In other words, people tend to overgeneralize. With perceptual learning, humans can battle the tendency to overgeneralize by learning to make appropriate distinctions, such as the specific patterns and properties of different stimulus. An example Gibson and her husband used to describe this is that someone who regularly participates in wine tasting can taste the differences in many wines. However, someone participating for the very first time might think many if not all wines taste the same. Gibson worked with her husband James on a joint study to explore the perception of nonsense scribbles to clarify this concept of perceptual learning. The study consisted of three different groups. The first group had ten participants between 6 and 8 year olds. The second group had ten participants between 8½ to 11 year olds. The third group had twelve participants that were adults. The participants were tasked to identify one standard scribble from a set of similar scribbles varying in many different dimensions. The scribbles contained coils ranging from three to five and they were different in lengths. Some coils spiral clockwise while other coils spiral counter-clockwise. The experiment had a deck of cards with a different scribble on each card. Also included within the deck were various cards printed with other figures. The participants were given a target to look at for around 5s. They were informed that some of the cards had coils printed on them that are identical to the target. Next, each card was presented to the participant for about 3s. They were tasked in choosing the cards that were identical to the target. In the first trial, the deck of cards consist of 17 scribbles that were similar to the target and 12 other prints that were all very different from both the target and each other. Results showed that three groups learned to identify and differentiate items at various levels and various rates. In the first trial, the group with the youngest participants were able to identify most of the scribbles identical to the target, an average of 13.4. This was followed by the group with the older children who identified more than the third group, an average of 7.9. The group consisting of adults identified the least identical items, an average of 3.0. However, results also indicated that the group of adults were able to achieve perfect identification within an average of 3.1 trials, while the group of older kids achieved it within an average of 4.7 trials. On the contrary, many of the young children in the first group failed to match any correct coil to the target. The number of trials needed to achieve perfect identification could not be achieved within the duration of the study. At first the standard scribble was imperceptible from the other scribbles but after repeated tests the standard scribble became clear. The participants were tested until the standard was identified correctly without any correction given. The Gibson's then stated that the stimulus held all the information for perception rather than the participants learning to perceive through an associative process. This resulted in perceptual learning as being redefined as a change in what was perceived by an observer became more sensitive to the different aspects of a stimulus. At the beginning of the study, many of the stimuli or coil, appear to look identical. But with practice, the participants learn to tell the stimuli apart from one another. The process of perceptual learning occurs faster over time through repetition. Gibson states that differentiation is a crucial aspect to both evolutionary psychology and developmental psychology. Perceptual learning allow humans to respond differently yet appropriately to the stimuli in their environment. Gibson said that the links between the perceiver and their environment is the domain for where perceptual development occurs. She states that a person has only achieved perceptual learning of specificity if they can differentiate one object from another and if they can identify the properties of that object. Another study Gibson did in perceptual learning is the perception of words and spelling patterns. Learning to read is a crucial aspect in child development and is complicated as words can have different meanings when perceived by the reader. Gibson was interested in factors enabling a reader to reach the stage where they can instantly tell words apart. Gibson argues that pronounceability has an impact in reading as certain combinations of the alphabet are easier to pronounce than others. Certain letters pair well in certain positions in words which allows for easier perception. According to Gibson, these particular spelling patterns are pronounced the same. For example, the positions of the letters “glurck” is pronounceable despite it not being an English word. On the other hand, the positions of “ckurgl” is not as easy to pronounce. A person fluent in English may notice that the letters “gl” is the start of many words while “ck” is at the end of many words. Such spelling patterns in words allow a reader to easily perceive the words to pronounce.  Differentiation theory  Within her research on perceptual learning, Eleanor Gibson was particularly interested in, what she termed, the differentiation theory.Gibson, E. J. (1969). Principles of perceptual learning and development. New York: Appleton-Century-Crofts. The differentiation theory states that in the information received from sensory stimulation, individuals discriminate objects in the environment and experiences by identifying unique characteristics about them, termed distinctive features. Eleanor Gibson 1962 letter-like forms study - standard forms and transformations Eleanor Gibson performed a study to examine how young children discriminate between different “letter-like forms”.Gibson, E. J., Gibson, J. J., Pick, A. D., & Osser, H. (1962). A developmental study of the discrimination of letter-like forms. Journal of Comparative and Physiological Psychology, 55(6), 897-906. doi:10.1037/h0043190 The children used in the study were between ages 4 and 8 years old. The children were given 13 standard letter-like forms in a column on the left-hand side of the page to examine. Several variations in each letter-like form, termed transformations, were given along the rows. The transformations were either slight changes in appearance by altering the lines in the form (“topological transformation” and “line-to-curve transformation”) or a change in the perspective of the letter (“rotational-reversal transformation” and “perspective transformation”) while keeping the form identical. The task given to the children was to determine and indicate which transformations were no different from the standard forms. Overall, as age increased, the amount of incorrect differentiations made decreased. However, this varied depending on the level of difficulty of the transformations. The results demonstrated that the 4 to 5 year olds had great difficulties with all variations of the forms whereas the 6 to 8 year olds performed much better and were able to discriminate between the standard letter-like forms and the variations shown. The following list is ordered from the transformations that had the largest decrease in errors (largest improvement) to the smallest (least improvement), as age increased: rotational-reversal, line-to-curve, perspective, topological. These results contribute to the research on perceptual learning in that they suggest that children learn distinctive characteristics to be used for differentiation which is a large component of the identification of letters. = Visual cliff = Eleanor had been studying the development and process of imprinting in goats when the inspiration for the visual cliff was spontaneously discovered.Rodkey, N, E. (2015). The visual cliff’s forgotten menagerie: rats, goats, babies, and myth-making in the history of psychology. Journal of the History of the Behavioural Sciences, 51(2), 113-140. doi: 10.1002/jhbs.21712 While washing one of the baby goats, another was about to be born. Acting quickly, she placed the goat on an object elevated off the ground. The newborn did not move from where she placed it, giving some indication of depth perception.Visual cliff used with human infants At the time the visual cliff study had initially been designed, Gibson had been researching with a professor at Cornell, Richard Walk. Walk & Gibson were examining the development of rats and how this was influenced by their rearing environments. Walk & Gibson included dark-reared rats in their experiment, whose raising was extremely time-consuming. A combination of 1) wanting to get the most use out of the rats along with, 2) inspiration from both Eleanor's experience with the goats and a similar previous experiment done by Lashley & Russell in 1934,Lashley, K. S., Russel, J. T. (1934). The mechanism of vision. XI. A preliminary test of innate organization. Pedagogical Seminary and Journal of Genetic Psychology, 45, 136-144. produced the idea of studying depth perception with the visual cliff. Walk & Gibson studied visual depth perception in rats, chickens, turtles, lambs, baby goats, pigs, dogs, cats, and monkeys.Gibson, E. J., & Walk, R. D. (1960). The “visual cliff”. Scientific American, 202(4), 64-71. doi:10.1038/scientificamerican0460-64 In the original study with rats, the apparatus was made of two sheets of glass standing “parallel to the floor and 53 inches above it” with a thin board along the middle. The rats were either placed into the experimental group with the shallow and deep side or a control group having no deep side, only shallow. The results of the study demonstrated that the rats in the experimental group spent the majority of their time on the shallow side while the rats in the control condition did not show a preference. A follow-up study was then conducted with an apparatus having both deep sides with no shallow, along with the same control condition. The results of the follow-up study demonstrated that majority of the rats stayed on the center board and those that did not took longer to walk onto the glass than did rats in the control condition. Gibson then used a larger apparatus to test chickens, turtles, lambs, kids (baby goats), pigs, dogs, cats, and monkeys; all showing similar results. Walk & Gibson further experimented with dark- reared vs. light-reared rats to determine whether the depth perception found previously was innate. The results were similar. This indicated the possibility that depth perception was inherent in all animals. However, when tested with cats, this result was not found. This demonstrated the belief that depth perception is innate in some species while in others (such as cats), they must learn depth perception. Finally, Walk & Gibson examined visual depth perception in human infants with a larger apparatus. The infants ranged from 6 months old to 14 months old. Each child was placed on the center board with his or her mother standing on either the shallow side or the deep side, attempting to motivate the child to crawl toward the mother. The results demonstrated that the majority (approximately 90%) of the infants would crawl onto the shallow side but only approximately 10% would crawl onto the deep side. It was observed that the infants who refused to crawl onto the deep side would either crawl away from their mother when she was standing on that side or would cry. These results suggest that “the average human infant discriminates depth as soon as it can crawl.”  Legacy  = Accolades = Throughout Gibson's lifetime, she received the following awards. * APA Award for Distinguished Scientific Contributions to Psychology (1968) * The G. Stanley Hall Award for Distinguished Contribution to Developmental Psychology (1970) * Elected to the National Academy of Sciences (1971) * Elected to the National Academy of Education (1972) * Yale University's Wilbur Cross Medal (1973) * Elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences (1977) * Howard C. Warren Medal from the Society of Experimental Psychologists (1977) * The Distinguished Scientific Contribution Award from the Society for Research in Child Development (1981) * The American Psychological Foundation Gold Medal Award for Life Achievement in Science (1986) * The National Medal of Science (1992) * In addition, she received 11 honorary degrees, including degrees from Smith College in 1972 and Yale University in 1996. Just a couple years following her Visual Cliff Study, on behalf of the Chairman and Committee on Scientific Awards, George Armitage Miller, presented Gibson an APA Award for Distinguished Scientific Contributions.Eleanor Jack Gibson: Distinguished scientific contribution award. (1968). American Psychologist, 23(12), 861-863. doi:10.1037/h0020776 At the annual convention, she was recognized for her exceptional studies in perceptual learning and development. Along with James Birren and Muzafer Sherif, they were each presented with a writing of their contributions to the field of scientific psychology, as well as a cheque for one thousand dollars. This was the start of her acknowledgement. Following Gibson's retirement in 1979, she continued her involvement through research and faculty appointments at institutions across the world including the University of Minnesota, University of South Carolina, Indiana University, University of Connecticut, Emory University, and the University of Beijing. During the annual meeting of the APA in Washington, D.C., it was announced that Eleanor Gibson was the recipient of the Psychological Science Gold Medal Award. The Gold Medal Awards were given to American psychologists over the age of 65, whom resided in North America. Gibson was recognized for her distinguished and lifelong record of accomplishments in the areas of professional, scientific, and public interest, which ultimately landed her a golden medallion and a cheque for two thousand dollars. With her scientific findings, they continues to advance the knowledge of perception to this day. Gibson was among ten psychologists who received the National Medal of Science which was presented by the president, George H. W. Bush in 1992. After 30 years of establishment, the National Medal of Science had been awarded to 304 receivers where Gibson was one of the ten psychologists that received it. Gibson will be remembered for her Visual Cliff Study, which is currently being taught in undergraduate programs. = Commemoration = At the age of 92, Gibson died on December 30th, 2002. She was an experimental psychologist who significantly contributed to the many fields of psychology including perception, infant development, and reading.In appreciation: Eleanor Gibson. (2003, April). Observer, 16(4). https://www.psychologicalscience.org/observer In 1949, she worked as a researcher in the department of psychology at Cornell University. Gibson was then appointed professor in 1966, where she became the first woman to hold an endowed professorship at Cornell. Six years later, she was named the Susan Linn Sage Professor of Psychology. Gibson not only left an impact on the field of psychology but also an impact on the people she interacted with. Arlene Walker-Andrews, an associate provost and emeritus professor of psychology at the University of Montana, was one of Gibson's students at Cornell.Department of Psychology. (2015). http://hs.umt.edu/psychology/faculty/default.php?s=Walker-Andrews Gibson provided her with an opportunity to be a part of her research one month into the school year. Arlene was part of a team of graduate researchers, whom were all brand new students but Jackie never failed to give them full credit. Arlene viewed her as a \\"gifted mentor\\" and spoke on her generosity, flexibility, and willingness. She never undervalued the graduate students and always treated them like independent scholars. In appreciation of Gibson, Arlene noted that she was an outstanding model with her work ethic, determination, raw intellect, and dedication to the growth and development of students.  Published works  Eleanor Gibson published two major influential books, expanding the literature of learning in the psychological field. Her two books included: Principles of Perceptual Learning and Development and The Psychology of Reading.Gibson, E. J., & Levin, H. (1975). The psychology of reading. Cambridge, MA: MIT Press.

A graduate of the Balashov Aviation School, he flew a wide variety of aircraft, transporting mail and passengers as part of the civil air fleet during peacetime and flying military cargo missions during World War II. Early life Taymetov was born on 9 January 1909 to an impoverished Uzbek family. His mother died in 1911, and in 1914 his father died, after which he and his siblings lived with their cousin Baymet. In 1919 he entered a Soviet-run school while still attending a maktab in evenings. Having become a member of the Komsomol in 1922, he and his brothers participated in campaigns to eliminate illiteracy. While farms were being collectivized in 1927 and 1928 he became a village council secretary, since as a primary school graduate he was relatively educated at the time. In 1929 he studied agrochemistry in Tashkent for three months, after which he returned to his hometown of Chernak to work in pest reduction on the cotton farms. The next year he entered an industrial school in Tashkent, but while a student in summer 1932 he and 100 other Komsomol members at the school were mobilized and sent to the Tajik SSR to combat opposition movements. Prewar aviation career As a Komsomol member, he was admitted to an Osoaviahim glider school in 1932, where he would train in evenings after attending the industrial school during the day. In 1933 he was reprimanded and threatened with arrest for having practiced gliding instead of going to the factory, but was left off with a warning. Later that year he was admitted to the Balashov Aviation School, where out of over 2000 cadets he was the only Uzbek. Not being completely fluent in Russian, his second language, he struggled at times to understand the material, especially the names of all the aircraft parts, but after managing to get by theoretical training, he flew under the commander of flight instructor Konstantin Kartashov, a Russian who was born in Dzhambul and fluent in Uzbek. After graduating from the school he worked in the civil air fleet from 1935 to 1941. While stationed at an aeroclub as a flight instructor from 1936 to 1937 he trained some many new aviators, including the first Uzbek women parachutists. His future wife, Bibinis Baltabaeva, was one of those parachutists. In addition to training new pilots, he flew regional flights to the Kyrgyz, Tajik, Turkmen, and Kazakh SSRs, where he participated in the establishment of new airfields and mail routes. By 1940 he became well acquainted with a variety of aircraft types, including the U-2, P-5, PR-5, G-2, PS-9, Stal-3, Yak-12, and UT-2. World War II After the start of Operation Barbarossa he requested to be sent to the front, but was initially denied and retained as a flight instructor instead. From 1941 to 1942 he trained 71 pilots, after which he mastered piloting a new variant of the Li-2. In February 1944 he was sent to the front per his request, and assigned to the 10th Guards Aviation Division. That year flew 109 night missions delivering cargo to troops and partisans as well as reconnaissance. As pilot-in-command, his crew consisted of co-pilot Pyotr Gordienko, navigator Nikolai Smirnov, flight engineer Nikolai Dyomin, and radio operator Mikhail Malinkin. On 1 January 1945 he was reassigned to the 19th Special-Purpose Civil Aviation Regiment, in which he flew missions in Poland to provide assistance to partisans under Siarhei Prytytski. In addition to the Soviet Order of the Patriotic War and Order of the Red Banner he was awarded the Polish Virtuti Militari for his sorties. On 9 May 1945 he flew in the mission that delivered the German Instrument of Surrender and Victory Banner to Moscow. Postwar Once the war ended Taymetov returned to flying within the Civil Air Fleet, and became the commander of the 161st squadron before becoming the head of Tashkent Airport. At age 56 he graduated from the Law Faculty of Tashkent State University, after which he worked as the chief legal advisor to the Uzbek Civil Aviation Administration. He died on 8 July 1981 in Tashkent.

The Beneteau 323 was also marketed as the Beneteau Oceanis 323, as well as the Beneteau Oceanis Clipper 323 and a version was sold as the Moorings 32.2. The design was named Boat of the Year at the 2004 Oslo Boat Show. Production The design was built by Beneteau in France from 2003 until 2007, but it is now out of production. Design Beneteau 323 motoring The Beneteau 323 is a recreational keelboat, built predominantly of fibreglass. The hull is single skin polyester fiberglass, while the deck is a polyester fibreglass and balsa sandwich. It has a masthead sloop rig with a deck-stepped mast and aluminium spars, a nearly plumb stem, a rounded reverse transom with a walk-through swimming platform, an internally mounted spade-type rudder controlled by a wheel. Optionally it was built with a fixed fin (shoal draft) keel, deep draft keel or stub keel with a centreboard combination. The boat is fitted with an inboard diesel engine of .

It displaces and carries of cast iron ballast. Operational history Beneteau 323 In a 2010 review Heather Holm described the design, \\"the Beneteau 323 is a fast, responsive and comfortable coastal cruiser. With an LOA of 32’10” (10m) and LWL of 29’2″, she has “long legs” that can take you where you want to go. She can easily be sailed single-handed.\\" A boat US review by naval architect Jack Hornor, described the boat in 2014: \\"the sailing performance of the Beneteau 323 is a bit of a mixed blessing. By my calculations, sail area/displacement ratio is 19.6 and displacement/length ratio is 168. With these numbers it is not surprising that the 323 is an excellent light air performer. On the other hand, the ballast is only 26% of total displacement and even though the VCG (vertical center of gravity) is lowered with the modified-bulb keel, it not surprising that she is also reported to be a bit tender. Her broad beam and wide transom make it more important that she be sailed flat - like the big dinghy she resembles.\\" A 2015 review by Rupert Holmes in Boats.com, said, \\"In many ways the Beneteau Oceanis 323 set new standards for 32ft cruising yachts when it was first launched in 2004. A combination of higher freeboard, allied to a wide beam that’s carried well aft and a stepped coachroof produced a boat with significantly more volume than earlier designs of this size. At the same time, an efficient deep keel option was offered, which helped to make the boat one that could be expected to take offshore passages in its stride.\\" See also Beneteau 323 *List of sailing boat types Similar sailboats *Aloha 32 *Bayfield 30/32 *C&C; 32 *Columbia 32 *Contest 32 CS *Hunter 32 Vision *Hunter 326 *Mirage 32 *Morgan 32 *Ontario 32 *Nonsuch 324 *Ranger 32 *Watkins 32 References External links * Category:Sailing yachts Category:Keelboats Category:Sailboat types built by Beneteau Category:Sailboat type designs by Groupe Finot Category:2000s sailboat type designs ","title":"Beneteau 323"},{"id":"61815266","text":"Keith Leeson (7 December 1928 - 11 April 2012) was an Australian field hockey player.

The manor was detached from Egholm by Oluf Rosenkrantz in 1783 but the two estates had the same owners until 1806. The Gothic Revival style main building, the first on the estate, was built for Lars Trolle in 18. The estate covers 488 hectares of land. History =Rosenkrantz and Skeel families= Oluf Rosenkrantz Oluf Rosenkrantz inherited the manor of Egholm after his father. He later increased the number of copyholds under the manor dramatically. He had inherited Egholm after his father and over the years increased the number of copyholds to an extent that compromised the rational management of the estate. In 1647 he was granted royal permission to establish a new manor on part of the estate. The land had earlier belonged to the village of Vinderup which had been destroyed in the First and Second Dano- Swedish Wars. Oluf Rosenkrantz named his new estate Krabbesholm (Krabbe's Isle) as a tribute to his wife, Birgitte Krabbe. Frederik Christian Rosenkrantz Rosenkrantz fell out of favour at the court after opposing the new Absolute monarchy and was forced to cede all his estates to his daughters and sons-in-law. Egholm and Krabbesholm were ceded to Mogens Skeel. In 1685, Skeel sold theestates to Otte Skeel. After his death Krabbesholm passed to his son- on-law, Otto Krabbe. Otto Krabbe's and Birgitte Skeel's son in-law, Iver Rosenkrantz, inherited Krabbesholm in 1737. He was after his death in 1745 succeeded by his son Frederik Rosebnkrantz. Frederik Christian Rosenkrantz inherited the estates in 1763 and was already the owner of Ryegaard, Barritskov and Trudsholm. He endowed his estates to Niels Rosenkrantz with an obligation to establish a stamhus (family trust) from the estates. Stamhuset Rosenkrantz was established from Ryegaard, Barritskov and Trudsholm. =19th century= Nicolai Abraham Holten, owned Jrabbesholm in 1810-1850 In 1804, Niels Rosenkrantz sold Egholm and Krabbesholm to his brother Marcus Gjøe Rosenkrantz], who just two months later sold them to Christian Conrad, Count of Danneskiold-Samsøe and Lars Larsen. In 1806 the two partners divided the estates between them, leaving Danneskiold-Samsøe as the sole owner of Krabbesholm. The main building depicted by Ferdinand Richard In 1810, Krabbesholm was acquired by Nicolai Abraham Holten. Holten, who resided on his other estate, Lindegården, did not construct a main building on the estate. He established the first school in Sæby. Holten died in 1850. In 1852, Krabbesholm was sold in public auction. The buyer was Lars Trolle. In 1853, he constructed the first main building at Krabbesholm. In 1871, Trolle sold Krabbesholm to Frederik Vilhelm TTreschow. =20th century= Treschow 's daughter, Clara Sophie Treschow, who had inherited Krabbesholm in 1876, married Niels Joachim Christian Gregers Juel, a son of Niels Rudolph Juel of Hverringe Manor on Funen. He died in 1938. In 1939, Krabbesholm was sold in public auction for DKK 935,000. The biyer was De Forenede Kulimportører, a importer of coal, coke (fuel)coke and cinders.

It was focused originally on opposition to sex education. It has expanded to opposition to the Equal Rights Amendment, nondiscrimination policies, and same-sex marriage. The organization supports legal conversion therapy for minors and increased legal restriction on abortion. Family Foundation of Virginia is a Family Policy Council, meaning it is affiliated with Focus on the Family. An associated 501(c)(4) organization, Family Foundation Action, is used for political advertising, which the Family Foundation of Virginia's 501(c)(3) tax status prohibits it from. History = Founding by Walter Barbee = Family Foundation of Virginia was founded in 1985 by Walter Barbee. Barbee has stated that the roots of the organization go back to a county-level organization he formed in 1982, the Price William County Concerned Citizens Council, to oppose a sex education program for public schools. In 1988 Barbee was calling his organization Virginia Concerned Citizens Council. Barbee appeared together with Christian author Josh McDowell before the Virginia State Board of Education to argue against Family Life Education, a program that included sex education, and the \\"myth that teen- agers want to be sexually active.\\" In 1993 Family Foundation of Virginia advocated against a lesbian mother in a custody dispute, Bottoms v. Bottoms, asking for \\"child protection based on the mother's sexual behavior.\\" In this dispute, Virginia parent Sharon Bottoms was sued for custody of her son by the son's grandmother, Kay Bottoms, who viewed her daughter as an unfit parent because of her relationship with another woman. Upon learning that the judge, citing Virginia's sodomy law, had taken custody from Sharon Bottoms, Family Foundation spokeswoman Anne Kincaid commended the judge: \\"it took a lot of courage to draw this line.\\" = Formalizing by Victoria Cobb = Leadership of the organization passed to Victoria Cobb in 2004. A magazine profile of Cobb states that she \\"spearheaded a formalizing of the group's issue areas — officially they are life, marriage, parental authority, constitutional government and religious liberty\\". Family Foundation of Virginia strongly advocated for the 2006 Marshall-Newman Amendment, which added legal prohibition of same-sex marriage to the Constitution of Virginia. Executive director Cobb wrote in support that \\"most of us believe and understand that traditional marriage is a good thing and that kids need both a mom and a dad.\\" The organization placed phone calls to 2.1 million Virginia households in 2006, asking about gay marriage as a part of a political survey. Larry Sabato, a political scientist at the University of Virginia, called the survey \\"baloney,\\" believing it was instead an effort to drive voter turnout. The 2006 Amendment would be overturned by federal judge Arenda Wright Allen in 2014. Cobb reacted saying that the state \\"has no interest in affirming the love of its citizens, but it does have an interest in protecting children.\\" Cobb criticized a court's 2006 decision to dismiss a felony charge against a pregnant Virginia woman who had used cocaine to ease cramping during labor. She said her organization would investigate criminalizing drug use by pregnant women. Family Foundation of Virginia opposed a 2006 proposed LGBT employment anti-discrimination law; Cobb described the proposal as \\"another legislative attempt to force people to believe that homosexuality is as immutable as the color of a person's skin.\\" In 2007 the organization lobbied for legislation to end no-fault divorce for married couples with children. In 2012 Family Foundation of Virginia lobbied against the nomination of Tracy Thorne-Begland as a district judge, accusing him of \\"a violation of the military oath\\" because he had come out as gay while serving in the Navy during the Don't ask, don't tell policy era. Thorne-Begland's nomination was not confirmed. The gay rights group Equality Virginia issued a statement saying this was the result of pressure by the Family Foundation. = Blocking the ERA = In January of 2019 Virginia was poised to become the 38th state to ratify the Equal Rights Amendment (ERA), which would have caused the amendment to cross the constitutional threshold of the number of state ratifications required of amendments. Family Foundation of Virginia lobbied against the ERA. In an editorial, Victoria Cobb wrote that she was able to \\"lead an organization, earning the same pay as [her] male colleagues\\" without the ERA, \\"a vague amendment promising vague rights.\\" The 2019 ERA ratification in Virginia failed by one vote. The Washington Post called Cobb \\"the new Phyllis Schlafly\\" for her role in defeating the amendment. Delegate Margaret Ransone, who voted against the ERA, spoke at a press conference held by Family Foundation of Virginia; she noted that most of those who had worked to oppose the ERA were women. Virginia's legislature passed the ERA in 2020. Victoria Cobb said the amendment would \\"erase the entire notion of gender.\\" References Category:Lobbyists Category:Christian fundamentalism Category:Politics of Virginia Category:Opposition to sex education Category:Organizations that oppose same-sex marriage Category:Organizations established in 1985 Category:1985 establishments in Virginia ","title":"Family Foundation of Virginia"},{"id":"61815496","text":"The Dubai Stars is a walk of fame which will be located along the sidewalk of the Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Boulevard in Downtown Dubai.

History  In 1944, after the genocide and deportation of the Chechen and Ingush people and the Chechen-Ingush ASSR was abolished, the village of Shirdi-Mokhk was renamed to Pervomaysk, and settled by people from the neighboring republic of Dagestan. From 1944 to 1957, it was a part of the Vedensky District of the Dagestan ASSR. In 1958, after the Vaynakh people returned and the Chechen-Ingush ASSR was restored, the village regained its old Chechen name, Shirdi-Mokhk.  Population  * 1990 Census: 275 * 2002 Census: 0 * 2010 Census: 54 At the time of the 2002 Census, Shirdi-Mokhk had been abandoned due to the Chechen Wars, but by the 2010 Census, some of the population had returned.

According to the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), she is a high-ranking member of the Gulf Cartel, a criminal group based in Tamaulipas, Mexico. In the cartel, Ramos Rangel is known by her aliases Big Momma and ' (The Aunt). She has reportedly been responsible for coordinating international drug trafficking shipments from Mexico to the United States since the mid-1980s. Her role in organized crime is unusual, as a woman active in the male-dominated Mexican drug trafficking industry over several decades. Ramos Rangel is wanted in the U.S. states of Texas and Arkansas for her alleged involvement in drug trafficking. According to multiple federal indictments, Ramos Rangel has employed family members to distribute cocaine in the United States on her behalf. She has also employed inmates from U.S. federal facilities to help her distribute drugs after their release from prison. Investigators believe she is hiding in Matamoros, her hometown and center of operations. The FBI is offering a US$25,000 bounty to anyone providing information that leads to her arrest and conviction. Early life and career Idalia Ramos Rangel was born in Matamoros, Tamaulipas, Mexico, on 20 May 1955. She has naturally black hair and brown eyes and is of Hispanic descent. According to the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), Ramos Rangel has been responsible for coordinating international drug trafficking activities from Mexico to the United States since the mid-1980s. She is reportedly a high-ranking member of the Tamaulipas-based Gulf Cartel. She is a particularly unusual figure in organized crime circles, given her involvement over several decades in the male-dominated Mexican drug trafficking industry. In her FBI profile, Ramos Rangel is described as being between and tall, and weighing between and . Ramos Rangel has altered her physical appearance multiple times, by dying her hair blonde and through plastic surgery. The FBI suspects that her file pictures may be outdated, and that her appearance may have changed again. Among other personal details in her FBI profile, she is described as having been a business owner running multiple businesses in Mexico, including a sports bar in Matamoros. Investigators have stated that Ramos Rangel is a regular Facebook user, and that she travels to Monterrey, Nuevo León for pleasure. She is a breast cancer survivor. Ramos Rangel uses multiple identities and aliases, including Big Momma, (The Aunt), Soria Cano, Idalia Ramos Martinez, Idalia Martinez, Idalia Gonzales Perez, Idalia Ramos, Idelia Ramos Rangel, Idalia Rangel, and Idelia Ramos Ramos. Her current whereabouts are unknown, but investigators believe she may be hiding in Matamoros, her center of operations. The FBI is offering a $25,000 bounty for information leading to her arrest and conviction. She faces federal drug charges in the states of Texas and Arkansas, and has been a fugitive of United States justice since the 1980s. In the late 1990s, U.S. authorities searched a home in Brownsville, Texas during an anti-marijuana operation. The agents were investigating a Mexican drug trafficking ring smuggling marijuana through Mexico, South Texas, Houston, and other parts of the United States. Ramos Rangel was discovered living at the house. US$15,000 in cash was found in a trash can, with a list of apparent drug transactions. When questioned, Ramos Rangel refused to cooperate. She was arrested, not on drug charges but because she was in the country illegally. She had already served a prison sentence in the United States for a previous drug offense, and had been deported and ordered never to return to the country. Ramos Rangel was a low-level criminal during that time. In subsequent years, she rose through the leadership ranks of the Gulf Cartel. United States officials have issued extradition requests to the Mexican government since her ascent, but acknowledge the legal difficulties of the process. The FBI-led case against Ramos Rangel began in 2010. With the joint participation of the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), the FBI's case has yielded arrests in Arkansas, Brownsville and Austin. The operation was code-named Operation Dirty Bird. Indictments and network In April 2011, the Cameron County Sheriff's Office in Brownsville seized of cocaine heading to Chicago, Illinois. According to several witnesses who testified to law enforcement, the cocaine shipment was owned by Ramos Rangel. A Brownsville drug trafficker, Julio Cesar Cardenas, was involved in the scheme, helping a co-conspirator to move Ramos Rangel's drug load. Cardenas assisted by storing of the cocaine. After police seized the drugs, Cardenas advised the co-conspirator on how to deal with Ramos Rangel, recommending the use of violence, specifically kidnappings and bombs, to settle disputes with her gangsters. On 2 May 2013, Ramos Rangel was indicted by a federal grand jury in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Arkansas for several drug trafficking offenses, including possession of narcotics with intent to distribute them; cocaine trafficking; and using a telephone to coordinate drug trafficking activities. A federal warrant for her arrest was issued that day in Arkansas. The indictment was unsealed in court on 14 May. Under a superseding indictment charging other criminals associated with her, another federal arrest warrant was issued for Ramos Rangel in Arkansas on 6 June 2013 following the arrest of several of her alleged associates. The indictments stated that, on or around June 2008, Ramos Rangel and 15 of her associates (updated to 17 by a superseding indictment on 2 April 2014) knowingly possessed, with intent to distribute, at least of cocaine. Ramos Rangel's network was accused of distributing over of cocaine in Arkansas. Ramos Rangel was identified as the lead conspirator and was accused of employing her children and other relatives to facilitate the drug scheme. Ramos Rangel reportedly coordinated with her son, Mohammed Kazam Martinez (\\"Mo\\"), who was imprisoned at the Federal Correctional Institution in Forrest City, Arkansas, to recruit inmates to assist in distributing cocaine for her network upon their release from prison. When Ramos Rangel's network used this hiring method it was a relatively new tactic for Mexican drug cartels. Inmates close to finishing their sentences are employed in order to work for the cartel on their release. These inmates are not directly part of the cartel's hierarchy, and are generally regarded as \\"work-for-hire\\" members. Among those inmates were Emmanuel Ilo (\\"Chi\\") and Mervin Johnson (\\"Slim\\"), who distributed cocaine for her in central Arkansas after they were released. Ramos Rangel's son used the prison's telephone system and emails to communicate with other members of her network. In one recorded telephone conversation with Johnson, quoted in Ramos Rangel's indictment, Martinez mentions his mother's role in the conspiracy while discussing a drug debt, saying: \\"You owe Big Momma some money. If you keep f***ing up, they gonna cut everybody off. You are gonna f**k [Ilo] and me up because of you.\\" Other members of Ramos Rangel's network included her son Homar Martinez, Manuel Garza (\\"Manny\\"), Jaime Benavides, her daughter Nishme Martinez (\\"La Gorda\\"), Denice Duran Martinez, Yadira Anahy Martinez, Leobarda Jaime Ugalde (\\"Leo\\") and Juan Alonso Morales. They helped Ramos Rangel by securing cocaine deliveries from Mexico and Texas to Little Rock, collecting cash proceeds, creating bank accounts and depositing/withdrawing money, liaising with other drug dealers in Mexico and the United States, and smuggling cash earnings back into Mexico. Ramos Rangel used local redistributors, who sold the cocaine in Arkansas. Through Ilo, her network worked with local dealers, including Dwatney Noid, Dwight McLittle (\\"D.A.\\"), Lamont Williams (\\"Peter Rabbit\\"), Gerard Trice (\\"Fly\\"), Tarvars Honorable (\\"Pudgy\\"), and Shanieka Tatum, who distributed directly to buyers. All of Ramos Rangel's associates deliberately concealed the nature of their activities, and used coded language and countersurveillance to avoid law enforcement detection. Authorities described the case against Ramos Rangel as atypical, as it involved an international criminal group, coordination among federal inmates, and the supply of a large quantity of cocaine to Arkansas. The value of the cocaine trafficked to Arkansas by Ramos Rangel's network is estimated at US$10 million. If Ramos Rangel is found guilty of the conspiracy charge, she faces a mandatory minimum 10-year sentence, up to life imprisonment, with up to US$10 million in fines, and five years of mandatory supervised release. If found guilty of possession with intent to distribute less than of cocaine, the maximum sentence would be 20 years, a US$1 million fine, and three years of supervised release. The charge of using a communication device to facilitate drug trafficking activities carries a maximum four-year sentence, US$250,000 in fines, and up to a year of supervised release. She is considered innocent until proven guilty of the drug offenses through due process.

It was the headquarters of Cheshire County Council and is now the Riverside campus of the University of Chester. History Originally Cheshire County Council held their meetings at the Crewe Arms Hotel conveniently located near to Crewe station in Crewe. After deciding that this arrangement was inadequate for their needs in the context of the increasing responsibilities of county councils, county leaders chose to procure a new county headquarters: the site selected, which was immediately to the south east of the old shire hall on the north bank of the River Dee, had previously been occupied by a late 18th century prison which had been designed by Thomas Harrison but had been demolished in 1902. Construction started on the new building, which was designed by E. Mainwaring Parkes, the County Architect, in the Neo-Georgian style, in 1938 but there were delays because of the Second World War and the new county hall was only officially opened by Queen Elizabeth II on 11 July 1957. The design involved a symmetrical main frontage with seventeen bays facing onto Castle Drive with the end bays projecting forwards; the central section featured a portico on the ground floor containing a doorway flanked by columns; there was a window on the first floor and another on the second floor again flanked by columns which supported an entablature with two finials above. Internally, the principal room was the council chamber. Pevsner's verdict was that the building was \\"not an ornament to the riverside view\\". Following the abolition of the County Council in March 2009, the new unitary authority, Cheshire West and Chester Council chose to occupy a modern building on the site of a former police headquarters and overlooking the Chester Racecourse. County Hall became surplus to requirements and was sold to the University of Chester for £10.3 million. It was then converted for educational use as the University's Riverside Campus so that it could accommodate the university's Faculties of Health and Social Care and Education and Children's Services. The council chamber was converted into a large lecture theatre.

He took up legal practises in Sherborne and Dorchester, rose to the office Lieutenant in the local Dorset Militia, and served several minor governmental offices in his home county of Dorset. Boswell also published two antiquarian works on the history of Dorset, and a detailed map of the county. Career Edward Boswell was born on 5 April 1760, in Piddletown, Dorset, where his family had lived for \\"centuries past\\", according to his obituary. In 1780, he was made an apprentice of the solicitor and Clerk of the Peace, John Waller of Dorchester, who he continued to work with until Waller's death in 1792. After this, Boswell moved to Sherborne, where he took up his own practise. Here, in 1793, Boswell was appointed Clerk to the Lieutenancy of Dorset, an office he continued to hold until his death. The following year, he entered the Dorset Regiment of Militia, became an Ensign, and joined the headquarters at Henley-on-Thames. He traveled with this regiment to several locations, including Brighton and Oxford, and attained the rank of Lieutenant. In 1795, he resigned from this position, and returned to Dorchester, where he founded another practise, serving as an attorney. In 1800, Henry Fox- Strangways, 2nd Earl of Ilchester, a close friend of Boswell's, made Boswell the steward of the royal manor and Liberty of Wyke Regis and Elwell, another office he held until his death. In 1802, he was appointed as the Deputy Receiver General of taxes in Dorset, by the Receiver General, William O'Brien, brother-in-law of the 2nd Earl of Ilchester. In a congratulatory letter to Boswell, O'Brien indicates he had been obligated to hire Boswell by his employer, but would have done so anyway, because of \\"the strong wishes of the Earl of Ilchester to be of service to you\\". Boswell occupied this office until O'Brien's death in 1811. In 1808, the magistrates of quarter sessions appointed Boswell and John Tregonwell King, the treasurers of Dorset, an office solely occupied by Boswell upon King's death in 1835. Antiquarian work In 1795, under the patronage of the Lord Lieutenant and magistrates of the county, Boswell published The Civil Division of the County of Dorset, concerning the civil administration of his home county. The book was revised and enlarged for the second edition of the work, published in 1833. His obituary spoke highly of the work, \\"whether as a book of reference, or as one of general in formation connected with the whole civil administration of the county, it is impossible to speak in too high terms of commendation; and the methodical and perfect arrangement of its details, and the quantity and variety of its contents, prove the persevering nature of his character, and the possession of no ordinary genius.\\" Two centuries later, in Boswell's biographical sketch for the Oxford Dictionary of National Biographer, historian Jonathan Harris referred to the work as the \\"standard account of the civil administration of the county\\". In 1826, Boswell published another work of local history, The Ecclesiastical Division of the Diocese of Bristol. This book comprised a history of the rise of Christianity in Dorset (especially under the Heptarchy), a catalogue of the particulars of the Diocese of Bristol, and a history of the Archdeaconry of Dorset. His obituary speaks as highly of this work, describing it as the product of the author's \\"great antiquarian, as well as local, knowledge\\". Boswell owned a large library, comprising mostly antiquarian, topographical, and historical works. In anxiety about Napoleon's planned invasion of the United Kingdom, Boswell also produced a map of his home county in 1804, which was later lithographed for private circulation. This map was produced mostly with reference to the government and resources of the county, containing: \\"the site of the beacons, and their communications with each other – the signal-posts erected by the Government— the depôts and places of assembly of the volunteer corps—the number of the inhabitants of the county comprising the volunteers actually serving—the number of persons capable of bearing arms, guides, conductors, &c.; and a general summary of the resources of the county as to the live and dead stock, the services to be per formed by individuals, supplies to be furnished, the number of mills and ovens, of boats and barges, &c.; the whole forming a most complete statistical account of the county in that year, compiled from the returns made under the Act for defence and security of the realm\\". Personal life and death In 1803, Boswell married Edith Feaver, daughter of the vicar of St Marychurch, Rev. John Feaver. Together, they had one daughter. In general, his \\"domestic relations of life [were described as] unexceptionable.\\" Boswell died in his home in Dorchester on 30 October 1842, and was buried in Holy Trinity Church, Dorchester five days later. His obituary memorialised his character favourably, recalling him as \\"a man possessing strong powers of mind and body, and a very retentive memory; he was a cordial lover of books and literature, and he read and digested the best works he could obtain on many subjects\\". \\"He was never idle, and was a man of most orderly and methodical habits, everything he took in hand being at once reduced to system\\".

History  Earliest plans of creating the circular railway surrounding the city of Łódź were dated with late 1880s, and were mostly made for freight purposes to connect textile factories. The earliest section to be actually built was done as part of Warsaw-Kalisz railway in 1900-1902 - it ran between Zgierz and Łódź Kaliska stations. One year later a southern section from Widzew to Kaliska station through Chojny was put into service. During World War I the track gauge was changed from into standard . In 1926 a railway from Widzew to Zgierz through Bałuty was built, though the station was built 2 years later and the section was put into service in 1931. During World War II Łódź was annexed by Germany into Reichsgau Wartheland and renamed into Litzmannstadt. In 1940-1941, extensively using the forced labourers from the ghetto, a marshalling yard in the area of Olechów was built, along with the tracks to Chojny and Widzew stations. In 1950s the first plans of electrifying the railways in Łódź were brought up. In 1951 a station was opened in Żabieniec, and in 1958 the sections from Kaliska to Widzew stations, along with connectors from Chojny and Olechów stations, were electrified. In 1965 the section from Łódź Kaliska to Zgierz was electrified, and 4 years later electrification was done on Zgierz-Widzew section. New stops were opened in 1970s: in Stoki and Arturówek neighbourhoods, and new platforms of Łódź Żabieniec station were made. The former were closed down in late 1980s and early 1990s. At the same time some platforms within the area of Olechów freight station were excluded from passenger service. In 2010 ŁKA company was established, and subsequently a plan to create a commuter service on the circular line was brought up. First new stopping points: Radogoszcz Zachód, Pabianicka and Dąbrowa, were opened in 2013. One year later a new platform was opened in Marysin neighbourhood, in a close proximity of defunct Radegast station, which was turned into a memorial site, as well as new platforms in Stoki and Arturówek were built. In 2019 the stopping points near Olechów freight station were refurbished and brought into service, while a construction of new stopping points: Warszawska and Radogoszcz Wschód, as well as reconstruction of Marysin station has begun.

Plans for a dedicated service for railway ring line ŁKA-0 are expected to materialise after completion of western cross-city tunnel between Kaliska and Fabryczna stations.

The section from Zgierz to Łódź is a crucial part of a railway ring around the city. The railway line was opened in 1902 as the part of broad gauge Warsaw-Kalisz railway. During World War I it was rebuilt into standard gauge. Electrification of the line took place in 1965. In the years 2007 the railway line was closed down due to poor condition of the tracks. Refurbishment took place between March and September 2011. Traffic was restored on 1 October 2011. In the year 2013 the line received new stopping points, due to creation of Łódź Commuter Railway. Since 2015 ŁKA serves passenger traffic on the entire length of railway line. Previous operator, PolRegio, only serves a section between Zgierz and Łódź Kaliska stations.

The Chetnik forces of 2,500 captured Višegrad, destroyed big railway bridge across river Drina and continued their advances toward Rogatica and Sokolac. The Chetnik forces included members of the British and American missions who participated in the battle and destruction of the bridge. The German and Ustaše garrison in Višegrad and garrison that protected the bridge of total 1,100 soldiers had 350 dead and 400 wounded. The Chetniks had 21 dead and 30 wounded. In subsequent battle for Rogatica waged ten days later, the Chetniks captured Rogatica and killed more than 200 Axis soldiers. This Chetniks' victories against Axis were attributed by BBC to Tito's Communist Partisan forces, like in many other cases in that period of the war. Despite many protests, the BBC did not make any corrections. When Chetniks attacked Sokolac on 21 October 1943, the Partisans attacked them from rear and Chetniks found themselves under attack of Axis and Communist forces which ended advances of Chetniks into Eastern Bosnia and toward Sarajevo. This was emphasized by Chetnik commander Mihailović as another proof that Communists collaborated with Ustaše and Germans.  Forces  The Battle for Višegrad was part of a Chetnik anti-Axis offensive in Eastern Bosnia. The Chetnik headquarters were in Višegrad and Dobrun during this offensive.:\\"During the Cetnik offensive in East Bosnia in October 1943, the High Command was in the area of Visegrad and Dobrun\\" The Chetniks mobilized 15-18,000 soldiers in four corps (Romanija, Cer-Majevica, Mačva and Avala Corps). The offensive, also called the Third Chetnik Uprising, was commanded by Zaharije Ostojić while Chetniks from Western Serbia were under command of Dragoslav Račić.:\\"Акци]ом ]е руководио Захари]е Осто]ић, а командант снага ко]е су кренуле из западне Срби]е био ]е Драгослав Рачић. Напад четника ]е извршен на Вишеград.\\" The Chetniks were accompanied by members of British mission headed by Brigadier Charles Armstrong who arrived to Chetnik headquarters at the end of September 1943, and by the ranking American officer attached to the British mission, Lieutenant Colonel Albert Seitz. One of the aims of Chetnik attack on Višegrad was destruction of a railway bridge over River Drina, as instructed by Brigadier Armstrong. Less than a week after Armstrong arrived at Chetnik headquarters he and Seitz and Hudson saw a successful Chetnik attack on Višegrad and destruction of the railway bridge across Drina. Armstrong and Seitz took part in a Chetnik action against Axis- controlled units protecting the railway bridge over Drina near Višegrad.:\\"Demolished Railway Bridge near Visegrad in Bosnia. Col. Albert Seitz, the chief of American Mission and General Charles Armstrong, the chief of British Mission SOE took part in the action.\\" The German garrison in Višegrad had more than 800 soldiers while another garrison of 300 German soldiers was protecting main bridge over the River Drina. The Chetnik force of 2,500 soldiers that attacked Višegrad used heavy mortars, light artillery and small arms.  Attack on Višegrad  According to the plan of attack, developed by Zaharije Ostojić, the attack on Višegrad was organized from both left and right bank of river Drina. The attack from the left bank was planned to start one hour earlier than attack from the right bank, with intention to provoke German forces to leave bunkers on the right side to support their forces on the left side of the river. The attack started in 4 am on 5 October 1943. Before Chetniks stormed into Višegrad they first destroyed four smaller bridges in Mokra Gora. The Chetnik forces began with preparation movement for this battle during the night of 2 October 1943. Two days later Chetniks attacked Axis troops garrisoned in Višegrad . There was a fierce fighting between German and Ustaše garrison and Chetniks. The bridge was taken by assault of Chetniks who used only hand grenades. The casualties of Chetniks were 21 dead and 30 wounded. At the beginning of October 1943, based on Armstrong's instructions Mihailović and his Chetniks organized the attack on Višegrad, captured the town and destroyed the railway bridge across river Drina on Sarajevo-Užice railway. This bridge was the longest bridge in Axis occupied Yugoslavia destroyed by rebel guerrilla. In this attack about 2,500 Chetniks killed about 350 Ustaše and German soldiers and captured a lot of ammunition and arms. The Axis forces had 400 wounded. The bridge near Višegrad was destroyed with help of British sappers commanded by British Major Archie Jack.  Aftermath  The BBC credited communist forces of Yugoslav Partisans for the successful anti-Axis campaign of Chetniks in Višegrad. The BBC did not make any corrections although the people and institutions who protested because of this misinformation included Kenneth Pickthorn and officials of Yugoslav government in exile in London. After the capture of Višegrad, the Chetniks also captured Rogatica on 14 and 15 October and killed more than 200 Axis soldiers. The BBC again credited communist forces with this success.:\\"Once more, the Partisans were credited with the attack.\\" The Chetnik forces then advanced toward Sokolac, using arms captured from Germans and Ustaše who retreated together with many Muslim civilians who also suffered substantial casualties during Chetnik chase of Ustaše and German forces.:\\"Големе снаге Равногораца, са пуно камиона, бацача и топова отетих од Нщемаца и усташа надирале су у октобру 1943. од Рогатице ка Сокоцу, тjераjу!m Нщемце и усташе...\\" When Chetniks attacked Axis forces in Sokolac on 21 October 1943, the Partisans attacked them from rear. In his report Mihailović emphasized that this was the best proof that communists closely collaborated with Ustaše and Germans.:\\"Ово нека послужи као најбољи доказ свима да су комунисти у пуној сарадњи са усташама и Немцима\\"  References   Sources      ** Category:Battles of World War II involving Chetniks Category:Battles of World War II involving Germany Category:Yugoslavia in World War II Category:1943 in Serbia Category:1943 in Croatia Category:October 1943 events ","title":"Battle of Višegrad"},{"id":"61816256","text":"The Crewe Arms Hotel is a leisure facility in Nantwich Road, Crewe, Cheshire. It was for nearly 70 years the meeting place of Cheshire County Council. History The hotel was originally built as the station hotel for the Grand Junction Railway in 1837 and passed into the ownership of the London and North Western Railway on its formation in 1846. After Prince Albert acquired an interest in Balmoral Castle in 1848, Queen Victoria became a regular visitor to the Crewe Arms Hotel when she stayed overnight on her journey to her summer holidays in Scotland. An underground tunnel was built to enable her to move freely and in privacy to and from the station which was to the immediate west of the hotel. The hotel was substantially rebuilt in 1880 to a design which involved a symmetrical main frontage with eight bays facing onto Nantwich Road; the central section of two bays, which slightly projected forward, featured an entrance on the ground floor, two windows on each of the first floor and second floor and a large and distinctive entablature supporting the coat of arms of the Barons Crewe at roof level. Following the implementation of the Local Government Act 1888, which established county councils in every county, the hotel became a convenient meeting place for Cheshire County Council and it continued to host council meetings until County Hall on Castle Drive in Chester was completed in 1957. The hotel then came into the ownership of the London, Midland and Scottish Railway in 1922. Following nationalisation of the railways it became part of the portfolio of the British Transport Hotels in January 1948. It was acquired by Embassy Hotels in 1969 and, after a period of ownership by Jarvis Hotels, it was bought by Grant Moon, a catering entrepreneur. It changed hands again, passing into the ownership of Harpreet Singh in 2008 and of Silverton Global in 2013: Silverton Global subsequently re-branded it as a Best Western Hotel.

It is a PEGylated interleukin-2 (IL-2) acting as a CD122-preferential IL-2 pathway agonist designed to activate and proliferate CD8+ T cells and NK cells. It is being developed by Nektar Therapeutics. In August 2019 the FDA granted breakthrough therapy designation to bempegaldesleukin in combination with nivolumab for the treatment of advanced melanoma. It is in phase 3 clinical trials for melanoma and renal cell carcinoma. Mechanism of action Bempegaldesleukin is a recombinant form of human cytokine interleukin-2 conjugated to six releasable polyethylene glycol chains. PEGylation of IL-2 is utilized to alter its receptor binding. PEG chains are located at the region of IL-2 that binds to the IL2Rα subunit of the heterotrimeric IL2Rαβγ complex, reducing its ability to bind and activate the heterotrimer. The IL2Rαβγ complex is constitutively expressed on regulatory T cells (Tregs). Therefore, without the use of mutations, PEGylation reduces the affinity for IL2Rαβγ to a greater extent than for IL2Rβγ (CD122), the receptor complex predominant on CD8+ T cells. When fully PEGylated, it is a pro-drug that has essentially no biological activity. Upon intravenous administration, the PEG chains slowly release to generate active cytokine species. Consequently, it increases the proliferation, activation, and effector function of CD8+ T cells and NK cells within the tumor microenvironment without expanding the undesirable intra-tumoral regulatory T cells. Development Bempegaldesleukin is investigated in combination with other anti-cancer agents. In February 2018 Nektar Therapeutics announced development and commercialization collaboration with Bristol-Myers Squibb to evaluate combination of bempegaldesleukin and nivolumab. In November 2018 Nektar announced collaboration with Pfizer to evaluate combination of Bempegaldesleukin with avelumab and talazoparib or enzalutamide in multiple cancers.

The station operated from June 1978 to 1997 and provided programming by and for the African American community in Cedar Rapids. History The Oakhill-Jackson Economic Development Corporation received the construction permit for a new 10-watt FM radio station on September 28, 1976 after the idea was born at a community meeting in 1974. The station was built with a string of donations: two classrooms from St. Wenceslaus Catholic Church, a tower site donated by Cargill, as well as donated studio equipment and furniture. KOJC planned to include in its programming broadcasts from black churches, Mutual Black Network news, and other specials. The station signed on the air the evening of June 30, 1978, originally operating on weekends only until it expanded to seven-day operation in November. The station had 15 volunteers by year's end, adding the Mutual Black Network newscasts and children's programming in early 1979. Several children aged 5 through 13 were involved in the production of the youth shows. KOJC moved in 1981 to new facilities at 626 Fifth Ave. SE. Three years later, it boosted its power to 200 watts. After a rough period for donations in the early 1980s, the station's financial situation was stabilizing by 1984; one of those donations came as part of a settlement in a dispute over the use of minority contractors at the Cedar Rapids airport. By the mid-1980s, Iowa was home to three of the country's ten African American, community-owned stations: KOJC, KUCB-FM in Des Moines and KBBG in Waterloo, which were all profiled in a 1984 documentary by Iowa Public Television. Further upgrades came in 1989 with a new studio at 1052 Mount Vernon Road SE, its fourth—and final—studio site. Support faded for KOJC in the early 1990s, with fewer donations, increased debt, and an internal struggle among the group's board members, ultimately prompting the station to cease operations in the summer of 1993. In March 1996, the Federal Communications Commission ordered the Oakhill-Jackson Economic Development Corporation to show cause why its license should not be revoked. In the hearing, Oakhill-Jackson failed to appear. Despite an attempt to sell the station to Friendship Communications, owner of KWOF in Waterloo, and obtain reconsideration of the decision to revoke the license and delete the call letters, (Includes letters from Oakhill to the FCC) because Oakhill itself had no intention of returning KOJC to the air, the FCC upheld its decision in September 1997, deleting the license.

Bleszynski Jayich is the Bruker Endowed Chair in Science and Engineering in the Department of Physics at the University of California, Santa Barbara and Associate Director of the campus’s Materials Research Lab. Biography Bleszynski Jayich was raised in Thousand Oaks, California. As the daughter of two physicists, she decided at an early age to dedicate her life to the subject as well. Bleszynski Jayich was also an elite tennis player growing up; she held the rank of No. 1 singles tennis in the United States for athletes 18-and-under. Bleszynski Jayich attended Stanford University and received a B.S. with honors in 2000 as a double major in mathematics and computational science, and physics. There, she conducted research in a collaboration with Stanford, NASA, and the Lockheed Corporation. Steven Chu supervised her undergraduate thesis at Stanford, which was recognized with an award for best honors thesis in physics. At the time, Bleszynski Jayich explained her interest: “I love the problem-solving process. The more you learn, the more of these things you can use as tools in the learning process.” At Stanford, Bleszynski Jayich was named most outstanding sophomore athlete and selected as an NCAA All-American for four years. Bleszynski Jayich pursued her graduate studies in physics at Harvard under the supervision of Robert Westervelt. Her PhD thesis, on the topic \\"Imaging Electrons in Nanoscale Structures\\" (2006), applied scanning probe techniques to illuminate the structure of quantum dots in nanowires. Afterwards, as a postdoctoral researcher at Yale University, Bleszynski Jayich worked with Jack Harris to perform the first measurements of a counter-intuitive quantum mechanical effect in which rings of normal metal conductors are expected to support persistent currents. Her work, which was recognized in 2008 with a L'Oréal-UNESCO For Women in Science Award, identified the minuscule magnetic fields these currents produce by using ultra-sensitive cantilever beams. Next, she expanded her postdoctoral collaboration to include Mikhail Lukin of Harvard to couple nitrogen-vacancy centers in diamond to nanomechanical resonators. In 2010, Bleszynski Jayich joined the physics faculty of University of California, Santa Barbara. The Jayich Lab is the Quantum Sensing and Imaging Group at UCSB, specializing in quantum effects on the nanoscale. Of particular interest to the Jayich Lab is the nanoscale imaging of spin and charge in condensed matter systems. These experiments have applications in quantum and classical computing and biology. Bleszynski Jayich is a principal investigator of the first National Science Foundation Quantum Foundry, based at UCSB. The UC Santa Barbara NSF Quantum Foundry is a major initiative (20 faculty, $25M) seeking to develop new materials with quantum applications.

It was published in September 2019 by New Village Press and is distributed by New York University Press. The book documents the movement by U.S. GIs and veterans in opposition to the Vietnam War, and asserts that this resistance has \\"become an almost secret history.\\" Through essays, oral histories, photographs, documents, poems, and pages of the GI underground press, the book refutes what it calls the \\"post-Vietnam myth\\" of antiwar protesters spitting on returning Vietnam GIs, and instead shows GIs to have been an integral part of the antiwar movement. In an introductory essay, David Cortright, Director of Policy Studies at the Kroc Institute for International Peace Studies at the University of Notre Dame, counters the claim that the U.S. military could have won the Vietnam War had it not been undermined by politicians and the media, and he writes: \\"The dissent and defiance of troops played a decisive role in limiting the U.S. ability to continue the war.\\" He adds: \\"It is arguable that by 1970 U.S. ground troops in Vietnam had ceased to function as an effective fighting force.\\" The book presents evidence for this conclusion. Synopsis The book covers the GI and veteran resistance to the Vietnam War from the very early stages of the war until the signing of the Paris Peace Accords in 1973. It has essays and contributions from members of every branch of the U.S. military, from enlisted and officer, from women and men, from those of many skin colors and walks of life, from the famous and the unknown, from highly decorated combat troops and deserters, from front line grunts and jet pilots. It includes chapters on the behind the scenes civilian supporters and on the next generation of resisters to the Iraq and Afghanistan Wars. The book was inspired by and draws content from the Waging Peace In Vietnam exhibit which opened in the Spring of 2018 at the University of Notre Dame's Kroc Institute for International Peace Studies, in South Bend, Indiana and at the War Remnants Museum in Ho Chi Minh City, in Vietnam. The exhibit and the book draw from many sources including oral histories and photos from the book A Matter of Conscience by Willa Seidenberg and William Short, the GI Press Collection archive at the Wisconsin Historical Society, and the U.S. National Archives. They document that thousands of soldiers, sailors and pilots refused to fight, sail and fly bombing missions in Vietnam, having a profound effect on the antiwar movement, and on the war itself. The exhibit is currently touring the United States.Waging Peace in Vietnam =Early Resisters= The first chapter on early resisters tells of some of the first GIs to publicly oppose the war and lets some of them tell their own stories.

Duncan, a highly decorated Master Sergeant in the U.S. Army Special Forces (\\"Green Berets\\") who resigned in September 1965 just a little over a year after the Gulf of Tonkin incident which led the U.S. to engage more directly in the war. Duncan, a specialist in unconventional warfare, came to recognize through his experiences in battle against Viet Cong guerrillas that they had \\"the support of the people\\" - in fact, he said, they had \\"an overwhelming mandate\\". In February 1966, Duncan appeared on the cover of Ramparts Magazine in uniform saying \\"The whole thing was a lie!\\" and \\"I Quit!\\", \\"The Whole Thing Was a Lie\\", Ramparts, Feb 1966 It mentions the Fort Hood Three, Private First Class James Johnson, Private David Samas, and Private Dennis Mora, who in 1966 became the first three soldiers to publicly refuse to go to Vietnam. They were arrested and their case became a rallying cry for a small but growing antiwar movement. And it has an essay by Howard Levy, an Army Captain and physician assigned to train Green Berets in dermatology treatments until it became clear to him that \\"the Army was developing ploys like this to 'win hearts and minds' in Vietnamese villages - while still burning them to the ground in search-and- destroy missions.\\" In May 1967 he was court-martialed and spent twenty-six months in prison for refusing to carry out his assignment., \\"Army Captain Howard Levy Refuses to Train Green Berets During Vietnam War\\" =The GI Press= Chapter 2 documents the history of the GI underground press. An introductory essay explains how these papers \\"were filled with critical news about the war, cartoons that lampooned the military leadership, updates about soldier protest, and information on where GIs could find legal help.\\" They \\"criticized racism in the military and U.S. society, and analyzed the racist and imperialist nature of the Vietnam War.\\" A recurring feature of many were contests for “Pig of the Month” or “Lifer of the Month.” While conceding the actual number of GI antiwar newspapers can never be known it argues \\"credible estimates range from 144 to nearly 300.\\" Many of them carried irreverent titles mocking war and the military, including A Four Year Bummer, Kill for Peace and Fun Travel Adventure (FTA) which most GIs understood to mean \\"Fuck the Army\\". It documents how the troops who created and circulated these newspapers took serious risks. Army Sergeant Skip Delano, who was stationed at Fort McClellan, Alabama after returning from Vietnam, writes about hiding from the Military Police (MP) in the trunk of a car to avoid six months in the stockade for distributing their paper Left Face. Army soldier Terry Irvin recounts how after they \\"tried and tried\\" to get approval to distribute their underground GI newspaper, the Lewis-McCord Free Press on the Fort Lewis and McChord Air Bases in Washington, they decided to circulate the Declaration of Independence on the Fourth of July. They were surrounded by MPs, arrested and \\"charged with distributing unauthorized literature on base.\\" Irvin describes being up for general court-martial and facing three years in Leavenworth until the press got wind of what happened. The charges were quickly dropped. These newspapers often received letters from GIs. One of these is reproduced telling of a soldier organized antiwar parade on Memorial Day at Long Binh Army Base in Vietnam; the result was eight Article 15s (a military administrative hearing) for disturbing the peace. The soldier ended his story saying, \\"Can You Dig That? We had a parade in Vietnam and got busted for disturbing the peace. What can I say — FTA.” A black veteran writes about the impact of Muhammad Ali's \\"No Vietcong ever called me nigger\\", and says he realized he was \\"living this contradiction of being a black soldier in the land of another man of color and terrorizing him.\\" He started writing to turn from the violence of the war. =GI Coffeehouses= This chapter explores the history of GI Coffeehouses, which were small cafes and political centers created mainly by civilian antiwar activists near military bases as a method of supporting antiwar and anti-military sentiment among GIs. The first one was established in January 1968 outside Fort Jackson in Columbia, South Carolina and the last closed in 1974. Fort Jackson was one of the Army's central training centers for soldiers heading to Vietnam and the UFO coffeehouse there is described as \\"an instant hit\\" by David Parsons in an introductory essay. Parsons, the author of a book on the GI Coffeehouse movement, goes on to say the UFO was \\"[d]ecorated with rock-and-roll posters\\" and \\"quickly became a popular gathering spot for local GIs — and a target of significant hostility from military officials, city authorities, and outraged citizens\\". Hostility was visited on all these centers, many of which were in pro-military towns adjacent to military bases. \\"Without exception,\\" the introduction continues, \\"every GI coffeehouse in the network was subjected to attacks from a variety of sources — investigated by the FBI and congressional committees, infiltrated by law enforcement, harassed by military authorities, and, in a number of startling cases, violently terrorized by local vigilantes.\\" Several civilian organizers tell their stories here including Jane Fonda who describes being smuggled into Fort Carson by active duty servicemen in the trunk of a car. Overall, a picture is painted of a GI coffeehouse network that \\"played a central role in some of the GI movement's most significant actions\\". =Petitioning and Marching= The next two chapters include essays, photos and stories about many of the protest methods used by antiwar GIs. There was the November 9, 1969 full page ad in The New York Times calling for a large mobilization against the war on November 15, 1969 in Washington, DC. It was signed by 1,365 active-duty military personnel, including 142 from Fort Bliss in El Paso, Texas a generally pro-war town where there was a particularly active chapter of GIs for Peace. A copy of this petition made its way to the troops in Vietnam and Dave Blalock writes about its impact on his Army unit where they decided to wear black armbands on the 15th. He says, \\"we’re all wearing black armbands. It was like 100 percent of the enlisted men, everybody’s wearing a black armband, including some of the war doctors and the helicopter pilots.\\" In 1970 the Reservists Committee to Stop the War collected \\"more than 2,200 signatures of Reservists and National Guardsmen\\" on a petition calling for the immediate U.S. withdrawal from the war. And on October 9, 1971, when six men from the Army's Firebase Pace in Vietnam refused to go out on patrol and were threatened with court-martial, \\"[s]ixty-five out of one hundred men in B Company signed a petition in a show of solidarity.\\" Navy Nurse Susan Schnall tells of her creative method for distributing antiwar material: \\"A pilot friend and I rented a single-engine plane, filled it with thousands of leaflets, and dropped them over Bay Area military bases: Treasure Island, Yerba Buena Island, Oak Knoll, the Presidio, and the deck of the USS Ranger at Alameda Naval Air Station.\\" They were organizing for a GI and Veterans March for Peace on October 12, 1968 and when the day arrived she marched in her uniform along with five hundred other active duty military personnel (a two-page photo captures this event). David Cline was a combat infantryman in Vietnam who was wounded twice and awarded Purple Hearts and a Bronze Star. He writes about being wounded and finding a book in the hospital called The New Legions where Donald Duncan (see above) talked about his experience in Vietnam and why he resigned from the military. Cline felt Duncan was basically saying \\"we're fighting on the wrong side\\" and said \\"it made a lot of sense to me because that’s what I saw.\\" Cline went on to join the GI movement, smuggle underground newspapers onto Fort Hood, become a national coordinator of Vietnam Veterans Against the War and president of Veterans For Peace. Several photos highlight actions by Vietnam Veterans Against the War. In the fall of 1970 \\"they marched through New Jersey in a mock 'search-and- destroy' exercise called Operation RAW (Rapid American Withdrawal) to show Americans the terror inflicted on civilians in Vietnam by U.S. troops.\\" And on April 23, 1971 \\"[e]ight hundred U.S. veterans individually tossed their medals and ribbons onto the steps of the [U.S.] Capitol [in Washington, DC] to denounce the war and proclaim their shame at having been decorated for serving in a war they believed was unjust.\\" =Exposing War Crimes= Chapter 6 opens with an essay by Michael Uhl who led a combat intelligence team in Vietnam as a First Lieutenant with the 11th Infantry Brigade. He argues that My Lai, the mass murder of unarmed South Vietnamese civilians by U.S. troops, was just the tip of the iceberg; \\"Many returning veterans were intimately aware from their own combat tours that U.S. forces were routinely committing atrocities, aimed mostly at civilians.\\" He describes the National Veterans Inquiry and the Winter Soldier Investigation, which both occurred in 1970 and gave a platform to dozens of veterans who testified to America's atrocities in the war, \\"from unprovoked mass murder, to the poisoning of Vietnam’s crops and forests with tons of chemical herbicide, to the widespread use of torture during interrogations.\\" Paul Cox, a Marine squad leader, writes of witnessing the murder of several women, children and an old man and declares it \\"turned me into an antiwar activist.\\" Ron Haeberle, an Army photographer, describes taking photographs of the My Lai Massacre and the difficulties he had in getting them made public, while Ron Ridenhour, a helicopter gunner in Vietnam, describes his role in exposing the massacre. Ridenhour gathered eyewitness accounts from other soldiers, and after being ignored by 30 members of Congress and Pentagon officials, took his story to Seymour Hersh who won a Pulitzer Prize for his reporting on My Lai. Additional contributions are from Dennis Stout who tried to report fourteen war crimes and received a personal threats against his life and from John Kerry, the 68th U.S. Secretary of State, who represented Vietnam Veterans Against the War testifying against the war before the U.S. Senate in 1971. =Other Forms of Resistance= The forms of protest against the war were as varied as the individuals involved. One extremely common form was unauthorized absence, including desertion. Citing congressional testimony, an essay by Ron Carver one of the book's editors, argues that by 1971 \\"desertion and AWOL rates had reached the highest levels in modern U.S. history.\\" He cites research that estimated \\"absenteeism deprived the military of about one million man-years of service\\" He also points out that as ground troops became increasingly unreliable in Vietnam, the U.S. turned to an air war but soon found \\"desertion rates explod[ing] in the Navy and Air Force.\\"(p. 87) Essays from draft resisters and deserters discuss why they made their decisions and how they feel about it now. Other more militant methods have been little discussed prior to this. Editor David Cortright argues African Americans \\"were among the most defiant troops in fighting against racism and the war and posed a significant challenge to the military’s mostly white power structure.\\" All of the military branches experienced major racial rebellions whose roots \\"lay in patterns of racial discrimination, growing militancy among African American troops, and a general crisis of morale\\". In August 1968, a prison rebellion erupted at Long Binh Jail at Bien Hoa, northeast of Saigon \\"in which hundreds of prisoners fought with military police\\". In the summer of 1969, fighting over an incident of racial discrimination at Camp Lejeune in North Carolina \\"left fourteen Marines injured and one dead\\". A Marine internal investigation revealed that \\"many white officers and NCOs retain prejudices and deliberately practice them.\\" At Travis Air Force Base in northern California in May 1971, the perceived unjust arrest of several black airmen led \\"more than two hundred enlisted members, including some whites, marched in several groups to free the arrested troops.\\" When they were met by more than three hundred military police backed by civilian police from neighboring communities, more than \\"six hundred airmen were drawn into the resulting brawl. An officers’ club was burned to the ground and dozens of troops were injured. One hundred and thirty-five service members were arrested, most of them black; ten people were injured, and a civilian firefighter died.\\" In late 1972, the Navy experienced its most serious racial uprising aboard the USS Kitty Hawk and the \\"first mass mutiny in the history of the U.S. Navy\\" on the USS Constellation. Cortright argues \\"The resistance of African American members of the military against racism and war was a major factor in the collapse of discipline, morale, and combat effectiveness during the Vietnam War.\\" Essays from black veterans of rebellions and resistance discuss their growing awareness of the connection between racism and the war. Keith Mather, writes about his role in the October 1968 Presidio mutiny at the Presidio stockade in San Francisco, California which was sparked when a prisoner was murdered by a military guard and grew into 27 prisoners sitting down in protest against conditions in the stockade and against the war. Another little discussed aspect of the war is fragging, the deliberate killing or attempted killing by a soldier of a fellow soldier, usually a superior officer or non-commissioned officer (NCO), which Cortright calls the \\"most horrific indication of the breakdown of the armed forces\\". He says exact numbers of fraggings are not known but recent studies estimate \\"600 to 850 or possibly more.\\" He states, \\"The threat of fragging became a pervasive presence that loomed over many units in Vietnam and fundamentally altered the relationship between commanders and their troops.\\" A witness to one of these fraggings writes, \\"I asked, 'What’s going on?' This fellow answered, 'They have fragged the \\"lifer hooch\\" as a warning because they were getting too gung ho.'\\" =Redefining Patriotism= Chapter 10 contains essays from a POWs, the son of a POW, GI and civilian resisters, and an Army Major who helped end the My Lai Massacre. They each describe how and/or why they (or their father) turned against the war. Bob Chenoweth was a helicopter pilot shot down in Vietnam and captured by the Viet Cong. In the \\"Hanoi Hilton\\" POW camp he \\"learned about Vietnam's history, culture, and people.\\" He saw films of \\"the Winter Soldier Investigation held in the U.S. by Vietnam Veterans Against the War\\" and recognized that \\"GI activists and veterans\\" were providing \\"an undeniable voice about what was being done in our name.\\" He spoke out against the war and said of his captors, \\"These are people from whom I learned a new way of looking at the world, who protected me and sent me home a better person than when I left.\\" Tom Wilber writes about his POW father Gene, a \\"religious, conservative, right-leaning, career military officer\\", who came to realize the war was wrong. While in captivity he made statements against the war and defended them upon his return home. He \\"announced publicly that the statements he made while in captivity were voluntary\\" and insisted that during his entire \\"time in prison, he \\"received shelter, clothing, hygiene, and medical care\\", \\"never went a day without food\\", and \\"was not tortured.\\" Carl Dix, a black Army enlisted man from Baltimore, describes showing up at Fort Bragg only to see a large sign outside the base, \\"WELCOME TO KKK COUNTRY\\". He discusses how this and other things impacted his \\"developing black consciousness.\\" He read Malcolm X and followed news of the Black Panther Party and heard about the December 1969 murders of Fred Hampton and Mark Clark by the Chicago police. Then he found out about the police attack on the Los Angeles Black Panther headquarters \\"where tanks and mortars were set up in the streets of L.A.\\" He writes, \\"This war isn’t just something over there, it’s here, too, and I have to decide what side I’m on. I decided I couldn’t be a part of the war in Vietnam; I couldn’t go fight for America.\\" He and five other soldiers at Fort Lewis refused to go to the war and became the \\"Fort Lewis Six\\". Dix spent eighteen months in Leavenworth military prison. John Tuma, was assigned to an Army intelligence unit and soon realized he was expected to participate in and supervise the torture of prisoners for information. After refusing he was threatened with court-martial and barely survived two attempts on his life. Hugh Thompson was an Army helicopter pilot in Vietnam and took heroic action to stop a number of killings at My Lai by threatening and blocking U.S. soldiers and preventing them from murdering unarmed civilians. He evacuated a number of civilians by air and reported the atrocities by radio several times. He writes, \\"I set my aircraft down between the civilians and the GIs, and I told my crew, 'Y'all cover me. If these bastards open up on me or these people, you open up on them.' They said, 'Yes, sir, we’re with you.'\\" =Navy and Air Force Resisters= This chapter contains essays covering the resistance within the U.S. Navy and Air Force. The lead essay is about the Stop Our Ship (SOS) movement which mobilized thousands of sailors and civilians to stop, disrupt and frustrate the U.S. Navy's ability to conduct the war. The war is described as \\"a bully's war, a war of domination and conquest, an imperial war.\\" Examples are given of sailors refusing to sail, taking sanctuary in churches and marching in demonstrations; antiwar petitions and underground newspapers onboard Navy ships, civilians attempting to blockade ships, sailors jumping overboard to join blockading civilians, and crew members forming the letters SOS on a flight deck. An ex-Navy flight instructor flew multiple times over San Diego dragging a banner encouraging sailors aboard the USS Constellation to stay home. Pictures of underground newspapers and flyers are shown with headlines like \\"Military Revolting\\" and \\"A Warship Can Be Stopped.\\" Naval sabotage also increased in tandem with the SOS movement. \\"The Navy reported seventy-four instances of sabotage during 1972, most on aircraft carriers.\\" In the Air Force, resistance among airmen increased as the military shifted more and more to the air war. One well known resister was Captain Michael Heck an American B-52 pilot who refused to continue flying bombing missions over North Vietnamese targets in late 1972. He explained, \\"I'm just a tiny cog in a big wheel.... but a man has to answer to himself first.\\" An Air Force staff sergeant wrote to his Senator, \\"The obviously insane slaughter of innocent people is not at all conducive to restful nights. The flight crews are simply 'fed up' with the 'useless killing.' Aborted takeoffs are becoming increasingly common.\\" Charlie Clements, a graduate of the Air Force Academy who flew more than 50 missions in Vietnam, was flying his C-130 on \\"a secret mission to Cambodia, and I remember looking out of the plane and seeing vast areas that looked like the moon. Only one thing did that: B-52s. I realized we were conducting massive bombing operations there.\\" He decided the war was immoral and refused to fly. The Air Force responded by committing him to a psychiatric hospital. =The Next Generation Resists= Chapter 12 contains essays from and about veterans and GIs of the Iraq and Afghanistan Wars who followed in the footsteps of their Vietnam War forebearers. Editor David Cortright describes the antiwar movement against the Iraq and Afghanistan Wars as \\"smaller than the Vietnam-era resistance\\" both inside and outside the military. He says the \\"Iraq Veterans Against the War (IVAW), patterned after its Vietnam-era namesake, Vietnam Veterans Against the War\\" was \\"never a large organization, with less than a thousand members and eight chapters at its peak in early 2008\\", but argues \\"it became the public face of dissent within a military increasingly plagued by poor morale.\\" According to Cortright, \\"The most significant action organized by IVAW was the Winter Soldier hearing. The goal was to create a kind of truth commission that would cut through the propaganda of military and political leaders to tell Americans what was actually happening in Iraq and Afghanistan.\\" About two hundred veterans and a few active-duty soldiers participated in these hearings in March 2008, with approximately fifty giving testimony. \\"Over three days of often emotional, poignant testimony at a labor center near Washington, D.C., the veterans told stories of their deployments in Iraq and Afghanistan, addressing themes such as disregard for the rules of engagement, dehumanization of the enemy, the breakdown of the military, sexual abuse, and profiteering by military contractors.\\" Kelly Dougherty, an Army MP (Military Police), writes about the pervasive \\"culture of chauvinism and dehumanization\\" and said \\"we displayed a disturbing level of contempt towards the Iraqi people.\\" She also speaks of the \\"stress of living within the military’s abusive and misogynistic culture.\\" She felt she \\"could never feel safe, even when I returned to my base.\\" Jonathan Hutto, a black Navy sailor aboard the USS Theodore Roosevelt, was drawn into resistance by the racism he felt and observed in the Navy. \\"In February 2006,\\" he writes, \\"some white petty officers displayed a hangman’s noose in my face.\\" He knew he was \\"ideologically opposed\\" to the war and in June 2006 joined with eleven other active-duty troops to launch the Appeal for Redress to end the war in Iraq. Camilo Mejia, a Nicaraguan U.S. Army infantryman, writes of his decision to refuse to return to the Iraq War. While stationed in Ar Ramadi, he was shocked to see the mistreatment of Iraqis, including \\"arbitrary detentions, torture, and shootings of unarmed civilians.\\" While on furlough back in the U.S. he decided to take a public stance against the war and refused to go back. \\"My decision landed me in a military prison for nine months and prompted Amnesty International to declare me a prisoner of conscience.\\" =Confronting the Legacies of War= In this chapter, we hear from the Vietnamese, from veterans who feel a responsibility for what they did, and from the daughter of a veteran poisoned by Agent Orange. Madame Binh, Nguyễn Thị Bình, represented the National Liberation Front (NLF) during peace negotiations and played a major role in the Paris Peace Accords. She addresses American veterans and thanks those who opposed the war and joined organization like Vietnam Veterans Against the War and Veterans for Peace. She goes on to thank those who have moved beyond the past \\"to reconcile our two nations, to normalize relations and build friendly and cooperative relationships between our two peoples.\\" And she expresses her appreciation for those \\"American veteran organizations [who] have also extended material support through humanitarian projects for Vietnam such as building schools and clinics.\\" Tran Xuan Thao recalls as a child being implored by her mother \\"to grab hold of a tree\\" to protect herself as American warplanes flew overhead. But her message is one of friendship as she explains, \\"We know that for many years, so many Americans defied and resisted their government’s war. And for all these years we have been able to differentiate the actions of your government from the love and solidarity of your people.\\" Chuck Searcy was in Army Intelligence in Vietnam and turned against the war as he discovered it was based on lies. He returned to Vietnam in 1992 and made up his mind to help the Vietnamese recover from the war. He helped found an orthopedic workshop at a children's hospital in Hanoi and \\"learned that more than 100,000 children and adults had been killed or injured by unexploded ordnance\\" in the years between 1975 and 1995. \\"Every week\\", he writes, \\"there was a new report in the newspaper or on TV of a farmer or another child being killed or injured.\\" He is still helping the Vietnamese recover and says he feels a \\"responsibility as an American, as a Vietnam vet, for what we did\\". Fredy Champagne was an infantry rifleman in Vietnam in 1965. Years later he felt he \\"had unfinished business with the Vietnamese people\\", and in 1988 he launched an organization which returned to Vietnam to help Vietnamese workers construct a Friendship Medical Clinic. Heather Bowser was about five years old when she went to her first Agent Orange awareness rally. She was born in 1972, \\"two months premature, missing several of my fingers, my big toe on my left foot, and my right leg below the knee.\\" Her parents had no idea why until 1978 when they saw a Vietnam veteran named Paul Reutershan on The Today Show saying \\"I got killed in Vietnam and didn't know it.\\" It turned out her father, who was stationed at Long Binh Army base in Vietnam, was sprayed daily with the dioxin-tainted herbicide called Agent Orange, which in addition to causing enormous environmental damage creates major health problems and birth defects in those exposed and their children. She writes about having \\"traveled to Vietnam four times to meet children who are still being born like me, due to residual dioxin in their environment.\\" She continues, \\"My activism has taken me around the world, but it hasn’t yet persuaded the U.S. government to take responsibility for what it did to those affected by Agent Orange.\\" =Supporting, Recording and Recovering the Legacy of GI Dissent= As the book concludes we learn about organizations and individuals who supported the GI and veterans anti-Vietnam War movement and who have worked to preserve and foster its history and legacy. One of the most important was the United States Servicemen's Fund (USSF). USSF helped to support GI Coffeehouses, antiwar entertainment and GI underground newspapers. While working with USSF, Howard Levy suggested an \\"antiwar, pro-GI, Bob Hope–style spectacle, which would come to be called the FTA Show.\\" Involving Jane Fonda, Donald Sutherland, Len Chandler, Holly Near, and others, it \\"became one of USSF’s main attractions, and drew enormous audiences of GIs, both within the United States, and in Asia.\\" Alan Pogue, an award-winning photojournalist, was a combat medic in Chu Lai, Vietnam in 1967. He writes about how he \\"became an atheist in a foxhole\\" and a photographer by using his Kodak Instamatic in Vietnam. One of the most remarkable repositories of documents and information on the GI and veterans resistance to the Vietnam War is located in the GI Press Collection of the Wisconsin Historical Society. This collection \\"contains over 88,000 page images with searchable text taken from more than 2,400 periodicals and other items such as pamphlets and posters created by or for U.S. military personnel during the Vietnam War era.\\", GI Press Collection of the Wisconsin Historical Society Here we learn of the tireless efforts of James Lewes, who spent years, much of it single-handedly, compiling and digitizing this collection. William Short and Willa Seidenberg, many of whose photographs and oral histories are contained in the book, write about their five-year project document the resistance to the war. An Afterword asks why \\"this important story become an almost secret history?\\" Answering that it has been erased by a \\"rightward shift in U.S politics\\" which has worked to turn the \\"most vibrant and diverse antiwar movement in U.S. history\\" into \\"a band of craven, self-righteous, draft-dodging campus hippies\\". Waging Peace, it argues, \\"gives us back an important piece\\" of our history. Reception Waging Peace in Vietnam has received positive reviews. The Progressive magazine called it \\"a new and fiercely compelling anthology about a wide swath of U.S. troops that were crucial to opposing the Vietnam War. The volume offers 'an almost-secret history' of a vast movement that ground down the high-powered U.S. war machine in Vietnam to a barely-functioning crawl.\\" CounterPunch magazine praised the book for giving \\"long overdue credit to anti-war organizing by men and women in uniform, and their civilian allies and funders.\\" A Daily Collegian review quoted Christian Appy, a history professor at the University of Massachusetts, “There is really nothing like it in this vast literature of more than 40,000 books regarding the Vietnam War.... Waging Peace in Vietnam [is] the foremost catalogue of firsthand accounts of G.I. resistance in Vietnam in existence.\\" Seymour Hersh, the Pulitzer Prize recipient for his disclosure the My Lai Massacre, says of the book, \\"To be in a military unit and oppose a war that had the blessing of one American president after another took extraordinary courage — the kind that was displayed by only a few in the Congress and, sad to say, by not many more in the media. The men and women who spoke out, often at great cost, during the immoral and unnecessary war in Vietnam are voices that need to be heard again and again, as they are in Waging Peace in Vietnam.\\", Seymour Hersh Writing about the Waging Peace in Vietnam exhibit, Thomas Maresca of USA Today says \\"Hippies made the history books, but servicemembers risked prison\\". Hans Johnson, a contributing writer for HuffPost commented: \\"As the authors document — with a splendid compilation of essays & primary source material — rank-&-file, officer, & civilian opposition to the carnage changed the ground tactics & aerial bombardment strategy of the brutal 15-year war & hastened its end.\\", Hans Johnson Review See also * A Matter of Conscience * Concerned Officers Movement * Court-martial of Howard Levy * Donald W.

The robot takes a list of controller inputs which it then sends to a console such as a Nintendo Entertainment System or Super Nintendo Entertainment System (SNES) directly via signals to the controller ports. TASBot is known for its appearances at popular speedrunning events such as Games Done Quick.  History  The idea for TASBot began around 2009 when a user of the tool-assisted speedrun website TASVideos created a device which could send a predetermined list of inputs to a Nintendo Entertainment System directly via its controller ports. Over the next few years a number of different people developed similar devices and techniques to automatically play video game console games directly through their hardware. Allan Cecil, known by his username dwangoAC, first developed TASBot by building on the concepts and guides for these earlier devices along with assistance from their creators. The robot is now developed and maintained by a team. The first version of TASBot – which was initially named ROBBerry Pi for the R.O.B. model exterior and Raspberry Pi internals – debuted at Awesome Games Done Quick (AGDQ) in 2014, playing Gradius, Mario Kart 64, and Super Mario World. TASBot contains a \\"replay board\\", which takes a predetermined list of inputs from a Linux machine and uses them to send signals directly to a console's controller ports. The list of inputs is written and recorded manually, tested on an emulator. Controller inputs need to be timed extremely accurately; some live runs failed as a result of slight electromagnetic interference from crossed wires.  Speedruns  At its debut during AGDQ in 2014, TASBot played Super Mario World. By leveraging an arbitrary code execution glitch, the run allowed players to play Pong and Snake inside the game. At AGDQ 2015, TASBot used the same exploit to code a copy of Super Mario Bros. into Super Mario World, writing the game to the SNES and then playing it. It also played Pokémon Red, during which the event's Twitch chat was fed into the game in realtime. During the AGDQ event in 2016, it wrote a Super Mario Maker level editor onto an SNES in realtime while it was running a game, an improvement over stopping and then replacing the game as in previous events.. At the summer SGDQ event of the same year, TASBot \\"completed\\" Super Mario Bros. 3 in less than one second by performing almost 8,000 inputs per second. At AGDQ 2017, after demonstrating similar runs from previous years, TASBot appeared to play Super Mario 64 and Portal, and make a Skype call on a SNES. This was achieved by streaming video and audio to the console after taking control of it via The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past. The bandwidth was sufficient to display a 128×112 video at 10 frames per second. At SGDQ 2018, TASBot ran Celeste. At AGDQ 2019, the TASBot team showcased MASHBot, a new robot which physically presses controller buttons, rather than directly sending signals via the controller port. Initially designed to work with a Game Boy Advance SP, the robot debuted by playing Nintendo DS game Super Scribblenauts via the touchscreen. In 2020 the team set up TASBot to play on a Nintendo Switch. In this case, however, the source code will not be made available, to avoid legal issues with Nintendo.

She gave the name to Schur complements and is the namesake of the Haynsworth inertia additivity formula. She was known for the \\"absolute originality\\" of her mathematical formulations, her \\"strong and independent mind\\", her \\"fine sense of mathematical elegance\\", and her \\"strong mixture of the traditional and unconventional\\". Education and career Haynsworth was born and died in Sumter, South Carolina. She competed in mathematics at the statewide level in junior high school, and graduated in 1937 with a bachelor's degree in mathematics from Coker College. She earned a master's degree in 1939 from Columbia University in New York City, and became a high school mathematics teacher. As part of the war effort for World War II, she left teaching to work at the Aberdeen Proving Ground; after the war, she became a lecturer at an extension program of the University of Illinois in Galesburg, Illinois. She began her doctoral studies at Columbia University in 1948, but soon transferred to the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, where she completed her doctorate in 1952. Her dissertation, Bounds for Determinants with Dominant Main Diagonal, was supervised by Alfred Brauer. In 1951, Haynsworth took a faculty position at Wilson College (Pennsylvania). She moved to the National Bureau of Standards in 1955, and returned to academia in 1960 as a faculty member in mathematics at Auburn University. According to Haynsworth, the interview with department chair William Vann Parker at which she was offered the job consisted entirely of working on a research problem in linear algebra with Parker. At Auburn, Haynsworth eventually became the doctoral advisor to 17 graduate students. She was named a research professor in 1965, and chaired the Southeastern Section of the Mathematical Association of America for 1976–1977. She retired in 1983. Research Haynsworth's early research, including her dissertation, concerned the determinants of diagonally dominant matrices, and variants of the Gershgorin circle theorem for bounding the locations of the eigenvalues of matrices. Her later work involved cones of matrices. It is for two works that she published in 1968 that Haynsworth is particularly known. One of these identified and named the Schur complement, a concept that Haynsworth had already been using in her own work since 1959. In a second paper in 1968 she used this concept to prove what is now known as the Haynsworth inertia additivity formula. This formula provides a decomposition of the triple of numbers of positive, negative, and zero eigenvalues of a matrix into a sum of the triples defined in the same way for a block and its Schur complement in a partitioned Hermitian matrix.

Early life and career Price was born to the Reverend H. Ward Price around 1886 and attended St. Catherine's College, Cambridge. = Journalism= After having some articles published by The Captain magazine, Price wrote to the Daily Mail asking to have a proposed walk across Europe financed. The proposed articles were turned down but Price was taken on as a reporter, 'paid by results'. After a year this arrangement resulted in him being given a five-year contract. Colonel Sherbrooke-Walker recalled Price in this period when he came to report on a scout camp at Wisley:  Foreign correspondent In 1910 he reported from Turkey and the First Balkan War. Following this, Price became the Daily Mail's Paris Correspondent at the age of 26. The assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand saw Price dispatched to Vienna to report on the funeral.  First World War The outbreak of the First World War saw Price return to Turkey to cover the Gallipoli campaign on behalf of the Newspaper Proprietors Association members. Following the evacuation he wrote: After covering the evacuation which ended the campaign he moved to the Salonika front. Feeling things had quietened there he redeployed to the Italian Front and witnessed the retreat from Caporetto. He turned down a CBE for his wartime reporting, preferring to wait until combatants had been honoured.  Inter-War years In 1919 Price attended the meetings in Paris that paved the way for the Treaty of Versailles. It was here he interviewed Marshal Foch for what became a four column piece. He attended further conferences in Cannes, Genoa and Lausanne before following the French Foreign Legion in Morocco in 1933. A 1928 advertisement for a share offering in Northcliffe Newspapers Limited lists Price as a Company Director. He is also listed as Director of the Associated Newspapers Ltd arm of the company.  European dictators and appeasement The 1930s saw Price carry out several interviews with Adolf Hitler and Benito Mussolini. During Anschluss, the German annexation of Austria, Price accompanied Hitler's party as they entered Vienna. Of his interviews with Hitler, journalist John Simpson noted: In newsreel footage of the scenes in Vienna, Price can be seen near Hitler on the balcony of the Hofburg Palace. With the Munich Crisis, he covered the visit of Neville Chamberlain to Berchtesgarden and witnessed the entry of German troops in the Sudetenland. Reporting on the concentration camps Price wrote:  Second World War Price returned to his work as a war correspondent at the start of the Second World War, working for three months at Arras. However, with the conditions of the time there was little to report, so Price toured through south-east Europe. He visited Turkey, Romania, Yugoslavia and Italy. He did not return to the war until 1942, when he covered the fighting in North Africa.  Post-war period Believing it may be the beginning of a Third World War, Price travelled to the Korean War in 1950 after learning of the outbreak while in Canada.

After resuming his career in India as 2nd Assistant Commissioner Hyderabad, Tweedie was promoted to 1st Assistant Commissioner, before returning to Britain in 1876, and marrying Emily Whitmore in 1877. Tweedie was then named as Resident at Mandalay, with this promotion later cancelled before he could take up the position. At the outbreak of the Second Anglo-Afghan War, Tweedie was appointed as Political Staff Officer to Major-General Robert Bright, before being appointed as Political Agent 1st Class Eastern States (Rajputana). Tweedie was then appointed as Resident of Turkish Arabia in Baghdad in 1881, a role which involved inspecting all aspects of local life, including the trade in Arabian Horses which he was especially interested in. He was named as a Companion of the Order of the Star of India in March 1885. Writing Tweedie had his treatise on Arabian Horses, 'The Arabian Horse, His Country and His People', published in 1894 by William Blackwood & Sons. Later life, death and funeral After retiring to Scotland, Tweedie purchased property in Dunscore, where he built a Manor House costing £23,000. He died in 1914, shortly after the outbreak of World War One having left detailed instructions for his funeral.. With no heirs and his wife Emily having died in 1912, his estate was left to Edinburgh University.

Opened in 1907 served by trains between East Kilbride and Blantyre until 1924The Hidden Glasgow Forum and after used as an excursion platform for the Calderwood Estate pleasure grounds until closure in 1939 due to war time shortages. History The line to East Kilbride was opened in 1868 as part of the Busby Railway, operated by the Caledonian Railway Company from Glasgow via Busby which was a spur from the Glasgow to Barrhead railway at Pollokshaws. In 1888 the line was extended eastwards to meet the Hamilton and Strathaven Railway at Hunthill Junction near High Blantyre (a locality which had a station, but just south of the junction meaning the new connecting line did not stop there) via an intermediate halt at Calderwood Glen with a timetabled services until 1924. A triangular junction existed at Hunthill where the Strathaven line joined, then the line proceeded towards Auchinraith Junction where it joined the surviving Hamiton – Blantyre section of line. The East Kilbride and Blantyre extension never saw a great deal of traffic and passenger services were withdrawn during the 1914–18 war, with complete closure coming about as a result of WWII war shortages, after which the line was cut back to Nerston where it serviced local industries. The Calderwood Estate, was taken over by the Scottish Co-operative Wholesale Society in 1904 for fruit growing. The estate was previously owned by the Maxwell of Calderwood family. The estate and its castle, now demolished, became an early example of a country park, albeit non-statutory, and the station was built to serve it.RailScot - Calderwood Glen Platform Calderwood Glen was opened as a pleasure ground and Calderwood Castle was used as the Co-operative Society museum for a short time, but more lastingly as a co-operative venue, and from 1914-1918 the building housed Belgian refugees. =Infrastructure= The station was located on the south-western side of the single track line with a single name board 'Calderwoodglen' supported on old rails, a plain wooden fence, one wooden platform surfaced with grit, with a small shelter at the northern end, but with no lighting. It lay to the east of the railway overbridge and a path from the road through an old quarry led to the platform and its shelter. No sidings or goods facilities were present and no signalling.Lanarkshire XI.14 (Blantyre; Cambuslang; East Kilbride) Publication date:1912 Revised:1910 Levelled: 1910 =Remains on site= The railway bridge on the line towards East Kilbride has been removed however the stone railway embankment still survives.

(Note: On p. 192 this obituary has the misspelling \\"John Jamison\\" instead of \\"John Jamieson\\". John Calhoun Jamieson (1924–1983) was a pioneer of high-pressure research and a professor of geophysics and researcher in the Institute for the Study of Metals at the University of Chicago.) Alvin Van Valkenburg, Jr. graduated in 1936 from Schenectady's Union College with a B.S. in geology and in 1938 from the University of Colorado Boulder with an M.S. in mineralogy and petrology. After returning to Schenectady to teach at Union College, he moved to the Boston area, where he worked from 1941 to 1945 at the Charleston Navy Yard as a physicist in charge of degaussing ships. During WWII he enrolled as a graduate student at Harvard University, where he studied under Percy Bridgman and the mineralogist Esper S. Larsen, Jr. (1879–1961). In 1945 Van Valkenburg became employed at the National Bureau of Standards (NBS) in Washington, DC. From 1945 to 1946 he pursued graduate studies at Johns Hopkins University. He married Elsie Victoria Erling, whom he met in Washington, on the 1st of June, 1946 at the Ebenezer Lutheran Church in Minneapolis. Van Valkenburg is generally considered the originator of the practice of placing a washer-shaped gasket of extremely thin (about .3 mm) metal foil between the two diamond faces of the DAC. The gasket (made of a metal such as rhenium or tungsten) flows under ultra-high pressure and fills the central hole with fluid to achieve hydrostatic conditions. The tiny sample to be analyzed is compressed between the two opposing culets (tips) of diamond. The gasket is used to maintain the sample's contact with the culets, where the pressure is at a maximum. In 1964 he left the NBS and became employed at the National Science Foundation (NSF). There he was director of the geochemistry program from 1964 to 1970 and retired in 1974. From 1974 to 1980 he was a guest investigator at the Geophysical Laboratory. In 1980 he moved to Tucson, Arizona and transferred his small business of manufacturing and selling DACs from Washington, DC to Tucson, where he was a business partner with his son, Eric. In 1986 the Franklin Institute awarded Van Valkenburg the John Price Wetherill Medal for his co-invention of the DAC, which \\"has revolutionized high pressure research, by allowing static pressures equivalent to that in the earth's core to be produced in the laboratory.\\" Upon his death in 1991 Alvin Van Valkenburg was survived by his widow, his son, two daughters, and two grandchildren.

Adolph Bissinger, Samuel Bissinger, Louis Bissinger, and Louis Gerstle founded the business in the 1880s. The site has been the subject of contamination cleanup efforts and for prospective waterfront redevelopment. History The Bissinger Wool Pullery was founded by Adolph Bissinger, Samuel Bissinger, Louis Bissinger, and Louis Gerstle in the 1880s. The pullery's history in Troutdale can be traced to Samuel Bissinger, a Jewish immigrant from Bavaria who lived in Portland, Oregon. Bissinger, who arrived in the United States when he was 16 years old, grew into an energetic promoter of the Portland area, joined numerous social groups, and was respected for his ideas and judgment. He decided to move his family's pullery out of Sellwood, Oregon, into Troutdale to an eight acre parcel located on Macadam Road at the west bank of the Sandy River. It opened for business in 1925. By the 1930s, the pullery carried a weekly payroll of roughly $1,700, and it is credited for keeping Troutdale alive during the Great Depression. The plant thrived and operated for decades. Eventually, near the beginning of 1970, the owners ceased operation when demand for their product declined as consumers increased their use of synthetic materials and competing with inexpensive imports became difficult. In 1972, a businessman named Don Bennett opened a cabinet-making operation at the abandoned facility. His son later purchased the business and continued production until 1999. The various activities on the property may have been responsible for generating wastes containing chromium and volatile organic compounds, which were found on the site. Sometime prior to 2006, Gresham Fire and Emergency Services condemned the building. A holding company, Eastwinds Development, which was owned by Junki Yoshida, purchased the land in 2000. Yoshida anticipated redevelopment of the site with a hotel and resort project. However, subsequent legal proceedings failed to force Columbia Gorge Outlets to allow road building through their mall. The outlets largely blocked access to the site, and without the road, Eastwinds Development was able to force the city of Troutdale to purchase the site. Operations The pullery facility was a plant that processed dead sheep. The hides were removed from the animals, and the wool and skins were processed for sale. The carcasses were buried on the site. Site cleanup Before Eastwinds Development could proceed with any proposed development, the site required environmental cleanup due to assorted contamination. The buried sheep carcasses decomposed in a manner which left the remains of an iridescent sludge that caused concern regarding stench. Additionally, test pits revealed worrisome levels of contaminants which included petroleum hydrocarbons, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), and phenol. Furthermore, some concerning levels of chlorinated solvents such as chlorobenzene; 1,1,1-Trichloroethane (TCA); tetrachloroethylene (PCE); and breakdown products were also detected. While chromium levels were elevated, they did not constitute a concerning level.

Female: Her lover pursues her (2:8–9) This section starts a poetic exposition of lovers who are joined and separated (–). Verses 8–17 form a unity of a poem of the spring by the woman, beginning with 'the voice of my beloved' ( ; or 'the sound of his [approach]'), which signals his presence before he even speaks.

It was the location of a major open pit mining operation in the 1970s and 1980s. Operations were then suspended for twenty years, but ArcelorMittal resumed extraction in 2006. Location Fire lake is long and wide. It is about north of Port-Cartier, Quebec, a port on the Gulf of Saint Lawrence. It is southeast of Fermont. It is in the unorganized territory of Rivière-Mouchalagane in the Caniapiscau Regional County Municipality. The lake is just west of Quebec Route 389 and the Cartier Railway. Fire Lake was named by the Québec Cartier Mining Company in the 1950s, when that company was prospecting the lake shore. The surrounding land is generally boggy. Lac Bergeron is to the north of Fire Lake, Lac Hope to the east and Lac Hobdad to the west. The region is drained by the Petite rivière Manicouagan. Mining operation The Québec Cartier Mining Company opened the Lake Jeannine iron mine to the southwest of Fire Lake in 1961, near the company built town of Gagnon. The company made investments in the 1970s at Mont-Wright, Fermont and Fire Lake. The open pit mine near Fire Lake was exploited by Sidbec-Normines, a private-public consortium, between 1977 and 1984. Before the work began, in 1971–1977 facilities were built around the hamlet of Fire Lake, and a road was built that connected it to the town of Gagnon, to the southwest. In all 54 million tonnes of iron was extracted from Fire Lake, transported in the form of iron and silica pellets to the Port Cartier plant, then mostly shipped to Europe. The Lake Jeannine iron mine closed in 1976. The Fire Lake mine was closed in 1984. The mill at Lake Jeannine continued to treat iron ore from Fire Lake until 1985. The hamlet of Fire Lake and town of Gagnon were abandoned in 1985. ArcelorMittal resumed mining at Fire Lake in 2006, with operations at first shutting down each winter. In 2012 year-round operations began. The ore is higher-quality than that of the Mont-Wright mine to the north. The site at Fire Lake does not have a crusher or concentrator. Instead, the raw ore in shipped by train to Mont-Wright for processing, typically four times a day in convoys of about 60 wagons. After being crushed and concentrated, the ore is taken by train to Port-Cartier. Fire Lake North, which adjoins the ArcelorMittal property to the north, is operated by Champion Iron. It is estimated to have a total of 3.4 billion tonnes of high quality ore. Fire Lake is one of four operational mines in the Fermont Iron Ore District, which between them account for all of Canada's iron ore production. In 2013 it was estimated that the district produced 47 million tonnes of iron ore concentrate. As of 2017 ArcelorMittal Mining Canada G.P. owned 85% of the Fire Lake mine, while the South Korean POSCO consortium and China Steel owned the remainder. The mine had 66 employees.

The outline of the northern mill can be seen just beyond the two remaining buildings Penmachno quarry around 1875, showing the northern mill The Penmachno quarry (also known as Cwm Machno quarry, Rhiwfachno quarry, or Tan-y-Rhiw quarry) was a slate quarry near Cwm Penmachno, Conwy, North Wales. It was directly below the Rhiwbach Quarry. It was worked between 1818 and 1962.  History  The quarry was originally known as the Tan-y-rhiw quarry, and it was recorded working in 1818. By 1872, the quarry was employing 72 workers, rising to 178 in 1898 at its peak. In 1909, the quarry stopped working for two weeks due to a general depression in the price of slates. In 1937, Penmachno employed 108 quarrymen. It continued working after the Second World War, eventually closing in 1962.  Transport  Unlike most Welsh slate quarries, it had no railway connection to the outside world, and most of the slate it produced was taken by horse-and-cart to a wharf on the River Conwy at Trefriw. In 1868, the LNWR opened their line to Betws-y-Coed and from that date onwards slate could be hauled there, which was still a distance of nearly over rough mountain roads. In the first decade of the 20th century a traction engine was purchased to haul the carts. This arrangement was later replaced by lorries. Some slate was hauled up to Rhiwbach Quarry and taken out to Blaenau Ffestiniog over the Rhiwbach Tramway. There were proposals to link Penmachno and Rhiwbach quarries by tramway, but these proposals were never implemented. Internally, the quarry had a number of gauge tramways and inclines. During the later years of operation a Motor Rail Simplex locomotive was purchased to work the lower tramway. Several proposals were made to connect the quarries by rail.  Geography  The quarry was near the head of the isolated valley of the River Machno, above Penmachno village. Its height on the mountain meant it had a relatively restricted water supply, and on several occasions work stopped due to drought, including in 1891. It was worked as a series of galleried pits, as well as underground chambers. The highest point of the quarry was just above above sea level. The mills level, at the lower end, was at elevation. There were originally two pits, the upper working was known as Rhiw Fachno and the lower one was the main Cwm Machno quarry. Adits lead into the mountain from both pits to access the underground workings. About above the Rhiw Fachno pit was the quarry reservoir.  Geology  The five main veins of Ordovician slate that pass through Blaenau Ffestiniog are the North, Back, Narrow, Main (or Old) and South (or New) veins. As they head eastwards, the lower three thin out and disappear, so that by the time Cwt y Bugail Quarry is reached, only the North Vein and Back Vein are left. Immediately to the east of the Cwt y Bugail main adit, the strata are cut by the Dolwyddelan fault, and the same two veins re-appear at Rhiwbach and Penmachno, some further to the south east, and at a considerably lower altitude. Description  Bardic chair  The chair for the 2019 National Eisteddfod of Wales, held near Llanrwst, was made from slate from Penmachno quarry.

The square is known popularly as \\"Pidgeon Square\\" () due to the heavy presence of pidgeons. It used to be known by different names such as Main Square, Square of France, Square of Victory, Administrative Square, and Lyautey Square.  History  The equestrian statue of Hubert Lyautey, by Antoine Marchisio and François Cogné, was placed in the square in 1938. It still exists, though it was moved within the walls of the French consulate upon Morocco's independence. The area south of the medina that is now Muhammad V Square had been occupied by barracks of the French colonial troops before the plan of Henri Prost and Joseph Marrast to establish a large square there was implemented in 1916. It became the heart of the expanding , or European city. At the time, it was named , Lyautey Square, in honor of the France's first résident général in Morocco. On August 8, 1943, Charles de Gaulle—accompanied by General Georges Catroux, commissary of the Coordination of Muslim Affairs and governor general of Algeria, and Gabriel Puaux, resident general of France in Morocco—appeared at , where he delivered a speech broadcast by radio.  Description  Muhammad V Square in 2012 before renovation works. The square is known popularly as \\"Pidgeon Square\\" because of all the pidgeons. Surrounding the square, buildings for important administrative functions were erected in the Neo-Mauresque style innovated by Henri Prost and his contemporaries. This style combined French design principles with traditional Mauro-Andalusi architectural traditions, which lent the colonial administrative buildings legitimacy. Among the important buildings around the square are: * The Court House (, ) *Wilaya Building (, ) * The Post Office (, ) * Bank al-Maghreb () Nearby: * Arab League Park (formerly \\"Lyautey Park\\") * Church of the Sacred Heart  Access  The square can be accessed from Muhammad V Square Station (, ) on Line 1 of the Casablanca Tramway.

After she filed a complaint with the police she received several frightening texts from a friend of the accused like \\"Don’t do anything you would regret, messing with Notre Dame football is a bad idea.\\" She committed suicide that September, 10 days after making the complaint to the campus police. The Seeberg family has attended either Notre Dame or St. Mary's for 13 generations. Prosecutors did not file criminal charges due to Lizzy not being alive to testify and also because of what they described as inconsistencies in witness accounts and cellphone records. The school determined that Lizzy lied because she said the player stopped attacking her after receiving a call or a text, but phone records showed that it was the accused who called his friend. An expert from the police department told the Washington Post that victims often get some details mixed up because of the way the brain processes information in traumatic situations. Prince Shembo During the 2014 NFL Scouting Combine, Prince Shembo admitted that as a Notre Dame student in 2010, he was accused of sexual battery against Seeberg and said that he is innocent of the accusation. Seeberg's father responded that Notre Dame was negligent in investigating Seeberg's accusation because they were protecting Shembo. Complaint and investigation In her statement to the police Lizzy told them \\"I didn't feel safe in his room....he proceeded to grab my face and started to kiss me. Tears started rolling down my face because I didn't know what to do...I felt so scared, I couldn't move.\\" At that time of her death investigators still had not interviewed the accused, which they did 15 days after she made the complaint. In response to the families complaints about Notre Dame's investigation the university issued a statement saying \\"we have great sympathy for a grieving family that may believe our investigation was insufficient, but we also respectfully and wholeheartedly disagree with that contention.\\" However, the university had investigated Lizzy herself, including speaking with a former roommate at another school that she had previously had some disagreement with. Media At a closed door hearing held after the story made headlines in the national media the accused football player was found \\"not responsible\\" and was not suspended from the team.

She first became famous in 1955 for winning the top prize on the American game show The $64,000 Question. Her fame from the game show allowed her to go on to host various advice columns and television shows, which established her as a pioneer in the field of \\"pop (popular) psychology\\". Brothers is often credited as the first to normalize psychological concepts to the American mainstream. Her syndicated columns were featured in newspapers and magazines, including a monthly column for Good Housekeeping, in which she contributed for nearly 40 years. As Brothers quickly became the \\"face of psychology\\" for American audiences, she often appeared in various television roles, usually as herself. From the 1970s onward, she also began to accept fictional roles that parodied her \\"woman psychologist\\" persona. She is noted for working continuously for five decades across various genres. Numerous groups recognized Brothers for her strong leadership as a woman in the psychological field and for helping to destigmatize the profession overall.  Family and personal relationships  Joyce Diane Brothers was born to Morris K. Bauer and Estelle Rapport, who were attorneys that shared a law practice. She grew up in a Jewish household in Far Rockaway, Queens, New York. Brothers also had a sister named Elaine Goldsmith whom she was close with. Joyce Brothers describes that growing up, her father treated her like the son, even having decided to name her \\"Joseph\\" instead of Joyce before she was born. As a result, Brothers grew up in an environment in which her status as a female made no difference in the family's expectations of high academic excellence for all their children. Consequently, she was often described as being a studious person, thriving on \\"hard work and academic achievement\\". In 1949, Brothers married Milton Brothers who later went on to become an internist. In 1989, Brothers lost her husband due to bladder cancer. Following the death of her husband, Brothers fell into a state of depression for a year, and contemplated suicide; however, she used her work to achieve inner peace and recover. With her husband, she had a daughter. Brothers was also close to her four grandchildren and two great-grandchildren.  Early education  Brothers graduated from Far Rockaway High School in January 1944. Afterwards, she entered Cornell University, double-majoring in home economics and psychology and graduated with honors in 1947. Brothers was a member of Sigma Delta Tau sorority at the time. While working on her graduate studies (from 1948 to 1953) at Columbia University (A.M., 1949; Ph.D., 1953), she was a research assistant at Columbia, an instructor at Hunter College and a research fellow on a UNESCO leadership project from 1949 to 1959. Her doctoral dissertation was titled \\"Anxiety Avoidance and Escape Behaviour as Measured by Action Potential in Muscle\\". The American Association of University Women AAUW awarded Brothers the American Fellowship in 1952, which enabled her to complete the doctoral degree. Career = Licensure as a psychologist = As a psychologist, Brothers had been licensed in New York since 1958. = Television and radio = $64,000 Question (1955) Joyce Brothers' first television appearance was at the age of 28. At that time, her husband was making $50 a month as a medical intern at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York which was not enough to support themselves and their young three- year-old daughter. To escape what Brothers called the \\"slum-like conditions\\" of her New York City walk up, she was driven to enter as a contestant on the game show, The $64,000 Question. The $64,000 Question was one of the top charting shows of the time and possessed the largest jackpot of all the current quiz shows. To become a contestant, Brothers had to write a letter stating a description of herself, the hobbies she immersed herself in, why she would make a great contestant and what she would do if she were to carry forth with the winnings. Eventually, the letter landed her an interview with Mert Koplin, the show's producer. While in her letter she discussed her qualifications in the field of psychology and home economics she was not allowed to use her expert knowledge for the show as The $64,000 Question did not allow participants to be quizzed on topics of their expertise or profession. As such, Brothers had to come up with a new topic area for her to be quizzed on for the show. With the gender roles of the time in mind, Koplin thought he could draw in the most viewership by juxtaposing Brother's perceived frailty as a woman with the idea that she knew a great deal about a more masculine field. He is credited with saying Brothers should be given a topic on \\"something that [she] shouldn't know about... [something like] if it were football or if it were horse racing or boxing...\\" Brothers' husband was a great fan of boxing, so she decided to go with the topic of boxing for the show. Memorizing twenty-volume boxing encyclopedias, many years worth of Ring Magazine issues, alongside working with the writer Nat Fleischer. She also had the opportunity to be coached by former Olympic boxing champion and New York State Athletic Commissioner Edward P.F Egan. After studying, she progressed on the show for several weeks. Despite efforts to stump her at the $16,000 mark by asking questions involving referees rather than the boxers themselves, she exceeded expectations and won the top prize. Brothers used her photographic memory and focus to learn everything she could, and quickly became regarded as an expert in the subject area of boxing. Her success on The $64,000 Question earned Brothers a chance to be the color commentator for CBS during the boxing match between Carmen Basilio and Sugar Ray Robinson. She was said to have been the first female boxing commentator. Two years later, Brothers appeared on a spin-off series of The $64,000 Challenge, which brought in the winners of The $64,000 Question and matched them against experts in the field. Again, Brothers walked off with the maximum prize, winning against seven other competitors. While The $64,000 Question and The $64,000 Challenge later came out with cheating scandals of some contestants only pretending to be novices to their respective topic, Brothers was one of the contestants who was cleared of cheating allegations. Sports Showcase (1956) After the success of the quiz show, Brothers co-hosted the Sports Showcase with journalist Max Kase. This made her one of the first female sports commentators.  Local afternoon show on NBC’s WRCA-TV  Brothers' wish to use her platform to practice psychology was provided through reading letters from people that submitted it to the radio. This opportunity was provided on a four-week basis on NBC's WRCA-TV.  Appearances on talk shows  Brothers appeared on The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson as a means for the public to get to know her more than the advice columns. With more than ninety appearances on the show, she provided detailed psychological updates on the accounts of the current social climate of that time. She also appeared on daytime television programs like Good Morning America, Today, Entertainment Tonight, and CNN as well as late-night television shows with Merv Griffin, Mike Douglas, and Conan O’Brien, amongst many others, including The Steve Allen Show and The Dick Cavett Show.  Living Easy with Dr. Joyce Brothers, her own Talk Show (1973)  In efforts to market and promote their new textile fibre Trevira polyester, the German chemical company Hoechst provided Joyce Brothers with her own show. While Brothers had the opportunity to host her own show and allow the public to learn more about her, the show's ultimate function was to promote Trevira and the company's latest fashions. This was evident in almost every aspect of the show, from when Brothers would casually segue her discussions onto the topic of fashion, to the very set itself which was decorated entirely in the Trevira fabric. Initially the show was located in the Broadway Theatre District in New York but by its second year it moved to Studio 6B at 30 Rockefeller Centre. The show, titled Living Easy with Dr. Joyce Brothers, consisted of things like guest interviews, musical performances, how-to-demos and a weekly segment dedicated to psychology. For three years the show ran 200 shows, across 150 stations. Despite its run of three years, the show did face criticisms from stakeholders and the public who believed there was not enough focus on psychology and that Brothers was failing to adequately incorporate her psychological expertise.  Dr. Joyce Brothers Show (1985)  Brothers in 1988 A decade after Living Easy with Dr. Joyce Brothers , Brothers premiered a new show. It consisted of 16 one-hour weekly installments on the Disney Channel. This would be her first appearance on cable television. The themes surrounding the show were family oriented, with each show consisting of a comedian and a special guest star, and calls from viewers to provide advice from a psychological and educational standpoint. By August 1985, Brothers was given her own television show on a New York station, but her topic was not sports; she began doing an advice show about relationships, during which she answered questions from the audience. Sponsors were nervous about whether a television psychologist could succeed, she recalled, but viewers expressed their gratitude for her show, telling her she was giving them the information they could not get elsewhere. Joyce Brothers covered a variety of topics, including: prognosis for American football, the psychology of football, women's changing clothing styles, HIV and AIDS, school shootings, and more. In essence, Brothers brought psychology to the mainstream media. Brothers presented syndicated advice shows on both television and radio, during a broadcasting career that lasted more than four decades. Her shows changed names numerous times, from The Dr. Joyce Brothers Show to Consult Dr. Brothers to Tell Me, Dr. Brothers to Ask Dr. Brothers to Living Easy with Dr. Joyce Brothers. In 1964, she interviewed and posed for publicity photographs with the Beatles on their first visit to the United States.  Cameo appearances  Brothers made cameo appearances as herself in the comedy series Police Squad! and its first spinoff film Naked Gun. = Newspaper and books = Brothers also had a monthly column in Good Housekeeping for almost four decades and a syndicated newspaper column that she began writing in the 1970s, which at its height was printed in more than 300 newspapers. She also published several books including the 1981 book, What Every Woman Should Know About Men, and the 1991 book, Widowed, inspired by the loss of her husband. Her advice was also used as a source for some questions on the 1998–2004 incarnation of Hollywood Squares. Joyce Brothers conducted self promotion and was seemingly skilled in navigating the male-dominated media industry. In addition to her television and radio presence, Brothers wrote best-selling books; these books included advice on how to achieve a successful marriage and career.  Impact  =Social conversation= She was viewed as the public crisis counselor, as she was asked to comment on issues like Princess Diana's death and the explosion of the Challenger space shuttle. Joyce Brothers addressed homosexuality in 1972, and the transgender community in 1959, easing her viewers into it from the prior standpoint in which they were raised with. After the 1999 Columbine school shooting, she was persistent on CNN, for gun control legislation. More memorable episodes of her advice shows include when she helped a man on air who called in contemplating suicide as a result of being blind in one eye and nearly blind in the other. Her efforts included keeping him on air for thirty minutes--long enough for National Save-A-Life to contact. Another similar episode aired in 1971 when a woman called in and was threatening to overdose on sleeping pills. As this was a riveting circumstance, the show was left running for 3 more hours after uninterrupted, so that Brothers was able to extract a phone number from the woman to get an ambulance to her. =Sexism= Upon receiving acceptance into Columbia University for her Ph.D, the dean of her department, stated although her qualifications were impeccable, she was taking the position of a man who would use the degree, and it would be best if she dropped her position. However, Brothers did not waver and maintained her position. Despite this, she was a product of the time evidenced by her belief that her husband should be the breadwinner. She thus gave up any notion of pursuing a career in psychology for herself, as it could mean being in competition with her husband. Early in her career, when Brothers was asked by women for advice on when their husband would show interest in other women, Brothers was known to ask the caller to look at themselves and ask what they could do to be more like the women their husband seem to chase after. Brothers later became more involved with issues of women's rights. In 1972, she was one of many who testified in front of the platform committee on women's issues, also serving as acting chair of a US delegation for the 16th assembly of the Inter-American Commission of Women. In 1979, she provided proposals at the congressional hearing on \\"problems of mid-life women\\", speaking on employment, retirement income, and anti-ageism in television characters.  Criticism, positive contributions, and awards  = Controversy surrounding Brothers’ \\"Pop Psychology\\" = Increasing in fame, there was also a growth in disapproving psychologists and psychiatrists who questioned the validity of her psychological claims and her authority to be providing psychological advice. A growing number of psychologists began to believe the advice she provided for her audience appeared was unethical as she did not hold any clinical degree and the advice she was giving to was for strangers, not patients she had a professional relationship with. Criticism by Stevens and Gardener, the authors of “Women of Psychology” stated as “traditional psychologists smile subtly when her name is mentioned and they often complain that she actually does more damage than good\\". There were many efforts from some American Psychological Association members to revoke Brothers’ membership, as her advice was provided in a bad form. Although it never came to this, Joyce Brothers did cause some uproar in the community. = De-stigmatizing psychology = Despite the criticism, at the end of one of her TV appearance in December 1958, Roger Turtle and Joyce Brothers discussed the logistics behind the process of her TV appearances. There were 15 hours spent preparing for each show, with consultations with other professionals and the breakdown of the grand field of psychology to be understood in terms of everyday language. All this occurring behind the scenes, during the actual shows there were many references to scientific research and explicit statements that psychology is a service not simply a source of entertainment. These shows provided a platform to \\"professionalize and de-stigmatize psychology\\". Mental health was very stigmatized and not as covered in the media, but Joyce Brothers strived to contribute significantly to giving people a different perspective. Her show allowed the public to view psychologists as real people. With an influx of letters from those that wanted advice from several topics like: marriage, parenting, work, money also other taboo topics like menopause, infidelity and sex. Her light on these topics assisted in normalizing these within the mainstream media, with an explicit importance on therapy for everyday life and not only those with mental illness stated. = Honors and awards = Brothers was also recognized with the following honors and awards: Women of Achievement Award, Federation of Jewish Women (1964); Professional Woman of the Year, Business and Professional Women's Club (1968); Award of the Parkinson Disease Foundation. Brothers was also recognized not just by awards, but also in many different areas, Brothers was given an honorary degree, the L.H.D. which as from Franklin Pierce college in 1969.  Death and legacy  Brothers died on May 13, 2013 at her home in Fort Lee, New Jersey. Her daughter, Lisa Brothers Arbisser, says she died of respiratory failure.

Background  During the government of Juscelino Kubitscheck, a politic of Developmentalism were adopted, through the construction of Brasilia, under the promise of development of the national industry upon 5 years.  Main tenets  Janismo can be defined by this electoral campaign and government under Jânio Quadros's presidency. Janismo focused in combat corruption as the main goal; it is characterized by a Right- wing populism, but, in opposition to Getulismo and Peronism; the main difference between Jânio and Vargas, was in the way that they targeted the lower class: while Vargas appeal for best conditions for the labour class, Jânio atractted attention from the same class, by a justice-seeking sentiment. Other characteristics of Janismo were perceived: * Anti-communism and Right- wing populism. * Non-alignment. Jânio refused to follow a solid alliance with his political coalition; Jânio kept relations with eastern-bloc countries, despite the conservative ideology of his party; he also appointed ministers that were rivals of his political base in Brazilian Congress. * Anti- parliamentarism: Since Jânio lost the support of Congress, he made a letter for the population, declaring that the parliament, was dominated by political elites that tried to boycott his government. Jânio hoped to govern with popular support above the will of the legislative branch. * Anti-corruption propaganda during electoral campaign. * Anti-Getulism. Appeal for the labour class in a different way. * Non-partisan politics: Jânio never have kept compromise with any party, but \\"only with the masses\\" who should trust in his leadership. According to historians Lilia Schwarcz and Heloísa Starling, Jânio made clear he was above all parties and traditional politicians.SCHWARCZ, Lilia Moritz e STARLING, Heloísa Murgel.

Jan–Jan Movement  During 1960 Brazilian presidential election, not satisfied with the candidacy of Henrique Teixeira Lott (supported by the main labourist party, the Brazilian Labour Party), syndicalists supported Jânio Quadros candidacy as president, and João \\"Jango\\" Goulart, his rival, as vice-president. This non-formal coalition, was named \\"Jan–Jan Movement\\". By the first time in decades, a vice-president was elected as opposition of the president (Goulart was an ally of his main rival: Kubitschek).
