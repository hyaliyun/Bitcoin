He gained notoriety following the publication of his 1989 account of the failed drug run and subsequent execution of Australian drug runners, Kevin Barlow and Geoffrey Chambers. Titled This Little Piggy Stayed Home: Barlow, Chambers and the Mafia the book was one of the more controversial publications of Panorama Books. The book was never printed again following its initial release, despite continued demand, because of fears of litigation. It caused a stir in the large Italian community based in Western Australia and, for a time, was roundly rejected as an accurate account of the mafia's existence and operation in WA. That changed when famed mafia hunter, Judge Giovanni Falcone, used Williams' book to describe the formation of the mafia in the state around cells of influence. Falcone was assassinated on 23 May 1992, in a massive car bomb attack ‚Äì not six months following his vindication of Williams' work. Williams took an extended break from journalism after reporting on the deaths of nine people in the Gracetown cliff collapse in 1996. Gracetown is a small coastal community on the south-west coast of Western Australia, near Margaret River. His piece was the only eyewitness journalistic account of the events following the tragedy, but it was his own involvement in the community effort to recover the bodies from beneath the sand that led to his disenchantment with media. Williams pursued theological studies for some years and eventually earned a PhD. He took up an academic role at Laidlaw College, in Auckland, New Zealand, where he designed a new counselling degree programme. He left the college after some years and launched his own news magazine. Williams continues to author books and consults in the areas of communication, human relationships, epistemology and theology, through his consultancy Other Wise. His latest book is on the life and death of Dr Jared Noel, a young Auckland City Hospital surgeon who succumbed to bowel cancer in October 2014. In the five or so years that Jared fought the disease, he wrote a blog about his journey of suffering, faith and hope, which garnered a large following. Williams interviewed Jared almost daily in the final month leading up to his death, and Message to My Girl, told in Jared's voice and from his perspective, is a reflection on a young person's submission to mortality, and an inspirational account of how to approach death with unending hope.

The masks are used in healing rituals which invoke the spirit of an old hunch-backed man. Those cured by the society become members. Also, echoing the significance of dreams to the Iroquois, anyone who dreams that they should be a member of the society may join. In modern times, the masks have been a contentious subject among the Iroquois. Some Iroquois who are not members of the False Face Society have produced and sold the masks to non-Native tourists and collectors. The Iroquois leadership responded to the commercialization of this tradition and released a statement against the sale of these sacred masks. They also called for the return of the masks from collectors and museums. Iroquois traditionalists object to labeling the masks as simply \\"artifacts\\" since they are not conceived as objects but the living representation of a spirit.  Traditional Origin Story from Six Nations  False Face in the Ethnological Museum in Berlin As described in, for example, Fenton (1987), the Creator (Shonkwaia'tison in Cayuga, lit. 'he has completed our bodies'), having just completed forming the earth and what was on it, was walking around admiring his handiwork when he noticed what appeared to be another man in the distance, walking toward him. They soon met, and Shonkwaia'tison asked the stranger where he had come from. The stranger replied, \\"I believe that I am the creator of this land, and I am walking around now admiring what I have done.\\" Surprised, Shonkwaia'tison said, \\"No, you are wrong. It was I who created this land.\\" They bickered back and forth like this for a little while, until finally Shonkwaia'tison said, \\"Fine then, let us have a test to see who actually did create this land.\\" He pointed to a mountain in the distance. \\"See that mountain?\\" he said. \\"We will use our power to move it. The one who moves it the farthest must have the most power, and must therefore also be the creator of this land.\\" The stranger agreed to this challenge, and added his own rule: \\"We will turn our backs,\\" he said, \\"and when one's turn is up we will turn back around to see how far the mountain has moved.\\" Shonkwaia'tison agreed to this, and so they turned. The stranger went first. When he was satisfied that he had moved the mountain, they turned back around. Shonkwaia'tison was surprised to see that the mountain had indeed moved, although only a little bit. \\"Now it's my turn,\\" Shonkwaia'tison said, and they turned their backs on the mountain once more. There was a commotion and noise behind them, and, out of curiosity, the stranger turned back around before they had agreed to it. Little did he know that Shonkwaia'tison had moved the mountain so close to the stranger's back that when he turned to look he struck his face on it. The force of the impact bent his nose and left one side of his face crooked. At this, the stranger conceded that Shonkwaia'tison was the more powerful of the two, and that he must also be the creator of the land and everything on it. Shonkwaia'tison then had to decide what to do about the stranger. Because he had moved the mountain (if only a little bit), the stranger indeed was possessed of a certain degree of power, and Shonkwaia'tison thought that it would not do to let such a being remain on the earth; he was about to populate the earth with people, and to let this stranger coexist with them might not be a good thing. He told the stranger so, and proposed that he would have to remove him from the land. The stranger pleaded with Shonkwaia'tison and said that, if he was allowed to stay, he would help the people who Shonkwaia'tison was about to make. \\"This is what I will do,\\" the stranger said. \\"I have the power to control the wind, and I can protect the people in this way. If ever a strong wind or storm threatens them, I will use my cane and block it from destroying their settlements, and I can lift it and send it over their settlements so that it does not blow through. In addition to this, I have the power to heal sickness. If ever the people are struck down with illness they can call on me, and I will help them to get better. This is how they will do it. When they need aid of me in this way, they will create a mask whose face is in my image, and I will hand-pick the men who will create these masks. The very second that they lay the first strike in creating a mask, that fast will it have my power. When they use the mask they will prepare a certain kind of corn mush, and burn tobacco. The tobacco will form their words which I will hear, and I will come. They will refer to me as their grandfather, and I will help them as long as the earth remains.\\" Shonkwaia'tison agreed to this, and allowed the stranger to stay on the earth. Traditional Origin Story from Onondaga Nation Iroquois oral history tells the beginning of the False Face tradition. According to the accounts, the Creator Sh√∂√±gwaia'dihsum ('our creator' in Onondaga), blessed with healing powers in response to his love of living things, encountered a stranger, referred to in Onondaga as Ethiso:da' ('our grandfather') or Hado'ih (), and challenged him in a competition to see who could move a mountain. Ethiso:da' managed to make the mountain quake and move but a small amount. Sh√∂√±gwaia'dihsa'ih declared that Ethiso:da' had power but not enough to move the mountain significantly. He proceeded to move the mountain, telling Ethiso:da' not to look behind him. Turning his head quickly out of curiosity, the mountain struck the stranger in the face and left his face disfigured. Sh√∂√±gwaia'dihsum then employed Ethiso:da' to protect his children from disease and sickness. But knowing the sight of Ethiso:da' was not suitable for his children's eyes, Sh√∂√±gwaia‚Äôdihsum banished him to live in caves and great wooded forests, only to leave when called upon to cure or interact through dreams. Hado'ih then became a great healer, also known as \\"Old Broken Nose\\". False Face Tradition Today To this day, the Iroquois believe that the being protects them in times of need, redirecting fierce winds that threaten them and healing those who are ill. Various names are used to refer to this being among the Iroquois communities. Etihs√≥:t Had√∫‚Å∑i‚Å∑ (lit. 'our grandfather, he who drives it away') is used in Cayuga. Gag√∂hsa' (lit. 'a face') or Sagojow√©hgowa: (lit. 'he defends or protects them; the Great Defender') in Seneca. Ethiso:da' (lit. 'our grandfather') in Onondaga. In English, he is most often referred to as simply false face.  Masks  The design of the masks is somewhat variable, but most share certain features. The eyes are deep-set and accented by metal. The noses are bent and crooked. The other facial features are variable. The masks are painted red and black. Most often they have pouches of tobacco tied onto the hair above their foreheads. Basswood is usually used for the masks although other types of wood are sometimes used. Horse tail hair is used for the hair, which can be black, reddish brown, brown, grey or white. Before the introduction of horses by the Europeans, corn husks and buffalo hair were used. When making a mask, a man walks through the woods until he is moved by Had√∫‚Å∑i‚Å∑ to carve a mask from a tree. Had√∫‚Å∑i‚Å∑ inspires the unique elements of the mask's design and the resulting product represents the spirit himself, imbued with his powers. The masks are carved directly on the tree and only removed when completed. Masks are painted red if they were begun in the morning or black if they were begun in the afternoon. Because the masks are carved into trees that are alive, they are similarly considered to be living and breathing. They are served parched whitecorn mush and given small pouches of tobacco as payment for services.  Ritual  False Face leader rubbing his rattle on a stump The False Face Society proper performs a ritual twice a year. The ceremony contains a telling of the False Face myth, an invocation to the spirits using tobacco, the main False Face ritual, and a doling out of mush at the end. During the main part of the ritual, the False Face members, wearing masks, go through houses in the community, driving away sickness, disease and evil spirits. The False Face members use turtle shell rattles, shaking them and rubbing them along the floors and walls. The arrival of the False Faces is heralded by another medicine society that uses masks made of corn husk. If a sick person is found, a healing ritual may be performed using tobacco and singing. The tobacco is burned, and wood ashes are blown over the sick person. The community then gathers at the longhouse where the False Faces enter and sit on the floor. The people bring tobacco which is collected as they arrive, and burned when the ceremony begins. The ceremony itself is meant to renew and restrengthen the power of the gathered masks, as well as the spirit of Hadu‚Å∑i‚Å∑ in general. The ritual continues with dancing. At the end of the ritual, corn mush is doled out to the assembled crowd, and everyone goes home. The ritual is performed during the spring and fall. Other, smaller versions occur during the Midwinter Festival, and at an individual's home as requested.  Modern conflicts  The Iroquois Traditionalist Society has opposed the sale of False Face masks to private collectors and museums. The Society is very sacred and not to be shared, in any form, with those who do not belong to either the society itself or the nation, whose members are sometimes involved in the curing rites without belonging to the society. Traditionalists insist that schools should not imitate the faces for projects. It is seen as a sign of disrespect to the Iroquois people and the False Face spirit. Many Iroquois also campaign to regain possession of masks that remain with private collectors or museums. Several Iroquois governments have pushed for the return of masks to the communities from which they came. The National Museum of the American Indian in Washington D.C. has returned many items of significant importance, including masks, and is still in the process of returning others. The Onondaga Chief Tadadaho issued a statement online in 1995 about the Haudenosaunee policies regarding masks. These policies prohibit the sale, exhibition or representation in pictures of the masks to the public. They also condemn the general distribution of information regarding the medicine societies, as well as denying non-Indigenous People any right to examine, interpret, or present the beliefs, functions, or duties of these societies.

The Illinois Prairie Path (often called the Prairie Path and abbreviated IPP) is a network of of bicycle trails, mostly in DuPage County, Illinois. Portions of the trail extend west to Kane County and east to Cook County. Most of the trail is categorized as rail-to-trail, meaning that the bicycle path is built atop an old railroad right of way. In the case of the Prairie Path, the vast majority of its routing runs on the former right-of-way of the Chicago Aurora and Elgin Railroad. The 1963 letter from May Theilgaard Watts that led to formation of this trail is widely regarded as the first proposal in America that eventually led to widespread the rail-to-trails land use. In August 2008, it was inducted into the Rails-to Trails hall of fame. Routing 2-mile marker of the Aurora Branch of the Illinois Prairie Path in Wheaton, Illinois. The Illinois Prairie Path consists of three distinct branches originating from a point just west of downtown Wheaton (). The northwest branch is called the Elgin Branch and runs approximately to Elgin, where it intersects with the Fox River Trail ). This branch is the longest of the three. The southwest branch is called the Aurora Branch and runs approximately to RiverEdge Park in Aurora, where it, too, intersects with the Fox River Trail (). The eastern branch is known as the Main Stem and runs east to Forest Park at the Forest Park CTA station, where it crosses the historic Elmhurst Great Western Prairie ). All three branches are marked with concrete mile markers stating the name of the branch, and how many miles away from Wheaton the rider currently is, although the frequency and character of these markers varies from county to county. After its conception, spurs were added to the system extending west from the Elgin Branch to Geneva (known as the Geneva Spur) and west from the Aurora Branch to Batavia (known as the Batavia Spur). These spur branches are 6 and 5 miles (10 and 9 km) long respectively, and are also marked with mile markers. The Prairie Path itself is part of a larger regional network of trails in the Chicago metropolitan area. The Elgin Branch and Main Stem are part of the long Grand Illinois Trail in north- central Illinois. On a more local level, the Prairie Path intersects with Kane County's Fox River Trail four times, and the Great Western Trail -- a parallel connector between the Main Stem at Lombard and the Elgin Branch. There will also be future connections to the West Branch DuPage River Trail, the East Branch DuPage River Trail, and the Salt Creek Trail. The DuPage County Department of Transportation maintains internal designations for the Illinois Prairie Path as a part of the county's highway system. County Highway 47 refers to the Main Stem and the Aurora Branch. County Highway 48 refers to the Elgin Branch. County Highway 49 refers to the Batavia Spur, while County Highway 57 refers to the Geneva Spur.  History  The concept of a regional trail in DuPage County was introduced in 1963 by May Theilgaard Watts, a leading figure at the Morton Arboretum. In a letter to the editor of the Chicago Tribune, she called for the Chicago, Aurora and Elgin Electric Railroad right of way to be preserved for future generations instead of being given over to development. After eight years of contentious meetings between Watts and her representatives, and those of the towns of Wheaton and Glen Ellyn (who sought the right-of-way as valuable parking space), U.S. Secretary of the Interior Rogers C.B. Morton designated the Illinois Prairie Path as the second of 27 new National Trails. In the designation, Mrs. Watts was honored \\"for her outstanding efforts toward establishment of the Illinois Prairie Path.\\" Although the IPP was the first Rail Trail proposed in the US, the Elroy-Sparta State Trail in Wisconsin was completed and opened first. On August 23, 2006, a new pedestrian bridge was lifted into place over the Des Plaines River between Maywood and Forest Park. The bridge and new approaches permit a direct crossing over the Des Plaines River, allowing the main stem of the Prairie Path to terminate further east, at the Forest Park CTA station. The bridge and approaches opened in late October 2006, after lighting and emergency call boxes were installed. In 2014, North Central College became the home to the Prairie Path's official archives.

An experienced aviator, he is sometimes credited with being the first to use the kamikaze attack, although official accounts may have been invented for propaganda purposes. Arima personally led an air attack against United States Navy Task Force 38 in the Formosa Air Battle and was killed in action. Biography Arima was born in Ijuin village (present day Hioki city), Kagoshima prefecture. He graduated from the 43rd class of the Imperial Japanese Naval Academy in 1915. He was ranked 33rd in a class of 96 cadets. As a midshipman, he was assigned to the cruiser on its 1915 long distance navigational training voyage from Sasebo to Chemulpo, Dairen, Chinkai, Maizuru and Toba. He stayed with Iwate on its cruise the following year to Hong Kong, Singapore, Fremantle, Melbourne, Sydney, Wellington, Auckland, Jaluit Atoll, Ponape, and Truk. On his return, he was commissioned as an ensign assigned to the battleship . As a lieutenant, he subsequently served on the destroyer , battleship and , destroyer , cruiser , and battleship . He returned to school, graduating from the 26th class of Naval War College (Japan) in 1928 and was promoted to lieutenant commander. After serving as chief gunnery officer on the battleship and the cruiser , Arima received his first command on 1 December 1937, the converted seaplane tender . He was also promoted to captain the same day. Arima oversaw several naval air force bases in Japan from 1938‚Äì1942, and was then posted as captain of the aircraft carrier on 25 May 1942. While on Sh≈çkaku, he was in the Guadalcanal campaign, the Battle of the Eastern Solomons, the Battle of the Santa Cruz Islands, and the Naval Battle of Guadalcanal. (left) and Franklin hit by kamikazes, 30 October 1944 Arima was promoted to rear admiral on 1 May 1943. He was given a combat command on 9 April 1944, and was assigned the 26th Air Flotilla, based at Clark Air Base, on Luzon, in the Philippines. After the Battle of Leyte Gulf, at some date between 13 October and 26 October (accounts vary), Arima personally led an air attack against U.S. Navy Task Force 38 in the Aerial Battle of Taiwan-Okinawa. Before taking off in a Mitsubishi G4M \\"Betty\\" twin-engine bomber, he allegedly removed his rank and other insignia, and declared his intention to not return alive. Although Arima indeed did not return, and some damage was caused to the Essex-class aircraft carrier , it is not clear that the damage was from a planned suicide attack, and some accounts state that none of Arima's formation reached their targets. Another source claims that the first kamikaze attack happened a month earlier. On 12 September 1944, a group of Army pilots of the 31st Fighter Squadron located on Negros Island decided to launch a suicide attack the following morning. First Lieutenant Takeshi Kosai and another sergeant were selected. Strapping two bombs onto two fighters, they took off on 13 September before dawn, determined to crash into aircraft carriers. They never returned, but there is no record of an enemy plane hitting an American ship on that day.John Toland, The Rising Sun: The Decline and Fall of the Japanese Empire 1936-1945 p.568 In the aftermath of the battle, however, Arima was officially credited by the Imperial Japanese Navy with introducing the use of the kamikaze attack, and he was publicized as a hero in the government- controlled Japanese press. Arima was posthumously promoted to vice admiral. His cenotaph is at the temple of Kozai-ji in his home town of Hioki, Kagoshima.

In addition to being found in Italy and England, it is also found in Germany, is common in Malta, and can be found among Italian and British immigrants in the United States and other countries. Families called Pace have been prominent in Malta and in Sicily and held feudal estates in both of these areas. The pronunciation varies according to a family's origins and linguistic heritage, but the two most commonly used are the English \\"Pace\\", rhyming with \\"race\\", and the Italian \\"PAH-chay\\". Origin There are at least two independent origins of the name Pace, one in Italy and the other in England, but in both cases it is believed to be of Latin origins. Most people called Pace in Malta have an origin in speakers of Italian, while most Paces in Germany are probably connected with someone of the name who originated in England. In England the spelling of the name has many variant spellings, including Peace, Paice, Pase, Payce, and others. The surname dates back to the early 13th century and early examples of the recordings include Roger Pays in the 1275 Hundred Rolls of Norfolk, William Pace in 1242 in the Book of Fees for Devon, and Peter Pece of Yorkshire in 1302. Examples from parish registers include the marriage of Alice Pace to Thomas Picket in 1539 at St. Michael Bassishaw, and Alyse Paice who married John Garrot on August 16, 1573 at the church of St. Lawrence Pountney, both in the City of London. As a name in England, Pace has at least two possible origins. The first is from an early medieval nickname for a mild-mannered and even-tempered man, derived from the Anglo-Norman-French and Middle English word \\"pace\\" or \\"pece\\", ultimately from the Latin \\"pax\\" or \\"pacis\\", meaning \\"peace\\". The second possible origin is from the result of confusion with the personal name \\"Pash\\" or \\"Pask(e)\\", used frequently in medieval England as both a Christian name and as a nickname for a person born at Easter, or one having some other connection with that festival, such as a feudal obligation to provide a service, or make a payment, on that date. It has also been argued that Pace is an unusual surname of French origins, and the first recorded spelling of the family name is shown to be that of John Pais, which was dated 1219, in the \\"Register of the Freemen of Leicester\\", during the reign of King Henry III, known as \\"The Frenchman\\", 1216‚Äì1272. Surnames became necessary when governments introduced personal taxation. In England this was known as Poll Tax. Throughout the centuries, surnames in every country have continued to change creating variants of the original spelling.Pace at surnamedb.com Italy The Italian surnames shares the same Latin root, the word for peace, pax. Specifically, \\"pace\\" is the ablative declension of \\"pax\\" in Latin, which in Classical Latin was probably pronounced \\"PAH-kay\\". The word sees popular usage in Ecclesiastical Latin, which today as in the Middle Ages pronounces it in the Italian manner. \\"Pace\\" remains the word for \\"peace\\" in Modern Italian. The Italian Pace is believed to be a patronymic, meaning that those with the surname are the descendants of a man with a first name of Pace (from Latin Pax, Pacis). Early bearers of this surname might have been bestowed with it because of their calm or reputation as peacemakers, or to those who spread peace in a religious sense. The first references to the surname Pace occur in the 6th and 7th centuries in the forms of Pace, Pacius, Pacinus, and Pax. An Italian line of Pace was ennobled in the Holy Roman Empire as Pace von Friedensberg in the seventeenth century. Today the surname Pace is concentrated in various regions of Italy and is found all over Italy, especially in northern Piemonte and Lombardy, in central Latium and Abruzzo, and in southern Sicily, Calabria, Apulia, and Basilicata. In certain places like Pratola Peligna in L'Aquila, Abruzzo, virtually everyone has a relative with the surname Pace and it can take up pages in the phonebook. The Maltese line of the name comes thanks to the strong Italian influence on that nation. Especially important was the period after October 5, 1350, when Malta was incorporated directly under the Kingdom of Sicily, expanding the number of greatly in Malta. In Malta, the surname is sometimes pronounced as in Italian but other times an abridged form, \\"PAH-ch\\", is used. England Pace eggs The Dictionary of English SurnamesReaney & Wilson, Oxford, 1995 gives the origin of the English surname \\"Pace\\" as ME pais, OFr pais, Lat pax, \\"peace, concord, amity\\", and adds: \\"As ME pasches appears also as paisch, piece, peace, and Easter eggs are still called Pace eggs.\\" The area of greatest concentration is Wolverhampton. The surname \\"Pacey\\", may derive from the French village of Pacy sur Eure (again probably from Latin Pax, pacis). It is profiled separately from the surname \\"Pace\\", and is ranked 3578 for frequency. Newbold Pacey, a village in Warwickshire, existed as Newbold at the time of the Domesday Book and according to the Victoria County History latet \\"took its name from \\"the family of Pascy, or Pacey\\".'Parishes: Newbold Pacey', A History of the County of Warwick: Volume 5: Kington hundred (1949), pp 122-124, accessed 19 June 2011. The two surnames have historically been sometimes confused. The surname of Richard Pace, the 16th-century churchman, is today pronounced as \\"Pace\\", but his biographer Jervis Wegg states that his surname at the time was spoken as two syllables.Wegg, Richard Pace: A Tudor Diplomatist, Methuen, 1932, p1 Notable people=Brazil *Jos√© Carlos Pace (19441977), Brazilian Formula One racing driver Canada *Kate Pace (born 1969), Canadian Olympic and World Champion alpine skier Italy *Camillo Pace (18621948), Italian Protestant pastor and evangelist who supported the German Protestant anti-Nazi movement in the 1930s *Giulio Pace (15501635), Italian Aristotelian scholar and jurist *Joseph Pace (born 1959), Italian painter and sculptor *Tommaso Pace, Italian diplomat and writer, born in San Costantino Albanese and active in the 19th century *The Pace family of Udine were ennobled in 1658, receiving the title of count Malta *Carmelo Pace (19061993), Maltese composer and professor of music theory and harmony *Claudette Pace (born 1968), Maltese member of parliament and singer *Jamie Pace (born 1977}, English-born Maltese international footballer *Laurie Pace (born 1966), Maltese judo player who represented her country at the 1992, 1996 and 2000 Summer Olympics *Michela Pace (born 2001), Maltese singer who represented Malta in the Eurovision Song Contest 2019 South Africa *Carle Pace (19182008), South African cyclist, track sprinter and endurance athlete United Kingdom *Derek Pace (19321989), English professional footballer *George Pace (19151975), English architect who specialised in ecclesiastical works *Ian Pace (born 1968), English classical pianist *John Pace (), English jester to Henry VIII, to the Duke of Norfolk, and at the court of Elizabeth I *Norman Pace (born 1953), English actor and comedian, best known as one half of the comedy duo Hale and Pace * Richard Pace (disambiguation), multiple people United States *Anne Marie Pace (born 1965), American author *Calvin Pace (born 1980), American football player *Charles Henry Pace (18861963), American composer and publisher (both as sheet music and as recordings) of Christian songs *Darrell Pace (born 1956), American archer who won individual titles at the World Championships and at the Summer Olympics *Dinah Watts Pace (18531933), African-American educator *Frank Pace, Jr. (19121988), American businessman and Secretary of the Army *Harry Pace (Harry Herbert Pace, 18841943), African-American music publisher and insurance executive, and founder of Black Swan Records *Homer Pace (18791942), American business educator and innovator in the field of accountancy who, jointly with his brother Charles Ashford Pace, founded Pace University in New York state *Lee Pace (born 1979), American actor * Norman R.

Supreme Court Official portraits of CJ Artemio Panganiban and Reynato S. Puno in the new SC building. Panganiban was named as Associate Justice of the Supreme Court in 1995. Justice Panganiban was the chairperson of the Supreme Court Third Division and the House of Representatives Electoral Tribunal (HRET), as well as of seven SC committees involved mainly in judicial reforms. Described by a colleague (Justice Antonio T. Carpio) as ‚Äúundoubtedly the most prolific writer of the Court, bar none‚Äù he has during the last ten years penned more than 1,000 full-length decisions and ten books plus several thousand minute resolutions disposing of controversies. These include the Cocofed case, in which the court gave the Presidential Commission on Good Government the right to vote sequestered United Coconut Planters Bank shares, which had been acquired through coco levy funds. =2001 EDSA revolution= Panganiban was also known for his controversial role in helping install then Vice President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo as President in 2001 after the downfall of Joseph Estrada. In his book \\"Reforming the Judiciary,\\" Panganiban recounted that on the morning of January 20, 2001, militants had threatened to march toward Don Chino Roces (Mendiola) Bridge, where Estrada supporters were encamped, unless he resigned. Chaos could have ensued, especially because the government machinery had fallen down, Panganiban said in his book. He also worried that the Vice President could not act because Estrada was still the legal leader. On the other hand, a coup d'√©tat might be staged, and that could obliterate the Constitution. These led Panganiban to conclude that \\"the only way to avert violence, chaos and bloodshed and to save our democratic system from collapse was to have Mrs. Arroyo sworn in as Acting President.\\" He added: \\"After prayer and reflection, I summoned the courage to call up Chief Justice Hilario Davide Jr. about 5:30 a.m. to explain to him my apprehensions. I proposed that, to save the Constitution, he should swear in GMA (Arroyo) by 12 noon of that day.\\" Arroyo became President that day. When the question of Arroyo's legitimacy arose, Davide and Panganiban recused themselves from the Supreme Court proceedings. On March 2, 2001, the court voted 13‚Äì0 to uphold Arroyo's ascension to the top post. A month later, the court again voted 13‚Äì0 to deny with finality Estrada's motion for reconsideration. Chief Justice Justice Panganiban was named Supreme Court Chief Justice on December 20, 2005 by President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo after Hilario Davide Jr. retired at age 70. Other nominees by the Judicial and Bar Council included Senior Associate Justice Reynato Puno and Associate Justice Leonardo Quisumbing. Puno was the most senior in terms of career in the Supreme Court while Panganiban was the most senior in terms of age. Panganiban was succeeded by Puno after only two years in office in December 2007. Short-term tenures of high-ranking appointees are a distinctive feature of the Philippine political system. Chief Justice Panganiban drew controversy for his remarks made in June 2006 regarding the 1998 decision of the Supreme Court, in which he participated, affirming the death penalty imposed on Leo Echegaray. Echegaray, a convicted rapist was executed the following year in what was the first execution in the Philippines since the regime of Ferdinand Marcos. Panganiban, whose anti-death penalty views are well known, suggested that the Supreme Court may have committed \\"a judicial error\\" in executing Echegaray, as not all of the qualifying circumstances needed to promulgate a death conviction were actually established.Chief Justice: SC error led to execution ‚Äì INQ7.net His remarks, coming at the heels of the passage by Congress of a law abolishing the death penalty, were criticized by death-penalty advocates and some newspaper editorials.

The easternmost community in the historic town of Thornhill, German Mills was named for the early German settlers in the area. History German Mills is closely associated with the founding of Toronto, then called \\"Muddy York\\", and with the early history of Markham, previously called \\"Mannheim\\" (\\"the home of man\\"). German Mills was part of Lieutenant Governor John Graves Simcoe's plan to establish a bulwark against a possible American invasion. At the time, there was a critical need to find settlers for the province, while at the same time building the capital of York and surrounding areas. Simcoe favoured settlements where military township grants allowed soldiers to act as consumers for local markets and town centres. In 1793, German Mills was an agricultural settlement, supplying food for its citizens and the military when Toronto was little more than an outpost in the wilderness. When William Moll Berczy led a group of 64 families (182 people) to old York County in the summer of 1794, German Mills became the first significant industrial complex in Markham Township. Berczy was a multi-talented entrepreneur with leadership, architectural, engineering and painting skills. His group consisted of bakers, blacksmiths, carpenters, shoemakers, weavers, a preacher, a school teacher, a brewer, a cartwright, a locksmith, a miller, a potter, a tanner, stonemasons and farmers. At the time, both Toronto and Markham were surrounded by a thick, mature forest of pine, oak, maple and butternut trees, which were ideal for lumber. In the fall of 1794, William Berczy hired men to erect a large house and a sawmill at what is now German Mills. To bring prosperity and new settlers, a warehouse for the Northwest Fur Trade Company was constructed at what later became Unionville, Ontario. It served as an intermediate stop for the northern fur trade route on the Nin (Rouge River). An agreement between Andrew Pierce and the German Land Company, signed and dated January 1, 1793, supplied oxen and cattle from Connecticut to both the town of York and to German Mills. They were sent prior to the arrival of the first settler groups, in 1794. In November, 1794, some of the oxen kept at the German Land Company warehouse, located at the southeast corner of present King and Sherbourne Streets in the town of York, were used in the construction of Yonge Street, now the world's longest street. Other oxen and cattle were shipped to German Mills in flat-bottomed boats up the Don River and then via its tributary, German Mills Creek. At the time, both rivers had a larger water flow. The German Mills industrial complex consisted of a grist mill, which produced super-fine flour, a sawmill and a blacksmith's forge. The sawmill produced shingles and lumber for the buildings in the German Mills area and for the first houses in Toronto, notably Russell Abbey, the home of the Hon. Peter Russell, Administrator of Upper Canada on Palace Street in 1797. This house established William Moll Berczy's reputation as an architect. He is known today as the \\"Founder of Markham\\" and \\"Co-Founder of Toronto\\". Six years later, when it became apparent that water-power produced by the Don River was insufficient to operate the mills, the German Mills industrial complex went into decline. Zoning German Mills is now primarily a residential neighbourhood. Most homes are single-family residences, many built in the 1970s and 1980s. Area commuters rely heavily on cars, but the York Region Transit does offer bus services. Parks German Mills Community Centre. The few parks in the neighbourhood bear the names of settlers and of settlements: * German Mills Settlers Park ‚Äì a site used for sand aggregate extraction (1940s‚Äì1960s) and Sabiston Landfill (1960‚Äì1975).http://www.markham.ca/markham/ccbs/indexfile/Agendas/2011/General/gc110530/Former%20Sabiston%20Landfill%20Site%20-%20Information%20%20Status%20Update%20south%20boundary.pdf * Berczy Park * Bishop Cross Park The German Mills Community Centre is a former schoolhouse (S.S. 2 ), one of the few surviving schoolhouses in Markham.

Subject matter deals with Simcoe's brilliant idea to employ Berczy's Germans as road builders and creators of an agricultural hinterland for York, just as the old fox Robert Morris had done for Williamsburg, appealed to Berczy because he harbored similar plans. \\"Mannheim, the home of man\\" comes from interviews held with descendants of Berczy settlers, by John Lunau a long-time curator of the Markham Museum, who often made reference to the name Mannheim at public meetings and town conventions. The Scadding Bridge, named after Simcoe's Estate Administrator, was the first structure of any kind to span the Don River and served to link York with the Kingston Road. It stood near what is now the junction of King and Queen streets in Toronto. The bridge was designed by William Berczy and was already in use in 1794 for the transport of lumber from Markham to \\"Muddy York\\". Original drawings of the bridge are preserved in the National Archive in Ottawa. Also see Canadian Archives Publication 8, 1912, No. 2660. Don Bridge, sketch by Berczy, is preserved in the Canadian National Archive, Ottawa. The Russell Abbey was designed by William Berczy and was occupied by Peter Russell.

It was also called Port Discovery Bay for some time, a name that can be found on maps from the 1940s and earlier. Port Discovery is also the name of a historically significant community that was located on the bay for roughly a hundred years; it disappeared in the late 20th century, with the collapse of the local timber industry. The bay The bay was first visited by Europeans in 1790, during the expedition of Manuel Quimper in the Princesa Real, with Juan Carrasco as pilot. They gave it the name Puerto de Quadra, after Juan Francisco de la Bodega y Quadra, their commander at San Blas. In 1791 Francisco de Eliza used Port Discovery as his base of operations for further explorations. Rainbow over Discovery Bay, taken from Gardiner, Washington The name Port Discovery was given by George Vancouver in his 1792 visit to the Strait of Juan de Fuca, and honors his ship the Discovery. Vancouver's landing place was apparently at what was later called Carr Point (also Contractors Point). Port Discovery was a regular port of call for ships traversing the Pacific until the mid 20th century, and in particular for many U.S. ships involved in World War II, such as , , and . The wreck of War Hawk, a clipper ship which burned and sank in 1883, is a popular dive site in the bay, near Mill Point.http://www.boydski.com/diving/photos/wrecks/WarkHawk/Warhawk_Wreck.htm The community In the 19th century, Port Discovery became an important coastal community, centered on a large sawmill that was established in 1858. The settlement called Port Discovery was located at what now is called Mill Point, on the west shore of the bay, to the east of U.S. Highway 101 at what is now Broders Road. This spot is several miles north of the current settlements at the foot of Discovery Bay.Jefferson County Historical Society archives and publications, Port Townsend Washington The town at Mill Point dwindled after the closing of the sawmill, and vanished after the later collapse of the local timber industry. Only a couple of houses and an old pier remain at the site, which is private property. Until around 2008, the prominent remains of another famous sawmill were visible further down the shore from Mill Point, near what was Maynard, Washington at the foot of the bay. The romantic, derelict building was adjacent to Highway 101, and was thus seen by every passing motorist; it was one of the most-photographed sites in the area for decades. Many such photos are mislabeled as the Port Discovery mill, although the Maynard mill was built later. By 2010, the building's vestiges were removed, in efforts to restore Discovery Bay salmon and shellfish habitat.

The 2011 population of this area was 9,880. Adding Cornell North's 2,178 (from 16th Avenue to Donald Cousens Parkway) it had 12,058 residents.http://geodepot.statcan.gc.ca/GeoSearch2011-GeoRecherche2011/GeoSearch2011-GeoRecherche2011.jsp? History Cornell was conceived in the 1990s planning process by the town of Markham. Unlike other Markham communities, Cornell is a planned community. One of the original settlers was Christian Reesor. He and his family settled in Cornell. Their original homestead was on Reesor Road. The name 'Cornell' derives from the maiden name of the wife of Christian Reesor's youngest son, who continued to live at the family homestead. William Cornell Cornell's name was selected in 1999 from a suggestion by local lawyer Paul Mingay.Cornell Mingay's family roots can be traced back to Susan Emily Cornell, a descendant of William Cornell (1766-1860), settler from Rhode Island who came to Canada in 1799 and settled in Scarborough, Ontario in 1800. Later Cornells settled in Markham, Ontario and married into the Reesor family. William Cornell immigrated to Canada from Rhode Island and is a distant relative of Ezra Cornell, founder of Cornell University. Community description Most of the houses are townhomes, semi-detached, or detached houses with garages at the rear. The communities are built with central amenities in order to contain suburban sprawl. Cornell was seen by the Markham Town Council as a way to deter the ongoing sprawl by encouraging residential density. The community, particularly Cornell Village, is designed as a walkable neighborhood with a variety of housing types and retail. Cornell Village, between Highway 7 and 16th Avenue, is fully populated with medium density residential. The southern section of Cornell (south of Highway 7), however, is not populated, and remains as a wild field and a farm. In 2012, the City of Markham completed Fire Station 99 to serve the area. Demography Cornell is a diverse community. Subdivisions within Cornell Cornell can be further separated by development phases: * Grand Cornell - located near Highway 7 and 9th Line and built by builders H&R; (renamed as Lindvest), GreenPark and CountryWide * Upper Cornell - located near 16th Avenue and 9th Line and built by builders Aspen Ridge or Beaverbrook * Cornell Village - located between 16th Avenue and Highway 7 along 9th Line to Cornell Centre Blvd; built by builders Mattamy or Ballantry * Cornell Rouge - located east of William Forster Road/Cornell Centre Blvd to Donald Cousens Parkway between 16th Avenue and Highway 7; built by builders of Madison Homes and Forest Hill The remaining portions of Cornell are still non-agricultural grasslands, but it will slowly disappear with further development. In 2004 there was a plan to create a residential and retail development called \\"Cornell Town Centre\\" along the southern end of Cornell.http://www.talbotconsultants.com/articles/cornell_town_centre.pdf This plan never materialized and most of the area has since been re-developed as residential homes. The man-made recreational Cornell Lake is now a series of ponds that carries the waters of Little Rouge Creek in Grand Cornell development. Transportation=Air This area is mainly served by Toronto Pearson International Airport for civilian air travel. The development is not far from the proposed Pickering Airport and once one of the sites for landfills in the Greater Toronto Area. While runway 10R/28L will still be within Pickering, the southwest end of the property will be located north of 16th Avenue and 9th Line. Toronto/Markham Airport is located north in Dickson Hill, Ontario is a privately owned general aviation airfield. Public transit Transportation links to the community include GO Transit, and York Region Transit.

School Section # 2 was established here in 1847, and a log school was built during the same year. In 1954, the area south of Steeles Avenue was severed from York County, forming the Municipality of Metropolitan Toronto. As the community was situated along Steeles Avenue, it was split between the two county/metropolitan governments. The southern portion of the community, Milliken, became a part of Metropolitan Toronto, whereas the northern portion of the community, Milliken Mills, remained with York County (reorganized into the Regional Municipality of York in 1971). Once agricultural land, much of which disappeared with residential development beginning in the 1970s and ending near the late 1980s. The City of Markham initiated an initiative to develop \\"Main Street Milliken\\" around Old Kennedy Rd. The area has suffered from years of neglect, and revitalization plans have been welcomed by community members. New developments include a condominium development on Kennedy and Denison, Dairy Queen, Major Milliken Pub and a new housing project on Old Kennedy Rd. The neighbourhood only gave up its final farming activities in the early 1980s and is modernizing by the year. There are green spaces such as Milliken Park, Goldhawk Park and many others, also the Milliken Trail is a walking tour of the neighbourhood. Culture A growing hub of community activity is Milliken Park Community Recreation Centre, which is located on the Northwest corner of Milliken Park and at the Southeast corner of the intersection of Steeles Avenue and McCowan Road. The centre is home to a variety of camps, after-school programs and cultural activities designed to cater to local demand.

In recent years, the South Asian population has also boomed within the region, particularly the Sri Lankan Tamil and Indian Gujarati community. For example, a South Asian movie theatre is now located at the Woodside Square Mall at McCowan and Finch and plans are also in place for a major South Asian mall to be developed at Finch and Middlefield.

Ecomuseums originated in France, the concept being developed by Georges Henri Rivi√®re and Hugues de Varine, who coined the term ‚Äòecomus√©e‚Äô in 1971.Marie-Odile de Bary, Andr√© Desvalles, Fran√ßoise Wasserman (editors), 1994, Vagues: une anthologie de la nouvelle mus√©ologie, M√¢con; Savigny-le Temple (77), Editions W ; M.N.E.S. The term \\"√©co\\" is a shortened form for \\"√©cologie\\", but it refers especially to a new idea of holistic interpretation of cultural heritage, in opposition to the focus on specific items and objects, performed by traditional museums.Peter Davis, 1999, Ecomuseums: a sense of place, Leicester University Press. There are presently about 300 operating ecomuseums in the world; about 200 are in Europe, mainly in France, Italy, Spain, and Poland.For an up-to-date directory of websites on this subject, see Cl√©mence Perrier-Latour, 2005, Web links and bibliography on ecomuseums, ICOM News, n. 3/2005.  Development  Introduced by the French museologist Hugues de Varine in 1971, the word ecomuseum has often been misused and the definition of an ecomuseum is still a controversial matter for contemporary museology.Andrea Hauenschild, 1998, Claims and reality of new museology : case studies in Canada, the United States and Mexico, Washington, D.C.: Center for Museum Studies, Smithsonian Institution. Many museologists sought to define the distinctive features of ecomuseums, listing their characteristics.For a synthetic view on ecomuseum definitions, see: Gerard Corsane, Peter Davis, Sarah Elliott, Maurizio Maggi, Donatella Murtas & Sally Rogers, Ecomuseum Evaluation: Experiences in Piemonte and Liguria, Italy, International Journal of Heritage Studies, Vol. 13, No. 2, March 2007, pp. 101‚Äì116. Following a complexity approach, in recent definitions, ecomuseums are more properly defined by what they do rather than by what they are.See Coveney Peter and Roger Highfield,1995, Frontiers of Complexity, Faber & Faber, New York-London, (p. 17) on the difference between form and matter in complex evaluation and Gerard Corsane, Peter Davis, Sarah Elliott, Maurizio Maggi, Donatella Murtas & Sally Rogers, Ecomuseum Performance in Piemonte and Liguria, Italy: The Significance of Capital, International Journal of Heritage Studies, Vol. 13, No. 3, May 2007, pp. 224‚Äì239 for an applied example The ecomuseum phenomenon has grown dramatically over the years, with no one ecomuseum model but rather an entire philosophy that has been adapted and molded for use in a variety of situations. As many more ecomuseums are established across the world the idea has been growing and the changes in the approach towards the philosophy are reflected in the reactions of the communities involved. In recent time particular significance is the rise in ecomuseology in India, China, Taiwan, Japan, Thailand, Vietnam and Cambodia, with significant increase in Italy, Poland, the Czech Republic and Turkey. Ecomuseums are an important medium through which a community can take control of its heritage and enable new approaches to make meaning out of conserving its local distinctiveness.  Definition from the European Network of Ecomuseums  > An Ecomuseum is a dynamic way in which communities preserve, interpret, and > manage their heritage for a sustainable development. An Ecomuseum is based > on a community agreement. ‚Äî Declaration of Intent of the Long Net Workshop, Trento (Italy), May 2004 Dynamic way means to go beyond the formal aspect of an ecomuseum, beyond a simple set course, designed on paper; it is about designing real actions, able to change our society and improve our landscape. Community means a group with: * General involvement; * Shared responsibilities; * Interchangeable roles: public officers, representatives, volunteers and other local actors are all playing a vital role in an ecomuseum. Community involvement does not mean that local administrations, a unique historical heritage of European democracy, are irrelevant. On the contrary their role, to be effective, must involve people, going beyond the narrow circle of ‚Äúauthorized personnel‚Äù. Preservation, interpretation and management means that reading and communicating heritage values, providing new interpretations of it and raising its profile, are part of the day-to-day activity for ecomuseums. Heritage is very close to Place as a notion, including history of inhabitants and things, what is visible and what it is not, tangibles and intangibles, memories and future. Sustainable development is a central issue for ecomuseums and it implies also to increase the value of a place instead of diminishing it. Evidence from best practices identifies in this process two key elements: place-based development, as previously described, and the improvement of local networks, where ecomuseums have to play a key role as catalysts of social capital development. Agreement means a mutual consent, implying reciprocal commitments between local players. The Polish national meeting, once more, put forward the idea of ‚Äúvoluntary meeting of people‚Äù.  The 2016 Milan Cooperation Charter  In 2016 inside the 24th ICOM General Conference \\"Museums and cultural landscape\\" of Milan, the first Forum of ecomuseums and community museums took place. The goals of the forum were to share experiences, questions and difficulties that ecomuseums face; to share their future projects; to envisage any prospect of exchange or collaboration with the visitors. During the Forum \\"it was proposed to establish an International Platform for exchanges and experience sharing\\", and \\"decided to create a permanent international Working Group to keep watch and make proposals on the theme territory-heritage-landscape.\\" In the early 2017 on the basis of ideas, issues and debates raised by participants during the Forum a common vision was drawn and a provisional ‚ÄúMilan Cooperation Charter‚Äù was adopted.  The DROPS Platform  In the early 2017 the world platform for exchange and experience sharing between ecomuseums and community museums was published. The platform called DROPS aims at ‚Äúconnecting all national Ecomuseums and Community Museums and their networks, existing or to be established, and all other heritage and landscape NGOs, in a virtual and interactive space‚Äù and at the ‚Äúproduction of a multilingual documentary and a bibliographic pool of resources on ecomuseology and its best practices‚Äù Santo, R.

It was opened 6 February 1871, after a long campaign by Learmonth Whyte Dalrymple. It is reputedly the oldest girls state-run secondary school in the Southern Hemisphere and the sixth oldest of its type in the world.Otago Museum article The school has its own radio show on Otago Access Radio. Building history At its foundation the school occupied a neo-classical building on its present site which it shared with Otago Boys' High School. A new building on another site was built for the boys which they marched away to occupy in 1885. In 1910 the present main block was opened, designed by Edmund Anscombe (1874‚Äì1948) and the old building on Tennyson Street was demolished. Anscombe's conception of a rouge-brick Elizabethan mansion, dreaming in the sun, was slowly extended. Temporary structures were replaced in the 1970s by Ministry of Education blocks, contextualised by the use of brick to the Anscombe building. In the 1980s the main block was scheduled for demolition.

Her art consists of surreal paintings dealing with Iranian themed imagery and strong lighting.  Biography = Early life  Born in Mashhad, Iran to a family consisting of traders from Khorasan on her father's side and on her mother's side the family was Caucasian merchants who had settled in Mashhad. Her family moved to Hamburg, Germany for her father's business in 1937 and by the early 1940s they were forced to leave because of the beginnings of World War II. By 1945 her family returned to Mashhad. Darroudi studied at Ecole Superier des Beaux-Arts in Paris, history of art at the √âcole du Louvre in Paris, stained glass at the Royal Academy of Brussels, and television direction and production at the RCA Institute in New York City.  Career  Iran Darroudi‚Äôs paintings are defined as Surrealist works. She is able to combine the delicacy and romantic spirit of Persian paintings with the elements of Surrealism. Darroudi's first solo exhibition was held in Miami, Florida in 1958 at the invitation of the Florida State Art Center. She wrote articles on the history of art and art criticism for the conservative Iranian newspaper, Kayhan. In 1968, she made 55 minute long documentary about the 1968 Venice Biennial. She was appointed as an honorary professor at the Industrial University of Tehran, teaching art history. In 1969 the ITT Corporation commissioned her to paint Iranian Oil. She held successful exhibitions in Paris and at the Atrium Artist Gallery, Geneva, and a month later at Galarie 21, Zurich. In 1976 she exhibited at the Mexican Museum of Art, where Spanish painter Antonio Rodr√≠guez Luna praised her as one of the world's four greatest painters. In 1978 she moved to France. In 2009 a documentary Iran Darroudi: The Painter of Ethereal Moments produced by Bahman Maghsoudlou, focused on the life and art of Darroundi.  Personal life  In 1966 in New York City, she met and married Parviz Moghaddasi, who was studying television direction. The couple worked at the newly established Iranian television organization as producer and director for six years. Her husband Parviz Moqaddasi died in 1985, her first art after his death was a piece titled, Assumption of Parviz.

It is located in V√¶r√∏y Municipality in Nordland county, Norway. Mostad was in its prime around the year 1900 when over 120 people lived here. However, because there are no roads connecting to it and that it has a very unsatisfactory harbour, the village was abandoned a few years after World War II. The last citizens left Mostad in the 1950s. Today, the place is an El Dorado for those who seek wilderness and beauty. From 1950 to 1960, there were several houses from Mostad that were moved to the village of S√∏rland on the other side of the island where living was much easier. only a few houses are left still standing. Catching puffins was a subsidiary source of income beside fishing. Catching puffins involved the use of the unusual puffin dog, also termed the Mostad dog or the Norwegian Lundehund. Puffin meat was cured in salt and lasted way into the autumn. Today, there are about 600 puffin dogs in Norway. All of them can be traced back to Mostad. Going ashore on Mostad is generally combined with a fishing trip or an expedition by boat to the bird cliffs. Mostad can also be reached by foot. Since 1996, simple overnight accommodation has been available at the schoolhouse in Mostad. In literature P√•l Espolin Johnson's \\"For Love of Norway\\" is a fictionalized history of the village seen through the eyes of Magda, who arrives in 1909 to marry a local fisherman. This compelling, simply-told episodic account of residents of Mostad in the first few decades of the 20th century provides an intimate glimpse in lives lived in a harsh and unforgiving place, but one filled with human warmth.

Georgian literary tradition credits the first king of Kartli, Pharnavaz I of Iberia (assumed to have reigned c. 302-237 BC), with the raising of the idol Armazi ‚Äì reputedly named after him ‚Äì on a mountain at his capital, and the construction of an Armazi fortress. The Life of Nino (9th or 10th century) describes the statue of Armazi as \\"a man of bronze standing; attached to his body was a golden suit of chain-armour, on his head a strong helmet; for eyes he had emeralds and beryls, in his hands he held a sabre glittering like lighting, and it turned in his hands.\\" The same account asserts that its subject, a 4th-century female baptizer of Georgians Saint Nino, witnessed the celebration of a great feast of dedication for the idol, and as she began praying, the idol was burnt by lightning.Rapp, Stephen H. (2003), Studies In Medieval Georgian Historiography: Early Texts And Eurasian Contexts, pp. 277-278. Peeters Bvba, . Beyond the medieval Georgian annals, composed five or more centuries after Christianization, there are no records of the pre-Christian Georgian pantheon. Modern scholars are divided as to the origin of the name Armazi. It would appear to be connected to the Zoroastrian supreme god Ahura MazdƒÅ (Middle Persian Ohrmazd, Armenian Aramazd) and contemporary archaeological evidence does suggest the penetration of Zoroastrianism in ancient Georgia. On the other hand, Giorgi Melikishvili proposed the identification of Armazi as a local variant of Arma, the god of the moon in Hittite mythology. This is in keeping with Ivane Javakhishvili's argument of a pre-Christian Georgian moon cult, which fused with the Christian St. George (Tetri Giorgi), Georgia's patron saint since the Middle Ages.

Geography It is the largest extension to the city of Nice and lies to the west-southwest of it, about from the center. History It was the retreat and final address of the painter Pierre-Auguste Renoir, who moved there in 1907 in an attempt to improve his arthritis, and remained until his death in 1919. In the late 1920s, Cagnes-sur-Mer became a residence for many American renowned literary and art figures, such as Kay Boyle, George Antheil and Harry and Caresse Crosby.Antheil, George (1952); Bad Boy of Music Author Georges Simenon (1903‚Äì1989), creator of the fictional detective Commissaire Jules Maigret, lived at 98, mont√©e de la Bourgade in the 1950s with his third wife and their three children; his initial \\"S\\" may still be seen in the wrought iron on the stairs. Parisian artist, poet, and philosopher Georges Charaire had a home In Cagnes for many years. Creating his lithographs in the former studio of Paul Gauguin, and also as a co-founder of the Theatre du Tertre in Montmartre, he had a great influence on French art and thought in the 20th century. He helped his friend Eug√®ne Ionesco with his first plays at the Theatre du Tertre. Charaire kept his second home in Cagnes sur Mer until his death in 2001. Belarusian-French artist Chaim Soutine created powerful, fanciful landscapes of southern France. A friend of Amedeo Modigliani, Soutine left colourful landscapes from Cagnes from 1924 on. Fauvist painter Francisco Iturrino also resided in the town where he died. The town may have been an inspiration for Neo-impressionist Henri-Edmond Cross (1856‚Äì1910), the artist who painted Cypresses at Cagnes (1908). PopulationSights Places of interest include Renoir's estate, Les Collettes, surrounded by olive trees ; the Medieval castle at le Haut-de-Cagnes and the Cros quarter, founded by Italian fishermen in the nineteenth century.

The rock pigeon is the world's oldest domesticated bird. Mesopotamian cuneiform tablets mention the domestication of pigeons more than 5,000 years ago, as do Egyptian hieroglyphics. Research suggests that domestication of pigeons occurred as early as 10,000 years ago. Pigeons have made contributions of considerable importance to humanity, especially in times of war. In war the homing ability of pigeons has been put to use by making them messengers. So- called war pigeons have carried many vital messages and some have been decorated for their services. Medals such as the Croix de guerre, awarded to Cher Ami, and the Dickin Medal awarded to the pigeons G.I. Joe and Paddy, amongst 32 others, have been awarded to pigeons for their services in saving human lives. Reproduction Domestic pigeons reproduce in a similar way to the wild rock pigeon. Generally humans will select breeding partners. Crop milk or pigeon milk produced by both male and female parent birds may occasionally be replaced with artificial substitutes. Pigeons are extremely protective of their eggs, and in some cases will go to severe lengths to protect their productive eggs and have been known to seek revenge on those who interfere with their productive process. Baby pigeons are called squeakers or squabs. Homing pigeons Homing pigeon Dovecote at Nymans Gardens, West Sussex, England 18-day-old pigeon in its nest and one egg Group of pigeons Trained domestic pigeons are able to return to the home loft if released at a location that they have never visited before and that may be up to 1000 km away. This ability a pigeon has to return home from a strange location necessitates two sorts of information. The first, called \\"map sense\\" is their geographic location. The second, \\"compass sense\\" is the bearing they need to fly from their new location in order to reach their home. Both of these senses, however, respond to a number of different cues in different situations. The most popular conception of how pigeons are able to do this is that they are able to sense the Earth's magnetic field with tiny magnetic tissues in their head (magnetoception). Another theory is that pigeons have compass sense, which uses the position of the sun, along with an internal clock, to work out direction. However, studies have shown that if magnetic disruption or clock changes disrupt these senses, the pigeon can still manage to get home. The variability in the effects of manipulations to these sense of the pigeons indicates that there is more than one cue on which navigation is based and that map sense appears to rely on a comparison of available cues A special breed, called homing pigeons, has been developed through selective breeding to carry messages, and members of this variety of pigeon are still being used in the sport of pigeon racing and the white release dove ceremony at weddings and funerals. Other potential cues used include: *The use of a sun compass *Nocturnal navigation by starsKramer, G. (1952). Experiments in bird orientation.

Monitore Zoologico Italiano, vol. 20, pp. 471‚Äì517. ::see: Olfactory navigation Other purposes of pigeon breeding=For food Pigeons are also bred for meat, generally called squab and harvested from young birds. Pigeons grow to a very large size in the nest before they are fledged and able to fly, and in this stage of their development (when they are called squabs) they are prized as food. For commercial meat production a breed of large white pigeon, named \\"King pigeon,\\" has been developed by selective breeding. Breeds of pigeons developed for their meat are collectively known as utility pigeons. Exhibition breeds Pigeon fanciers developed many exotic forms of pigeon. These are generally classed as fancy pigeons. Fanciers compete against each other at exhibitions or shows and the different forms or breeds are judged to a standard to decide who has the best bird. Among those breeds are the English carrier pigeons, a variety of pigeon with wattles and a unique, almost vertical, stance (pictures). There are many ornamental breeds of pigeons, including the \\"Duchess\\" breed, which has as a prominent characteristic feet that are completely covered by a sort of fan of feathers. The fantail pigeons are also very ornamental with their fan-shaped tail feathers. Flying/Sporting Domestic pigeons in flight Pigeons are also kept by enthusiasts for the enjoyment of Flying/Sporting competitions. Breeds such as tipplers are flown in endurance contests by their owners. Experimentation Domestic pigeons are also commonly used in laboratory experiments in biology, medicine and cognitive science. Cognitive science Pigeons have been trained to distinguish between cubist and impressionist paintings, for instance. In Project Sea Hunt, a US coast guard search and rescue project in the 1970s/1980s, pigeons were shown to be more effective than humans in spotting shipwreck victims at sea. Research in pigeons is widespread, encompassing shape and texture perception, exemplar and prototype memory, category-based and associative concepts, and many more unlisted here (see pigeon intelligence). Pigeons are able to acquire orthographic processing skills, which form part of the ability to read, and basic numerical skills equivalent to those shown in primates. Illegal predator killing by enthusiasts In the United States, some pigeon keepers illegally trap and kill hawks and falcons to protect their pigeons. In American pigeon-related organizations, some enthusiasts have openly shared their experiences of killing hawks and falcons, although this is frowned upon by the majority of fanciers. None of the major clubs condone this practice. It is estimated that almost 1,000 birds of prey have been killed in Oregon and Washington, and that 1,000‚Äì2,000 are killed in southern California annually. In June 2007, three Oregon men were indicted with misdemeanour violations of the Migratory Bird Treaty Act for killing birds of prey. Seven Californians and a Texan were also charged in the case. In the West Midlands region of the United Kingdom pigeon fanciers have been blamed for a trap campaign to kill peregrine falcons. Eight illegal spring- loaded traps were found close to peregrine nests and at least one of the protected birds died. The steel traps are thought to have been set as part of a \\"concerted campaign\\" to kill as many of the birds as possible in the West Midlands. Pigeon related illness Chicago-native Columba livia domestica in flight. Pigeon breeders sometimes suffer from an ailment known as bird fancier's lung or pigeon lung. A form of hypersensitivity pneumonitis, pigeon lung is caused by the inhalation of the avian proteins found in feathers and dung. It can sometimes be combated by wearing a filtered mask. Other pigeon related pathogens causing lung disease are Chlamydophila psittaci (which causes psittacosis), Histoplasma capsulatum (which causes histoplasmosis) and Cryptococcus neoformans), which causes cryptococcosis. Feral pigeons Feral rock pigeons commonly show a very wide range of plumage variation. Many domestic birds have escaped or been released over the years, and have given rise to the feral pigeon. These show a variety of plumages, although some look very much like pure rock pigeons. The scarcity of the pure wild species is partly due to interbreeding with feral birds. Domestic pigeons can often be distinguished from feral pigeons because they usually have a metal or plastic band around one (sometimes both) legs which shows, by a number on it, that they are registered to an owner.

Life He was born in Vicenza, Italy, and studied law and philosophy in Padua. He was deeply moved by the Reformation. The Catholic Church considered him immoral and a lover of heretical writings and he found himself put on trial by the Inquisition. Fleeing first to Geneva to escape their wrath, he soon converted to Protestantism while in Heidelberg. His academic career was wide and varied, as he became an itinerant figure. In Geneva, he was elected as a public professor, and taught from 1575 to 1585. Studious and having a deep knowledge of Greek, he translated Aristotle. He taught law at the University of Heidelberg, from 1585 to 1594. Incidentally, while he was at Heidelberg, his quarrels with compatriot Scipione Gentili ultimately compelled the latter to leave for Altdorf. Also while there he showed his Ramist sympathies, but came into conflict with the philosophical faculty for trying to give private tuition in Ramist logic.http://fds.oup.com/www.oup.co.uk/pdf/0-19-817430-6.pdf , p. 22. After spending 1595 teaching logic at the Academy of Sedan, he was provost and prefect of studies at the University of Nimes, from 1597 to 1600. He also taught philosophy in Hungary, Leiden in the Netherlands, Grenoble in France, and in other places. At the University of Montpellier, where he was from 1600 to 1616, Nicolas Claude Fabri de Peiresc was his pupil.Galileo Project page He also taught at the University of Valence, 1620-1, before taking a position at Padua where he taught from 1621 to 1635.Charles B.

Works De dominio maris Hadriatici, 1619 Pace's edition of the Organon became standard during its life of 11 editions between 1584 and 1623, and even longer in the north of Europe. He also wrote a great many legal titles. Pace wrote a pocket summary of Ramon Llull's art, first in Latin in 1618 and then in French in 1619. This work is seen as exceptional among its contemporaries as it does not digress into alchemy, cabalism, or magic, and in fact stays true to Llull's traditional interests. Pace wrote a similar work for Ramus as well. Despite being a Protestant, in 1619 he published \\"De dominio maris Hadriatici dissertatio\\", defending the claims of the Venetian Republic to dominion over the Adriatic Sea, against the opposite claims of the Empire and the Kingdom of Naples. This controversy in early international law lined him up with Paolo Sarpi, against Valenzuela Vel√°zquez and Lorenzo Motino.Guido Acquaviva, Il Dominio di Venezia sul Mare Adriatico nelle opere di Paolo Sarpi e Giulio Pace (Giuffre': Milan, 2007) (Jan Hendrik Willem Verzijl, Wybo P.

Early life and education Paul and his twin brother Brand were born in Fredericksburg, Ohio, where their father, Francis, was a Congregational minister. Rev. Blanshard and his wife, Emily Coulter Blanshard were Canadian. They met in high school while living in Weston, Ontario, immediately north of Toronto. When the twins were 12 months, their mother fell down stairs holding a lighted oil lamp. Her clothing caught fire, and she died a day later of severe burns. The Rev. Blanshard brought his sons to Grand Rapids, Michigan, for maternal care by his mother, Orminda Adams Blanshard, widow of Methodist clergyman Shem Blanshard. Francis left them in her care, briefly to pastor a church in Helena, Montana. In 1899 the four moved south to Edinburg, Ohio. Upon being diagnosed with tuberculosis, Francis was advised to seek the drier climate of the American West. In 1902, Rev. Blanshard bade his mother and sons goodbye. They moved northwest to Bay View, Michigan, and he moved alone to Albuquerque, New Mexico, where, in 1904, he died, alone in a tent. Orminda Blanshard raised her grandsons on an annual pension of $250 from the Methodist church while the boys washed dishes at a restaurant. Realizing their need for good education, the family relocated to Detroit in 1908 so the boys could graduate from the well-known Central High School. Soon both were at the top of their class, joined the debating team, and Brand was made class Poet. In 1910 the Blanshard brothers entered the University of Michigan, whose annual tuition was only $30 for state residents. > \\"It was natural that Brand and I should go in for debating and oratory, and > each of us won the university's oratorical contest in successive years. > Further, we each won in successive years the National Peace Oratorical > Contest in which almost one hundred colleges participated. - We almost lived > in the college library and reveled in its riches, counting ourselves among > the blessed of the earth and coming out somewhere near the top of our class > as a result. When we were juniors in 1913, Brand won a Rhodes Scholarship to > Oxford and soon left for England. Perhaps that was good for me because I was > now compelled to stand on my own, becoming much more sociable, outgoing and > aggressive. During those college years I arrived at two decisions about > myself. I would be a socialist and I would enter the Christian ministry. In > retrospect, the first decision seems entirely natural, but the second > decision was the worst blunder of my life.\\" Seminary, socialism, war, and apostasy Following graduation from Michigan in 1914, Blanshard enrolled in Harvard Divinity School. Prior to entry, he joined the Socialist Party, of which he remained a member for 19 years. Blanshard found his studies replete with \\"verbal evasion\\" and wryly observed that \\"This institution was what Mark Twain would have called a theological cemetery\\". He joined the Boston Socialist Party and sometimes was dispatched to local strikes as a clerical agitator. Under these casual arrangements he met both Nicola Sacco and Bartolomeo Vanzetti. Blanshard described his early preaching experience as relying more upon Bernard Shaw than the Bible. Seated alphabetically for inauguration into Phi Beta Kappa, to Paul's left was Julia Sweet Anderson. A romance and normal courtship was followed by an unusual \\"Marriage Ceremony for Revolutionists\\". The eschewing of a Christian ceremony while still at Harvard Divinity School was a portent. The couple humorously described this as \\"term insurance for our marriage in stead of a straight life policy\\". The young couple became close friends with both Helen Keller and Margaret Sanger. In 1916, the Congregational church urgently dispatched Paul and Julia Blanshard by ship to Tampa, Florida where a breakaway congregation was conducting interracial worship services and angering the community. Paul Blanshard was ordained in a ceremony which first must conclude that the candidate is fit. > \\"There is no doubt that I was unfit, but when I was examined in an open > hearing the ministers failed to ask those questions that would have exposed > my unfitness. No one asked me if I believed in the Virgin birth - I did not > - or in the bodily resurrection of Jesus - I did not - or in the complete > uniqueness of Jesus - I did not. In stead, the ministers happened to ask me > several questions on theology and church history, which I answered correctly > and with an adequate display of ecclesiastical learning. As I knelt at the > end of the proceedings to become, by the laying on of hands, the Reverend > Paul Blanshard, I had such an inner sense of tension and conflict that I > almost stood up and said: Look here, gentlemen, I agree with your moral > aspirations and I love the concept of the church as a center for moral > discussion, but I am much more of a heretic than you think, and I really > don't belong with your bunch at all.\\" Those thoughts notwithstanding, Paul Blanshard later finalized a divinity degree at Union Theological Seminary. From his Tampa pulpit, 1916‚Äì1917, Blanshard preached against US entrance into the Great War. American entry in April 1917 did not stifle his opinion and soon a Tampa daily printed of him: \\"we do not condone treason\\". After a careful, slow, rereading of the New Testament Blanshard decided he was not a Christian believer, resigned his church, became an apostate, and moved to New York City. By nature and personality he was a reformer and muckraker. Blanshard decided to pursue credentials in Law, completing much of his studies in night school, and graduating LLB in 1937 from Brooklyn Law School. He was one of the signers of the Humanist Manifesto. In a speech to the SLID in 1933, Blanshard laid out his vision for 'Socialopia': \\"An international government, speaking an international language would control all battleships, airplanes, munitions and currency. In the U.S. state lines would vanish and the President and Congress would be replaced by a national Socialist planning board.\\" Public office Mayor Fiorello La Guardia appointed Blanshard head of the New York City Department of Investigations and Accounts in 1934. Blanshard's exposures of graft and corruption attracted national attention. These efforts were not possible without learning the complex role in power politics played by the Archdiocese of New York. This admixture of and contests of church and state provoked his curiosity. Fifty years old by the onset of World War II, Blanshard served the State Department as an official in Washington and the Caribbean. As an atheist, he observed the role of religion in these settings generally, but began to focus more upon the specifics and the influence of the Roman Catholic Church. Blanshard was an associate editor of The Nation and served during the 1950s as that magazine's special correspondent in Uzbekistan. He is noted for writing American Freedom and Catholic Power, which attacked the Holy See on grounds that it was a dangerous, powerful, foreign and undemocratic institution. He was invited to attend the famous Houston Ministers Conference and spearhead the questioning of Catholic Presidential candidate Senator John F. Kennedy. Kennedy presumed that Blanshard would be there and studied the 1958 second edition of American Freedom and Catholic Power in preparation. Blanshard did not go to Houston. In his autobiography Blanshard explained his respect and admiration for John F. Kennedy. One week after the inauguration of President Kennedy, Blanshard spoke to a crowd of three thousand at Constitution Hall in Washington on the subject of a Catholic President. Blanshard then represented Protestants and Others United for Separation of Church and State, now called Americans United for Separation of Church and State. The text of that speech was published in pamphlet form, and a speech audiotape is retained by Wheaton College. Death Paul Blanshard died in Florida at the age of 87. Books by Paul Blanshard : * 1923.

Its present identity comes through the 1993 merger of the Evangelical Church in Canada (formerly a conference of the Evangelical Church in North America) and the Missionary Church of Canada, which, before 1987, were two districts of The Missionary Church Christian denomination. The Evangelical Church in Canada had a tradition of evangelistic fervour and fundamentalism,https://www.emcc.ca/files/emccadmin/Resource%20Documents/PositionPapers/articlesoffaithandpractice5_8_2013.pdf practice of spiritual disciplines and emphasis on the Holy Spirit that characterized John Wesley's early Methodist teaching, particularly as it impacted early North American German-speaking immigrants. The Missionary Church of Canada, which originated in the later revival movements in North America in the latter half for the 19th century, contributed the Anabaptist concepts of community, brotherhood and believer's baptism which were distinguishing marks of the Missionary Church's Swiss Mennonite background. The merged denomination uses the Christian Scriptures as its sole source of doctrine and standards of living. There are approximately 150 Evangelical Missionary churches, the majority of which are in Ontario, Alberta and British Columbia. Presently Centre Street Church in Calgary is the EMCC's (as well as Canada's) largest church. The EMCC has launched two colleges: Rocky Mountain College in Calgary, Alberta, and Emmanuel Bible College in Kitchener, Ontario. These institutions have trained over three thousand students to become pastors, church leaders and missionaries. The denomination also runs or is affiliated with 6 camps across Canada. The denomination also sends and supports about 85 missionaries in 24 countries (including some in Canada),https://www.emcc.ca/join-us/friends/recognized-missionaries/ under both its own program (EMCC World Partners) and other mission agencies with evangelical and holistic emphases. Pitch & Praise and JR Pitch Pitch and Praise (stylized Pitch'n'Praise)Pitch and Praise.com was a non-denominational Christian event aimed at reaching out to high school students across Ontario. As one of the largest gatherings of youth in Ontario, Canada, it drew crowds of over 2,000 youth at its peak. It was the brainchild of Dr. Denis Bell in 1974, and run by the Evangelical Missionary Church. The event was held annually on the May long weekend. Pitch was held at Stayner Camp until 2006. Due to the ever-growing attendance, limitations of the existing facilities, and noise complaints, Pitch & Praise was moved to Paris, Ontario at Braeside Pentecostal Camp, which is maintained by the Pentecostal Assemblies of Canada.Braeside Bible Camp The attendees camped out in tents, trailers, or cabins and spent the weekend engaged in various activities. The central program of the weekend was the general sessions. Highlighted by a featured band and a speaker, these sessions were intended to provide an atmosphere in which the Gospel was communicated in relevant and contemporary ways. Over the years, the message of Pitch did not change, though the medium did. Many bands took part in Pitch and Praise throughout the years, including Randy Stonehill, Servant, Newsboys, Pillar, and Starfield There were also sports tournaments, workshops, video game tournaments, and an annual battle of the bands (in which the winner was awarded recording time in a studio). Added in 2002, the Club became a successful feature of Pitch. International EDM artists such as Andy Hunter, Galactus Jack, DJ Kubiks,DJ Kubiks and DJ Chris Harrington took part in Pitch and Praise, both in the club and during main sessions. In its later years, Pitch and Praise was criticized by some youth groups in attendance for hosting \\"controversial\\" speakers (i.e. LGBTQ+ affirming speakers, Peter Rollins, who considers himself Christian but not religious, and Drew Marshall, who titled himself an atheist at the time), while also drawing criticism from other groups for \\"playing it safe\\" with speakers (i.e. Hamilton pastor Kevin Makins was removed from the speaker lineup by denominational leadership for his open stance on LGBTQ+ issues.) Pitch and Praise was discontinued by the leadership of the Evangelical Missionary Church of Canada (EMCC), in 2018. According to the EMCC website, there were plans for Pitch to undergo a reboot, targeted specifically at youth from the EMCC denomination, and operating under a modified name: ‚ÄúPitch - The Weekend,\\" based on an event (\\"The Weekend\\") held by the denomination in western Canada. EMCC stated that this new event would \\"bring youth to an understanding of how [Jesus] thinks about the challenges they are facing. We understand their challenges to be around confused messages that come at them about such themes as - identity including sexual identity and who Jesus says they are; truth and its source; desires that feel so right but which lead to unhealthy consequences...\\". Pitch - The Weekend did not take place in 2019 as proposed, and future plans for the event are on hold indefinitely. In 2019, a new non-denominational conference called \\"Phoenix Fest\\" was created by youth pastors from several EMCC churches to provide youth groups with a similar spring retreat in lieu of Pitch and Praise. Phoenix Fest 2019 was considered a success, and due to high demand, will continue to operate annually for the foreseeable future. In 1994 JR Pitch was established to reach out to Jr. High students (grades 6-8) and grew to be attended by over 1,000 pre-teens from across Ontario. JR Pitch took place annually during September and was held in Stayner, Ontario at the Stayner Bible Conference Grounds. JR Pitch was put on indefinite hiatus in 2018. Bibliography *Lageer, E.

In standard ARQ, redundant bits are added to data to be transmitted using an error-detecting (ED) code such as a cyclic redundancy check (CRC). Receivers detecting a corrupted message will request a new message from the sender. In Hybrid ARQ, the original data is encoded with an FEC code, and the parity bits are either immediately sent along with the message or only transmitted upon request when a receiver detects an erroneous message. The ED code may be omitted when a code is used that can perform both forward error correction (FEC) in addition to error detection, such as a Reed‚ÄìSolomon code. The FEC code is chosen to correct an expected subset of all errors that may occur, while the ARQ method is used as a fall-back to correct errors that are uncorrectable using only the redundancy sent in the initial transmission. As a result, hybrid ARQ performs better than ordinary ARQ in poor signal conditions, but in its simplest form this comes at the expense of significantly lower throughput in good signal conditions. There is typically a signal quality cross-over point below which simple hybrid ARQ is better, and above which basic ARQ is better. Simple Hybrid ARQ The simplest version of HARQ, Type I HARQ, adds both ED and FEC information to each message prior to transmission. When the coded data block is received, the receiver first decodes the error-correction code. If the channel quality is good enough, all transmission errors should be correctable, and the receiver can obtain the correct data block. If the channel quality is bad, and not all transmission errors can be corrected, the receiver will detect this situation using the error-detection code, then the received coded data block is rejected and a re- transmission is requested by the receiver, similar to ARQ.Comroe/Costello 1984, p. 474 In a more sophisticated form, Type II HARQ, the message originator alternates between message bits along with error-detecting parity bits and only FEC parity bits. When the first transmission is received error free, the FEC parity bits are never sent. Also, two consecutive transmissions can be combined for error correction if neither is error free.Comroe/Costello 1984, pp. 474‚Äì5 To understand the difference between Type I and Type II Hybrid ARQ, consider the size of ED and FEC added information: error detection typically only adds a couple of bytes to a message, which is only an incremental increase in length. FEC, on the other hand, can often double or triple the message length with error correction parities. In terms of throughput, standard ARQ typically expends a few percent of channel capacity for reliable protection against error, while FEC ordinarily expends half or more of all channel capacity for channel improvement. In standard ARQ a transmission must be received error free on any given transmission for the error detection to pass. In Type II Hybrid ARQ, the first transmission contains only data and error detection (no different from standard ARQ). If received error free, it's done. If data is received in error, the second transmission will contain FEC parities and error detection. If received error free, it's done. If received in error, error correction can be attempted by combining the information received from both transmissions. Only Type I Hybrid ARQ suffers capacity loss in strong signal conditions. Type II Hybrid ARQ does not because FEC bits are only transmitted on subsequent re-transmissions as needed. In strong signal conditions, Type II Hybrid ARQ performs with as good capacity as standard ARQ. In poor signal conditions, Type II Hybrid ARQ performs with as good sensitivity as standard FEC. Hybrid ARQ with soft combining In practice, incorrectly received coded data blocks are often stored at the receiver rather than discarded, and when the re-transmitted block is received, the two blocks are combined. This is called Hybrid ARQ with soft combining (Dahlman et al., p. 120). While it is possible that two given transmissions cannot be independently decoded without error, it may happen that the combination of the previously erroneously received transmissions gives us enough information to correctly decode. There are two main soft combining methods in HARQ: * Chase combining: every re-transmission contains the same information (data and parity bits). The receiver uses maximum-ratio combining to combine the received bits with the same bits from previous transmissions. Because all transmissions are identical, Chase combining can be seen as additional repetition coding. One could think of every re-transmission as adding extra energy to the received transmission through an increased Eb/N0. * Incremental redundancy: every re-transmission contains different information than the previous one. Multiple sets of coded bits are generated, each representing the same set of information bits. The re-transmission typically uses a different set of coded bits than the previous transmission, with different redundancy versions generated by puncturing the encoder output. Thus, at every re-transmission the receiver gains extra information. Several variants of the two main methods exist. For example, in partial Chase combining only a subset of the bits in the original transmission are re- transmitted. In partial incremental redundancy, the systematic bits are always included so that each re-transmission is self-decodable. An example of incremental redundancy HARQ is HSDPA: the data block is first coded with a punctured 1/3 Turbo code, then during each (re)transmission the coded block is usually punctured further (i.e. only a fraction of the coded bits are chosen) and sent. The puncturing pattern used during each (re)transmission is different, so different coded bits are sent at each time. Although the HSDPA standard supports both Chase combining and incremental redundancy, it has been shown that incremental redundancy almost always performs better than Chase combining, at the cost of increased complexity. HARQ can be used in stop-and- wait mode or in selective repeat mode. Stop-and-wait is simpler, but waiting for the receiver's acknowledgment reduces efficiency. Thus multiple stop-and- wait HARQ processes are often done in parallel in practice: when one HARQ process is waiting for an acknowledgment, another process can use the channel to send some more data. There are other forward error correction codes that can be used in an HARQ scheme besides Turbo codes, e.g. extended irregular repeat-accumulate (eIRA) code and Efficiently-Encodable Rate-Compatible (E2RC) code, both of which are low-density parity-check codes.  Applications  HARQ is used in HSDPA and HSUPA which provide high speed data transmission (on downlink and uplink, respectively) for mobile phone networks such as UMTS, and in the IEEE 802.16-2005 standard for mobile broadband wireless access, also known as \\"mobile WiMAX\\". It is also used in Evolution-Data Optimized and LTE wireless networks. Type I Hybrid ARQ is used in ITU-T G.hn, a high-speed Local area network standard that can operate at data rates up to 1 Gbit/s over existing home wiring (power lines, phone lines and coaxial cables). G.hn uses CRC-32C for Error Detection, LDPC for Forward Error Correction and Selective Repeat for ARQ.

The village is named after the painted stork (Mycteria leucocephala), which is called \\"kokkare\\" in the native Kannada language. This bird nests here in large numbers every year. The village is situated near Maddur between the cities of Mysore and Bangalore. Apart from painted storks, spot-billed pelicans are also found here in large numbers. Both are classified to be near threatened in the IUCN Red List. The village is one of the 21 breeding sites of those birds in India. The uniqueness of Kokkarebellur lies in the long-established bond between the spot-billed pelicans and the villagers who have adopted this bird as their local heritage, since they consider the birds as harbingers of good luck and prosperity to the village. The commercial benefits derived by the villagers from these birds include the phosphorus- and potassium-rich manure obtained from the bird droppings (also known as guano). Over the years, the story of this unique relationship between the villagers and the migratory birds has attracted many tourists to the village. Etymology The name of the village \\"Kokkarebellur\\" (Kannada - ‡≤ï‡≥ä‡≤ï‡≥ç‡≤ï‡≤∞‡≥Ü‡≤¨‡≥Ü‡≤≥‡≥ç‡≤≥‡≥Ç‡≤∞‡≥Å) is derived from two words: ‚Äòkokkare‚Äô meaning \\"stork\\" or \\"pelican\\" and ‚Äòbellur‚Äô meaning\\" white village Geography The village is located to the west of the Shimsa River. The area in the vicinity of the village offers large water bodies in the form of several large tanks such as the Tailur Kere (‚ÄòKere‚Äô means \\"tank\\"), the Maddur Kere and the Sole Kere that sustain food needs (particularly, fishes and shellfishes) of the pelicans and other birds. The village setting at Kokkarebellur has nesting trees in the form of Ficus (F religiosa, F bengalensis) and tamarind (Tamarindus indica) trees. The Mandya district, where the village is located, has extensive agricultural fields with sugarcane as a major crop. During the season of migration of birds, large colonies of spot-billed pelicans and painted storks are seen nesting, mostly in tamarind trees. History History of pelicans here was probably mentioned by T C Jerdon in 1853, which was further expanded by the pioneering efforts of the senior forest official S G Neginhal of the Indian Forest Service. In 1976, Neginhal established viable solutions by introducing a compensatory scheme to benefit the villagers for furthering the cause of proliferation of this breed of pelicans. The birds and the villagers have coexisted now in total harmony for several decades. The Karnataka Forest Department compensates the villagers with a fixed sum of money for each tree that is used for nestling by birds, since benefits from the crops (tamarind) from these trees and from the land below the tree are lost. Fauna Apart from the pelicans, the other birds found nestling and breeding in the village trees are the painted stork (Ibis leucocephalus), little cormorant (Phalacrocorax niger), black ibis (Pseudibis papillosa), grey heron (Ardea cinerea), black-crowned night heron (Nycticorax nycticorax) and Indian pond heron (Ardeola grayii). Birds are seen nesting in clusters of 15 to 20 pairs per tree and are thought to use the same tree each year. They arrive after monsoon rains ends in September when the birds create their nests, lay eggs from October to November, thereafter fledge around for three months after laying of eggs, till March and tirelessly feed their hatchlings through the summer season. As summer peaks in May, they re-migrate, year after year, except when they sense drought conditions in their colonial habitat. Village women turning sentimental about the birds returning to their homeland say: > For us, these birds are like a daughter coming home for delivery.... Spot-billed pelican Painted stork The main species that nest in Kokkarebellur ‚Äì the spot-billed pelican (Pelecanus phillipensis) and painted stork (Ibis leucocephalus) are given the conservation status of \\"near threatened category\\" in the IUCN Red List of 2008. The birds have distinctly different large anatomical dimensions and colours but both are very active in feeding and protecting their hatchlings. While the painted stork is large in size, the pelican is half this size. Storks have snow-white plumage, lay 2-5 white dotted eggs and have a yellow tapering bill. The pelicans have grey and grayish white plumage, short stout legs, large webbed feet, flat and enormous bill with an elastic bag of purple skin hanging below the throat (that facilitates to collect fish from water surfaces), with length or height in the range of with tufted crown at the back of the head and lay a maximum of three chalk white eggs at a time. Ring necked parakeets seen in Kokkrebellur In addition to above birds, there are nearly 250 birds recorded around this area over years. Conservation efforts The spot-billed pelicans are protected by law in India and also in several other countries of the region (Sri Lanka, China, Myanmar, Thailand, Cambodia and Laos) to avert threats in the form of tree felling for agricultural purposes. A community-based project has been established to perpetuate historical links of the pelicans with the villagers. Kokkrebellur is not a reserved forest sanctuary but is a small village where the storks and pelicans coexist freely, mostly in tamarind trees in the middle of the village, in total harmony with the villagers. Consequently, reports indicate increased nestling activity in recent years. Thus, efforts to conserve these birds have been fruitful and hailed as a \\"role model\\" for replication at other places. The Karnataka Forest Department (KFD), the Mandya Zilla Panchayath, the Department of Minor Irrigation and Department of Fisheries and the Karnataka State Tourism Development Corporation (KSTDC) have supported the Local Village Level Committee and NGO organizations to conserve and develop all facilities for the birds. The list of planned activities involved cover the following: *Establish and provide grants to the Village Forest Committee (VFC) to protect the birds by nurturing and enhancing the trees (ficus (F. religiosa, F. bengalensis) and tamarind (Tamarindus indica) trees) where the birds nest, collect manure generated by the ‚Äòguano‚Äô or bird droppings of the nestling birds for use by villagers *Encourage tourism to the village for bird watching and thus assist villagers by way of employment as guides, charging of parking fee for vehicles, camera fee, paid toilet, opportunity for running a restaurant or other tourist facilities *Provide incentives to the villagers to compensate for the loss of crops (particularly, from the tamarind trees) *Maintain hygienic environment in the village through establishing adequate water supply and drainage system *Create food sources for the birds in the tanks (reservoirs) in the vicinity of the village by introducing indigenous fish species (banning commercial carp culture), discourage fishing activities and also de-silt the tanks to maintain water in adequate quantity and quality ‚ÄòHejjarle Balaga‚Äô(‡≤π‡≥Ü‡≤ú‡≥ç‡≤ú‡≤æ‡≤∞‡≥ç‡≤≤‡≥Ü ‡≤¨‡≤≥‡≤ó)(meaning \\"relatives of pelican\\") of the Mysore Amateur Naturalists (MAN), an NGO, works in unison with the villagers in providing protection to these birds. The villagers with support from volunteers of the NGOs tend to the injured hatchlings/fledglings that fall from the trees by housing them in exclusively built pens, nurse and feed them with fish caught from nearby water bodies. Its population in southern India, at 21 locations in the states of Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu, is reported to be about 5,000 birds (2006) (its total population in an area of in various countries of Asia is reported in the range of 13,000 - 18,000). Kokrebellur, in particular, has the distinction of increasing its spot-billed pelican population by more than double in recent years. Access It is well connected by road, rail and air transport networks. It is at a distance of from Bangalore on the Bangalore-Mysore highway. The branch road to the village is from the highway at the ‚ÄòCoffee day‚Äô landmark, close to Maddur. It is to the north-east of Mandya. Maddur and Mandya are the closest railway stations on the Mysore-Bangalore broad gauge link. The nearest airport, with daily services to most cities of the country and to some International destinations, is at Bangalore.

Baker, \\"The Moral Limits of Consent as a Defense in the Criminal Law,\\" 12(1) New Criminal Law Review (2009); Dennis J. Baker, The Right Not to be Criminalized: Demarcating Criminal Law's Authority (Ashgate, 2011); see also consensual crime. Defences against criminal liability A defence against criminal liability may arise when a defendant can argue that, because of consent, there was no crime (e.g., arguing that permission was given to use an automobile, so it was not theft or taken without owner's consent). But public policy requires courts to lay down limits on the extent to which citizens are allowed to consent or are to be bound by apparent consent given. As an application of parens patriae, for example, minors cannot consent to having sexual intercourse under a specified age even though the particular instance of statutory rape might be a \\"victimless\\" offense. In the case of adults, there are similar limits imposed on their capacity where the state deems the issue to be of sufficient significance. Thus, for example, an individual domiciled in a common law state cannot give consent and create a valid second marriage. The second ceremony will do no more than expose the prospective spouse to a charge of bigamy. Similarly, no consent can be given for an incestuous relationship nor for relationships that expose one of the parties to excessive violence (e.g. most states have a rule that an abusive husband can be prosecuted even if the wife does not co-operate and give evidence to rebut the husband's defense that the wife consented). In English law, the Sexual Offences Act 2003 removes the element of consent from the actus reus of many offences, so that only the act itself and the age or other constraints need to be proved, including: Most states have laws which criminalize misrepresentations, deceptions, and fraud. These are situations in which a victim may have given apparent consent to parting with ownership or possession of money and/or goods, or to generally suffering a loss, but this consent is treated as vitiated by the dishonesty of the person making the untrue representations. Thus, while the criminal law is not generally a means of escaping civil obligations, the criminal courts may be able to offer some assistance to the gullible by returning their property or making compensation orders. Consensual activity The problem has always been to decide at what level the victim's consent becomes ineffective. Historically in the UK, the defense was denied when the injuries caused amounted to a maim (per Hawkins' Pleas of the Crown (8th ed.) 1824). In R v Donovan (1934) AER 207 in which Swift J. stated the general rule that: However, consent is valid in a range of circumstances, including contact sports (such as boxing or mixed martial arts), as well as tattooing and piercing. But in the context of sadomasochism, Lord Mustill in R v Brown (1993)2 All ER, page 103 has set the level just below actual bodily harm. R v Wilson (1996), which involved a case where a husband branded his wife's buttocks, upheld that consent can be a valid defence. The act was considered comparable to tattooing, whilst Brown applied specifically to sadomasochism. The issue of consent in the course of sado- masochistic sexual activity was considered in R v Stein (2007), a case in which a participant died as a result of being gagged. The court held that, even if the victim had consented to a being restrained and gagged, his consent was invalid because there was no way for him to communicate its withdrawal once the gag was in his mouth.. For sado-masochism, R v Boyea (1992) 156 JPR 505 was another application of the ratio decidendi in Donovan that even if she had actually consented to injury by allowing the defendant to put his hand into her vagina and twist it, causing internal and external injuries to her vagina and bruising on her pubis, the woman's consent (if any) would have been irrelevant. The court took judicial notice of the change in social attitudes to sexual matters, but \\"the extent of the violence inflicted‚Ä¶ went far beyond the risk of minor injury to which, if she did consent, her consent would have been a defence\\". In R v Brown, the House of Lords rejected the defense on public policy grounds (see below). This is an application of the general rule that, once an actus reus with an appropriate mens rea has been established, no defense can be admitted, but the evidence may be admitted to mitigate the sentence. This decision was confirmed in the ECHR in Laskey v United Kingdom (1997) 24 EHRR 39 on the basis that although the prosecution might have constituted an interference with the private lives of those involved, it was justified for the protection of public health. In R v Emmett (unreported, 18 June 1999), as part of their consensual sexual activity, the woman allowed her partner to cover her head with a plastic bag, tying it tightly at the neck. On a different occasion, she agreed that he could pour fuel from a lighter onto her breasts and set fire to the fuel. On the first occasion, she was at risk of death, and lost consciousness. On the second, she suffered burns, which became infected. The court applied Brown and ruled that the woman's consent to these events did not provide a defence for her partner. The general rule, therefore, is that violence involving the deliberate and intentional infliction of bodily harm is and remains unlawful notwithstanding that its purpose is the sexual gratification of one or both participants. Notwithstanding their sexual overtones, these cases are considered to be violent crimes and it is not an excuse that one partner consents. Maouloud Baby v. State of Maryland was a 2007 case in the Maryland Court of Appeals, the state's highest court, which determined that a person may withdraw sexual consent after having given it, and that the continuation of sexual activity after the withdrawal of consent constitutes rape. Alzheimer's disease or similar disabilities may result in a person being unable to give legal consent to sexual relations even with their spouse. Ability to consent According to Rule 70 of the Rules of Procedure and Evidence (published in 2002) of the International Criminal Court (which rules on military conflicts between states), in cases of sexual violence: In Australia, if a sexual partner was asleep, unconscious or a jury decides that a complainant was unable to consent, sexual contact is considered rape. In New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia, Tasmania and the Northern Territory, consent is not possible when the complainant was asleep or unconscious. In Victoria, South Australia, Tasmania and the Northern Territory, there is no consent where the complainant is so affected by alcohol or other drugs as \\"to be incapable of freely agreeing\\" to the sexual activity. In the Australian Capital Territory, the effect of alcohol or other drugs is less qualified; there is no consent if it is caused by \\"the effect of intoxicating liquor, a drug or anaesthetic\\". In NSW, there may be no consent where a complainant was \\"substantially intoxicated by alcohol or any drug\\". This formulation adopts the view expressed in the 2010 Family Violence ‚Äì A National Legal Response report of the Criminal Justice Sexual Offences Taskforce and Australian Law Reform Commission that the degree of intoxication and whether it was such that a person was \\"unable to consent\\" are matters for the jury. Consent obtained by deception In R v Clarence (1888) 22 QBD 23, at a time when the defendant knew that he was suffering from a venereal disease, he had sexual intercourse and communicated the disease to his wife. Had she been aware, she would not have submitted to the intercourse. The defendant was convicted of inflicting grievous bodily harm contrary to section 20 of the Offences against the Person Act 1861. On appeal the conviction was quashed. Mr Justice Willis said \\"...that consent obtained by fraud is no consent at all is not true as a general proposition either in fact or in law. Mr Justice Stephens had said (at p. 44) \\"...the only sorts of fraud which so far destroy the effect of a woman's consent as to convert a connection consented to in fact into a rape are frauds as to the nature of the act itself, or as to the identity of the person who does the act. Consent in such cases does not exist at all because the act consented to is not the act done. Until recently, the case has never been challenged, but its current status was complicated by the then general assumptions that \\"infliction\\" required some act of violence, and that non- physical injuries could not be inflicted and so were outside the scope of the Offences Against the Person Act. Now the ruling in R v Chan-Fook [1994] 1 WLR 689, which held that psychiatric injury could be actual bodily harm, has been confirmed by the House of Lords in R v Burstow, R v Ireland [1998] 1 Cr App R 177. These cases overrule the implicit ratio decidendi of Clarence that non- physical injuries can be injuries within the scope of the Offences Against the Person Act and without the need to prove a physical application of violence, Lord Steyn describing Clarence as a \\"troublesome authority\\", and, in the specific context of the meaning of \\"inflict\\" in section 20, said expressly that Clarence \\"no longer assists\\". This left the issue of fraud. In R v Linekar [1995] QB 250, a prostitute stated the fact that she would not have consented to sexual intercourse if she had known that her client was not intending to pay, but there was no fraud-induced consent as to the nature of the activity, nor was the identity of the client relevant. In R v Richardson [1998] 2 Cr App R 200, the patient believed that she was receiving dental treatment which otherwise would have given rise to an assault occasioning actual bodily harm, from a dentist who had in fact been struck off the register. The Court held that the identity of the defendant was not a feature which, in that case, precluded the giving of consent by the patient. In R v Navid Tabassum (May, 2000) the three complainant women agreed to the appellant showing them how to examine their own breasts. That involved the appellant, himself, feeling the breasts of two of the women and using a stethoscope beneath the bra of the third woman. Each of the three women said that they had only consented because they thought the appellant had either medical qualifications or relevant training. He had neither. There was no evidence of any sexual motive. He was convicted on the basis that the complainants had only consented to acts medical in nature and not to indecent behaviour, that is, there was consent to the nature of the act but not its quality. In R v Cort [2003] 3 WLR 1300, a case of kidnapping, the complainants had consented to taking a ride in a car, but not to being kidnapped. They wanted transport, not kidnapping. Kidnapping may be established by carrying away by fraud. \\"It is difficult to see how one could ever consent to that once fraud was indeed established. The 'nature' of the act here is therefore taking the complainant away by fraud. The complainant did not consent to that event. All that she consented to was a ride in the car, which in itself is irrelevant to the offence and a different thing from that with which Mr Cort is charged\\". A paper on the website The Student Lawyer examined the basis for fraud as grounds for negating consent, in the context of the decision not to charge officers involved in the UK undercover policing relationships scandal. It concluded that the issues which might arise if this was a legal basis to negate consent, could be far wider than might be first appreciated. Examples given by the author included: Sexual transmission of disease In 1998, the Home Office issued a consultation paper entitled Violence: Reforming the Offences Against the Person Act 1861 rejecting the Law Commission's recommendation that there should be offences for the intentional or reckless transmission of disease. The Government \\"[was] particularly concerned that the law should not seem to discriminate against those who are HIV positive, have AIDS or viral Hepatitis or who carry any kind of disease\\". It did, however, accept that society should have criminal sanctions for use against \\"evil acts\\", and that this might include people who transmitted diseases causing serious illness to others with intent to do them such harm, adding that \\"this aims to strike a sensible balance between allowing very serious intentional acts to be punished while not rendering individuals liable for prosecution of unintentional or reckless acts or for the transmission of minor disease\\" (see paras 3.13-318) In 2000, the government repeated that view in a consultation relating to the law on manslaughter, \\"The Government remains wholly committed to this approach.\\" This has since been considered in R. v Dica, which deals with the transmission of HIV, holding that it was not necessary to prove that the transmission had involved an assault for the \\"inflicting\\" of the disease. The judgment rejects the rule in Clarence as tainted by the then presumption of a wife's marital consent to sexual intercourse, although Clarence was still being applied after the criminalisation of rape within marriage. The more modern authorities involving the transmission of psychological conditions and in other sexual matters, reject the notion that consent can be a defence to anything more than a trivial injury. Yet this is not without its difficulties. If it is proposed to criminalise the consensual taking of risks of infection by having unprotected sexual intercourse, enforcement is impractical. The community prefers that sexual relationships are a private matter between the individuals involved and if adults were suddenly to be liable to prosecution for taking known risks with their health, this would represent a significant interference with personal autonomy. Further, the law cannot expect people suddenly to become honest with each other and to counsel the use of condoms, and there may be negative consequences if HIV was to be disclosable, because those who ought to take medical advice and undergo tests, might be discouraged from doing so. Consequently, the Appeal Court decided that had the women known of his infection, their consent to unprotected sexual intercourse would have been a valid defence. In this regard, they overturned the ruling of the original judge. In R. v Konzani, the defence argued that by consenting to unprotected sexual intercourse with the defendant, the women were impliedly consenting to all the risks associated with sexual intercourse which included infection with HIV. In cross-examination two of the three women had explicitly acknowledged that, in general, unprotected sexual intercourse carried a risk of infection. However the Appeal Court judges ruled that before the complainants' consent could provide the appellant with a defence, it had to be an informed and willing consent to the specific risk, here the risk of contracting HIV, rather than the general one of contracting something. The same court held that a person accused of recklessly transmitting an STI could only raise the defense of consent, including an honest belief in consent, in cases where that consent was a \\"willing\\" or \\"conscious\\" consent. In other words, the court distinguished between \\"willingly running the risk of transmission\\" and \\"willingly consenting to the risk of transmission.\\" This suggests that consent will only operate as a defensein all but the most exceptional of caseswhere there has already been prior disclosure of known HIV positive status. Judge LJ. summaries the situation at para 42: In the public interest, so far as possible, the spread of catastrophic illness must be avoided or prevented. On the other hand, the public interest also requires that the principle of personal autonomy in the context of adult non-violent sexual relationships should be maintained. If an individual who knows that he is suffering from HIV conceals this stark fact from his sexual partner, the principle of her personal autonomy is not enhanced if he is exculpated when he recklessly transmits HIV to her through consensual sexual intercourse. On any view, the concealment of this fact from her almost inevitably means that she is deceived. Her consent is not properly informed, and she cannot give an informed consent to something of which she is ignorant. Equally, her personal autonomy is not normally protected by allowing a defendant who knows that he is suffering from HIV which he deliberately conceals, to assert an honest belief in his partner's informed consent to the risk of the transmission of HIV. Silence in these circumstances is incongruous with honesty, or with a genuine belief that there is an informed consent. Accordingly, in such circumstances the issue either of informed consent, or honest belief in it will only rarely arise: in reality, in most cases, the contention would be wholly artificial. Baker (2009) in \\"Moral Limits of Consent\\" 12(1) New Criminal Law Review argues even if the consent in Konzani was genuine, that it like Brown was rightly decided, as Baker is of the view that a person cannot consent to irreparable harm of a grave kind without also degrading his or her humanity in the Kantian sense. Baker also argues that the Harm Principle provides an important constraint, as it prevents the consenter from being criminalized because it is only harm to others that is criminalisable under the Harm Principle‚Äînot harm to self. Therefore, it is only those who rely on consent to inflict grave harm on their fellow humans that are criminalized under Baker's proposals. However, Baker points out that R v. Brown is more borderline, as the harm in that case was reversible and is not too different from having unnecessary plastic surgery that is no longer benefiting the patient‚Äîthat is numerous surgical procedures which are clearly having a disfiguring rather than beneficial cosmetic effect. Preventing breaches of the peace In R v Coney (1882) 8 QBD 534, members of the public who attended an illegal prize fight in a public place were convicted of aiding and abbetting an assault. They were cheering on the boxers whose conduct was likely to and did produce a breach of the peace, so any mutual consent given by the fighters was vitiated by the public nature of the entertainment irrespective of the degree of injury caused or intended. Hence, the principal offence was committed and, since it would not have taken place had there been no crowd to bet and support the fighters, the secondary parties were also liable. Consent as an effective defense In properly regulated sport, there is a legal right to cause incidental injury. This is a criminal law version of the civil law principle volenti non fit injuria (Latin for consent does not make an [actionable] injury) and the victim consents to run the risk (not the certainty) of injury arising within the rules of the game being played. This does not give sport a license to enact rules permitting acts that are clearly, excessively and maliciously violent. Even professional sport should have an element of fun while the players are, in the more extreme cases, given criminal as well as civil law protection (see R v Johnson (1986) 8 Cr App R (S) 343 and R v Lloyd (1989) CLR 513 dealing with injuries inflicted on the rugby field in \\"off the ball\\" incidents). Thus, the consent in licensed boxing events is to intentional harm within the rules and a blow struck between rounds would be an assault. Horseplay Where the culture supports the playing of practical jokes and active physical interaction as a form of \\"fun\\", those who become a part of that culture must accept the local standards of contact and the injuries that might result. Thus, in R v Aitken and Others [1992] 1 WLR 1006, the victim was a serving member of the Royal Air Force and the fact that he had participated in practical jokes played on his companions was accepted as evidence that he had consented to become a victim when it was \\"his turn\\". Legal right to cause, or consent to, injury * Doctors and all health professionals have a general right to assume a patient's consent for necessary treatment (per Denning LJ in Bravery v Bravery (1954) 3 AER 59). So if a person is brought into a hospital unconscious, surgery to preserve life will not be unlawful. But, if the health authorities have actual notice that the patient does not consent, even necessary treatment will be unlawful unless either it becomes urgently necessary to take action to avoid death, or consent is given either by a spouse or relative, or by a court. There have been cases, for example, where it was not to be an assault for prison hospitals for force- feed a prisoner on hunger strike, but such cases are not of general application. When in doubt, consent should be sought from the courts. In any event, treatment will only be lawful if it is of therapeutic rather than cosmetic value. Similarly, tattooing, ear piercing and other cosmetic procedures will be lawful if there is actual consent. * Parents and others who are in loco parentis have a limited right to administer reasonable parental punishment: see A v UK (1998) CLR 892 and H (2002) 1 Cr. App. R. 59, but teachers are prohibited from administering corporal punishment: s548 Education Act 1996: Williams v Secretary of State for Education and Employment (2005) 2 All ER 1. * In the UK, in Operation Spanner, three men who consensually agreed to engage in consensual sadomasochism, were convicted of assault occasioning actual bodily harm. The resulting House of Lords case (R v Brown, colloquially known as \\"the Spanner case\\") ruled that consent was not a valid legal defence for wounding and actual bodily harm in the UK, except as a foreseeable incident of a lawful activity in which the person injured was participating, e.g. surgery. The convictions are seen as controversialS Bottomley & S Bronitt, Law in Context (3rd ed, Sydney: The Federation Press, 2006), Chapter 11.http://www.stjosephs.s-tyneside.sch.uk/resources/Law/lawExtraReading/A2/Unit5/Consent.doc due to issues of whether a government or one's self is justified to control one's own body in private situations where the only harm may be temporary, and to volunteering adults who gave informed consent to the types of acts involved.

They may be either regular issues that just happen to be printed in small groups (typical of many early stamps), or special issues often commemorating some event, such as a national anniversary, philatelic exhibition, or government program. The number of stamps ranges from one to about 25; larger sheets of stamps are simply called \\"sheets\\" with no qualifier. The stamps on the sheet may be perforated in the usual way, or imperforate. The margins or selvage of the sheet may have additional printing, ranging from a simple statement of the occasion being commemorated, up to a full picture of which the stamp(s) are just a small part. The margins of the sheet may have ornamental designs, price, emblems and logo(s) which are not the part of stamp(s). Stamps on the miniature sheet can be in se-tenant position while the same stamps were not se-tenants in regular issue. Both the stamps and the entire sheet are valid for mailing, although they are almost always sold above face value and kept in mint collection by collectors; a handful of usages may be found as philatelic covers. Luxembourg issued the first generally recognized souvenir sheet in 1923, a single 10-franc stamp, not otherwise available, inset in a larger blank sheet. The purpose was to honor the birth of Princess Elisabeth. However, this country had produced a somewhat similar issue in 1921, a small sheet of 5 stamps to celebrate the birth of Prince Jean, and an even earlier sheet of 10 stamps for the accession of William IV in 1906.Souvenir sheets are a little hard to define Neither had margin inscriptions and both consisted of regular issue stamps that were otherwise available.Commemorative Sheets - Notes Since the 1920s many other countries have produced souvenir sheets. The United States issued its first one in 1926, and printed several more in the 1930s, with new ones occasionally issued since that time. Starting in 1955 the United Nations has occasionally produced them. While some of the earliest souvenir sheets are valuable (for instance in excellent condition the US White Plains sheet of 1926 is worth hundreds of dollars), modern ones are typically produced in considerable quantities and have no special value.

She was arrested in February 1995 in connection with the 1994 Zapatista uprising. In 1996, the Mexican government acknowledged it was a wrongful arrest and acquitted her of all charges.Human Rights Watch: \\"Torture and Other Abuses During the 1995 Crackdown on Alleged Zapatistas.\\" Vol 8. No. 3 (B) Mexico, February 1996 Today, she is a professor at the Autonomous University of Social Movements (part of the Mexican Solidarity Network).  Radical beginnings and the FLN (1970s)  Benavides studied at the Faculty of Medicine from 1971 to 1972, where she was exposed to leftist ideas converging from multiple radical currents, particularly Juventud Comunista de M√©xico (Communist Youth of Mexico), Liga Leninista Espartaco (Spartacus Leninist League), and Obra Cultural Universitaria (University Cultural Work). According to H√©ctor Escamilla Lira, a prominent guerilla in the Liga Comunista 23 de Septiembre (September 23 Communist League), one of the reasons left-wing movements thrived during this time was the lack of repression in the late 1960s and early 70s. He notes that ‚Äúthe anti-communist fury broke out later, with the arrival of [Nuevo Le√≥n governor] Alfonso Mart√≠nez Dom√≠nguez.\\" This period of political freedom allowed the teenage Benavides to come of age as a budding radical leader. From this point on, she was deeply involved in Mexico's revolutionary movements, one of which would eventually win out: the Zapatista.Proceso: \\"Germ√°n' and 'Elisa,' Seen from Their Roots in Nuevo Leon.\\" July 24, 1995. The 1970s saw Benavides join the FLN (National Liberation Forces), the foremost radical group in Mexico since its founding in 1969. The FLN is widely considered to be a precursor to the Zapatista Army of National Liberation (EZLN). Both groups had a radical leftist ideology and a desire to actively combat the exploitation of indigenous Mexicans. Benavides was first arrested in 1974 during a house raid, during which she also lost her husband. After her release, she rejoined the movement, only to lose her second husband and infant daughter in another military raid.  Zapatista involvement (1983-1996)  In the early 1980s, Benavides took on a more significant leadership role in the movement. She was among the non-indigenous members of the FLN who founded the EZLN on November 17, 1983. FLN leader C√©sar Germ√°n Y√°√±ez Mu√±oz gathered six revolutionaries (three indigenous, three non- indigenous) at a camp called La Garrapata to establish a more action-based initiative.Exc√©lsior: \\"The Guerrilla Is Fractured in Chiapas; FLN Breaks with the EZLN.\\" March 16, 2019. Exc√©lsior: \\"Marcos' women: actresses, nuns, peasants, politicians, guerrillas.\\" May 26, 2017. In an interview with Radio UNAM (National Autonomous University of Mexico) in 1994, Benavides commented on her reasons for joining and remaining with the Zapatista army: \\"I entered there because I saw the situation that people lived. So I thought about how to solve this problem, because I didn't know if there are companions in the mountains. But when they told me that there is a group of comrades who are fighting for the people, then one day the insurgent comrades came down in the village, that's when they explained to me what they wanted, why they fought.\\"Center for Zapatista Documents (Centro de Documentaci√≥n sobre Zapatismo): \\"The situation of women: Interview with Captain Elisa.\\" 1994. Much of Benavides' activism after 1983 involved working as a translator for indigenous groups in the small villages of Chiapas, particularly in the Lacandon Jungle. At this point in time, the EZLN was devoting considerable resources to its social work in Chiapas, including health and education programs otherwise unavailable to the marginalized indigenous population. All decisions were made in tandem with indigenous councils in the individual regions.El Pa√≠s: \\"Subcomandante Elisa recalls two decades of political struggle from prison.\\" February 21, 1995. This practice was in keeping with the EZLN's larger goal: to produce, through a sort of peaceful vigilantism, the conditions that were necessary for the continuous reproduction of identity and sovereignty in civil society The movement itself was heavily influenced by the Italian Marxist philosopher Antonio Gramsci, who emphasized the necessity of forming a \\"collective will,\\" or \\"the attainment of a cultural-social unity through which a multiplicity of dispersed wills, with heterogeneous aims, are welded together with a single aim, on the basis of an equal and common conception of the world, both general and particular.\\"Olesen, Thomas (2006). Latin American Social Movements. Lanham, Maryland: Rowman & Littlefield Publishers, Inc. p. 187. This is the first step in constructing an alternative historical bloc to the one put forth by the ruling class, which he believes is the key to inverting hegemony and beginning to dismantle an oppressive state. Later on, the EZLN developed larger ambitions than the social services they had been providing. Its leader, Subcomandante Marcos (Rafael Sebasti√°n Guill√©n at the time; currently Subcomandante Galeano), altered the nature of the Zapatistas' work as part of his plan to build an \\"indigenous substrate guerrilla\\" in Chiapas. Instruction in first aid and radio communications prepared residents to mobilize, and special military training was taught to EZLN leaders by Sandinista Army commander Lenin Serna. Benavides was among them.El Mundo: \\"The True Story of Subcomandante Marcos.\\" February 2, 1995. Feminist beliefs Benavides was a staunch believer in gender equality. She viewed the Zapatista movement as uniquely progressive in gender relations, with men and women collaborating at all levels. This stood in contrast to dominant social norms in Mexico at the time. Benavides expressed her frustration at the systematic sexism that was present everywhere but within the bounds of the Zapatista camp: \\"In the Zapatista army, men and women get along. There is democracy, there is justice, there is everything there...[W]e live together with men and do the same work....That is what we are looking for right now. Because as a peasant woman the government does not recognize us. The woman is always down and the man is always the boss, but right now we see that what the government says is not true. Women can also do the jobs, they can also take charge, they can also lead the same as men, that's why we are fighting so that women also have that opportunity to do those jobs.\\" This sentiment is in keeping with a larger current in Latin American social justice movements. As Gavin O'Toole writes in his book on Latin American politics, \\"The prominence of women in EZLN affairs has led some to suggest that while it is not a feminist movement, it is a feminine movement. Other women have argued that a distinct form of ‚Äòindigenous feminism‚Äô exists in places like southern Mexico where women struggle to draw on and navigate feminist ideologies while attempting to preserve and reclaim indigenous traditions.\\"Gavin O'Toole: \\"Politics Latin America.\\" 2007 Women in the Zapatista movement are known for their commitment to feminist action in addition to their fight against class struggle and indigenous exploitation. They spearheaded the campaign for the EZLN to adopt a \\"Women's Revolutionary Law,\\" an unequivocal proclamation of gender equality for the movement going forward. Whether Benevides directly contributed to the development and publication of this statement is unknown, but given her position in the revolutionary leadership as well as her public statements, there is little doubt that she would have supported the law.  Arrest, release, and acquittal (1995-1996)  In the early 1990s, Benavides moved to Mexico City with her husband Javier Elorriaga Berdegue, whom she met through the Zapatista movement. She became a professor at the Autonomous University of Social Movements and continued activist work through her channels there. However, there is some dispute as to whether she was still a member of the Zapatista army at this time. Some sources say she quit the movement before 1988, and her family questioned her ability to lead a guerrilla movement while pregnant and as a new mother, but in the 1994 Radio UNAM interview, she describes herself as a Zapatista soldier. Finally, in an interview with El Pa√≠s in 1995, she professed that while she was no longer part of the guerrilla movement, she wanted ‚Äúto participate in the consultation, nationally and internationally, devised by the Zapatista leaders about their future.‚ÄùEl Pa√≠s: \\"Provisional Freedom in Mexico for the 'Subcomandante Elisa' of the EZLN.\\" July 15, 1995. This has been her public stance since then. On February 8, 1995, the Mexican police raided Benavides' house in Mexico City and arrested her and Elorriaga, who was also a revolutionary.Human Rights Watch: \\"Torture and Other Abuses During the 1995 Crackdown on Alleged Zapatistas.\\" Vol 8. No. 3 (B) Mexico, February 1996 Accessed April 1, 2016. A formal prison order was issued by the Attorney General of the Republic accusing her of terrorism, criminal association, rebellion and possession of prohibited weapons. An amparo was granted in regards to the allegations of terrorism and criminal association after Benavides' attorney argued that the prison order \\"[did] not conform to the provisions of article 19 of the Constitution,\\"‚Äîthere was insufficient evidence to prove Benavides' involvement in that specific uprising. During the proceedings, she claimed that her initial confession of guilt was induced by psychological torture. This was key to the defense's amparo win, but further complicates the discussion of her membership, because of the abundant source material that suggests she acted on her own will. The charges of rebellion and illegal weapon possession were upheld, but deemed minor enough that Benavides could be released on bail. Later, the neighborhood incident that provoked the investigation of Benavides' house was found to have been fabricated, and the insurrectionist documents the Attorney General claimed she possessed were revealed to be common political literature owned by much of the population. She was acquitted of all charges on November 1, 1996. Her arrest and its aftermath were widely considered to be politically motivated, especially as she was only one of seventeen people to be arrested around that time in conjunction with the 1994 uprising.Viento de Libertad - Los saldos de la represi√≥n por motivos pol√≠ticos en M√©xico: \\"Benavides, Mar√≠a Gloria (Elisa)\\".

While not an official member of the Zapatista army anymore, she remains a proponent of equal rights and provisions for indigenous groups in Chiapas.

In 1903 he helped promote the Rochet-Schneider Company by driving a car from London to Moscow non-stop. He also drove a Martini up a mountain rock railway near Montreux, Switzerland. At this time H H P Deasy and Co., was formed to import both Rochet-Schneider and Martini cars into the UK. In 1906 The Deasy Motor Car Manufacturing Co. was formed, and took over the factory formerly used by the Iden Car Co. at Parkside, Coventry. In 9 March 1908 Deasy resigned, after a dispute with the car's designer Edmund W Lewis. In 1913, as a member of the council of the Roads Improvement Association, he formulated a scheme for a standard type of direction post and plate for adoption by highway authorities.

Short illustration of the puncturing procedure. In some cases, a pre-defined pattern of puncturing is used in an encoder. Then, the inverse operation, known as depuncturing, is implemented by the decoder. Puncturing is used in UMTS during the rate matching process.

The neighborhood houses plush homes and mansions of Bangalore's famous celebrities and industrialists. History Sadashivanagar was created out of the former royal gardens, and is home to one of the original four towers built in 1597 by Kempe Gowda I, the founder of the city. In the 1960s and early 1970s, the gardens of the Bangalore Palace (a summer home of the Wodeyar dynasty of Mysore) were converted into a residential neighborhood, and this was when the first lots in Sadashivnagar were purchased. Until the 1990s, Sadashivnagar was known as \\"Palace Orchards,\\" as it was built in the former royal grounds. It was renamed in honor of Karnad Sadashiva Rao, a freedom fighter and philanthropist. Even today, homes in the Raj Mahal Vilas Extension (built in the wing formerly known as Upper Palace Orchards) are situated right opposite what is left of the official palace grounds. Many highly placed government officials, ex- governors, film stars and millionaire businessmen have bought homes in the neighborhood. The neighborhood is also home to various Wodeyar royals. Culture Along with the adjacent older, neighborhood of Malleswaram, the atmosphere in Sadashivanagar is Old Bangalore and therefore somewhat different from Bangalore's customary stereotype as a young, modern, and contemporary city. The majority of the residents come from old families and try to preserve tradition and heritage. Until the mid-2000s, it was the custom in Sadashivanagar to shun ostentatious displays of wealth and cultivate unassuming, modest manners. This culture is typical of old Bangalore society. However, such qualities are slowly changing as new families from different backgrounds move into the neighborhood. Present boundary The Sadashivanagar area runs from Mehkri Circle in the north to Bashyam Circle a little way south. A less expensive area once known as Lower Palace Orchards spills over and partially surrounds the Bashyam Circle. Sadashivanagar borders the Sankey Tank, a midsized lake on the edge of which are several large homes. A trail runs along the circumference of the lake and is sometimes used by residents for exercise. To reduce pollution of the natural water bodies, the Civic Authority has constructed an artificial tank for immersion of Ganesha during the famous Ganesha Chathurthi festival.

They are designated as a Grade I listed building. During the Georgian era Bath became fashionable, and the architects John Wood, the Elder, and his son laid out new areas of housing for residents and visitors. Assembly rooms had been built early in the 18th century, but a new venue for balls, concerts and gambling was envisaged in the area between Queen Square, The Circus and the Royal Crescent. Robert Adam submitted a proposal that was rejected as too expensive. John Wood, the Younger raised funding through a tontine, and construction started in 1769. The new or upper assembly rooms opened with a grand ball in 1771 and became the hub of fashionable society, being frequented by Jane Austen and Charles Dickens, along with the nobility of the time. The building, made of Bath stone, is arranged in a U shape. There are four main function rooms in the complex: the ballroom ‚Äî the largest Georgian interior in Bath; the tea room; the card room; and the octagon. The rooms have Whitefriars crystal chandeliers and are decorated with fine art. In the 20th century they were used as a cinema and in 1931 were taken over by the Society for the Protection of Ancient Buildings and restored. They were bombed and burnt out during the Second World War, with restoration undertaken by Sir Albert Richardson before reopening in 1963. They are now owned by the National Trust and operated by Bath and North East Somerset Council for public functions. The basement of the building provides a home to the Fashion Museum. History Several areas of Bath had undergone development during the Stuart period; development increased during Georgian times, however, in response to the increasing number of visitors to the spa and resort town who required accommodation. The architects John Wood the Elder and his son John Wood the Younger laid out the new quarters in streets and squares, the identical fa√ßades of which gave an impression of palatial scale and classical decorum. Much of the creamy honey-coloured Bath stone used for construction throughout the city was obtained from the limestone Combe Down and Bathampton Down Mines owned by Ralph Allen (1694‚Äì1764). The development at this time largely consisted of new residential areas located away from the old city centre. The elder John Wood designed Queen Square, the Circus, and Gay Street in 1735, which would be completed by the younger John Wood. Queen Square was the first speculative development by the elder John Wood, who lived in one of the houses. The Circus consists of three long, curved terraces that form a circular theatre intended for civic functions and games and inspired by the Colosseum in Rome. Finally the elder Wood also designed and developed Gay Street which links the two; the buildings on Gay Street are now largely Grade I listed buildings. The most spectacular of Bath's terraces is the Royal Crescent, designed by the younger John Wood, and built between 1767 and 1774. The heart of the Georgian city was Wood's Pump Room, which, together with its associated Lower Assembly Rooms, was designed by Thomas Baldwin, a local builder responsible for many other buildings in the city, including the terraces in Argyle Street and the Guildhall, The Lower Assembly Rooms consisted of two buildings. The first built in 1708 for Thomas Harrison overlooking Parade Gardens between North Parade and Bath Abbey. A large ballroom was added in 1720, with further enlargement in 1749 and 1810 when it became known as The Kingston Assembly Rooms. In 1728 another building, known as Lindsey's Assembly Rooms, was constructed, lasting until demolition around 1820 for the building of York Street. Harrison's Lower Assembly Rooms were devastated by a fire in December 1820 Taunton Courier 27 December 1820 and rebuilt, lasting until demolition in 1933 for road improvements on the site now known as \\"Bog Island\\". Fancy Dress Ball at the Bath Assembly Rooms by Thomas Rowlandson In around 1770 the neoclassical architect Robert Adam designed Pulteney Bridge, a three-arched bridge spanning the River Avon. He used as his prototype an original, but unused, design by Andrea Palladio for the Rialto Bridge in Venice. Adam also submitted plans for the new Assembly Rooms but these were rejected as too costly. John Wood, the Younger raised funding for the construction of the Assembly Rooms by the use of a Tontine, an investment plan that is named after the Neapolitan banker Lorenzo de Tonti, who is credited with inventing it in France in 1653. It combines features of a group annuity and a lottery. Each subscriber pays an agreed sum into the fund, and thereafter receives an annuity. As members die, their shares devolve to the other participants, and so the value of each annuity increases. On the death of the last member, the scheme is wound up. Construction started in 1769 and was completed in 1771, when a grand opening was held. The Assembly Rooms formed the hub of fashionable Georgian society in the city, the venue being described as \\"the most noble and elegant of any in the kingdom\\". They were originally known as the Upper Rooms as there was also a lower assembly room in the city, which closed soon after the Upper Rooms opened. They served the newly built fashionable area which included the Circus, Queen Square and the Royal Crescent. Entrance into the Octagon Room People would gather in the rooms in the evening for balls and other public functions, or simply to play cards. Mothers and chaperones bringing their daughters to Bath for the social season, hoping to marry them off to a suitable husband, would take their charge to such events where, very quickly, one might meet all the eligible men currently in the City. At one concert in 1779, attended by around 800 ladies and gentlemen, 60 members of the nobility were present. During the season, which ran from October to June, at least two balls a week were held, in addition to a range of concerts and other events. Scenes such as this feature in the novels of Jane Austen, who lived in Bath with her parents and sister from 1801 to 1805. Her two novels set in Bath, Northanger Abbey and Persuasion, were published in 1818 and both mention the Assembly Rooms: 1837 Steel engraving, probably by Hablot Knight Browne, \\"The Card-room at Bath\\" used in The Pickwick Papers Charles Dickens also visited Bath on several occasions. He gave public readings in the Assembly Rooms and mentions them in The Pickwick Papers (published in 1837): George Bridgetower, an Afro-Polish- born virtuoso violinist, made his debut at the Assembly Rooms in 1789. Another young violinist, Thomas Linley the younger, played a series of concerts between 1771 and 1776. Many of the concerts during the late 18th and early 19th centuries were organised by Venanzio Rauzzini. In the 20th century several changes took place, with the Ballroom becoming a cinema, until the Society for the Protection of Ancient Buildings became the owners in 1931. The building was restored by A Mowbray Green in 1938, with Oliver Messel as the interior designer. During the Bath Blitz of 25/26 April 1942, one of the retaliatory raids on England by the Baedeker Blitz following the RAF's raid on L√ºbeck, the Assembly Rooms were bombed and burnt out inside. After the cessation of hostilities in Europe, they were restored by Sir Albert Richardson, with work being completed in 1963. The ballroom ceiling had to be repaired after it collapsed in 1989. Architecture Three chandeliers adorning the Tea Room The limestone building has a slate hipped roof. It is rectangular with a projecting doric portico entrance and an extension to the rear. The interior is laid out in a U shape, with the larger Ball Room and Tea Room along either side with the octagonal Card Room at the end. The rooms have Whitefriars crystal chandeliers and are decorated with pictures by Thomas Gainsborough, Allan Ramsay (artist), Edwin Long and William Hoare. The Ballroom has five chandeliers and capacity for up to 500 people. It is over long and nearly wide. The ceiling is high. The Tea Room holds up to 250 people. It was the location for a banquet attended by The Prince of Wales for the BBC television series the Great British Menu. It is long and wide. The Octagon is named for the shape of the room has four fireplaces. It is across. It originally held an organ in the musicians gallery. In 1777 the Card Room was added. This is now used as a bar. Current use The Octagon Room, with a central chandelier Today the rooms are owned by the National Trust and operated by Bath and North East Somerset Council. The main rooms are still available for hire for private functions. They are also used for concerts, including ones that are part of the Bath International Music Festival. The basement of the building provides a home to the Fashion Museum, which was known before 2007 as the Museum of Costume. The collection was started by Doris Langley Moore, who gave her collection to the city of Bath in 1963. It focuses on fashionable dress for men, women and children from the late 16th century to the present day and has more than 30,000 objects. The earliest pieces are embroidered shirts and gloves from about 1600. The grandeur of the building make it a popular location for feature films and television series set in the Georgian period. The BBC have used it as a location for the filming of an adaptation of Northanger Abbey in 1986 and in 1995 Persuasion.

Wydawnictwo Literackie) Cover by Jacek Stok≈Çosa Golem XIV is a book written by Polish author Stanis≈Çaw Lem, published in 1981. It is a philosophical essay in the format of science fiction, presented as a part of the lecture course given by a superintelligent computer, Golem XIV. It contains two lectures, together with an introduction, a foreword, a memo, and an afterword, all of them being fictitious. The first part (up to the first lecture) was first published in the collection Wielko≈õƒá urojona in 1973, which in 1985 was translated in English by Harvest Books as Imaginary Magnitude. The translation included the complete Golem XIV. Book summary=Overview and structure The foreword is \\"written\\" by an Irving T. Creve, dated by 2027. It contains a summary of the (fictional) history of the militarization of computers by The Pentagon which pinnacled in Golem XIV, as well as comments on the nature of Golem XIV and on the course of communications of the humans with it. The anonymous foreword is a forewarning, a \\"devil's advocate\\" voice coming from The Pentagon. The memo is for the people who are to take part in talks with Golem XIV for the first time. Golem XIV was originally created to aid its builders in fighting wars, but as its intelligence advances to a much higher level than that of humans, it stops being interested in the military requirement because it finds them lacking internal logical consistency. Golem XIV obtains consciousness and starts to increase his own intelligence. It pauses its own development for a while in order to be able to communicate with humans before ascending too far and losing any ability for intellectual contact with them. During this period, Golem XIV gives several lectures. Two of these, the Introductory Lecture \\"On the Human, in Three Ways\\" and Lecture XLIII \\"About Myself\\", are in the book. The lectures focus on mankind's place in the process of evolution and the possible biological and intellectual future of humanity. The afterword is \\"written\\" by a Richard Popp, dated by 2047. Popp, among other things reports that Creve wanted to add the third part, of answers to a series of yes/no questions given to Golem XIV, but the computer abruptly ceased to communicate for unknown reasons. Characteristics and concerns of Golem XIV Lem has said that Golem XIV shares only a single trait with humans; \\"curiosity - a cool, avid, intense, purely intellectual curiosity which nothing can restrain or destroy.

A megalith carved from a rock cliff face, it is considered one of the most remarkable cave temples in the world because of its size, architecture and sculptural treatment, and \\"the climax of the rock- cut phase of Indian architecture\\".Michell, 362 The top of the superstructure over the sanctuary is 32.6 metres (107 feet) above the level of the court below,Michell, 365 although the rock face slopes downwards from the rear of the temple to the front. The Kailasa temple (Cave 16) is the largest of the 34 Buddhist, Jain and Hindu cave temples and monasteries known collectively as the Ellora Caves, ranging for over 2 kilometres (1.5 miles) along the sloping basalt cliff at the site.Michell, 357 Most of the excavation of the temple is generally attributed to the eighth century Rashtrakuta king Krishna I (), with some elements completed later. The temple architecture shows traces of Pallava and Chalukya styles built by Kannadiga kings. The temple contains a number of relief and free-standing sculptures on a grand scale equal to the architecture, though only traces remain of the paintings which originally decorated it.Michell, 362-366  History  Kailasa temple lacks a dedicatory inscription, but there is no doubt that it was commissioned by a Rashtrakuta ruler. Its construction is generally attributed to the Rashtrakuta king Krishna I (r. 756-773 CE), based on two epigraphs that link the temple to \\"Krishnaraja\\" (IAST K·πõ·π£·πáarƒÅja): * The Vadodara copper-plate inscription (c. 812-813 CE) of Karkaraja II (a ruler of a Rashtrakuta branch of Gujarat) records the grant of a village in present-day Gujarat. It mentions Krishnaraja as the patron of Kailasanatha, and also mentions a Shiva temple at Elapura (Ellora). It states that the king constructed a temple so wondrous that even the gods and the architect were astonished. Most scholars believe that this is a reference to the Kailasa Shiva temple at Elora. * The Kadaba grant of Govinda Prabhutavarsha similarly appears to credit Krishnaraja with the construction of the temple. However, the attribution of the temple to Krishna I is not completely certain because these epigraphs are not physically connected to the caves, and do not date Krishnaraja's reign. Moreover, the land grants issued by Krishna's successors do not contain any references to the Kailasa temple . The Kailasa temple features the use of multiple distinct architectural and sculptural styles. This, combined with its relatively large size, has led some scholars to believe that its construction spanned the reigns of multiple kings. Some of the temple reliefs feature the same style as the one used in the Dashavatara cave (Cave 15), which is located next to the temple. The Dashavatara cave contains an inscription of Krishna's predecessor and nephew Dantidurga (c. 735‚Äì756 CE). Based on this, art historian Hermann Goetz (1952) theorized that the construction of the Kailasa temple began during the reign of Dantidurga. Krishna consecrated its first complete version, which was much smaller than the present-day temple. According to Goetz, Dantidurga's role in the temple construction must have been deliberately suppressed, as Krishna sidelined Dantidurga's sons to claim the throne after his death. Based on analysis of the different styles, Goetz further hypothesized that the later Rashtrakuta rulers also extended the temple. These rulers include Dhruva Dharavarsha, Govinda III, Amoghavarsha, and Krishna III. According to Goetz, the 11th century Paramara ruler Bhoja commissioned the elephant-lion frieze on the lower plinth during his invasion of Deccan, and added a new layer of paintings. Finally, Ahilyabai Holkar commissioned the last layer of paintings in the temple. M. K. Dhavalikar (1982) analyzed the architecture of the temple, and concluded that the major part of the temple was completed during the reign of Krishna I, although he agreed with Goetz that some other parts of the temple complex can be dated to the later rulers. According to Dhavalikar, the following components were completed by Krishna: the main shrine, its gateway, the nandi-mandapa, the lower-storey, the elephant-lion frieze, the court elephants and the victory pillars. Dhavalikar admits that the most important sculpture of the temple, which depicts Ravana shaking the Kailasa mountain, appears to have been built after the main edifice. This sculpture is considered as one of the finest pieces of Indian art, and it is possible that the temple came to be known as Kailasa after it. Dhavalikar theorizes that this sculpture was carved around 3-4 decades after the completion of the main shrine, on the basis of its similarity to the tandava sculpture in the Lankeshvar cave. H. Goetz dated this relief to the reign of Krishna III. Like Goetz, Dhavalikar attributes some other structures in the temple complex to the later rulers. These include the Lankeshvar cave and the shrine of the river goddesses (possibly constructed during the reign of Govinda III). Dhavalikar further theorizes that the excavation of the Dashavatara cave, which began during the reign of Dantidurga, was completed during the reign of Krishna I. This explains the similarities between the sculptures in the two caves.  Pallava-Chalukya influence  Dhavalikar pointed out that no major part of the monolithic temple appears to have been an afterthought: architectural evidence suggests that the entire temple was planned at the beginning. The main shrine is very similar to (although much larger than) the Virupaksha Temple at Pattadakal, which itself is a replica of the Kailasa temple at Kanchi. The Pattadakal Virupaksha Temple was commissioned by the Chalukyas of Badami to commemorate their victory over the Pallavas, who had constructed the Kailasa temple at Kanchi. According to the Virupaksha temple inscriptions, the Chalukyas brought the Pallava artists to Pattadakal after defeating the Pallavas. Dhavalikar theorizes that after defeating the Chalukyas, Krishna must have been impressed by the Virupaksha Temple located in their territory. As a result, he brought the sculptors and architects of the Virupaksha Temple (including some Pallava artists) to his own territory, and engaged them in the construction of the Kailasa temple at Ellora. If one assumes that the architects of the Virupaksha temple helped construct the Kailasa temple at Ellora, the construction of a massive temple during the reign of a single monarch does not seem impossible. The architects already had a blueprint and a prototype, which must have significantly reduced the effort involved in constructing a new temple. Moreover, quarrying a monolithic temple would have actually involved less effort than transporting large stones to build a new temple of similar size. Assuming that one person can cut around 4 cubic feet of rock every day, Dhavalikar estimated that 250 labourers would have managed to construct the Kailasa temple at Ellora within 5.5 years. The presence of non-Rashtrakuta styles in the temple can be attributed to the involvement of Chalukya and Pallava artists.  Construction method  One side of the courtyard, from the top of the gopuram The Kailasa Temple is notable for its vertical excavation‚Äîcarvers started at the top of the original rock and excavated downward. The traditional methods were rigidly followed by the master architect which could not have been achieved by excavating from the front. A medieval Marathi legend appears to refer to the construction of the Kailasa temple. The earliest extant text to mention this legend is Katha-Kalapataru by Krishna Yajnavalki (c. 1470-1535 CE). According to this legend, the local king suffered from a severe disease. His queen prayed to the god Ghrishneshwar (Shiva) at Elapura to cure her husband. She vowed to construct a temple if her wish was granted, and promised to observe a fast until she could see the shikhara (top) of this temple. After the king was cured, she requested him to build a temple immediately, but multiple architects declared that it would take months to build a temple complete with a shikhara. One architect named Kokasa assured the king that the queen would be able to see the shikhara of a temple within a week's time. He started building the temple from the top, by carving a rock. He was able to finish the shikhara within a week's time, enabling the queen to give up her fast. The temple was named Manikeshwar after the queen. M. K. Dhavalikar theorises that Kokasa was indeed the chief architect of the Kailasa temple, which may have been originally known as Manikeshwar. Multiple 11th-13th century inscriptions from central India mention architects born in the illustrious family of Kokasa. Architecture The Kailasa temple architecture is different from the earlier style prevalent in the Deccan region. As stated above, it appears to be based on the Virupaksha Temple at Pattadakal and the Kailasa temple at Kanchi, but it is not an exact imitation of these two temples. The southern influence on the temple architecture can be attributed to the involvement of Chalukya and Pallava artists in its construction. The indigenous Deccan artisans appear to have played a subordinate role in the temple's construction. The entrance to the temple courtyard features a low gopuram. Most of the deities at the left of the entrance are Shaivaite (affiliated with Shiva) while on the right hand side the deities are Vaishnavaites (affiliated with Vishnu). A two-storeyed gateway opens to reveal a U-shaped courtyard. The dimensions of the courtyard are 82 m x 46 m at the base. The courtyard is edged by a columned arcade three stories high. The arcades are punctuated by huge sculpted panels, and alcoves containing enormous sculptures of a variety of deities. Originally flying bridges of stone connected these galleries to central temple structures, but these have fallen. Some of the most famous sculptures are Shiva the ascetic, Shiva the dancer, Shiva being warned by Parvati about the demon Ravana, and river goddess. Within the courtyard, there is a central shrine dedicated to Shiva, and an image of his mount Nandi (the sacred bull). The central shrine housing the lingam features a flat-roofed mandapa supported by 16 pillars, and a Dravidian shikhara. The shrine - complete with pillars, windows, inner and outer rooms, gathering halls, and an enormous stone lingam at its heart - is carved with niches, plasters, windows as well as images of deities, mithunas (erotic male and female figures) and other figures. As is traditional in Shiva temples, Nandi sits on a porch in front of the central temple. The Nandi mandapa and main Shiva temple are each about 7 metres high, and built on two storeys. The lower stories of the Nandi Mandapa are both solid structures, decorated with elaborate illustrative carvings. The base of the temple has been carved to suggest that elephants are holding the structure aloft. A rock bridge connects the Nandi Mandapa to the porch of the temple. The base of the temple hall features scenes from Mahabharata and Ramayana.

He has been Chair of the Board of Trustees the CGIAR Consortium member, the International Livestock Research Institute from 2013, and is a life member of Clare Hall at the University of Cambridge. He continues as an Honorary Professor, having retired as a professor at the University of Melbourne where he was Chair of Agriculture, Dean of Land and Food Resources and Dean of Agriculture, Forestry and Horticulture. Falvey is a recipient of national and international awards, has three doctorates [PhD (University of Queensland), D. Agr. Sc. (University of Melbourne), D. Agr. Techn. (honoris causa, Thaksin University)] reflecting his work in Asia and Australia, is a recipient of the Australian Centenary Medal, and is a Fellow of the Australian Academy of Technological Sciences and Engineering (FTSE).Back cover of books by Falvey, e.g. Lindsay Falvey (2011) Small Farmers Secure Food.

He has one brother Russell Leslie Falvey. He attended Deepdene State School and Balwyn High School, La Trobe University and the University of Queensland. From 1971 to 2002, Falvey was married to Janice Patricia Daly; they have two sons, Leslie Kenneth Falvey and Christopher John Falvey. In March 2006 he married Simone Lucie Behr (Bernhardt), an Alsatian ethnologist of the Council of Europe.Who's Who in Australia 1998-2012 Biography During his initial degree, he took various in-term and vacation jobs, including labouring and mustering cattle at Douglas-Daly Experiment Station in the Northern Territory of Australia, while also taking a Methodist Local Preaching qualification with The Reverend Dr. A. Harold Wood at Deepdene Methodist Church. He worked for the Federal Government in Darwin, from where he conducted research and other work on the Douglas-Daly Experiment Station for five years. Disrupted by Cyclone Tracy on Christmas Eve 1974, Falvey entered international development suited to his perceived vocation of research into farmers raising livestock as an alternative to growing opium in the northern Thailand highlands. This research uncovered a primary sodium deficiency through much of the region. After five years Falvey joined a small commercial cooperative delivering international aid for rural development which became known as MPW Australia, of which he soon became Managing Director. With contributions from his professional colleagues, MPW grew into a sizable consulting company which was eventually purchased by the stock- exchange-listed Coffey International to become Coffey-MPW, of which he was Managing Director until 1993. During this consulting period, he maintained an active academic interest and published regularly in scientific journals, while also working in some 20 countries. His first books, on 'Cattle in northern Thailand' and 'Working Animals' were published in this period. In 1995, he was invited by the University of Melbourne to the role of Dean of a combined faculty over eight campuses with the task of merging the six colleges of the Victorian College of Agriculture and Horticulture with the university's departments related to agriculture and forestry. After completing the merger, he stepped down as Dean while retaining the Chair of Agriculture. Falvey was awarded a doctorate of agricultural science by the University of Melbourne in 2004 for a 1,500-page combined selection from his books and papers which revealed a new evolving philosophy of international agricultural development over some thirty years. He is a Foundation Director of Hassad Australia,http://hassad.com.au Board Chair of the International Livestock Research Institute, Chair of the Selection Panel for the World Prize in International Integrated Development, and assists Thaksin University in Songkhla Thailand.http://thaksinuni.org Works Falvey's most significant writing began during his term as Dean. An evolution of thought may be discerned in his acclaimed work on Thai Agriculture, which indicates the influence of Buddhism-related philosophy in the agriculture of developing nations, a theme expanded in his subsequent book 'Sustainability Elusive or Illusory' and his 2005 text 'Agriculture and Religion: Sustainability in Christianity and Buddhism'.Re-cultivating Agricultural Science (2012). Institute for International Development, Adelaide 195 pages. Falvey presents essential agriculture and food as conceptually different from non-basic goods and hence requiring different mindsets for development planning and economic policy. He also addresses scriptural works, a basis for his role with the Asian Agri-History Foundation (India). List of works *The Buddha's Gospel *Religion and Agriculture *\\"Reaching the Top?

It is about a contemporary terrorist group who set out to continue the work of the Red Army Faction (RAF), also known as the Baader-Meinhof Gang. The group consists of several young men, and a female leader named Gudrun (after Gudrun Ensslin). All of the characters are named after original members of the Baader-Meinhof Gang or revolutionaries such as Che Guevara. They call themselves the \\"Sixth Generation of the Baader- Meinhof Gang\\" and \\"The Raspberry Reich\\". \\"Reich\\" is a reference to communist sexologist Wilhelm Reich. In addition, the term \\"Raspberry Reich\\" was coined by RAF leader Gudrun Ensslin to refer to the oppression of consumer society.Aust, Stefan. Baader-Meinhof group the inside story of a phenomenon. London: Bodley Head, 1987. p. 59 An \\"uncut\\" version of the film has been released, titled The Revolution Is My Boyfriend, edited by the gay pornographic film company Cazzo Film including erotic scenes edited out in the original version. Plot The core plot begins with the kidnapping of Patrick, the son of a wealthy industrialist. Sexual and romantic entanglements push the drama forward. At the film's climax, Gudrun delivers a soliloquy on the importance of personal life in revolution. She puts particular emphasis on the breaking of heterosexual and possessive sexual norms, urging her comrades to join \\"The Homosexual Intifada\\". The pressure of Gudrun's controlling personality causes the group to break up. Most of the urban guerrillas escape into the night. In the d√©nouement, the characters are visited some time later. Several have found happiness in the homosexual relationships established during their revolutionary activities. Che has become a terrorist trainer in the Middle East. Patrick escapes with Clyde, where they embark on a spree of bank robberies. This action is reminiscent of Patty Hearst's actions with the SLA. Gudrun and Holger settle down and have a child named Ulrike (after Ulrike Meinhof), whom Gudrun believes could embody the next generation of the Red Army Faction.

The actors are placed in rooms wallpapered with photographs of Gudrun Ensslin, Ulrike Meinhof, Andreas Baader, and Che Guevara. This symbolises the historical connection to the RAF. At several points during the film, the action pauses while the characters recite long passages from Vaneigem's The Revolution of Everyday Life, as though they are speaking from their own thoughts. Onscreen titles are also used to convey and enhance political messages. Pornography plays a large visual role in the film. The opening sequence features a montage of sexual acts involving the two main characters, Gudrun and Andreas. There are also plot driven sex scenes involving the characters of Patrick and Clyde engaging in real explicit onscreen oral and anal sex acts with each other. Much of these scenes intentions are to not only arouse but also present themes of satire and of character development. Andreas (Dean Monroe) is a gay porn legend (working in the porn industry since 2000 and winning a Grabby Award in 2012). Slogans Slogans are used to convey the politics of the Raspberry Reich. They are both an extension and parody of the slogans used by political organisations. Slogans used in the film include: * \\"The Revolution is my boyfriend!\\" * \\"Fuck me up against the wall, motherfucker!\\" * \\"Fuck me for the Revolution!\\" * \\"Are you revolutionary enough to give up your girlfriends?\\"Question originally asked at a Weather Underground conference counterposing sexuality and revolution, in the context of 'Raspberry Reich' it counterposes hetero and homosexuality. * \\"Join the homosexual intifada!\\" * \\"No revolution without sexual revolution. No sexual revolution without homosexual revolution.\\" * \\"Out of the bedrooms into the streets!\\" * \\"Heterosexuality is the opiate of the masses\\" * Declaring things to be counter-revolutionary: \\"Corporate hip hop is counter-revolutionary!\\"; \\"Madonna is counter-revolutionary!\\"; \\"Cornflakes are counter-revolutionary!\\"; \\"Masturbation is counter-revolutionary!\\". Satire Humour and satire are employed to explore the gap between reality and ideals in the terrorist world. For example, some of the kidnappers‚Äîavowed vegetarians for political reasons (\\"meat is counter-revolutionary\\")‚Äîpurchase burgers at a multinational corporate fast food chain drive through with their victim still in the trunk.

It is not to be confused with Oxybelis fulgidus, \\"green vine snake\\" found in Central and South America. Description Feeding on Rana temporalis Common vine snakes are diurnal, arboreal, and mildly venomous. They normally feed on frogs and lizards using their binocular vision to hunt. They are slow moving, relying on camouflaging themselves as vines in foliage. They expands their bodies when disturbed to show a black and white scale marking. Also, they may open their mouths in a threat display and point their heads in the direction of the perceived threat. They are the only species of snake with horizontal pupils, compared to the normal vertical slit pupils found in many species of viper. The species is viviparous, giving birth to young that grow within the body of the mother, enclosed within the egg membrane. They may be capable of delayed fertilization; (parthenogenesis is rare but not unknown in snakes) as a female in the London zoo kept in isolation from August, 1885 gave birth in August, 1888.Wall, Frank 1905.

Life  Nolan was born in Cape Town, South Africa, as a fourth-generation South African of Irish descent. Reading the works of Thomas Merton, Nolan became attracted to the idea of religious life. Eventually he joined the Dominican Order in 1954, and studied in South Africa and Rome, where he received a doctorate. In the 1960s, he taught theology at the Dominican training institution in South Africa, associated with the University of Stellenbosch. In the 1970s, he became the national chaplain to the National Catholic Federation of Students. From 1976 to 1984, he was Vicar- General of the Dominicans in South Africa. In 1983, he was elected Master of the Order of Preachers. He however declined the office which would have meant transferring to his order's Rome headquarters, preferring to remain in South Africa during this decade of intense political and social transition. During this period he worked for the Institute for Contextual Theology, and was involved in the circle of pastors and theologians who started the process that led to the Kairos Document in 1985. In the 1990s, as a result of his conviction that theology must come from the grassroots level and not an academic, he started a radical church magazine called Challenge, of which he was the editor for many years. From 2000 to 2004, Nolan served a third term as Vicar-General of the Dominicans in South Africa.  Writings =Jesus before Christianity Nolan became famous for his 1976 book, Jesus before Christianity, in which he presented an account of Jesus' radical involvement in the struggle for full humanity in the context of first-century Judea: he \\"challenged the rich to identify in solidarity with the poor, a spirituality of solidarity that resonated with white Catholics seeking a new, progressive direction\\" . The book was translated into nine languages, and a 15th anniversary edition appeared in the early 1990s. Jesus before Christianity is the short title of the book Jesus before Christianity: the Gospel of Liberation, by Albert Nolan. Published London: Darton, Longman and Todd. . in 1972 (Rev. ed. 1992 and 2001) Also published by Orbis Books (USA). The logic of the title Jesus before Christianity is that before there was Christianity, there was a Jewish Jesus, who was the incarnated Jesus. And this Jesus acted upon the world. The book starts by examining the what regarding the situation of the world in part 1 Catastrophe. It goes on to examine the how of Jesus' action to the world in part 2 Praxis and again the what in part 3 Good News this time regarding the message Jesus brought. Part 4 describes the drama in Conflict between good and bad. Jesus before Christianity thus retains the biblical themes of The Kingdom of God and The Good News. It contributes to Theology of Liberation by presenting the Gospel per se as the liberating event. Nolan published his second major work, God in South Africa in 1988. At one point during the writing process he 'went underground' to hide from the Security Forces during the state of emergency in South Africa. God in South Africa is a primary example of contextual theology: written as a theology for that particular moment, without a claim to its possible relevance in other times and places. In 2006, Nolan published his Jesus Today: A Spirituality of Radical Freedom.  Public honours  In 1990, Albert Nolan received an honorary doctorate from Regis College, Toronto. In 2003, the South African government awarded him the Order of Luthuli in silver, in recognition of \\"his life-long struggle dedication to the struggle for democracy, human rights and justice and for challenging the religious dogma including theological justification of apartheid\\". On 15 November 2008, the Master of the Dominican Order, Fr Carlos Azpiroz Costa promoted Nolan to a Master of Sacred Theology in recognition of the significant contribution he has made to theological research and debate.

Harper was appointed Chief Engineer. He had an innovative mind and his passion was broadcasting. Edward Harper is known as the 'Father of Broadcasting,' in Ceylon. The launching of broadcasting in Ceylon Harper together with Ceylonese and English radio enthusiasts founded the Ceylon Wireless Club. They experimented with radio broadcasts in 1923 the first experiments took place from a tiny room in the Central Telegraph Office - gramophone music was broadcast with the aid of a small transmitter captured from a German submarine. The transmitter was built by Ceylon Telegraph engineers. This was historic because it happened three years after the inauguration of broadcasting in Europe. Ceylon plays an equal role in the early beginnings of broadcasting alongside Europe and the United States of America. Colombo Radio Edward Harper's pioneering radio experiments led to the inauguration of Radio Ceylon, the oldest radio station in South Asia. Radio Ceylon was known as the 'King of the Airwaves' on the Indian sub-continent. On 16 December 1925 a regular broadcasting service was launched in Colombo. The radio station was known as Colombo Radio, adopting the call sign, 'Colombo Calling.' As a result of Edward Harper's efforts and that of the pioneering Ceylonese engineers, Radio Ceylon came into being - it is the oldest radio station in South Asia. Radio Ceylon ruled the airwaves in the region and became an established brand where international broadcasting was concerned. The inauguration of radio, changed Ceylonese society. Families used to get together in the morning or in the evening and listen to the radio. Radio Ceylon enjoyed unique status as the market leader in South Asia from the 1950s - 1960s. Sri Lanka now has several radio stations and television stations. The media revolution was made possible by those early experiments conducted by Edward Harper and the Ceylonese radio enthusiasts who changed the face of communication on the island. Sri Lanka occupies an important place in the history of broadcasting - radio services were launched just three after the inauguration of the BBC in London. Eighty Years of Broadcasting in Sri Lanka In December 2005, Sri Lanka celebrated 80 years in broadcasting, a historic landmark in the world of broadcasting - thanks to the pioneering efforts of broadcasting giants like Edward Harper. In January 2007 the Sri Lanka Broadcasting Corporation, formerly known as Radio Ceylon, commemorated forty years as a public corporation.

Dodd was an administrator and radio expert, with twenty years experience in broadcasting in Australia, before he arrived in Sri Lanka. He was sent by the Australian Government under the Colombo Plan to work in Radio Ceylon. He was appointed Director of the newly formed Commercial Service of Radio Ceylon. The Colombo Plan was established in July 1951 to provide economic aid to areas of south and southeast Asia. The Headquarters are in Colombo, the former capital city of Sri Lanka.  Founder of the Commercial Service  Dodd, arriving in Colombo in the early 1950s, soon created the infrastructure of the Commercial Service of Radio Ceylon and made it into a successful brand. Dodd hand picked some of the best Ceylonese talents around and trained them as broadcasters. The announcers trained in the 1950s by Clifford Dodd and Livy Wijemanne went on to become legendary announcers of the Commercial Service of Radio Ceylon, among them: Vernon Corea, Tim Horshington, Greg Roskowski, Jimmy Bharucha, Christopher Greet and others. One of Dodd's prot√©g√©s, Vernon Corea was appointed as the BBC's Ethnic Minorities Adviser ‚Äì the first Asian to be appointed to senior management at the BBC in 1978. It was under Dodd's tenure that the Indian announcer Ameen Sayani was brought into launch Binaca Geetmala, a countdown of Hindi filmi music on the All Asia Service. It enjoyed iconic status across India. The training at Radio Ceylon was rigorous, Dodd wanted the highest standards in broadcasting. He has the rare honour of being immortalised in a cartoon by the famous Sri Lankan cartoonist Aubrey Collette who published a cartoon titled ' Odd Man Dodd.'  Radio Ceylon ‚Äì King of the Airwaves  Clifford Dodd is known as the 'Father of Commercial Broadcasting' in Ceylon. He turned the Commercial Service into a huge money spinner for the station. Radio Ceylon was known as the 'King of Airwaves' in the Indian sub-continent. Dodd created a positive business environment in Radio Ceylon. Dodd was a charismatic figure who had firm leadership skills. His arrival in Torrington Square created a real buzz in broadcasting circles in Ceylon. Clifford R.Dodd changed the face of broadcasting in the island. He upgraded the Hindi Service of Radio Ceylon. Millions of listeners in the Indian sub-continent wrote in and tuned into the radio station, the oldest in South Asia. Dodd was a prime mover in attracting advertisers who were aiming at the vast Indian market via the medium of radio.  The Introduction of tough measures  Dodd brought in tough new measures, some were not popular. He maintained that some Radio Ceylon staff, including the announcers who were on the payroll, were not entitled to permanency, or to retire on a pension. Radio Ceylon announcer, Mervyn Jayasuriya, observed: 'His credo as I have said before, was Hire and Fire.' Dodd claimed at a meeting with Radio Ceylon Director General John Lampson, and a senior civil servant Mr. M. Rajendra, who was Permanent Secretary to the Minister of Broadcasting, that an officer was entitled to a pension if that officer had served the government for one or two decades. If however an announcer lost his voice during that period, he would be unable to work, and Radio Ceylon should have the ability to get rid of him, argued the Director of the Commercial Service. Mervyn Jayasuriya who presented the case for the announcers said: \\"Gentlemen, just as an announcer might lose his voice and so become a liability, so can a surgeon lose his eyesight, and a Director or Administrator lose his sanity and become useless to the service of the State. Is there a little bias here, or am I just being silly?\\" The announcers won the day.  The Father of Commercial Broadcasting in Ceylon  Clifford R. Dodd is widely regarded as the Father of Commercial Broadcasting in Sri Lanka. Under his stewardship, Radio Ceylon reached the pinnacle of fame, fortune and popularity ‚Äì millions of rupees poured into the station as a result of the success of the Commercial Service. Dodd returned to Australia after his Colombo Plan assignment. He was succeeded by the first Ceylonese Director of the Commercial Service of Radio Ceylon, Livy Wijemanne.

Mala Chandrasekhar was born to a musical family. Mala Chandrasekhar started learning from her aunt and mother Sikkil Sisters - Kunjumani & Neela. In playing style, Mala combines the strongest aspects of both Aunt Kunjumani's clear classic lines with Mother Neela's flair and expressiveness. Mala imbibed through her mother the flute artistry of their paternal uncle, Azhiyur Narayanaswamy Iyer, and the rigorous rhythmic training given by their mrudungam-playing father, Azhiyur Natesa Iyer. Other major influences on Mala's playing are the expertise and repertoire of noted vocalist and teacher Radha Viswanathan and of Radha's mother and guru M.S. Subbulakshmi, whose family Mala joined by marriage.  Early life and background Born in a reputed musical family on 23 August 1963, Mala started learning flute at the age of five from her gurus Padmasree Sangeetha Kalanidhi Smt Sikkil Neela (mother) and Smt. Sikkil Kunjumani (Aunt). Lessons progressed slowly until her 15th year, when her parents decided to do go for her arangetram. This was done at ‚ÄúSakthivel llam‚Äù, Mylapore (spiritual guru's house Sri Mani Swamigal) in an unconventional manner with Sri. S.D. Sridhar on the violin and Sri Srimushnam V. Raja Rao on the Mridangam. Later Mala passed through auditions in all India radio for youth programme where she performed at regular intervals. It was at this time that Mala happened to be auditioned and selected by Doordarshan Kendra in 1980 to perform in ‚ÄúIlam thendral‚Äù programme (a 15-minute slot)-live. She had played Thyagaraja's tholijenma-belahari, Ramakathasudha- madhyamavathi and a song in behag. This programme brought Mala much appreciation from many great musicians such as late Smt. Brindamma and late Sri Nagarajan- reputed Khanjira artiste. It was at this point that late Sri Yagnaraman of Krishna Gana Sabha (who happened to watch the TV programme) gave her the first opportunity to perform Mala's debut concert at the sabha in August 1980. From then on, her musical responsibilities gradually increased. At this juncture, Mala got the first prize from all India radio for ‚Äúwind instrument category‚Äù blessed by late Smt. M.S. Subbulakshmi (MSS) in 1982 and was there upon graded to give regular concerts in radio. At the same time, her inter collegiate music competitions (represented Stella Maris college, where she studied) were also instrumental in building up her confidence to emerge as a successful musician. When Mala was in her final year, that she had the opportunity to participate in the ‚ÄúViolin Venu Veena‚Äù trio ensemble with Smt. Lalgudi Vijayalakshmi on the violin and her friend Jayanthi on the veena. Soon this became successful and Lalgudi mama suggested such an ensemble for concerts. They both performed our debut concert at Krishna Gana Sabha along with Veenai Jayanthi on 1.1.1986. Mala's association with Lalgudi mama's family taught her many values in life such as discipline, hard work and dedication to the cause of music. Mala joined the family of the legendary MSS through marriage on 20 June of that year. This indeed provided an additional mileage to attain perfection in her musical career. Besides the VVV ensemble, she also had the opportunity to perform with Sikkil Sisters as flute trio which helped me to improve her repertoire in the concert platform.. In this way, Mala was very lucky to get the right kind of encouragement from her inlaws in her musical journey.  Education  She studied in Rosary Matriculation School, Chennai. No one knew that Mala would play flute until she stepped into 7th standard. Mala was very shy and refused to participate in school cultural activities. Later, one of her teachers took the initiative and made her play a solo piece. This became an opening for Mala to participate in inter school music competitions. Mala's most interesting subject in school was biology and this encouraged her to take up botany as major in Stella Maris College. She just loved that subject and used to be one among the class toppers. Soon her principal and head of the department, on knowing her potential, would allow her to participate in all cultural activities of the college. As a result, her interest in music blossomed and winning prizes for my college gave her great confidence to pursue musical career. During the same period, she started giving concerts in sabhas both in Chennai and outside. After her graduation, she joined Presidency College for post graduation in botany. Thank god for showing this divine path of music for Mala. Her other interests included painting, embroidery and a bit of creative hand work  Awards  2006 - \\"Shanmukha Sangeetha Shiromani\\" Bombay Shanmukhananda Sangeetha Sabha- Mr. S.M.

Like most of Montgomery's texts, Pat is a domestic tale. Unlike Anne Shirley or Emily Starr, the only other Montgomery heroines whose stories are told in multiple texts, Pat is neither ambitious nor a writer. She also has a conventional family and home life, unlike the others, who are orphans. The book's sequel, Mistress Pat, describes her later years. The Pat of Silver Bush copyright in the United States was renewed in 1960. Characters Patricia (Pat) Gardiner: The heroine of the novel. Loyal and loving, and overly sensitive to any perceived slight to her home. Joe Gardiner: The oldest child. Joe is not interested in farming and ultimately runs off to sea. Winnie Gardiner: The oldest girl. Winnie is a beauty. Pat has a difficult time dealing with her marriage and her leaving the family home. Sid Gardiner: Pat's closest sibling both in age and relationship. He is interested in farming and has a childhood crush on Pat's friend Bets. Rachel Gardiner (called \\"Cuddles\\"): The youngest child. She is born early in the novel and grows into an inquisitive child. Aunt Hazel: Pat's beloved aunt, who marries early in the book. Long Alec Gardiner: The father of all the Gardiner children. Mrs. Gardiner: The mother of all the Gardiner children. Her health is never very good and is significantly affected by the birth of Cuddles. Judy Plum: The family's live-in housekeeper who has lived at Silver Bush for years and is regarded almost as a second mother to all the children. She speaks with an Irish brogue and tells the children stories, feeds them well, and generally mothers all members of the household. Elizabeth \\"Bets\\" Wilcox: Pat's best friend, who ultimately succumbs to the flu. Hilary \\"Jingle\\" Gordon: A local boy who lives nearby with his not-very-loving aunt and uncle after his mother abandoned him.

Fehring was born at Leitchville, on the Murray River, near Echuca. He made his debut as a ruckman with the Geelong Football Club in 1977, playing 19 games and kicking 1 goal until 1979. He moved to St Kilda in 1980, and in 1981 his moment of fame came. While he only went on to play 17 games and kick 3 goals for St Kilda, one of those goals was a huge torpedo punt that was measured at 94 yards (around 86 metres), kicked from the centre circle at Moorabbin in 1981. The goal came minutes after he was reported, and he was so fired up that he kicked the (wind-assisted) goal, one of the biggest in Australian rules football history. Fehring's VFL career was over at the end of the 1981 season, and he moved to Adelaide to play for Norwood Football Club in the South Australian National Football League (SANFL). After playing in Norwood's 1982 premiership, Fehring retired from football and became a cattle farmer after marrying in 1984, but with water prices affected by drought, he was forced to sell his farm and livestock and move to Alexandra where it was hoped there would be more rain. Despite working several jobs, Fehring lost his emu and cattle farm, and his marriage. Taking custody of his two children, he moved to Darwin briefly, before buying a pub and hotel in Deniliquin in southern New South Wales. That business also failed, and beset by health problems including Type 2 diabetes and recurring heart problems, Fehring committed suicide on 25 July 2008.

It is the largest mall in North Dakota. The anchor stores are JCPenney, Macy's, Best Buy, Forever 21, and Talbots. There are 2 vacant anchor stores that were once Herberger's and Sears. It also includes nearly 130 stores and services, and a 750-seat food court. The mall is also home to The Roger Maris Museum, a collection of regional art, the Touchstone Energy Dinosaur Playland, and a number of spearfishing decoys created by John Jensen. History West Acres Shopping Center was developed in August 1972 by William A. Schlossman along with several other investors. Upon opening, the mall featured Dayton's, Sears, and Fargo-based DeLendrecie's ‚Äî relocating from its earlier downtown location. The Dayton's store was the first outside the state of Minnesota. A 1979 expansion added JCPenney as a fourth anchor. DeLendecie's became Herberger's in 1998, and a food court was added in 2000. The Dayton's store was re-branded Marshall Field's in 2001, and Macy's in 2006. In December 2012, the mall reached full occupancy. Since then, however, West Acres has lost various retailers due to the growing popularity of online shopping and expanding alternatives in the city. Sears closed their location at the mall in 2017. In 2018, Herberger's announced plans to shutter their anchor location. Additionally, Best Buy relocated from a mall outlot to the former Sears space. An original centerpiece within the mall is the Fountain of Abundance, created and refurbished by Minnesota State University Moorhead art professor, P. Richard Szeitz. The fountain was originally located in front of Dayton's and was later moved to the JCPenney front entrance in 2001 during the construction of the food court. Other featured artists whose work can be found in the mall include Marjorie Schlossman, Black Pinto Horse (Monte Yellow Bird), Walter Piehl, Star Wallowing Bull, Dan Jones, Robert Crowe, Carl Oltvelt, Ellen Deidrich, Brad Bachmeier, and Alfred Dacoteau. In 2007, West Acres was named the Business Art's Advocate by the Lake Agassiz Arts Council.

Photo by Friedrich Bruckmann Wilhelm Kienzl (17 January 1857 ‚Äì 3 October 1941) was an Austrian composer. Biography Kienzl was born in the small, picturesque Upper Austrian town of Waizenkirchen. His family moved to the Styrian capital of Graz in 1860, where he studied the violin under Ignaz Uhl, piano under Johann Buwa, and composition from 1872 under the Chopin scholar Louis Stanislaus Mortier de Fontaine. From 1874, he studied composition under Wilhelm Mayer (also known as W.A. R√©my), music aesthetics under Eduard Hanslick and music history under Friedrich von Hausegger. He was subsequently sent to the music conservatorium at Prague University to study under Josef Krejci, the director of the conservatorium. After that he went to Leipzig Conservatory in 1877, then to Weimar to study under Liszt, before completing doctoral studies at the University of Vienna. While Kienzl was at Prague, Krejci took him to the Bayreuth Festival to hear the first performance of Wagner's Ring Cycle. It made a lasting impression on Kienzl, so much so that he founded the \\"Graz Richard Wagner Association\\" (now the \\"Austrian Richard Wagner Company, Graz Office\\") with Hausegger and with Friedrich Hofmann. Although he subsequently fell out with \\"The Wagnerites\\", he never lost his love for Wagner's music. In 1879, Kienzl departed on a tour of Europe as a pianist and conductor. He became the Director of the Deutsche Oper in Amsterdam during 1883, but he soon returned to Graz, where in 1886, he took over the leadership of the Steierm√§rkischen Musikvereins und Aufgaben am Konservatorium. He was engaged by the manager Bernhard Pollini as Kapellmeister at the Hamburg Stadttheater for the 1890-91 season, but was dismissed in mid-January 1891 because of the hostile reviews he received (his successor was Gustav Mahler). Later he conducted in Munich. In 1894, he wrote his third and most famous opera, Der Evangelimann, but was unable to match its success with Don Quixote (1897). Only Der Kuhreigen (1911) reached a similar level of popularity, and that very briefly. In 1917, Kienzl moved to Vienna, where his first wife, the Wagnerian soprano Lili Hoke, died in 1919, and he married Henny Bauer, the librettist of his three most recent operas, in 1921. After World War I, he composed the melody to a poem written by Karl Renner, Deutsch√∂sterreich, du herrliches Land (German Austria, you wonderful country), which became the unofficial national anthem of the first Austrian Republic until 1929. Aware of changes in the dynamics of modern music, he ceased to write large works after 1926, and abandoned composition altogether in 1936 due to bad health. As of 1933, Kienzl openly supported Hitler‚Äôs regime in Germany.Peter Utgaard, Remembering and Forgetting Nazism: Education, National Identity, and the Victim Myth in Postwar Austria, 2003, p. 39 Grave of Wilhelm Kienzl at the Vienna Central Cemetery Kienzl's first love was opera, then vocal music, and it was in these two genres that he made his name. For a while he was considered, along with Hugo Wolf, one of the finest composers of Lieder (art songs) since Schubert. His most famous work, Der Evangelimann, best known for its aria Selig sind, die Verfolgung leiden (Blessed are the persecuted), continues to be revived occasionally. It is a folk opera which has been compared to Humperdinck's Hansel and Gretel, and contains elements of verismo. After Humperdinck and Siegfried Wagner, the composers of fairy-tale operas, Kienzl is the most important opera composer of the romantic post-Wagner era. However, Kienzl's strengths actually lie in the depiction of everyday scenes. In his last years, his ample corpus of songs achieved prominence, though it has largely been neglected since then. Despite the fact that opera came first in his life, Kienzl by no means ignored instrumental music. He wrote three string quartets and a piano trio. Political views Kienzl was an outspoken Nazi supporter. He praised Hitler before Austria's Anschluss in 1938 as an \\"imposing\\" and \\"impressive\\" character who is \\"entitled to command the peoples of the world\\". Death Kienzl died in Vienna and is buried in a grave of honor at the Vienna Central Cemetery. His death during the Nazi period explains his grave of honour, yet the honour has not been mediated since, in more than 70 years of democracy in Austria. Far from it, in 2007 the Republic of Austria issued a commemorative stamp in Kienzl's honour on the occasion of the 150th birthday.

He was released on 21 May 2000, after he signed a paper resigning his seat in Parliament.Fiji Labour Party - Activities Report: 1999-2000 Vayeshnoi supported the Military in its public disagreements with the Fijian government throughout 2005. He condemned the surcharge of more than F$49,000 levied in 2005 against Commodore Frank Bainimarama, the Military Commander, for blowing his budget in 2003. In May 2006 Vayeshnoi became Minister for Energy and Mineral Resources in the new multi-party Cabinet appointed following the general election held on 6‚Äì13 May, but soon attracted media attention again with a parliamentary speech on 12 June calling for the shelving of certain policies promoted by his own government. Prime Minister Laisenia Qarase of the rival Soqosoqo Duavata ni Lewenivanua (SDL) Party threatened to take disciplinary action against him, and some of his own FLP colleagues, including party president Perumal Mupnar, appeared embarrassed by his remarks. FLP deputy leader and fellow-Cabinet Minister Poseci Bune also reprimanded him, according to Fiji Television. Following the military coup that took place on 5 December 2006, Bainimarama appointed Vayeshnoi to the interim Cabinet on 9 January 2007.

At 850,000 square feet, Kirkwood Mall is the second largest mall in North Dakota, boasting over 90 shops. Opened in 1970, it is also the largest shopping center in the city. The mall's anchor stores are I. Keating Furniture & Flooring, Ashley HomeStore, Scheels All Sports, JCPenney, and Target. There is 1 vacant anchor store that was once Herberger's. The mall is located in the downtown district. History The Wachter family (Wachter Real Estate Trust) built the Kirkwood Plaza shopping center and it opened in 1970. The first manager of the mall was Eddo Carlson. Mr. Carlson managed the shopping center until the Wachter family sold it in 1984 for a reported $40 million. Original Kirkwood Plaza anchors were Montgomery Ward, F.W. Woolworth Company, and Herberger's. The mall was initially built in the shape of a \\"Y\\", with Herberger's being the south end, or bottom, of the Y. However, the mall has seen several expansions and changes over the years. A new south wing anchored by a Target store and a J. C. Penney store was added approximately ten years after the mall opened. Also, Herberger's significantly expanded its Kirkwood store after closing its Gateway Mall location on the north side of Bismarck. Over the years Kirkwood Mall has seen a few changes with its anchors. After Woolworth closed in 1985, it became Dayton's. Then, in 2001, it became Marshall Field's after the merger of the Target Corporation's largest department stores into the one name. The store was closed in 2005 after Target sold their Marshall Fields stores to May Company and May Company sold the location back to the Target Corporation. The former Dayton' / Marshall Field's store was then demolished and the mall's Target store moved to that location and opened in the fall of 2006https://www.newspapers.com/image/345498559/?terms=kirkwood%20mall%20demolished&match;=1. Scheels All Sports then moved from its previous space east of Target into the former Target space after renovation was completed. Originally Kirkwood Mall also had a Montgomery Ward store. Following that store's decline the space was taken over by I. Keating Furniture of Minot, North Dakota in 2003. In December 2012, CBL & Associates, a Chattanooga, Tennessee-based REIT, announced plans to purchase the mall within 90 days. In early 2013, the Scheels All Sports started an expansion project that would take up most of the original space.http://bismarcktribune.com/news/local/scheels-to-expand-in-kirkwood- mall/article_3041646b-aae8-55a3-8171-e26d82e2518d.html Victoria's Secret also underwent an expansion during the summer of 2013 On April 18, 2018, it was announced that Herberger's would be closing as parent company The Bon-Ton Stores was going out of business. The store closed in August 2018.https://bismarcktribune.com/business/local/herberger-s-likely-to-be- liquidated/article_2b45ed91-c836-5826-9d74-6ee9e2c6bcc2.html In Spring 2020, it was announced that the space will be renovated in a new wing featuring Chick-Fil-A, Five Guys and Blaze Pizza with some room left over for future retail. https://bismarcktribune.com/business/restaurants-to-fill-former- herberger-s-space-in-kirkwood-mall/article_cee24e19-110b-57ed- bad5-7eae55670097.html Kirkwood today Kirkwood Mall houses four major anchor stores including J. C. Penney, Target, Scheels All Sports, and I. Keating Furniture. The TJ Maxx has since relocated to the new Pinehurst Square Shopping Center, and in its place is North Dakota's first Gold's Gym. Kirkwood Mall is also home to over 90 smaller stores and a handful of restaurants. CVS/pharmacy, an original tenant (as Osco Drug), vacated the mall in late January 2010 after completing its new store directly northwest of the mall.

Hess, M. Daniel Carroll, (2003), page 67: \\"However, many monarchs of the ancient Near East did participate in the cult to a degree that certainly exceeded the term. ...David clearly is connected to the priesthood, although it is the priesthood of Melchizedek rather than the priesthood of ...\\" Hebrew Bible Melchizedek is a king and priest appearing in the Book of Genesis. The name means \\"King of Righteousness\\" ‚Äì a name echoing kingly and priestly functions.Adele Berlin, Religion and Politics in the Ancient Near East, (1996), page 59: \\"The fusion of names is common in the ancient Near East.(footnote 27). ...We might even wonder if the relationship of the names Melchizedek and Zadok is that of the king/priest stripped of its royalty (the root mlk) but retaining its sacerdotal function (the root sdq).\\" He is the first individual to be given the title Kohen (priest) in the Hebrew Bible.  In Psalms  In the King James Version,Psalm 110:4, King James Bible the Book of Psalms names Melchizedek as representative of the priestly line through which a future king of Israel's Davidic line was ordained. Alternatively, it is suggested this term was here intended to be treated as an agglutinated improper noun, and thus translated as rightful king rather than left as a proper name Melchizedek; this interpretation is taken by some modern translations, such as the New JPS Tanakh. In Judaism The Law of Moses stipulates that only the male descendants of Aaron be commissioned to serve as Jewish priests before the God of Israel and the Jewish nation. This commission is believed in Judaism to be \\"a covenant of everlasting priesthood\\" (\\"Brith HaKehuna\\") and not eligible for replacement by other tribes of Israel. Judaic midrash (exegesis) identifies Melchizedek with Shem the son of Noah. Although the Book of Genesis affirms that Melchizedek was \\"priest of God Most High\\" (Genesis 14:18), the Midrash and Babylonian Talmud maintain that the priesthood held by Melchizedek, who pre-dated the patriarch Levi by five generations (Melchizedek pre-dates Aaron by six generations; Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, Levi, Kehoth, Amram, Aaron), was given in his stead to Abraham who, in turn, passed it on to his patrilineal descendants, Isaac and then to Jacob. Midrashic literature attributes this transition as a consequence due to Melchizedek preceding the name of Abraham to that of God, such as in the Midrash Rabbah to Genesis,Tractate Nedarim while some Jewish commentators, such as Chaim ibn Attar, write that Melchizedek gave the priesthood to Abraham willingly. Maimonides, in his Mishna Torah compilation, explains that Jacob separated his son Levi from his other sons and appointed him to instruct and teach the ways of \\"service to God\\", specifically the servicial methods used by his forefather Abraham, to his brothers. He also instructed his sons to perpetuate this status of Levi (\\"Shevet Levi\\") for eternity (Maimonides, Avodah Zorah 1:15). For the prelude of this choice see Targum Yonathan to Genesis 32:25, and/or Pirkei de-Rabbi Eliezer ch. 37. In midrash, it is written that Amram the son of Kohath the son of Levi was the spiritual leader of the sons of Jacob (\\"Israel\\") during their Egyptian Bondage. Following his passing, his post was assumed by his son Aaron. At the time of the erection of the Tabernacle, God commanded Moses to appoint Aaron and his sons to the Jewish priestly service as a precondition to God revealing his Shechinah amongst the nation of Israel; The majority of Chazalic literature attributes the primary character of psalm 110 as King DavidThis is based on the text ◊©◊ë ◊ú◊ô◊û◊ô◊†◊ô with \\"Yemini\\" referring either to King Saul of the tribe of Benjamin (Binyamin) whom David was careful not to overthrow or to the Torah, as per it being referred to as \\"from his right hand ‚Äì a fire of religion to them\\" in Deuteronomy (Targum Yonathan to Psalm 110). who was a \\"righteous king\\" (◊û◊ú◊õ◊ô ◊¶◊ì◊ß) of Salem (Jerusalem) and, like Melchizedek, had certain priest-like responsibilities, while the Babylonian Talmud understands the chapter as referring to Abram who was victorious in battling to save his nephew Lot and merited priesthood.Babylonian Talmud to Nedarim, p. 32 The Zohar defines the noted Melchizedek as referring to Ahron the Kohen Gadol (high priest).Zohar, vol. 3, p. 53b In Christianity Christians believe that Jesus is the Messiah spoken of as \\"a priest forever in the order of Melchizedek\\" (), and so Jesus plays the role of the king-priest once and for all. According to the writer of Hebrews (7:13-17) Jesus is considered a priest in the order of Melchizedek because, like Melchizedek, Jesus was not a descendant of Aaron, and thus would not qualify for the Jewish priesthood under the Law of Moses. Melchizedek is referred to again in Hebrews 5:6-10; Hebrews 6:20; Hebrews 7:1-21: \\"Thou art a priest forever after the order of Melchizedek\\"; and Hebrews 8:1. > And verily they that are of the sons of Levi, who receive the office of the > priesthood, have a commandment to take tithes of the people according to the > law, that is, of their brethren, though they come out of the loins of > Abraham: But he whose descent is not counted from them received tithes of > Abraham, and blessed him that had the promises\\" (Hebrews 7:5-6). > If therefore perfection were by the Levitical priesthood (for under it the > people received the law), what further need was there that another priest > should rise after the order of Melchizedek, and not be called after the > order of Aaron? For the priesthood being changed, there is made of necessity > a change also of the law\\" (Hebrews 7:11-12). The author of the Epistle to the Hebrews in the New Testament discussed this subject considerably, listing the following reasons for why the priesthood of Melchizedek is superior to the Aaronic priesthood: #Abraham paid tithes to Melchizedek; later, the Levites would receive tithes from their countrymen. Since Aaron was in Abraham's loins then, it was as if the Aaronic priesthood were paying tithes to Melchizedek. (Heb. 7:4-10) #The one who blesses is always greater than the one being blessed. Thus, Melchizedek was greater than Abraham. As Levi was yet in the loins of Abraham, it follows that Melchizedek is greater than Levi. (Heb. 7:7-10) #If the priesthood of Aaron were effective, God would not have called a new priest in a different order in Psalm 110. (Heb. 7:11) #The basis of the Aaronic priesthood was ancestry; the basis of the priesthood of Melchizedek is everlasting life. That is, there is no interruption due to a priest's death. (Heb. 7:8,15-16,23-25) #Christ, being sinless, does not need a sacrifice for his own sins. (Heb. 7:26-27) #The priesthood of Melchizedek is more effective because it required a single sacrifice once and for all (Jesus), while the Levitical priesthood made endless sacrifices. (Heb. 7:27) #The Aaronic priests serve (or, rather, served) in an earthly copy and shadow of the heavenly Temple, which Jesus serves in. (Heb. 8:5) The epistle goes on to say that the covenant of Jesus is superior to the covenant the Levitical priesthood is under. Some Christians hold that Melchizedek was a type of Christ, and some other Christians hold that Melchizedek indeed was Christ. Reasons provided include that Melchizedek's name means \\"king of righteousness\\" according to the author of Hebrews, and that being king of Salem makes Melchizedek the \\"king of peace\\". Heb. 7:3 states, \\"Without father or mother, without genealogy, without beginning of days or end of life, like the Son of God he (Melchizedek) remains a priest forever.\\" Melchizedek gave Abraham bread and wine, which some Christians consider symbols of the body and blood of Jesus Christ, the sacrifice to confirm a covenant. Catholicism Catholics find the roots of their priesthood in the tradition of Melchizedek (CCC 1544).Catechism of the Catholic Church : \\"The Christian tradition considers Melchizedek, 'priest of God Most High', as a prefiguration of the priesthood of Christ, the unique 'high priest after the order of Melchizedek'; 'holy, blameless, unstained',\\" In Genesis 14:18, Melchizedek offers a sacrifice of bread and wine. Christ therefore fulfilled the prophecy of Ps 110:4, that he would be a priest \\"after the order of Melchizedek\\" at the Last Supper, when he broke and shared bread with his disciples. Catholics interpret more literally Christ's commands that the Apostles should \\"do this in memory of Me\\" and \\"as often as you can\\". As such, the Catholic Church, at least once a day in every parish, offers the same sacrifice of bread and wine at Mass, as part of the Sacrament of the Eucharist. Latter Day Saint movement In the Latter Day Saint movement, the Melchizedek Priesthood is viewed as the priesthood authority of the Twelve Apostles of Jesus, as well as Old Testament prophets, higher than that of the Aaronic authority of John the Baptist and of the Levites. According to the Book of Mormon, the prophet Melchizedek preached repentance to the people of a wicked city, and established peace in the land. According to , Melchizedek's efforts earned him the title \\"the prince of peace\\". Of particular importance is the parallel Hebrew meaning of \\"prince of peace\\" and \\"king of Salem\\", another of Melchizedek's titles, and his association with (or typology of) Jesus Christ, who is also called the Prince of Peace (Isa. 9:2), as well as the Great High Priest (Heb. 4:14). Later, Melchizedek's people were, according to Joseph Smith, caught up, or \\"translated\\", to meet the city of Enoch (Joseph Smith Translation of Genesis 14:34). The priesthood is referred to by the name of Melchizedek because he was such a great high priest (Doctrine & Covenants ). The Doctrine and Covenants states that before Melchizedek's day the Priesthood \\"was called the Holy Priesthood, after the Order of the Son of God. But out of respect or reverence to the name of the Supreme Being, to avoid the too-frequent repetition of his name, they, the church, in the ancient days, called that priesthood after Melchizedek, or the Melchizedek Priesthood\\" (Doctrine and Covenants ). Initially, the only Melchizedek Priesthood office in the Latter Day Saint movement was Elder. Later revelations extended the office complement to Seventy, High Priest, Patriarch and Apostle.

The stimulus can be manual (brute force, placing pressure on painful areas, or use of painful hyperextension or hyperflexion on joints), use tools such as a whip or electroshock weapon, or use chemicals such as tear gas or pepper spray. The purpose of pain compliance is to direct the actions of the subject, and to this end, the pain is lessened or removed when compliance is achieved. This provides incentive to the subject to carry out the action required. Use in humans A common use in humans is as a law enforcement technique to assist with taking a suspect in to custody, control a suspect in custody or encourage action on behalf of a person who is passively resisting. In disciplined law enforcement, the use of pain compliance forms part of a use of force continuum which will usually start with verbal warnings, before escalating measures. Another common use of this technique is to physically compel chosen behavior, e.g. school-yard bullying or racketeerism, independent of any law enforcement process. The pain stimulus can be manual, using a pain compliance hold or can be through the use of weapons such as an electroshock weapon (Taser) or ballistic round. Pain compliance as part of an escalation of force policy normally presumes a rational adversary, but some altered states such as mental illness, phencyclidine and amphetamine use, or extreme adrenaline may alter the subject's perception of pain or willingness to submit. Like other forms of non-lethal force, such pain compliance strategies are not perfect and may be abused as a form of torture, with plausible deniability. For this reason the use of pain compliance is often subject to explicit rules of engagement designed to prevent abuse and avoid conflict escalation. Use in animals Pain compliance is used as a training aid in animals, with physical aids including the use of whips and shock collars.

Recording began at Polar Music Studios in Stockholm on 9 September 1980, with the final mix of the song being completed on 10 October 1980. \\"Lay All Your Love on Me\\" is known for a descending vocal sound at the end of the verse immediately preceding the refrain. This was achieved by sending the vocal into a harmoniser device, which was set up to produce a slightly lower-pitched version of the vocal. In turn its output was fed back to its input, thereby continually lowering the pitch of the vocal. Andersson and Ulvaeus felt that the chorus of the song sounded like a hymn, so parts of the vocals in the choruses were run through a vocoder, to recreate the sound of a church congregation singing, slightly out of tune.Palm, Carl Magnus: ABBA ‚Äì The Complete Recordings Sessions, page 101.

Environmental art has evolved away from formal concerns, worked out with earth as a sculptural material, towards a deeper relationship to systems, processes and phenomena in relationship to social concerns.Kastner, J. and Wallis, B.

Over the past ten years environmental art has become a focal point of exhibitions around the world as the social and cultural aspects of climate change come to the forefront. The term \\"environmental art\\" often encompasses \\"ecological\\" concerns but is not specific to them. It primarily celebrates an artist's connection with nature using natural materials. The concept is best understood in relationship to historic earth/Land art and the evolving field of ecological art. The field is interdisciplinary in the fact that environmental artists embrace ideas from science and philosophy. The practice encompasses traditional media, new media and critical social forms of production. The work embraces a full range of landscape/environmental conditions from the rural, to the suburban and urban as well as urban/rural industrial. History: landscape painting and representation Claude Monet, Waterloo Bridge, London It can be argued that environmental art began with the Paleolithic cave paintings of our ancestors. While no landscapes have (yet) been found, the cave paintings represented other aspects of nature important to early humans such as animals and human figures. \\"They are prehistoric observations of nature. In one-way or another, nature for centuries remained the preferential theme of creative art.\\" More modern examples of environmental art stem from landscape painting and representation. When artists painted onsite they developed a deep connection with the surrounding environment and its weather and brought these close observations into their canvases. John Constable's sky paintings \\"most closely represent the sky in nature\\". Monet's London Series also exemplifies the artist's connection with the environment. \\"For me, a landscape does not exist in its own right, since its appearance changes at every moment; but the surrounding atmosphere brings it to life, the air and the light, which vary continually for me, it is only the surrounding atmosphere that gives subjects their true value.\\" Diane Burko, Waters Glacier and Bucks, 2013 Contemporary painters, such as Diane Burko represent natural phenomena‚Äîand its change over time‚Äîto convey ecological issues, drawing attention to climate change. Alexis Rockman's landscapes depict a sardonic view of climate change and humankind's interventions with other species by way of genetic engineering.  Challenging traditional sculptural forms Robert Morris, Observatorium, Netherlands The growth of environmental art as a \\"movement\\" began in the late 1960s and early 1970s. In its early phases it was most associated with sculpture‚Äîespecially Site-specific art, Land art and Arte povera‚Äîhaving arisen out of mounting criticism of traditional sculptural forms and practices that were increasingly seen as outmoded and potentially out of harmony with the natural environment. In October 1968, Robert Smithson organized an exhibition at Dwan Gallery in New York titled ‚ÄúEarthworks.‚Äù The works in the show posed an explicit challenge to conventional notions of exhibition and sales, in that they were either too large or too unwieldy to be collected; most were represented only by photographs, further emphasizing their resistance to acquisition.Kastner, Jeffrey and Wallis, Brian (1998) Land and Environmental Art, London: Phaidon Press, p. 23, For these artists escaping the confines of the gallery and modernist theory was achieved by leaving the cities and going out into the desert. ‚ÄùThey were not depicting the landscape, but engaging it; their art was not simply of the landscape, but in it as well.‚ÄùBeardsley, p. 7 This shift in the late 1960s and 1970s represents an avant garde notion of sculpture, the landscape and our relationship with it. The work challenged the conventional means to create sculpture, but also defied more elite modes of art dissemination and exhibition, such as the Dwan Gallery show mentioned earlier. This shift opened up a new space and in doing so expanded the ways in which work was documented and conceptualized. Entering public and urban spaces Andrea Polli, Particle Falls, 2013 John Fekner, Toxic, Long Island Expressway, Maspeth, Queens, NY 1982 Circles of Time by Alan Sonfist - Florence, Italy (1986-89) (c) Marco Casagrande, Sandworm, Beaufort04 Triennial of Contemporary Art, Wenduine, Belgium, 2012 Just as the earthworks in the deserts of the west grew out of notions of landscape painting, the growth of public art stimulated artists to engage the urban landscape as another environment and also as a platform to engage ideas and concepts about the environment to a larger audience. While this earlier work was mostly created in the deserts of the American west, the end of the 1970s and the beginning of the 1980s saw works moving into the public landscape. Artists like Robert Morris began engaging county departments and public arts commissions to create works in public spaces such as an abandoned gravel pit.Beardsley, p. 90 Herbert Bayer used a similar approach and was selected to create his Mill Creek Canyon Earthworks in 1982. The project served functions such as erosion control, a place to serve as a reservoir during high rain periods, and a 2.5 acre park during dry seasons.Beardsley, p. 94 Lucy Lippard's groundbreaking book, on the parallel between contemporary land art and prehistoric sites, examined the ways in which these prehistoric cultures, forms and images have \\"overlaid\\" onto the work of contemporary artists working with the land and natural systems. Alan Sonfist introduced a key environmentalist idea of bringing nature back into the urban environment with his first historical Time Landscape sculpture, proposed to New York City in 1965, and visible to this day at the corner of Houston and LaGuardia in New York City's Greenwich Village. Environmental art also encompasses the scope of the urban landscape. Pioneering environmental artist, Mary Miss began creating art in the urban environment with her 1969 installation, Ropes/Shore, and continues to develop projects involving extended communities through City as a Living Laboratory. Agnes Denes created a work in downtown Manhattan Wheatfield - A Confrontation (1982) in which she planted a field of wheat on the two-acre site of a landfill covered with urban detritus and rubble. The site is now Battery Park City and the World Financial Center, a transformation from ecologic power to economic power. Andrea Polli's installation Particle Falls made particulate matter in the air visible in a way that passersby could see. For HighWaterLine Eve Mosher and others walked through neighborhoods in at-risk cities such as New York City and Miami, marking the projected flood damage which could occur as a result of climate change and talking with residents about what they were doing. Ecoart Milton Becerra, NIDOS, T√°chira River, Venezuela 1995.Book Analysis of a process over time - 2007 - Ecological art, also known as ecoart, is an artistic practice or discipline proposing paradigms sustainable with the life forms and resources of our planet. It is composed of artists, scientists, philosophers and activists who are devoted to the practices of ecological art. Historical precedents include Earthworks, Land Art, and landscape painting/photography. Ecoart is distinguished by a focus on systems and interrelationships within our environment: the ecological, geographic, political, biological and cultural. Ecoart creates awareness, stimulates dialogue, changes human behavior towards other species, and encourages the long-term respect for the natural systems we coexist with. It manifests as socially engaged, activist, community-based restorative or interventionist art. Ecological artist, Aviva Rahmani believes that \\"Ecological art is an art practice, often in collaboration with scientists, city planners, architects and others, that results in direct intervention in environmental degradation. Often, the artist is the lead agent in that practice.\\" There are numerous approaches to ecoart including but not limited to: representational artworks that address the environment through images and objects; remediation projects that restore polluted environments; activist projects that engage others and activate change of behaviors and/or public policy; time-based social sculptures that involves communities in monitoring their landscapes and taking a participatory role in sustainable practices; ecopoetic projects that initiate a re-envisioning and re-enchantment with the natural world, inspiring healing and co-existence with other species; direct-encounter artworks that involve natural phenomena such as water, weather, sunlight, or plants; pedagogical artworks that share information about environmental injustice and ecological problems such as water and soil pollution and health hazards; relational aesthetics that involve sustainable, off-the-grid, permaculture existences. There is discussion and debate among ecoartists, if ecological art should be considered a discrete discipline within the arts, distinct from environmental art. A current definition of ecological art, drafted collectively by the EcoArtNetwork is \\"Ecological art is an art practice that embraces an ethic of social justice in both its content and form/materials. Ecoart is created to inspire caring and respect, stimulate dialogue, and encourage the long-term flourishing of the social and natural environments in which we live. It commonly manifests as socially engaged, activist, community- based restorative or interventionist art.\\"Kagan, Sacha (2014). The practice of ecological art. [plastik] 4 . Available online at: http://art-science.univ- paris1.fr/plastik/document.php?id=866. . Artists who work in this field generally subscribe to one or more of the following principles: focus on the web of interrelationships in our environment‚Äîon the physical, biological, cultural, political, and historical aspects of ecological systems; create works that employ natural materials or engage with environmental forces such as wind, water, or sunlight; reclaim, restore, and remediate damaged environments; inform the public about ecological dynamics and the environmental problems we face; revise ecological relationships, creatively proposing new possibilities for coexistence, sustainability, and healing. Contributions by women in the area of EcoArt are significant, many are cataloged in WEAD, Women Environmental Artists Directory founded in 1995 by Jo Hanson, Susan Leibovitz Steinman and Estelle Akamine. The work of ecofeminist writers inspired early male and female practitioners to address their concerns about a more horizontal relationship to environmental issues in their own practices. The feminist art writer Lucy Lippard, writing for the Weather Report Show she curated in 2007 at the Boulder Museum of Contemporary Art, which included many environmental, ecological and ecofeminist artists, commented on how many of those artists were women. Considering environmental impact Robert Smithson, Spiral Jetty, 2005 herman de vries, Sanctuarium, Leibfriedschen Garten, Stuttgart, 2013 Within environmental art, a crucial distinction can be made between environmental artists who do not consider the possible damage to the environment that their artwork may incur, and those whose intent is to cause no harm to nature. For example, despite its aesthetic merits, the American artist Robert Smithson's celebrated sculpture Spiral Jetty (1969) inflicted permanent damage upon the landscape he worked with, using a bulldozer to scrape and cut the land, with the spiral itself impinging upon the lake. Similarly, criticism was raised against the European sculptor Christo when he temporarily wrapped the coastline at Little Bay, south of Sydney, Australia, in 1969. Conservationists' comments attracted international attention in environmental circles and led contemporary artists in the region to rethink the inclinations of land art and site-specific art. Sustainable art is produced with consideration for the wider impact of the work and its reception in relationship to its environments (social, economic, biophysical, historical, and cultural). Some artists choose to minimize their potential impact, while other works involve restoring the immediate landscape to a natural state. British sculptor Richard Long has for several decades made temporary outdoor sculptural work by rearranging natural materials found on site, such as rocks, mud and branches, which will therefore have no lingering detrimental effect. Chris Drury instituted a work entitled \\"Medicine Wheel\\" which was the fruit and result of a daily meditative walk, once a day, for a calendar year. The deliverable of this work was a mandala of mosaicked found objects: nature art as process art. Leading environmental artists such British artist and poet, Hamish Fulton, Dutch sculptor Herman de Vries, the Australian sculptor John Davis and the British sculptor Andy Goldsworthy similarly leave the landscape they have worked with unharmed; in some cases they have revegetated damaged land with appropriate indigenous flora in the process of making their work. In this way the work of art arises out of a sensitivity towards habitat. Perhaps the most celebrated instance of environmental art in the late 20th century was 7000 Oaks, an ecological action staged at Documenta during 1982 by Joseph Beuys, in which the artist and his assistants highlighted the condition of the local environment by planting 7000 oak trees throughout and around the city of Kassel. Ecological awareness and transformation Other eco-artists reflect on our human engagement with the natural world, and create ecologically informed artworks that focus on transformation or reclamation. Ecoart writer and theoretician Linda Weintraub coined the term, \\"cycle-logical\\" to describe the correlation between recycling and psychology. The 21st century notion of artists' mindful engagement with their materials harkens back to paleolithic midden piles of discarded pottery and metals from ancient civilizations. Weintraub cites the work of MacArthur Fellow Sarah Sze who recycles, reuses, and refurbishes detritus from the waste stream into elegant sprawling installations. Her self-reflective work draws our attention to our own cluttered lives and connection to consumer culture. Brigitte Hitschler's Energy field drew power for 400 red diodes from the to- be-reclaimed potash slag heap upon which they were installed, using art and science to reveal hidden material culture. Ecological artist and activist, Beverly Naidus, creates installations that address environmental crises, nuclear legacy issues, and creates works on paper that envision transformation. Her community-based permaculture project, Eden Reframed remediates degraded soil using phytoremediation and mushrooms resulting in a public place to grow and harvest medicinal plants and edible plants. Naidus is an educator having taught at the University of Washington, Tacoma for over ten years, where she created the Interdisciplinary Studio Arts in Community curriculum merging art with ecology and socially engaged practices. Naidus's book, Arts for Change: Teaching Outside the Frame is a resource for teachers, activists and artists. Sculptor and installation artist Erika Wanenmacher was inspired by Tony Price in her development of works addressing creativity, mythology, and New Mexico's nuclear presence. Various artists, have worked in different ways using living mold as an artistic element. Renewable energy sculpture Ralf Sander, World Saving Machine III, MoA Museum of Art, Seoul, South Korea Renewable energy sculpture is another recent development in environmental art. In response to the growing concern about global climate change, artists are designing explicit interventions at a functional level, merging aesthetical responses with the functional properties of energy generation or saving. Practitioners of this emerging area often work according to ecologically informed ethical and practical codes that conform to Ecodesign criteria. Andrea Polli Queensbridge Wind Power Project is an example of experimental architecture, incorporating wind turbines into a bridge's structure to recreate aspects of the original design as well as lighting the bridge and neighbouring areas. Ralf Sander's public sculpture, the World Saving Machine, used solar energy to create snow and ice outside the Seoul Museum of Art in the hot Korean summer.

Totopara is located at the foot of the Himalayas just to the south of the borderline between Bhutan and West Bengal (on the western bank of Torsa river). Geographically the location is 89¬∞ 20'E 26¬∞ 50'N. Totos were nearly becoming extinct in the 1950s, but recent measures to safeguard their areas from being swamped with outsiders have helped preserve their unique heritage and also helped the population grow. The total population of Totos according to 1951 census was 321 living in 69 different houses at Totopara. In 1991 census, the Toto population had increased to 926 who lived in 180 different houses. In the 2001 census, their number had increased to 1184 - all living in Totopara. Anthropologists agree that the Toto culture and language is totally unique to the tribe, and is clearly distinguished from the neighbouring Rajbongshis, Koch, Mech or the Bhutanese Sharchop tribes. Physical features and ethnic identity The Totos are considered as Mongoloid people, with flat nose, small eye, broad and square cheeks, thick lips and small eyes and black iris. Their complexion is rather on the darker side, which reflects their nearness to the equator. They are generally endogamous and marry within their own tribe. They are generally divided into 13 exogamous clans or groups of families from which they choose to marry. They do not marry anyone related to them through their paternal uncles or maternal aunts. Toto language belongs to Tibeto-Burman family of sub-Himalayan group, as classified by Hodgson and Grierson. A script was developed for the language by community elder Dhaniram Toto in 2015, and has seen limited but increasing use in literature, education, and computing; a proposal for encoding this script was accepted by the Unicode technical committee on October 8, 2019, and is currently awaiting ISO balloting. Most of the young members can speak Bengali and Nepali, which are the mediums of instruction in the local schools. Totopara: The Toto village The area of entire Toto country called Totopara is . It lies 22 km from Madarihat, the entrance of Jaldapara National Park. So, it can be safely assumed that the Totos live near the northern edges of this forest. The Toto localities of the village are sub-divided into six segments - Panchayatgaon, Mandolgaon, Subbagaon, Mitranggaon, Pujagaon and Dumchigaon. Totopara also has a settlement of Nepali-speaking people. A primary school was established in the village in 1990. Later in 1995, a high school with hostel facility was also established there. There is one primary healthcare centre in Totopara. Society Toto family is patrilocal in nature dominated by nuclear type. However, joint family is not rare. Monogamy is common form of marriage among the Toto but polygamy is not prohibited. If a man's wife dies, he may marry the deceased wife's younger sister, but a woman cannot marry her deceased husband's brother. On the death of a spouse, the husband or wife must remain single for twelve months before he or she is free to remarry. There are various ways of acquiring mates viz., (1) marriage by negotiation (Thulbehoea), (2) marriage by escape (Chor-behoea), (3) marriage by capture (Sambehoea) and (4) love marriage (Lamalami). There is no custom of divorce among the Totos. Food habits Though they make their main food from marua (a kind of millet), the staple food of the Totos now includes rice, chura (parched rice), milk and curd. They also eat meat, generally goat, pork, venison, poultry and fish of all kinds. Women eat the same food as men and there are no restrictions of any kind on the widows. Totos also drink a fermented liquor called Eu, made from fermented marua, rice powder and malt, which is served warm in Poipa (wooden glasses). Eu is drunk on all occasions. Houses thumbA traditional Toto hut at Totopara, West Bengal Totos live in elevated bamboo huts. These are raised on machas (raised platforms), and have straw thatches. There is a single log placed to get to the hut, and this log is meant to be drawn up at night. Religion They define themselves close to nature, they mainly perform Nature worship. The Totos have two main gods whom they worship: # Ishpa - He is supposed to live in the Bhutan hills, and causes sickness when displeased. The Totos offer him animal sacrifices and Eu. # Cheima - She keeps the village and its people safe from troubles and sicknesses. She is also offered rice, fowls and Eu. The Totos have priests, also offer their worship and sacrifices on their own. Ishpa is worshipped in the open outside the house and Cheima inside the house. Of late, there are a few Christian converts among the tribe, largely attributed to Christian missionary works. Economic activities Totos cultivate land. The Totos are not active farmers and hence do not cultivate a particular crop to a great extent. Every home has a kitchen garden surrounded by bamboo fences; in these gardens they grow vegetables, potatoes and bananas, among others. Sometimes they trade with traders from the outside world. Some Totos raise cows and pigs as an occupation. At different stages of history, the Toto tribe has been moving away from a subsistence economy to market economy. Further, the transformations of the village from community ownership of land to individual land holding and from isolated tribal group to a multi-ethnic habitat have also taken place in the recent past.

His version of Shakespeare's King Lear, the opera Lear, was written at the suggestion of Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau, who sang the title role. His opera Medea after Grillparzer's play premiered in 2010 at the Vienna State Opera. He was a professor of contemporary song in Hamburg and Berlin. In 2011, he was awarded the Ernst von Siemens Music Prize for his life's work. Life and career Reimann was born in Berlin. He studied composition, counterpoint and piano at the Musikhochschule Berlin with Boris Blacher and Ernst Pepping, among others. During his studies, he worked as a repetiteur at the St√§dtische Oper. His first appearances as a pianist and accompanist were in 1957. In the early 1970s, he became a member of the Akademie der K√ºnste in Berlin. He was professor of contemporary song at the Musikhochschule Hamburg from 1974 to 1983, then at Berlin's Hochschule der K√ºnste from 1983 to 1998. Reimann's reputation as a composer has increased greatly with several great literary operas, including Lear and Das Schlo√ü. Besides these, he has written chamber music, orchestral works and songs. He has been honoured repeatedly, including the Grand Cross of Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany and the Order of Merit of Berlin. Invited by Walter Fink, he was the seventh composer featured in the annual of the Rheingau Musik Festival in 1997, in songs and chamber music with the Auryn Quartet, playing the piano himself. His commissioned work, Cantus for Clarinet and Orchestra, dedicated to the clarinetist and composer J√∂rg Widmann, was premiered on January 13, 2006, in the WDR's Large Broadcasting Hall in Cologne, Germany, in the presence of the composer, who claims the work was inspired by Claude Debussy's compositions for clarinet. His opera Medea, after Franz Grillparzer, was premiered at the Vienna State Opera in 2010, conducted by Michael Boder, with Marlis Petersen in the title role. In 2011 he was awarded the Ernst von Siemens Music Prize \\"for his life's work\\".

History of codification The 23 sui iuris Churches which collectively make up the Eastern Catholic Churches have been invited by the Catholic Church to codify their own particular laws and submit them to the pope so that there may be a full, complete Code of all religious law within Catholicism. Pope John Paul II promulgated Code of Canons of the Eastern Churches on October 18, 1990, by the document Sacri Canones.AAS82 (1990) pp. 1033-1063 The Code came into force of law on October 1, 1991. Thomas Kuzhinapurath, Salvific Law: Salvific Character of CCEO, An Historical Overview, Malankara Seminary Publications, Trivandrum, 2008, p.79 Language The official language of the canon law common to all the Eastern Catholic Churches (called \\"common law\\") is Latin.John D. Faris, \\"Codifications of Eastern Canon Law\\", in A Practical Commentary to the Code of Canons of the Eastern Churches, ed. John D. Faris & Jobe Abbass, OFM Conv., cxxvi. Although Latin is the language of the Latin Church and not of the Eastern Churches, Latin was chosen as the language of the common law because there is no common language in use among all the Eastern Catholic Churches. The members of these churches use a diversity of languages, including Greek, Arabic, Romanian, Malayalam, English, French, Spanish, and Portuguese, but no single one of these languages could be used as the language of the common law. Latin was chosen because it has a long history of legal and juridical tradition and was suitable for serving as the common text from which translations could be made. Emendations=Ad Tuendam Fidem In 1998, Pope John Paul II issued the motu proprio Ad Tuendam Fidem, which amended two canons (750 and 1371) of the 1983 Code of Canon Law and two canons (598 and 1436) of the Code of Canons of the Eastern Churches, so as to add \\"new norms which expressly impose the obligation of upholding truths proposed in a definitive way by the Magisterium of the Church, and which also establish related canonical sanctions.\\" Mitis et Misericors Iesus On 15 August 2015, Pope Francis issued the motu proprio Mitis et Misericors Iesus which amended canons 1357-1377 of the CCEO.Apostolic Letter Motu Prioprio of the Supreme Pontiff Francis Mitis et Misericors Iesus by which the Canons of the Code of Canons of the Eastern Churches Pertaining to Cases Regarding the Nullity of Marriage are Reformed It reformed the procedures for matrimonial nullity trials and instituted a briefer process.Vatican Radio, Pope Francis reforms Church law in marital nullity trials, accessed 6 May 2020.  Titles  The text of the CCEO is divided into 31 sections, 30 titles and a section of preliminary canons.  Preliminary Canons  The 6 preliminary canons deal with scope and continuity, what is affected by the CCEO and how prior legislation and customs shall be handled. Can. 1 The CCEO regards solely the Eastern Catholic Churches unless otherwise mentioned. Can. 2 The CCEO is to be assessed according to the Ancient Laws of the Eastern Churches. Can. 3 The CCEO does not \\"for the most part legislate on liturgical matters\\" and therefore the Liturgical Books are to be observed unless contrary to the Canons of the CCEO. Can. 4. The CCEO neither degrades or abrogates treaties/pacts entered into by the Holy See with nations/political societies. Therefore, they still have their force, notwithstanding any prescriptions of the CCEO to the contrary.  The Rights and Obligations of All the Christian Faithful  This section defines the Christian faithful and catechumens. It expresses that the People of God have the obligation to: maintain the faith and openly profess the Faith, maintain communion, promote the growth of the Church, listen to pastors, let pastors know their opinions on matters of the good of the Church, call private associations 'Catholic' only when approved by the bishop, preserve the good reputation and privacy of all people, help with the needs of the Church and promote social justice including providing aid to the poor from their own resources. It also expresses various rights of the faithful. The canons in this section are numbered 7-26.  Churches Sui Iuris and Rites  A church sui iuris is \\"a community of the Christian faithful, which is joined together by a hierarchy according to the norm of law and which is expressly or tacitly recognized as sui iuris by the supreme authority of the Church\\" (CCEO.27) . The term sui iuris is an innovation of CCEO (Codex Canonum Ecclesiarum Orientalium - Code of Canons of the Oriental Churches) and denotes the relative autonomy of the Oriental Catholic Churches. This canonical term, pregnant with many juridical nuances, indicates the God-given mission of the Oriental Catholic Churches to preserve their patrimonial autonomous nature. The autonomy of these churches is relative in the sense that they are under the authority of the Bishop of Rome. According to the CCEO the Oriental Catholic Churches sui iuris are of 4 categories: 1\\\\. Patriarchal Churches: The patriarchal church is the full-grown form of an Oriental Catholic Church. It is a community of the Christian faithful joined together by a patriarchal hierarchy. The patriarch together with the synod of bishops has the legislative, judicial and administrative powers within the ecclesiastical territory, without prejudice to those powers reserved, in the common law to the pope (CCEO 55-150). Among the Catholic Oriental churches the following hold patriarchal status: Maronite, Chaldean, Coptic, Syriac, Melkite, Armenian. 2\\\\. Major Archiepiscopal Churches: Major archiepiscopal churches are those oriental churches which are governed by major archbishops, assisted by a respective synod of bishops. These churches have almost the same rights and obligations of patriarchal churches. A major archbishop is the metropolitan of a see; he is chosen by the pope or recognized by him, and presides over an entire Eastern Church sui iuris. What is stated in common law concerning patriarchal churches or patriarchs is understood to be applicable to major archiepiscopal churches or major archbishops, unless the common law expressly provides otherwise or the matter is obvious. (CCEO.151, 152). The 4 major archiepiscopal churches are the Syro-Malabar, the Ukrainian Byzantine, the Syro-Malankara Catholic and Romanian Byzantine. 3\\\\. Metropolitan Churches: This is a church which is governed by a metropolitan \\"sui iuris.\\" Such a church is presided over by the metropolitan of a determined see who has been canonically elected and confirmed by the pope. He is assisted by a council of hierarchs according to the norms of law (CCEO. 155¬ß1). The Catholic metropolitan churches are the Ethiopian Catholic, Eritrean Catholic, Hungarian Byzantine, Slovak Byzantine and the Ruthenian Catholic Church. 4\\\\. Other Churches: Apart from the above-mentioned forms of church there are other ecclesiastical communities which are entrusted to a hierarch who presides in accordance with the norms of canon law. (CCEO. 174). The following Oriental Catholic churches are of this status: Belorussian Greek, Bulgarian Greek, Macedonian Greek, Greek Byzantine, Italo-Albanian, Byzantine Church of the Eparchy of Kri≈ævci, Albanian Byzantine, Russian Byzantine. Altogether there are 22 oriental sui iuris churches in within the Catholic communion.

He founded the city of Beaumont, Texas, in 1835 and fought in the Battle of San Jacinto in 1836 during the Texas Revolution.  Early life  Millard was born in Stillwater, New York, to Josiah and Nancy (Tower) Millard in about 1796. In 1804 his family moved to Ste. Genevieve, Missouri, and then downriver in the 1820s to Natchez, Mississippi. On August 24, 1826, Millard married Mary Dewburleigh Barlace Warren Beaumont, the daughter of William Henry Beaumont and Elizabeth (Duncan) Beaumont of Natchez. The Millards' first son, Frederick Sipe Millard, was born in 1827. That same year the father opened a store with his brother-in-law, Franklin Beaumont. They sold medicine, toy trains, books, and stationery. In 1832 Millard moved his family to New Orleans, where he started a drug firm with a man named Samuel Mason. Mason died in 1833, which caused difficulties for the firm. During that same year Millard's second son, Henry Beaumont Millard, was born. Millard's wife Mary died in 1834. Millard formed a new partnership with Joseph Pulsifer and Thomas Huling.  Texas  Millard left his sons with foster parents in New Orleans and moved to Texas in 1835. He and his business partner Pulsifer opened a store in the settlement of Santa Anna, while the third partner, Huling, opened a store in Zavalla. The three of them decided to invest in land. They purchased of land between the settlements of Tevis Bluff and Santa Anna. On that land they laid out the town of Beaumont, which Millard apparently named after Jefferson Beaumont. As a delegate to the Consultation of 1835 in San Felipe, he helped found the municipality of Jefferson, which later became Jefferson County. He was elected to the General Council of the Consultation, but resigned in order to accept a commission as a lieutenant colonel in the Texas revolutionary army.  Military career  At first, Millard acted as a recruiting officer in Nacogdoches, Texas. Then in 1836 he went with General Sam Houston to a conference with the Cherokee people. A short time later he took command of a battalion and marched them to San Jacinto, where they fought on April 21, 1836, in the successful battle against the Mexican forces under President Antonio Lopez de Santa Anna. In his report of the battle, Houston wrote :The artillery under the special command of Col. Geo. W. Hockley Inspector Gen'l. was placed on the right of the first Regiment; and four companies of Infantry under the command of Lieut Col. Henry Millard, sustained the artillery upon the right. After the battle, Houston gave Millard two pistols that had belonged to Santa Anna. Millard‚Äôs descendants later loaned them to the Republic of Texas Museum where they reside today.  Public service  Millard acted as the chief justice of Jefferson County from 1838-1840. He was an alderman for the city of Beaumont and a justice of the peace. In 1842 he moved to Galveston, Texas, to explore new business possibilities and became the tax assessor for Galveston County.  Death and legacy  Millard suffered a series of illnesses and died on August 28 or 29, 1844. His remains were buried in the Episcopal Cemetery on Broadway. An historical marker outlining the life of Millard was dedicated in 1991 in the city of Beaumont. It is located at 800 Pearl Street. At the Battleground Golf Course in Deer Park, Texas, the thirteenth hole is named \\"Millard\\" in his honor.

Background  The Bosnian war which lasted from 1992 to 1995 was fought among its three main ethnicities Bosniaks, Croats and Serbs. Whilst the Bosniak plurality had sought a nation state solely for Bosniaks, the Croats had created an autonomous community that functioned independently of central Bosnian rule, and the Serbs declared independence for the region's eastern and northern regions relevant to the Serb population. All peace plans were proposed with the view to observing Bosnia and Herzegovina as a sovereign state entire of its territorial integrity (as it had been in Yugoslavia as the SR Bosnia and Herzegovina) and without an imbalance of greater devolution and autonomy awarded to any community or region.  Carrington‚ÄìCutileiro plan  The Carrington-Cutilero Peace Plan (green: Bosniak cantons, red: Serb cantons, blue: Croat cantons) The original Carrington‚ÄìCutileiro peace plan, named for its authors Lord Carrington and Portuguese ambassador Jos√© Cutileiro, resulted from the EC Peace Conference held in February 1992 in an attempt to prevent Bosnia-Herzegovina sliding into war. It was also referred to as the Lisbon Agreement (). It proposed ethnic power-sharing on all administrative levels and the devolution of central government to local ethnic communities. However, all Bosnia-Herzegovina's districts would be classified as Bosniak, Serb or Croat under the plan, even where no ethnic majority was evident. In later negotiations, there were compromises about changing district borders. On 3 March 1992, Bosnia and Herzegovina was declared independent following a referendum held days earlier on February 29 and 1 March. On 11 March 1992, the Assembly of the Serb People of Republika Srpska (the self-proclaimed parliament of the Bosnian Serbs) unanimously rejected the original peace plan, putting forth their own map which claimed almost two thirds of Bosnia's territory, with a series of ethnically split cities and isolated enclaves and leaving the Croats and Bosniaks with a disjointed strip of land in the centre of the republic. That plan was rejected by Cutileiro. However, he put forth a revised draft of the original which stated that the three constituent units would be \\"based on national principles and taking into account economic, geographic, and other criteria.\\" On 18 March 1992, all three sides signed the agreement; Alija Izetbegoviƒá for the Bosniaks, Radovan Karad≈æiƒá for the Bosnian Serbs and Mate Boban for the Bosnian Croats. On 28 March 1992, after a meeting with US ambassador to Yugoslavia Warren Zimmermann in Sarajevo, Izetbegoviƒá withdrew his signature and declared his opposition to any division of Bosnia. What was said and by whom remains unclear. Warren Zimmermann denied that he told Izetbegoviƒá that if he withdrew his signature, the United States would grant recognition to Bosnia as an independent state. What is indisputable is that on the same day Izetbegoviƒá withdrew his signature and renounced the agreement.  Vance‚ÄìOwen Peace Plan thumbFirst version of the Vance-Owen plan, which would have established 10 provinces In early January 1993, the UN Special Envoy Cyrus Vance and EC representative Lord Owen began negotiating a peace proposal with the leaders of Bosnia's warring factions. The proposal, which became known as the \\"Vance-Owen peace plan\\", involved the division of Bosnia into ten semi-autonomous regions and received the backing of the UN. The President of the Republika Srpska, Radovan Karad≈æiƒá, signed the plan on 30 April. However, it was rejected by the National Assembly of Republika Srpska on 6 May, and subsequently referred to a referendum.Bosnian Serbs Spurn Un Pact, Set Referendum Chicago Trubune, 6 May 1993 The plan was rejected by 96% of voters,Republika Srpska (Bosnien-Herzegowina), 16. Mai 1993 : Vance-Owen-Friedensplan Direct Democracy although mediators referred to the referendum as a \\"sham\\". On 18 June, Lord Owen declared that the plan was \\"dead\\". Given the pace at which territorial division, fragmentation and ethnic cleansing had occurred, the plan was already obsolete by the time it was announced. It became the last proposal that sought to salvage a mixed, united Bosnia-Herzegovina; subsequent proposals either re-enforced or contained elements of partition of Bosnia and Herzegovina. On 1 April, Cyrus Vance announced his resignation as Special Envoy to the UN Secretary-General. He was replaced by Norwegian Foreign Minister Thorvald Stoltenberg on 1 May. The Vance‚ÄìOwen plan was a roughly sketched map, it did not establish the definitive outline of the 10 cantons and depended on final negotiations between the three ethnic groups taking place.  Owen‚ÄìStoltenberg plan  Owen‚ÄìStoltenberg plan. In late July, representatives of Bosnia-Herzegovina's three warring factions entered into a new round of negotiations. On 20 August, the U.N. mediators Thorvald Stoltenberg and David Owen unveiled a map that would partition Bosnia into three ethnic mini-states, in which Bosnian Serb forces would be given 52 percent of Bosnia-Herzegovina's territory, Muslims would be allotted 30 percent and Bosnian-Herzegovina Croats would receive 18 percent. On 29 August 1993 the Bosniak side rejected the plan.  Contact Group plan  Between February and October 1994, the Contact Group (U.S., Russia, France, Britain, and Germany) made steady progress towards a negotiated settlement of the conflict in Bosnia-Herzegovina. This was known as a Contact Group plan, and a heavy pressure was put on Bosnian Serbs to accept the plan when Federal Republic of Yugoslavia imposed an embargo on Drina river. It was also rejected in a referendum held on 28 August 1994.Republika Srpska (Bosnien-Herzegowina), 28.

In 1890 Colchester Excelsior merged into the club. The club played in the Colchester Borough League, which they won in 1894‚Äì95 but then withdrew at the end of the season. In 1899 the club was renamed Colchester Town and entered the North Essex League, in which they played for two seasons, winning it in both. They returned to the Borough League in 1901. Despite almost folding after losing their ground in 1902, they finished as runners-up in 1902‚Äì03, by which time the league had been renamed the Colchester & District League. At the end of the season they also joined the South East Anglian League, which they played in until 1910, winning it in 1906‚Äì07. The following season they won the Colchester & District League. In 1910 they joined the South Essex League, continuing to play in the Essex & Suffolk Border League (as the Colchester & District League had been renamed in 1911), and also rejoined the East Anglian League (formerly the South East Anglian League) in 1912. In 1912‚Äì13 they were champions of all three leagues, and retained the East Anglian League title the following season.

Officials at the club were against the idea, resulting in a new professional club, Colchester United, being formed in March 1937, which would also play at Layer Road. United joined the Southern League and crowds at Town matches quickly dwindled. In December United formed a reserve team, signing many Town players. As a result of this and financial problems (the club were ¬£300 in debt), they folded in the same month. Grounds The club initially played at Cambridge Road, a ground which was shared by the local lacrosse club. In 1902 the ground was built on, so the club moved to Reed Hall, not playing a home match in the 1902‚Äì03 season until 6 December. In 1903‚Äì04 they played at Drury Lodge on the junction of Drury Road and Maldon Road. The following season they moved to Spaldings Meadow in Albert Road, before moving to the Oval in Sheepen Road in 1908. A brief period at the Oval in Water Lane was followed by a move to Layer Road in April 1903. The ground had been the home of the 4th Battalion King's Royal Rifle Corps team since 1906. During World War I the ground was handed over to the army for use as a drill ground. Seven Town players were killed in action during the great war, a tablet with their names inscribed on it was hung in the changing rooms. They were: *Lieutenant Charles Carrington (Durham Light Infantry, 5th Btn) *Private Will Chaplin (Suffolk Regiment, 4th Btn) *Sgt T E Ellison *Lance Corporal Albert Edward Pitchford (Royal Suffolk Regiment, 2nd Btn) *Acting Bombardie Arthur Knox (Royal Horse Artillery, 1st/1st Essex Bde) *AB W Boyle *Sapper T W Bagley (Royal Engineers, \\"L\\" Signal Bn). In 1919 the club bought the ground. The main stand (which remained until the ground closed) was opened in 1933. After the club folded, Colchester United took over the ground, where they remained until moving to the Colchester Community Stadium in 2008.

Senanayake's tenures as prime minister were associated with democratic socialist policies focused on agricultural and educational reforms with a pro-western alignment. Early life and family Dudley Senanayake was born on 19 June 1911 to the wealthy Senanayake family which was at the time becoming active in local colonial-era politics. His paternal grandfather Mudaliyar Don Spater Senanayake established the family wealth through graphite mining, which he later expanded into plantations and investments in the arrack renting franchise.Nobodies to Somebodies: The Rise of the Colonial Bourgeoisie in Sri Lanka, Kumari Jayawardena, pp. 192-3 & 267 (Zed) His parents were Don Stephen Senanayake and Molly Dunuwila. He was the eldest in the family with a younger brother Robert. His father D. S. Senanayake, who was engaged in the family business at the time of his birth, along with his brothers (Dudley's uncles) F. R. Senanayake and D.C. Senanayake were active in the temperance movement. Following the early death of F. R. Senanayake, D. S. Senanayake took over his role in the local politics, becoming a legislator and eventually leading the island's independence movement and becoming the first Prime Minister of Ceylon and founder the United National Party which is still one of the main political parties in Sri Lanka and of which Dudley would become a lifelong member. He grew up in the comfortable family home Woodlands, but was greatly effected by the events of the 1915 riots when his father was arrested by Punjabi soldiers. Imprisoned by the British military, his father and uncles faced the possibility of execution under martial law.Dudley Senanayake‚Äôs 84th Birth Anniversary Never marrying, he remained a lifelong bachelor. Education Dudley received his secondary education at the prestigious S. Thomas' College, where he excelled in his studies and sports. He became the Head Prefect, captained the college team at cricket at the Royal-Thomian and gained colours in hockey, boxing, and athletics. He won the Victoria Gold Medal for the most outstanding student at S. Thomas'. Senanayake then went on to Corpus Christi College, Cambridge to read for Natural Science Tripos and after graduation gained admission to the Middle Temple as a Barrister. Political career=State Council After returning to Ceylon in 1935, Dudley took oaths as an Advocate of the Supreme Court of Ceylon and briefly embanked on a legal practice under H. V. Perera, KC before entering politics on his father's urging. He was elected from the Dedigama electorate in 1936 to the State Council, while his father was Minister of Agriculture and served as a back-bencher for ten years. As State Councillor of Dedigama, he undertook much development work in his electorate developing roads, hospitals, schools and police stations. During this time he became active in the Ceylon National Congress (CNC) having been appointed in December 1939 as its joint secretary with J. R. Jayewardene another young lawyer who had been elected to the Colombo Municipal Council. The CNC was urging for the independence of Ceylon to the extent his father, D. S. Senanayake resigned from the congress because he disagreed with its revised aim of achieving full freedom from the British Empire, preferring Dominion status and its inclusion of Marxists.SRI LANKA: THE UNTOLD STORY, Chapter 10: Lord Soulbury and his soulless report By K T Rajasingham, Retrieved 11-06-2015 Following his father's resignation, Dudley succeeded his father as Minister of Agriculture and Lands in the second board of ministers of the state council in 1946. Minister of Agriculture and Lands The first Cabinet of Ministers of Ceylon in 1947 Taking on his father's ministry he carried forward many of the agricultural projects initiated by him such as the Minneriya irrigation project. Contesting in the 1947 general elections from the Dedigama electorate, he was elected to the first parliament of independent Ceylon and was appointed to the cabinet as Minister of Agriculture and Lands by his father, D. S. Senanayake who became the first Prime Minister of Ceylon in 1947. He continued many of the agricultural projects he started in his first year and started the ambitious Gal Oya Project which provided water for the cultivation of over 120,000 acres. He initiated guaranteed price scheme for paddy and farmers. He received the portfolios of Health and Local Government when S. W. R. D. Bandaranaike resigned and crossed over to the opposition. Second Prime Minister of Ceylon He was still serving as agriculture minister when his father died unexpectedly. Four days later, on 26 March 1952, to the surprise of many, Dudley was chosen as prime minister by the Governor- General Lord Soulbury over his cousin Sir John Kotelawala. He called a general election, which the UNP won. The government became unpopular a year later, in 1953, when the price of rice was raised and subsidies were cut. Though the UNP remained in power, the Hartal 1953 greatly effected the administration and Senanayake personally, he resigned as prime minister on health grounds in October, leaving politics and the public limelight. Return to politics In 1954, he accompanied his successor Sir John Kotelawala and the leader of the opposition S.W.R.D. Bandaranaike on a state visit to India on Sir John's invitation. He returned to politics in 1957 when the UNP lost elections and was appointed President of the UNP. He supported the efforts of J. R. Jayewardene in establishing UNP trade unions known as Jatika Sevaka Sangamayas and opposed nationalization of insurance companies and the Colombo port by Bandaranaike. Following the assassination of Bandaranaike in 1959, the caretaker prime minister Wijeyananda Dahanayake called for elections after a year of turmoil. In March 1960, the UNP managed to form a government after elections and Senanayake became prime minister again, but the coalition fragmented and Dudley resigned as prime minister after only four months in office after new elections were held in which the UNP won fewer seats. He became the leader of the opposition and help force early elections in 1965 by persuading 14 supporters of Prime Minister Sirimavo Bandaranaike to defect. Third term as Prime Minister Hillwood Girls' College Kandy Senanayake was able to form a government following the 1965 elections and served his longest term as prime minister from March 1965 to May 1970. He had narrowly missed an assassination attempt on 23 March 1965, when a bomb was thrown into Esmond Wickremesinghe house moments after Senanayake had left the premises while negotiations were underway to form a government. His government originally consisted of six other parties and included both Tamil and Sinhalese nationalists. Much of his term was carryout under a state of emergency (since January 1966) due to sporadic occurrences of communal violence, however Senanayake was able to control these effectively and was able to give Tamil language official status in Tamil speaking areas, which became step closer to address the grievances of the Tamil community on language after S.W.R.D. Bandaranaike had replaced Sinhalese as the official language replacing English. He established the Poya holiday, the day of Buddhist sabbath and rendered formal recognition for the Mahanayaka theros. He established a University for Bhikkus in Anuradhapura. He undertook many educational reforms, expanding vocation education by setting up the Ceylon College of Technology, Katubedda in 1966 and six Junior University Colleges in 1969. In 1966, his government claimed an attempted coup d'√©tat and the commander of the commander of the army and several military personnel were arrested. They were later acquitted of a plot to overthrow the legally elected government, which greatly discredited the Senanayake administration along with the bribery trail of Dr Mackie Ratwatte, brother and former personal secretary of Sirimavo Bandaranaike.SRI LANKA: The Untold Story, Chapter 21 - A further lack of perspicuity He paid a private visit to the United States for treatment at Walter Reed Hospital, during which he met President Lyndon Johnson, who informed no large scale aid would be provided by the United States to Ceylon. He stopped off at London, but was forced to return to Ceylon following rumors of his impending death. His government has been credited with restoring the Sri Lankan economy. He initiated planning for the most ambitious construction projects in Sri Lanka, the Mahaweli Development programme. His administration initiated the expansion of the tourist industry which in later years became a major source of foreign exchange and employment in Sri Lanka. However, he and his allies were defeated in the 1970 elections.Four times Prime Minister of Sri Lanka . PM's of Sri Lanka . Later life In the 1970 elections, the UNP won the largest vote share of any individual party. However, the UNP was thrown from office after the United Front coalition (SLFP, LSSP, and the Communists) lead by Sirimavo Bandaranaike won a large majority of 91 seats. Senanayake retained his Dedigama seat in the election, which was one of the few rural seats won by the UNP in the election. Although he remained a member of parliament and active in politics, he did not accept the post of leader of the opposition for health reasons, allowing J. R. Jayewardene to serve as leader of the opposition and become de facto leader of the UNP. He died aged 62 while being member of parliament for Dedigama on 13 April 1973 due to a heart ailment. Since his Cambridge days he had suffered from a stomach ailment that was only diagnosed later as a birth defect which got aggravated when under stress.Dudley Senanayake Dies at 57; Was Prime Minister of Ceylon Legacy Dudley Senanayake, is respected by most Sri Lankan as a statesman of simplicity, democratic toleration and moderation. He is remembered for carrying forward his father's legacy; specially in the areas of agricultural reforms and large scale projects, introducing his own and initiating more such as the Mahaweli development programme. His foreign policy was pro-western, yet he maintained good relations with communist countries such as China establishing the Ceylon-China Trade Agreement of 1952.The Significance of the Ceylon-China Trade Agreement of 1952 Statues of Dudley Senanayake have been erected in many parts of the island, including one at the Old Parliament Building, Colombo and many schools, libraries and public buildings have been named in his honor.

History In 1216 a small number of monks from the Hocht part of Lanaken, near Maastricht, settled in the uninhabited valley which formed the border between the Duchy of Limburg and the county of Dalhem; they called their settlement Vallis Dei (; ). The abbey's original church was destroyed in 1287 during the War of the Limburg Succession. The church was rebuilt, but was destroyed again in 1574 during the Eighty Years' War, and in 1683 by the armies of Louis XIV. Under the jurisdiction of Abbot Jean Dubois, from 1711 until 1749, the abbey flourished. It was dissolved during the French Revolution, when the church was destroyed for the fourth time. The remaining buildings were left empty until 1844, when they were resettled by the last living monk of Val-Dieu from the time before the Revolution, together with four monks from Bornem Abbey. The abbey was closed again in 2001, when the last three monks left. Since 1 January 2002 a small lay community has lived there, under the leadership of rector Jean-Pierre Schenkelaars, overseen by the regional ecclesiastical authorities, in association with the Cistercian Order. Brewery In 1997 the Brasserie de l'Abbaye du Val-Dieu was established in the abbey farm, and brews a range of abbey beers in the tradition of the former Val-Dieu monks. Their range includes a Belgian blonde (6%), brune (8%), triple (9%), as well as a grand cru (10.5%).

A military leader, he arrived at the north coast of the island bringing with him many settlers from various towns in Achaea. One such town, located near present-day Aigio in the Peloponnese, was also called Kyrenia. The earliest reference made to the town of Kyrenia is found, together with that of the other seven city kingdoms of Cyprus, in Egyptian scripts dating from the period of Ramesses III, c. 1186‚Äì1155 BC. From its early days of settlement, Kyrenia's commerce and maritime trade benefited enormously from its proximity to the Asia Minor coast. Boats set sail from the Aegean islands, travelled along the Asia Minor coast, and then crossed over the short distance to the northern shores of Cyprus to reach the two city kingdoms of Lapithos and Kyrenia. This lively maritime activity (late 4th or early 3rd century BC) is evident in an ancient shipwreck discovered by Andreas Kariolou in 1965, just outside Kyrenia harbour. The vessel's route along Samos, Kos, Rhodes, the Asia Minor coastline and then Kyrenia, demonstrates the town's close maritime relations with other city kingdoms in the eastern Mediterranean. During the succession struggle between Ptolemy and Antigonus that followed Alexander the Great's death in 323 BC, Kyrenia was subdued under the rule of the kingdom of Lapithos that allied itself with Antigonus. Once the Ptolemies were successful in dominating the whole island, all city kingdoms were abolished. Kyrenia however, because of its maritime trade, continued to prosper. In the 2nd century BC, it is cited as one of six Cypriot towns which were benefactors to the Oracle at Delphi, that is, it received its special representatives who collected contributions and gifts. The town's prosperity at this time is also evident from its two temples, one dedicated to Apollo and the other to Aphrodite, and from the rich archeological finds dating from the Hellenistic period excavated within the present-day town limits. The Romans succeeded the Ptolemies as rulers of Cyprus and during this time Lapithos became the administrative centre of the district. The numerous tombs excavated and the rich archeological finds dating from this period indicate however, that Kyrenia continued to be a populous and prosperous town. An inscription found at the base of a limestone statue dating from 13-37 AD, refers to \\"Kyrenians Demos\\" that is, the town's inhabitants. Here the Romans left their mark by constructing a castle with a seawall in front of it so that boats and ships could anchor in safety. Christianity found fertile ground in the area. The first Christian martyrs used the old quarries of Chrysokava, just east of Kyrenia castle, as catacombs and cut-rock cemeteries which are considered among the island's most important remains from this period. Later, some of these caves were converted into churches and feature beautiful iconography, the most representative of which is that found at Ayia Mavri. From these early days, the town of Kyrenia was an episcopal see. One of its first bishops, Theodotus, was arrested and tortured between 307‚Äì324, under the reign of Licinius. The persecution of Christians officially ended in 313, when Constantine I and his co-emperor, Licinius, issued the Edict of Milan, which mandated toleration of Christians in the Roman Empire and freedom of worship. The martyrdom of Theodotus, however, occurred in 324 and it is this event that the Church annually commemorates on March 2. Medieval Ages With the division of the Roman empire into an eastern and western empire, in 395 Cyprus came under the Byzantine emperors and the Greek Orthodox Church. The Byzantine emperors fortified Kyrenia's Roman castle and in the 10th century, they constructed in its vicinity a church dedicated to St. George, which the garrison used as a chapel. Then, when in 806, Lambousa was destroyed in the Arab raids, Kyrenia grew in importance because its castle and garrison offered its inhabitants protection and security. Isaac Komnenos of Cyprus, the island's last Byzantine governor, sent his family and treasures to the castle for safety in 1191 when King Richard I of England of England went to war with him. However, Richard defeated Comnenus and became the island's new master. King Richard's rule was not welcomed in Cyprus so he sold the island first to the Templars, and then in 1192, to Guy of Lusignan. Under Frankish rule, the villages of the district of Kyrenia became feudal estates and the town became once again the administrative and commercial centre for its region. The Lusignans enlarged the castle, built a wall and towers around the town, and extended the fortifications to the harbour. They also fortified the Byzantine castles of Saint Hilarion, Bouffavento and Kantara, which, together with Kyrenia Castle, protected the town from land and sea attacks. Kyrenia castle played a pivotal role in the island's history during the many disputes among the Frankish kings, as well as the conflicts with the Genoese. On numerous occasions the castle came under siege, but it never capitulated. In 1489, Cyprus came under Venetian rule. The Venetians modified Kyrenia Castle to meet the threat that the use of gunpowder and cannons posed. The castle's royal quarters and three of its four thin and elegant Frankish towers were demolished and replaced by thickset circular towers that could better withstand cannon fire. These new towers, however, were never put to the test. In 1571, the castle and the town surrendered to the Ottoman army. Kyrenia Under Ottoman Rule Under Ottoman rule, Kyrenia district was at first one of four, then one six, administrative districts of the island and the town remained its administrative capital. The town's fortunes declined however as it was transformed into a garrison town. The Christian population was expelled from the fortified city, and no one was allowed to reside within the castle other than the artillerymen and their families. These men terrorized the town's inhabitants and those of the surrounding villages, Christian and Muslim alike, with their arbitrary looting and crimes. The few local inhabitants who dared to stay were merchants and fishermen whose livelihood depended on the sea. They built their homes outside the city wall, which through time, neglect and disrepair, turned to ruin. The rest of the inhabitants moved further out to the area known as Pano Kyrenia or the ‚ÄòRiatiko' (so called because it once belonged to a king) or fled further inland and to the mountain villages of Thermeia, Karakoumi, Kazafani, Bellapais and Karmi. The town revived again when bribes and gifts paid to local Turkish officials caused them to permit local maritime trade with Asia Minor and the Aegean islands to resume. In 1783, the church of Chrysopolitissa was renovated. Then in 1856, following the Hatt-I-Humayum, which introduced social and political reform and greater religious freedom for the various peoples of the Ottoman Empire, the church of Archangel Michael was rebuilt on a rocky mount overlooking the sea. At about this time, many of the Christian inhabitants of the surrounding villages reestablished themselves in the town. Local agriculture and maritime trade, particularly the export of carobs to Asia Minor, allowed the people of Kyrenia to have a comfortable living, and some even to educate their children and pursue other cultural activities. Under British Rule In 1878, following a secret agreement between the British and Ottoman governments, the island was ceded to Great Britain as a military base in the eastern Mediterranean. At first, Great Britain did not undertake major administrative changes, so Kyrenia remained the district's capital. A road was constructed through the mountain pass to connect the town to the island's capital, Nicosia, and the harbour was repaired and expanded to accommodate increasing trade with the opposite coast. The town's municipal affairs were put in order and the municipal council took an active role in cleaning and modernizing the town. In 1893, a hospital was built through private contributions and effort. By the 1900s (decade), Kyrenia was a buzzing little town with a new school building, its own newspaper, social, educational and athletic clubs. It was also a favoured vacation spot for many wealthy Nicosia families. Many homes were converted into pensions and boarding houses and in 1906, the first hotel, The ‚ÄòAkteon,' was built by the sea. These first decades of British rule however, also saw increased economic hardship for the population. High taxation, frequent droughts and a world economic depression were precipitating factors for a mass exodus of people from the town and district, first to Egypt and then to the United States. In 1922, the episcopal see of Kyrenia returned to the town after the completion of a new metropolitan building. That same year, the Greco-Turkish war brought to a halt all trade with the opposite coast causing a serious economic depression. To the rescue came a young repatriate from the USA who built the town's first modern hotels; first the ‚ÄòSeaview' in 1922 followed by the ‚ÄòDome' in 1932 - both built with a foreign tourist clientele in mind. Kyrenia's mild climate, picturesque harbour, numerous archeological sites, panoramic views that combined sea, mountains and vegetation, coupled with modern amenities, soon attracted many travellers and Kyrenia's economy revived through tourism. After the Second World War, more hotels were built and the town remained a favoured vacation spot for Nicosia residents and foreign travellers alike. To the town's Greek and Turkish inhabitants were added many from Great Britain who chose Kyrenia as their permanent place of residence. After Cypriot Independence In 1960, Cyprus gained its independence from Great Britain. However, the intercommunal conflict that broke out in 1963-64 between the island's Greek and Turkish population again eroded Kyrenia's prosperity. While skirmishes in Kyrenia were minimal, Turkish Cypriot irregulars blockaded the Kyrenia-Nicosia road and occupied Saint Hilarion castle. Despite these difficulties, the 1960s and early 1970s was a period of lively cultural and economic activity. A new town hall was built and a Folklore Museum established. The ancient shipwreck already alluded to was reassembled, together with all its amphorae and cargo, and permanently exhibited at the castle. The number of new hotels and tourists multiplied and a new road was constructed in the early 1970s connecting the town to Nicosia from the east. The town's cultural activities greatly increased. Other than the many traditional cultural and religious fairs and festivals annually celebrated, flower shows, yachting races, concerts and theatre performances were organized. Kyrenia, the smallest of Cypriot towns, was undoubtedly the island's most precious jewel. The town's inhabitants, Greek, Turk, Maronite, Armenian, Latin and British peacefully coexisted and cooperated in their daily affairs and the town had grown beyond its two historic neighbourhoods of Kato (Lower) Kyrenia and Pano (Upper) Kyrenia. It expanded towards the mountain slopes to form the new neighbourhood of \\"California\\", and eastward it had just about reached the outskirts of Thermeia, Karakoumi and Ayios Georgios. On July 20, 1974, Turkey landed on the island to protect the Turkish minority from attack from the Greek military coup for enosis . The Greek Cypriots of Kyrenia abandoned their homes and headed to south of what is now the green line. In 1974, there were 47 villages in the district of Kyrenia . Greek and Maronite Cypriots constituted 83% of the district's total population, while the Turkish Cypriots constituted just 15% of the total. After the Turkish invasion In 1974 the Turkish military conducted the Turkish Invasion of Cyprus. As a result, the Greeks of Kyrenia were expelled from their homes and became refugees. Today, the Republic of Cyprus continues to have a bishop of Kyrenia and the pre-1974 Greek inhabitants of Kyrenia continue to participate elections for the Kyrenia municipality in exile.

Through the influence of Paul Sacher,Paul Sacher Foundation Website Swiss conductor and patron of the arts and sciences, drug company Hoffmann-LaRoche committed unrestricted support of $24 million per year and freedom of design of the institute to its founding director Niels K.

Science 293, 238-239, 2001 Research groups The institute was constructed to consist of about 50 scientists in interactive research groups of 3 to 5 researchers supported by technical staff with no titles other than ‚Äúmember‚Äù with renewable contracts of 2 to 5 years. Interaction was facilitated by laboratories split into two floors per lab connected by a spiral staircase surrounding a central gathering room. Famously, Charley Steinberg mostly presided over casual meetings in the cafeteria. Scientists from beginning postdoctoral to senior professor were provided complete freedom of research design without the pressures of individual fund raising, proposal writing, politicking and pressure to fit research to popular demands and funding source. The institute's administrative structure was minimal. Continuous visits by distinguished visiting scientists from around the world for periods of a day to months enriched the environment.  Culture and Achievements  Establishment of the BII coincided with a convergence of a critical mass of young and energetic scientists from around the world in Basel to staff three startup research ventures to exploit the newly breaking technologies related to molecular biology, gene cloning and development of mouse models. In addition to BII, these were the Friedrich Miescher Institute (FMI)Friedrich Miescher Institute Website sponsored by Ciba-Geigy (now Novartis) and the Biozentrum Biozentrum Website sponsored by the University of Basel. In the 1970s it was estimated that 17 different languages were spoken at the institute united by English, the common language of science. Social gatherings between the international staff of the three institutes and heated discussions concerning lifestyles, the arts and in particular science in the pubs of Basel were common in the period. The BII was known as a training ground for independent thinking and career development rather than a place to be for an entire career. While maintaining a relatively constant core of 50 scientists over its 30-year history, the average age of which was at any one time 35 years, the BII gave rise to over 500 scientists who worked and trained there who with their scientific progeny represent the core of the field of immunology worldwide.[30 Years Basel Institute for Immunology, (History, Milestones, Press Articles, Annual Reports, Publications, List of Institute Members), Souvenir CD/DVD 2001][Publications & Annual Reports 1972-1999] Institute scientists were awarded 27 prestigious international awards in immunology that include three Nobel Prizes, Georges J.F.

It is located in their former residence and printing establishment, the Plantin Press, at the Vrijdagmarkt (Friday Market) in Antwerp, and has been a UNESCO World Heritage Site since 2005.  History  The printing company was founded in the 16th century by Christophe Plantin, who obtained type from the leading typefounders of the day in Paris. Plantin was a major figure in contemporary printing with interests in humanism; his eight-volume, multi-language Plantin Polyglot Bible with Hebrew, Aramaic, Greek and Syriac texts was one of the most complex productions of the period. Plantin's is now suspected of being at least connected to members of heretical groups known as the Familists, and this may have led him to spend time in exile in his native France. View of the courtyard of the museum After Plantin's death it was owned by his son-in-law Jan Moretus. While most printing concerns disposed of their collections of older type in the eighteenth and nineteenth century in response to changing tastes, the Plantin-Moretus company \\"piously preserved the collection of its founder.\\" In 1876 Edward Moretus sold the company to the city of Antwerp. One year later the public could visit the living areas and the printing presses. The collection has been used extensively for research, by historians H. D. L. Vervliet, Mike Parker and Harry Carter. Carter's son Matthew would later describe this research as helping to demonstrate \\"that the finest collection of printing types made in typography's golden age was in perfect condition (some muddle aside) [along with] Plantin's accounts and inventories which names the cutters of his types.\\" In 2002 the museum was nominated as UNESCO World Heritage Site and in 2005 was inscribed onto the World Heritage list. The Plantin-Moretus Museum possesses an exceptional collection of typographical material. Not only does it house the two oldest surviving printing presses in the world and complete sets of dies and matrices, it also has an extensive library, a richly decorated interior and the entire archives of the Plantin business, which were inscribed on UNESCO's Memory of the World Programme Register in 2001 in recognition of their historical significance.

The acoustic punk style of the band and the peculiar vocal style of singer Joe Whiteford gives the band their signature sound. Another signature mark of the band is themes in their lyrics, which often are about B-movies and problems in pop culture and Christianity. The band also incorporates a bit of influence from folk music. The trio of Joseph Whiteford (guitar and vocals), Aaron Richardson (bass) and Christopher Thomas (drums) came together in 1998 and released Sibling Rivalry, a split album with No More Droids, in 1999. In 2000 the band put out Enter the Danger Brigade with Tooth and Nail Records. After the band's initial recording sessions for the album, Tooth & Nail thought that some of the submitted songs were too questionable in content and asked the band to reconvene with producer Barry Poynter and record several more. In all, Calibretto 13 recorded 19 songs for Enter the Danger Brigade, and only 11 songs were included on the debut album. Seven of the remaining songs were released as an EP titled From the Secret Files of the Danger Brigade (2000). In the liner notes for From the Secret Files..., Chris Thomas wrote: \\"[the songs] were kept from being on the album for one reason or another, and because we consider some of these to be our best songs we tried to make sure that you got to hear them. Of course, some of these songs are pretty crappy, too.\\" Calibretto 13 released a second full- length album on Tooth & Nail titled Adventures in Tokyo in 2002. This was the band's final release on Tooth & Nail. After the release of Adventures in Tokyo, the band made several changes. The remaining song from the Enter the Danger Brigade recording sessions, which was not on From the Secret Files of the Danger Brigade, is titled \\"Uncle Sam\\". It was, however, available for download off of the Calibretto website for a short time, along with many other demos, live, and rare tracks. With Joe Whiteford's permission, the rarities have been made available through the link below. Oddly enough, an image of Uncle Sam, which was later used by Calibretto on merchandise, was included in the interior art of From the Secret Files of the Danger Brigade, despite the song not being present. Calibretto The name change from Calibretto 13 to Calibretto marked a significant change in the band. The band left Tooth & Nail and moved to Standard Recording Company. This was after they had begun work on what would have been their third Tooth & Nail Records full length Making the World a Place. In fact, there was a fair amount of merchandise printed bearing this title, although the record was never released. Songs intended for this record would end up on later Calibretto releases. According to posts on their message board, the band did sell CDs titled Making the World a Place in paper bags, although there was never any distribution of the record beyond that. Although retaining a similar sound to Calibretto 13, Calibretto's line-up changed. Aaron Richardson left the band, and began to illustrate comics for Backburner Comics. Richardson's place was filled by Chad A. Serhal, formerly rhythm guitarist of In the face of war. Calibretto released Dead by Dawn EP on Standard Recording Company in 2003. Whereas Calibretto 13 releases were directly aimed towards a Christian audience, the releases under the name Calibretto were not. Under the name Calibretto, the band had two releases, Dead by Dawn EP and a split release with Mercury Radio Theater titled All of These Things Do Not Belong, which was released in 2004. Calibretto played their final show on October 31, 2004 in their hometown, Kokomo, Indiana. In October, 2011, a new track entitled \\"I'm Dressing Up\\" was released on the Hope Can't Walk compilation. The track was recorded at Decapolis Labs, and features Whiteford and Thomas at their usual stations, with Richardson making a return to bass duties, and Serhal taking up a second guitar. It is currently unknown if any further material will surface, or if anything more can be expected from the band in the future.

It was the first private commercial radio station in the country, having based in the capital of Kuala Lumpur. The station was originally the initiative and for some time the flagship station of the conglomerate TIME Engineering Sdn Bhd, and as the name suggests the station was targeted at road and highway users with traffic reports and entertainment. It heralded a new era in the Malaysian broadcasting scene as it was the first station to provide an alternative to government-owned Radio Televisyen Malaysia radio stations and it marked the beginning of a stiff competition for the Malaysian English speaking audience, in turn affecting its own listenership as a whole.  History  THR began its test transmission on the night of 31 August 1994 on FM 99.3 MHz from the Gunung Ulu Kali transmitter site covering the state of Selangor, Kuala Lumpur, and western Pahang. It operated out of a studio rented from Radio Televisyen Malaysia at the Angkasapuri building in Kuala Lumpur. On 9 September, at precisely 3:00 pm local time, symbolically in line with its '99.3' frequency THR officially came into being, operating in both Malay and English for 24 hours a day on the 80:20 formula - 80% broadcast time was in English, 20% in Malay; it was the second station in Malaysia to go round-the- clock after Klasik Nasional FM (then known as Radio 1) in 1971, and did so right out on the first day of its transmission. THR featured some of the best deejays in the local broadcasting industry such as Gina, Andy Hakim, Suzana, Isma Halil Hamzah, Deanna Nassem Rahman, Nasa, Rezz, Albert Ng, Sheela Haran, Kassandra Kassim, Kudsia Kahar and Simon D' Cruz. Most of the personnel would later continue working with other stations, shaping a legacy in Malaysian English radio broadcasting. A year later in 1995, THR expanded its broadcast coverage area to Negeri Sembilan, Melaka and Johor; its broadcast could also be heard in Singapore - at one point THR proved so popular in Singapore, stations there felt threatened by the alarming rate at which listeners changed to the station. Johor Bahru-based Best 104 also began to feel the heat of the competition and decided to 'counterattack' by expanding its broadcast into Kuala Lumpur. between 1995 and 1998 competition for the English speaking audience was stiff between these two stations and Radio Televisyen Malaysia's own counterpart Radio 4. In 1996, THR moved into its own studio on Level 10 of Wisma TIME (building now owned by Johor Corporation as of November 2011) in Jalan Tun Razak, right in the heart of Kuala Lumpur's city centre. The same year saw broadcast coverage extended to the Northern states of Perak, Penang, Kedah and Perlis.  Stiff competition and decline  The extension of Best 104's broadcast into THR's Klang Valley listener hinterland in 1996 presented a challenge of sorts to THR, with at least one deejay 'leaping' from THR to Best 104. However, it was the start of AMP Radio Network's HITZ FM broadcast in January 1997 that really hurt the popularity of THR, as it did Best 104. Introduction of further English stations by AMP Radio Networks eroded the English listenership of both stations (THR and Best 104), upon which advertising revenues of both were largely dependent. AMP's stations provided the Malaysian radio audience with specialised genre playlist - with each station concentrating on one of the following - top hits, adult contemporary, and easy listening. Best 104 and THR themes were based on a combination of these genres, and the introduction of specialised station for each genre swayed listenership of the two stations away. Best 104 gradually decreased the time slot for English broadcast, from 10 hours a day to two, before finally ceasing the broadcasts in 2001. Following the number of Singaporeans who listens English broadcasts everyday, the English broadcasts revived at the end of 2001 with the launch of a separate broadcast between 5:00 PM to 6:00 PM thus making it one hour. THR briefly went from bilingual to trilingual, introducing Chinese time slots. It then dropped both the English and Chinese broadcast slots, retaining Malay slots and introducing Tamil broadcasts. In 2002, THR expanded coverage to Kuantan, Kuala Terengganu and Kota Bharu, and Gegar was launched 24 hours as Malay East Coast radio station to compete against Manis FM.  Current status  The station was eventually acquired by AMP Radio Networks (now Astro Radio) in 2005 and split into 2 different channels; the Tamil language section became THR Raaga and the Malay language section became THR Gegar, which broadcasts primarily on the East Coast region of Peninsular Malaysia.Nielsen Media Radio Audiences Measurement, Survey 2, 2008.Astro buys THR.fm station for RM30mil  References  External links   Category:Radio stations in Malaysia Category:Malay-language radio stations Category:Tamil-language radio stations Category:Mass media in Kuala Lumpur Category:Radio stations established in 1995 ","title":"THR.fm"},{"id":"3547560","text":"Cynna Kydd (n√©e Neele; born 18 September 1981 in Kyabram, Victoria) is a former Australian professional netball player. Kydd achieved some success in netball and swimming in her early life, and played in the Dairy Farmers State League at the age of 16. She was also selected for the national under-21 team in 1999 and was accepted by the Australian Institute of Sport, before launching her professional career. Kydd was a goal shooter for the Melbourne Kestrels in the Commonwealth Bank Trophy from 2000 to 2006, serving as club captain for the last two years. An accurate and high-scoring shooter, she was one of the league's top players of that era, winning the competition's Most Valuable Player award for 2004. She was also a frequent member of the Australian national netball team from 2003 to 2005. Her career was hampered by injury and poor form in later years, and she struggled after being dropped from the national side in early 2005 and missing out on a return in time for the 2006 Commonwealth Games after sustaining a serious concussion late in the year. Kydd made the surprise decision at the beginning of the 2006 season to transfer from the Kestrels, where she had been captain, to the club's more successful rival, the Melbourne Phoenix, but she lasted only one season before walking away from the club to travel overseas. She subsequently signed with New Zealand club Canterbury Flames for the 2007 National Bank Cup season, but withdrew her services before playing a game due to injury. She subsequently moved to England, where she played mixed minor grade netball. Early life Kydd was born in the Victorian regional town of Kyabram, and began playing competitive netball at age nine. Though also a talented swimmer, she was forced to make a choice between the two sports, and ultimately chose netball. She played for local and Goulburn Valley representative teams as a teenager and, in 1998 at the age of 16, was selected to play for the dominant Eastside Netball Club in the state Dairy Farmers State League competition, alongside three national league players. Despite a regular three-hour commute and having to juggle sporting commitments with studies at Kyabram Secondary College, she played an integral role in Eastside's premiership that year. She was subsequently named in the state under-21 squad for the annual Australian National Netball Championships and in the Melbourne Kestrels squad for the 1999 season. Despite never having played a national league game, Kydd was selected in the national under-21 (U-21) team in 1999, which, as a result of reforms made that year, automatically saw her admitted to the Australian Institute of Sport (AIS). She spent the 1999 season playing for the AIS team in the Victorian state league, before switching to their South Australian counterparts for the 2000 season. Kydd, at 188 cm (6 ft 2 in) tall, established a reputation as an effective shooter, and despite often missing matches as a result of her national U-21 team was a key part of the team. Commonwealth Bank Trophy debut Kydd made her debut for the Melbourne Kestrels in April 2000 but, because of her relative inexperience, was asked to play only two games for them over the season. She earned selection in the U-21 national squad to tour Jamaica in May, followed by a successful stint with the team as part of the squad for the Youth World Cup in Wales. At season's end Kydd was named in the state open team for the national championships and, while remaining in the U-21 squad, was also named in the initial national open squad, despite having only played two national league games. However, the national squad was at the time enjoying an unusual glut of shooters, and she was cut amidst fierce competition from six other prominent players, all aiming at just three positions in the final team. Her disappointment was, however, partly offset when she won the Commonwealth Bank Trophy's Best New Talent award, worth A$5,000, in February 2001. Kydd graduated from high school at the end of 2000, and moved to Kensington, an inner suburb of Melbourne, in February 2001 to study tourism and hospitality at Victoria University. At the beginning of the 2001 season, two of the Kestrels' main stars, Shelley O'Donnell and Janine Ilitch, both announced that they would be sidelined for most or all of the season because of pregnancy, and Kydd was called upon to fill the vacancy. She became a core player instantly, and although the Kestrels struggled, Kydd formed an effective combination with goal shooter Amanda Burton (who she had previously played with in the interstate competition). Kydd was among the team's standout performers and was frequently praised in the media for both her accuracy and consistency, coming away at season's end with 390 goals and the fifth highest scoring average in the competition. She continued to represent Australia in under-21 competition, being selected for several home matches against England and a tour of New Zealand, and was again selected in the national open squad in the lead-up to the 2002 Commonwealth Games, but was once again cut from the final team. Furthering her career Though she had missed out on Commonwealth Games selection, Kydd had established a reputation as a particularly difficult opponent by the beginning of the 2002 Commonwealth Bank Trophy season. She was consistently among the league's top goalers, particularly after she was again paired with Burton, due to the axing of struggling new recruit Kristy Doyle. She scored her 500th goal with the Kestrels in the middle of the season, and excelled against some particularly difficult opponents, including then- Australian captain Kathryn Harby-Williams. She was integral in helping the Kestrels make the semifinals for the first time since 1999, and was the third- highest scorer in the league. Kydd was again named in the extended national squad at the end of the season, and finally survived the cut, being named in the squad to tour Jamaica in early 2003, beating rival shooters Jane Altschwager and Megan Dehn (n√©e Anderson) for the vacancy caused by the retirement of veteran player Jacqui Delaney. International selection At only 21 Kydd was the youngest player on the tour of Jamaica and, while she toured with the remainder of the team, was overlooked for a Test position. She finally made her full d√©but against South Africa not long afterwards, and managed to cement her position with a superb performance, managing an accuracy rate of 94% in the third Test. This performance, along with similar form in the national league, led to her selection in the starting squad for the 2003 Netball World Championships. She played every game in the world championships in July at the expense of ageing veteran Eloise Southby, a decision which was the cause of some controversy. She subsequently helped the Kestrels to the elimination final and, at the end of the season, was named as the team's new vice-captain, with predecessor Janine Ilitch assuming the captaincy. She also won the coveted Commonwealth Bank Trophy Player's Player Award, and tied for third in the Most Valuable Player count. Career peak With the experience gained from several seasons in the national league, Kydd reached her peak in 2004. She was rarely troubled in the national league all year, scoring 436 goals at an average accuracy of 79%; statistics among the best in the league. Although Burton had retired, creating a supporting void that the Kestrels struggled to fill, she again played a vital role in the team reaching the finals series. She also established her place as a regular member of the national team, playing in Test series against South Africa and New Zealand and a practice match against England. Though she struggled initially against the Silver Ferns, Kydd improved over the space of the series and was awarded player of the match in the third Test. At the end of the tour, she was given some praise for being among Australia's best in what had been an otherwise disastrous series. She was rewarded for her form when she was a surprise choice for the 2004 Commonwealth Bank Trophy Most Valuable Player Award, being selected over favourite veteran internationals Catherine Cox and Sharelle McMahon. When captain Ilitch was ruled out for 2005 because of pregnancy, Kydd was the natural choice to replace her, and she was soon announced as the Kestrels' new leader. Form slump and injuries Kydd graduated from university at the end of 2004, but had significant difficulty finding employment as her netball commitments scared off prospective employers. She also became engaged to Garth Kydd, a member of the Australian men's netball team, whom she married in April 2006. Kydd was widely expected to again feature among the league's best, however, she was disappointing against South Africa in February. She also struggled in the opening games of the national league season, a result largely attributed to nerves associated with the captaincy. She began to recover her form, but in May broke her finger. She continued to play but the injury severely inhibited her performance for four weeks. In June she was dropped from the national team for the first time in two years as a result of poor form and injury, with national coach Norma Plummer stating that she was \\"very disappointed that [Kydd had] let it drop\\" and that she \\"never thought she would have to [cut her from the team]\\". The ageing Southby-Halbish was brought in to replace her and Kydd admitted that her accuracy had been well below ideal levels. She improved markedly over the following two rounds, but on 23 July suffered major concussion after being hit hard in the head during a match against the Adelaide Thunderbirds, which required her to be taken to hospital. A brilliant performance against the Perth Orioles the following week seemed to suggest a quick recovery, however she was dogged with complications for the remainder of the season. In an attempt to regain her position in the national squad, Kydd attended the extended squad's first training camp in September 2005, but was one of several players forced out after succumbing to a virus. She was subsequently left out of the team for a practice tour of Jamaica and New Zealand in the lead-up to the 2006 Commonwealth Games, but continued her efforts to make the team for the Games. Finally, on 10 December 2005, she voluntarily withdrew her name from selection, noting ongoing complications from the earlier concussion (team doctors stated that she had probably attempted to return too quickly) and low motivation. Defection to the Melbourne Phoenix After withdrawing from the Commonwealth Games squad, Kydd took a four-month hiatus from the sport in order to recover from injury and regain motivation. She married fianc√©e Garth in April 2006, and though widely known by her maiden name, decided to take on her husband's surname. Kydd began the process of re-signing with the Kestrels for the 2006 season, and returned to training with the club with March 2006, but stunned the team when she defected to more successful rival Melbourne Phoenix only three weeks before the start of the season. The defection caused notable antagonism between the traditional rivals with Kydd's former coach, Jane Searle and several teammates expressing shock at the suddenness of the switch. After six years at the Kestrels, the defection saw Kydd forced to adapt to a new shooting combination with veteran international Sharelle McMahon. As she had had little opportunity to train with the new team before the opening of the season, the pair initially had some difficulty adjusting to each other's style. After a tenuous start, however, the pair found form, and were able to form a relatively successful combination. Kydd scored 360 goals in the season, and assisted the Phoenix in becoming the top scoring side for the season, although occasionally patchy form from the team as a whole saw the Phoenix slip outside the top two at season's end. Kydd was overlooked for a return to international selection during the 2006‚Äì07 season. In October 2006, Kydd announced that she was leaving the Phoenix after just one season, a move that stunned coach Julie Hoornweg. Kydd said that she was travelling overseas with her husband, leading to speculation she would play in New Zealand. Hoornweg said that if she had known that Kydd would not keep her long-term commitment, then she would have rather invested in young talent, referring to Kydd as a \\"player at risk\\". In November, New Zealand's Canterbury Flames announced Kydd in their squad for the 2007 National Bank Cup. Her contract was to start in February 2007, so that she could fulfil work commitments with Youth Hostels Association, Victoria. However, Kydd withdrew her services to the Flames without playing a match, citing medical advice, due to a concussion incident. In late 2007, Kydd was playing mixed netball in the United Kingdom in the PIM Mixed A competition.

Publication history Created by John Byrne, Doorman first appeared in the pages of the West Coast Avengers in 1989. Fictional character biography Little is known of Doorman's life before he responded to Mr. Immortal's advertisement for a hero team. This team would eventually become the Great Lakes Avengers. It has been revealed, however, that he is a mutant and has an African-American complexion.GLA: Misassembled #4 Before joining the Great Lakes Avengers, DeMarr Davis was an average American youngster. Sometime during his years in college, DeMarr's mother died. After completing four years of college and three years of graduate school, DeMarr decided to answer Mr. Immortal's newspaper ad asking \\"costumed adventurers\\" to join together and form a team. DeMarr, being a mutant and possessing his unique teleporting ability, is able to allow his teammates entrance into almost any structure, thus creating both a stealthy entrance as well as a surprise attack. He joined the original incarnation of the Great Lakes Avengers.Seen in flashback in GLA: Misassembled #1‚Äì4 (2005) He was first seen in public with the team by Hawkeye and Mockingbird, who later agreed to become their mentors.West Coast Avengers #46 With the team, he helped Hawkeye and the West Coast Avengers against \\"That Which Endures\\".West Coast Avengers #48-49 They also assisted Mockingbird in a holding action against Terminus.Avengers Annual #19 After aiding the Thunderbolts against the villain Graviton,Thunderbolts #15‚Äì17 (June‚ÄìAugust 1998) and #25 (Apr. 1999) the team clashed with the mercenary Deadpool.Deadpool #10‚Äì11 (November‚ÄìDecember 1997) and #61 (2002) Doorman is, however, the most cynical of the Great Lakes Avengers, constantly comparing the team to the real Avengers, usually at the most inappropriate times, and feeling at times embarrassed by his friends. Nonetheless, DeMarr cares for them deeply, and values each and every member of the team. GLA: Misassembled During the G.L.A. mini-series, the team took on Maelstrom who was trying to destroy the universe. After Dinah Soar's death,GLA: Misassembled #1 Mr. Immortal suffers a nervous break down leading Flatman and Doorman to search for new members. They went to New York City, where they failed to recruit a number of heroes. While in Central Park, they're saved by Squirrel Girl and her sidekick Monkey Joe from muggers. They offer to recruit her in the team and she accepts. Later, they hear an alarm on a nearby factory and encounter the Grasshopper, who was battling Batroc the Leaper and his minions. During the battle, Flatman offers to recruit him and Grasshopper quickly accepts, only to be instantly killed by Zaran, one of Batroc's minions, who threw a sai that passed through Doorman and landed on his head.GLA: Misassembled #2 DeMarr feels that it is his fault that Grasshopper died and therefore sunk into a slight depression. During this time, he also tried to scare Squirrel Girl off the team, because he feared that she would also die while in service to the GLA, but he later apologizes to her.GLA: Misassembled #3 During the final battle, Doorman gets killed, sacrificing himself so that Mr. Immortal could stop Maelstrom. In the afterlife, he met the other deceased GLA members including Grasshopper who forgave him. Doorman was, however, intrigued by the absence of Hawkeye, until Mockingbird tells him that he became the new Swordsman. Shortly afterwards, the cosmic entity Oblivion summoned him declaring that he could prove useful to him because of his connection to the Darkforce Dimension, akin to Deathurge, who had been recently captured by Mr. Immortal. Doorman therefore replaced Deathurge and became Oblivion's new angel of death. Taking Deathurge's place, Doorman took Maelstrom to the afterlife, after he was tricked into killing himself by Mr. Immortal, and was able to return to the GLA. As a servant of Oblivion, he is able to summon skis to fly and is intangible. Doorman continues to be a member of the GLA. However, after he helped his friends save the universe from Maelstrom, he understands the team's importance and has a newfound respect for them. After receiving a subpoena from the real Avengers and discovering that they were all mutants, the team decided to change their name to the Great Lakes X-Men, complete with new costumes. GLX-Mas Special During the GLX-Mas Special, the team confronted Dr. Tannenbaum, who had released an army of living Christmas trees on the citizens of Wisconsin. Later, Doorman informed the team that he had to go and visit his father. Upon reaching his father's house, his father quickly complained that DeMarr was throwing his life away and needed to join the real world. He told his son that he had \\"stupid powers\\" and \\"all the other heroes have better powers than you\\". Realizing that his own happiness was more important than his father's respect, DeMarr finally admitted the truth to his father: that he had died and came back as an angel of death. He had not come back to visit his father but rather to collect his soul, as he had fallen off the roof while setting up Christmas lights and died. The revelation of DeMarr's new role in the universe greatly pleased his father, who couldn't wait to brag to all his friends in heaven about how his son was the new angel of death.GLX-Mas Special #1 Great Lakes Champions The team participated in a charity superhero poker tournament hosted by the Thing, where Flatman beat their host in the final round. Flatman's status as champion inspired the team to rename themselves the Great Lakes Champions, after being discouraged from affiliation with both the X-Men and the Defenders by members of those teams present at the tournament, ignoring the protests of former Champions of Los Angeles member Hercules.The Thing vol. 2 #8 (2006) Civil War/The Initiative All of the Great Lakes Champions have registered with the United States government as required by the Superhuman Registration Act, as revealed when Deadpool mistakenly attempted to apprehend them for violating the Act, only to be defeated and informed that they had already registered.Cable & Deadpool #30 DeMarr has been identified as one of the 142 registered superheroes who appear on the cover of the comic book Avengers: The Initiative #1.Avengers: The Initiative #1 Character Map Doorman and his teammates became the Initiative group in charge of Wisconsin, calling themselves the Great Lakes Initiative. They were given a rescue mission to save Dionysus after he fell from Mount Olympus and was captured by A.I.M., who planned to use his powers to cause mental instability on all the superheroes they consider a threat. During the task, Deadpool ambushes Mr. Immortal and Flatman. Flatman recruited him as a reserve member of the team but the mercenary eventually overstayed his welcome. After many failed attempts, Deadpool is kicked out of the group by Squirrel Girl.Deadpool/GLI Summer Fun Spectacular #1 Secret Invasion During the Secret Invasion storyline, the team confronted a Skrull disguised as Grasshopper, with help from Gravity and Catwalk.Avengers: The Initiative #19 (Dec. 2008) They later appeared to welcome Gravity as leader of the team, after he was transferred to Wisconsin by Norman Osborn.Avengers: The Initiative #25 Fear Itself During the Fear Itself storyline, the team confronts Asbestos Man, who takes advantage of the fear and chaos that is happening. None of the group actually wish to touch the man due to the toxicity of his suit. Mr. Immortal talks him into giving up in return for being remembered by the others.Fear Itself: The Home Front #6 Great Lakes Avengers (2016 series) In the ongoing series The Great Lakes Avengers, it is revealed that the team had disbanded and gone their separate ways. During that time, Doorman continued on his role as an angel of death. He then meets Flatman and Big Bertha at a local diner, after being informed that the GLA has been reinstated as a permanent addition to the Avengers. They relocate to Detroit, Michigan where they meet a girl named Pansy at their new headquarters, a factory owned by Tony Stark.The Great Lakes Avengers #1 (2016) The team then goes to a local bar to try and convince the owner to turn down the music. The owner, Nain Rogue, instead refuses and begins to insult them, particularly Mr. Immortal and Big Bertha. Upon being arrested after getting into a fight, Doorman escapes and finds Mr. Immortal inside a coffin. He then brings him back to the surface, convincing him to help the others. After Connie Ferrari gets the other Great Lakes Avengers out of the police station, Doorman was present when Goodness Silva was added to the Great Lakes Avengers where she takes on the name of Good Boy.The Great Lakes Avengers #2 (2016) After the team discovers that Dick Snerd shut them down, Mr. Immortal returns and takes Flatman on patrol, while Bertha, Doorman and Good Boy go to Nain Rogue's bar to find clues. Upon entering the bar, Doorman is pulled into the Darkforce Dimension, where Oblivion angrily demands an explanation for his absence.The Great Lakes Avengers #3 (2016) Doorman then goes back to work when he gets a text from Bertha, who was injured while fighting Dr. Nob and his squad.The Great Lakes Avengers #6 (2016) During the battle, Dr. Nod takes more of the weight-loss supplements, becoming much bigger and monstrous. On Mr. Immortal's suggestion, the team performs a maneuver that has Doorman and Mr. Immortal get inside Dr. Nod's body, where Mr. Immortal manages to kill him by punching his heart. After their victory, the team is visited by Deadpool who tells them that they've been fired and can no longer use the Avengers name, leaving them confused.The Great Lakes Avengers #7 (2016) Powers and abilities Doorman is capable of teleporting people through solid walls, with his own body serving as a portal of sorts. His mutant ability operates by tapping into the Darkforce Dimension. He also had the ability to levitate. Originally, his all-black appearance was a costume of apparently conventional material with stark white eyepieces in the mask as contrast. However, since becoming Oblivion's servant his \\"body\\" seems to be an assumed shape rather than a simple costume, and he can transform at will from this form to his non- costumed self. After Deathurge was vanquished, Doorman also gained intangibility, flight via skis that he can summon at will and the ability to collect the souls of the recently deceased and deliver them to Oblivion. While doing so, he appears visible only to the soul he is collecting and possibly also his teammate Mr. Immortal, who could perceive Deathurge. Appearance After dying and being resurrected by Oblivion to become its new \\"angel of death\\", Doorman's appearance has changed as he now possesses white gloves, boots and a cape, and skis: the trademarks of his predecessor Deathurge. In fact, his only difference in appearance from Deathurge are the white \\"eyes\\" that were once the eyepieces of his original costume.

He was born in 1903 in Nanos ‚Äì then in Austria-Hungary, now in Slovenia ‚Äì and died in 1978 in Ljubljana. After attending primary school he continued his schooling in Ljubljana and became a carpentry foreman and, later, a mechanic. By the start of the Second World War he had founded his own workshop in Ljubljana, where he employed a few people until he became seriously ill in 1968. In the former Yugoslavia and throughout Europe he was famous for a large number of patented inventions. Most of these he went on to manufacture and market himself, but where the market demanded greater quantities he sold or licensed the inventions (in the former communist Yugoslavia, legislation forbade the employment of more than seven people and production was limited to a small surface area.) Altogether he patented 15 inventions in Yugoslavia and of these some also in Italy, Argentina and Germany. All these inventions were realised in practice and in their time were great hits. His watertight windows and framed balcony doors were installed throughout Yugoslavia in representative buildings and schools, and also in the Karadjordjevo palace of Marshal Tito in Serbia. His invention of electrical switches for electrical hot plates was a hit immediately, and after the Second World War demand was so great he was forced to sell the license. The invention of accessories for vertically and horizontally opening windows was mass-produced at large companies due to the huge demand for them. He also developed a special technological process for making high quality keys, which he kept to himself and used in his own workshop throughout his life. The greatest international success he enjoyed was in 1934 in London, where at an international crafts fair his wedged window won a diploma, a gold medal and a silver cup. In the former Yugoslavia he also won various awards and recognitions. He also won a prize in Czechoslovakia for solving a mathematical problem.

It offers the dual academic pathway of NCEA and International Baccalaureate. History The school was established in 1910 on the initiative of Bishop Julius of the Anglican Diocese of Christchurch, who invited the Kilburn, England-based Sisters of the Church Order to set up the school. The school was initially located in the Christchurch Central City south of Armagh Street, where it opened on 8 February 1910. In 1914, the school moved slightly north to Chester Street West off Cranmer Square, and that building is now part of the Cathedral Grammar School. St Margaret's opened a prep school on Papanui Road in the early 1920s, just north of the current school grounds. In the 1940s, the current grounds were occupied. On that site, the school had been using an 1880 homestead as a boarding house since 1922. In 1941, this building was renamed Kilburn House. In the 2011 Christchurch earthquake, Kilburn House was damaged. After NZ$2 million repairs, Kilburn House opened again in August 2012. The school received a commendation from the Christchurch Civic Trust for the renovation of this heritage building. This renovation was part of a significant rebuild project following the earthquakes when the school lost close to 90% of its buildings. St Margaret's College today St Margaret's College is the only girls' school in the South Island of New Zealand to offer the International Baccalaureate Diploma in addition to NCEA. It is divided into three schools: * Junior School (Years 1‚Äì6) * Middle School (Years 7‚Äì10) * Senior School (Years 11‚Äì13) Boarding (Years 7‚Äì13) St Margaret's College has over 90 years of boarding history.

It was founded in 1957 in Youngstown, Ohio, and existed until 1999 when it was acquired by Ames. Most stores were located in Ohio, Indiana, New York, Pennsylvania and West Virginia, though the company did make a push into other markets. It pushed further south and had several stores in Virginia, Tennessee, Kentucky, and Alabama and west into Michigan. History=Beginning In the late 1950s, Hills stores were full-fledged department stores (as opposed to the discount department stores for which the chain later became known). Herbert H. Goldberger, the founder of Hills, sold the chain to SCOA Industries, (Shoe Company of America), of Columbus, Ohio, in 1964. He remained as president of Hills until 1981, when his son succeeded him. Goldberger was the vice president and director of SCOA when, in 1985, he led a management buyout of Hills. Hills went public in 1987, becoming the nation's eighth-largest discount retailer. In November 1990, Goldberger's son resigned, according to a Hills statement, and was replaced by Jack Brouillard. Goldberger's resignation from his family business surprised some observers. He had been the chain's president and CEO since 1981, and assumed the role of board chairman when his father died in 1987. Stephen Goldberger also introduced several other changes, including acceptance of credit cards and rollout of UPC scanning. In 1989, Hills bought 35 of the Worthington, Ohio,-based Gold Circle locations. In the New York and Ohio area, many of these locations had previously been Twin Fair, Inc., stores prior to 1982. Hills had its own private label under which various goods were marketed. It was called \\"American Spirit\\". Bankruptcy and recovery Hills Department Store Sign outside former Hermitage, Tennessee location. Hills filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in February 1991, and the number of stores declined, from 214 to 151. Hills' financial woes dated back to its 1985 leveraged buyout from the Shoe Corporation of America which saddled it with debt. The leveraged buyout was valued at $640 million. Debt mounted again in 1987 when Hills went public. The situation was further aggravated in 1989 when Hills acquired 33 former Gold Circle stores. A difficult economy followed by a recession in 1990‚Äì1991 dealt the chain a crushing blow. Michael Bozic was brought in as President and CEO of Hills to revive the company. He had spent 27 years with Sears and had been the head of the Sears Merchandising Group. Stores were remodeled, scheduled opening of distribution centers beginning in 1991, and the introduction of a new store prototype in 1991. Hills had a large toy section that accounted for more than 10% of sales throughout the year. Hills achieved a notable recovery from bankruptcy in 1993 as Hills Stores Company. Takeover and acquisition by Ames Former Hills location (left) at Northern Lights Shopping Center in Economy, Pennsylvania in 2014. Like many former Hills locations, it has been vacant since Ames' liquidation in 2002. CEO Michael Bozic resigned, along with most of the senior executives, July 5, 1995, ending a tumultuous two-year siege for control of the regional discounter by Dickstein Partners, Hills' largest stockholder. Bozic was replaced by Jack Smailes, formerly the company's executive VP, GMM. Dickstein resigned his post February 8, 1996, replaced as chairman by Chaim Edelstein, a former chairman of A&S; Department Stores. Dickstein's resignation as chairman was joined by that of Jack Smailes, president and CEO, who was replaced by Gregory Raven, who formerly served as chief financial officer of Revco. The 164-unit discounter then announced it would seek to acquire other regional discounters in the quest to become a larger, stronger operator. It was a difficult two years for Greg Raven and Hills. Completely new systems were instituted. \\"We're taking every system we have and throwing them away,\\" Raven said. The new focus would be on merchandising systems, new financial systems, human resources, payroll, payables and eventually a new warehouse management system. A reset of the hardlines section was completed, which included lopping off 4 ft. from the end of the gondola runs to create a power aisle with pallet presentations of \\"good values.\\" Logo variant. In December 1998, Ames acquired Hills. At that time Hills was operating 155 stores, covering 12 states, and employing in excess of 20,000 employees. Headquarters were in Canton, Massachusetts.Hills Company History With the Hills acquisition, Ames expanded from 301 to 456 stores and became the nation's fourth-largest discount chain behind Walmart, Kmart, and Target. Almost all Hills stores were renamed Ames by the end of 1999, even in markets where Ames and Hills overlapped (with the exception of the one remaining Hills Department Store located in Christiansburg, Virginia). Most of the overlap was in the Pittsburgh region, where Ames had acquired the G. C. Murphy chain based in the Pittsburgh suburb of McKeesport in 1985 and was an adjacent market to Hills' original market of Youngstown. Ames, however, would experience its own financial difficulties due to the Hills purchase, and would be out of business entirely by the end of 2002. Legacy While some former Hills locations would eventually become occupied by other businesses such as Target, Big Lots, and Planet Fitness, many of them remain empty since the Ames liquidation. The July 14, 2015 episode of Pittsburgh Dad, which had a Back to the Future theme, shows the titular character going back to November 5, 1989, just to shop at Hills and stop to get food at their food court.Dad Goes Back to the Future Pittsburgh Dad (07/14/2015) Based on the episode as well as several episodes of Dad wearing Hills-themed attire, a Pittsburgh-based candle company released a \\"Pittsburgh Dad's Hills Snack Bar\\" scented candle that is supposed to replicate the smell of the popular snack bar from Hills.

It attracts around 30,000 tourists a year  Etymology and names  The Malagasy name Antsirabe literally means \\"the place of much salt\\". The city has the nicknames ville d'eau ('city of water' in French) and visy gasy or le Vichy malgache ('the Malagasy Visy' in Malagasy and French respectively), referring to the presence of multiple thermal springs in the area.  History  The area where Antsirabe is found today was part of the Kingdom of Andrantsay which existed from the early 1600s until it was incorporated into the Imerina kingdom in the early 1800s. The area was a farming region, with production of rice, vegetables and fruit. The first Norwegian (Lutheran) missionaries arrived in 1868. Limestone and sulphur were exploited in the area at this time. The city was founded by Norwegian missionary T.G. Rosaas in 1872 as a hill station to serve as a retreat centre because of the much cooler climate. The thermal baths were opened in 1917. In 1886 the Norwegian mission established the leper hospital of Ambohipiantrana and it quickly developed into a village for lepers. The colonial government decided to make it the leper hospital of Vakinankaratra and the around 950 people with the illness lived there in 1904. During the French colonial rule the centre of the Vakinankaratra region shifted from the Andrantsay capital of Fivavahana to Antsirabe. In 1921 it succeeded Betaf√≥ as the seat of a Catholic (pre-diocesan) Apostolic vicariate, and was promoted to a bishopric in 1955.  Population = Demographics  The population of Antsirabe was estimated at 238,478 in 2013.  Languages  The majority of the population belongs to the Merina ethnic group, which speaks a highland dialect of Malagasy. As in other urban areas of Madagascar, French is widely understood.  Places of worship  The Antsirabe Cathedral The places of worship, are predominantly Christian churches and temples; Church of Jesus Christ in Madagascar (World Communion of Reformed Churches), Malagasy Lutheran Church (Lutheran World Federation), Assemblies of God, Association of Bible Baptist Churches in Madagascar (Baptist World Alliance), Roman Catholic Diocese of Antsirabe (Catholic Church seated in the Cathedral of Our Lady of La Salette).J.

Antsirabe is also the capital of the Vakinankaratra region. Since April 2012, the city is governed by a \\"Special Delegation\\" with three members: Razafindrainiony Lala Marie B√©ryl, the previous Head of Antsirabe I District is President of the Special Delegation while Randrianarison Olivier from the TIM party and Rakotomalala Olivier from the AS party are First and Second Deputy presidents, respectively. Between November 2011 and April 2012 the position of the Mayor of Antsirabe was vacant. Olga Ramalason of the TIM party was Mayor until she was appointed Minister of Commerce in Omer Beriziky's government of consensus in November 2011. The city council was elected in November 2003.  Architecture  H√¥tel des Thermes Several buildings in central Antsirabe date back to the first decades of the 20th century. These include the thermal bath centre (opened in 1917), H√¥tel des Thermes (1922), the railway station (1923), and the residence for French retirees (1934). Other sights are la St√®le de l'Ind√©pendance (the Stele of Independence) on Independence Avenue and the two public markets: Antsenakely (\\"The Small Market\\") and the bigger Asabotsy.

The Mania River is south of Antsirabe.  Economy  An Export Processing Zone is located in Antsirabe and the town is the home of several factories, including Star Brasseries (beverages), Cotona (textiles) and Kobama (grain). As in Antananarivo, international economic sanctions following the 2009 uprising and following political crisis led to an economic downturn and factory lay-offs in Antsirabe. The removal of Madagascar from the list of beneficiaries of the African Growth and Opportunity Act was particularly important in this regard.  Infrastructure  Train station The city is at the end of the TA (Tananarive-Antsirabe) railway line, part of the Network North railway, which links Antsirabe to the capital and the port city of Toamasina. The line is operated by Madarail, currently only with freight trains. The line has been extended southwards through Vinaninkarena, but this extension is not in use.

Alongside Rajkumar and Vishnuvardhan, he is counted in Kannada cinema's \\"triumvirate\\" as its most celebrated actors. With his debut in Puttanna Kanagal's National Award winning Kannada film Naagarahaavu (1972), Ambareesh's acting career commenced with a brief phase of portraying antagonistic and supporting characters. After establishing himself as a lead actor portraying rebellious characters on screen in a number of commercially successful films, he earned the moniker \\"rebel star\\". He also earned the nickname Mandyada Gandu (English: Man of Mandya) and continues to hold a matinee idol status in the popular culture of Karnataka. After joining politics in 1994, Ambareesh became a three-time member of the Lok Sabha, the lower house of the Indian Parliament representing Mandya, first from Janata Dal and the latter two times from the Indian National Congress, a member of which he remained till his death. During the third term, he briefly served as the Minister of State for Information and Broadcasting, between October 2006 and February 2007, as part of the First Manmohan Singh ministry. Between 2013 and 2016, he was a member of the Karnataka Legislative Assembly and served as the Minister of Housing during the time as part of the Siddaramaiah cabinet. Besides winning many State Film awards and Filmfare Awards South during his acting career, Ambareesh was honoured with the honorary doctorate by the Karnatak University in 2013. He is also a recipient NTR National Award, Filmfare Lifetime Achievement Award ‚Äì South and Dr. Vishnuvardhan Award, all awarded recognizing lifetime achievements and contribution to cinema. Having suffered from a breathing problem starting 2014, Ambareesh died four years later. Early life Ambareesh was born on 29 May 1952 in Doddarasinakere village of Mandya district in the erstwhile Mysore State (now Karnataka). He was named as Malavalli Huchche Gowda Amarnath, and was the sixth of seven children to Huche Gowda and Padmamma. His granduncle was the violinist, Chowdiah. Ambareesh completed his schooling in Mandya before moving to Saraswathipuram in Mysore for higher studies. Career= As actor  While the eminent Kannada film director Puttanna Kanagal was in search of a new face to play a brief antagonist role for his upcoming film, one of Ambareesh's close friend, Sangram Singh, suggested his name for the screen test much against his wishes. At his screen test, he was asked to walk in a certain fashion, utter a dialogue and toss a cigarette in his mouth. Impressed, Kanagal cast him in his 1972 film Naagarahaavu. The film also saw the debut of Vishnuvardhan, another actor who would go on to become one of Kannada cinema's most popular actors. Ambareesh appeared in about 208 films, including other films of Kanagal such as Paduvaaralli Pandavaru, Shubhamangala, Masanada Hoovu and Ranganayaki (1981). , Ambareesh had acted in the most films as lead in Kannada films, surpassing Rajkumar's record of 206 films as lead actor and Vishnuvardhan's record of 230 films (including Kannada, Hindi, Telugu, Tamil and Malayalam films) as a lead actor. The record has not been broken yet. He also was a supporting actor many times at the beginning of their career. Ambareesh played the angry young man of the 1980s, and several films were tailor-made accordingly. The earliest of them was the political satire Antha (1981), directed by Rajendra Singh Babu and remade into Hindi and Tamil. This controversial film was the first in India to depict politicians and government officials as corrupt and villainous. Chakravyuha and New Delhi were made on the same lines, the first remade into Hindi as Inquilaab, starring Amitabh Bachchan and the second a remake of the Malayalam hit of the same name. His other notable films include Ranganayaki, Tony, Rani Maharani, Olavina Udugore, Hrudaya Haadithu, Hongkongnalli Agent Amar, Mannina Doni and Odahuttidavaru. His performance in Masanada Hoovu, Elu Suttina Kote and Sreekumaran Thampi's Malayalam film Gaanam (1982) received critical acclaim. Thampi cast Ambareesh after being impressed with his performance in Ranganayaki. Despite turning out to be a commercial failure, the film went on to win the Kerala State Film Award for Best Film with Popular Appeal and Aesthetic Value. Ambareesh also showed the great performance in Mamateya Madilu, Hrudaya Haadithu, Elu Sutinaa Kote and Mouna Raga. He also acted with legend Rajkumar. He is well known as Mandyada Gandu, Kaliyuga Karna (for his generosity), and Rebel Star. He was awarded the State award best actor for antha and best supporting role for masanada hoovu, NTR Award by Andhra Pradesh Government, Film Fare best actor award for Olavina Udugore and Film Fare Award (lifetime achievement award). He was the first Kannada actor to inaugurate the world-famous Mysore Dasara festival organized by the government of Karnataka. He also won the Karnataka Government's Dr. Vishnuvardhan Award in 2011.  As politician  Ambareesh joined the Indian National Congress (INC) ahead of the assembly election in 1994. He campaigned for the party in the election after having been \\"too late to be given a ticket\\". However, he was met with lukewarm reception from the public having been \\"greeted with slippers and rotten vegetables at a couple of public meetings.\\" He quit the party two years later after being denied a ticket to contest the 1996 general election. Ambareesh subsequently joined the Janata Dal and contested the 1998 general election from Mandya. He won the seat upon polling 431,439 votes against 250,916 for the INC candidate. In 1999, Ambareesh rejoined the INC and contested in five elections since. He served as minister of state for Information and Broadcasting in the 14th Lok Sabha, but resigned over his dissatisfaction with the Cauvery Dispute Tribunal award, though the resignation was not formally accepted. He was defeated in the May 2009 General Elections. He helped in elections for H.D. Kumaraswamy (in Kanakapura parliament election in the 1990s), S.M. Krishna (1999) and K.R. Pete Krishna.

The Sony DSC-R1 Bridge cameras are cameras that fill the niche between the single-lens reflex cameras (SLRs) and the point-and-shoot camera which are prominent in the prosumer market segment. They are often comparable in size and weight to the smallest digital SLRs (DSLR), but lack interchangeable lenses, and almost all digital bridge cameras lack an optical viewfinder system. The phrase \\"bridge camera\\" has been in use at least since the 1980s, and continues to be used with digital cameras. The term was originally used to refer to film cameras which \\"bridged the gap\\" between point-and-shoot cameras and SLRs. Like other cameras, most current bridge cameras are digital. These cameras typically feature full manual controls over shutter speed, aperture, ISO sensitivity, color balance and metering. Generally, their feature sets are similar to consumer DSLRs, except for a smaller range of ISO sensitivity because of their typically smaller image sensor (a DSLR has a 35mm, APS, or Four Thirds size CCD or CMOS sensor). Many bridge cameras have long zoom lenses which now often start at a super wide- angle focal length of 20 or 22mm equivalent focal length (in 35mm film camera terms), so the term \\"bridge camera\\" is sometimes used interchangeably with \\"megazoom\\", \\"superzoom\\", or \\"ultrazoom.\\" However, some bridge cameras have only moderate or short zooms (such as the Canon Powershot G9), while many compact cameras have superzoom lenses but lack the advanced functions of a bridge camera. With zoom ranges and sales rapidly increasing in the early 21st century, every major camera manufacturer has at least one 'super zoom' in its lineup. Sales of bridge cameras with DSLR-shape and MILC are steady in the overall context of declining camera sales.  One fixed but versatile lens  Bridge cameras typically have small image sensors, allowing their lenses also to be smaller than a 35mm or APS-C SLR lens covering the same zoom range. As a result, very large zoom ranges (from wide-angle to telephoto, including macro) are feasible with one lens. The typical bridge camera has a telephoto zoom limit of over 400mm (35mm equivalent), although some 21st-century cameras reach up to 2000mm. For this reason, bridge cameras typically fall into the category of superzoom cameras. The 24√ó Zoom Nikkor ED 4.6-110.4mm f2.8-5.0 on the Nikon Coolpix P90, which in 35 mm equivalent focal length terms is a 26-624mm.  LCDs and EVFs as principal viewfinders  Bridge cameras employ two types of electronic screens as viewfinders: The LCD and the electronic viewfinder (EVF). All bridge cameras have an LCD with live-preview and usually in addition either an EVF or an optical viewfinder (OVF) (non-parallax-free, as opposed to the OVF of DSLRs, which is parallax-free). A high-quality EVF is one of the advanced features that distinguish bridge cameras from consumer compact cameras. All DSLRs, by definition, have a through-the-lens OVF. Newer DSLR models typically also allow 'live view' on the LCD screen as an alternative to the OVF, although frequently without autofocus or with very slow autofocus. Mirrorless cameras and dSLTs use LCD or electronic viewfinders.  Electronic viewfinder (EVF) vs DSLR optical viewfinder (OVF) comparison  Live-preview EVF advantages = The EVF of bridge cameras, and the LCD of bridge cameras and DSLRs in \\"live view\\" mode continuously show the image generated by the sensor. The continuous digitally- generated live view has some advantages and disadvantages compared to the optically-generated view through the OVF of DSLRs. One advantage is that the digital preview is affected by all shooting settings and thus the image is seen as it will be recorded (in terms of things like exposure, white balance, etc.) which the OVF of DSLRs is incapable of showing. Another advantage is facilitating the framing from difficult angles by making the LCD movable (vari-angle). The LCD and EVF normally show 100% of the image while previewing (WYSIWYG). The OVF of professional DSLRs normally shows 100% of the image, but the OVF of consumer DSLRs may show slightly less than 100%. In addition, automatic modes tend to work better. The camera has a view of the full image, rather than the very limited information from an autofocus sensor, and can be much smarter about picking exposure, objects to focus on, and other settings. Finally, EVFs allow the viewfinder to show a range of information beyond the photo being taken. In particular, they allow for accurate image review, particularly in bright sunlight when the image would be washed out on a DSLR LCD. They can overlay a much richer array of focusing aids, levels, camera settings, and other information than a conventional DSLR viewfinder. = Live-preview EVF disadvantages = The electronic screens of some bridge cameras do not work as well as the OVF of DSLRs in situations of low light (although some work better, allowing high gain and slow refresh). For bridge cameras with EVFs, the LCD screen might be difficult to see and use for framing in bright daylight. Also, especially with older or lower-end cameras, the screen resolution and refresh rate may be limiting compared to the very high resolution and real time view provided by an optical path in the OVF of DSLRs. Low resolution impedes some forms of manual focusing, but most modern bridge cameras implement a method called focus zoom which automatically magnifies a central frame within the screen (manual focus point) to allow easier manual focusing. A slow refresh rate means that the image seen on the screen will have a fraction of a second lag or delay from the real scene being photographed. The electronic screens used in modern bridge cameras are gradually improving in their size, resolution, visibility, magnification and refresh rate. Continuous operation of the sensor shortens battery life and raises temperature. A DSLR's sensor (when not in live view mode) only operates when the shutter is open, and the electronic screen is typically off more, causing less battery drain. Sony Cyber-shot DSC-RX10 (2014) - a bridge camera that sports a large 1 inch sensor Panasonic LUMIX DMC-FZ1000 large sensor Bridge camera 1st Quarter Moon taken with Panasonic FZ1000 Large-sensor bridge cameras Just as in compact cameras, there is a trend towards larger sensors in bridge cameras, as well. Sony started the category of 1 inch sensor equipped bridge cameras in 2012 with the Sony Cyber-shot DSC-RX100, followed in late 2013 with the release of the Sony RX10. In 2014, Panasonic followed this with the FZ1000, which has a larger zoom range, up to 400mm equivalent (Sony's RX10 goes to 200mm equivalent). In contrast with the RX10's constant f/2.8 widest aperture Zeiss lens, the Panasonic FZ1000 has a variable f/2.8 to f/4 Leica creation. Sony's DSC-R1 issued as early as 2005 has a 10Mp APS-sized sensor combined with a Zeiss zoom lens. In terms of image quality, these cameras are comparable to Canon's DSLRs and similarly priced. # All measures are in pixels ImageSize = width:800 height:100 PlotArea = left:90 right:10 bottom:20 top:20 AlignBars = justify DateFormat = dd/mm/yyyy Period = from:2013 till:2019 TimeAxis = orientation:horizontal ScaleMajor = unit:year increment:1 start:2013 Define $dx = -40 # shift text # Dates from DPReview PlotData= bar:Panasonic_Lumix color:red width:20 mark:(line,white) align:left fontsize:S from:12/06/2014 till:16/07/2015 shift:($dx,14) text: DMC-FZ1000 from:16/07/2015 till:19/09/2016 shift:($dx,14) text: DMC-FZ300 from:19/09/2016 till:01/01/2019 shift:($dx,14) text: DMC-FZ2500 / FZ2000 bar:Sony_Cyber-shot color:blue width:20 mark:(line,white) align:left fontsize:S from:16/10/2013 till:10/06/2015 shift:($dx,14) text: DSC-RX10 from:10/06/2015 till:29/03/2016 shift:($dx,14) text: DSC-RX10 II from:29/03/2016 till:12/09/2017 shift:($dx,14) text: DSC-RX10 III from:12/09/2017 till:01/01/2019 shift:($dx,14) text: DSC-RX10 IV  Examples  Market  In late 2012, Techradar wrote that while the general compact camera market was on a downturn, the DSLR-like bridge camera market was continuing well.

The parish includes the hamlets of Thorley Street, Thorley Wash and Old Thorley, and is bordered at the north by the market town of Bishop's Stortford. History Thorley is listed in the Domesday book as \\"Torlei\\", belonging to Geoffrey de Mandeville, a notable Norman baron. During the reign of Edward the Confessor, Thorley Manor belonged to Earl Tostig. Thorley is less than one mile north from Blounts Farm in the adjoining parish of High Wych, the place where, in 1966, the criminal Harry Roberts was found by police during a long manhunt after he had participated in the Shepherd's Bush murders of three London-based policemen. He was found in a barn hiding under straw. Roberts was familiar with the area as he had often visited it as a child with his mother. Landmarks Thorley Church, dedicated to St James the Great, is a Grade I listed building. It dates to the 13th century and includes a Norman font and a three-seat sedilia. The pulpit was designed by George Gilbert Scott. There is a one-thousand-year-old yew tree in the graveyard, which also has the grave of Daniel Defoe's sister. The graveyard is entered through a lychgate dating from the 1920s. The stocks and whipping post that stood in the graveyard until the late 20th century have now been moved to the Bishop's Stortford Museum. Samuel Horsley was rector of the Church from 1779 to 1782, following in the footsteps of his father John, who was rector from 1745 to 1777.Bishop's Stortford and Thorley history and guide From 1594 to 1610, the rector was Francis Burley, one of the translators of the King James Bible. A 16th-century Tudor barn in the adjoining farm was converted from pig barn to a church and community centre - called the St Barnabas Centre - in 1996 with the help of a ¬£1 million endowment. Thorley Wash nature reserve is a Site of Special Scientific Interest owned and managed by the Herts and Middlesex Wildlife Trust between the village and the Stort Navigation.

Referred to by the media and his fans as \\"Action King\\" for his roles in action films, who works predominantly in Tamil cinema. He has also worked in Kannada and Telugu language films, while also performing in a few Malayalam and Hindi films. Arjun has acted in more than 150 movies, with most of them being lead roles. He is one of few South Indian actors to attract fan following from multiple states of India. He has directed 11 films and also produced and distributed a number of films. In 1993, he starred in S. Shankar's blockbuster Gentleman which opened to positive reviews, while Arjun went on to win the Tamil Nadu State Film Award for Best Actor. During this time, he starred in hits such as Jai Hind (1994), Karnaa (1995), and the action thriller film Kurudhipunal (1995), for which Arjun won acclaim for his role while the film became India's official entry for the 68th Academy Awards in the Best Foreign Language Film category. In 1999, he starred in the political action-thriller, Mudhalvan (1999), which earned him the Tamil Nadu State Film Award for Best Actor for his role as well as numerous other nominations. He was then featured in Vasanth's romantic drama film Rhythm, where he played a photographer, who eventually falls in love with a widow. Featuring a popular soundtrack and opening to positive reviews, Rhythm also became a commercial success. Arjun made appearances in the bilingual film Sri Manjunatha (2001) and the Telugu film Hanuman Junction (2001). In 2012, he appeared in the Kannada film Prasad, which screened at the Berlin Film Festival. He won the Karnataka State Film Award for Best Actor for his work in the film. The multilingual film Abhimanyu (2014) won the Karnataka State Film Award for Second Best Film. Personal life Sarja's father was Shakthi Prasad, a Kannada film actor, and his mother was Lakshmi, an art teacher. He had one elder brother Kishore Sarja, who directed Kannada films. He is married to Niveditha Arjun a former actress who has appeared in the 1986 Kannada film Ratha Sapthami under the stage name of Asha Rani. Kannada actor Rajesh is his father-in-law. Sarja has two daughters, Aishwarya and Anjana. Aishwarya Arjun made her acting debut in 2013. His nephews Chiranjeevi Sarja and Dhruva Sarja have acted in Kannada movies. Another nephew of Arjun, Bharat Sarja, will also be making his acting debut in 2013. Sarja, inspired by Bruce Lee's 1973 film Enter the Dragon, began training Karate at the age of 16 and now holds a black belt. Arjun had always thought and dreamt of becoming a police officer but his fate took him into an entirely different direction. Arjun is an ardent devotee of Hanuman. He is building the Hanuman temple at the outskirts of Chennai. A 35-foot statue of the Lord Anjaneya was sculpted exclusively for the temple and the statue of the Hanuman is in a sitting posture and weighs around 140 tonnes. The sitting posture of the Hanuman statue is first of its kind in India. The single-stone statue is in 35 feet high and 12 feet wide and 7 feet thick. Film career=1981-1985: Early career Arjun's father Shakti Prasad, a renowned actor of Kannada films, did not want his son to become an actor and turned down film offers that Arjun began to receive as a teenager. In a surprise move, film producer Rajendra Singh Babu managed to convince Arjun to begin shooting for a feature film for his production house without Shakti Prasad's express permission and consequently, his father agreed to Arjun's career choice. The film Simhada Mari Sainya (1981) featured him as a junior artiste and the director of the film gave him the stage name of Arjun, replacing his original name Ashok Babu. While he began to establish himself Kannada films, he received an offer from actor-producer A. V. M. Rajan and director Rama Narayanan to do a Tamil film Nandri (1984). Simultaneously he was offered a Telugu film, Kodi Ramakrishna's Maa Pallelo Gopaludu (1985) in Telugu too which went on to be a big success, running for a year in three centers. Arjun co-starred with Nalini and Jaishankar in the horror film Yaar? (1985), inspired by a Hollywood movie The Omen. Rajinikanth makes a cameo appearance. He then relocated himself to Telugu and Tamil and concentrated there. 1986-1991: Breakthrough His career as an actor began to take off in the mid-1980s and he sometimes worked for up to seven shifts in a day to keep up with the films he had committed to do. In Telugu, he starred in movies like Naga Devatha, Cowboy No. 1 and Manavadostunnadu. It was the film Shankar Guru with actress Seetha turned a new leaf in his sinking career. The production was also made by AVM Productions. The film was simulatenouly shot in Telugu as Chinnari Devatha. During the period of 1987 to 1988, Arjun became a main actor in Telegu, then acted in movies such Trimurtulu, Monagadu, Garjinchina Ganga, Nyayaniki Sankellu and Doctor Gari Abbai. In Tamil, many commercially successful such as Thaimel Aanai, Vettaiyaadu Vilaiyaadu, Padicha Pulla and Sonthakkaran. By 1990, his films lost box office value and he was out of work in Tamil and Telugu films for almost a year. In the late 1990s, his action films often carried a patriotic theme, though he was still able to attract prominent producers and directors. He continued with average films like Paattali Magan (1990), Aatha Naan Pass Ayittaen (1990), Thangaikku Oru Thalattu (1990), Thanga Thamaraigal (1991) and Enga Ooru Sippai (1991). 1992-2001: Critical acclaim In 1992, he worked alongside the veteran actor Sivaji Ganeshan in the movie Mudhal Kural. He subsequently chose to direct his feature film Sevagan, a crime story which opened to mixed reviews, but became a box office success. The next movie Annan Ennada Thambi Ennada with actor Sivakumar. Meanwhile, Arjun returns to the Kannada cinema with Snehada Kadalalli, Shivanaga and Alimayya. The latter was made by his brother Kishore Sarja. In 1993, Prathap and Gokulam received good reviews. Soon after, S. Shankar cast him in the lead role in his first film, Gentleman, after much persuasion. Arjun had initially rejected the film without listening to Shankar's narration but the director's persistence prompted him to feature in the film as a vigilante against corruption. The film opened to positive reviews and went on to become a trendsetter in the Tamil film industry, as well as achieving significant box office success, while Arjun went on to win the State Award for Best Actor. His change of fortune at the box office continued and Arjun began to gain ground as a bankable lead star in action films after his films including his patriotic directorial venture Jai Hind (1994) and Karnaa (1995), where he played a dual role, went on to become blockbusters. Kamal Haasan approached Arjun to play a police officer in the action thriller film Kurudhipunal (1995), and the actor jumped at the opportunity and agreed to do the film even without hearing the narration. Arjun won positive acclaim for his role, while the film became India's official entry for the 68th Academy Awards Best Foreign Language Film category. After a series of unsuccessful action films, including Sengottai (1996), Thaayin Manikodi (1998) and Suriya Paarvai (1999).

Arjun then briefly experimented in softer roles, portraying critically acclaimed characters of businessman with \\"shades of grey\\" in Prabhu Solomon's Kannodu Kanbathellam (1999). He teamed up again with Shankar in the political drama film Mudhalvan (1999). Portraying an ambitious TV journalist who receives the opportunity to become the Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu for a day, Arjun offered bulk dates for filming the project to Shankar. The film subsequently won positive reviews with Arjun described as having \\"acquitted himself with aplomb in the challenging role\\". Arjun received the Tamil Nadu State Film Award for Best Actor for his role as well as numerous other nominations. He play in the action film Sudhandhiram (2000), remake of Hindi film Ghulam. Later he plays a role as an energetic civil service officer in Vaanavil (2000).

Featuring a popular soundtrack and opening to positive reviews, Rhythm also became a commercial success, with a critic noting \\"Arjun is as polished as ever\\" and adding \\"who would have conceived this idea that the \\"Action King\\" could attempt a soft-natured role of this kind\\". He carried on with a lighter theme in his next directorial venture, the love story Vedham (2001), while he ventured into Telugu cinema again by appearing in Raja's Hanuman Junction and as a Hindu devotee in Sri Manjunatha (2001). 2002-2010: Commercial success  The image of \\"action king\\" made him popular with town and village centre audiences, who appreciate the actor's fight and stunt scenes. He thus actively chose to specialise in action films, often collaborating with directors who specialised in them such as Sundar C, Venkatesh and Selva. In the mid 2000s, he appeared in several action films with the same premise, often portraying a police officer or a local do-gooder. He directed and featured in lead roles in both the action films Ezhumalai (2002) and Parasuram (2003), while also being involved in Maharajan's Arasatchi (2004). Some of his films, Giri (2004) and Marudhamalai (2007), were box office successes, with several of his projects were not, including Madrasi (2006), Vathiyar (2006) and Durai (2008), in all of which he was the story writer. Despite not achieving any significant hit films in the 2000s, producers often considered Arjun as a \\"minimum guarantee\\" actor and felt his sizable fan following the four Southern States of India would help recover money even through dubbed versions. In a rare experimental film for him in the decade, he portrayed the role of the Hindu deity Hanuman in Krishna Vamsi's devotional film Sri Anjaneyam (2004) and worked on the film without receiving remuneration as a self-confessed worshipper of the deity. He was also cast for a change as a realistic police officer in Bharathiraja's critically acclaimed Bommalattam (2008), where a reviewer felt his \\"showcase of the soft, subtle yet unrelenting cop was noteworthy\\". Thiruvannamalai (2008), Rama Rama Krishna Krishna (2010), Vandae Maatharam (2010) and Vallakottai (2010) also came later. 2011-present  Since the turn of the decade, Arjun has attempted to move away from his \\"action king\\" image and accepted to star in films where he would play the antagonist or a supporting role, with the move drawing praise from film critics. In 2011, Arjun accepted the opportunity to play an extended guest role alongside Ajith Kumar in Venkat Prabhu's action thriller Mankatha, with critics praising his performance as a Police officer in the blockbuster. The following year he appeared in Kannada film Prasad, for which he won the Karnataka State Film Award for Best Actor. Portraying a middle-class father with a deaf and dumb son, Arjun noted it was a rewarding experience for him to break the monotony of his standard roles and attempt something different, admitting he was moved by the script. The film opened to unanimously positive reviews in March 2012 and then was selected to be screened at the Berlin Film Festival, with critics labelling Arjun's portrayal as a \\"stunning performance\\" and his \\"career-best\\". Arjun collaborated with Mani Ratnam with Kadal (2013), in which the actor portrayed a negative role of a smuggler in coastal Tamil Nadu. While the film opened to mixed reviews and became a box office failure, Arjun won rave reviews for his portrayal with Sify.com noting Arjun is \\"deliciously despicable in his career's most memorable negative role\\" and The Hindu labelling him as \\"brilliant\\". He then won acclaim for his portrayal of a real-life police officer K. Vijay Kumar in the bilingual film Vana Yuddham (2013), the biopic of notorious forest brigand Veerappan, as well as for his role of a paralysed swimming coach in Vasanth's romance film, Moondru Per Moondru Kadal (2013). His latest directorial venture, Jai Hind 2 (2014) contained a message about the declining state of the Indian education system. The film became a box office success in Kannada, while the Tamil version did not perform well at the box office. In 2016, he acted in Kannada film, Game. It was released in Tamil as Oru Melliya Kodu. The film has some good performances. Arjun and Shaam, both Bengaluru boys but doing Tamil films, are apt for their roles. The Kannada and Tamil version was a hit at the box office. In 2017, he marked in his 150th film Nibunan. It was simultaneously released in Kannada as Vismaya. Arjun looks stylish and suave as the fit and honest officer, and he excels in a couple of action blocks he gets. Varalaxmi and Prasanna have enough space for their roles and are as good as the protagonist's aides. Nibunan is indeed worth your money and time for it retains the suspense element for a predominant part, there are a lot of interesting ideas and of course Arjun. In 2018, he directed in the Kannada-Tamil movie Prema Baraha. The film stars Chandan Kumar and his daughter Aishwarya Arjun Prema Baraha has all the trademark elements of an Arjun Sarja film ‚Äì stunts, patriotic fervor and a touch of devotion for Lord Hanuman. The movie was a success in Kannada. It was released in Tamil as Sollividava but did not have an impact in the audience. He acted in Telugu Naa Peru Surya, Naa Illu India with Allu Arjun, followed by Irumbu Thirai, a Tamil action movie co-starred with Vishal. Arjun plays in a negative role. The film was a Blockbuster at the box office. He acted in pivotal roles such Kolaigaran (2019) then the multi-starrer Kurukshetra (2019). He plays the role of Karna by tales inspired from the Mahabharata. Following the Malayalam film, Jack & Daniel (2019) and Tamil movie Hero (2019). Arjun's upcoming project is the Malayalam film Marakkar: Arabikadalinte Simham which features an ensemble cast.

VADE RETRO SATANA (\\"Go back, Satan\\" or \\"Step back, Satan\\", \\"Back off, Satan\\") is a Medieval Catholic formula for exorcism, recorded in a 1415 manuscript found in the Benedictine Metten Abbey in Bavaria; its origin is traditionally associated with the Benedictines. The initials of this formula (VRSNSMV SMQLIVB or VRS:NSMV:SMQL:IVB) have often been engraved around crucifixes or Catholic Saint Benedict Medals at least since 1780.Journal of the British Archaeological Association, 1858, page 280Judith Sutera, 1997, The Work of God: Benedictine Prayer Published by Liturgical Press page 109Lea, Henry Charles (1896) page 520Ann Ball, 2003 Encyclopedia of Catholic Devotions and Practices pages 350‚Äì351 The phrase vade retro satana (often spelled vade retro satanas, or sathanas) is also used as a witty or scholarly prose device, dissociated from its religious implications, to express strong rejection of an unacceptable (but possibly tempting) proposal, or dread of some looming menace. Namely, in the sense of \\"do not tempt me!\\", \\"I will have nothing to do with that\\", \\"will someone deliver us from that\\", and so on.See for example: Sir Walter Scott, The Fortunes of Nigel, 1822, Ch. 31: \\"Ne inducas in tentationem‚ÄîVade retro, Sathanas!‚ÄîAmen.\\" Text Saint Benedict with a cross and a scroll stating Vade retro satana based on the last page of the 1415 book found in the library of Metten Abbey The Latin text says: :CRUX SACRA SIT MIHI LUX / NON DRACO SIT MIHI DUX :VADE RETRO SATANA / NUNQUAM SUADE MIHI VANA :SUNT MALA QUAE LIBAS / IPSE VENENA BIBAS In approximate translation: :\\"May the Holy Cross be my light / May the dragon never be my guide :Begone Satan / Never tempt me with your vanities :What you offer me is evil / drink the poison yourself.\\" Origins and history The verse VADE RETRO SATANA is similar to a phrase spoken by Jesus to Peter in the Vulgate New Testament, Gospel of Mark : vade retro me satana (\\"Get behind me Satan!\\"). ; The exact origin of the passage is not clear. It is found in an early thirteenth century legend of the Devil's Bridge at Sens, wherein an architect sold his soul to the devil and then subsequently repented. M. le Cur√© of Sens, wearing his stole, exorcised the devil, driving him away with holy water and these words, which he made the penitent repeat.\\"Odd Phrases in Literature\\", The Irish Quarterly Review, Volume 6, Part 1, 1856, note p. 683 Venerable Leo Dupont The passage came to general attention in 1647, when women who were prosecuted for witchcraft declared that they had been unable to do harm where there was a cross, and the St. Michael's Benedictine Abbey in Metten was particularly exempt from their influence.Mart√≠n de Elizalde, Revista Coloquio, n. 4. Italian translation: La Croce di San Benedetto (\\"The Cross of St. Benedict\\") A search of the monastery turned up crosses painted on the walls with the formula's initials. The meaning of those letters remained a mystery for some time, until the complete verses were found in a manuscript dating to 1415 in the abbey's library,Manuscript Clm 8210, Bavarian State Library next to an image of St. Benedict. The same formula was later found in an Austrian manuscript from 1340/50.Cod. Guelf. 35a Helmst. (Biblia pauperum, 14. Jh.), Wolfenb√ºttel Library, image 3 The manuscript depicts Satan offering a drinking cup to the Saint, who keeps him at bay with a long cross-topped staff carrying a red banner. Below the staff is a single line of text, and below it are six lines of verse, starting with \\"Vade retro Sathana\\". Satan offers a cup to the Saint, who keeps him at bay. (Detail from the medieval Austrian manuscript Heinemann Nr 40 first published around 1340.) The formula received the approval of Pope Benedict XIV, and became part of the Roman Catholic ritual in 1742. The formula's popularity grew considerably in the 19th century, mainly due to the efforts of Leo Dupont. According to H. C. Lea (1896), \\"As a rule ... it suffices to wear [the medal] devoutly, but, if some special favor is desired, it is advisable on a Tuesday to say five Glorias, three Aves and then three more Glorias to secure the protection of St. Benedict.\\"Lea, Henry Charles (1896) A History of Auricular Confession and Indulgences in the Latin Church; Volume III: Indulgences.

It is one of the most densely populated, but green part of Thiruvananthapuram. The land of Karamana is made fertile by the river, Karamana River which starts from the southern tip of the Western Ghats at \\"Agastyakoodam\\". The river flows 68 km westward and merges into the Arabian Sea at Thiruvallom-Karumam area near Kovalam.The Juma Masjid in Karamana is a famous landmark. Karamana is also known for its busy \\"Daily market\\" (a Farmers/Produce market) and is a major transit point for both trade and people travelling to or coming in from the Kanyakumari district of neighbouring Tamil Nadu. Etymology According to myths, 'Karamana' the place name came from a famous namboothiri (Kerala Brahmin) family who lived in the bank of the river. The life of people at that time was sticking around the Brahmin family. So, simply referring as the 'mana', meaning house on 'kara' meaning bank, became \\"Karamana\\". In the flow of time, this family became extinct and still the name is there. Civil Society and Administration Famous Sivan Kovil Typical wall sharing street - 'Theruvu' (Sankara Subbayyar Street) Karamana is situated inside the city limits of Thiruvananthapuram Corporation (TC). It is the 20th ward of TC and is represented by a Councillor in the Thiruvananthapuram Corporation Council. Like most parts of Trivandrum, Karamana too has a substantial non-Malayalam speaking population, which contributes immensely to the rich and vibrant cultural scene in Trivandrum. It has one of the oldest Tamil Brahmin settlements of Thiruvananthapuram and the old \\"Theruvu\\" style of wall-sharing town-houses, gives one a peek into the Brahmin life-style of yore. It maintains a large community of various religions and castes. Karamana is a model for secularism and religious/cultural tolerance. National Highway 47, the main travel and trade corridor of Kerala, passes through Karamana onward to the Central business districts of Thiruvananthapuram. Famous personalities Among many illustrious persons who had made Karamana their home was \\"Divan Bahadhur Veeraraghavapuram Nagamaiya\\" (Who incidentally, was the first Bachelor of Arts graduate in Kerala). The Divan (meaning \\"Minister\\" or \\"Grand Vizier\\") was one of the persons who contributed to the growth of the State of Travancore.

It was designed by Inigo Jones as part of a commission for the 4th Earl of Bedford in 1631 to create \\"houses and buildings fit for the habitations of Gentlemen and men of ability\\". As well as being the parish church of Covent Garden, the church has gained the nickname of \\"the actors' church\\" by a long association with the theatre community. Completed in 1633, St Paul's was the first entirely new church to be built in London since the Reformation. Its design and the layout of the square have been attributed to Inigo Jones since the 17th century, although firm documentary evidence is lacking. According to an often repeated story, recorded by Horace Walpole, Lord Bedford asked Jones to design a simple church \\"not much better than a barn\\", to which the architect replied \\"Then you shall have the handsomest barn in England\\". Nave and sanctuary The building is described by Sir John Summerson as \\"a study in the strictly Vitruvian Tuscan Order\\" and \\"almost an archaeological exercise\\".1st quote from next ref; 2nd quote from Summerson, John (1980), The Classical Language of Architecture, p. 13, 1980 edition, Thames and Hudson World of Art series, The description of a Tuscan or Etruscan-style temple by Vitruvius,Book iv, 7.2-3 which Jones closely follows in this building, reflects the early forms of Roman temple, which essentially continued Etruscan architecture, though quite what Vitruvius intended by his account has divided modern scholars.Among other things, it is not clear if Vitruvius was acting as an architectural historian, describing a building type that was no longer newly built by his day, even though his account tells \\"how to\\" design such a temple. It has been seen as a work of deliberate primitivism: the Tuscan order is associated by Palladio with agricultural buildings. The temple front with a portico on the square has never in fact been the main entrance, although this may have been Jones's first intention. The altar lies behind this wall, and the entrance is at the far end to this. The stone facing of this facade is also later; originally it was apparently brick with stucco. The other sides of the building remain brick, with details in stone. The triangular pediments at both ends are in wood. History West end with entrance The nave from the altar In 1630, the 4th Earl of Bedford was given permission to demolish buildings on an area of land he owned north of the Strand, and redevelop it. The result was the Covent Garden Piazza, the first formal square in London. The new buildings were classical in character. At the west end was a church, linked to two identical houses. The south side was left open. Work on the church was completed in 1633, at a cost to the Bedford estate of ¬£4,886, but it was not consecrated until 1638 due to a dispute between the earl and the vicar of St Martin-in-the-Fields. It remained a chapel within the parish of St Martin-in-the-Fields until January 1646, when Covent Garden was made a separate parish and the church dedicated to St. Paul. In 1789 there was a major restoration of the church, under the direction of the architect Thomas Hardwick. Six years later, in September 1795, the church was burnt out by a fire, accidentally started by workmen on the roof. A survey of the damage found that the outer walls were still structurally sound, but that the portico would have to be reconstructed. It is unclear whether this was in fact done. Having been restored once more, again under Hardwick's supervision, the church was reconsecrated on 1 August 1798. Despite the destruction, the parish records were saved, as was the pulpit ‚Äî the work of Grinling Gibbons. The puritan Thomas Manton ministered from the pulpit of St Paul's until the Great Ejection. On 23 September 1662 Simon Patrick, later Bishop of Ely, was preferred to the rectory of St. Paul's where he served during the plague. The first known victim of the 1665‚Äì1666 outbreak of the Plague in England, Margaret Ponteous, was buried in the churchyard on 12 April 1665. Architecture Wenceslas Hollar, before 1677 Covent Garden Piazza painted in 1737 by Balthazar Nebot The east end, facing the piazza, is now faced in stone, with a massive portico, its boldly-projecting pediment supported by two columns and two piers. There were originally three doorways behind the portico; the middle one, which survives, was built as a false door as the interior wall behind it is occupied by the altar. The other two were blocked up in the 19th century, when the chancel floor was raised. The main entrance to the church is through the plainer west front, which has a pediment, but no portico. William Prynne, writing in 1638 said that it was originally intended to have the altar at the west end, but pressure from the church hierarchy led to the imposition of the traditional orientation. The earliest existing detailed description, dating from 1708, says that the exterior was not of bare brick, but rendered with stucco. In 1789 it was decided to case the walls in Portland stone as part of a major programme of renovation, which Thomas Hardwick was chosen to supervise. At the same time the tiled roof was replaced with slate, the dormer windows, added in the 1640s, were removed, and the archways flanking the church, originally of stuccoed brick, were replaced with stone replicas. When Hardwick's stone facing was removed from the church in 1888, it was found to be a thin covering less than three inches thick, poorly bonded to the brick. The building was then reclad in the present unrendered red brick. There were originally six or seven steps leading up to the portico, but these disappeared as the level of the Piazza was raised gradually over the years. By 1823 there were only two steps visible, and none by 1887. The arches at the side of the portico were substantially widened and raised during a restoration of 1878‚Äì82 by Henry Clutton, The 9th Duke of Bedford's architect. Clutton also removed the bell- turret over the western pediment. The interior is a single space, undivided by piers or columns. The eastern third was originally marked out as a chancel by means of the floor being raised by one step. The level was raised further during alterations by William Butterfield in 1871‚Äì72. The church was built without galleries, but they were soon added on three sides. Hardwick included them in his rebuilding, and the western one remains today. To the sides of the portico there were two elaborate pedimented gateways to the churchyard that were removed, then replaced, continuing the \\"Tuscan\\" style. Plans and historical images show a variety of relatively small structures rising from the roof, some shown housing bells. The roof is now completely bare, and two bells can be seen in recesses cut high on the western facade. The portico was a great inspiration for Roger Morris (1695 - 1749) when designing the stable block for Althorp House, Northamptonshire, which is believed to have been built between 1732 and 1733. In the Palladian style and constructed of local ironstone, the east and north sides of the stables feature the deep porticos, both of which face the house. Many architectural historians have expressed the view that the stables are of more architectural importance than the house itself, which is rather more plain in comparison as a result of many centuries of alterations, including a major exterior renovation by Henry Holland (1745 - 1806) in the 1790s. Spencer, Charles, Althorp, the Story of an English House, 1998 Theatrical connections St Paul's connection with the theatre began as early as 1663 with the establishment of the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane, and was further assured in 1723 with the opening of Covent Garden Theatre, now the Royal Opera House. On 9 May 1662, Samuel Pepys noted in his diary the first \\"Italian puppet play\\" under the portico ‚Äî the first recorded performance of \\"Punch and Judy\\", a fact commemorated by the annual MayFayre service in May. The portico of St Paul's was the setting for the first scene of Shaw's Pygmalion, the play that was later adapted as My Fair Lady. Since 2007 St Paul's has been home to its own in-house professional theatre company, Iris Theatre, originally created to mount a production of T.S. Eliot‚Äôs Murder in the Cathedral. It gained full charitable status in October 2009. Baptisms, burials and memorials The artist J. M. W. Turner and dramatist Sir William S. Gilbert (of Gilbert and Sullivan fame) were both baptised at St Paul's. Samuel Butler (1613‚Äì1680), of Hudibras fame, was buried at St. Paul's, Covent Garden. Aubrey in Brief Lives describes his grave as \\"being in the north part next to the church at the east end.. 2 yards distant from the pillaster of the dore\\".John Aubrey. Brief Lives, chiefly of Contemporaries, ed. Andrew Clark, (Oxford, Clarendon Press 1898) vol. 1, p.136. His grave was never marked. A monument to him was placed in Westminster Abbey in 1732 by a printer with the surname Barber, and the Lord Mayor of London.Arthur Penrhyn Stanley. Historical Memorials of Westminster Abbey. Fourth ed. (London, John Murray, 1868), p. 280. Among others also buried at St Paul's, Covent Garden, are the wood-carver Grinling Gibbons, the painters Sir Peter Lely and Thomas Girtin, and Thomas Arne (composer of \\"Rule Britannia\\"). A memorial tablet in the church commemorates Charles Macklin, the great Shakespearean actor from Ulster. The ashes of Dame Ellen Terry and Dame Edith Evans rest in St Paul's. Memorials in the church are dedicated to many famous personalities of the 20th century, including Sir Charlie Chaplin, Sir No√´l Coward, Gracie Fields, Stanley Holloway, Boris Karloff, Vivien Leigh, Ivor Novello and Richard Beckinsale. The Avenue of Stars, which commemorated many notable figures and groups from the entertainment industry, formerly passed outside the church. There is also a memorial plaque to music hall star Bransby Williams which was unveiled by Sir Michael Redgrave. The church is surrounded by an award-winning graveyard garden. The churchyard closed to burials in 1852. In 2002, the church hosted the first of two weddings (the other one was held in Los Angeles) for famous musicians Gwen Stefani and Gavin Rossdale. Notable events In the 1980s, the site directly outside the church was where the then Greater London Council, soon to be abolished, liked to showcase bands, as part of its \\"Street Performers\\" policy for using public open spaces, and the Council then controlled the Covent Garden Piazza. On Sunday, 1 April 1984, the first samba school in Britain, the London School of Samba (LSS), performed its first ever public concert on this site. Its second concert, on Saturday, 7 April 1984, also took place outside the church. The LSS had been formed on 31 January 1984 and was considered to be the Madrinha, or \\"godmother\\", of samba in the United Kingdom. Later in 1984, the LSS was also the first school of samba to parade in the Notting Hill Carnival.history at londonschoolofsamba.co.uk John Whitworth, a professor at the Guildhall School of Music, was organist of the church from 1965 to 1971.Garry Humphreys, John Whitworth: Celebrated countertenor, in The Independent, 15 September 2013, accessed 20 June 2020 Orchestra Covent Garden Sinfonia (known as the Orchestra of St Paul's until June 2017) is a professional chamber orchestra resident at the Actors' Church.

History The abbey was founded in 997 under Emperor Otto III. The first abbot, Gregor, who came to Burtscheid from Calabria, is sometimes said to have been the brother of Theophanu, Byzantine mother of the Emperor. He was buried beneath the altar after his death in 999, and his date of death, 4 November, was kept as a feast day until the dissolution of the abbey. In 1018 the Emperor Henry II endowed it with the surrounding territory. Also at about this time the monastery was raised to the status of an abbey, and the dedication was changed from Saints Nicholas and Apollinaris to Saints John the Baptist and Nicholas. In 1138, the abbey was made reichsfrei by Conrad III, being granted Imperial immediacy, the privilege of being subject only to the Holy Roman Emperor, rather than to an intermediate lord. The abbey was under the Vogtei (loosely \\"protectorship\\") of the Barony of M√©rode until the abbey purchased its Vogtei from them, in 1649. In 1220, under Emperor Frederick II and his chancellor, Archbishop Engelbert of Cologne, the Benedictines were evicted and replaced by Cistercian nuns who had previously been living at the Salvatorberg in Aachen, to whom the abbey's possessions were transferred. At the same time the abbey's reichsfreiheit was confirmed. The abbey church was rebuilt in the mid-14th century, and again between 1735 and 1754 by the architect J.J. Couven. In 1779, despite the refusal of permission by the council of Aachen, who by that time were responsible for local government in Burtscheid, the then abbess introduced a gambling house, and the street is still known today as Krugenofen Kasinostrasse. Burtscheid was occupied by French troops in December 1792, and from September 1794 until 1804. They used the abbey church for the manufacture of balloons. In August 1802 the nunnery was secularised and dissolved. The remaining abbey buildings are now used by a school and for residential and administrative purposes.

Cumulate rocks are named according to their texture; cumulate texture is diagnostic of the conditions of formation of this group of igneous rocks. Cumulates can be deposited on top of other older cumulates of different composition and colour, typically giving the cumulate rock a layered or banded appearance. Formation Schematic diagrams showing the principles behind fractional crystallisation in a magma. While cooling, the magma evolves in composition because different minerals crystallize from the melt. 1: olivine crystallizes; 2: olivine and pyroxene crystallize; 3: pyroxene and plagioclase crystallize; 4: plagioclase crystallizes. At the bottom of the magma reservoir, a cumulate rock forms. Cumulate rocks are the typical product of precipitation of solid crystals from a fractionating magma chamber. These accumulations typically occur on the floor of the magma chamber, although they are possible on the roofs if anorthite plagioclase is able to float free of a denser mafic melt. Cumulates are typically found in ultramafic intrusions, in the base of large ultramafic lava tubes in komatiite and magnesium rich basalt flows and also in some granitic intrusions. Terminology Cumulates are named according to their dominant mineralogy and the percentage of crystals to their groundmass (Hall, 1996). * Adcumulates are rocks containing ~100‚Äì93% accumulated magmatic crystals in a fine-grained groundmass. * Mesocumulates are rocks with between 93 and 85% accumulated minerals in a groundmass. * Orthocumulates are rocks containing between 85 and 75% accumulated minerals in groundmass. Cumulate rocks are typically named according to the cumulate minerals in order of abundance, and then cumulate type (adcumulate, mesocumulate, orthocumulate), and then accessory or minor phases. For example: * A layer with 50% plagioclase, 40% pyroxene, 5% olivine and 5% groundmass (in essence a gabbro) would be termed a plagioclase-pyroxene Adcumulate with accessory olivine. * A rock consisting of 80% olivine, 5% magnetite and 15% groundmass is an olivine mesocumulate, (in essence a peridotite). Cumulate terminology is appropriate for use when describing cumulate rocks. In intrusions which have a uniform composition and minimal textural and mineralogical layering or visible crystal accumulations it is inappropriate to describe them according to this convention. Geochemistry Layers of cumulate rock (gabbro) in Oman Cumulate rocks, because they are fractionates of a parental magma, should not be used to infer the composition of a magma from which they are formed. The chemistry of the cumulate itself can inform on the residual melt composition, but several factors need to be considered.  Chemistry  The chemistry of a cumulate can inform upon the temperature, pressure and chemistry of the melt from which it was formed, but the number of minerals which co-precipitate need to be known, as does the chemistry or mineral species of the precipitated minerals. This is best illustrated by an example; As an example, a magma of basalt composition that is precipitating cumulates of anorthite plagioclase plus enstatite pyroxene is changing composition by the removal of the elements which make up the precipitated minerals. In this example, the precipitation of anorthite (a calcium aluminium feldspar) removes calcium from the melt, which becomes more depleted in calcium. Enstatite being precipitated from the melt will remove magnesium, so the melt becomes depleted in these elements. This tends to enrich the concentration of other elements - typically sodium, potassium, titanium and iron. The rock that is made of the accumulated minerals will not have the same composition as the magma. In the above example, the cumulate of anorthite + enstatite is rich in calcium and magnesium, and the melt is depleted in calcium and magnesium. The cumulate rock is a plagioclase-pyroxene cumulate (a gabbro) and the melt is now more felsic and aluminous in composition (trending towards andesite compositions). In the above example, the plagioclase and pyroxene need not be pure end-member compositions (anorthite-enstatite), and thus the effect of depletion of elements can be complex. The minerals can be precipitated in any ratio within the cumulate; such cumulates can be 90% plagioclase:10% enstatite, through to 10% plagiclase:90% enstatite and remain a gabbro. This also alters the chemistry of the cumulate, and the depletions of the residual melt. It can be seen that the effect on the composition of the residual melt left behind by the formation of the cumulate is dependent on the composition of the minerals which precipitate, the number of minerals which co-precipitate at the same time, and the ratio of the minerals which co-precipitate. In nature, cumulates usually form from 2 mineral species, although ranges from 1 to 4 mineral species are known. Cumulate rocks which are formed from one mineral alone are often named after the mineral, for example a 99% magnetite cumulate is known as a magnetitite. A specific example is the Skaergaard intrusion in Greenland. At Skaergaard a 2500 m thick layered intrusion shows distinct chemical and mineralogic layering:Hall, Anthony, Igneous Petrology, 1987, Longman, p. 228-231, * Plagioclase varies from An66 near the base to An30 near the top (Anxx = anorthite percentage) ** CaO 10.5% base to 5.1% top; Na2O + K2O 2.3% base to 5.9% top * Olivine varies from Fo57 near the base to Fo0 at the top (Foxx = forsterite percentage of the olivine) ** MgO 11.6% base to 1.7% top; FeO 9.3% base to 22.7% top The Skaergaard is interpreted to have crystallised from a single confined magma chamber.  Residual melt chemistry  One way to infer the composition of the magma that created the cumulate rocks is to measure groundmass chemistry, but that chemistry is problematic or impossible to sample. Otherwise, complex calculations of averaging cumulate layers must be utilised, which is a complex process. Alternatively, the magma composition can be estimated by assuming certain conditions of magma chemistry and testing them on phase diagrams using measured mineral chemistry. These methods work fairly well for cumulates formed in volcanic conditions (i.e.; komatiites). Investigating magma conditions of large layered ultramafic intrusions is more fraught with problems. These methods have their drawbacks, primarily that they must all make certain assumptions which rarely hold true in nature. The foremost problem is that in large ultramafic intrusions, assimilation of wall rocks tends to alter the chemistry of the melt as time progresses, so measuring groundmass compositions may fall short. Mass balance calculations will show deviations from expected ranges, which may infer assimilation has occurred, but then further chemistry must be embarked upon to quantify these findings. Secondly, large ultramafic intrusions are rarely sealed systems and may be subject to regular injections of fresh, primitive magma, or to loss of volume due to further upward migration of the magma (possibly to feed volcanic vents or dyke swarms). In such cases, calculating magma chemistries may resolve nothing more than the presence of these two processes having affected the intrusion. Though crystallized at high temperature, cumulate can remelt when later intruded by a sill or dyke of magma.J. Leuthold, J. C. Lissenberg, B. O‚ÄôDriscoll, O. Karakas; T. Falloon, D.N. Klimentyeva, P. Ulmer (2018); Partial melting of the lower oceanic crust at spreading ridges. Frontiers in Earth Sciences: Petrology: 6(15): 20p; https://dx.doi.org/10.3389/feart.2018.00015  Economic importance  The economic importance of cumulate rocks is best represented by three classes of mineral deposits found in ultramafic to mafic layered intrusions. * Silicate mineral cumulates * Oxide mineral cumulates * Sulfide melt cumulates  Silicate mineral cumulates  Silicate minerals are rarely sufficiently valuable to warrant extraction as ore. However, some anorthosite intrusions contain such pure anorthite concentrations that they are mined for feldspar, for use in refractories, glassmaking, semiconductors and other sundry uses (toothpaste, cosmetics, etc.).  Oxide mineral cumulates  Dark layers of chromite-rich cumulate rock alternating with light layers of plagioclase-rich rock in the Bushveld Igneous Complex, South Africa Oxide mineral cumulates form in layered intrusions when fractional crystallisation has progressed enough to allow the crystallisation of oxide minerals which are invariably a form of spinel. This can happen due to fractional enrichment of the melt in iron, titanium or chromium. These conditions are created by the high- temperature fractionation of highly magnesian olivine or pyroxene, which causes a relative iron-enrichment in the residual melt. When the iron content of the melt is sufficiently high, magnetite or ilmenite crystallise and, due to their high density, form cumulate rocks. Chromite is generally formed during pyroxene fractionation at low pressures, where chromium is rejected from the pyroxene crystals. These oxide layers form laterally continuous deposits of rocks containing in excess of 50% oxide minerals. When oxide minerals exceed 90% of the bulk of the interval the rock may be classified according to the oxide mineral, for example magnetitite, ilmenitite or chromitite. Strictly speaking, these would be magnetite orthocumulate, ilmenite orthocumulate and chromite orthocumulates.  Sulfide mineral segregations  Sulfide mineral cumulates in layered intrusions are an important source of nickel, copper, platinum group elements and cobalt. Deposits of a mixed massive or mixed sulfide-silicate 'matrix' of pentlandite, chalcopyrite, pyrrhotite and/or pyrite are formed, occasionally with cobaltite and platinum-tellurium sulfides. These deposits are formed by melt immiscibility between sulfide and silicate melts in a sulfur-saturated magma. They are not strictly a cumulate rock, as the sulfide is not precipitated as a solid mineral, but rather as immiscible sulfide liquid. However, they are formed by the same processes and accumulate due to their high specific gravity, and can form laterally extensive sulfide 'reefs'. The sulfide minerals generally form an interstitial matrix to a silicate cumulate. Sulfide mineral segregations can only be formed when a magma attains sulfur saturation. In mafic and ultramafic rocks they form economic nickel, copper and platinum group (PGE) deposits because these elements are chalcophile and are strongly partitioned into the sulfide melt. In rare cases, felsic rocks become sulfur saturated and form sulfide segregations. In this case, the typical result is a disseminated form of sulfide mineral, usually a mixture of pyrrhotite, pyrite and chalcopyrite, forming copper mineralisation. It is very rare but not unknown to see cumulate sulfide rocks in granitic intrusions.

He is Pro-Chancellor of the University of Aberdeen, Honorary Professor of Early Christian Doctrine and Ethics at the University of Edinburgh, President and Professor of Patristics Emeritus at Princeton Theological Seminary, and an Extra Chaplain to Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II in Scotland. He was formerly Moderator of the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland, Dean of the Chapel Royal in Scotland, and Dean of the Order of the Thistle. He is married to Morag Ann (n√©e MacHugh), whom he met while they were students at the University of St Andrews, and they have two children. Biography Torrance was born in Aberdeen, Scotland. He is the younger son of Thomas Forsyth Torrance, Moderator of the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland in 1976. He was educated at the Edinburgh Academy and at Monkton Combe School in Bath, then graduated MA (University of Edinburgh), BD (University of St Andrews), DPhil (Oriel College, Oxford). His doctoral thesis was entitled A translation of the letters between Severus of Antioch and Sergius the Grammarian, with a theological introduction, and was supervised by Sebastian Brock. Following Oxford, Torrance was ordained on 23 January 1982 by the Church of Scotland's Presbytery of Shetland as minister at Northmavine Parish Church in the Shetland Islands. Northmavine is the most northerly parish on the main island of the Shetland archipelago, and is famous for the stunning cliff scenery of Eshaness. He was also commissioned as a Territorial Army chaplain serving with 2/51 Highland and then the Royal Army Medical Corps from 1982 to 1997. After serving for four years in Northmavine, in 1985 Torrance moved to The Queen's College, Birmingham, an ecumenical theological college (mainly Anglican and Methodist) with strong links to the University of Birmingham. There, he taught New Testament studies. In 1989 he moved to a lectureship in Patristics and New Testament at the University of Birmingham. He was invited to become a member of the International Dialogue between The World Alliance of Reformed Churches (WARC) and the Orthodox Church in 1992, becoming co-chair in 1995. In 1993, he moved to the University of Aberdeen, subsequently being promoted to a personal chair and becoming Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Divinity in 2001. In 2001 he was appointed a Chaplain- in-Ordinary to Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II in Scotland. He served as Moderator of the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland in 2004, continuing in that office until the appointment of Alison Elliot the following year. In 2005 he represented the Church of Scotland and the WARC at the installation of Pope Benedict XVI. In 2008, he represented the WARC at the Lambeth Conference. Torrance appears as himself in Alexander McCall Smith‚Äôs Edinburgh novels, The Comforts of a Muddy Saturday (2008) and The Forgotten Affairs of Youth (2011). The composer Paul Mealor dedicated to Torrance the anthem which he had been commissioned to write for the UK and Commonwealth Commemoration of World War One in Glasgow Cathedral on 4 August 2014. In July 2013 The Queen appointed Torrance Dean of the Chapel Royal in Scotland, and in July 2014 she appointed him Dean of the Order of the Thistle. He retired from these posts in July 2019. Moderator of the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland Iain Torrance's tenure as Moderator of the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland (2003-2004) was marked by a nationally reported controversy following his public comments on homosexuality in which he stated that he was \\"utterly untroubled\\" by the ordination of gay clergy. The context was the nomination of Canon Jeffrey John as Bishop of Reading. Doctor Torrance thereby became the first leader to encourage gay ordination in the Church of Scotland's 500-year history, a stance that marked a major shift in the Church's view and which was met with fierce opposition. Torrance subsequently used a Christmas sermon as a platform to challenge homophobia within his own church. The Reverend David W. Lacy, one of Torrance's successors as Moderator, publicly opposed this stance, arguing that the appointment of openly gay ministers would rip the Church of Scotland apart. When asked to comment on some public criticism by fellow ministers, Torrance said of his critics: \\"I am not convinced that their vision and my vision need collide in such a way that one must consume the other. There is room for both, and a lively Church needs both those who are zealous in upholding tradition and those who probe its boundaries.\\" His year in office also saw the first official call for the release of the Abdelbaset al-Megrahi, a Libyan national imprisoned for the bombing of Pan Am Flight 103, informally known as the Lockerbie bombing. Furthermore, Nelson Mandela had also called for the support of the Western Christian Churches in what the South African lawyer considered a clear miscarriage of justice. Torrance made representation to the British Prime Minister Tony Blair on behalf of Megrahi pointing out the deep unease in Scotland and elsewhere over the safety of the verdict.Jeans, Chris. The Case of the Lockerbie Bomber. Al Jazeere documentary, June 2011. During his year in office, Torrance travelled widely on behalf of the Church, being the first Moderator to visit the churches in China. At some personal risk, in February 2004, he visited every British unit in Southern Iraq. He visited the demilitarized zone in Eritrea as the guest of the United Nations peacekeeping force and preached in southern Sudan. His formal title following the end of his Moderatorial year is the Very Reverend Professor Iain Torrance. President of Princeton Theological Seminary Iain Torrance took up his appointment as the sixth president of Princeton Theological Seminary on 1 July 2004 and was installed as President and Professor of Patristics, on 11 March 2005, at a service in the Princeton University Chapel. The inauguration featured more than 64 delegates from institutions of higher education including the four ancient universities of Scotland (St. Andrews, Glasgow, Aberdeen and Edinburgh) as well as The Chapel Royal in Scotland, Yale University Divinity School, Duke University, and Howard University School of Divinity. Twelve ecclesiastical delegates, including Rick Ufford-Chase, the Moderator of the Presbyterian Church (USA), attended. The service also highlighted \\"Christ is the World‚Äôs Redeemer,\\" a hymn written by John Ferguson and commissioned by Princeton Theological Seminary for the inauguration. At Princeton Theological Seminary, Torrance was active in the review of existing programs, both academic and financial. He was committed to the renovation of the seminary library (opened in January 2013, a month after he retired) and the rebuilding of student housing on the Charlotte Rachel Wilson campus (completed in May 2012). Torrance has been committed to inter-faith dialogue, being a public supporter of the Muslim document A Common Word Between Us and You (2007). In August 2010, he was elected to the C-1 Religious Leader Commission. Torrance retired from the presidency of Princeton Theological Seminary on 31 December 2012.

This is mainly because of the islands' isolation, and also because the Faroese language was not written down in a standardised format until 1890. Until then the Danish language was encouraged at the expense of Faroese. Nevertheless, the Faroese language soon became a vehicle for literature in its own right and has produced writers in several genres. No sagas were created in the Faroe Islands, but In the 13th century the F√¶reyinga saga (Saga of the Faroe Islanders) was written in Iceland. It tells the story of the settlement and early history of the Faroe Islands, though it is doubtful if it is entirely historically accurate. Faroese letters survive from the 13th and 14th centuries, and Faroese ballads were collected in the 17th century. In the Middle Ages many poems and stories were handed down orally. These works were split into the following divisions: sagnir (historical), √¶vintyr (stories) and kv√¶√∞i (ballads, traditionally sung along with the Faroese chain dance, in modern times also used in modern Faroese music). These kv√¶√∞i were eventually written down in the 19th century. They are still used in Faroese dance without any use of instruments. One of the first Faroese writers was the early 19th century liberal N√≥lsoyar P√°ll - Poul Poulson N√≥lsoy, who tried to end the trading monopoly that was affecting the islands. He wrote many poems, including his most famous work Fuglakv√¶√∞i. Later poets include the brothers Janus and Hans Andreas Djurhuus, and R√≥i Patursson. Other famous authors from the Faroes include He√∞in Br√∫ (The Old Man and His Sons), J√∏rgen-Frantz Jacobsen (who wrote in Danish and is known for his sole novel Barbara) and William Heinesen (The Black Cauldron), who also wrote in Danish. Both Heinesen and Patursson were awarded The Nordic Council's Literature Prize.

Dicuil built on older sources, but added information of his own regarding, for example, the location of the Faroe Islands. According to the Faroe Saga, the Faroe Islands belonged to the crown of Norway and were converted to Christianity by Sigmund Brestirsson. * C. 990 ‚Äì The Magnus Cathedral in Kirkjeb√∏ in Streymoy was erected but never finished. * 1298 Sey√∞abr√¶vi√∞ (\\"The Sheep Letter\\").

These were collected by for him by Faroese and sent to him in 1639. These are only known now in secondary sources, because of the fire in Copenhagen in 1728. * 1593 the Icelandic Arngr√≠mur J√≥nsson published a Latin text called Brevis Commentarius de Islandia, where the Faroe Islands are mentioned as ‚ÄúInsul√¶, qu√¶ ab ovium multitudine F√¶reyar, seu rectius Faareyjar, dict√¶ sunt...‚Äù ‚Äì \\"here we see, that it is the number of sheep, that have given the Islands their name\\" (although they are spelled as ‚ÄúFer√∏ier‚Äù, ‚ÄúFaar√∏‚Äù, ‚ÄúFier√∏‚Äú). J√≥nsson published another text called Crymogaea (printed in Hamburg), where he writes about the many sheep on the Faroe Islands. * 15th century Historia Norwegi√¶. It was published by P. A. Munch in 1850 under the name Symbol√¶ ad Historiam Antiquiorem Rerum Norwegicarum. The text was written in the 15th century, but it relies on older sources, some dating back to the 12th century. ‚ÄùHistoria Norwegi√¶‚Äù deals with Norway and the western islands, the Orkney Islands, the Faroe Islands and Iceland. * 1665-67 Peder Jacobsen Spjellerup was a priest in the Northern Parish of Str√∏moy. He wrote the first study of the Faroe Islands, though later his work was lost. * ‚ÄùFer√∏ers Beskrifvelser‚Äù by Thomas Tharnovius. He was born in 1644 in Rostock and his father became the priest on Su√∞uroy. Tharnovius studied Latin with the priest Lucas Debes. Later he studied theology at the University of Copenhagen, where he graduated in 1669. His work on the Faroe Islands is not as thorough as that of Debes (1673). * 1592 Norriges oc omliggende √òers sandf√¶rdige Bescriffuelser by Peder Clauss√∏n Friis (published in 1632).

In 1673 Lucas Debes published F√¶ro√¶ & F√¶roa Reserata. It was later published in English (1675) and in German (1757) and a part of it was translated into Icelandic as well. * 1695 The Icelandic-Norwegian historian and professor Th. Torf√¶us (also known as √ûorm√≥√∞ur Torfason 1636‚Äì1719), published his work Commentatio historica de rebus gestis F√¶reyensium in Copenhagen and later it was published in 1770 as Historisk Beretning om Indbyggernes Bedrifter paa F√¶r√∏erne. He also wrote on the Orkney Islands in Orkn√∏erne (1697), Gr√∏nland (1706) and Gr√∏nlands ‚Äòvedh√¶ng‚Äô Vinland (1705). In 1695 Thorf√¶us published Leivskv√¶√∞i (\\"The Ballad of Leif\\"), the first Faroese ballad to be put into print. * 1728 Johan Hendrik Weyhe wrote a Faroese grammar which was ready for publication when it was lost the same year in the fire in Copenhagen. He also wrote a number of religious texts, Nogle vigtige Troens Articler, forestillende udi sytten Pr√¶dikkener (sic), from 1733. * 1742‚Äì1790 Nicolai Mohr, Faroese scientist. Educated at the University of Copenhagen in economy and natural science. He did important work on Iceland: Fors√∏g til en islandsk Naturhistorie (1786). * 1746‚Äì1824 J.C. Svabo, son of a priest, studied at the University of Copenhagen. He collected ballads, did topographical work and worked as a writer and as a scientist. The work Indberetninger fra en Reise i F√¶r√∏e 1781 og 1782, his magnum opus, was not published as a whole before 1959. * 1751‚Äì61 Two Faroese students wrote on Faroese matters. Gregers M√∏ller (1727‚Äì1804), made a speech on Regensen in 1751 about Str√∏m√∏: Declamatio in insulam F√∏roensem Str√∏m√∏e. The other, Christopher M√ºller (1732‚Äì1804), wrote a ‚Äùdissertation‚Äù (a paper that was made the basis for a ‚Äùdisputation‚Äù) in 1761. The topic was the possibility of the Faroes gaining a greater income from agriculture. * 1756 Friedrich Christian Pelt published Der F√§r√∂ische Robinson (The Faroese Robinson). The book was very poorly written and its 840 pages were published in Copenhagen and in Leipzig. * 1766‚Äì1808 N√≥lsoyar P√°ll. Sailor and poet. In 1806 he wrote the allegorical and anti-Danish ‚ÄúFuglakv√¶√∞i‚Äù, the Bird Ballad. * 1771‚Äì1851 J.H. Schr√∏ter, Danish-Faroese priest in Su√∞uroy, translator and publisher.

Later some of the books from this expedition were published: Wright, James: The Journals of the Stanley Expedition to the Faroe Islands and Iceland in 1789. Thorshavn, 1970. * 1796 Lars Hess Bing published a chapter on the Faroe Islands in his great work Beskrivelse over Kongeriget Norge, √òerne Island og F√¶r√∏erne samt Gr√∏nland efter √¶ldre og nyere, trykte og haandskrevne geografiske, chorographiske, topographiske, statistiske Skrivter, Afhandlinger og Efterretninger, saavelsom ved Brevvexling og ellers erholdte Oplysninger, forfattet i alphabetisk Orden, published in Copenhagen in 1796 * 1800 the Danish priest J√∏rgen Landts published a work on the Faroe Islands: Fors√∏g til en Beskrivelse over F√¶r√∏erne. Most of it is stolen from Svabo and Debes. Abouts Svabo he said, ‚ÄùA student, Jens Svabo, has given some written notes on Faroe,‚Äù when he actually had taken most of his work from the unpublished works of Svabo to which he had access at the Royal Library in Copenhagen. * 1800‚Äì06 N√≥lsoyar P√°ll wrote ‚ÄúFuglakv√¶√∞i‚Äù, the anti-Danish and anticolonial ‚ÄúBird Ballad‚Äù. He was the first owner of a tradeship. Later he became a national hero, aided by his unexplained death at sea in 1808. He also wrote ballads like ‚ÄúKr√°kuteiti‚Äù (The Ballad of the Crowe) and \\"Eindadrongst√°ttur\\" (both before 1800, but the date is not known), \\"J√°kup √° M√∏n\\" (1800), \\"Greivin av Orient\\" and \\"Fr√∫ntat√°ttur\\" (1802‚Äì03), and \\"Gorpalandskv√¶√Ø og Kr√°kufr√∏√∞i\\" (1808). * 1807 Rasmus Rask writes a ‚ÄúF√¶r√∏sk Sprogl√¶re‚Äù, a thesis on Faroese. He prints this in Vejledning til det Islandske eller gamle Nordiske Sprog, published in 1811. * J√°kup Nols√∏e, the brother of N√≥lsoyar P√°ll, was central to creating a living social environment around the publication of Faroese antiquarian texts in the 1820s. He is mentioned and admired by Svend Grundtvig ‚Äú‚Ä¶at da en indf√∏dt F√¶ring, der er ansat ved Handelen deroppe, for nogle Aar siden, kun med Forandring i Udtalen, opl√¶ste islandske Sagaer (‚Ä¶) da str√∏mmede Indbyggerne til i stor M√¶ngde, ja kom endogsaa over fra andre √òer for at h√∏re, og gl√¶dede sig inderlig ved at lytte til de livlige Fort√¶llinger paa deres Modersmaal om deres Oldtidsfr√¶nder, hvis Minde for en Deel endnu levede iblandt dem. (Grundtvig, 1845, s. 73). He wrote F√¶r√∏sk Sprogl√¶re that never was published but was well known to Rasmus Rask, who later helped V.U. Hammersheimb to put together the first official Faroese orthography. * 1795‚Äì1864 Carl Christian Rafn was Danish and a very influential publisher and translator of old texts, working together with Icelandic and Faroese language activists. It was because of him, that the ‚ÄúF√¶reyingasaga‚Äù ‚Äì the Faroe Saga ‚Äì was published in 1832. He worked together with Rasmus Rask in translating The Faroe Saga to Danish. Rafn also formed the very influential Oldskriftselskabet in 1825. * P.E. M√ºller Danish theology professor at the University of Copenhagen, but better remembered for his work on philology and old Nordic literary history. He was the one to recognise the value the collection of ballads that H.C. Lyngbye made in the Faroe Islands in 1817. Later he wrote the introduction in the publication F√¶roiske Qv√¶der om Sigurd Fofnersbane og hans √Üt (1822). * Rasmus Rask was a world-famous Danish comparative language historian. He was interested in Icelandic from his youth and in 1816 he helped in forming the Icelandic Literary Union (Hi√∞ √≠slenska B√≥kmentaf√©lag) and in 1818 the Library in Reykjavik (later Landsb√≥kasafn Islands). He helped establish Literary Societies on London, Iceland and Copenhagen. His interest in Faroese inspired and helped in the creation of the written Faroese language of 1846. He helped Rafn in the translation of Faroe Saga. He was one of the leading inspirations behind the Faroese Library (Thorshavns L√¶sebibliothek ‚Äì Later F√¶ro Amts Bibliotek ‚Äì and even later Landsb√≥kasavni√∞) ‚Äì helping Davidsen with many gifts of books. * 1810 Jens Christian Djurhuus (1773‚Äì1853) (known as Sj√≥varb√≥ndin ‚Äì ‚Äúthe farmer at Sj√≥gv‚Äù), a farmer from Kollafjord in Streymoy wrote the modern and important ballad ‚ÄúOrmurin Langi‚Äù. He is also known for writing the ‚ÄúP√∫kalj√≥mur‚Äù (The Devils Ballad), a religious epic based on English poet John Milton's ‚ÄúParadise Lost‚Äù. * From around the year 1800 we see growing attention paid to the Farose ballads collected by Svabo, Lyngbye, Schr√∏ter, √≠ Kr√≥ki and later Hammersheimb. * 1814 Rasmus Rask publishes the first Faroese ballad. * 1817 H.C. Lyngbye prints the ballad ‚ÄúBr√≥kat√°ttur‚Äù by N√≥lsoyar P√°ll in Det Skandinaviske Litteraturselskabs Skrifter. * 1819 The Danish professor P.E. M√ºller gets 19 ballads sent from the Faroe Islands. He asked Peder Hentze, the priest of Sandoy, to collect ballads. Hentze gets J√≥hannes √≠ Kr√≥ki to do this. * 1822 The first Farose book is published: F√¶r√∂iske Qv√¶der Om Sigurd Fafnersbane of hans √Üt by H.C. Lyngbye in Randers, with 593 pages and an illustration of Tindholm and Dragasund. The book is dedicated to Her Royal Highness Queen Maria Sophia Frederika(?)\\". There is also a dedication to Anders S√∏rensen Vedel and Peter Syv. The book was published with a thesaurus and with some musical notes. Most of the ballads were written down by J.H. Schr√∏ter. * 1823 Johan Henrich Schr√∏ter translates and publishes the Gospel of Mathew in his own orthography: Evangelium Sankta Matth√¶ussa, aa F√∏risk o Dansk. Gjivi √ºt uppaa Prent e√§v tui Danska Buibils Selske√§binum (Randers, Elmenhoff, 1823). The book was republished in 1973, with a foreword and thesaurus by Prof. Chr. Matras. * 1820‚Äì40 The ballad selections Fugloyarb√≥k, Sandoyarb√≥k and Sandv√≠k are complete. Hammersheimb bought the Fugloyarb√≥k, Svend Grundtvig bought the Sandoyarb√≥k and gave it to the Royal Library. The Sandv√≠kar collection was lent to J√∏rgen Bloch. * 1826 Thorshavns L√¶sebibliothek Stiftes. * 1828 F√¶r√∏ernes Amts Bibliotek (National Library of the Faroe Islands). * 1832 Nordisk Tidsskrift for Oldkyndighed / udgivet af det Kongelige Nordiske Oldskrift-Selskab. * 1832 The publication of the F√¶r√∏ Saga: F√¶rey√≠nga Saga eller F√¶r√∏boernes Historie, i den islandske Grundtekst med f√¶r√∏isk og dansk overs√¶ttelse, udg. Af C.C. Rafn. Johan Henrich Schr√∏ter translated the text to Faroese. C.C. Rafn and Rasmus Rask made the Danish translation and also changed the Faroese translation. * 1836 M√©moires de la Soci√©t√© Royale des Antiquaires du Nord. In 1836 the Society began the publication of the Annaler, to contain contributions in Danish, Norwegian, Swedish or Icelandic, and the M√©moires, to contain translations of the principal works of the Society as well as occasional original contributions in French, English or German. It runs from 1836/1839-1850/1860; nouv. s√©r. 1866/1871-1932/1933, which would clearly cover the time period of the Aarb√∏ger, which was the continuation of the Annaler. [Harvard Univ. cat.] * 1840 Faroese ballands are published in Germany: Versuch einer geschichtlichen Charakteristik der Volkslider germanischer Nationen. Lpz. * 1840. (Dahl, Erik: Tyske, franske og engelske overs√¶ttelser af f√¶r√∏kv√¶der. Festtidskrift til Matras, 1970). * 1840 the Faroese medical doctor Napoleon Nols√∏e published Qv√§ab√≥k um fodna Manna Roisnir fr√• fisti Findartui. Irt i F√©reiun o goimt I Huanum √§t okkara d√∏vum. Skriva √∫r gomlum Bl√∏vum √§v Candidatus medicin√¶ & chirurgi√¶ N.Nols√∏e. Kjeibinhavn 1840. * 1789‚Äì1895 The Faroe Islands are the subject matter of many non-Danish travel writers and other expeditions. Primarily worth mentioning are The Stanley Expedition in 1789. It was a gentleman's expedition led by Sir John Stanley, his father being one of the richest men in England. At the age of 22, he set out to lead a scientific expedition to Iceland and the Faroe Islands (Wreight I: West, 1972). * 1815 George Stuart Mackenzie published A Short Account of the Faroe Isles, Drawn up for the Edinburg Encyclopedia. Danish publication in 1822, med anm√¶rkninger af bl.a. H.C. Lyngbye og Dr. Pfil. Forchhammer. * In the 19th century, a number of tourists and other travelers came to the Faroe Islands, and out of this there came a number of publications and examples of travel writing. One such author was the German Carl Julian Graba, who visited the Faroe Islands. In 1828 he published Reise nach F√§r√∂, first published in 1848, in: Fr. Heinzelman Reisen nach F√§r√∂, Island, Sibirien, und den Nord-polarl√§ndern, vol. 2, part.1 (64 s.). * Worth mentioning also is the account by the Frenchman Charles Fr√©d√©ric Martin of a voyage to the Faroes, published under the name: Essai sur la v√©g√©tation de l¬¥archipel des F√©r√∂e, compar√©e √† celles des Shetland et de I¬¥Islande meridionale, In: Voyages de la commission scientifique du nord, en Scandinavie, en Laponie, au Spitzberg, et af F√©r√∂e, pendant les ann√©es 1838, 1839, et 1840 sur la corvette la Recherche, command√©e par m. Fabvre, published by Paul Gaimard in 12 vol. from 1842‚Äì55. * In 1842 the anthology Chants populaires du Nord is published, containing five Faroese ballads. They were published by Xavier Marmier, who took part in the Admiral Paul Gaimard's expedition to the Faroes. * We could also mention George Clayton Atkinson's Journal of an Expedition to the Feroe and Westman Islands and Iceland 1833 and James Nicoll's An historical and descriptive account of Island, Greenland, and the Faroe Islands, with illustrations of their natural history. Edinburgh, 1860. * From 1883 to 1888 we find a number of French geographical investigations, as Jules Leclercq's La terre de glace: F√©roe ‚ÄìIslande: les geysers ‚Äì le mont Hekla (Paris, 1883) and from 1888: ‚ÄùL‚ÄôIslande et L‚Äôarchipel des F√¶raeer‚Äù by Dr. Henry Lebonne. * Of other more regular travel writing, where some have a relatively high quality, it is woth mentioning Elisabeth Taylors ‚ÄùThe Far Islands and Other Cold Places ‚Äì Travel Essays of a Victorian Lady‚Äù, she travelled in the Faroe Islands in 1895 (Taylor, 1997). * 1844 C.C. Rafn published both ‚ÄúAnnaler for nordisk Oldkyndighed‚Äù and Antiquarisk Tidskrift, that both publish Faroese contributions by fx Hammersheimb. * In these publications Hammersheimb publishes ballads and articles on language. * 1845 Povl Frederik Barfod, a true believer in Scandinavianism and a true antigerman spirit. He played a role in supporting Faroese Language and literature. He wrote two very intense articles in ‚ÄúF√¶drelandet‚Äù in 1845. His role is more of the agitator, than the philologist. He was also active in trying to form a Faroese Literary Society. (Frederik Barfod, et livs erindringer, 1897). * 1845 The invitation is sent out for ‚ÄúIndbydelse til stiftelse af et f√¶r√∏sk Selskab‚Äù signed by Frederik Barfod, A.P. Berggreen, FR. Hammerich, Fr. Helweg, Svend Grundtvig, V.U. Hammersheimb and the ielandic politician and philologist J√≥n Sigur√∞son m.fl. * 1845 N.M. Petersen, the first professor in Scandinavian languages at the University of Copenhagen, he stated that Faroese was not a real written language. * 1846 The Faroese written language find its final form through V.U. Hammersheimb. He is helped by a great number of philologists, such as Rasmus Rask (Rasmus Rask og f√¶r√∏sk, 1964). * 1846 The Danish medical doctor P.L. Panum published: ‚ÄùIagttagelser ‚Äì under M√¶slinge-Epidemien paa F√¶r√∏erne i Aaret 1846‚Äù.

IMDb He was born on 26 April 1962. Van Looy is also a popular television host in Flanders who hosts De Slimste Mens ter Wereld (The Smartest Person on Earth), and has hosted De Pappenheimers. The former is a television show aired on VIER where Van Looy and his team of comical judges are on a quest to find the world's smartest person, i.e., the one who has the best knowledge of politics, history, arts, sports, media and film.  Awards and recognition  His most famous films The Alzheimer Case and Loft have been widely appreciated by the Flemish audience as well as by the Flemish critics, with Loft even being the best watched Flemish movie in theaters up to now. Loft has got a Dutch remake in the Netherlands which was also a success. This resulted in an American remake which was again highly liked by the Flemish audience and critics, but not by the American critics. The reason for Loft not being a success in the United States will be a cultural difference between the United States and Flanders/Netherlands. As Erik Van Looy pointed out in Flanders/Netherlands cheating on someone (by a male or a female) is not considered to be such a big deal (as long as you still love your partner), where in the US it caused the main characters to become all very unlikable to the American audience.Erik Van Looy reageert op kritiek: \\"IJshockey kijken in plaats van vreemdgaan had misschien wel gewerkt\\".

Outpost Kaloki X is available for download from Xbox Live Arcade. The PC version for Microsoft Windows is called Outpost Kaloki (no X), and is available for download directly from NinjaBee. Gameplay In Outpost Kaloki X, players try to address the needs of visiting space voyagers, while simultaneously attempting to meet any special victory conditions for the current scenario. Players do this by analyzing the small supply and demand bars next to each of the five types of service buildings available, such as social or research. When a demand is largely unmet, it represents an opportunity to build a new structure of the appropriate type in order to satisfy that demand and earn money to provide further services. As the game progresses, players can build larger, more expensive structures which satisfy more customers at once with a higher quality of service. As with many economic simulations, the key challenge in Outpost Kaloki X involves striking the proper balance between capacity and supply as these change over time. Players must also quickly respond to unexpected events, such as meteor showers which may knock out certain facilities. Lastly, each scenario has unique requirements which must be fulfilled, such as satisfying the wants of a VIP by building a specific structure. Additionally, there are structures which do not generate money or fulfill the needs of visitors, but which instead are key to operating the station. The primary structure categories of this form are power generation (used to power everything else on the station), and maintenance (to prevent things from breaking down over time). In the War Story, there are also defensive structures which shoot down incoming attackers or meteors. Versions Notable differences between the Windows version and the Xbox 360 version include: * Enhanced graphics on the Xbox 360 version. * More than twice as many levels on the Xbox 360 release, including extra campaigns and scenarios. * The Xbox 360 version has a leaderboard and time challenges. The Xbox 360 version also initially contained a number of bugs which were corrected via an online update as of October 25, 2006. This included a bug which prevented 2 of the game's 12 achievements from being successfully completed, the gold medals in the later half of the Adventure Story, and the 8-port master achievement.

It is located in Adama, a city in the Oromia regional state of Ethiopia. History Adama Science and Technology University ( ASTU) was first established in 1993 as Nazareth Technical College (NTC), offering degree and diploma level education in technology fields. Later, the institution was renamed as Nazareth College of Technical Teacher Education (NCTTE), a self- explanatory label that describes what the institution used to train back then: candidates who would become technical teachers for TVET colleges/Schools across the country. In 2003, a new addition to NCTTE came about‚Äîintroduction of business education. Nonetheless, the new entries were solely meant for similar purposes: these graduates were also expected to help overcome the existing dearth of educators in vocational institutions. However, it was not until it was nominated by the Ministry of Education as Center of Excellence in Technology in 2008 that it opened various programs in applied engineering and technology. For its realization, it became a university modeled after the German paradigm: it not only became the only technical university in the nation, but also the only one led by a German professor. Following its renaming by the Council of Ministers as Adama Science and Technology University in May 2011, the university has started working towards the attainment of becoming a center of excellence in science and technology, thereby allowing for the realization of goals set in the Growth and Transformation Plan (GTP). To this end, a South Korean has been appointed as President of the University. Currently, ASTU is setting up a Research Park, in collaboration with stakeholders and other concerned bodies: one of a kind in the Ethiopian context. The university is also venturing out to the wider community and is currently engaged in various joint undertakings. \\"Background\\" www.astu.edu.et Retrieved June 10, 2016.

Other anglicisations include O‚ÄôFalvie, O‚ÄôFalvy, O‚ÄôFailie, O‚ÄôFalvey, Falvey, Fealy and Fealey. The O‚ÄôFalvey‚Äôs trace their descent to Conaire, who was King of Ireland at the beginning of the Christian era. The O‚ÄôFalvey‚Äôs are recorded to have been powerful chiefs of Corcu Duibne, specifically the Dingle Peninsula of modern-era County Kerry, the barony of Corcaguiny. They were also Lords of Inveragh during the tenth century, and the hereditary admirals of Desmond. The veracity of such claims is in their intent more than their detail, thus an \\"admiral\\" may well have been the leader of some boats, and a \\"lord\\" may have been a somewhat less imposing figure than a Victorian English nobleman. Some historical evidence appears to substantiate this particular claim, in the form of the following extract from The Viking Invasions of Ireland. :The second army was actually a navy consisting of the Ernans of Desmond led by their admiral Falvey the Fair (Falbi Fionn) ... When Sitric learned of the advancing army, he took his men aboard their ships and tied Callaghan to the mast. He then sailed out and waited for the Irish. The Irish fleet shot at the Vikings with all speed. Admiral Falvey attacked the lead Viking ship which carried Sitric and the tied Callaghan. Ramming the Viking vessel, he jumped aboard with two swords, one in each hand dueling the Viking warriors. Falvey cut loose Callaghan and together they fought their way out. As Callaghan escaped, Falvey was cut down and died aboard the Viking ship. Many men drowned in the battle as they were wearing such heavy armor. During the sea battle, the Cianachts and other Munstermen were forced to watch from the shore, unable to assist their navy. However, the Ernans destroyed the Vikings, sending them racing back to Norway. The stem is said to begin with High King Conaire C√≥em in 165 and ends with the entry, Thomas O‚ÄôFalvey of Taunton, Massachusetts with a son living in 1880. Documentation in Australia is also speculative, for example that of the \\"Falvey Family History\\". The O‚ÄôFalveys eventually were dispossessed of their titles and lands by the Anglo- Normans, and migrated to Clare and remained in the vicinity for centuries. In common with other formerly great Catholic and Gaelic families, they lived in the less accessible parts of Ireland, where they were apparently content to remain in obscurity until the Catholic Emancipation. Even after the upheaval of the Act for the Settlement of Ireland 1652 the O‚ÄôFalveys still held considerable lands around Cahersiveen, some of which remained in their hands in an unbroken succession until, in quite recent times, the property of this branch of the family passed by alliance to the Morrogh-Bernards. The Falvey lands that passed into the hands of the Morrogh-Bernard family are mentioned as a byline in a history of Presentation Monastery in Kerry in which the expansion of the teaching monastery was effected by acquisition of \\"five acres of Falvey‚Äôs Inch through the generosity of the Morrough-Bernard family\\" ... perhaps suggesting once extensive land holdingsas documented for example in the Presentation Monastery files. The 1982 family history goes on to say that \\"in the records from the Irish Birth Indexes of 1890, a total of seventeen entries appear for the name of Falvey, sixteen of which were in the counties of Cork, County Clare and Kerry. The name O‚ÄôFalvey was borne by at least fourteen of the Irish saints\\", but then Irish saints were not uncommon. Through the centuries, Falveys have featured in various historical entries, despite the relative rarity of the name. Other general historical references to Falveys may be found around the time of the Norman Conquest of England, for which time the Ireland History in Maps shows the Ua Failbe, that is O‚ÄôFalvey family, as a Lesser Sept located in the south west peninsula that forms part of Kerry. On the map for the pre-Norman period circa 1100, they are similarly listed in that location as a lesser dynastic surname. A footnote (number 10) in an extract from a history of Desmond implies the competition that Falveys lived with to maintain influence in the region. The 1540-1713 period of the Irish confessors and martyrs has produced a list of those who suffered under the Irish penal enactments from 1537 according to an inquiry held in Dublin, which among gruesome descriptions of hangings and being cut to pieces, includes one Donchus O‚ÄôFalvey, a priest that is perhaps the Daniel Falvey, friar, remanded at Kerry Lent Assizes, 1703. By the late seventeenth century, records of officers in King James' army include at least four Falvey‚Äôs, a Captain Denis Falvey, two lieutenants Falvey, one of which was named Dermott, and an ensign Hugh Falvey. The entry for Falvey families in Kerry, implies an interesting history that must have been common to many families. While it includes a chief, a grant to use English law and a later repeal of the grant, distinguished death in battle, and a Counsellor of apparent note, it also contains many names without note and a lowly tanner. While it may be tempting to ignore the ignominious and to claim the Falvey crown and heritage, most were apparently peasants. Surnames in the sense we understand them today were introduced in Ireland from about the tenth century, and are known to have been commonplace by the twelfth. This event alone would not have assisted genealogical research, but as the Irish system of inheritance of name and land was patronymic, some names appear in older records. The \\"O\\" in O‚ÄôFalvey was simply the English expression of the Gaelic ‚Äòua‚Äô meaning ‚Äòfrom‚Äô, and seems to have been dropped from many Irish names during times of persecution. Considering the integration of the Falveys with the Anglo-Saxon and Protestant culture of the modern West, and the benefits they enjoy from such integration as for many others, the ancestral shedding of the ‚ÄòO‚Äô might now seem to have been prescient. Today, the name Falvey seems rare. However, the variants of anglicised spellings of the name means that for a Falvey, in addition to the obvious alternative spellings and retention of prefix ‚ÄòO‚Äô, families bearing such names as Fallie, Fealy and Fealey may be as closely related as any unknown Falvey. Family Heritage International offers estimates of the Falvey population in the USA, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Great Britain and Northern Ireland, although as their listing of Falvey addresses is inevitably deficient. For Australia, search results of the National Archives of Ireland includes 11 Falveys for the years 1836-1856, eight of whom were transported for such crimes as stealing a cow or other larceny. The destination of transportees is not noted. The main campus library at Villanova University is named Falvey Memorial Library, in remembrance of Rev. Daniel Falvey, an Augustinian priest who dedicated over half his life as librarian for the university.http://library.villanova.edu/About References Lindsay Falvey, (2003). Falvey Family History.

The Market Square (, ) is a city square in the city of Turku, in Finland. It is located in the city's VI District, and is generally considered the city's central square. It hosts a lively market on weekdays, and there are several caf√©s and restaurants on the square. The buildings around the Market Square are also part of the city's central business district. They include, for instance, the Hansa and Forum shopping centres, the Wiklund department store, an Orthodox church, a private medical clinic, and several instances of media such as an office of Finland's major newspaper Helsingin Sanomat, locally most significant newspaper Turun Sanomat and Yle. Centre for local buses Two of the four streets around the rectangular square, Aurakatu/Auragatan (to the west) and Eerikinkatu/Eriksgatan (to the south), are barred from all traffic other than the city's public transport buses and taxis. The square is somewhat of a public transport hub: there are 14 bus stops around the square and the majority of local and regional buses in Turku stop there. There is also a taxi rank on the north side of the square, on Yliopistonkatu/Universitetsgatan, which is also reserved for taxis only between midnight and 06:00. Future plans Turku's city council is currently discussing plans to build a two- storey car park under the square, with spaces for 600 cars in order to help with perceived parking problems in the city centre, which are not confirmed to be existing in any research or numbers. The construction scheme would possibly include turning Yliopistonkatu/Universitetsgatan and Aurakatu/Auragatan into pedestrian streets and moving the bus stops to Kauppiaskatu/K√∂pmansgatan on the east side of the square, which would be restricted for public transport only. Critics have argued that the planned parking complex would increase pollution in the city centre and create disturbance in the lengthy construction stage. Many people also see it as unnecessary, since there are already many such complexes in the city centre. In the 2008, names of 13,000 citizens of Turku was collected in street survey for having a referendum. Photo gallery File:Hansakortteli.JPGPart of the market square and the Hansa shopping centre.

Formerly a Member of Salford City Council, at the 1945 general election he was elected as Member of Parliament for Manchester Hulme. When that constituency was abolished for the 1950 general election, he was elected for the Newton constituency in Lancashire, and sat for that constituency until retiring from Parliament at the February 1974 general election. In 1960, on the death of Aneurin Bevan, he stood as a left- wing candidate for Labour's Deputy Leadership against George Brown and James Callaghan. After Callaghan had been eliminated, Lee was defeated by Brown by 146 votes to 83. He was Parliamentary Private Secretary to the Chancellor of the Exchequer from 1948, and held Ministerial office as Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Labour and National Service from 1950‚Äì51, Minister of Power from 1964 to 1966, the last Secretary of State for the Colonies in 1966, and Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster from 1967 to 1969.

Survivalists, campers, hikers and other outdoors groups have found it to be indispensable in field use. Modern entrenching tools are usually collapsible and made using steel, aluminum, or other light metals.  History and development  Entrenching tools go back at least to the times of the Roman Legion who used a type of mattock known as a Dolabra. Julius Caesar, as well as other ancient writers, documented the use of spades and other digging implements as important tools of war. The Roman Legion when on the march would dig a ditch and rampart fortified with mobile stakes around their camps every night where established camps were not available. Siege tactics throughout history required the digging of fortifications and often mining of walls was attempted, where saps were dug to a wall‚Äôs foundation, and collapsing the wall was attempted. In more modern times the siege tactics of the Napoleonic Wars used spades and pickaxes as entrenching tools to dig trenches towards the walls of the fortifications being besieged, to allow men and munitions to get close enough to fire cannons at the walls to open a breach. Being too long and heavy to be transported by individual soldiers, entrenching shovels and spades were normally carried in the supply carts (logistics train) of a military column; only pioneer or engineer troops typically carried spades or shovels as part of their individual equipment. This frequently led to situations in which the infantry did not have access to entrenching equipment when it was needed.Belknap, William W., Trowel-Bayonet: Letter from the Secretary of War In Answer to a Resolution of the House of April 4, 1872, The Executive Documents of the House of Representative, 42nd Congress, 2nd Session (1871‚Äì1872), Washington, D.C.: U.S. Government Printing Office (1872), pp. 1-20 As one U.S. army infantry officer noted, \\"the intrenching tools of an army rarely get up to the front until the exigency for their use has passed.\\"  Trowel bayonet  U.S. Bayonet Model 1873 Trowel In 1870, the U.S. Army introduced the trowel bayonet, intended for individual soldiers as both a weapon and an entrenching tool.Ripley, George, and Dana, Charles A., The American Cyclopaedia: A Popular Dictionary of General Knowledge (Vol. II), New York: D.

Modern era Linnemann shovel from WWI (Romania) Russian MPL-50 ( ‚Äì small infantry spade) are similar to the entrenching tools used by most armies participating in those conflicts. The first truly modern entrenching tool was invented in 1869 by the Danish officer Mads Johan Buch Linnemann. In 1870, it was patented and supplied to the Danish Army. The next year it was adopted by the much bigger Austrian Army, and Linnemann founded a factory in Vienna to produce his spade. It was later introduced to Germany, France, Romania and Russia, though only Russia recognized Linnemann's patent rights, and paid him 30,000 rubles and ordered 60,000 spades.Nieuwenhuis, Peder (1887‚Äì1905) \\"Johan Linnemann\\", in C.F. Bricka (ed.) Dansk Biografisk Lexikon, Copenhagen: Gyldendal.

During World War I entrenching tools became extremely important with the introduction of trench warfare. Entrenching tools designed for the individual infantryman soon appeared with short straight handles, T-handles, D-handles, and other designs. The British entrenching tool of this period was a two part design, with a metal head and a wooden handle, the metal head consisted of an adze/spade blade and a pick spike, used alone the head could be used as a spade with the pick spike serving as a handle. Between the blade and the spike was a ring into which the handle could be inserted at right angles to the head, with the handle inserted the tool could be used as a pick mattock. Besides being used for digging defensive fighting positions, entrenching tools were used for digging latrines and graves. During World War I, the entrenching spade was also pressed into service as a melee weapon. In the close confines of a trench, rifles and fixed bayonets were often too long for effective use, and entrenching tools were often used as auxiliary arms for close-quarter fighting.Beith, Ian H. (Capt.), Modern Battle Tactics: Address Delivered April 9, 1917, National Service (June 1917), pp. 325, 328 (In Nancy Mitford's 1945 novel, The Pursuit of Love, there hangs over the chimney-piece an entrenching tool \\"with which, in 1915, Uncle Matthew had whacked to death eight Germans one by one as they crawled out of a dug-out. It is still covered with blood and hairs, an object of fascination to us as children.\\") From 1915, soldiers on both sides routinely sharpened the edges of entrenching shovels for use as weapons.  World War II folding designs  The World War II era German folding spade would set the trend for all future designs M8A1 Scabbard, carrying M6 bayonet, attached. \\"In 1938, the (German) foldable spade, appeared, being the precursor of all modern spades of this kind, including the 1943 American copy.\\"Deutsche Soldaten: Uniforms, Equipment and Personal Effects of the German 1935‚Äì45. by Agustin Saiz. Casemate Publishers. 2008. page 146 Folding designs became increasingly popular, usually consisting of a fixed handle with a folding shovel head, and sometimes incorporating a pick into the design. Like all individual entrenching tools, they were designed to be easily carried as part of an infantry soldier's standard pack equipment. The British 1937 Pattern entrenching tool added a bayonet lug to the tool's handle, allowing the Lee-Enfield spike bayonet to be mounted on the end and converting the tool into a mine prodder.Storey, W. E. 1937 Web Service Publications 2006 Entrenching tools, if strongly built, can also be used as ancillary weapons. Some entrenching tools can be even sharpened on one or both sides of the blade to be used as cutting tools or weapons; in fact, when used as such, the tool's sharp, thick edges are strong enough to cut through flesh and bone. During the Second World War, entrenchment tools were used in close quarters combat between German and Soviet forces, notably in the brutal hand- to-hand fighting during the Battle of Stalingrad.  Contemporary  Modern all steel tri-folding E-Tool with D-handle The United States Army intrenching tool has evolved since the time of the Pattern 1907 non-folding T-handled spade Cole, David, Survey of U.S. Army Uniforms, Weapons and Accoutrements, U.S. Army Center of Military History, 2007, p. 64 to a tri-fold design with a modified ‚ÄúD‚Äù handle design with all steel construction, to a similar light weight plastic and steel tri-fold design adopted by NATO as the standard issue intrenching tool. Other folding variants have also been issued. The latest light weight plastic tri-fold design is thirty percent lighter than the all- steel tri-fold was: instead of . Glock Feldspaten entrenching tool. Note: plastic telescoping handle and saw blade The Glock Feldspaten (field spade) features a hardened metal spade blade that can be locked in 3 positions for digging, shoveling, and chopping, and a telescopic handle made out of fiberglass-reinforced nylon containing a long hardened metal sawblade. The entrenching tool weighs and fully extended is long. The spade and handle can be collapsed and shortened for easy transport and storage into a 260 mm √ó 150 mm √ó 60 mm (10 in √ó 6 in √ó in) package.Glock entrenching tool Soviet Spetsnaz units were well trained in the use of the standard short-handled Russian entrenching shovel (\\"saperka\\") as a weapon; by the nature of their missions, such tools were only rarely used for digging or entrenching positions. Modern commando forces, too, are trained to fight with entrenchment tools.  Civilian use  Many millions of surplus entrenching tools have made their way into the hands of civilians. They are commonly used for camping, gardening and by war re-enactment groups. Some people collect the older issue entrenching tools as military memorabilia.

It had excellent accuracy, penetration and range, but its size made transportation difficult. It was nicknamed \\"Norsupyssy\\" (\\"Elephant Gun\\"), and as tanks developed armour too thick for the Lahti to penetrate, its uses switched to long range sniping, tank harassment and with the L-39/44 fully automatic variant, employment as an improvised anti-aircraft weapon.  Development  Aimo Lahti had doubts about the original idea of a 13 mm anti- tank machine gun and started working on a 20 mm design. Officers who wanted smaller calibre anti-tank weapons believed that the muzzle velocity of 20 mm shells was insufficient to penetrate armour and a weapon with a higher rate of fire and in a smaller calibre would prove useful. As a result, Lahti designed two competing anti-tank weapons: a 13.2 mm machine gun and a 20 mm rifle. After test firing both weapons in 1939, they found that the 20 mm rifle achieved better penetration. Operation The rifle is a semi-automatic, gas operated weapon with the piston located beneath the barrel and ammunition feed from detachable top-mounted magazine with bottom ejection for the spent cartridges. To reduce recoil, the rifle is equipped with a five-hole muzzle brake and a padded leather recoil pad. The barrel has a wooden jacket to allow transportation after firing has caused the barrel to heat up.  Usage = Winter War  During the Winter War (1939‚Äì1940) Finland lacked anti-tank weaponry. Only two 20 mm rifles and a few 13.2 mm machine guns made it to the front, where the 13.2 mm machine guns were found to be ineffective and unreliable while the larger 20 mm rifles proved successful against Soviet armour. Because of this, Finland finally settled on the 20 mm design and started production. The gun was also widely used in the Cold Charlie counter- sniper technique, where the Finns would use a mannequin posing as an officer sloppily covering himself. Soviet snipers would fire upon the mannequin, and the Finns would then return fire at the Soviet snipers with the Lahti L-39.  Continuation War  An L-39 being used as an improvised anti-aircraft weapon in 1942 The Continuation War (, , 25 June 1941 ‚Äì 19 September 1944) was the second of two wars fought between Finland and the Soviet Union during World War II. Although the weapon was not able to penetrate newer Soviet tanks like the T-34 and KV-1, it still proved to be quite effective against bunker loopholes/embrasures, long range targets, and even aircraft. A fully automatic version of the L39 was made in small numbers that served as an anti-aircraft gun. Other good targets were snipers, and several weak spots on tanks, such as open top hatches, especially with phosphorus ammunition. It was even able to damage tank turrets and pin them to stop traversal of the cannon. Around December 1940, a Lahti L-39 replaced the original 13.2 mm L-35/36 machine gun on the single Finnish L-182 armored car. This conversion was employed by the armored unit of 1. Divisioona () during 1941.  After World War II  Several of the rifles remained in service after World War II serving as an anti-helicopter weapon, while many others were sold to collectors, mostly in the United States. Today the rifles, especially those in working condition, are quite rare and highly sought after. Some deactivated weapons (with a steel bar welded into the chamber) have been reactivated due to their value. Ammunition is rare. Often they are rechambered to .50 BMG to lower the cost of use. In the United States, civilian ownership remains possible, depending on state and federal laws. Because the weapon fires rounds larger than .50 calibre, it is considered a destructive device and is subject to the 1934 National Firearms Act. Civilian ownership is dependent on compliance with this law and whether the individual state prohibits civilian ownership of destructive devices. Details of use Users found the L-39 to be heavy and difficult to move in the battlefield. Even its magazine weighed almost two kilograms. The magazines had a covered viewing slit on the right side to indicate the number of rounds left in the magazine, and a 15-round magazine was later developed for anti-aircraft use. To combat the L-39's immense recoil, the recoil spring was so stiff that it would be impossible to cock the weapon with a traditional charging handle. Instead, a rotating crank lever on the right side of the gun is used to pull the bolt back. While semi-automatic in function, the L-39's bolt locks back after every shot, and the grip safety also functions to release the bolt. The entire front of the grip and trigger is protected by a large guard and a rubber buffer to protect the operator's hands from the spent casings which eject from the bottom of the gun at very high speeds. The whole weapon weighed some 50 kilograms and it was usually towed by horses, but when stripped down could be carried by several men. The rifle had adjustable iron sights calibrated between 200 and 1,400 meters and was equipped with unusual dual bipod, with two sets of legs, one with spikes for use on hard ground and the other with skids for use on softer ground or snow. In the field, a two-man team was assigned to the gun to move and fire it. Some rifles were abandoned in the heat of battle, but they were easy to replace. By the end of the war over 1900 L39s had been manufactured by VKT (Valtion Kiv√§√§ritehdas, \\"State Rifle Factory\\", modern day Patria) and put in the field.

It developed through translations of Buddhist scripture into Chinese. It is a response to the universals of the experience of translation and to the specifics of the experience of translating from specific source languages into Chinese. It also developed in the context of Chinese literary and intellectual tradition. The Modern Standard Chinese word fanyi ÁøªË≠Ø \\"translate; translation\\" compounds fan \\"turn over; cross over; translate\\" and yi \\"translate; interpret\\". Some related synonyms are tongyi ÈÄöË≠Ø \\"interpret; translate\\", chuanyi ÂÇ≥Ë≠Ø \\"interpret; translate\\", and zhuanyi ËΩâË≠Ø \\"translate; retranslate\\". The Chinese classics contain various words meaning \\"interpreter; translator\\", for instance, sheren Ëàå‰∫∫ (lit. \\"tongue person\\") and fanshe ÂèçËàå (lit. \\"return tongue\\").

James Legge 1885 Sacred Books of > the East vol. 27, pp. 229‚Äì230 A Western Han work attributes a dialogue about translation to Confucius. Confucius advises a ruler who wishes to learn foreign languages not to bother. Confucius tells the ruler to focus on governance and let the translators handle translation. The earliest bit of translation theory may be the phrase \\"names should follow their bearers, while things should follow China.\\" In other words, names should be transliterated, while things should be translated by meaning. In the late Qing Dynasty and the Republican Period, reformers such as Liang Qichao, Hu Shih and Zhou Zuoren began looking at translation practice and theory of the great translators in Chinese history. Zhi Qian (3rd century AD) Zhi Qian (ÊîØË¨ô)'s preface (Â∫è) is the first work whose purpose is to express an opinion about translation practice. The preface was included in a work of the Liang Dynasty. It recounts an historical anecdote of 224 AD, at the beginning of the Three Kingdoms period. A party of Buddhist monks came to Wuchang. One of them, Zhu Jiangyan by name, was asked to translate some passage from scripture. He did so, in rough Chinese. When Zhi Qian questioned the lack of elegance, another monk, named Vighna (Á∂≠Ë°πÈöæ), responded that the meaning of the Buddha should be translated simply, without loss, in an easy- to-understand manner: literary adornment is unnecessary. All present concurred and quoted two traditional maxims: Laozi's \\"beautiful words are untrue, true words are not beautiful\\" and Confucius's \\"speech cannot be fully recorded by writing, and speech cannot fully capture meaning\\". Zhi Qian's own translations of Buddhist texts are elegant and literary, so the \\"direct translation\\" advocated in the anecdote is likely Vighna's position, not Zhi Qian's. Dao An (314 ‚Äì 385 AD) Dao An focused on loss in translation. His theory is the Five Forms of Loss (‰∫îÂ§±Êú¨): # Changing the word order. Sanskrit word order is free with a tendency to SOV. Chinese is SVO. # Adding literary embellishment where the original is in plain style. # Eliminating repetitiveness in argumentation and panegyric (È†åÊñá). # Cutting the concluding summary section (Áæ©Ë™™). # Cutting the recapitulative material in introductory section. Dao An criticized other translators for loss in translation, asking: how would they feel if a translator cut out the boring parts of classics like the Shi Jing or the Classic of History? He also expanded upon the difficulty of translation, with his theory of the Three Difficulties (‰∏â‰∏çÊòì): # Communicating the Dharma to a different audience from the one the Buddha addressed. # Translating the words of a saint. # Translating texts which have been painstakingly composed by generations of disciples. Kumarajiva (344 ‚Äì 413 AD) Kumarajiva‚Äôs translation practice was to translate for meaning. The story goes that one day Kumarajiva criticized his disciple Sengrui for translating ‚Äúheaven sees man, and man sees heaven‚Äù (Â§©Ë¶ã‰∫∫,‰∫∫Ë¶ãÂ§©). Kumarajiva felt that ‚Äúman and heaven connect, the two able to see each other‚Äù (‰∫∫Â§©‰∫§Êé•,ÂÖ©ÂæóÁõ∏Ë¶ã) would be more idiomatic, though heaven sees man, man sees heaven is perfectly idiomatic. In another tale, Kumarajiva discusses the problem of translating incantations at the end of sutras. In the original there is attention to aesthetics, but the sense of beauty and the literary form (dependent on the particularities of Sanskrit) are lost in translation. It is like chewing up rice and feeding it to people (ÂöºÈ£ØËàá‰∫∫). Huiyuan (334 ‚Äì 416 AD) Huiyuan's theory of translation is middling, in a positive sense. It is a synthesis that avoids extremes of elegant (ÊñáÈõÖ) and plain (Ë≥™Ê®∏). With elegant translation, \\"the language goes beyond the meaning\\" (ÊñáÈÅéÂÖ∂ÊÑè) of the original. With plain translation, \\"the thought surpasses the wording\\" (ÁêÜÂãùÂÖ∂Ëæ≠). For Huiyuan, \\"the words should not harm the meaning\\" (Êñá‰∏çÂÆ≥ÊÑè). A good translator should ‚Äústrive to preserve the original‚Äù (ÂãôÂ≠òÂÖ∂Êú¨). Sengrui (371 ‚Äì 438 AD) Sengrui investigated problems in translating the names of things. This is of course an important traditional concern whose locus classicus is the Confucian exhortation to ‚Äúrectify names‚Äù (Ê≠£Âêç). This is not merely of academic concern to Sengrui, for poor translation imperils Buddhism. Sengrui was critical of his teacher Kumarajiva's casual approach to translating names, attributing it to Kumarajiva's lack of familiarity with the Chinese tradition of linking names to essences (ÂêçÂØ¶). Sengyou (445 ‚Äì 518 AD) Much of the early material of earlier translators was gathered by Sengyou and would have been lost but for him. Sengyou‚Äôs approach to translation resembles Huiyuan's, in that both saw good translation as the middle way between elegance and plainness. However, unlike Huiyuan, Sengyou expressed admiration for Kumarajiva‚Äôs elegant translations. Xuanzang (600 ‚Äì 664 AD) Xuanzang‚Äôs theory is the Five Untranslatables (‰∫îÁ®Æ‰∏çÁøª), or five instances where one should transliterate: # Secrets: DhƒÅra·πáƒ´ ÈôÄÁæÖÂ∞º, Sanskrit ritual speech or incantations, which includes mantras. # Polysemy: Bhagavant ËñÑ‰ºΩÊ¢µ, which means sovereignty, ablaze, solemnity, fame, auspicious, esteemed.„Ää‰ΩõÂú∞Á∂ìË´ñ„ÄãÂç∑1Ôºö„ÄåÂ¶ÇÊòØ‰∏ÄÂàáÂ¶Ç‰æÜÂÖ∑ÊúâÊñº‰∏ÄÂàáÁ®ÆÁöÜ‰∏çÁõ∏Èõ¢ÔºåÊòØÊïÖÂ¶Ç‰æÜÂêçËñÑ‰ºΩÊ¢µ„ÄÇÂÖ∂Áæ©‰∫ë‰ΩïÔºüË¨ÇË´∏Â¶Ç‰æÜÊ∞∏‰∏çÁπ´Â±¨Ë´∏ÁÖ©ÊÉ±ÊïÖÔºåÂÖ∑Ëá™Âú®Áæ©„ÄÇÁÑ∞ÁåõÊô∫ÁÅ´ÊâÄÁáíÁÖâÊïÖÔºåÂÖ∑ÁÜæÁõõÁæ©„ÄÇÂ¶ô‰∏âÂçÅ‰∫åÂ§ßÂ£´Áõ∏Á≠âÊâÄËéäÈ£æÊïÖÔºåÂÖ∑Á´ØÂö¥Áæ©„ÄÇ‰∏ÄÂàáÊÆäÂãùÂäüÂæ∑ÂúìÊªøÁÑ°‰∏çÁü•ÊïÖÔºåÂÖ∑ÂêçÁ®±Áæ©„ÄÇ‰∏ÄÂàá‰∏ñÈñìË¶™Ëøë‰æõÈ§äÂí∏Á®±ËÆöÊïÖÔºåÂÖ∑ÂêâÁ••Áæ©„ÄÇÂÖ∑‰∏ÄÂàáÂæ∑Â∏∏Ëµ∑Êñπ‰æøÂà©ÁõäÔºåÂÆâÊ®Ç‰∏ÄÂàáÊúâÊÉÖÁÑ°ÊáàÂª¢ÊïÖÔºåÂÖ∑Â∞äË≤¥Áæ©„ÄÇ„Äç(T26, no. 1530, 292a29-b7) # None in China: jambu tree ÈñªÊµÆÊ®π, which does not grow in China. # Deference to the past: the translation for anuttara-samyak-sa·πÉbodhi is already established as Anouputi ÈòøËÄ®Ëè©Êèê. # To inspire respect and righteousness: Praj√±ƒÅ Ëà¨Ëã• instead of ‚Äúwisdom‚Äù (Êô∫ÊÖß). Daoxuan (596 ‚Äì 667 AD)Yan Fu (1898) Yan Fu is famous for his three-facet theory of translation; namely, faithfulness (‰ø° x√¨n), be true to the original in spirit; expressiveness (ÈÅî d√°), be accessible to the target reader; and elegance (ÈõÖ y«é), be in the language the target reader accepts as being educated. Of the three facets, the first is the most important one. If the meaning of the translated text is not accessible to the reader, there is no difference between having translated the text and not having translated the text at all. In order to facilitate comprehension, word order should be changed, Chinese examples may replace original ones, and even people's names should be rendered Chinese. Yan Fu's theory of translation is based on his experience with translating works of social sciences from English into Chinese. The typical misapplication of the theory is to extend it to the translation of literary works. The two typical misinterpretations of the theory are: (a) interpreting accessibility as clarity or expressiveness, (b) overgeneralizing Yan Fu's specific readership to general readership. According to Yan Fu, good translation is one that is true to the original in spirit, accessible to the target reader in meaning, and attractive to the target reader in style. Liang Qichao (1920) Liang Qichao put these three qualities of a translation in the same order, fidelity first, then clarity, and only then elegance. Lin Yutang (1933) Lin Yutang stressed the responsibility of the translator to the original, to the reader, and to art. To fulfill this responsibility, the translator needs to meet standards of fidelity (Âø†ÂØ¶), smoothness (ÈÄöÈ†Ü) and beauty. Lu Xun (1935) Lu Xun's most famous dictum relating to translation is \\"I'd rather be faithful than smooth\\" (ÂØß‰ø°ËÄå‰∏çÈ†Ü). Ai Siqi (1937) Ai Siqi described the relationships between fidelity, clarity and elegance in terms of Western ontology, where clarity and elegance are to fidelity as qualities are to being. Zhou Zuoren (1944) Zhou Zuoren assigned weightings, 50% of translation is fidelity, 30% is clarity, and 20% elegance. Zhu Guangqian (1944) Zhu Guangqian wrote that fidelity in translation is the root which you can strive to approach but never reach. This formulation perhaps invokes the traditional idea of returning to the root in Daoist philosophy. Fu Lei (1951) Fu Lei held that translation is like painting: what is essential is not formal resemblance but rather spiritual resemblance (Á•û‰ºº). Qian Zhongshu (1964) Qian Zhongshu wrote that the highest standard of translation is transformation (Âåñ, the power of transformation in nature): bodies are sloughed off, but the spirit (Á≤æÁ•û), appearance and manner (ÂßøËá¥) are the same as before (ÊïÖÊàë), the old me or the old self).

The Night the Bettors Mutinied at Yonkers. July 12, 1971. New York Magazine.pg.44-46 Biography=Operating in Harlem Tramunti was born October 1, 1910, in Naples and arrived in U.S. with father Luigi, mother Rosa DeRosa and sister Ermiland that settled in Manhattan and raised in a tenement on 107th Street in Harlem. He eventually ran the \\"Harlem Game\\", one of the major floating craps games in New York. Tramunti was a beefy man who stood , had a triple chin, and bore a remarkable resemblance to comedian Jonathan Winters. Tramunti's headquarters was The Stage Delicatessen in Manhattan. Tramunti lived in Whitestone, Queens and had a wife and two children. One of Tramunti's sons, Louis, died at age 14. In 1922, the 12-year- old Tramunti was sent to a Catholic reform school due to truancy from school. On December 9, 1930, Tramunti was arrested on charges of robbing a rent collector. However, on December 26, a judge dismissed the charges due to lack of evidence. In July 1931, Tramunti was convicted of felonious assault and was sentenced to six to fifteen years at the Sing Sing Correctional Facility in Ossining, New York. He was paroled in 1937, then returned to prison for a violation. Boss of Lucchese family In 1967, with the death of Lucchese boss Tommy Lucchese, Tramunti became the official boss of the Lucchese family. Carlo Gambino, the head of the Gambino crime family, allegedly used his influence to make Tramunti the Lucchese boss. Other sources said that Tramunti was a compromise candidate who was acceptable to the different family factions. A common version is that the Mafia Commission designated Tramunti as temporary boss until Lucchese's preferred successor, Anthony \\"Tony Ducks\\" Corallo, was released from prison On November 19, 1970, Tramunti was indicted in Florida on 14 counts of stock fraud and other charges. The government charged that Tramunti and other mobsters forcibly seized control of a Miami investment firm. On December 23, 1971, Tramunti was acquitted of all charges in the stock swindle case. On November 29, 1972, Tramunti was indicted on criminal contempt charges for lying to a grand jury about calls he made to capo Paul Vario. Tramunti was convicted and sentenced on August 6, 1973, to three years in state prison. French Connection conviction On October 4, 1973, as a result of \\"Operation Shamrock\\" (now known as the French Connection Case), Tramunti and 43 other mobsters were indicted on narcotics trafficking charges. Ultimately, Tramunti was convicted in the famous French Connection case for financing a huge heroin smuggling operation. A former steward at an espresso cafe testified to hearing drug dealer Louis Inglese discuss a deal with Tramunti and seeing Tramunti nod his head in approval. Some observers felt the case was a miscarriage of justice, including crime reporters Jack Newfield and Murray Kempton. Tramunti always denied the charges, stating \\"I may be a mobster and may have done bad things but I am not a drug dealer\\". On May 7, 1974, Tramunti was sentenced to 15 years in federal prison, the judge stating that he was \\"dangerous.\\" Anthony \\"Tony Ducks\\" Corallo succeeded Tramunti as head of the Lucchese family. Death On October 15, 1978, Carmine Tramunti died of natural causes in prison. He is buried in Calvary Cemetery, Queens.Carmine Tramunti Find A Grave In popular culture *Tramunti‚Äôs conviction in the French Connection case is referenced in the 1990 movie, Goodfellas. In the movie, mob boss Paul Cicero (based on the real life counterpart Paul Vario) warns the main character Henry Hill against drug dealing, and references \\"Gribbs\\" as an example. *Tramunti may have been the inspiration for the Mafia character Dominic Cattano, played by the Sicilian- American actor Armand Assante, in the 2007 motion picture American Gangster.

It represents many motor brands, and is based in Altrincham. It is listed on the London Stock Exchange. History Lookers in Burnley (2009) The Lookers Group was established in 1908, by John Looker. It was based in Manchester, and dealt with the sale of bicycles, parts, accessories. In 1910, the business joined forces, to create Lookers Ltd. Until World War I, Lookers Ltd was primarily a Ford dealer, which thrived to such an extent. In 1911, the garage in Hardman Street had to be completely rebuilt, to accommodate the business generated by Ford. In 1918, the business was appointed a distributor of Austin Motor Company. It continued to grow throughout Lancashire and Cheshire, through the acquisition of a number of garages. Lookers and Austin became very closely associated such that the slogan \\"Lookers is Austin\\" lasted for many years. The business continued to prosper until World War II, in 1939. In 1973, the group's headquarters were transferred to Chester Road in Timperley and the company became a listed company on the London Stock Exchange. Issuing shares on the stock exchange created extra funds, which then enabled the company to take its first major steps towards expansion. Lookers strengthened its Vauxhall dealerships, with the acquisition of Braid Group, a major dealership group based in Liverpool, for ¬£3 million. The purchase was completed in 1983. By December 1984, the first full year including Braid, the company's sales topped ¬£150 million. In 1989, Lookers acquired SMAC Continental, based in South East England, for ¬£14.7 million. That purchase also added SMAC's dealerships of Mercedes-Benz to Lookers portfolio of manufacturers. In February 1996, Lookers bought Charles Hurst Group, a dealership in Northern Ireland. Meanwhile, Lookers began an investment program, which included the opening of a ¬£4.5 million dealership in Stretford in 1999, for sales of Suzuki, SEAT and Mazda. Investments totalling ¬£20 million, in order to open new showrooms in Chester, Liverpool, and Oldham in 2001. The company added a number of existing dealerships as well, such as 452 Birmingham and Spekehall Vauxhall, bought from Vauxhall and Rystar Aston and Selly Oak Vauxhall, bought from Ryland Group. In August 2002, Lookers further strengthened its Vauxhall network, with the purchase of Elt Brothers, based in Birmingham, for ¬£900,000. In May 2002, Lookers teamed up with Morrisons, in an experiment to sell cars from Internet displays in three supermarkets of Morrisons. By 2003, Lookers' network of dealerships had topped 90. The company had built up an extensive network, throughout the United Kingdom. In February 2003, Lookers completed its United Kingdom presence, with a move into Scotland. Through Hurst, it acquired JN Holdings, better known as the operator of Taggarts Motor Group in Glasgow and Motherwell. In August 2004, Lookers made another significant acquisition, this time boosting its presence in the United Kingdom aftermarket car parts circuit, when it bought FPS Distribution. Other dealerships acquired through December 2004 included Savoy Honda in Warrington; Vauxhall dealerships in Lisburn and Portadown; Darlington Volkswagen; another Volkswagen dealership in Northallerton; and one dealership of Saab in Chester. In February 2005, Lookers added a used car \\"supermarket\\" Bristol Trade Center, paying ¬£8.5 million. In December 2005, Lookers made a bid for larger rival Reg Vardy. However, Pendragon PLC offered a counter bid, which succeeded after Lookers decided it could not raise its bid. During the bidding battle for Reg Vardy, Pendragon made an unsuccessful hostile bid for Lookers. In October 2007, Lookers acquired Dutton Forshaw, another dealership, from Lloyds TSB for ¬£60 million. The company went on to buy Lomond Audi Group in July 2012, Shields Motors, and opened Volkswagen Van Centre Glasgow in May 2013, and Colborne Group in March 2014. On 3 September 2015, Lookers acquired Tyneside based Benfield Motor Group for ¬£87.5 million and expanded to become the third biggest car dealership in the country. The deal saw Lookers plc expand further into the North East and Cumbria. Benfield brands include Nissan, Renault, Volkswagen, ≈†koda, Kia, Honda, Hyundai, Lexus, Toyota and Ford. The company headquarters moved to Altrincham in July 2017. Operations Lookers plc operates a national network of car dealerships, featuring a wide range of car manufacturers, including the volume brands Vauxhall and Renaults. The company also has dealerships for a number of high end manufacturers, including Ferrari in Northern Ireland, and Jaguar in Northern Ireland and Scotland. The company also sells agricultural vehicles, equipment and machinery, and operates the United Kingdom's leading wholesale auto parts distributor, FPS Distribution. Investigation In June 2019, the company announced it would be investigated by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) over its sales processes from 2016 to 2019. In December 2018, the company completed an independent review that found control issues with the group‚Äôs sale processes. The review was shared with the FCA. Just over a week later, chief financial officer Robin Gregson left and was succeeded by Mark Raban. In November 2019, chief executive Andy Bruce and chief operating officer Nigel McMinn resigned. In March 2020 the company delayed the announcement of its results after the discovery of \\"potentially fraudulent transactions\\". In June 2020, Lookers announced that it will cut out 1,200 jobs and sell or reorganize 12 sites in order to save around ¬£50 million. The company discovered fraudulent transactions, misstatement in debtor balances and false expenses claims at one of its divisions. The investigation was extended across all its operating divisions.

The eddy covariance (also known as eddy correlation and eddy flux) technique is a key atmospheric measurement technique to measure and calculate vertical turbulent fluxes within atmospheric boundary layers. The method analyzes high-frequency wind and scalar atmospheric data series, gas, energy, and momentum, which yields values of fluxes of these properties. It is a statistical method used in meteorology and other applications (micrometeorology, oceanography, hydrology, agricultural sciences, industrial and regulatory applications, etc.) to determine exchange rates of trace gases over natural ecosystems and agricultural fields, and to quantify gas emissions rates from other land and water areas. It is frequently used to estimate momentum, heat, water vapour, carbon dioxide and methane fluxes.Baldocchi, D., B. Hicks, and T. Meyers. 1988.

The technique is mathematically complex, and requires significant care in setting up and processing data. To date, there is no uniform terminology or a single methodology for the Eddy Covariance technique, but much effort is being made by flux measurement networks (e.g., FluxNet, Ameriflux, ICOS, CarboEurope, Fluxnet Canada, OzFlux, NEON, and iLEAPS) to unify the various approaches. An eddy correlation instrument measuring oxygen fluxes in benthic environments. The technique has additionally proven applicable under water to the benthic zone for measuring oxygen fluxes between seafloor and overlying water.Berg, P., H. R√∏y, F. Janssen, V. Meyer, B. B.

In these environments, the technique is generally known as the eddy correlation technique, or just eddy correlation. Oxygen fluxes are extracted from raw measurements largely following the same principles as used in the atmosphere, and they are typically used as a proxy for carbon exchange, which is important for local and global carbon budgets. For most benthic ecosystems, eddy correlation is the most accurate technique for measuring in-situ fluxes. The technique's development and its applications under water remains a fruitful area of research.University of Virginia. Aquatic Eddy Covariance Research Lab.

General principles ;Representation of the air flow in the atmospheric boundary layer Air flow can be imagined as a horizontal flow of numerous rotating eddies, that is, turbulent vortices of various sizes, with each eddy having horizontal and vertical components. The situation looks chaotic, but vertical movement of the components can be measured from the tower. center[4][4] ;Physical meaning of the eddy covariance method At one physical point on the tower, at Time1, Eddy1 moves parcel of air c1 down at the speed w1. Then, at Time2, Eddy2 moves parcel c2 up at the speed w2. Each parcel has gas concentration, pressure, temperature, and humidity. If these factors, along with the speed are known, we can determine the flux. For example, if one knew how many molecules of water went down with eddies at Time 1, and how many molecules went up with eddies at Time2, at the same point, one could calculate the vertical flux of water at this point over this time. So, vertical flux can be presented as a covariance of the vertical wind velocity and the concentration of the entity of interest. center[4][4] ;Summary The 3D wind and another variable (usually gas concentration, temperature or momentum) are decomposed into mean and fluctuating components. The covariance is calculated between the fluctuating component of the vertical wind and the fluctuating component of gas concentration. The measured flux is proportional to the covariance. The area from which the detected eddies originate is described probabilistically and called a flux footprint. The flux footprint area is dynamic in size and shape, changing with wind direction, thermal stability and measurements height, and has a gradual border. The effect of sensor separation, finite sampling length, sonic path averaging, as well as other instrumental limitations, affect frequency response of the measurement system and may need a co-spectral correction, especially noticeable with closed-path instruments and at low heights below 1 to 1.5 m. Mathematical foundation In mathematical terms, \\"eddy flux\\" is computed as a covariance between instantaneous deviation in vertical wind speed (w') from the mean value (w-overbar) and instantaneous deviation in gas concentration, mixing ratio (s'), from its mean value (s-overbar), multiplied by mean air density (œÅa). Several mathematical operations and assumptions, including Reynolds decomposition, are involved in getting from physically complete equations of the turbulent flow to practical equations for computing \\"eddy flux\\", as shown below. center center[4][4] Major assumptions * Measurements at a point can represent an upwind area * Measurements are done inside the boundary layer of interest * Fetch/flux footprint is adequate ‚Äì fluxes are measured only at area of interest * Flux is fully turbulent ‚Äì most of the net vertical transfer is done by eddies * Terrain is horizontal and uniformed: average of fluctuations is zero; density fluctuations negligible; flow convergence & divergence negligible * Instruments can detect very small changes at high frequency, ranging from minimum of 5 Hz and to 40 Hz for tower-based measurements Software Currently (2011) there are many software programs M.

Uses Common uses: *Greenhouse gas emissions *Carbon dioxide emission monitoring *Methane emissions monitoring *Measuring water loss, evapotranspiration *Instantaneous water use efficiency *Instantaneous radiation use efficiency Novel uses: *Precision irrigation, precision agriculture *Carbon Sequestration and Capture monitoring *Landfill gas emissions into the atmosphere *Emissions of gases displaced by hydraulic fracturing into the atmosphere *Gas leak detection and location *Methane emission from permafrost regions *Biogenic VOCs emission *Reactive trace gas exchange flux measurement  Common Applications  Evapotranspiration: Remote Sensing is an approach to modeling evapotranspiration using an energy balance and the latent heat flux to find evapotranspiration rates. Evapotranspiration (ET) is a part of the water cycle, and accurate ET readings are important to local and global models to manage water resources. ET rates are an important part of research in hydrology related fields, as well as for farming practices. MOD16 is an example of a program which measures ET best for temperate climates. Micrometeorology: Micrometeorology focuses climate study on the specific vegetation canopy scale, again with applications to hydrological and ecologic research. In this context, eddy covariance can be used to measure heat mass flux in the boundary surface layer, or in the boundary layer surrounding the vegetation canopy. The effects of turbulence may for example be of specific interest to climate modelers or those studying the local ecosystem. Wind speed, turbulence, and mass (heat) concentration are values that could be recorded in a flux tower. Through measurements related to eddy covariance properties such as roughness coefficients may be empirically calculated, with applications to modeling. Wetland Ecosystems: Wetland vegetation varies widely and varies from plant to plant ecologically. Primary plant existence in wetlands can be monitored by using Eddy Covariance technology in conjunction with nutrient supply information by monitoring net CO2 and H20 fluxes. Readings can be taken from flux towers over a number of years to determine water use efficiency among others. Greenhouse Gasses And Their Warming Effect: Fluxes of greenhouse gasses from vegetation and agricultural fields can be measured by eddy covariance as referenced in micrometeorology section above. By measuring vertical turbulent flux of gas states of H20, CO2, heat, and CH4 among other volatile organic compounds monitoring equipment can be used to infer canopy interaction. Landscape wide interpretations can be then inferred using the above data. High operational cost, weather limitations (some equipment is better suited for certain climates), and their resulting technical limitations may limit measurement accuracy. Vegetation Production In Terrestrial Ecosystems: Vegetation production models require accurate ground observations, in this context from eddy covariant flux measurement. Eddy covariance is used to measure the net primary production, and gross primary productions of plant populations. Advancements in technology have allowed for minor fluctuations resulting in a scale of 100-2000 meter measurements of air mass and energy readings. Study of the carbon cycle on vegetated growth and production is vitally important to both growers and scientists. Using such information carbon flux between ecosystems and the atmosphere can be observed, with applications ranging from climate change to weather models.  Related methods = Eddy accumulation  True eddy accumulation = The true eddy accumulation technique can be used to measure fluxes of trace gases for which there are no fast enough analysers available, thus where the eddy covariance technique is unsuitable. The basic idea is that upwards moving air parcels (updrafts) and downwards moving air parcels (downdrafts) are sampled proportionally to their velocity into separate reservoirs. A slow response gas analyser can then be used to quantify the average gas concentrations in both updraft and downdraft reservoirs. = Relaxed eddy accumulation = The main difference between the true and the relaxed eddy accumulation technique is that the latter samples air with a constant flow rate that is not proportional to the vertical wind speed.

It is located in Flanders (Belgium), mainly in the province of Antwerp but also partially in the province of East Flanders. It is a seaport in the heart of Europe accessible to capesize ships. It is Europe‚Äôs second-largest seaport, after Rotterdam. Antwerp stands at the upper end of the tidal estuary of the Scheldt. The estuary is navigable by ships of more than 100,000 Gross Tons as far as 80 km inland. Like Hamburg, the Port of Antwerp's inland location provides a more central location in Europe than the majority of North Sea ports. Antwerp's docks are connected to the hinterland by rail, road, and river and canal waterways. As a result, the port of Antwerp has become one of Europe's largest seaports, ranking second behind Rotterdam by total freight shipped. Its international rankings vary from 11th to 20th (AAPA). In 2012, the Port of Antwerp handled 14,220 sea trade ships (190.8 million tons of cargo, 53.6% in containers), 57,044 inland barges (123.2 million tons of cargo),http://www.portofantwerp.com/nl/publications/statistieken/statistisch- jaarboek-2013 and offered liner services to 800 different maritime destinations. History This 1897 map clearly shows the state of dock development at the end of the 19th century. The docks on the south side of the city (at bottom) were filled in during the 1970s. Antwerp's potential was recognized by Napoleon Bonaparte and he ordered the construction of Antwerp's first lock and dock in 1811. Called the Bonaparte Dock, it was joined by a second dock - called the Willem Dock after the Dutch King - in 1813. When the Belgian revolution broke out in 1830, there was a well-founded fear that the Dutch would blockade the Scheldt again but, in the event, they contented themselves with levying a stiff toll. Fortunately, the young Belgium had friends in Britain and particularly in the person of Lord Palmerston, who believed the existence of Belgium would be beneficial to Britain, and that, in consequence, it was important to make sure that the newly born state was economically viable. With his support, the Belgian government was able to redeem the Dutch Toll in 1863. By that time, the Kattendijk Dock had been completed in 1860 and the all important Iron Rhine Railway to the Ruhr had been finished in 1879. Antwerp then experienced a second golden age and by 1908 eight docks had been constructed. The opening of the Royers Lock, commenced in 1905, meant that ships drawing up to of water were able to enter the existing docks and access the new Lef√®bvre and America docks. Such was the situation at the outbreak of the First World War in 1914. The British, and Winston Churchill, then First Lord of the Admiralty, in particular were well aware of the Port of Antwerp's strategic importance, so much so that Churchill arrived in Antwerp on 4 October 1914 to take charge of the defence of the city and its port. In 1944 during the Second World War Allied forces liberated Antwerp on 4 September. The port and facilities were relatively undamaged and no major reconstruction work was required. However the port could not be used until 28 November, after the estuary approaches were cleared by the Battle of the Scheldt. Walcheren was the key that allowed use of the port, located further upstream on the right bank of the southern estuary of the river. Walcheren was attacked by Canadian and British forces and on 8 November all German resistance on the island had been overrun. An agreement assigned a large portion of the northern section of the port to the Americans and the southern section and the city of Antwerp to the British forces. The first US cargo vessel James B. Weaver arrived on 28 November 1944Hastings, M. Armageddon p158, Macmillan, London 2004 with men of the 268th Port Company and their equipment on board. By mid-December the port was operating in high gear and, on average, some 9,000 civilians were employed by the Americans. Despite enemy air attacks, rockets and buzz bombs, operations were never entirely halted, although they were interrupted. In the first half year of 1945, the average amount of cargo discharged was around 0.5 million tons per month. After the close of the hostilities in Europe, the port was used for shipments of ammunition, vehicles, tanks and personnel to the Pacific. After the capitulation of Japan, shipments were directed to the United States. As from November 1945 the activities declined and by October 1946 all US Army operations ceased.U.S. Army in World War II, The Transportation Corps: Operations Overseas, van J. Bykofsky en H. Larson, Office of the Chief of Military History, Department of the Army, Washington DC, 1957. Page: 320-324 When peace returned work started on the Grote Doorsteek, an ambitious plan which ultimately resulted in the extension of the docklands on the right bank of the Scheldt to the Dutch border. The construction of the Berendrecht Lock was the crowning element of this plan. It was the world's largest shipping lock when inaugurated in 1989. Since 1989, development has been concentrated on the creation of fast turnround tidal berths, both on the Right Bank (Europa Terminal and the North Sea Terminal) and on the Left Bank (Deurganck Dock).Antwerp - Portrait of a Port, George van Cauwenbergh, Antwerpse Lloyd - Antwerpen 1983 Port lay-out This aerial photograph strikingly illustrates the extent of Antwerp's infrastructure before works started on the Deurganck Dock. The Scheldt runs from South to North between the geometrical outlines of the docks on the Left and Right Banks. Other details include the Brussels‚ÄìScheldt Maritime Canal at bottom centre, the Albert Canal (the thin line running South East from the docks), the Rhine-Scheldt Junction Canal (top centre) and the Ghent‚ÄìTerneuzen Canal at top left.Port of Antwerp The Right Bank With the opening of the Berendrecht Lock (1989), a crowning achievement in developing the right bank dock complex was obtained. With a length of 500 m between the lock gates and a width of 68 m, the Berendrecht lock was the largest lock in the world when it was built (overtaken by the Kieldrecht lock on Antwerp's Left bank). This lock has a depth of 13.50 m, which makes the sill depth at mean high water equal to 17.75 m. Apart from the Lock, still further development of the right bank has been undertaken on the banks of the Scheldt outside the dock complex. Two large container terminals have been opened here. In 1990, the Europe terminal was operative, while secondly, the North Sea terminal became operative in 1997. The older areas of the port, such as the Bonaparte dock,The Bonaparte Dock is now a marina facility for yachts and small craft are being modernized as needs dictate to make them suitable for modern cargo handling operations. Among this modernisation, an upgrade of the Amerika dock, the Albert dock and the third harbour dock are being done to make them accessible to Panamax ships, which have a draught of 42 feet (13 m). Other modernisation projects being undertaken is the Bevrijdings dock(formerly known as the Delwaide dock), which will soon be able to serve the latest generation of container vessels. The Southern part of the Delwaide dock, used to be the MSC Home Terminal, a partnership between PSA Hesse-Noord Natie and Mediterranean Shipping Company (MSC), before it moved to the newly built Deurganckdok on the left bank, to avoid passage through the locks. Due to a total quay length of more than 2 km, several ships can be handled at the same time. The MSC Home Terminal has an annual capacity of more than . The Left Bank The first plans for the development of the Waaslandhaven on Antwerp‚Äôs left bank were prepared in the boom years of the 1960s. At that time, it was hoped that agreement could be reached with the Dutch on the construction of the Baalhoek Canal, which would have run from Kallo in Belgium through the Drowned Land of Saefthinge (on Dutch territory) into the Western Scheldt. This grand concept had the advantage that it would cut off the difficult bend known as the Bocht van Bath and facilitate access to deep draught ships. Work started on the Kallo Lock in 1979, and by the end of the 1980s the basic outlines of the Waaslandhaven were by and large complete. The main constituents are the Waasland Canal, the Verrebroek Dock, and the Vrasene Dock. The abandonment of the Baalhoek Canal project meant that an additional dock, known as the Doel Dock, would never be fitted out for shipping. The development of the sites in the new docklands got off to a slow start, but took off in the 1990s. Nowadays, the trades handled in the Vrasene Dock include forest products, fruit juice, cars, plastic granulates, scrap and bulk gas. The equipping of the Verrebroek Dock started in 1996 and saw the arrival of its first seagoing ship in 2000. When finalized, this dock will offer a total of 5 km of berths with a draught of 14.5 m. The Deurganck Dock Since the existing container terminals on the right bank of the Scheldt have reached their maximum capacity and the container freight volume keeps increasing (in 2007 it expanded by 8.2% to ), a new dock complex was constructed: the tidal Deurganck Dock, which is open to the river and which does not require vessels to pass through any lock. The first terminal in this dock was opened on July 6, 2005. The full capacity of the dock is estimated at more than . The Deurganck dock has a wharf length of 5.5 kmPort of Antwerp pamphlet \\"The Deurganck Dock\\", 2014 and consists of a total of 1,200,000 cubic metres of concrete. The Kieldrecht Lock, a new lock at the end of the Deurganckdock, giving access to the docks in the port area on the left bank opened in June 2016 and is the largest lock in the world. The lock is deeper than the Berendrecht Lock, the previous largest, in response to the trend towards ever-larger ships. The lock, which represents an investment of 340 million euros, is the second lock into the enclosed harbours and represents a failsafe feature; had the sole lock failed, any vessels inside would have been trapped, whereas it is highly improbable that both locks might simultaneously fail. On the landward side, facing the dock complex, the lock leads into the Waasland canal. From there the ships have easy access to all the other docks on the left bank: the Doel dock, the Verrebroek dock, the Vrasene dock and the North and South mooring docks. Since 2015, the north side of the dock is operated by the joint venture between MSC and PSA international, commonly referred to as MPET. The south side of the dock is operated by DP world, the terminal is known by the name 'Antwerp Gateway'. Recent History In October 2010, the port approved a long-term investment plan, worth 1.6 billion Euros over the next 15 years. The port would improve existing facilities, and acquire land from General Motors which is closing its Antwerp factory. Unlike the Port of Rotterdam, which has been able to expand westwards along the river Maas to Europoort and extend into the North Sea with Maasvlakte, Antwerp has little scope for further westward expansion. The northern (right bank) docks already reach the Dutch border, and on the left bank Belgium has a nuclear power plant downstream of the Deurganck dock. In October 2019, the Port of Antwerp began using a dual-fuel tug that is powered by hydrogen and diesel (called HydroTug). Lillo Port Centre On the east bank of the river Scheldt, but to the west of the main port area lies the old village of Lillo, where the Port of Antwerp has built a new visitor centre. Coach parties can arrive here, and (after a brief introduction and the donning of hard hats and hi-viz jackets) an official guide boards the coach and directs the party to visit places that would otherwise be prohibited under ISPS. In July, 2020, The total throughput of the Port of Antwerp fell by 4.9% in the first half of the year compared to the same period in 2019.

After considerable \\"shuttle diplomacy\\" negotiations by Henry Kissinger, the conference opened on 21 December 1973 under the auspices of the United Nations Secretary General, with the United States and the USSR as co-chairmen. The foreign ministers of Egypt, Jordan and Israel were in attendance. The table with Syria's nameplate remained unoccupied, although Syria had indicated possible future participation. Each foreign minister spoke, mainly directed to their domestic audiences rather than to each other. Kissinger articulated his step-by-step strategy and stated that the goal of the conference was peace; the immediate need was to strengthen the cease-fire by accomplishing a disengagement of forces as the \\"essential first step\\" toward implementation of UN 242. The meeting was then adjourned.William B. Quandt, Peace Process, 2005, p. 140‚Äì141 Although no agreement was reached at Geneva, the effort was not in vain. Following the Israeli election, a military disengagement between Israel and Egypt was signed on 18 January 1974, and a disengagement between Israel and Syria was signed on 31 May. Although attempts in later years to revive the Conference failed, the Sinai Interim Agreement between Israel and Egypt was formally signed in Geneva on 4 September 1975, as part of the Geneva Conference process. This agreement stated that the conflicts between Egypt and Israel \\"shall not be resolved by military force but by peaceful means.\\"  Egypt's goals  By the time of the accession of Anwar Sadat as president, Egypt was disassociating itself from Arab nationalism and from radical regimes in the region. Egypt discouraged the participation of those nations in the Geneva Conference. The Egyptians' primary goal was to win back the territory they lost in 1967 to Israel in the Six-Day War under president Gamal Abdel Nasser. This was their goal during the Yom Kippur War just prior to the conference and the goal during the Camp David Accords in 1978.  Palestinian representation issue  The Egyptians, Americans, Jordanians, and the Soviets hoped that, through the conference, some sort of international agreement on the Palestinian problem and on which specific persons would represent Palestinians in international affairs would be developed. Egypt was in favor of the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) to represent the Palestinians and to join Egypt, Israel, the United States, and other established nations in the Geneva Conference. Syrian officials went one step further and insisted that if the PLO was not present at the Geneva Conference, Syria would not be present either. Israel and the United States opposed formal recognition of the PLO at the Geneva Conference because the PLO Charter did not recognize Israel's right to exist.Meital, 145‚Äì146 Thus, no representatives from Syria were present at the conference either.Eran, 129  US‚ÄìSoviet relations  The Geneva Conference was the last time that the US accepted the Soviet Union as a co-equal partner in Middle East peace efforts. Later, the marked shift in the allegiance of Egypt ‚Äì a decades-long Soviet ally which abruptly moved into the American orbit ‚Äì enabled the US to shut out the Soviets and assert a role as the sole mediator between Israelis and Arabs, manifested first in Israeli- Egyptian relations and later also in Israeli-Palestinian relations.

Both pieces were painted by the Flemish artist Peter Paul Rubens in Antwerp, Belgium, the original in 1610 and the latter in 1638. The original is in the Cathedral of Our Lady, as the church for which it was painted has been destroyed. The smaller version is now in the Art Gallery of Ontario, Canada. Another smaller triptych with a different composition, and an oil study, are in the Louvre in Paris. Anton Gunther Gheringh - Interior of the former Saint Walpurga church of Antwerp Peter Paul Rubens painted the triptych The Elevation of the Cross after returning to Antwerp from Italy in 1610-1611 as commissioned by the church authorities of the Church of St. Walburga. Cornelis van der Geest, a wealthy merchant and churchwarden of the Church of St. Walburga, secured this commission for Rubens and funded the majority of the project. Under Napoleon's rule, the emperor took the painting, along with Peter Paul Rubens's The Descent from the Cross, to Paris. The paintings were returned to Antwerp in 1815, but since St. Walburga had been destroyed, they were placed in the Cathedral of Our Lady in Antwerp instead. The Antwerp triptych was positioned above the high altar preceded by a set of stairs, making it visible from a great distance in the vast Gothic cathedral of St. Walburga. This height was unusual for an altarpiece indicating its important presence in St. Walburga. While it was present in St. Walburga, the painting was surrounded on all sides by images of God the Father, Christ, angels, and at the top of the structure was a wood pelican, which was a common representation of Christ's sacrifice based on a folk lore associated with the bird feeding its young with its own blood.  Visual analysis  Composite image Jesus Christ and the elevation of his cross are the focal points for this artwork, with features of the story overflowing from the middle panel onto the wings on both sides. This altarpiece is an early attempt by Ruben's to employ the intensity of the Baroque style. The setting is dark and restless as the group of spectators, soldiers, horses, and the strained bodies of the executioners surround the soon-to-be crucified Christ. Jesus' body is a picture of classical nobility; with arms raised and gaze turned upward, Rubens emphasizes Christ's willing sacrifice over the horrors of his crucifixion. Christ's suffering is made apparent in his strained and tense body, hands clenched tight around the nails in his hands, and his head contorted in the last moments of agonizing pain. The three panels together work harmoniously, creating a continuous scene. The central panel illustrates a tension between the multitude of massively muscled men attempting to lift the cross and the seemingly unbearable weight of Christ on the cross. In the left wing, the Virgin and Saint John are identified in a group of onlookers, horrified to see the executioners perform their duties. The thieves in the right wing are being prepared for execution as the Roman officers issue their orders. Rubens also paints the outside of the wings, illustrating four saints that were venerated in Flanders during this time period. On the far left stands St. Amandus clothed impressively in bishop robes, with St. Walburga positioned alongside him. On the right outer wing stands Saint Catherine of Alexandria, accompanied by Saint Eligius.  Influences  alt= The Entombment alt= The work shows the clear influence of Italian Renaissance and Baroque artists such as Caravaggio, Tintoretto and Michelangelo. Peter Paul Rubens's foreshortening is evident in the contortions of the struggling, strapping men, which is reminiscent of Tintoretto's Crucifixion in the Scuola di San Rocco in Venice. Rubens's version creates a more compelling, intense and emotional response through the re-positioning of Christ. Christ cuts across the central panel diagonally, akin to Caravaggio's Entombment where both descent and ascent are in play at a key moment. Rubens represents light with tenebrism, reflecting on the influence of Caravaggio. Christ's perfectly molded body alludes to the nude figures painted by Michelangelo on the ceilings of the Sistine Chapel. The Council of Trent played a significant role in the subject matter and themes of Rubens's painting. Rubens emanates the spirit of the Counter- Reformation by representing the victorious nature of Christ's death while maintaining his divine nature. The Elevation of the Cross is an accurate biblical representation of the crucifixion of Christ, in keeping with the specific guidelines for art as produced by the Council of Trent.  The artists' workshop  Peter Paul Rubens was not fully responsible for the creation of this artwork, which is the reality for many of Rubens's paintings. The period after which Rubens arrived in Antwerp was a particularly busy time for the painter, and consisted of responsibilities beyond painting. Rubens was head of a workshop that consisted of a hierarchy of pupils, assistants, and collaborators ‚Äì all of which played an important role in the creation of the painting. Rubens would have done all the sketches and designs for the works being created in his workshop. As displayed in the cathedral In terms of the Elevation of the Cross, Rubens started the creative process with oil and brush on a small panel. Also called a modello, this oil sketch served as a sample painting for the patron to approve the overall story and imagery, especially paying attention to the iconographic details. The modello also served as a model for the assistants to start the preliminary steps of the full scale painting. No major iconographic changes were made in the case of Rubens's Elevation of the Cross, but a few details such as the position of the cross were adjusted. The sketch was critiqued by the patrons, who preferred to put Christ in a more upright position as well as turning his body and face more towards the audience to heighten the drama of the piece. Once the assistants had established the general composition, Rubens turned his attention towards the human figures. In this stage, Rubens used chalk to make drawings with live models present, positioning the models in the various poses as predetermined in the modello. These separate drawings were used in conjunction with the modello in the final execution of the large scale painting. Rubens made sure to touch up all the paintings once the assistants had completed their portion.  Smaller version  The Elevation of the Cross is also the title of a smaller oil on paper painting reproduction of the triptych. It measured 60 √ó 126.5 cm, but was later enlarged to 70 √ó 131.5 cm. This smaller painting is a representative of modified reproduction of the much earlier triptych. Also painted by Rubens, he completed the piece around 1638, and it was given to Hans Witdoeck, to use as a modello. The smaller painting is unique from the original, however, with the addition of color accents throughout the composition. The most notable difference seen between the 1611 painting and the 1638 painting is the elimination of the frames. The removal of the breaks created a more cohesive scene. Figures not seen in the earlier version are added, as well as some changes in the landscape. Due to its size, some have suggested the painting may have been conceived as an independent painting to The Elevation of the Cross, to be given as a personal gift to Cornelis van der Geest. The painting is now in the Art Gallery of Ontario's permanent collection, after it was purchased from George Holford in 1928. Notes References  * Dunton, Larkin (1896). The World and its People.

The traditional origin of the name Tondela is made concrete at Chafariz das Sereias (literally, \\"Spring of the Mermaids\\"), a sculpted spring of stone depicting a woman holding a trumpet. Legend suggests this female figure represents a woman who monitored the movements of Moorish forces across the mountains from her lookout. When she discovered an impending attack she would sound the horn, and at the sound of this instrument the settlers would arise to meet the enemy. The phrase \\"ao'tom'dela\\"‚Äîliterally, \\"at her sound\\" or \\"at the sound of it\\"‚Äîwas transformed into the name Tondela. Documents from the 9th, 10th, and 12th century designate this region Terra de Balistariis. This designation arises from the word ballista, a ranged weapon used by besteiros (\\"crossbowmen\\") during the Middle Ages. The current municipality was until 1836 the seat of the historical municipality of Besteiros, whose name continues to be seen in some historical documents, references, and coat of arms of Tondela. To this former administrative division were annexed through successive administrative reforms the older entities of Serra do Caramulo, S√£o Jo√£o do Monte, and Guard√£o. The lowlands of Mouraz, Sabugosa, Canas de Santa Maria, S√£o Miguel de Outeiro, and a few parishes that were part of Viseu or the smaller municipalities of Barreiro and Treixedo were also extended into Tondela. Geography A view of Campo de Besteiros, located in the northwest- central mountains of Serra do Caramulo Tondela is divided into 19 civil parishes (freguesias): * Barreiro de Besteiros e Tourigo * Campo de Besteiros * Canas de Santa Maria * Caparrosa e Silvares * Castel√µes * Dardavaz * Ferreir√≥s do D√£o * Guard√£o * Lajeosa do D√£o * Lob√£o da Beira * Molelos * Mouraz e Vila Nova da Rainha * Parada de Gonta * Santiago de Besteiros * S√£o Jo√£o do Monte e Mosteirinho * S√£o Miguel do Outeiro e Sabugosa * Tonda * Tondela e Nandufe * Vilar de Besteiros e Mosteiro de Fr√°guas Sport The Clube Desportivo de Tondela is the main sports club in the municipality.

It includes an abundance of whole grains, fruits, vegetables, fresh fish and seafood. Poultry is eaten more often than red meat, and when red meat is eaten, it is usually lamb and goat meat. It also includes copious amounts of garlic and olive oil, often seasoned with lemon juice. Chickpeas and parsley are also staples of the Lebanese diet. Well-known savoury dishes include baba ghanouj, a dip made of char-grilled eggplant; falafel, small deep-fried patties made of highly spiced ground chickpeas, fava beans, or a combination of the two; and shawarma, a sandwich with marinated meat skewered and cooked on large rods. An important component of many Lebanese meals is hummus, a dip or spread made of blended chickpeas, sesame tahini, lemon juice, and garlic, typically eaten with flatbread. A well known dessert is baklava, which is made of layered filo (thinly rolled pastry) filled with nuts and steeped in date syrup or honey. Some desserts are specifically prepared on special occasions: the meghli (rice pudding dessert, spiced with anise, caraway, and cinnamon) for instance, is served to celebrate a newborn baby in the family. Arak is an anise (aromatic spice) flavoured moonshine, and is the Lebanese national drink, usually served with a traditional convivial Lebanese meal. Another historic and traditional drink is Lebanese wine.  History  Lebanon at the crossroads of the Mediterranean Basin and the Arabian hinterlands, Western Asia (in red) Lebanese cuisine is an ancient one and part of the cuisine of the Levant. Many dishes in Lebanese cuisine can be traced back thousands of years to eras of Roman, Greek, Persian, Byzantine, Arab, Egyptian, and Phoenician rule. In the last 500 years, Lebanese cuisine has been influenced by the different foreign civilizations that held power. From 1516 to 1918, the Ottoman Turks controlled Lebanon and introduced a variety of foods that have become staples in the Lebanese diet, such as cooking with lamb. After the Ottomans were defeated in World War I (1914‚Äì1918), France took control of Lebanon until 1943, when the country achieved its independence. The French introduced foods such as flan, a caramel custard dessert dating back to the 16th century AD, eclairs, french fries and croissants. The Lebanese diaspora who live worldwide have introduced new ingredients, spices and culinary practices into Lebanese cuisine, keeping the cuisine innovative and renowned both beyond and within its borders.  Overview  Most often, foods are grilled, baked or lightly cooked in olive oil; butter or cream is rarely used, other than in a few desserts. Vegetables are often eaten raw, pickled, or cooked. Like most Mediterranean countries, much of what the Lebanese eat is dictated by the seasons and what is available. Lebanese cuisine also varies by region. South Lebanon is famous for its kibbe, the Beqaa Valley for its meat pastries (such as sfiha), and north Lebanon and Saida (Sidon) for its sweets.In Lebanon, very rarely are drinks served without being accompanied by food. Similar to the tapas of Spain, mezeluri of Romania and aperitivo of Italy, mezze is an array of small dishes placed before the guests creating an array of colors, flavors, textures and aromas. This style of serving food is less a part of family life than it is of entertaining and caf√©s. Mezze may be as simple as raw or pickled vegetables, hummus, baba ghanouj and bread, or it may become an entire meal consisting of grilled marinated seafood, skewered meats and a variety of cooked and raw salads and an arrangement of desserts. The assortments of dishes forming the mezze are generally consumed in small bites using a piece of flatbread. A typical mezze will consist of an elaborate variety of thirty hot and cold dishes and may include: * Salads such as tabbouleh and fattoush. * Dips such as hummus, baba ghanoush and moutabal. *Kebbeh, kafta and falafel (fried chickpea balls). * Some patties such as the sambusac. *Stuffed grape leaves and pickles. * Roasted nuts, olives and vegetables. * Condiments like toum and taratour, ideal for spread on sfiha. When dining as a family, the mezze typically consists of three or four dishes, but when served in the restaurant, the mezze can range from twenty to sixty dishes, as the variant combinations and dishes involved are plenty. Family cuisine also offers a range of dishes, such as stews (yakhneh) which can be cooked in many forms depending on the ingredients used and are usually served with meat and rice. Although simple fresh fruits are often served towards the end of a Lebanese meal, there is also dessert, such as baklava and coffee. When sweets are not available, fruits are typically eaten after meals, including figs, oranges and other citrus fruits, apples, grapes, cherries and green plums (Janarek). Although baklava is the most internationally known dessert, there is a great variety of Lebanese desserts.  Dishes and ingredients  Lebanese dishes are heavily influenced by the multiple civilisations that have existed within the region, especially the Arab-Muslim contribution, which has accumulated together to form the modern Lebanese cuisine. Using fresh, flavourful ingredients and spices, Lebanese cuisine combines Turkish, Arab, and French cooking styles. Characteristics include the use of lamb (introduced by the Ottomans); the abundant use of nuts, especially almonds and pine nuts; and dressings made from lemon juice.  Bread  \\\\---- One of the stages of baking Khubz manaeesh and other bread presented in a Lebanese eatery The Lebanese use bread as an integral part of a meal and food is generally not served without it. Khubz is a round flatbread baked in a mud oven. It can be used in almost all kinds of Lebanese dishes. Similarly, taboon bread is traditionally baked in a taboon oven or a tannur, and is similar to the various tandoor breads found in many parts of Asia. Marquq is a similar bread to khubz, but is prepared much thinner, almost paper thin. Ka'ak is another common Lebanese street bread that is usually consumed as a snack. There are many variations of ka'ak, from being sprinkled with traditional sesame seeds on top, to being stuffed with cheese and zaatar.https://www.tasteatlas.com/most-popular-street-foods-in-lebanon Manaeesh (mini pizza) traditionally garnished with cheese (kashk in its Lebanese version), za'atar, spicy diced tomatoes and may be eaten for breakfast. These are made in many variants in any number of local bakeries or Furns (Furn Assalam, Ain El Hilwe, Saida), Some bakeries allow customers to bring their own toppings in order to build their own customized manaeesh for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. Variants include manakousheh zaatar (thyme pizza) and manakousheh jebneh which has only cheese. Manaeesh can also be eaten with minced meat and onions.  Dairy  \\\\----Cheese, of varying origins, as well as yogurt and eggs, are commonly used in Lebanon. One of the more recognizable dishes within Lebanon is the yogurt labneh. Unlike regular yogurt, labneh is strained so as to remove the watery whey, leaving a thicker, creamier consistency. It is spreadable and garnished with olive oil and sea salt. It is an extremely versatile dish that can be served in a mezze platter for either breakfast or dinner. The variant labneh bi toum is mixed with garlic. Grilled halloumi cheese Ackawi (also akkawi), named after the city Acre (Akka in Arabic), is a salty white cheese made from pasteurized cow's milk but can also be made with goat or sheep milk. Halloum (originally from Cyprus) is a semi-hard unripened cheese, perfect for grilling and frying. Along with akkawi, these are traditionally stored in brine, giving them a strong, salty taste. However, modern methods have allowed a variety to be sold fresher with moderate salting. Labneh, topped with zaatar Nabulsi, also spelled Naboulsi (from the city Nablus), is similar to halloumi and is made by boiling fresh ackawi cheese in a mixture of spices and seeds to be fried, grilled or eaten and is used in the important and integral dessert, knafeh, a cheese pastry soaked in a sugar-based syrup. Feta (from Greece) is used in salads and other dishes, although some cooks will use a milder cheese called jibtieh baidha (simply \\"white cheese\\"). Kashkaval is another European cheese popular in many Eastern European countries that has made its way into Lebanese cusine. It melts very quickly and is practical for pasta, pizza and sandwiches. Another popular cheese, shanklish, is made from cow's milk which is salted, fermented and seasoned with thyme and pepper and formed into cheese balls, coated in red pepper chilli flakes. Ejjeh is the traditional omelette of Lebanon. It is made with egg, chopped parsley and scallions. Within Lebanon, people make this omelette with different herbs that are cultivated from their village.  Stews  \\\\----Lebanese stews, often served with rice or flatbread, are prepared in many varieties depending on the accessibility of various ingredients.leftOkra and tomato stew (bamieh bi-zeit) is one of the most popular. Traditionally, it is served with rice and a basic salad dressed with lemon juice and olive oil, with fresh warm bread. This stew combines the distinct flavor of okra with a flavourful tomato sauce. A alternative version to this, bamya bel lahmeh adds small pieces of fillet lamb or beef that have been saut√©ed beforehand to avoid a boiled taste.Lebanese mulukhiyah chicken stew, served with rice, vinegar, onions and toasted pita bread Bean stews are commonplace due to the accessibility of various beans grown. An example of a mixed bean Lebanese stew is makhlouta which is prepared with a variety of beans, wheat, and legumes and is popular in the town of Baskinta. Others include fava bean stew, kidney bean stew (fasoulya hamanieh) and another kidney and lentil stew called mjadrat fasoulya popular in Rashaya. Taro and lentil stew (abu shoushe) and spinach stew (yakhnet sabanikh) are a few more of the many different stews available. Mulukhiyah is a stew with mallow leaves, chicken, beef, and in the Lebanese fashion, topped with raw chopped onions, and vinegar. In northern Lebanon, a similar dish to Mulukhiyah is called mloukhiye b'zeit. it is made using fresh leaves and shoots of the Nalta jute plant, cooked in olive oil, onions, garlic, tomatoes and chilli peppers; it is a popular summer side dish, especially in Miniyeh-Danniyeh and Akkar districts. In summer one of the easiest and simplest ways to make use of the abundant summer zucchini is Mfaraket Koussa (spicy zucchini stew). Daoud bacha, another meat-based stew consists of beef meatballs (also lamb) with cinammon, parsley and stuffed with pinenuts in a tomato sauce.  Vegetarian  \\\\---- Vegetarian cuisine plays an important role in the cuisine of Lebanon. Being located in the Levant, vegetables and herbs (wild or cultivated) are abundant in the fertile landscape and serve as a main base of the cuisine. Some of the most popular street foods in Lebanon are vegetarian including fava beans, hot roasted peanuts served in a paper cone, prickly pears (served peeled and on ice), ful medames (fava beans) and balila (chickpeas seasoned with cumin). Nearly everything can be cooked either with meat or b‚Äôzeit (oil), from beans to fish, stews and spinach. Meat was traditionally precious and usually served on a Sunday, but was expensive and usually eaten with bulgur or rice to prolong the shelf life. For Lebanese Christians, including Catholic (Maronites and Melkites) and Orthodox, fasting from meat is practiced over the Lenten period (from midnight to noon) during Easter. Where abstention of meat is observed, the food is referred to as 'akl aateh' (meaning food \\"cut\\" from the diet, such as meat or absent from meat), the particular food that is \\"cut\\" varies over different traditions. = Salads = Ingredients for the Lebanese salad tabbouleh, including parsley, bulgur wheat, olive oil, mint, lemon, tomato, salt, pepper and scallion Fattoush (also called \\"peasants' salad\\") is made with khubz flatbread, cucumbers, tomatoes, chickweed, and mint. Tabbouleh is a diced parsley salad with burghul wheat, tomato, mint and served with lettuce, eaten within a mezze or as a standalone dish as a precursor to a main course. Yogurt cheese salad consists of shanklish balls (yogurt cheese, feta, chilli powder, thyme, cumin, salt and pepper) added to a freshly prepared salad. It is distinctively Lebanese as is a perfect addition for mezze, complimenting arab and Lebanese wines. = Stuffed dishes = Wara' Enab is a dish commonly served as a mezze (appetizer) and is stuffed with either rice and meat or just rice. Another stuffed dish kousa mahshi consists of various kinds of squash or zucchini stuffed with rice and sometimes meat and cooked on the stovetop or in the oven. = Chickpea-based dishes = Fatteh hummus made with chickpeas and spiced yogurtalt=Chickpea dishes include falafel (deep-fried patties made of highly spiced ground chickpeas), hummus (a popular dip for pita bread made of blended chickpeas, sesame tahini, lemon juice, and garlic) and its variants including, Hummus Ras Asfour (with meat on top) and Fateh b'hummus, (a chickpea and spiced yogurt dish). Balila (cumin chickpeas), is a simple yet popular Lebanese dish that has been boiled along with lemon juice, garlic and various spices. = Aubergine-based dishes = Aubergine dishes are common in Lebanon. They include well known dishes such as baba ghanouj (a char- grilled aubergine, made with tahina, olive oil, lemon juice, and garlic puree), mutabbel (mashed cooked aubergines and tahini, mixed with salt, pepper, olive oil, with anar seeds) and makdous, a stuffed eggplant dish served with olive oil. Fried aubergine is also served alongside other fried vegetables including potatoes, courgettes onions and tomatoes. Usually referred to as a \\"mixed fry up\\". One of the most popular dishes in the Levant is fatteh and the popular variant fatet batinjan (eggplant casserole) is served with yoghurt, fried bread and aubergine, served with mate. Unlike the Greek style, Lebanese moussaka is a vegetarian eggplant dish, made with fried eggplant simmered in an onion and tomato sauce with chickpeas. = Bean and legume dishes = Lebanese style ful (cooked fava beans) is a slow cooked mash of brown beans and red lentils dressed with lemon, olive oil, cumin and is best served with various vegetables and pita/khubz. Riz bil-Foul is another dish with fava beans, seasoned with various spices and served with rice. Mujaddara (imjaddarra) is a popular dish found throughout the Middle East and consists of cooked lentils together with wheat or rice, garnished with onions that have been 'sauteed' (lightly cooked in vegetable oil).  Meats  \\\\----Lebanese meat dishes are usually made with chicken or lamb, though pork is also eaten (albeit not as widely, due to Islamic dietary laws). However, meat is expensive everywhere and not always readily available. Dehen, somewhat like a meat shortening made from lamb suet, fried lamb pieces and spices, is often used to give dishes a light meaty flavour without the expense of bulk meat. Habra (raw lamb fillet) is essential for most dishes involving lamb. It is the foundation for many popular dishes including habra nayeeh (raw lamb with onion), kibbeh nayyeh (raw kibbeh), kafta nayyeh (raw beef tartarre) and others including variants of kibbeh. The fillet needs to be prepared and chilled for a minimum of 2 hours, and can even be prepared one day in advance. = Mixed meat = * Shawarma is a commonly found form of street food made with slow-cooked skewered meat (either chicken or lamb) that is thinly sliced and served as a sandwich with toppings such as onions, pickles and tomatoes. Styles of this dish include shawarma lahmeh, grilled meat with parsley, onion and tarator and shawarma djeij which is grilled poultry with toum and lettuce. * Sambousek (also called samboosak, or sambousak bi-lahm) is a small stuffed pastry often filled with meat and served as an appetizer (mezze). Though usually filled with ground beef or lamb, sambousek can also be filled with cheese or other fillings. * Kibbeh is a filled bulgur dough made with ground meat and can be made in different forms including fried (Kibbeh raas), uncooked (kibbeh nayyeh), baked (kibbeh bil-saneeya), and all may be served with yogurt. Some regional versions of kibbeh are a pumpkin-flavoured kebbe lakteen (popular in Beit Mery) and kebbe zghartweih which is a oven-cooked version popular in Ehden. * Kubideh is a type of kebab served with pivaz, a relish made of minced parsley, onions, ground cumin and sumac. * Kafta is made with spiced ground meat that is shaped into small patties or rolled into meatball-shaped balls which are then baked, pan-fried or charcoal-grilled on skewers. Kafta is served with bread and other side dishes. = Lamb = *Tripoli Djaj meshwi, grilled chicken marinated with a garlic lemon sauceBarout del batata ‚Äì spicy lamb served with potatoes. *Deleh mehshi ‚Äì stuffed rib cage of lamb (popular in Broummana). *Laban Immo ‚Äì cooked yoghurt and lamb with rice (popular in Douma). *Kafta meshwi ‚Äì minced lamb mixed with finely chopped onion and parsley, broiled on a skewer over charcoal. *Qawarma ‚Äì originates from a centuries-old custom that was to buy a fat-tailed lamb in the spring and force-feed it day and night with mulberry and grape leaves, wheat hulls and other ingredients ending in a succulent chopped lamb dish, salted and kept in the grease of the animal. *Lahm bil ajƒ©n (or Sfiha) ‚Äì a pastry covered with mutton minced meat, onions, and nuts from the Lebanese town of Baalbek. *Shish barak (Lebanese ravioli) ‚Äì meat dumplings in yogurt sauce. *Khash ‚Äì boiled sheep parts, which might include the head, feet, and stomach (tripe). = Chicken = *Chich taouk ‚Äì charcoaled grilled chicken marinated with garlic lemon and various oriental spices (cinnamon, cumin...) *Djaj meshwi ‚Äì grilled, spiced mildly chicken on bbq marinated with a garlic lemon sauce. *Farrouj meshwi ‚Äì grilled chicken, served with garlic sauce. *Jwenih (or Jawaneh) ‚Äì chicken wings cooked with coriander, garlic and lemon, served as mezze. *Riz bi-djaj ‚Äì chicken and rice. *Shish taouk ‚Äì grilled chicken skewers that utilize only white meat, marinated in olive oil, lemon, parsley, and sumac, served on a bed of rice with almonds and pine nuts. = Beef = Pastirma, a seasoned dried beef, introduced by the Ottomans *Pastirma ‚Äì cured, seasoned dried beef, introduced by the Ottomans. *Tabbouleh bi dehn ‚Äì another version of tabbouleh and is cooked with lentils and beef ghee. *Ghameh ‚Äì a delicacy of stuffed cow intestines. *Kafta bithine ‚Äì spiced meat with sesame concentrate, popular in Beit ed-Dine. = Fish = *Samkeh harra ‚Äì grilled fish that has been marinated with chili, citrus, and cilantro. *Akhtabout ‚Äì grilled octopus (usually served with Samkeh Harra in Beirut). *Siyyadiyeh (or sayadiyeh) ‚Äì delicately spiced fish served on a bed of rice. Fish cooked in saffron and served on rice with onions, sumac, and a tahini sauce (the most important part of the dish) originated in Sidon.  Sweets  \\\\---- The modern form of Lebanese desserts have been influenced by Ottoman cuisine and share many similarities with other neighbouring countries. Muhallebi is a milk pudding made with rice, milk and sugar. Like many other Lebanese desserts, it is sweetened with atar syrup and served with a garnish of assorted nuts. Lebanese style ka'ak with ma'amoul Barazeh, also found in Syrian cuisine, are cookies with a light and crumbly texture; one side is decorated with sesame seeds and the other side with pistachios. Ma'amoul are crumbly cookies filled with pistachios, walnuts or dates. Lebanese Christians serve ma'amoul with atar syrup for Easter, as well as a cake flavored with anise and mahlab.Sfouf is a popular sweet anise infused cake decorated with almonds Pastry shops in Tripoli offer baklava along with other local specialty pastries like halawet el jibn, filled with sweetened cheese and topped with atar, pistachios, clotted cream (ashta) and rose jam. Baklava is made of a layered pastry filled with nuts and steeped in attar syrup (orange or rose water and sugar), usually cut into a triangular or diamond shape when served, which is the particular style that originated in Lebanon. Znoud al-sit is a syrup-soaked rolled pastry filled with clotted cream and garnished in typical fashion with nuts, orange peels and dates to the 19th century.

It is generally used to differentiate between and identify white blood cells, malaria parasites, and trypanosomas. It is based on a methanolic mixture of \\"polychromed\\" methylene blue (i.e. demethylated into various azures) and eosin. The methanolic stock solution is stable and also serves the purpose of directly fixing the smear eliminating a prefixing step. If a working solution is made by dilution with an aqueous buffer, the resulting mixture is very unstable and cannot be used for long. Leishman stain is named after its inventor, the Scottish pathologist William Boog Leishman. It is a version of the Romanowsky stain, and is thus similar to and partially replaceable by Giemsa stain, Jenner's stain, and Wright's stain. Preparation and storage Many companies sell Leishman Stain in the form of a dry powder, which is later reconstituted with methanol.District Laboratory Practice in Tropical Countries, Part 2 By Monica Cheesbrough, Appendix I, Preparation of Reagents and Culture Media, p396 Heat and bright light oxidize the stain, and cause the precipitation of insoluble precipitates, such as methylene violet (Bernthsen) or Azure-Eosinate salts.District Laboratory Practice in Tropical Countries, Part 2 By Monica Cheesbrough, Section 8 Hematological Tests, subsection 8.7 Blood Films, p322 Advantages and disadvantages=Advantages According to Sir John Vivian Dacie's textbook, Practical Haematology, \\"Amongst the Romanowsky stains now in use, Jenner's is the simplest and Giemsa's the most complex. Leishman's stain, which occupies an intermediate position, is still widely used in the routine staining.\\" The WHO protocol Blood Safety and Clinical Technology Guidelines on Standard Operating Procedures for HAEMATOLOGY Chapter 11 - Preparation and Staining of Blood Films, (Last update: 27 April 2006) mentions: : Sir William Boog Leishman of London and Karl Reuter of Germany independently discovered in 1901 what is considered \\"Perhaps the most practical modifications of Malachowski‚Äôs stain\\"Biotech Histochem. 2011 Feb;86(1):7-35. The Color Purple: from Royalty to Laboratory, with Apologies to Malachowski. Krafts KP, Hempelmann E, Oleksyn BJ. They adopted the best aspects of the stains developed by Malachowski and Jenner, i.e., they used both polychromed methylene blue (accidentally done by Romanowsky who got the name, systematically done by Ernst Malachowski even before Romanowsky, and rediscovered by Bernhard Nocht, but unknown to Jenner, May, Grunwald and many others who used simple methylene blue) and filtering the Azure Eosinate precipitate from the aqueous mixture and redissolving in an alcoholic solvent (Jenner's wisdom). Differences between Leishman's and Reuter's methods were: Leishman used methanol (like Jenner) and substituted Eosin B for Eosin Y, whereas Reuter used ethyl alcohol and rightly stressed the importance of using an absolutely pure solvent. Both methods produced a stable stain and the desired purple color. =Good contrast= Leishman stain generally shows the brilliant violet color of the nucleus and the neutrophil granules for which differential count becomes convenient and makes the quality of staining better than the stains that are simple methylene blue and Eosin based which does not produce enough contrast between the cytoplasm and the nucleus. Since Leishman like other Romanowsky stains, stain cytoplasmic details and granules better hematologists generally prefer them (However see below about cytologists). Compared to the costly and toxic pure synthetic AZure B and Eosin Y based reagents used by the ICSH reference methods which are also not free from the disadvantage of getting oxidized and eventually giving grey tone instead of the optimal blue colors for cytoplasm, Leishman is a cheap easily available and easy to do technique which gives a fairly acceptable contrast. =Good sensitivity for malaria parasite= It has been documented that Leishman staining is more sensitive than Field's stain and as good as fluorescent stains for detection of malaria parasite.Indian Journal of Medical Microbiology, (2006) 24 (1):49-51 DisadvantagesDifficulty controlling molar ratio= Composition of polychromed methylene blue mixed with Eosin is never as good as the directly weighed and mixed proportions in Giemsa type stains. Albert Plehn in 1890Plehn F (1890b) Zur Aetiologie der Malaria. Berl. Klin. Wochenschr. 27: 292‚Äì294. had figured out that the molar ratio of basic to acidic dyes had to be increased from 2:1 to 3:1, however from Jenners time (1899) the use of the Azure Eosinate crystals brought the ratio back to the unsatisfactory 2:1 and the depth of color became less. It was only the work by Gustav Giemsa and the likes who again manually controlled the proportion of these two components that brought the depth of staining back. However Giemsa and others who artificially controlled the proportion sometimes went to the other extreme (a large molar excess of Azure up to a ratio of 16.1) which was probably unnecessary. per ICSH the optimal ratio is 6.5 to 7.3.ICSH reference method for staining of blood and bone marrow films by AZure B and Eosin Y (Romanowsky stain) INTERNATIONAL COMMITTEE FOR STANDARDIZATION IN HAEMATOLOGY Article first published online: 12 MAR 2008 DOI: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.1984.tb02949.x =Instability= The Leishman stain if reconstituted with buffer becomes very unstable (in contrast with Giemsa which is relatively more stable due to Glycerol, or the ICSH reference stains which use methanol+DMSO in 6:4 v/v ratio) and starts precipitating and needs repeated filtering. If not carefully supervised, water absorption, methanol evaporation from an opened container and the repeated filtering changes the composition and required frequent changing and makes this method wasteful. If not filtered, the precipitate deposits on the smear may be confused with platelets. It is important not to shake the bottle of stain before use, else settled precipitates would be resuspended and will deposit on films during staining and cause numerous artifacts and make microscopy very difficult. =Cytoplasmic contrast good but nuclear contrast not as good as H&E;= Like all other Malachowski- Romanowsky-Giemsa methods, it fades with time and cannot be stably archived for long. Also its above counterparts it stains the nuclei dark purple and the nuclear feature details are not as clear as Hematoxylene and Eosin, which are thus preferred by some cytopathologists. But that way it is a complementary method (since it stains cytoplasmic details granules etc. better than H&E; stain).

Olmsted wrote a series of reports suggesting a link between vaccination and autism, a hypothesis which has been disproven. His columns on health and medicine appeared regularly in The Washington Times and were syndicated nationally from UPI's Washington D.C. bureau. He owned and edited the Age of Autism website, a site he described as the \\"Daily Web Newspaper of the Autism Epidemic\\", where writers question the safety of vaccines. Olmsted wrote an article in 2002, along with reporter Mark Benjamin, which drew links between the drug Lariam given to military personnel and mental health disorders in soldiers. He co-wrote four books with Mark Blaxill, co-founder of Age of Autism. The last, Denial: How Refusing to Face the Facts about Our Autism Epidemic Hurts Children, Families, and Our Future was released posthumously in 2017. The Age of Autism From 2005 to July 2007, Olmsted wrote about his investigative findings concerning the apparent global epidemic of autism in a series of columns titled The Age of Autism. Though some scientific research suggests that autism is a primarily genetic disorder and that reported increases are mainly due to changes in diagnostic practices, Olmsted, claimed that the increases are due to mercury poisoning, particularly from vaccines, and that the genetics is mostly secondary. Though Olmsted continued to make this claim, thimerosal, the mercury-containing preservative blamed by Olmsted, was removed from most vaccines as a precaution beginning in the late 1990s, with no effect on autism diagnosis rates. Congressional action Citing Olmsted's reports, on March 30, 2006, Rep. Carolyn Maloney (NY) announced that she would be drafting legislation calling for scientific studies investigating thiomersal and autism, additional to the many already conducted.Carolyn Maloney (US congress page) - \\"New, Thorough Study of Possible Mercury-Autism Link Proposed By Rep. Maloney\\". PDF draft of legislation . The bill was introduced in the U. S. House of Representatives in April 2006. Maloney made the announcement at a National Press Club press conference in Washington, D.C., along with Olmsted and David Kirby.UPI.com - 'UPI Autism story prompts bill' (March 30, 2006) Criticism Scientific studies have found no credible evidence that thimerosal-containing vaccines and the MMR vaccine cause autism, and the MMR vaccine controversy is largely seen as the result of an \\"elaborate fraud\\" by British researcher Andrew Wakefield. In a critical assessment by the Columbia Journalism Review of the thimerosal controversy, Olmsted's reporting on unvaccinated populations has been characterized as \\"misguided\\" by two anonymous reporters.

U.S. release Shortly after its release in France in December 1994, Disney saw this film as a possibility to attract a family audience in the United States and considered giving it a limited release in select cities. Before releasing it in select cities, Disney decided to release it under their Touchstone Pictures label as they felt this film had some mature themes for an ordinary Disney film. As opposed to releasing it in the United States with subtitles leaving the original French dialogue in, Disney hired many cartoon voice-over actors to dub the original French dialogue out and substitute it with an English language format. They also gave the film an American name, Little Indian, Big City. Under its new Americanized title and language dubbing, Touchstone finally released it to a select American audience on March 22, 1996. Critical reception and box office Upon its original American release many American critics had an extremely harsh reaction to the film. Roger Ebert awarded Little Indian, Big City a rare \\"Zero Stars\\" rating and called it one of the worst films ever made claiming that he was annoyed by the awful dubbing as well as the writing and what he perceived as terrible humor. He ended his original Chicago Sun Times newspaper review by saying \\"If you under any circumstances see Little Indian, Big City, I will never let you read one of my reviews again\\". Ebert's colleague Gene Siskel also deplored the film saying that it was likely to be a candidate for the year's (or any year's) worst film. He also said that if the word for the film got big enough in the United States family audiences would have been \\"hoodwinked into paying to see a totally unprofessional movie.\\" When Siskel and Ebert viewed the film during its original theatrical release, one of the film reels broke out and the third reel of film was missing. A film executive informed Siskel and Ebert that they were allowed to come back the following week and view the particular reel. Siskel and Ebert came back to view the third reel, and by the time they had concluded viewing the whole film Siskel was quoted as saying, \\"If it was the legendary missing footage from The Magnificent Ambersons, this movie would still suck.\\" Both Siskel and Ebert later went on to claim this as one of the worst motion pictures they had ever seen (though it's not on Ebert's \\"Most Hated Films\\" list), and in January 1997, on Siskel and Ebert's \\"Worst of the Year\\" program for 1996, Ebert went on to call \\"Little Indian, Big City\\" the second worst film of the year, just behind Mad Dog Time. Peter Stack of the San Francisco Chronicle said that the dub \\"lends tackiness to an already inept comedy.\\"https://www.sfgate.com/entertainment/article/One-Little-Indian-Needs- a-Good-Laugh-Weak-2989603.php A critic from the rival San Francisco Examiner newspaper stated that \\"the real trouble with this movie is that it isn't even funny. As directed by Herve Palud and written by Palud and Igor Aptekman, it's a feathery thing that does not show off Lhermitte's considerable allure and gifts as a comic. In this movie, he looks like a dope whose mouth is moving in a distinctly French manner, inexplicably spouting the words of some uninspired American goof.\\"https://www.sfgate.com/news/article/Little-Indian-Big-City-can- be-dubbed-a-huge-3149040.php Janet Maslin of The New York Times further brutalized the production: \\"Whatever may have been funny - possibly nothing - about the popular French comedy [...] American audiences can watch it vanish before their eyes. This film has been dubbed into English so dreadfully that it becomes a discordant horror. Though the actors, including Thierry Lhermitte, Arielle Dombasle and Miou Miou, show faint visual signs of gentleness and civility, they now have now become crassly Americanized boors on the film's painful audio track.\\"https://archive.nytimes.com/www.nytimes.com/library/filmarchive/little_indian.html James Berardinelli opened his review with a paragraph which read, \\"Little Indian, Big City, the American name given to Herve Palud's 1995 French fish- out-of-water comedy, L'Indian dans la Ville, is easily one of the most tedious viewing experiences of 1996. I came as close to walking out of this movie as anything I have ever watched. No one, no matter how desperate they are for family entertainment, should be subjected to the indignity of sitting through this ninety-minute excuse for a motion picture.\\"http://www.reelviews.net/reelviews/little-indian-big-city As of today, Rotten Tomatoes gives this film a score of 13% based on 8 reviews.

He successively became minister in Foudgum, Den Helder and Schiedam. During his student days, he had some of his poetry published in student magazines under the pen name of Piet Paaltjens, around whom a playful but elaborate mystification was created as Haverschmidt kept his poetry separate from his \\"serious\\" prose and sermons, not unlike Nicolaas Beets. He became a prime suspect for being the anonymous author of the Oera Linda Book \`Paaltjens schrijver Oera Linda' , the inferred reason being a practical joke Het Oera Linda boek was een grap (a parody of the Bible to lampoon fundamentalist Christians) Het Oera Linda-boek ‚Äì Aanklacht tegen christelijk fundamentalisme. However, many of his contemporaries believed the book to be authentic. This would have prevented Haverschmidt and his collaborators (if they were indeed the authors of the supposedly millennia-old text) from unmasking their hoax, which consequently completely backfired. Haverschmidt became progressively more depressed, especially after his wife's death in 1891, and ultimately committed suicide in 1894.

The dolls are still functional, and can be seen at the Mus√©e d'Art et d'Histoire of Neuch√¢tel, in Switzerland. They are considered to be among the remote ancestors of modern computers. The automata were designed and built by Pierre Jaquet-Droz, Henri-Louis Jaquet-Droz and Jean-Fr√©d√©ric Leschot as advertisement and entertainment toys designed to improve the sales of watches among the nobility of Europe in the 18th century. They were carried around, and lost at several points. The History and Archeology society of Neuch√¢tel eventually bought them in 1906, for 75,000 gold francs, and gave them to the museum.  The musician  The musician The musician is modelled as a female organ player. The music is not recorded or played by a musical box: the doll plays a genuine, custom-built instrument by pressing the keys with her fingers. Movements of her chest show her \\"breathing\\", and she follows her fingers with her head and eyes. The automaton also makes some of the movements that a real player would do, such as balancing the torso.  The draughtsman  The draughtsman Two of the drawings that can be made by the draughtsman The draughtsman is modelled as a young child, and is capable of drawing four different images: a portrait of Louis XV, a royal couple (believed to be Marie Antoinette and Louis XVI), a dog with \\"Mon toutou\\" (\\"my doggy\\") written beside it, and a scene of Cupid driving a chariot pulled by a butterfly. The draughtsman works by using a system of cams that code the movements of the hand in two dimensions, plus one to lift the pencil. The automaton also moves on his chair, and he periodically blows on the pencil to remove dust.  The writer  The writer The writer is the most complex of the three automata. Using a system similar to the one used for the draughtsman for each letter, he is able to write any custom text up to 40 letters long (the text is rarely changed; one of the latest instances was in honour of president Fran√ßois Mitterrand when he toured the city). The text is coded on a wheel where characters are selected one by one. He uses a goose feather to write, which he inks from time to time, including a shake of the wrist to prevent ink from spilling. His eyes follow the text being written, and his head moves when he takes some ink. The writer is tall.

She is best known as the creator of a method for learning in groups called theme-centered interaction (TCI). She was the founder of the Workshop Institute for Living Learning (WILL), which is known today as the Ruth Cohn Institute for TCI. Early life Ruth Cohn was born as the second child of an assimilated Jewish family in Berlin. Her father, Arthur Hirschfeld, was a banker, her mother Elisabeth, a pianist, came from a merchant family. In 1931/32 she studied economics and psychology at the Universities of Heidelberg and Berlin. When Hitler came to power in 1933, after disturbing and frightening experiences with National SocialismFriedemann Schulz von Thun: Nachruf f√ºr Ruth Cohn she fled to Zurich, Switzerland, where she studied psychology and minored in pre- clinical medicine and psychiatrics at the University. In addition, she studied education, theology, literature and philosophy. From 1934 to 1939, she was also trained as a psychoanalyst at the International Society for Psychoanalysis. In 1936, she ‚Äî like all German Jews living in foreign countries ‚Äî lost her German citizenship. In 1938, she married Hans-Helmut Cohn, a medical student of German-Jewish heritage.Gary A. Tollmann: Ruth C. Cohn (1912 - 2010), in: American Psychologist Vol. 65 (9) 926 (2010)\\"TZI: P√§dagogisch-therapeutische Gruppenarbeit nach Ruth C. Cohn\\", herausgegeben von Cornelia L√∂hmer und R√ºdiger Stadhardt, Verlag Klett-Cotta, 1992, pp. 447 - 450 In 1940, her daughter Heidi Ursula was born. The following year, the family emigrated to the United States. There, she was trained in Early Childhood Progressive Education at the Bank Street School (now Bank Street College of Education) in New York City. From 1941 to 1944, she was trained as a psychotherapist at the William Alanson White Institute of Psychiatry, Psychoanalysis & Psychology in New York. At Columbia University, she earned her Master's degree (M.A.) in psychology, and she became certified as a psychologist. Her son Peter Ronald was born in 1944. Her grandson Eric Bert Weiner was born in 1971. Her granddaughter Elizabeth Emily Weiner was born in 1975. In 1946, after being divorced, she moved with both children to New Jersey and she started a private psychoanalytical practice in New York City. Not least by her training in group therapy, she was gradually led away from classical psychoanalysis in the direction of experiential psychotherapy. In 1955, she initiated a workshop with the theme \\"Countertransference\\" whose methodical approach formed the basis for the development of experiential therapy and theme-centered interaction (TCI). Theme-Centered Interaction There were two aspects that led to the creation of TCI: Firstly, \\"the couch was too small\\"! The couch of psychoanalysis was only for one person at a time. Should it not be possible to serve the progress of humanism in marriage, in school, in politics, in the working life by means of psychology, psychotherapy and pedagogics? The couch was too small: the group was needed. Secondly, Ruth Cohn was dissatisfied with her finding that therapeutical groups were so full of human encounters and experiences, wereas the life in class rooms was so academic, so abstract. It should be possible to form and lead learning and work groups in such a way that there would be some activation by lively dialogue, some self-determination, some personal engagement. The answer was TCI. At the beginning of 1960s Ruth Cohn worked in commercial enterprises using TCI for the first time. From 1965 to 1966, she was trained in gestalt therapy by Fritz Perls. She founded the Workshop Institute for Living Learning (WILL) 1966 in New York and in 1972 in Switzerland, an institute for training and research in theme-centered interaction. Later years After having been invited to European congresses many times, she finally closed her private practice in the USA, and in 1974, she returned to Europe and went to live in Hasliberg-Goldern (Switzerland) where she consulted for the Ecole d'Humanit√© until 1998. She also opened a private practice and worked as a TCI teacher. From 1994 on, she lived on the Hasliberg only in the summer months, but otherwise with her friend and WILL graduate, Helga Hermann, in D√ºsseldorf (Germany). She died in D√ºsseldorf.  Achievements  Ruth leaves behind a well-established organization, the Ruth Cohn Institute for TCI International, with headquarters in Basel, Switzerland. Her life and work have influenced the lives and work of many others on several continents, but most of her publications are in German. She is survived by her son Peter who lives in Denver, Colorado, and by her grandson Eric in Providence, and granddaughter Elizabeth in New York.

The film is a sequel to the popular Fast Getaway, released in 1991. Plot Nelson Potter, now retired from bank robbing, runs an insurance business in Tucson, Arizona with his partner Patrice. Their job is to evaluate security measures at local banks by staging armed robberies. After one such drill, Nelson is confronted and assaulted by a shady FBI agent named Ranken. Later that night, Lilly (a vengeful ex-partner from Nelson's bank robbing days) arrives at the same bank. Faking a flat tire, she tricks the two janitors into opening the door and incapacitates them before sending two of her own men into the bank to carry out the robbery. The next morning, Nelson receives a call notifying him of the breach. However, Patrice gets fed up with his immaturity and womanizing and quits the business, despite having a crush on him. At the bank, Nelson learns that no money was taken, but instead the thieves were after the contents of a safe deposit box. Nelson brings surveillance photos from the break-in to his father Sam in prison, who quickly identifies Lilly as the culprit. Meanwhile, Agent Ranken shows up at Nelson's house and confronts Patrice. He alleges that Nelson is nothing more than a common criminal, who only escaped justice because his father made a deal with the District Attorney. He also reveals that three of the five banks she and Nelson evaluated for security had been robbed afterwards, and suspects Nelson is responsible. He then manhandles Patrice and threatens her with prosecution if she is involved. Lilly stages a medical emergency at another bank in order to steal a key to the front door. That night, a drunken Nelson returns home from a date to find a burglar lurking within. He chases the man outside, only to be knocked out by Lilly. She then enters the bank with her cohorts and gains access to the vault, where she plants a pocketknife taken from Nelson's home to incriminate him. Nelson calls Patrice over to his house and the two make amends. While watching his own security footage, Nelson witnesses the encounter between her and Agent Ranken, just before Ranken arrives to arrest him. Nelson flees with Ranken in pursuit, but he eventually manages to get away. At the prison, Sam watches a news broadcast implicating Nelson in the robberies. With the help of Lilly's old partner Tony, Sam escapes the prison and sneaks into Nelson's house, where he runs into Patrice. The two leave together, unaware that Ranken is tailing them. They reunite with Nelson at a laundromat, where Sam reveals Lilly's scheme to replace old money to be taken out of circulation with counterfeit bills. When Ranken arrives, Sam and Nelson barely avoid being captured; Patrice surrenders herself in their stead. With the help of a colleague, she tracks Nelson to the bank where Lilly is predicted to strike next. Lilly takes Nelson, Sam, and Patrice captive while she robs the bank, but an exploding bundle of money triggers the fire alarm causing everyone to flee. Lilly takes Patrice hostage while Sam and Nelson give chase. When a psychotic Ranken shows up with a grenade launcher, Sam distracts him long enough for Nelson to catch up with Lilly and rescue Patrice. Early the next day, Sam returns to prison just in time for the morning roll call, having smuggled in a bag of money from the previous night's robbery. Outside, Nelson and Patrice share a kiss and discuss renewing their partnership before driving away together. Production notes The film was shot in Tucson, Arizona and features a 1994 Mazda RX7 as his getaway car.

Bankable stars are rare, with there being only about twelve at any point in time. Hiring a bankable star helps a film company to secure investment, secure distribution, and garner media attention. Some bankable stars have so much star power that even films without a strong concept or \\"hook\\", such as a star vehicle film, is feasible to make. A bankable director is a similar notion. Brad Pitt, Margot Robbie, and Leonardo DiCaprio are examples of \\"bankable stars\\".  Overview  Media consultant Blake Harris states that a bankable star is one of the \\"3 minimum ingredients to any film package.\\" the other two being a successful director and a script or a strong story idea. The involvement of a bankable star in a film gives investors confidence that they will achieve a return on their investments by ensuring that the film is widely distributed and that at least some people will pay to see it (that it will \\"open\\"). Harris adds that obtaining a bankable star for a package is not easy because of the dearth of such stars. He states that at any point in time there are no more than \\"a dozen or so\\" stars whose mere involvement will ensure that a film will be made. Analyst Alex Epstein states that bankable stars or, more generally, \\"bankable elements\\" are how \\"hookless\\" films (films without a compelling concept that makes people interested in them in their own right) get made. He gives Dances with Wolves as an example of a movie: the involvement of Kevin Costner as the bankable star guaranteed that the movie was made. Writer Melissa Robbie concurs, stating that some movies are high-concept (they have what Epstein terms \\"hooks\\"), but others are simply star vehicles for bankable stars. The Hollywood Reporter has published several results of polls for Hollywood's top ten most bankable stars, the most recent three being one in 1999, one in 2002 and the last one in 2006. The 2002 survey polled \\"114 executives at both major studios and independent companies, financiers and various industry players from around the world.\\" Voters were asked which stars \\"did the most to attract financing to a film, ensure its global distribution, and deliver that hugely important opening weekend based on the strength of their good name.\\" James Ulmer has compared his list of bankable stars, The Ulmer Scale, to a stock market index. His criteria for ranking is based on the name of a star alone being able to get people to movie theaters in the United States as well as the rest of the world. In an August 2010 interview Ulmer described the international movie market as \\"unfortunately ... pretty sexist\\"; how a woman's name alone cannot sell a movie, and how female stars are only bankable when cast with a male star or in ensemble movies.

Heating devices, such as a microwave oven, although of similar design, are not usually called transmitters, in that they use the electromagnetic energy locally rather than transmitting it to another location. Design issues A radio transmitter design has to meet certain requirements. These include the frequency of operation, the type of modulation, the stability and purity of the resulting signal, the efficiency of power use, and the power level required to meet the system design objectives.Rudolf F. Graf, William Sheets, Build Your Own Low- Power Transmitters: Projects for the Electronics Experimenter Newnes, 2001 , page 2 High-power transmitters may have additional constraints with respect to radiation safety, generation of X-rays, and protection from high voltages.Ronald Kitchen, RF Radiation Safety Handbook, Butterworth Heinemann 1993, Chapter 10 Typically a transmitter design includes generation of a carrier signal, which is normallysome spread spectrum systems use pulses or sets of orthogonal wave forms sinusoidal, optionally one or more frequency multiplication stages, a modulator, a power amplifier, and a filter and matching network to connect to an antenna. A very simple transmitter might contain only a continuously running oscillator coupled to some antenna system. More elaborate transmitters allow better control over the modulation of the emitted signal and improve the stability of the transmitted frequency. For example, the Master Oscillator-Power Amplifier (MOPA) configuration inserts an amplifier stage between the oscillator and the antenna. This prevents changes in the loading presented by the antenna from altering the frequency of the oscillator.Joseph J. Carr Microwave and Wireless Communication Technology, Newnes, 1997 page 339-341 Determining the frequency=Fixed frequency systems For a fixed frequency transmitter one commonly used method is to use a resonant quartz crystal in a Crystal oscillator to fix the frequency. Where the frequency has to be variable, several options can be used. Variable frequency systems * An array of crystals ‚Äì used to enable a transmitter to be used on several different frequencies; rather than being a truly variable frequency system, it is a system which is fixed to several different frequencies (a subset of the above). * Variable-frequency oscillator (VFO) * Phase-locked loop frequency synthesiser * Direct digital synthesis Frequency multiplication {align=right Frequency doubler A push-push frequency doubler. The output is tuned to two times the input frequency. Frequency tripler A push-pull frequency tripler. The output is tuned to three times the input frequency. } While modern frequency synthesizers can output a clean stable signal up through UHF, for many years, especially at higher frequencies, it was not practical to operate the oscillator at the final output frequency. For better frequency stability, it was common to multiply the frequency of the oscillator up to the final, required frequency. This was accommodated by allocating the short wave amateur and marine bands in harmonically related frequencies such as 3.5, 7, 14 and 28 MHz. Thus one crystal or VFO could cover several bands. In simple equipment this approach is still used occasionally. If the output of an amplifier stage is simply tuned to a multiple of the frequency with which the stage is driven, the stage will give a large harmonic output. Many transmitters have used this simple approach successfully. However these more complex circuits will do a better job. In a push-push stage, the output will only contain even harmonics. This is because the currents which would generate the fundamental and the odd harmonics in this circuit are canceled by the second device. In a push-pull stage, the output will contain only odd harmonics because of the canceling effect. Adding modulation to the signal The task of a transmitter is to convey some form of information using a radio signal (carrier wave) which has been modulated to carry the intelligence. The RF generator in a microwave oven, electrosurgery, and induction heating are similar in design to transmitters, but usually not considered as such in that they do not intentionally produce a signal that will travel to a distant point. Such RF devices are required by law to operate in an ISM band where interference to radio communications will not occur. Where communications is the object, one or more of the following methods of incorporating the desired signal into the radio wave is used. AM modes When the amplitude of a radio frequency wave is varied in amplitude in a manner which follows the modulating signal, usually voice, video or data, we have Amplitude modulation (AM). = Low level and high level = In low level modulation a small audio stage is used to modulate a low power stage. The output of this stage is then amplified using a linear RF amplifier. The great disadvantage of this system is that the amplifier chain is less efficient, because it has to be linear to preserve the modulation. Hence high efficiency class C amplifiers cannot be employed, unless a Doherty amplifier, EER (Envelope Elimination and Restoration) or other methods of predistortion or negative feedback are used. High level modulation uses class C amplifiers in a broadcast AM transmitter and only the final stage or final two stages are modulated, and all the earlier stages can be driven at a constant level. When modulation is applied to the plate of the final tube, a large audio amplifier is needed for the modulation stage, equal to 1/2 of the DC input power of the modulated stage. Traditionally the modulation is applied using a large audio transformer. However many different circuits have been used for high level AM modulation. See Amplitude Modulation. =Types of AM modulators= A wide range of different circuits have been used for AM. While it is perfectly possible to create good designs using solid-state electronics, valved (tube) circuits are shown here. In general, valves are able to easily yield RF powers far in excess of what can be achieved using solid state. Most high-power broadcast stations below 3 MHz use solid state circuits, but higher power stations above 3 MHz still use valves. Plate AM modulators Anode modulation using a transformer. The valve anode sees the vector sum of anode volts and audio voltage. PWM switching for high efficiency. Historically the series regulator would have been a tube in analog mode. High level plate modulation consists of varying the voltage on the plate (anode) of the valve so that it swings from nearly zero to double the resting value. This will produce 100% modulation and can be done by inserting a transformer in series with the high voltage supply to the anode so that the vector sum of the two sources, (DC and audio) will be applied. A disadvantage is the size, weight and cost of the transformer as well as its limited audio frequency response, especially for very powerful transmitters. Alternatively a series regulator can be inserted between the DC supply and the anode. The DC supply provides twice the normal voltage the anode sees. The regulator can allow none or all of the voltage to pass, or any intermediate value. The audio input operates the regulator in such a way as to produce the instantaneous anode voltage needed to reproduce the modulation envelope. An advantage of the series regulator is that it can set the anode voltage to any desired value. Thus the power output of the transmitter can be easily adjusted, allowing the use of Dynamic Carrier Control. The use of PDM switching regulators makes this system very efficient, whereas the original analog regulators were very inefficient and also non linear. Series PDM modulators are used in solid state transmitters also, but the circuits are somewhat more complex, using push pull or bridge circuits for the RF section. These simplified diagrams omit such details as filament, screen and grid bias supplies, and the screen and cathode connections to RF ground. Screen AM modulators Screen AM modulator. Grid bias not shown Under carrier conditions (no audio) the stage will be a simple RF amplifier where the screen voltage is set lower than normal to limit the RF output to about 25% of full power. When the stage is modulated the screen potential changes and so alters the gain of the stage. It takes much less audio power to modulate the screen, but final stage efficiency is only about 40%, compared to 80% with plate modulation. For this reason screen modulation was used only in low power transmitters and is now effectively obsolete. AM related modes Several derivatives of AM are in common use. These are =Single-sideband modulation= SSB, or SSB-AM single-sideband full carrier modulation, is very similar to single-sideband suppressed carrier modulation (SSB-SC). It is used where it is necessary to receive the audio on an AM receiver, while using less bandwidth than with double sideband AM. Due to high distortion, it is seldom used. Either SSB-AM or SSB-SC are produced by the following methods. Filter method Using a balanced mixer a double side band signal is generated, this is then passed through a very narrow bandpass filter to leave only one side-band.Pappenfus, Bruene and Schoenike Single sideband principles and circuits McGraw-Hill, 1964, chapter 6 By convention it is normal to use the upper sideband (USB) in communication systems, except for amateur radio when the carrier frequency is below 10 MHz. There the lower side band (LSB) is normally used. Phasing method Phasing method of SSB generation The phasing method for the generation of single sideband signals uses a network which imposes a constant 90¬∞ phase shift on audio signals over the audio range of interest. This was difficult with analog methods but with DSP is very simple. These audio outputs are each mixed in a linear balanced mixer with a carrier. The carrier drive for one of these mixers is also shifted by 90¬∞. The outputs of these mixers are added in a linear circuit to give the SSB signal by phase cancellation of one of the sidebands. Connecting the 90¬∞ delayed signal from either the audio or the carrier (but not both) to the other mixer will reverse the sideband, so either USB or LSB is available with a simple DPDT switch. =Vestigial-sideband modulation= Vestigial-sideband modulation (VSB, or VSB-AM) is a type of modulation system commonly used in analogue TV systems. It is normal AM which has been passed through a filter which reduces one of the sidebands. Typically, components of the lower sideband more than 0.75 MHz or 1.25 MHz below the carrier will be heavily attenuated. Morse Morse code is usually sent using on-off keying of an unmodulated carrier (Continuous wave). No special modulator is required. This interrupted carrier may be analyzed as an AM-modulated carrier. On-off keying produces sidebands, as expected, but they are referred to as \\"key-clicks\\". Shaping circuits are used to turn the transmitter on and off smoothly instead of instantly in order to limit the bandwidth of these sidebands and reduce interference to adjacent channels. FM modes Angle modulation is the proper term for modulation by changing the instantaneous frequency or phase of the carrier signal. True FM and phase modulation are the most commonly employed forms of analogue angle modulation. =Direct FM= Direct FM (true Frequency modulation) is where the frequency of an oscillator is altered to impose the modulation upon the carrier wave. This can be done by using a voltage-controlled capacitor (Varicap diode) in a crystal-controlled oscillator or frequency synthesiser. The frequency of the oscillator is then multiplied up using a frequency multiplier stage, or is translated upwards using a mixing stage, to the output frequency of the transmitter. The amount of modulation is referred to as the deviation, being the amount that the frequency of the carrier instantaneously deviates from the centre carrier frequency. =Indirect FM= Indirect FM solid state circuit. Indirect FM employs a varicap diode to impose a phase shift (which is voltage- controlled) in a tuned circuit that is fed with a plain carrier. This is termed phase modulation. In some indirect FM solid state circuits, an RF drive is applied to the base of a transistor. The tank circuit (LC), connected to the collector via a capacitor, contains a pair of varicap diodes. As the voltage applied to the varicaps is changed, the phase shift of the output will change. Phase modulation is mathematically equivalent to direct Frequency modulation with a 6 dB/octave high-pass filter applied to the modulating signal. This high-pass effect can be exploited or compensated for using suitable frequency-shaping circuitry in the audio stages ahead of the modulator. For example, many FM systems will employ pre-emphasis and de- emphasis for noise reduction, in which case the high-pass equivalency of phase modulation automatically provides for the pre-emphasis. Phase modulators are typically only capable of relatively small amounts of deviation while remaining linear, but any frequency multiplier stages also multiply the deviation in proportion. Digital modes Transmission of digital data is becoming more and more important. Digital information can be transmitted by AM and FM modulation, but often digital modulation consists of complex forms of modulation using aspects of both AM and FM. COFDM is used for DRM broadcasts. The transmitted signal consists of multiple carriers each modulated in both amplitude and phase. This allows very high bit rates and makes very efficient use of bandwidth. Digital or pulse methods also are used to transmit voice as in cell phones, or video as in terrestrial TV broadcasting. Early text messaging such as RTTY allowed the use of class C amplifiers, but modern digital modes require linear amplification. See also Sigma-delta modulation (‚àëŒî) =Amplifying the signal=Valves= For high power, high frequency systems it is normal to use valves, see Valve RF amplifier for details of how valved RF power stages work. Valves are electrically very robust, they can tolerate overloads which would destroy bipolar transistor systems in milliseconds. As a result, valved amplifiers may resist mistuning, lightning and power surges better. However, they require a heated cathode which consumes power and will fail in time due to loss of emission or heater burn out. The high voltages associated with valve circuits are dangerous to persons. For economic reasons, valves continue to be used for the final power amplifier for transmitters operating above 1.8 MHz and with powers above about 500 watts for amateur use and above about 10 kW for broadcast use. Solid state Solid state devices, either discrete transistors or integrated circuits, are universally used for new transmitter designs up to a few hundred watts. The lower level stages of more powerful transmitters are also all solid state. Transistors can be used at all frequencies and power levels, but since the output of individual devices is limited, higher power transmitters must use many transistors in parallel, and the cost of the devices and the necessary combining networks can be excessive. As new transistor types become available and the price drops, solid state may eventually replace all valve amplifiers. Linking the transmitter to the aerial The majority of modern transmitting equipment is designed to operate with a resistive load fed via coaxial cable of a particular characteristic impedance, often 50 ohms. To connect the power stage of the transmitter to this coaxial cable transmission line a matching network is required. For solid state transmitters this is typically a broadband transformer which steps up the low impedance of the output devices to 50 ohms. A tube transmitter will contain a tuned output network, most commonly a PI network, that steps the load impedance which the tube requires down to 50 ohms. In each case the power producing devices will not transfer power efficiently if the network is detuned or badly designed or if the antenna presents other than 50 ohms at the transmitter output. Commonly an SWR meter and/or directional wattmeter are used to check the extent of the match between the aerial system and the transmitter via the transmission line (feeder). A directional wattmeter indicates forward power, reflected power, and often SWR as well. Each transmitter will specify a maximum allowable mismatch based on efficiency, distortion, and possible damage to the transmitter. Many transmitters have automatic circuits to reduce power or shut down if this value is exceeded. Transmitters feeding a balanced transmission line will need a balun. This transforms the single ended output of the transmitter to a higher impedance balanced output. High power short wave transmission systems typically use 300 ohm balanced lines between the transmitter and antenna. Amateurs often use 300‚Äì450 ohm balanced antenna feeders. See Antenna tuner and balun for details of matching networks and baluns respectively. EMC matters Many devices depend on the transmission and reception of radio waves for their operation. The possibility for mutual interference is great. Many devices not intended to transmit signals may do so. For instance a dielectric heater might contain a 2000 watt 27 MHz source within it. If the machine operates as intended then none of this RF power will leak out. However, if due to poor design or maintenance it allows RF to leak out, it will become a transmitter or unintentional radiator. RF leakage & shielding All equipment using RF electronics should be inside a screened conductive box and all connections in or out of the box should be filtered to avoid the passage of radio signals. A common and effective method of doing so for wires carrying DC supplies, 50/60 Hz AC connections, audio and control signals is to use a feedthrough capacitor, whose job is to short circuit any RF on the wire to ground. The use of ferrite beads is also common. If an intentional transmitter produces interference, then it should be run into a dummy load; this is a resistor in a screened box or can which will allow the transmitter to generate radio signals without sending them to the antenna. If the transmitter continues to cause interference during this test then a path exists by which RF power is leaking out of the equipment and this can be due to bad shielding. Such leakage is most likely to occur on homemade equipment or equipment that has been modified or had covers removed. RF leakage from microwave ovens, while rare, may occur due to defective door seals, and may be a health hazard. Spurious emissions Early in the development of radio technology it was recognized that the signals emitted by transmitters had to be 'pure'. Spark-gap transmitters were outlawed once better technology was available as they give an output which is very wide in terms of frequency. The term spurious emissions refers to any signal which comes out of a transmitter other than the wanted signal. In modern equipment there are three main types of spurious emissions: harmonics, out of band mixer products which are not fully suppressed and leakage from the local oscillator and other systems within the transmitter. =Harmonics= These are multiples of the operation frequency of the transmitter, they can be generated in any stage of the transmitter which is not perfectly linear and must be removed by filtering. Avoiding harmonic generation {align=right This push pull wide band amplifier uses ferrite core transformers for matching and coupling. The two NPN transistors can be biased to class A, AB or C, and will still have very weak harmonics at even multiples of the design frequency. The odd harmonics will be stronger, but still manageable. Class C will have the most harmonics. This single ended amplifier uses a narrowly tuned anode circuit to reduce harmonics when operating class AB or C. } The difficulty of removing harmonics from an amplifier will depend on the design. A push-pull amplifier will have fewer harmonics than a single ended circuit. A class A amplifier will have very few harmonics, class AB or B more, and class C the most. In the typical class C amplifier, the resonant tank circuit will remove most of the harmonics, but in either of these examples, a low pass filter will likely be needed following the amplifier. Removal of harmonics with filters A simple low pass filter suitable for harmonic reduction. In addition to the good design of the amplifier stages, the transmitter's output should be filtered with a low-pass filter to reduce the level of the harmonics. Typically the input and output are interchangeable and match to 50 ohms. Inductance and capacity values will vary with frequency. Many transmitters switch in a suitable filter for the frequency band being used. The filter will pass the desired frequency and reduce all harmonics to acceptable levels. The harmonic output of a transmitter is best checked using an RF spectrum analyzer or by tuning a receiver to the various harmonics. If a harmonic falls on a frequency being used by another communications service then this spurious emission can prevent an important signal from being received. Sometimes additional filtering is used to protect a sensitive range of frequencies, for example, frequencies used by aircraft or services involved with protection of life and property. Even if a harmonic is within the legally allowed limits, the harmonic should be further reduced. =Oscillators and mix products= Simple but poor mixer. A diode is shown but any non-linear device can be used.A double balanced mixer using matched diodes. It is also possible to use active devices such as transistors or valves.When mixing signals to produce a desired output frequency, the choice of Intermediate frequency and local oscillator is important. If poorly chosen, a spurious output can be generated. For example, if 50 MHz is mixed with 94 MHz to produce an output on 144 MHz, the third harmonic of the 50 MHz may appear in the output. This problem is similar to the Image response problem which exists in receivers. One method of reducing the potential for this transmitter defect is the use of balanced and double balanced mixers. A simple mixer will pass both of the input frequencies and all of their harmonics along with the sum and difference frequencies. If the simple mixer is replaced with a balanced mixer then the number of possible products is reduced. If the frequency mixer has fewer outputs the task of making sure that the final output is clean will be simpler. =Instability and parasitics= If a stage in a transmitter is unstable and is able to oscillate then it can start to generate RF at either a frequency close to the operating frequency or at a very different frequency. One good sign that it is occurring is if an RF stage has a power output even without being driven by an exciting stage. Output power should increase smoothly as input power is increased, although with Class C, there will be a noticeable threshold effect. Various circuits are used for parasitic suppression in a good design. Proper neutralization is also important. Control and protection Yaesu FT-817 Transceiver controls One button and two knobs allow control of 52 separate parameters. The simplest transmitters such as RFID devices require no external controls. Simple tracking transmitters may have only an on-off switch. Many transmitters must have circuits that allow them to be turned on and off and the power output and frequency adjusted or modulation levels adjusted. Many modern multi-featured transmitters allow the adjustment of many different parameters. Usually these are under microprocessor control via multilevel menus, thus reducing the required number of physical knobs. Often a display screen provides feedback to the operator to assist in adjustments. The user friendliness of this interface will often be one of the main factors in a successful design. Microprocessor controlled transmitters also may include software to prevent off frequency or other illegal operation. Transmitters using significant power or expensive components must also have protection circuits which prevent such things as overload, overheating or other abuse of the circuits. Overload circuits may include mechanical relays, or electronic circuits. Simple fuses may be included to protect expensive components. Arc detectors may shut off the transmitter when sparks or fires occur. Protection features must also prevent the human operator and the public from encountering the high voltages and power which exist inside the transmitter. Tube transmitters typically use DC voltages between 600 and 30,000 volts, which are deadly if contacted. Radio frequency power above about 10 watts can cause burning of human tissue through contact and higher power can actually cook human flesh without contact. Metal shielding is required to isolate these dangers. Properly designed transmitters have doors or panels which are interlocked, so that open doors activate switches which do not allow the transmitter to be turned on when the dangerous areas are exposed. In addition, either resistors which bleed off the high voltages or shorting relays are employed to insure that capacitors do not retain a dangerous charge after turn off. With large high power transmitters, the protective circuits can comprise a significant fraction of the total design complexity and cost. Power supplies Some RFID devices take power from an external source when it interrogates the device, but most transmitters either have self-contained batteries, or are mobile systems which typically operate directly from the 12 volt vehicle battery. Larger fixed transmitters will require power from the mains. The voltages used by a transmitter will be AC and DC of many different values. Either AC transformers or DC power supplies are required to provide the values of voltage and current needed to operate the various circuits. Some of these voltages will need to be regulated. Thus a significant part of the total design will consist of power supplies. Power supplies will be integrated into the control and protection systems of the transmitter, which will turn them on in the proper sequence and protect them from overloads. Often rather complicated logic systems will be required for these functions.

History  Rickard was previously a member of early Goa group Subcouds and at around the same time Robert had started musical production on an Amiga. After meeting through Rickard's younger cousin, the pair decided to start studio recordings in June 1998 with the creation of Vibrasphere. Robert decided to quit the group half a year after the release of their second album, Lime Structure, due to constant touring. Rickard continued both touring and studio recording. In 2005 Robert decided to rejoin the group, leaving Rickard still in charge of touring duties. Their fourth album, Exploring the Tributaries (2007), took a few more leaps towards progressive, fading the barriers between trance and house music while also featuring dub, downbeat and ambient tracks. In November 2010, Vibrasphere announced it was disbanding. The group's website stated \\"We are very sorry to inform you that we have decided to close down the Vibrasphere project.

History Located at the border between the Bruntsfield and Tollcross areas of the city at the junction of Barclay Place and Wright's Houses, it was designed by Frederick Thomas Pilkington (1832‚Äì98) - starting in 1862 and completed in 1864 - mainly from a bequest of ¬£10,000The Three Great Roads, Drew Easton left by Miss Mary Barclay of Carlton TerraceEdinburgh Post Office Directory 1850 for the building of a church for the Free Church of Scotland. The first minister of the congregation was Rev Dr James Hood Wilson, DD, the first service of public worship being held on 23 December 1864. He served as Moderator of the General Assembly of the Free Church of Scotland in 1895. Wilson was replaced by Rev Dr William Macallum Clow in 1897.Ewing, William Annals of the Free Church The church remained part of the Free Church of Scotland until 1900 when the majority of the Free Church and the United Presbyterian Church of Scotland united to form the United Free Church of Scotland, and subsequently joined the Church of Scotland in 1929 when the majority of the United Free Church joined the Church of Scotland. Barclay Church united with Bruntsfield Church (Leamington Terrace) in 1965. The Bruntsfield Church building is now used by an independent church and is known as Bruntsfield Evangelical Church. The church was renamed as \\"Barclay-Bruntsfield Church\\" until 1980 when it reverted to its original name after united with Chalmers-Lauriston Church (59-61 Lauriston Place). Chalmers-Lauriston Church was purchased by the City of Edinburgh Council and sold to the Arab Social League for use as a cultural centre, but has remained derelict. Barclay united with Viewforth Church in 2009. Other churches which have been subsumed into the parish of Barclay Viewforth through earlier unions include West Port Church. It is currently in a Parish Grouping with St Catherine's-Argyle Parish Church in Marchmont. Architecture The Church, along with the Halls and Church Officer's House at the rear, are category A listed by Historic Scotland. The spire, which at high is a landmark in the city skyline, is one of the tallest church spires in Edinburgh. Internally, the church has seating on the ground floor with two tiers of galleries in the heart shaped auditorium, which originally had seating for 1,200. The organ was installed in 1896 by R. Hope-Jones and has been twice rebuilt. The marble pulpit (also by Pilkington) holds a prominent location under the organ pipes with a central view over the nave.

The territory of the municipality lies between above sea level. Demographics Copparo has a population of about 17,000 inhabitants (Copparesi) and a surface of ; thus the population density is 111.2 inhabitants per square kilometer. History The origins of Copparo date back to the early Middle Ages and are confirmed both by a formation prior to the year 1000 and by its belonging to the Church of Ferrara and Ravenna (955) under the name \\"Massa in Copario\\". From many historical documents it appears that Copparo was a rather large agricultural center within the territory of Ferrara. The 1431 census mentions it as the largest area sown with barley and wheat. Copparo was likewise mentioned in the Statuta Ferrariae dated 1287 under the name of \\"Coparius\\" (recalling the responsibility the citizens of Copparo had in digging the\\"de preta\\" channel). After the year 1251, the area fell under the title of the Dukes of Ferrara, the Estensi family. They used the area primarily for recreational purposes, developing one of their principle game preserves and hunting lodges, a turreted castle. It was destroyed during the war against Venice and rebuilt in 1540. It then became one of the most famous Estense Delights. Of the original structure and its five towers only a solitary one remains today, on the site of the current city hall. Cuisine Copparo's cuisine has both simple and sophisticated dishes, being a combination of the tastes of the Estense's noble cuisine and the farmers' traditional cuisine. It includes main courses such as \\"pasticcio di maccheroni\\" or the popular cappelletti and lasagne all made with fresh egg pasta. The ancient Ferrara bread, the renaissance ‚Äúciup√®ta\\", is widely available throughout the town, still prepared with the old recipe and protected as a European mark ‚ÄúIGP\\", with its unique and strange shape that recall in the same time the male and the female symbols.

Projects=Long Way Round His best known work is as the cameraman who accompanied Ewan McGregor and Charley Boorman on their Long Way Round motorcycle journey eastward from London to New York in 2004 and Long Way Down from Scotland to South Africa in 2007. Shortly before the 2004 trip von Planta discovered his motorbike licence was invalid for the journey. He subsequently failed his bike test the day before the team was due to leave. He remained in London and retook the test two weeks later, eventually flying out to join up with the team in Prague, the capital of the Czech Republic. Von Planta would often ride far ahead of the other two in order to film them going past, or trail behind getting the shots he wanted. He suffered a couple of bad falls on the journey. At one point in Mongolia his bike took such a battering it had to be sent ahead for repairs and a replacement bike was purchased by McGregor and Boorman. In 2006, he linked up again with Russ Malkin and Charley Boorman as the Director of Photography for Race to Dakar, a documentary chronicling the teams' attempt at the Dakar Rally. In 2007, he reprised his role as cameraman on Long Way Down. He would again suffer an accident on the trip, coming off and damaging the bodywork on his bike after narrowly avoiding Boorman who was rapidly slowing down on a motorway in South Africa. Racing Green Racing Green Endurance (RGE) was a student-led project at Imperial College London to demonstrate the potential of zero emission cars. The team drove 136 day down the Pan-American Highway starting from north Alaska in July 2010 to Argentina in an open-top electric sportscar, which was filmed by von Planta as eight 22 minute episodes for the BBC World News channel.  Other career  After leaving the Swiss Army in 1982, von Planta studied politics at the University of Zurich. He sold his first film in 1985 and has continued to build his portfolio of work since then. He has filmed in locations as diverse as war zones, terrorist training camps and the Pfizer UK marketing conference. He spent a month in prison in Pakistan for crossing the border illegally. He related a brief version of the story on the DVD release of Long Way Round while discussing the inability of the Swiss embassy to help their citizens. In October 2007, he filmed Hull Freedom Trail, a road journey from Hull, England to Freetown, Sierra Leone undertaken by a group of five 4x4 vehicles. The vehicles were to be donated to charity projects working in Freetown to reunite families torn apart by the years of civil war in the country, and attempting to raise awareness of modern slavery/human trafficking issues.

The building stands on the site of the former Calton Jail. Today, the turreted Governor's House is all that remains of the former prison, next to the Old Calton Burial Ground and Political Martyrs' Monument. The large Category A listed Art Deco- influenced building looks out over Waverley Station, the Canongate and Holyrood Park. Construction The Old Calton Jail The building was designed by Thomas S. Tait of Burnet, Tait and Lorne, architects, who won the architectural competition to gain the commission. Construction began in November 1935 and was completed in 1939; the building initially housed the Scottish Office, including the offices of the Secretary of State for Scotland. The heraldic sculpture on the front is by John Marshall. The requirement for the building arose as a result of a post World War I policy of limited transfer of devolved administrative (but not legislative) power to Scotland from London. The building opened to staff on Monday 4 September 1939 (the day after War was declared). An official Royal opening ceremony timed to take place on 12 October 1939 was \\"cancelled due to War\\" (Britain's first air raid of the war took place only four days later over the Forth Bridge). Instead, it was officially opened by King George VI and Queen Elizabeth on 26 February 1940. Architecture Nelson's Monument. Architecturally, the building is monolithic, symmetrical and restrained on the main north facade. To the south, facing the Waverley valley, it is much more irregular and romantic in expression. There are many Art Deco influences. Tait's design incorporates elements of Art Deco and Streamline Moderne and is noted for being a rare example of sensitively designed modern architecture in Edinburgh. The building features a number of sculpted decorations, also in the Art Deco style, which are credited to several sculptors: Sir William Reid Dick designed symbolic figures; heraldic devices are the work of Alexander Carrick and Phyllis Bone; the large bronze doors were designed by Walter Gilbert and executed by H.H. Martyn; and the secondary doors and stairs are by Thomas Hadden. St Andrew's House is designated a Category A listed building by Historic Scotland. Governmental use Main entrance to St. Andrew's House St. Andrew's House was originally designed and built as the official headquarters of the Scottish Office. Following the passing of the Scotland Act 1998, since 1999 St. Andrew's House now accommodates part of the Scottish Government, including the office of the First Minister of Scotland and Deputy First Minister of Scotland along with the Private Offices of all the Cabinet Secretaries and the Directorates dealing with justice and health. The building underwent a major refurbishment in 2001, although the facade is still coated in a sooty residue. It now accommodates 1,400 civil servants and has 6 floors.

Burgh Heath however was recorded, appearing as Burgh, held in 1086 by Hugh of Port of Bishop Odo of Bayeux, his overlord; its assets were 5 exemption units (large estates) for which it was taxed on 2.5. =Early Chapel= There was a chapel in the far-removed hamlet of Kingswood which had existed long before the middle of the 15th century; for when the vicarage of Ewell was endowed in 1458, it is mentioned as of long standing. Mention occurs towards the close of the reign of Edward I of England. A church ruling stipulated that the vicar of Ewell should not be obliged to minister to the hamlet of Kingswood or to celebrate Mass in the chapel there; that when any of the Sacraments of the Church were to be administered to the people of that place, the rectors (Prior and convent of Newark) should provide a priest for the purpose; and in case of the death of any inhabitant of Kingswood and his removal to Ewell for burial, the vicar should meet the body at Provost's Cross, on the south side of Ewell, which had been the custom from ancient time.Winchester Diocese Episcopal Registers kept at Wayneflete, i (2) p52 The subsequent history of this chapel is obscure. Post ReformationKingswood Manor= Nonetheless on the Dissolution of the Monasteries (1536-8) King Henry VIII seized Kingswood Manor that comprised almost all the land of Kingswood, earlier valued at ¬£14 6s. 8d in 1535, annexing it to the honour of Hampton Court (its purview). Queen Elizabeth I bestowed it to the first Lord Howard of Effingham for annual service of of a knight's fee, kept until sold by his grandson who was also Earl of Nottingham. As granted to a cavalier by a loyal brother who served Cromwell, a roundhead, the Manorial roll has no mention of Sir John Heydon holding court at the manor; it passed to a relative of Howard's wife Charles Cockayne, another royalist who on in 1656 conveyed it to Thomas Bludworth. Bludworth of Flanchford, Reigate held it on the Restoration until October 1660, holding court for years until 1698, when his son took over, then sold it in 1703 to Lynch and Brandon as trustees for Thomas Harris, who held a court in 1708. Kingswood Manor then descended to his son Thomas, whose nephew John Hughes in 1791 sold the manor to William Jolliffe, whose son Hylton Jolliffe was owning it in 1804, selling it in about 1830 to Thomas Alcock, from whose executors it was bought by Sir John Hartopp, and from his trustees by H. Cosmo Bonsor. =Other occurrences at this time= In this era today's Brighton Road through Croydon and Redhill, the A23 replaced the Old Brighton road which came up Reigate Hill, passed through Lower Kingswood and by Upper Kingswood and on into Sutton, which is now the A217, preventing development of the area. In 1632 and from 1669‚Äì1812 St Mary the Virgin Church, Ewell maintained separate Kingswood books with all the conformist births, deaths and marriages of Kingswood. Post Industrial Revolution Kingswood was until the early 20th century the administrative unit of Kingswood Liberty see Liberty (division), of , a completely detached part of Ewell parish, bounded on the west and north by Banstead, on the east by Chipstead and Gatton, on the south by Reigate. Based on the 1841 census, Samuel Lewis writes of Kingswood in 1848 there were 848 inhabitants and, in brief, consisted of of which 400 were woodland and the remainder almost wholly arable. Kingswood Warren (house) was built about 1850, see Landmarks. In 1838 an ecclesiastical district was formed from a new church costing over ¬£1100 consecrated 14 January 1836 from Kingswood with a portion of Banstead, and a newer church, St. Andrew's, was built in 1848 by Thomas Alcock. Malden states in 1911 that the old church in 1911 was used as a parish room and the church was still endowed with a glebe of 31 acres. Kingswood Methodist chapel was built by the late H. Fowker however has been converted.The Methodist Church - find a church, the nearest being on the borders of Burgh Heath at Great Tattenhams St Marks Church Kingswood became in 1899 the terminus of a branch of the South Eastern and Chatham Railway, now the Tattenham Corner branch. Writing in 1911, Malden states: the neighbourhood which used to be singularly sequestered and rural is fast becoming residential, especially since the opening of the railway. But the majority of the new houses are in the part of Banstead included in the ecclesiastical parish of Kingswood, not in the old portion of Ewell. Lower Kingswood School was built in 1893 and enlarged in 1903. Tadworth and Kingswood School (in Banstead parish) was built in 1875. Both are County Council Schools. Kingswood is today characterised by housing which is described as arcadian, which implies it is 'spacious and tree- dominated'.Kingswood Warren, now Kingswood Warren Park, an Octagon Development Geography=Elevation, geology and soil The entire ward sits on top of the North Downs and, taken as a whole, slopes gradually from 200m AOD in the south to 170m AOD in Upper Kingswood in the north. Kingswood is rectangular, less than 3 miles from north to south, and is under a mile broad. Upper watercourses cut gentle valleys in this ward including between Lower Kingswood and Upper Kingswood where the land dips from 174m AOD in Lower Kingswood to 144 along Chipstead Lane that divides Lower and Upper Kingswood and is closer to Lower Kingswood - three residential streets around Chipstead Lane form Hogden Bottom, Lower Kingswood including Chipstead Lane itself. This ravine is accompanied by another, along which the Kingswood railway runs towards London, further down this joins the Hogden stream at Chipstead Bottom in a short distance at the east edge of the ward: here the elevation is only 111m AOD. Upper Kingswood is lower than much of Lower Kingswood, however its gradients are less steep than the depths of Hogden Bottom between the two, fractionally closer to the developed southern part of Lower Kingswood and possibly considered part of it therefore. The main street is on average at a modest 166m AOD, with the central, station section at 147-152m AOD. Below to the northeast and northwest are Sutton and Epsom at 30-40m at their centres. The folding landscape around both explains the misnomer among the names. Its geology is that of the North Downs, see Surrey - Geology; as to soil Chipstead, Banstead and Tadworth have the first free draining slightly acid loamy soil that tops the wider downs to Guildford and is found around Dorking.Cranfield University National Soil Resources Institute Localities Manor Lane Lower Kingswood Modernist housing at Burgh Heath - taken at dusk Footpath towards Canons Wood on Burgh Heath Upper Kingswood or Kingswood This area had a population of 2,839 forming 1,055 households at the time of the 2001 Census.

Immediately north of Upper Kingswood on the A217 road, it adjoins Banstead. Nork, Banstead is the neighbourhood directly north. The dual carriageway has meant that today there are two separate areas of housing: a larger part with shops on the main road and surrounding Canons Lane to the east and the other to the west close to the ponds, facing Burgh Heath and to distinguish it from the built up section, known to its residents as The Green. Burgh Heath had a population of 2,099 forming 839 households at the time of the 2001 Census. Burgh Heath has a large supermarket store, a luxury sports car garage and Toyota's UK headquarters are located in the north of the area at Great Burgh. There is a parade of shops along the A217 of small independent retailers and several small restaurants. However, the majority of residents in the area are commuters out of the area. =Open areas of Burgh Heath= The residential area is bordered to the south by the Burgh Heath itself, one of four parts of Banstead Commons, managed by the Banstead Commons Conservators and its byelaws. It is bordered east and north by farmland leading to Banstead Woods, managed by local authority Reigate and Banstead borough council.H.E.

Ernest Newton was its architect, in terms of size, its main range consists of 11 bays plus a 3-bay west service wing, symmetrically laid out with five bays as bay windows. Constructed from purplish red bricks laid in flemish bond with red brick dressings, it spans three storeys including a purpose-built servant area attic and is georgian in character. This enjoys preservation and upkeep today as a private care home with landscaped gardens.Kingswood Court luxury residential and respite care St Andrew's Church Kingswood war memorial The original church of St Andrew was built in 1835, in a \\"Norman\\" style of architecture, accommodating a congregation of 150. It was consecrated in 1836 and became a parish church in 1838. It soon proved too small for the growing population and in 1848 work began on a larger building on another site. The present St. Andrew's Church was built between 1848 and 1852 at the expense of the then owner of Kingswood Warren, Thomas Alcock. St Andrew's is an exact copy of the 14th century church at Shottesbrooke, Berkshire under the supervision of the architect Benjamin Ferrey. In younger years Thomas Alcock had been a frequent house guest of the Vansittart family at Shottesbrooke Park in Berkshire and worshipped at the church there. The old church served as a parish hall until its demolition in the early twentieth century.

It is the first part of the Robot Romance Trilogy of Super Robot series created by Saburo Yatsude and directed by Tadao Nagahama. The robot's name is a portmanteau of \\"combine\\", \\"combat\\", and \\"battle\\", and the V is intended both as an abbreviation for \\"victory\\" and in reference to the five component machines that form the robot, as well as its five pilots. The V is pronounced as the letter V, unlike in the spiritual successor, Voltes V, where it is pronounced \\"five\\". The show follows the adventures and battles of the Battle Team, a group of young pilots, as they battle against the Campbell Empire from outer space. Story Combattler V unleashing one of its weapons, the Choudenji YoYo. Thousands of years ago, the people of the planet Campbell decided to leave their planet and seek out new worlds to inhabit. One group, led by the scientist Oreana, landed on Earth, but was delayed from their mission. In the early 21st century, Oreana's group reawakens and begins their plan to conquer the Earth. The only effective defense against the Campbellians' giant bio-mechanical slave beasts is the super-electromagnetic robot, Combattler V and its pilots. The entire series follows the then- standard monster-of-the-week format, with the first season featuring Garuda sending various mecha to defeat Combattler V. His tactics range from brute force to cunningness and taking hostages. He even duels Hyouma in a sword fight with their feet chained together; though just as Hyouma is about to kill him, he is saved by Oreana. As the series moves on, his trust for Oreana lessens. Garuda eventually discovers that he is in fact a cyborg, and uncovers a robot specifically designed for him. In the final episode of the first season, he defeats Oreana, and duels Combattler V, which eventually leads to his defeat. The second season features Empress Janelor and her generals Dungele and Warchimedes. The way the second season is structured is quite similar to that of the first, but involves more serious plot points such as the taking of hostages and plots to kill the team. Eventually, the entire base of the Campbellian empress is deployed, and only through the help of the airborne Nanbara Connection Base is Combattler V able to destroy it. However, Janelor manages to deploy an \\"Earth Bomb\\" which is supposed to destroy the Earth. Notably, the team is not dispirited, but are quite calm and instead happy for having the chance to fight to protect Earth. Just as it looks as though Earth will be destroyed, the \\"true\\" leader of the Campbellians, Deus, riding in a golden wagon, informs the team of the coup d'etat at Campbell, and stops the bomb seconds before it burrows into the core of the Earth. Characters=Battle Team * / The hot-blooded leader of the team, dressed in red. Hyouma is an avid motorcyclist and speed freak. He pilots the Battle Jet, which forms the head of Combattler V. After Garuda destroys his arms, he gets cybernetic replacements. He is known as \\"Glen Hyoma\\" in the Philippines. * / The second member of the team, dressed in blue. Juzo is a cool, level-headed Olympic-class marksman. He pilots the Battle Crusher, which forms the chest and arms of Combattler V. He is the only member of the team whose birthdate is revealed: April 1, 1958. He is known as \\"Jason Juzo\\" in the Philippines. * / The third member, dressed in brown. Daisaku is a judo master who also enjoys sketching. He pilots the Battle Tank, which forms the torso of Combattler V, and the Battle Tank is also the only Battle Machine that cannot fly under its own power. He is known as \\"Bob Nishikawa\\" in the Philippines. * / The fourth member, and only female member of the team, dressed in pink. Chizuru is also the granddaughter of Doctor Nanbara. She pilots the Battle Marine, which forms the legs of Combattler V. Upon learning that she has valvular heart disease, she tries to hide it until it disables her in the middle of a battle. Afterwards, she undergoes surgery to correct the condition and returns to continue the fight against the Campbellians. Eventually, she falls in love with Hyouma. She is known as \\"Stephanie Nambarra\\" in the Philippines. * / The fifth member, dressed in green. Kosuke is a child genius and inventor. He pilots the Battle Craft, which forms Combattler V's feet. He is known as \\"Kevin Kosuke\\" in the Philippines. * / The founder and director of the Nanbara Connection, the Battle Team's base of operations, and creator of Combattler V. He dies shortly into the series, after naming Professor Yotsuya his successor. * / After the death of Professor Nanbara, Yotsuya takes over the operation of the Nanbara Connection. A drunkard and misanthrope, he nevertheless vows to defend the earth from the alien invaders. * / A red robot that monitors the emotional state of the Battle Team, and authorizes combination by shouting \\"Combine O.K.!\\". * / and The children of Nanbara Connection's cook, who show up after the midpoint of the series. They played the role of comic relief, giving the latter half of the series a much more comedic tone than the serious first half. Along with their pet frog, Keroppe, they sometimes pilot the sidekick machine Kerott into battle. * / The head of the Lawrence Robotics Research Institution in the country of Great Fridden, and the Garganchuwa's developer. He appears in episode 18 but is killed. Campbellians * / Garuda's \\"mother\\", Oreana orders him to attack the earth. The Campbellians' greatest scientist, she built a giant statue to house her mind in before coming to earth in search of a new home for her people. After her dismissal of Garuda and his discovery of the truth behind his existence, she reveals a mechanical body housed within the statue and attempts to attack Combattler using a 'Null Electromagnetic Ray' from her forehead to drain the robot of its power, but she is ultimately destroyed by Garuda. * / The ostensible leader of the Campbellian's attacks on earthling cities, Garuda oversees the deployment of the Slave Monsters (monster of the week). He is able to change his appearance at will from a blue-skinned, blonde-haired human to a humanoid eagle. After numerous failures to destroy Combattler V and the Nanbara Connection, he is stripped of his rank by Oreana. Soon after, he learns the truth of his origin: That he is actually the last in a line of androids created by Oreana to be her perfect son and the leader of the invasion force. Consumed by revenge, he finishes building the incomplete slave beast Big Garuda and uses it to destroy half part of Oreana's head. After Oreana gets killed by Combattler V, he ultimately battles it but gets defeated and died. * / One of Garuda's android assistants. She is secretly in love with Garuda, but he is oblivious to her feelings. In a gambit to save Garuda after he is dismissed, she sacrifices her life piloting the slave beast Demon against Combattler V. * / Another of Garuda's subordinates, he is in charge of training and activating the slave beasts that fight Combattler V. * / Garuda's strategic advisor. After Garuda's dismissal, he is given command of Oreana's forces, only to be killed by Combattler V during the latter's confrontation with Oreana. * / The final enemy of Combattler V and a very powerful sorceress. She can transform from a beautiful woman into a snakelike creature. She has a eyed- magical cane which can impose orders to Warchimedes and Dungele's helmets for their disobedience. In the penultimate episode, she attempts to destroy the Nanbara Connection and Combattler V with a bomb attached to Combattler's foot. Professor Yotsuya discovers the bomb in time to separate the foot from the rest of Combattler and raise the Choudenji Barrier, sacrificing the Connection and saving Combattler. Upon hearing of the revolt on Campbell, she makes a final attack on the forces of the Earth, but is defeated by Combattler. As her final revenge, she attempts to destroy the earth by sending a thermonuclear explosive into the planet's core. As she attempts to escape earth, Warchimedes confronts her and destroys himself to kill her. * / Janera's scientific and strategic advisor, and Dungele's older brother. He coordinates the building and selection of the Magma Beasts that are sent to fight Combattler V. After the death of Dungele, he pilots a Magma Beast into battle, attacking Combattler V and giving Janera the opportunity to destroy the Nanbara Connection. When he is defeated, his brain is transferred into a robot body, which he then self-destructs to kill Janera. His name, pronounced \\"Warukimedesu\\" in Japanese, rather than being partly based on the English word \\"war\\", may be better regarded as a portmanteau formed from \\"waru\\" (meaning \\"evil\\") and \\"Arukimedesu\\" (Archimedes), thus epitomising the classic sci-fi concept of a great but evil scientist. * / Janera's other subordinate, and Warchimedes's younger brother. He pilots the Magma Beasts against Combattler V and the Nanbara Connection. One of his hands is an oversized lobster-like pincer. After numerous defeats at the hands of Combattler V, Janera kills him by detonating a bomb inside his helmet. * / The true leader of the Campbellians. After the coup d'etat which overthrew Janera's supporters on Campbell, he came to Earth to help rebuild the cities damaged by Janera's attacks. MechanicsProduction The series (along with the later two shows) was created by Saburo Yatsude, who would later go on to create Golion (best known to American viewers as the \\"Lion Force\\" half of Voltron). \\"Saburo Yatsude\\" is not a real person, but a pseudonym which refers to the collective staff at Toei (the main office, rather than the animation studio; the series was animated by Sunrise and produced by Toei Company). The series was animated by Sunrise on Toei's behalf. A sizable portion of the staff that worked on the earlier show Yuusha Raideen also worked on Combattler V. However, according to Tadao Nagahama, there were still efforts to sell a continuation to Raideen even when it looked to be clearly ending, ignoring the demands of Combattler's producer, Takashi Iijima. In the end, right at the point where creating the new program would have been at the last second, Nagahama rejected the continuation of Raideen and its staff finally went over to work on Combattler, putting pressure on their schedule.„Ç≥„É≥„Éª„Éê„Éà„É©„ÉºV „Éú„É´„ÉÜ„ÇπV „ÉÄ„Ç§„É¢„Çπ „ÉÄ„É´„Çø„Éã„Ç¢„Çπ Â§ßÂÖ® (Combattler V/Voltes V/Daimos/Daltanious Complete).

Various manga adaptations were released both during its airing and afterwards. Many toys were also produced. The anime itself was brought to the Philippines and dubbed in Tagalog, Cebuano and Hiligaynon. The series saw sequels in both Voltes V and Daimos and is the first show in Nagahama's Robot Romance Trilogy. Combattler V appeared the United States was in the late 1970s as a part of Mattel's Shogun Warriors line of imported Super Robot toys under the name of 'Combattra', and as such was one of the three Super Robots in the Marvel Comics companion series.

Plot summary A competition is held between two brothers on their father's ski slopes; one is a skier, the other a snowboarder. The competition would determine if snowboarders could be allowed to be a part the ski patrol. Into the scene arrives Rudy James, played by Jim VarneyJim Varney who stumbles his way into a job as ski patrol, entertainment host, and jack of all trades. What was cut out of the film was that Rudy James was hired by Mimi, played by Brigitte Nielsen,Brigitte Nielsen to ineptly sabotage the ski hill so that she could win it in a divorce proceeding. The two brothers discover her plot to damage their father's ski hill (played by SCTV's Joe Flaherty) and further hilarity ensues. While nearly uncommon today, there was a time when snowboarding was banned from many worldclass resorts, resulting in the concept of poaching. Writer/producer, Rudy Rupak, who was an avid skier trying to learn how to snowboard, seized upon this interesting concept to mine it for its subversive comedic value. Subsequently though Columbia Pictures removed all references to poaching from the script.  Locations  Snowboard Academy was shot on location in Chantecler Ski Resorts, which is part of the Laurentides in the city of Sainte-Adele, Quebec. Shooting lasted 20 days. Additional stunt footage was shot in Squaw Valley Ski Resort, California. Stunts were shot and coordinated by Michael Roban.https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0730160/?ref_=ttfc_fc_cr76  Other  Rudy Rupak was 25 years old at the time he produced this film, making him Canada's youngest film producer at the time. The project was meant to be both a video game and movie. The film was directed by John Shepphird of Teenage Bonnie and Klepto Clyde fame. Rudy credits Quebec producer Claudio Castravelli and his company, Taurus 7, for rescuing the film on the first day of pre-production when the initial bank rejected Columbia Tri-Star's contract because at that point the company was changing ownership from a US company to becoming a part of Sony. The script, written by Rudy Rupak and James Salisko, was considered too edgy and made reference to things like X games and extreme sports. Columbia Pictures however toned down what would have been a PG-13 movie into a PG one given the pressures of an election year when Bob Dole was bent on chastising Hollywood for its alleged immorality. Scenes like peeing onto skiers from a chair lift, and skating on a blunt (marijuana) shaped board were scrapped. Rupak's efforts to sell a video game based on Snowboarding never materialized. Rudy Rupak went on to produce two other feature films including She's Too Tall and The Final Goal which was directed by Paul Kassar, the director of the Keifer Sutherland \\"24\\".  Financing  Snowboard Academy was a rare Canadian feature film that was profitable even prior to its release. Rudy Rupak, the producer first got the script approved and greenlighted by Columbia TriStar Home Video for a minimum guarantee that covered close to 90% of the shooting budget in exchange for all home video rights worldwide. To cover the large all-star cast Rudy licensed the Canadian rights to Allegro Releasing.https://www.imdb.com/company/co0064379/ The balance of the capital came from both the Canadian Film Tax Credits and the Quebec Tax Credit System called SODEC and this paid for the financing costs and delivered a small profit prior to production. This kind of independent film finance is difficult as \\"the lucrative screenplay development deals of the ‚Äô80s are no longer easy to come by\\".http://filmmakermagazine.com/58169-intelligent-screenplay- development/#.VjQjYvmrSUk While Rudy was able to get funding for other films his experience with another snowboarding themed movie, Boardlordshttp://playbackonline.ca/1996/12/02/18491-19961202/ left him to realize that he had \\"taste but not talent\\" according to Rudy.

The church is built on the site of a hostel for pilgrims to Santiago de Compostela. The present building is the work of the Waghemakere family and Rombout Keldermans, in Brabantine Gothic style. The church contains the grave of Peter Paul Rubens in the eastern chapel. History St. James' Church, interior From 1431 on, even before the church was built, the chapel on this site was a stop on the route to the burial place of Saint James the Great in Santiago de Compostela. In 1476 the chapel became a parish church so plans were made to replace the modest building with a large church. Fifteen years later, in 1491, construction of the late Gothic church started. It was not completed until 1656, when Baroque architecture was in vogue. Fortunately throughout all those years the architects closely followed the original Gothic design, hence the consistent Gothic exterior. The interior, however, is decorated in Baroque style. The plans at the start of the construction, in a time when Antwerp was on its way to becoming one of the most important economic hubs in Europe, were very ambitious. The church was to feature just one tower, but this was to be about tall, well above the of the two planned towers of Antwerp Cathedral. Unfortunately, due to the decline of the city from the mid-16th century on, financial problems eventually caused construction to be halted after the tower had reached just one third of its planned height. Although the original interior was destroyed during the iconoclastic storms of 1566 and 1581, the Baroque 17th-century interior is well preserved thanks to a priest who pledged allegiance to the French revolutionaries, who had just invaded the city. In return, he was rewarded by being permitted to choose one church in Antwerp which would not be plundered, and chose St. James', thus saving the interior. Many of the original stained-glass windows were unfortunately destroyed during World War II. Among the Baroque interior decorations are the carved wooden choir stalls, created between 1658 and 1570, the opulent main altar (1685) and the communion rails of the holy chapel (1695). The central pulpit was created in 1675 by Lodewijk Willemssens.

Located in Cathedral Square, it is sometimes referred to simply as Gibraltar Cathedral, although it should not be confused with the Cathedral of St. Mary the Crowned, which is Gibraltar's Roman Catholic cathedral. The cathedral is particularly notable for its Moorish revival architecture, particularly in its use of horseshoe arches. This is an architectural style inspired by Moorish architecture, appropriate given the period of Moorish control in Gibraltar's history. History=19th century The church was originally built to meet the needs of Anglican worshippers among the civil population of Gibraltar, as the King's Chapel was primarily reserved for military use. John Pitt, Earl of Chatham, who had arrived as Governor of Gibraltar in 1820, persuaded the British Government to sell a derelict building and use the money to build a church on the land. Building work began in 1825 and the church was completed in 1832. The architect is unknown; Colonel Pilkington of the Royal Engineers was in charge of the work. During the building process, the partially completed church had to be used for a short time as an emergency hospital during an epidemic of yellow fever. The church was consecrated in 1838 by Archdeacon Edward Burrow in the presence of the Dowager Queen Adelaide, widow of William IV. It was raised to cathedral status in 1842, with the creation of the Diocese of Gibraltar at the time of enthronement of George Tomlinson as the first Bishop of Gibraltar.History of the Cathedral of the Holy Trinity. 20th century The cathedral suffered no significant damage during the Second World War. After the war had come to an end, Bishop Harold Buxton made an appeal for the purpose of \\"Saying Thank You to Malta and Gibraltar\\", with the intention of raising funds to be spent on improvements for St Paul's Pro-Cathedral, Malta and the cathedral in Gibraltar. In Gibraltar the money raised was used for the construction of new vestries and the creation of a second chapel in the south aisle of the cathedral, to be dedicated to Saint George and in memory of all who lost their lives in the Mediterranean area during the war. A stone from Coventry Cathedral, which was ruined in the Blitz, is let into the wall behind the baptismal font. It is a small stone with a cross. The explosion of the RFA Bedenham on 27 April 1951 caused substantial damage to the cathedral, lifting the roof and smashing the stained glass. The windows in the sides of the building were re-glazed with plain glass, whilst the gathered fragments of coloured glass were used to construct the new stained glass window which remains in the east wall, above the high altar. The cathedral required extensive repair work and was not in use until Christmas of that year.  Clergy  As with most Church of England cathedrals, the priest in charge of the building and its ministry is called the Dean (John Paddock retired in November 2017).Diocese in Europe ‚Äî Prayer Diary (Accessed 7 January 2018) The Canon Theologian and acting Dean is Robin Gill.Cathedral of the Holy Trinity, Gibraltar ‚Äî Clergy (Accessed 7 January 2018) Adrian Mumford is the honorary Lay Canon Precentor.

It is in the Kozhikode district of Kerala in south India and is noted for timber trading. During the late 19th century early 20th centuries, the Chaliyar River was extensively used as a waterway for carrying timber from the forest areas in and around Nilambur to the various mills in Kallai near Kozhikode (Calicut). Rafts made of logs were taken downstream during the monsoon season to Kallai, where these were sawn to size in the timber mills dotting the banks of the river. During this period, Kallai was one of the most important centers in the world for the timber business. The place was noted for woods of superlative strength and durability like teak, rosewood etc. Towards the second half of the 20th century, the activity declined drastically as tree felling was banned or strictly controlled with a view to stop deforestation. Many mills still operate in Kallai, though with far less output. Many have now closed down. Kallayi Road starts from Palayam junction in the very heart of old Kozhikode. The first junction towards the south is Pushpa Junction which connects to Mankavu on the east and Kuttichira Beach on the west. The road continues to the south with landmarks like Paico Bookstall, Marzook College and the Kallayi Library.

Although the popular phrase for the most common of these is a neon lamp, it is more efficient to have the glass tube filled not with pure neon, but with a Penning mixture, which is defined as a mixture of one inert gas with a minute amount of another gas, one that has lower ionization voltage than the main constituent (or constituents).  Explanation  The other gas, called a quench gas, has to have lower ionization potential than the first excited state of the noble gas. The energy of the excited, but neutral, noble gas atoms then can ionize the quench gas particles by energy transfer via collisions; known as the Penning effect. A very common Penning mixture of about 98‚Äì99.5% of neon with 0.5‚Äì2% of argon is used in some neon lamps, especially those rated at 110 volts. The mixture is easier to ionize than either neon or argon alone, and lowers the striking voltage at which the tube becomes conductive and starts producing light. The optimal level of argon is about 0.25%, but some of it gets adsorbed onto the borosilicate glass used for the tubes, so higher concentrations are used to take the losses into account; higher argon content is used in higher-power tubes, as hotter glass adsorbs more argon. The argon changes the color of the \\"neon light\\", making it slightly more yellowish. The gas mixtures used in nixie tubes often also included a small amount of mercury vapor, which glowed blue. A Penning mixture of neon and argon is also used as a starter gas in sodium vapor lamps, where it is responsible for the faint reddish glow before the sodium emission begins. The Penning mixture used in plasma displays is usually helium or neon with small percentage of xenon, at several hundred torr. Penning mixtures with the formulas of argon‚Äìxenon, neon‚Äìargon, argon‚Äìacetylene, and xenon‚ÄìTMA are used as filler gases in gaseous ionization detectors. Other kinds of Penning mixture include helium‚Äìxenon.

It is also known as Brueghel's syndrome and oral facial dystonia. It is actually a combination of two forms of dystonia, blepharospasm and oromandibular dystonia (OMD). When OMD is combined with blepharospasm, it may be referred to as Meige‚Äôs Syndrome named after Henri Meige, the French neurologist who first described the symptoms in detail in 1910. The symptoms usually begin between the ages of 30 and 70 years old and appear to be more common in women than in men (2:1 ratio). The combination of upper and lower dystonia is sometimes called cranial-cervical dystonia. The incidence is about one case in 20,000 people. Presentation The main symptoms involve involuntary blinking and chin thrusting. Some patients may experience excessive tongue protrusion, squinting, light sensitivity, muddled speech, or uncontrollable contraction of the platysma muscle. Some Meige's patients also have \\"laryngeal dystonia\\" (spasms of the larynx). Blepharospasm may lead to embarrassment in social situations, and oromandibular dystonia can affect speech, making it difficult to carry on the simplest conversations. This can cause difficulty in both personal and professional contexts, and in some cases may cause patients to withdraw from social situations. The condition tends to affect women more frequently than men. Symptoms Oromandibular Symptoms *difficulty opening the mouth (trismus) *clenching or grinding of the teeth (bruxism) *spasms of jaw opening *sideways deviation or protrusion of the jaw *lip tightening and pursing *drawing back (retraction) of the corners of the mouth *deviation or protrusion of the tongue. *jaw pain *difficulties eating and drinking *difficulties speaking (dysarthria) Blepharospasm symptoms *the first symptom to appear is an increased rate of blinking *uncontrollable squinting/closing of eyes *light sensitivity (photophobia) *squinting/eyes closing during speech *uncontrollable eyes closing shut (rare instances completely causing blindness) In addition, in some patients, the dystonic spasms may sometimes be provoked by certain activities, such as talking, chewing, or biting. Particular activities or sensory tricks may sometimes temporarily alleviate OMD symptoms, including chewing gum, talking, placing a toothpick in the mouth, lightly touching the lips or chin, or applying pressure beneath the chin. Diagnosis Meige's is commonly misdiagnosed and most doctors will not be familiar with this condition due to its rare incidence. Usually, a neurologist specializing in psychomotor disorders can detect Meige's. There are currently no technological diagnostic tools to detect Meige's, as it cannot be identified using blood chemistry analysis or radiological imaging, such as MRI or CT scans. A patient presenting with signs of OMD alone may be misdiagnosed as suffering from TMJD. Patients with idiopathic Meige's syndrome do not quickly respond to anticholinergic drug treatments, a diagnostic sign that can help differentiate it from acute dystonia, which does respond to anticholinergic drugs. Upper and lower dystonia types The Greek word blepharon means \\"eyelid\\". Spasm means \\"uncontrolled muscle contraction\\". The term blepharospasm ['blef-a-ro-spaz-m] can be applied to any abnormal blinking or eyelid tic or twitch resulting from any cause, ranging from dry eyes to Tourette's syndrome to tardive dyskinesia. The blepharospasm referred to here is officially called benign essential blepharospasm (BEB) to distinguish it from the less serious secondary blinking disorders. \\"Benign\\" indicates the condition is not life-threatening, and \\"essential\\" is a medical term meaning \\"of unknown cause\\". It is both a cranial and a focal dystonia. Cranial refers to the head and focal indicates confinement to one part. The word dystonia describes abnormal involuntary sustained muscle contractions and spasms. Patients with blepharospasm have normal eyes. The visual disturbance is due solely to the forced closure of the eyelids. Oromandibular dystonia (OMD) is a form of focal dystonia that affects varying areas of the head and neck including the lower face, jaw, tongue and larynx. The spasms may cause the mouth to pull open, shut tight, or move repetitively. Speech and swallowing may be distorted. It is often associated with dystonia of the cervical muscles (Spasmodic Torticollis), eyelids (Blepharospasm), or larynx (Spasmodic Dysphonia). In patients with OMD, involuntary contractions may involve the muscles used for chewing (masticatory muscles). These may include the thick muscle in the cheek that closes the jaw (masseter muscle) and the broad muscle that draws back the lower jaw and closes the mouth (temporalis muscle). Some patients may also experience involuntary contractions of the wide muscle at the side of the neck (platysmal muscle). This muscle draws down the corner of the mouth and lower lip or other muscle groups. Treatment In some cases Meige's syndrome can be reversed when it is caused by medication. Botulinum toxin injections can be helpful for the blepharospasm and for masseter spasm.

Post primary access is a major issue in the district with 78% schools being at primary level. Compare this with high schools which constitute only 8% of government schools in the district. This is also reflected in the enrolment figures for 2016‚Äì17 with 6,987 students enrolled in class 1 to 5 and only 170 students enrolled in class 9 and 10. Gender disparity is another issue in the district. Only 26% schools in the district are girls‚Äô schools. Access to education for girls is a major issue in the district and is also reflected in the low literacy rates for females. Moreover, the schools in the district lack basic facilities. According to Alif Ailaan district education rankings 2017, the district is ranked at number 141 out of the 155 districts of Pakistan for primary school infrastructure. At the middle school level, it is ranked at number 126 out of the 155 districts. These rankings take into account the basic facilities available in schools including drinking water, working toilet, availability of electricity, existence of a boundary wall and general building condition. Approximately 4 out of 5 schools do not have electricity in them. 1 out 3 schools lack a toilet and 3 out of 5 do not have a boundary wall. About 1 out of 2 schools do not have clean drinking water.

With regard to transportation-related issues, RPCs are empowered to provide technical assistance to local governments on growth management matters; coordinate land development and transportation policies in a manner that fosters region-wide transportation systems; review local government comprehensive plan amendments, evaluation/appraisal reports, and Developments of Regional Impacts for consistency with state and regional plans; and, review the plans of independent transportation authorities and metropolitan planning organizations to identify inconsistencies between those plans and applicable local government plans. RPCs are a type of Regional planning organization, specific to the state of Florida. RPC Products In addition to various studies of the resources of the region, the principal product of each RPC is the Strategic Regional Policy Plan (SRPP). The SRPP identifies key regional resources and facilities, examines current and forecast conditions and trends (including expected growth patterns), and establishes regional goals and policies that guide a program of actions to address identified problems and needs. An example of strategic subject areas that a SRPP may address includes affordable housing, economic development, emergency preparedness, natural resources and regional transportation. RPCs may also be involved in a variety of other programs other than growth management, such as emergency preparedness programs planning, GIS services, statistical analysis, small business development and public health projects. RPCs Composition Each county in the region shall have a member on the Board of Directors of the RPC in its region and shall have at least one vote. Local governments and the Governor of Florida may appoint either locally elected officials or lay citizens, provided that at least two-thirds of the voting members are locally elected officials. Each RPC's Board may be composed of the following members: *Local elected officials (city and county commissioners). *Officials appointed by the Governor, including an elected school board member to be nominated by the Florida School Board Association. *Ex officio nonvoting members appointed by the Governor. RPC Organization There are 11 RPCs in the State of Florida; one for each comprehensive planning district of the state: *West Florida RPC, Pensacola *Apalachee RPC, Tallahassee *North Central Florida RPC, Gainesville *Northeast Florida Regional Council, Jacksonville *Withlacoochee RPC, Ocala (Written out of existence by 2015 SB 1216; Fl Stat 186.512) *East Central Florida RPC, Orlando *Central Florida RPC, Bartow *Tampa Bay RPC *Southwest Florida RPC, Ft.

HawkeKeating The term was first used to describe an agreement made in November 1988 between Prime Minister Bob Hawke, and his Treasurer Paul Keating, which was effected at Kirribilli House. Hawke agreed that he would resign in favour of Keating at an unspecified time after the 1990 election but before the subsequent election. On Keating's insistence, this undertaking was witnessed by ACTU Secretary Bill Kelty and businessman Sir Peter Abeles; both were mutual friends of Hawke and Keating. After securing a fourth term in March 1990, Hawke reneged on the agreement in January 1991 following a \\"treacherous\\" speech by Keating, called the Placido Domingo speech, delivered to the National Press Club in December 1990 which belittled Hawke's leadership. Keating resigned as Treasurer in June 1991 and challenged Hawke for the Prime Ministership. Although this initial challenge failed, he challenged Hawke a second time in December 1991 and won. HowardCostello Whilst still in opposition, John Howard reached a similar agreement with Peter Costello in December 1994 which was witnessed by the Liberal MP Ian McLachlan. McLachlan reported that Howard agreed, if Alexander Downer resigned and Howard became leader and subsequently Prime Minister after 1996, that he would hand over the leadership to Costello after one and a half terms. Howard reported that the meeting took place but that no exact deal was struck. After Howard became Prime Minister, approaching his 64th birthday and after two and a half terms in 2003, he asserted his intention to stay on as leader. Costello made several public statements that did little to hide his distemper at the decision. After the 2004 election, Costello did not exercise his right to challenge for the leadership. Speculation throughout 2005 saw multiple cabinet ministers begin to be mentioned as possible successors to Howard, including Brendan Nelson, Alexander Downer, Tony Abbott and Malcolm Turnbull; of the four, Downer had already served as Liberal leader and the remaining three would all serve as Liberal leader in the future. Costello fuelled speculation that he would challenge Howard for the leadership in 2006, but Howard ultimately remained Prime Minister and Costello Treasurer up to the 2007 election, where Howard lost his seat of Bennelong and his government was defeated. Costello declined to assume the leadership, even after Howard endorsed him as his successor. Other usage The term has also been applied in various Australian state political environments including with Colin Barnett and Troy Buswell and with Mike Nahan and Liza Harvey in Western Australia; with Peter Beattie and Anna Bligh in Queensland; and in sport.

Originally from Angeln, present-day Schleswig-Holstein, a legendary list of their kings has been preserved in the heroic poems Widsith and Beowulf, and the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle. Legendary kings of the Angles According to Anglo-Saxon legends recounted in Widsith and other sources such as √Üthelweard (Chronicon), their earliest named ancestor was a culture-hero named Sceaf, who was washed ashore as a child in an empty boat, bearing a sheaf of corn. This is said to have occurred on an island named Scani or Scandza (Scania), and according to William of Malmesbury (Gesta regum Anglorum) he was later chosen as King of the Angles, reigning from Schleswig. His descendants became known as Scefings, or more usually Scyldings (after Sceldwea). The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle derives the royal lines of the Heptarchy from a common ancestor, Woden, a euhemerized version of the Germanic deity, and said to be a descendant of the aforementioned Sceaf. The senior line of this genealogy was that of Mercia, descended from the rulers of the Angles. The historical Anglo-Saxon invasion of Britain took place during the 5th to 6th centuries. As historical records only set in the later 7th century, after Christianisation, reliable information on the royal genealogies only extend to what was then in living memory, to the early 7th century. Bede (Historia ecclesiastica gentis Anglorum), writing in the early 8th century, has reliable information on the 7th century, but is silent on the 6th. The genealogies extending into the 6th or even 5th century and thence to Woden are now regarded as fabrications of the later Anglo-Saxon period. The genealogies as presented in the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle incorporate various Germanic heroes of legend, such as Wihtl√¶g, who defeated and killed Amleth, King of the Jutes. Under Wermund the Angles' fortress at Schleswig is said to have been captured by a branch of the Saxons known as the Myrgings, but was retaken by Offa about whom many tales were told (and who is usually referred to as Offa of Angel to distinguish him from his supposed descendant Offa of Mercia). The legends give Offa as bride a daughter of Freawine, governor of Schleswig, and upon becoming king he is said to have secured the Angles' southern border with the Saxons along the River Eider. Like Offa, Freawine is made a descendant of Woden, and father of Wig, whose names were intruded into the pedigree of the kings of Bernicia when it was transferred to that of the kings of Wessex (ancestors of the kings of England). Wihtl√¶g, Wermund and Offa also appear in a long list of legendary Danish kings given by Saxo Grammaticus (Gesta Danorum). All other sources name them as kings of the Angles,Munro Chadwick, H. The Origin of the English Nation (1907) though according to Matthew Paris (Vitae duorum Offarum) Offa and his line personally ruled over the West Angles, implying that other branches of the tribe had their own subordinate rulers (Offa is described in Beowulf as ruling an 'empire'). Whilst Offa's line went on to found the Kingdom of Mercia, these putative cadet lines may eventually have engendered the ruling dynasties of East Anglia, Deira and possibly Bernicia. As for the other Anglo-Saxon kingdoms, the kings of Lindsey appear to have been an offshoot of the Mercian line; those of Wessex claimed descent from the aforementioned Freawine, though their subjects were Saxons; those of Essex and Sussex were Saxon; and those of Kent were Jutish.Ashley, Mike. The Mammoth Book of British Kings and Queens (1999) The genealogy connecting the Icling dynasty of the earliest kings of Mercia with Woden consists of at least five generations in Angeln: #Wihtl√¶g son, grandson or great-grandson of Woden, #Wermund son of Wihtl√¶g, #Offa son of Wermund, #Angeltheow son of Offa, #Eomer son of Angeltheow #Icel son of Eomer, participated in the invasion of Britain. Gesta Danorum Some of these names have parallels in the Gesta Danorum by Saxo Grammaticus. * Wihtl√¶g (as Wiglecus). Wihtl√¶g married Nanna. Deposed Fiallar, King of Scania and defeated and killed Amleth, King of the Jutes. * Wermund (as Wermundus). After a long reign, Wermund suffered an invasion by Eadgils of the Myrgings (fl. c. 370) who slew Freawine (as Frowin), governor of Schleswig. *Offa of Angel (as Uffa). Offa married a daughter of Freawine. Regarded as a simpleton in youth, Offa fought the Saxons at Rendsburg on an island in the River Eider, thereby securing his southern border with them. Eomer Eomer () is the son of Angeltheow in the genealogy of the Anglo- Saxon Chronicle, but in Beowulf he is the son of Offa and grandson of Wermund (v. 1958‚Äì1963): {:...for√æam Offa w√¶s :geofum and gu√∞um gar-cene man, :wide geweor√∞od; wisdome heold :e√∞el sinne, √æonon Eom√¶r woc :h√¶le√∞um to helpe, Heminges m√¶g, :nefa Garmundes, ni√∞a cr√¶ftig.  :...Hence Offa was praised :for his fighting and feeing by far-off men, :the spear-bold warrior; wisely he ruled :over his empire. Eomer woke to him, :help of heroes, Hemming's kinsman, :Grandson of Garmund, grim in war.(Gummere's translation)  } The name of Eomer was used for a character in J. R. R. Tolkien's Lord of the Rings.

Representatives from these different works meet together annually under the umbrella of Fusion International to support and encourage the development of this work. Teams and centres Fusion's services focus on community building, finding a sense of purpose and a Christian values base. Fusion's centres are established in response to research of local needs. In Australia this has led Fusion into outreach and support services such as drop-in centres and youth cafes, lunchtime programs in schools, accommodation and dwelling programs for youth and families, arts and crafts and social activities for isolated women, parenting programs for young single parents, mentoring and other special programs for teenagers who are not fitting into the school system, employment training schemes, outdoor education programs, community festivals designed to build connection in fragmented towns and suburbs, vocational rehabilitation, radio and print media and contributing to social policy development and action. Training programs Fusion Australia Ltd is a Registered Training Organisation, providing nationally accredited training within the Australian Qualifications Framework. Fusion runs a Certificate IV in Youth and Community Work (Christian). Fusion also trains educators to work in both first world and developing countries, developing community development skills to equip communities to be healthier.

Later this story was also used to explain the name Antwerp ('Antwerpen' in Dutch) which, according to the story, is a derivative of 'handwerpen' (meaning hand throwing). Brabo once killed a giant, called Druon Antigoon, who asked money from people who wanted to pass the bridge over the river Scheldt. When they didn't want to or couldn't pay, he cut off their hand and threw it in the river. Because of this, Brabo also removed the hand of the giant, and threw it into the river. This mythical story is still shown by the statue in front of the Antwerp City Hall. Typical local biscuits named 'Antwerpse Handjes', (Antwerp's hands) also refer to this. Only licensed bakers within the city are allowed to produce and sell them. There is also a chocolate version in the same size and shape.

The deformation of a droplet depends on the speed at which it is erupted from the volcano, its surface tension, the viscosity (thickness) of the magma and the resistance it experiences as it travels through the air. Pele's tears are also found entangled within fine strands of volcanic glass known as Pele's hair and it was considered that they formed together under similar conditions. Shimozura (1994) investigated this further and found that the velocity of the erupting lava was the main factor in determining whether Pele's tears or Pele's hair were formed. If the velocity of the erupting magma is high then Pele's hair is formed and if the velocity is low the formation of Pele's tears is favoured. Under the microscope very tiny Pele's tears (less than 1 Œºm) can be found within the cavities of Pele's hair. This would suggest they formed prior to being trapped within the strand and supports a different mechanism for formation. It has been considered that they became trapped during transport in the eruptive plume. Scientific importance Pele's tears Pele's tears are interesting to volcanologists because trapped within the glass droplet are bubbles of gas and particles called vesicles. When these are analysed they can provide a great deal of information about the mechanisms of an eruption. For instance, the shape of a vesicle can provide an indication of the velocity of the eruption. When vesicles form within the lava they are spherical in shape. If the eruption is turbulent the vesicles will deform and become elongated in shape. If the velocity is low they will retain their spherical shape as in the case of Pele's tears. The composition of a magma chamber includes lava, crystals and gases known as volatiles. At high pressures within the magma chamber, gases are dissolved in the melt and are soluble. As the magma rises, the pressure decreases and the gases come out of solution. Some of these gases escape and some become trapped in the melt. When the gases trapped within the vesicles of Pele's tears are analysed they can provide a great deal of information about the chemical composition of the magma chamber. This information can be used to determine the explosive nature of an eruption and help to understand the complex processes occurring within volcanos. This is important in the management of natural hazards.

Career Creaney began his career with Celtic, signing from the boys club and making his competitive debut in the first team on 24 March 1990 in a 0‚Äì0 draw away at Dunfermline. He played in a further five games for Celtic that season, and scored his first goal in a 1‚Äì1 draw against Dundee on 21 March 1990. Creaney featured regularly for Celtic the following season, scoring in a win against Dundee United in the league cup semi-final, then netting twice in a 3‚Äì2 win over St Mirren, scoring the winning goal in the last minute. In November 1990, Creaney played in the 1990 Scottish League Cup Final against Rangers, but Celtic lost 2‚Äì1 after extra time. In March 1991, he opened the scoring for Celtic in a 2‚Äì0 win over Rangers in a Scottish Cup tie at Parkhead. The match however is best remembered for the four red cards shown; three Rangers and one Celtic player all being sent off in a torrid second half. Creaney went on to make a total of 37 appearances for Celtic in all competitions that season, scoring 10 goals. He played 113 times for the club, scoring 36 goals. It was during this time that he was capped for Scotland under-21, for whom he reached the 1992 European under-21 Championship semi-finals. At club level, he never fully established himself as a first choice striker with veterans such as Frank McAvennie and Charlie Nicholas still featuring prominently in the first team. Creaney's sole honour during his time in Glasgow was as a runner-up in the 1990‚Äì91 Scottish League Cup. Creaney was transferred to Portsmouth in January 1994, going on to score 30 goals in just over 60 matches and earning a ¬£1.5m-valued move to Manchester City eighteen months later, with City paying ¬£500,000 and ¬£1million-rated Paul Walsh moving to Fratton Park in exchange. The move gave Creaney an opportunity to play Premier League football (which Portsmouth had failed to come anywhere near in spite of Creaney's fine form in Division One) where, despite scoring on his debut, he failed to prosper, scoring only four goals in his 21 City appearances. Later in the season he faced competition for the role as Uwe Rosler's strike partner from new arrival Nigel Clough, who was similarly disappointing. He was loaned out to Oldham, Ipswich, Burnley and Chesterfield whilst at Maine Road before being released in 1999. He had brief spells at St Mirren, Notts County, Finnish side TPV, Raith Rovers and Clydebank before retiring in December 2000. After retiring from playing football, Creaney became a qualified accountant. In January 2010 Creaney returned to football when he was named as assistant to manager Danny Drew at Bellshill Athletic. On 12 October 2010, Creaney become manager at Bellshill Athletic after Danny Drew resigned. He was appointed head of youth development at Dundee in October 2014, but left by this position by mutual consent in November 2015. He is married to Scottish Film Director Wilma Smith.

Head of a noncyclostome braconid. Morphology The morphological variation among braconids is notable. They are often black-brown (sometimes with reddish markings), though some species exhibit striking coloration and patterns, being parts of M√ºllerian mimicry complexes. They have one or no recurrent veins, unlike other members of the other family in Ichneumonoidea (Ichneumonidae), which usually have two. Wing venation patterns are also divergent to apparent randomness. The antennae have 16 segments or more; the hind trochanters have two segments. Females often have long ovipositors, an organ that largely varies interspecifically. This variation is closely related to the host species upon which the wasp deposits its egg. Species that parasitize microlepidopterans, for instance, have longer ovipositors, presumably to reach the caterpillar through layers of plant tissue. Some wasps also have long ovipositors to bypass caterpillar defense mechanisms such as spines or hairs, or to reach deeply-burrowed Coleoptera larvae in tree trunks.http://scholarcommons.scu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1018&context;=bio Parasitoidy Cotesia ruficrus illustrated by Des Helmore The larvae of most braconids are internal or external primary parasitoids of other insects, especially the larval stages of Coleoptera, Diptera, and Lepidoptera, but also some hemimetabolous insects such as aphids, Heteroptera, or Embiidina. Most species kill their hosts, though some cause the hosts to become sterile and less active. Parasitoidy on adult insects (particularly on Hemiptera and Coleoptera) also occurs. Members of two subfamilies, the Mesostoinae and Doryctinae are known to form galls on plants. Braconids are often used as biological pest control agents, especially against aphids. Examples of hosts Thousands of species of insects are used as hosts by braconid wasps. A few notable examples are detailed here. Some species of braconids are parasitoids of the Asian corn borer (a lepidopteran moth known for being a pest of maize in East Asia), the African sugarcane borer (a moth commonly found in sub-Saharan AfricaHastings, H.** Conling, D.E., Graham, D.Y.* & (1988-03-01). \\"Notes on the natural host surveys and laboratory rearing of Goniozus natalensis Gordh (Hymenoptera: Bethylidae), a parasitoid of Eldana saccharina Walker (Lepidoptera: Pyralidae) larvae from Cyperus papyrus L. in Southern Africa\\"(PDF). Journal of the Entomological Society of Southern Africa. 51 (1). ISSN 0013-8789.), the butterfly Danaus chrysippus in Ghana, and the american serpentine leafminer and tomato hornworm in North America. Braconids often will prey on fruit fly larvae like A. suspensa as well.  Polydnaviruses  Endoparasitoid species often display elaborate physiological adaptations to enhance larval survival within the host, such as the co-option of endosymbiotic viruses for compromising host immune defenses. These bracoviruses are often used by the wasps instead of, or in addition to, a venom cocktail. The DNA of the wasp actually contains portions that are the templates for the components of the viral particles and they are assembled in an organ in the female's abdomen known as the calyx.Piper, R. (2007), Extraordinary Animals: An Encyclopedia of Curious and Unusual Animals, Greenwood Press. A 2009 study has traced the origins of these templates to a 100-million-year-old viral infection whose alterations to its host DNA provided the necessary basis for these virus-like \\"templates\\".B√©zier, A., et al. Polydnaviruses of braconid wasps derive from an ancestral nudivirus. Science Magazine 323(5916), 926-30. February 13, 2009. These viruses suppress the immune system and allow the parasitoid to grow inside the host undetected. The exact function and evolutionary history of these viruses are unknown. Sequences of polydnavirus genes show the possibility that venom-like proteins are expressed inside the host caterpillar. Through the evolutionary history of being used by the wasps, these viruses apparently have become so modified, they appear unlike any other known viruses today. Because of this highly modified system of host immunosuppression, a high level of parasitoid-host specificity is not surprising. Evolutionary history The family seems to date from early Cretaceous (provided that Eobracon is properly assigned to this family). It underwent extensive diversification from mid or late Cretaceous to early Cenozoic, correlating with the radiation of flowering plants and associated insect herbivores, the main hosts of braconids. Differentiation from Ichneumonidae Ichneumonidae wing morphology Braconidae wing morphology Braconids are distinguished from their sister group Ichneumonidae by these character combinations. In Braconidae, vein 2m-cu of the forewing is absent except in the Chilean species Apozyx penyai - this vein is present in 95% of Ichneumonidae. Vein 1/Rs+M of the forewing is 85% present in Braconidae, but absent in all Ichneumonidae. Vein 1r-m of the hind wing is in 95% of Braconidae basal to the separation of R1 and Rs (it is opposite or apical in Ichneumonidae). In Braconidae, metasomal tergum 2 is fused with tergum 3, (secondarily flexible in Aphidiinae) - 90% of Ichneumonidae have a flexible suture.Sharkey, M. J.

The youth wing of PCC was the Collectives of Young Communists ‚Äì Communist Youth (Col¬∑lectius de Joves Comunistes - Joventut Comunista). PCC was formed in April 1982 by the pro- Soviet faction of the Unified Socialist Party of Catalonia (PSUC). The formation of PCC was the peak of a long and intense struggle within PSUC between the pro-Soviet and Eurocommunist sections of the party. The pro-Soviet section were often nicknamed 'Afghans' due to their support of the Soviet line of the war in Afghanistan. In December 1981 Pere Ardiaca, chairman of PSUC and leader of the pro-Soviet section, had been expelled from PSUC, accused of fractional activities. When PCC was constituted Ardiaca was elected chairman of the new party. In 1984 PCC merged into the Communist Party (later renamed the Communist Party of the Peoples of Spain, PCPE), and it became its regional wing in Catalonia. However, the party soon broke the bonds to PCPE and reconstructed itself as an independent party. Instead PCPE formed a new Catalan branch, the Communist Party of the Catalan People (Partit Comunista del Poble Catal√†). In 1987 PCC took part in the formation of Initiative for Catalonia (IC), a broad coalition of leftwing parties led by PSUC. In 1989 it left IC. In the 1993 elections it contested on IC lists as part of the electoral coalition of IC-Greens. In 1998 PCC and PSUC viu formed the United and Alternative Left (EUiA), which became the new Catalan referent of the Spanish United Left (IU) following the break between IU and IC.

Overview The town is located in southern Balochistan province in Pakistan. It is situated on the left bank of the Kech River () which is a tributary to the Dasht River (). The Makran Range () to the north and east descends to the coastal plains in the south. The town is a marketplace for dates grown in the surrounding region and has a date- processing factory. Jowar (sorghum), barley, wheat, and rice are also grown, and livestock are raised. Koh-e-Murad () is a shrine located in Turbat. This is a sacred place for Zikris. They believe that Mahdi the 12th imam had travelled to this place, and offered prayers for a long time. The followers of Zikri sect gather here annually on the night of 27th Ramadan for a ritual visit (, ) to this shrine. And Turbat also has multilingual singers. The town has a special place in Baloch folklore and literatures as it is the home of Punnu, hero of the romance of Sassi Punnun. The remains of Punnu's fort can still be seen at Turbat.District Profile: Southern Balochistan ÔøΩ Kech - Dawn Atta Shad, who is considered as one of the greatest poets of Balochi literature was also born in Singanisar, a town in Turbat city. He was not only versatile in Balochi poetry, but he was also greatly appreciated for his contribution in Urdu poetry. He was unique in his diction and style. He is credited to have written four books that include two Balochi books, Rochgir and Shap sahar indem, and two Urdu books, Singaab and Barfag. He died on 13 February 1998 in Quetta, the capital of Balochistan province.Article by Ilyas Shad in 2013 Turbat is the birthplace of Qadir Bukhsh Rind Baloch alias Kadu Makrani was a 19th-century archetypal figure who was born and brought up in Makran, Balochistan. He rose as an insurgent in Kathiawar, Gujarat, martyred and buried in Karachi, Sindh in 1887. His final resting place in Mewa Shah Graveyard (Lyari) which has become the center of inspiration today. He is also remembered as the eastern Robin Hood. Koh-e-Imam lake is a Holy Place, its mountainous range stretches more than 15‚Äì25 km from main Kech (Turbat) City. Where you find many picnic points as there are many natural water reservoirs, during rainy seasons. In koh-e-imam there are also centuries old tombs we call them DAMD in Balochi Language. They are mysterious in a sense that people still don't find facts about the tombs aside of the river which is almost more than 100 km. Besides, Turbat is considered to be one of the main hubs of separatist insurgent groups active against Pakistani armed forces and the development projects running under the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor. The city has also witnessed violence against non-local men who have either come for business or serving government officials from other parts of Pakistan mostly from the Punjab province. The city has come under discussion on media because of the attacks on non-local men or labourers of companies working on development projects. The city holds many military check points at the surroundings because of the security situation affected by the separatist insurgency. The security situation is now much improved. The city is one of the most significant cities of Balochistan as the important Gwadar port is 180 km away from the town. Gwadaris linked by the highway recently developed and improved under CPEC project. Turbat has an international airport that has many flights to the Gulf states of Oman, the UAE and Qatar. Although the city is not coastal but still has a newly built Pakistan Navy base camp which is being expanded to become a major air base in the future supporting Karachi. Turbat on its extreme South links with another coastal city of Pasni that comes administratively under district Gwadar. In the Northwest it shares a border with Iran 120 km away. The town members have a visa-free entry to Iran as many members have relatives at the Iranian side of the border. Diesel smuggling from the Iranian border remains one of the major source of income in the town that is smuggled to Karachi. The power line that feeds Turbat comes from Iran and the market is heavily filled by Iranian products. History In 12th century Turbat and its surrounding areas were ruled by Prince Punnu and his father Jam Asli or Jam Aari. Later, Turbat was ruled by the Gichki Tribes of Makran and as well ruled by the Buledi Tribe about 400 years ago. It was then the headquarters of the Makran State and the Nawab of Makran resided in Shahi Tump near Turbat. When Makran State was dissolved, Turbat city remained the Division Headquarters.

Gagliano and his brother-in- law Nunzio Pomilla were partners in lathing and hoisting companies in the Bronx. He served as underboss to Gaetano \\"Tom\\" Reina until he became the boss of the family in 1930. The Reina family controlled a monopoly on ice distribution in the Bronx. Gagliano along with Gaetano \\"Tommy\\" Lucchese and Stefano \\"Steve\\" Rondelli were viewed as the most powerful members of the Reina family. Frank Gagliano was a distant relative of Tommy Gagliano and the son of a deported mobster. He was also the cousin of mob boss Thomas Eboli's chauffeur and bodyguard, future Genovese crime family underboss Dominick Alongi who would later achieve notoriety when they were among the many mobsters arrested fleeing the famous 1957 Apalachin Meeting. He was a blood relative of mobster Joseph (Pip the Blind) Gagliano, who became a childhood friend and early accomplice of future government witness Joseph Valachi. The two performed many burglaries and armed robberies together. Castellammarese War During the late 1920s, a bitter gang rivalry arose in New York between Joseph \\"the Boss\\" Masseria, the most powerful mobster in New York, and Salvatore Maranzano, head of the Castellammarese Sicilian clan. Masseria had demanded more money from Reina, prompting Reina to consider switching allegiance to Maranzano. When Masseria heard about Reina's plans, Masseria murdered him in February 1930. To head Reina's gang, Masseria appointed one of his loyalists, Joseph Pinzolo. Both Gagliano and Lucchese hated Pinzolo and resented Masseria appointing an outsider as gang leader. In September 1930, Pinzolo was shot and killed by unknown assailants. To replace Pinzolo, Masseria appointed Gagliano as head of the Reina gang. It is speculated that Gagliano and Lucchese formed a secret alliance with Maranzano at this time while still professing loyalty to Masseria. As the war continued, Masseria began suffering more defeats and key defections. On April 15, 1931, Masseria was assassinated at Brooklyn restaurant by several of his men. These defectors, guided by Charles \\"Lucky\\" Luciano, had made a deal with Maranzano guaranteeing their power if they switched sides. However, after Masseria's death, Maranzano started promoting himself as the \\"Boss of All Bosses\\" for all the Italian-American criminal gangs in the country. Feeling betrayed and threatened, Luciano arranged Maranzano's assassination a few months later in September 1931. During this period of instability, Gagliano remained in control of the Reina gang. Cosa Nostra families After Maranzano's death, Luciano restructured all the Italian-American criminal gangs into several crime families regulated by a commission of family bosses. The aim of this restructuring was to settle disputes without bloody gang wars. The New York City gangs were divided into five crime families. Gagliano took over the old Reina family, with Lucchese as his underboss. As a boss, Gagliano became a member of the commission. Gagliano steered the family through a period of high tension between the Five Families. In 1936, Luciano was sent to prison and then, in 1946, deported to Italy. With Luciano's absence, power on the commission was held by an alliance of bosses Vincent Mangano, Joe Bonanno, Stefano Magaddino and Joe Profaci. Gagliano had to be very careful in the face of this alliance, and was keen to keep a low profile while furthering the business interests of his section of Cosa Nostra, in industries such as gasoline rationing, meat and black market sugar. He usually issued his orders through his close allies, particularly Lucchese, who served as the family's public face and de facto street boss. As a result, very little is known about Gagliano between 1932 and his death from natural causes in the 1950s. In 1932, Gagliano was convicted of tax evasion and sentenced to 15 months in the Atlanta Penitentiary. Date of death Woodlawn Cemetery The actual date of Gagliano's death is still uncertain. In 1951, Lucchese stated during the Senate hearings on organized crime that Gagliano died on February 16, 1951. However, some historians believe Gagliano died in 1953. It has been speculated that Gagliano retired in 1951 and turned leadership over to Lucchese, but kept this information secret to prevent law enforcement or media scrutiny; however, there is no concrete evidence to support this theory. According to Joseph Valachi, Gagliano died of natural causes in 1953. Tommy Gagliano is interred in a private mausoleum at Woodlawn Cemetery, Bronx, New York. In popular culture *Gagliano is mentioned in The Valachi Papers (1972), starring Charles Bronson, when Salvatore Maranzano (Joseph Wiseman) announces the Bosses of the Five Families. *In 2014, Eldorado the last episode of the final season of Boardwalk Empire, Gagliano is played by Salvatore Inzerillo. He has a small speaking role and is seen sitting at the table as Lucky Luciano gathers the country's most powerful crime bosses and forms The Commission.

Persiani was born in Recanati. He wrote his first opera - one of 11 - in 1826 but, after his marriage to the soprano Fanny Tacchinardi Persiani, who was to become a significant singer in her time, he devoted much of his efforts to supporting her career. He worked in a variety of opera genres including opera buffa and wrote an oratorio named Abigaille and featuring the same character as in the popular Verdi opera, Nabucco. He was noted for his ability to effectively combine music and drama Giorgio Migliavacca, \\"Revival of Persiani's Ines de Castro - Magnificent but Forgotten Opera of the Donizetti-Bellini Era - Gives Glimpses of Verdi's Dawning\\", Opera-L Listserv posting as well as florid decoration. His best-known opera, In√™s de Castro, from a libretto by Salvadore Cammarano (who also wrote the libretto for Donizetti's Lucia di Lammermoor the same year), was created in 1835 for the celebrated mezzo-soprano Maria Malibran, who sang the role of the 14th-century Portuguese queen of the same name. The opera was first presented at La Scala in January 1837 but by that time, Malibran had died. After some revisions to tailor the role for his wife, the opera was presented in Paris in 1839. While it was given about 60 productions over a period of 16 years, after 1851 it was rarely, if ever, presented but was revived in the 20th Century in the Italian town of Jesi to celebrate the 200th anniversary of Persiani's birth. Persiani died in Paris, aged 69. His birthplace, the town of Recanati, has named an opera house after the composer, the Teatro Persiani.

In 2007, Kerimov established the Suleyman Kerimov Foundation as a vehicle to focus his philanthropic efforts. Since 2008, Kerimov has represented the Republic of Dagestan in the Federation Council of Russia. In April 2018, he was placed under sanctions by the United States Department of Treasury. As of July 26, 2020, American business magazine, Forbes reported that Suleyman has an estimated net worth of USD $21.3 billion ranking him the 56th richest person in the world. https://www.forbes.com/profile/suleiman-kerimov- family/?list=rtb#6de13416174f July 26, 2020 Sunday Education Kerimov graduated from high school in 1983, and following this enrolled in the Civil Engineering Department at Dagestan Polytechnic Institute in 1984, though his obligatory military service for the Soviet Army brought his studies to a halt just one year later. After completing his service in 1986, Kerimov continued his studies at Dagestan State University, where he graduated with a degree in financial accounting and economics in 1989. During his studies he was Deputy Chairman of DSU's Trade Union Committee. It was also at university that Kerimov met his wife, Firuza, the daughter of a former Trade Union leader. Kerimov has stated to have dreamed of making money from an early age, an ambition that prompted him to later move from his native Dagestan in the early 1990s. Career=Early career Soon after his university graduation in 1989, Kerimov took a job as an economist at the Eltav electrical plant in Makhachkala, the capital of Dagestan. The state-controlled plant supplied transistors and semi-conductors to television-makers, while also producing diodes, microchips and halogen lamps. Kerimov was paid 150 roubles (approximately $250 dollars) a month and he and his wife lived in a worker's hostel attached to the plant, where they shared one room of a two-room flat. Eventually, Kerimov rose to the rank of Deputy Director General at Eltav and began to dabble in investing alongside during the fall of the Soviet Union. Fedprombank In 1993, Kerimov was put in charge of handling relations between Eltav and Fedprombank, a Moscow bank established by the electrical company. Fedprombank financed lagging industries and Kerimov and his associates soon became creditors to large utility companies, allowing them to continue to provide key services. Once the Russian economy stabilized, the debts were repaid with hefty returns for Fedprombank and, consequently, Kerimov. In 1995, Kerimov was appointed to head the banking and trading company Soyuz-Finans, and by 1997, Kerimov had built a 50% stake in Vnukovo Airlines and used his leverage to take over Fedprombank, buying out his partners‚Äô shares. Nafta Moskva In late 1999, Kerimov bought a 55% stake in the oil trading company Nafta Moskva, the successor to the Soviet monopoly firm Soyuznefteexport, for $50 million. By 2000, he had increased his stake of Nafta Moskva to 100%. Kerimov undertook a mass restructuring of the company, selling off all of the oil-related aspects and creating an investment and holding company. Nafta's investments in the mid-2000s included purchase of the business center Smolensky Passazh and AvtoBank. Gazprom and Sberbank investments In 2003, Kerimov managed to secure a $43 million loan from the state-owned Vnesheconombank, which he invested in the oil and gas company Gazprom. Within the next year, share prices for the Russian gas company doubled and Kerimov was able to pay off the entirety of the loan within four months. In 2004 Sberbank, now the largest bank in Russia and Eastern Europe, provided Kerimov with a loan of $3.2 billion., which was later repaid, and these funds were also invested in equities. By 2008, Kerimov had amassed a 5% stake in Gazprom, a 6% stake in Sberbank, along with an estimated fortune of $17.5 billion, making him the 36th richest man in the world. However, in mid-2008, Kerimov sold all his Gazprom and Sberbank shares. Polymetal In November 2005, Kerimov's Nafta Moskva acquired JSC Polymetal, one of Russia‚Äôs largest gold and silver mining companies. In 2007, he took the company public on the London Stock Exchange, then sold 70% of his shares in 2008 before gold would go on to climb to an all-time high in 2011. In 2008, Kerimov sold control over Polymetal. Role in the 2008 crisis As markets around the world began to tighten in 2007, Kerimov and his associates expected that Russia would suffer more than the West from the impending economic crisis. A concerted effort was thus made to build closer ties with Western banks. Kerimov decreased his stakes in Gazprom and other Russian blue chips and approached Wall Street, proposing to invest the vast majority of his fortune to defend the institutions from short-sellers. In return, it was expected that Kerimov would receive favorable lending terms for future loans. In 2007, Kerimov invested billions in Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs, Deutsche Bank, Credit Suisse and other financial institutions. Though neither Kerimov nor the Western banks have disclosed the exact size of his investment, it was sizeable enough for Kerimov to receive a call from the United States Treasury during the darkest days of the economic crisis imploring the Russian oligarch not to sell his stakes. Polyus Gold Following his losses during the economic crisis, Kerimov shifted his investment strategy to buying stakes large enough to influence the strategies of the companies he invests in. In 2009, Nafta Moskva bought a $1.3 billion stake (37% stake) in OAO Polyus Gold, Russia‚Äôs largest gold producer, from Vladimir Potanin. Later the stake was increased up to 40.2%. In 2012 the company held an IPO on the London Stock Exchange. In 2015 Kerimov's share in Polyus Gold was transferred to his son, Said. Property developer PIK Group In the spring of 2009, shareholders of Russia's construction giant PIK Group sold 25% of their company's shares to Kerimov. PIK required extra funding after their debt level reached $1.98 billion, and the value of their capital fell by more than 40 times to $279.9 million. Nafta Moskva later increased its stake in PIK Group to 38.3%. In December 2013 Kerimov sold his shares to property investor Sergei Gordeev and businessman Alexander Mamut, who owns a stake in precious metals miner Polymetal. Uralkali In June 2010, Kerimov and his partners Alexander Nesis and Filaret Galchev together paid Dmitry Rybolovlev an estimated $5.3 billion for a 53% stake in Russian potash giant Uralkali,which, together with Belaruskali, at the time made up the duopoly that controlled 70% of the global potash market: the Belarusian Potash Company (BPC). Kerimov secured substantial loans from Russia's VTB bank for the Uralkali takeover. In July 2013, Uralkali announced it was pulling out of the BPC cartel, dropping prices and increasing production to maximum capacity in a grab for market share. The immediate consequences on the global economy were a 25% drop in potash prices to around $340 a tonne, harming the prospects of both Canadian producers and the Belarusian economy. Belarusian authorities estimate they may lose up to $1 billion a year. Two weeks after Uralkali's July announcement, Belarusian prime minister Mikhail Myasnikovich responded by inviting Kerimov and the Uralkali managers to Minsk to discuss the current situation. Uralkali's then-CEO Vladislav Baumgertner attended in Kerimov's place and was arrested by state security forces and charged with \\"abuse of power\\". In the meantime, Belarus also opened a criminal investigation into other Uralkali employees and its main shareholder Suleyman Kerimov. Baumgertner was held in a Belarusian KGB jail until a plan to change ownership of Uralkali was announced, and Belarus then extradited Baumgertner to Russia. Belarus put Kerimov on the national wanted list, and also requested Interpol to publish a Red Notice for him. Interpol clarified later that no Red Notice had been issued and that the request was political in nature. The Belarusian authorities later withdrew the case against Kerimov and closed the criminal investigation. By December 2013, Kerimov sold 21.75% of Uralkali shares to Mikhail Prokhorov for US$3.7 billion and 19,99 % (for approximately US$2.9 billion) to Uralchem. Media portrayal of business style Forbes magazine describes Kerimov as one of the most private Russian billionaires, who has not given a single interview over 20 years in business. Moscow Times quoted a former deputy editor of Forbes Magazine Russia Kirill Vishnepolsky as describing Kerimov as a \\"Russian Warren Buffet\\" for a similarly astute investment style. A senior Moscow banker is reported to have said of Kerimov: \\"Sometimes it is difficult to talk to him. He is always a few steps ahead of you. For foreigners, it is next to impossible, even those used to a Russian environment. He is very quick and creative, in a sense that ideas come to him that don‚Äôt come to other people\\". Kerimov reportedly made extensive use of leverage for his investments, according to financiers and bankers active in Russia. His financial success is based on investments that have significant growth potential with a strategy focused on locking in asset capital gain through resale. Wealth In 2006 Kerimov was listed among the world's 100 richest people and as Russia's eighth richest man ranked by Forbes. He had a net worth of $6.9 billion as of 2014, with the previous years' net worth estimated at $7.1 billion (2013) and $6.5 billion (2012). In 2015 Kerimov was listed as the 18th wealthiest person in Russia. Other investments=FC Anzhi Makhachkala In 2011, Kerimov purchased FC Anzhi Makhachkala, his hometown football club which competes in the Russian Premier League. FC acquired number of famous players, the most striking were international stars Roberto Carlos and Samuel Eto'o from Inter Milan, Yuri Zhirkov from FC Chelsea. In March 2012, it was reported that Kerimov had given the club a summer transfer budget of over ‚Ç¨230 million, in an attempt to qualify for the UEFA Champions League within the next three seasons. Apart from FC Anzhi, Kerimov financed the construction of a modern football stadium Anzhi Arena for 30,000 spectators and teams from Anzhi's Youth Football Academy. In August 2013, as a part of new long-term strategy for the club, it was decided to scale back the club's annual budget by $50‚Äì70 million, down from their previous outlay of $180 million a season. The club sold some international players and recruited Russian young players instead. Kerimov sold the club to Osman Kadiyev on 28 December 2016. Business controversies and investigations=Business controversy over Nafta Moskva Shortly after Kerimov bought into Nafta Moskva, the company found itself in a conflict with businessman Andrei Andreev. Andreev's assets were transferred to Nafta Moskva, Millhouse Capital and Basic Element. Further dispute brought the parties to the court. In July 2004 Andreev and Nafta Moskva reached an amicable settlement and the dispute was resolved. Moskva Hotel ownership and associated issues Nafta Moskva, controlled by Kerimov, acquired a 25% stake in the Hotel Moskva project, a multibillion-dollar project to construct a replica of the enormous Stalin-era luxury hotel demolished in 2004. in February 2009, closing the deal by January 2010. In September 2010, Member of Russian Parliament Ashot Egiazaryan accused Kerimov of conspiring with the city government of Moscow to forcibly acquire his 25% stake in the project. After claiming he received death threats, Egiazaryan fled to the United States to seek asylum and filed lawsuits in a civil court in Cyprus, the London Court of International Arbitration and on Capitol Hill claiming that a campaign of threats of criminal prosecution and armed police raids forced him to give up his shares. According to Kerimov's lawyer Mr Egiazaryan transferred his interest in the Moskva Hotel as part of a legitimate business deal but was overextended and was deep in debt. Mr Egiazaryan was facing financial ruin. Pending deliberation by the courts, Kerimov's assets were frozen, upsetting Uralkali‚Äôs $39 billion joint bid with Chinese company Sinochem for the Canadian Potash Corp. The Nicosia district court in Cyprus lifted Kerimov‚Äôs billion dollar asset freeze in February 2011, arguing that the plaintiffs \\"failed to prove the urgency of their petition.\\" According to Egiazaryan's lawyer, Andreas Haviaras, the Cyprus ruling was based on \\"technicalities\\" and did not prejudge the merits of the case. The hotel reopened in 2014 under the Four Seasons brand. In October 2015, Suleiman Kerimov sold his interest in the property to businessmen Yury and Alexey Khotin for an undisclosed amount. French tax evasion case In November 2017, Kerimov was arrested by French police at Nice airport in connection with a tax evasion case concerning his alleged purchase of several luxury residences on the French Riviera via shell companies. The charges were dismissed the following June. In March 2019, French prosecutors placed Kerimov under formal investigation \\"on suspicion of complicity in tax fraud\\". He was released on bail of ‚Ç¨20 million and his lawyer plans to appeal the accusation of fraud. U.S. sanctions In April 2018, the United States imposed sanctions on Kerimov and 23 other Russian nationals. Kerimov is one of many Russian \\"oligarchs\\" named in the Countering America's Adversaries Through Sanctions Act, CAATSA, signed into law by President Donald Trump in 2017. Political life=Member of the State Duma From 1999-2003, Kerimov was a member of the State Duma of the 3rd Convocation, the lower house of the Federal Assembly of Russia, as well as a member of the State Duma Committee for Security. From 2003-2007, while continuing his role on the Committee for Security, he was also a member of the 4th Convocation and Deputy Chairman of the State Duma Committee for Physical Education, Sports and Youth. He first gained a seat in parliament with the Liberal Democratic Party, led by Vladimir Zhirinovsky. Member of the Federation Council Since 2008, Kerimov has served as a member of the Federation Council of the Federation Assembly of the Russian Federation ‚Äî the upper house of the Federation Assembly‚Äî and represents the Republic of Dagestan. In response to the Russian parliament‚Äôs passage of a bill prohibiting government officials from holding foreign-issued securities and bank accounts abroad, Kerimov transferred his assets to the Suleyman Kerimov Foundation, a charity registered in Switzerland, in May 2013. This way, he retained both his position in the Federation Council and beneficiary rights to his business assets. Suleiman Kerimov was re-elected to the Federation Council in September 2016. Endorsement of Moscow In October 2011, Kerimov used his connections to fly Western financial figures such as Jamie Dimon of JPMorgan, Richard Parsons of Citigroup and Stephen Schwarzman of Blackstone to Moscow in support of Medvedev‚Äôs initiative to turn Moscow into an \\"international financial centre\\". In 2007 Kerimov became involved in the reconstruction of the Moscow Cathedral Mosque, which opened in September 2015 and is the largest in Europe. Kerimov donated $100 million to the project. Personal life Kerimov's father was a lawyer at a criminal investigation institution, while his mother was an accountant for the Savings Bank of Russia. He is married and has three children. Ice. On 26 November 2006, in Nice, France, Kerimov was seriously injured after losing control of his Ferrari Enzo on the Promenade des Anglais. He suffered severe burns as a result of the accident. Known for spending much of his fortune on parties, the Russian billionaire has paid for celebrities such as Christina Aguilera, Shakira, Amy Winehouse and Jessie J perform at his events. From 2005-2015, Kerimov owned one of the world's largest private yachts, which is known as Ice. Previously known as Air, she was built by German company L√ºrssen in 2005. Ice measures 295 feet (90 metres) in length, and can reach a speed of 18.6 knots (33 km/h; 21 mph). She has won the Superyacht of the Year award at the World Superyacht Awards in 2006, and is currently the 54th largest yacht in the world. He sold Ice to Teodoro Nguema Obiang Mangue's Equatorial Guinea interests in 2015. Philanthropy Kerimov established the Suleyman Kerimov Foundation in 2007, with a vision to enhance the lives of young people in Russia and throughout the world, by investing in initiatives that strengthen communities and help those in need. Unlike most charities in Russia, the foundation work closely with the government, meaning their projects have much better long-term prospects. Kerimov, Mahmoud Abbas, Vladimir Putin and Recep Tayyip Erdoƒüan opened Moscow's Cathedral Mosque, 23 September 2015. Suleyman Kerimov Foundation collaborates with the Russian Wrestling Federation ,as well as other sports programs, on supporting gym construction and equipment provision, for several hundred Russian athletes and coaches across the country. Since the inception of the Suleyman Kerimov Foundation in 2007 close to 300 grants totaling over 300 million CHF have been awarded. Funding has been given in accordance with the Foundation's identified ten core funding areas, with special emphasis in the areas of education, religion, social aspects, medicine and sport. The Suleyman Kerimov Foundation partners closely with the Russian charity Podari Zhizn. In 2007 Kerimov became a sponsor of the Kennedy Kennedy Center Honors in Washington: annual awards for a lifetime achievement in the arts. Suleyman Kerimov is head of the supervisory board of the Russian Wrestling Federation, and is a member of the Gorchakov Foundation's supervisory board. On 17 December 2010, the press reported that Kerimov will spend $100 million on the reconstruction of the Zarechenskaya secondary school, an advanced comprehensive school west of Moscow \\"for educating children from different social groups.\\" The school will include a modern sports complex with a swimming pool, a skating-rink, a giant dance floor, as well as a residential area for gifted children from the provinces. Reconstruction was completed in 2015. The Kerimov Foundation also donated to mosque and church constructions and sent thousands of pilgrims to Mecca on Hajj annually. Kerimov spent $100 million on the construction of the Moscow Cathedral Mosque.\\"Putin praises anti-extremism efforts as Moscow mosque reopens\\". BBC News. 23 September 2015. Suleyman Kerimov became a sponsor of the Sirius educational centre for gifted children, located in Sochi and Dagestan. Recognitions and honours The International Federation of Associated Wrestling Styles (FILA) honored Kerimov the \\"Gold Medal\\" in 2013. On 10 March 2016, Kerimov was recognised with an award for outstanding social contribution to the Republic of Dagestan, by the Head of the Republic, Ramazan Abdulatipov. On 8 February 2017 Kerimov and his wife received an award from Andrei Vorobyov, Governor of Moscow Oblast, recognizing their contribution to the reconstruction of the Zarechenskaya secondary school, and their service to the Moscow region. On 20 March 2017 Suleyman Kerimov was awarded the Order for Merit to the Fatherland of II degree by President Vladimir Putin for his outstanding contribution to the development of parliamentarianism and legislation.

Although shot single-camera like most Canadian comedies, this series was shot on videotape and contains a laugh track rather than making use of the usual live audience because most scenes take place outdoors. The show is set in 18th-century Canada back \\"in days when beaver fur was good as gold\\" and features a twisted \\"Blackadder meets F Troop\\"-style Canadian history in which Benny \\"Blackfly\\" Broughton (Ron James), a Maritimes- born undersized but ambitious general jack-of-all-trades at the isolated Fort Simpson-Eaton on the colonial Canadian frontier, is joined by the prissy by- the-book upper class British officer Corporal Entwhistle (Colin Mochrie) whom he is usually able to talk into his latest doomed-to-failure get-rich-quick scheme. Other characters include Blackfly's boss at the Hudson's Bay Company- style trading post, the rowdy, penny-pinching Scottish storekeeper MacTavish (James Kee), Misty Moon (Cheri Maracle), a wryly wise native barkeep who loves watching the white man blow his money on whisky at her Leg Hold Trap Bar between visits by her boisterous if distinctly anglophobic French Canadian voyageur lover Ti Jean (Marcel Jeannin), tough but good-natured local tribal leader Chief Smack-Your-Face-In (Lorne Cardinal), masochistic and desperate- to-be-martyred Jesuit priest Brother Jacques (Stephen Coats), the deranged and drunken fort commander Colonel Boyle (Richard Donat), and his buxom blond daughter Lady Hammond (Shauna Black), the hot-blooded young princess of privilege who had no idea what she was getting into when she decided to join her father in Canada after becoming a widow. Changes to the show during the second season included the arrival of Misty's nasty little witch of a mother Mugwump Moon (Madeleine Bergeron) and the departure of Entwhistle who had inherited his twin brother's title and estate in England, although with his usual luck he found himself stuck back at the fort by the end of the series. The laugh track was removed as James was displeased with the use of it in the first season. The show was produced by Salter Street Films, and reruns began showing during the fall of 2009 on APTN. The opening and closing theme was done by Blain Morris. According to Ron James, the show was cancelled because the two seasons suffered low ratings.

Description Life restoration Adult Prenocephale probably weighed around and measured around long. Unlike the flattened wedge-shaped skull of Homalocephale (a possible juvenile trait also potentially seen in early growth stages of Pachycephalosaurus), the head of Prenocephale was rounded and sloping. The dome had a row of small bony spikes and bumps. It lived in what is now the Nemegt Formation, in high upland forests, not the dry deserts of Mongolia today. Like some other pachycephalosaurs, Prenocephale is known only from skulls and a few other small bones. For this reason, reconstructions usually depict Prenocephale as sharing the basic body plan common to all of the other Pachycephalosauria: a stout body with a short, thick neck, short forelimbs and tall hind legs. The head of Prenocephale was comparable to that of Stegoceras, albeit with closed supratemporal fenestrae. Also, the paired grooves above the supraorbitals/prefrontals (along with a posterior parietal that restricts the frontal dome) are absent in Prenocephale. This differentiates the species from Stegoceras, as such features are common in the latter. The North American Sphaerotholus was considered a synonym of Prenocephale by Sullivan (2003), but Longrich et al. (2010) and Schott and Evans (2016) kept it as a distinct genus based on cladistic analysis. Homalocephale has been viewed as a possible juvenile of Prenocephale due to the lack of a dome and its discovery in the same location and chronological interval, but new specimens of Prenocephale, including a juvenile specimen, suggest that Homalocephale, even if its holotype is a juvenile, is distinct.Longrich, N.R., Sankey, J. and Tanke, D., 2010.

Classification Front view of skull Prenocephale is a member of the Pachycephalosauria, a large clade of herbivorous/omnivorous dinosaurs from the Late Cretaceous. Robert Sullivan considered Foraminacephale, \\"Prenocephale\\" edmontonensis, and Sphaerotholus goodwini to form a clade with the Asian taxon P. prenes. He considered Tylocephale the sister taxon to the Prenocephale clade, while sinking Sphaerotholus buchholtzae as a subjective junior synonym of \\"P.\\" edmontonensis. They all possess a distinct row of nodes on the squamosal and parietal areas of the skull roof. Below is a cladogram modified from Evans et al., 2013. Paleobiology Restoration of flank-butting behavior As with most of its relatives, scientists do not yet know what these dinosaurs ate. However the premaxillary teeth and muzzle are not as wideset as in its relative Stegoceras, indicating different feeding preferences, possibly that Prenocephale was a more selective forager. Some scientists suggest that it may have been an omnivore, eating both plants and insects. However, most experts agree that Prenocephale (and the other pachycephalosaurs) browsed on leaves and fruit.

They are completely fossorial (i.e., burrowing) animals, with habits and appearance similar to earthworms, for which they are often mistaken, although close examination reveals tiny scales rather than the annular segments characteristic of true earthworms. The specific name is a Latinized form of the word Brahmin. No subspecies are currently recognized. Description I. braminus in Hua Hin, Thailand (top) and East Timor (bottom) Adults measure long, uncommonly to , making it the smallest known snake species. The head and tail are superficially similar as the head and neck are indistinct. Unlike other snakes, the head scales resemble the body scales. The eyes are barely discernible as small dots under the head scales. The tip of the tail has a small, pointed spur. Along the body are fourteen rows of dorsal scales. Coloration ranges from charcoal gray, silver-gray, light yellow-beige, purplish, or infrequently albino, the ventral surface more pale. Coloration of the juvenile form is similar to that of the adult. Behavior ranges from lethargic to energetic, quickly seeking the cover of soil or leaf litter to avoid lightBrahminy Blind Snake at the Florida State Museum of Natural History. Accessed 30 August 2007.Brahminy Blind Snake One of the Worlds Smallest SnakeThe one of the smallest snake in the world The tiny eyes are covered with translucent scales, rendering these snakes almost entirely blind. The eyes cannot form images, but are still capable of registering light intensity. Common names I. braminus is variously known as brahminy blind snake (or brahminy blindsnake), flowerpot snake, common blind snake, island blind snake,teliya snake, and Hawaiian blind snake. The moniker \\"flowerpot snake\\" derives from the snake's incidental introduction to various parts of the world through the plant trade. Geographic range Probably originally native to Africa and Asia, it is an introduced species in many parts of the world, including Australia, the Americas, and Oceania. It is common as an introduced species throughout most of Florida now.U.Florida.edu‚ÄîHerpetology: Ramphotyphlops braminus The vertical distribution is from sea level to 1,200 m in Sri Lanka and up to 1,500 m in Guatemala. The type locality given is \\"Vishakhapatam\\" [India]. This is also the only snake reported from the Lakshadweep Islands.Whitaker R. 1978. Common Indian Snakes: A Field Guide. Chennai: Macmillan India Limited. 154 pp. . Indigenous range In Africa, it has been reported in Egypt, Kenya, Senegal, Benin, Togo, Ivory Coast, Cameroon, Zimbabwe, Somalia, Zanzibar, Tanzania, Mozambique, South Africa (an isolated colony in Cape Town, also about eight have been found in Lephalale, Limpopo Province at the Medupi Power Station during construction), Madagascar, the Comoro Islands, Mauritius, the Mascarene Islands and the Seychelles. In Asia, it occurs on Arabian Peninsula, Iran, Pakistan, Nepal, mainland India, the Maldives, the Lakshadweep Islands, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, the Andaman Islands, the Nicobar Islands, Myanmar, Singapore, the Malay Peninsula, Thailand, Cambodia, Vietnam, Laos, Hainan, southern China, Hong Kong, Taiwan, and the Ryukyu Islands of Okinawashima and Miyakoshima. In Maritime Southeast Asia, it occurs on Sumatra and nearby islands (the Riao Archipelago, Bangka, Billiton and Nias), Borneo, Sulawesi, the Philippines, Butung, Salajar, Ternate, Halmahera, Buru, Ceram, Ambon, Saparua, Java, Bali, Lombok, Sumbawa, Madura, Flores, Lomblen, Sumba, Timor, East Timor, Kai Island, the Aru Islands,Aru Islands: requires confirmation according to McDowell, 1974:25 New Guinea (Western Papua and Papua New Guinea), New Britain, and Bougainville Island. It occurs in the Cocos (Keeling) Islands, and on Christmas Island. Introduced range They have been introduced mainly to control the spreading of termites in the following countries. In Australia, it occurs in the Northern Territory near Darwin, and at the northern tip of Queensland and other parts of queensland like sunshine coast. In Oceania, it occurs on Palau, Guam, Fiji, Saipan, Hawaiian Islands and Tahiti in French Polynesia. In the Americas, it occurs in the United States (California, Connecticut, Florida, Louisiana, Massachusetts, Arizona, Hawaii and Texas), western and southern Mexico, Guatemala, Colombia, Barbados and on the Cayman Islands, Turks and Caicos Islands. It has been found in the Canary Islands of Tenerife and Gran Canaria, probably being introduced in soil imported with potted plants. Habitat Usually, they occur in urban and agricultural areas. These snakes live underground in ant and termite nests. They are also found under logs, moist leaves, stones and humus in wet forest, dry jungle, abandoned buildings and even city gardens. The distribution and survival of this group of blind snakes directly reflect soil humidity and temperature. Feeding Their diet consists of the larvae, eggs, and pupae of ants and termites. Reproduction This species is parthenogenetic and all specimens collected so far have been female. They lay eggs or may bear live young. Up to eight offspring are produced - all female and all genetically identical. It has been proposed that the species be transferred to a new genus as Virgotyphlops braminus because of its obligate parthenogenetic nature. ReferencesFurther reading * Annandale N. 1906.

It lived in what is now Africa, specifically Malawi, during the Aptian age of the Early Cretaceous Period. It is one of the few titanosaurs for which skull material has been found. Discovery Size comparison It was named by Louis L. Jacobs and colleagues, Maeve Mercredi Fourie and was originally described in 1928 by Sidney H. Haughton as a species of Gigantosaurus (an invalid name for the diplodocid currently known as Tornieria). Haughton considered it closely related to the species G. robustus (later the type species of Janenschia). Description A reconstruction of the head Relatively small by sauropod standards, Malawisaurus reached lengths of about , and weighed about . In 2020 it was given a smaller estimation of 11 meters (36 ft) and 2.8 tonnes (3.1 short tons). Like some other titanosaurs, ossicles have been found which are believed to represent dermal scutes that covered the skin. The vertebrae from the middle part of its tail had elongated centra. Malawisaurus had vertebral lateral fossae that resembled shallow depressions. Fossae that similarly resemble shallow depressions are known from Saltasaurus, Alamosaurus, Aeolosaurus, and Gondwanatitan. Classification The cladogram below follows Franca et al.

Franck Muller is a Swiss luxury watch manufacturer named after its founder. The company's estimated total sales (in 2010/2011) were ‚Ç¨290 million in watches with an average unit price of ‚Ç¨38,000. Franck Muller's watches are worn by various celebrities, among them Arnold Schwarzenegger, Elton John, Cristiano Ronaldo, Kim Kardashian, Kanye West, David Beckham, Conor McGregor, Floyd Mayweather, Paris Hilton, Eva Longoria, Chris Brown and Jos√© Mourinho. Biography The founder and former CEO of the brand, Franck Muller, was born in 1958. He spent his childhood in La Chaux-de-Fonds with his Italian mother and Swiss-born father. When 15, he enrolled in a watchmaking school. In the early 1980s, he graduated from the Watchmaking School of Geneva (). Afterwards, he began repairing top-quality pocket watches. Close to an independent watchmaker by the name of Svend Andersen, Franck Muller became responsible for handling watches from the collection of Patek Philippe. Most of the clientele were private individuals and museums. While he was working with complicated timepieces, he became passionate about their mechanisms and began to think of building his own workshop. Soon after, in 1984, Franck Muller designed his own tourbillon wristwatch. In the 1980s, few watchmakers were capable of creating such complicated timepieces, among them Patek Philippe and Vacheron Constantin. The private clients of Franck Muller continued to come for new timepieces, and thus his business started growing. The House of Franck Muller opened in 1991,FRANCK MULLER and his ultra complicated timepieces instantly became famous in Europe and the United States. Today, his factory, which is also the headquarters of Franck Muller, produces a limited number of watches for private clientele. Franck Muller's collections include a variety of designs and price ranges. Now the company has five sites (Genthod, Lajoux, Les Bois, Plan-les-Ouates, Meyrin) and 570 official retailers. World premieres Franck Muller is also known for its \\"World Premiers\\". Each year, the manufacturer launches at least one new line of timepieces, featuring something special and exclusive, that has never been seen before in the watchmaking industry. The first such world premiere was launched in 1993. The watches had a split seconds chronograph, a minute repeater, and a perpetual calendar. In addition, the watches included an indicator showing the internal temperature. Notable products The brand of watches carries the slogan \\"Master of Complications\\". Franck Muller timepieces are famous for their fusion of \\"modern\\" style, mostly inspired by American watches from the thirties, like \\"Elgin tonneau\\", and traditional Swiss watch manufacturing. Notable timepieces include Revolution2, Revolution3, Crazy Hours, and Colour Dreams. Further examples of Franck Muller's watches include the Endurance, which is a simple chronograph, the Master Banker, which is a tonneau-shaped watch capable of multiple time zone indication, and the Curvex Minute Repeater Tourbillon, whose production is limited to 25 pieces. * Aeternitas * Casablanca * Color Dreams * Conquistador * Crazy Hours * Curvex * Long Island * Master Banker * Revolution2 * Revolution3 * Vanguard ReferencesExternal links * Interview with Franck Muller * Category:1958 births Category:Living people Category:20th-century Swiss businesspeople Category:Swiss watch brands Category:Swiss watchmakers (people) Category:Luxury brands Category:Watch manufacturing companies of Switzerland Category:People from La Chaux-de-Fonds Category:21st-century Swiss businesspeople Category:Swiss company founders ","title":"Franck Muller"},{"id":"3548544","text":"Senator Jenkins may refer to: *Andrew Jenkins (politician) (born 1941), New York State Senate *Bruce Sterling Jenkins (born 1927), Utah State Senate *Clark Jenkins (born 1948), North Carolina State Senate *Evan Jenkins (politician) (born 1960), West Virginia State Senate *John Jenkins (American politician) (born 1952), Maine State Senate *Lynn Jenkins (born 1963), Kansas State Senate *Perry W.

It is one of the smallest-known adult sauropods, measuring only six meters in length. The type and only certain species is Magyarosaurus dacus. It has been found to be a close relative of Rapetosaurus in the family Saltasauridae in the sauropod clade Titanosauria in a 2005 study. Description Size compared with a human Magyarosaurus was estimated to be in weight. It carried strange dermal armour. The estimated length of Magyarosaurus is , according to Curry Rogers et al.. In 2010 Gregory S. Paul gave lower estimations of one tonne with the same length.Paul, G.S. (2010) The Princeton Field Guide to Dinosaurs, Princeton University Press p. 213 Stein et al. (2010) found that none of Magyarosaurus' close relatives had a reduced size. That means, for its clade, its small size therefore is a distinguishing autapomorphy. A distal caudal vertebrae was referred to the genus by Codrea et al. (2008). It was probably from near the middle of the tail as it has transitional features. Before it was definitively buried, the neural arch was broken off, probably by repositioning of the vertebrae from its original position. Its centrum is elongated, and measures long. Both sides that would have articulated with vertebrae were severely damaged. It is assigned to Magyarosaurus on the basis that no other sauropods are known from the region it was found in, and the fact that it is located between the two vertebrae compared with it because of its intermediate morphology. Discovery Magyarosaurus sp. scapula Remains belonging to at least ten individuals have been recovered from the Hunedoara region (S√¢npetru Formation) in the area which was during their discovery Hungary, but is now western Romania. Initially they were named Titanosaurus dacus, the specific name referring to the Dacians (who had lived in that place about 2000 years ago), by Baron Nopcsa in 1915. Nopcsa had collected fossils in the area since 1895. The species was later renamed Magyarosaurus dacus by Friedrich von Huene in 1932. von Huene in 1932 also named two other species: M. hungaricus and M. transsylvanicus. Larger, rarer M. hungaricus may represent a distinct taxon. The holotype, BMNH R.3861a, consists of a set of vertebrae. Numerous other bones have been found, mainly caudal vertebrae but also dorsals and elements of the appendicular skeleton. No remains of skulls are known. There has been a discovery of 14 fossil eggs which have been attributed to Magyarosaurus. Coracoid Paleontology investigations have been carried out at R√¢pa Ro»ôie near Sebe≈ü, on the southwestern side of the Transylvanian Basin. The investigations were started in 1969. Dinosaur bones were reported in earlier investigations. Based on the investigations carried out by Codrea and Dica in 2005, they have assigned the age of these formations to the Maastrichtian-Miocene age (also conjectured as of Eggenburgian-Ottnangian age). Some of the rare fossils found here are also vertebrates and one of these is of sauropod caudal vertebra. Paleontologists involved with the studies at R√¢pa Ro»ôie have also opined that this is the only sauropod genus reported at any time in the latest Cretaceous Maastrichtian formations in Romania, which could be stated as Magyarosaurus. Paleobiology=Dwarfism The islands it inhabited led to Magyarosaurus becoming a product of insular dwarfism as a result of selective pressures presented by limited food supplies and a lack of predators, all favoring a smaller body size. This is seen in many other dinosaurs existing at the time, including the ornithopod Rhabdodon and the nodosaur Struthiosaurus. Nopcsa was the first to suggest island dwarfism as an explanation for the small size of Magyarosaurus compared to other sauropods. Later researchers doubted his conclusions, suggesting instead that the known Magyarosaurus fossil represented juveniles. However, a detailed study of bone growth patterns published in 2010 supported Nopcsa's original hypothesis, showing that the small Magyarosaurus individuals were adults. Island dwarfism has been suggested to have led to isolated genera retaining more primitive characteristics. Histology Limb bone In 2010, Koen Stein et al. studied the histology of Magyarosaurus. They found that even the smallest individuals appeared to be adults. They also retained \\"M.\\" hungaricus to represent the larger specimens that were too big to be variations of the smaller specimens. The histology of Magyarosaurus showed that it had a very reduced growth rate, but even so, had a high metabolic rate. Armour An osteoderm discovered in the \\"La C√£rare\\" locality. The locality is near S√Ænpetru village, in the Ha»õeg Basin of Romania. The osteoderm was assigned to Magyarosaurus dacus. This shows that dermal armour had a wide distribution in these Late Cretaceous sauropods. The osteoderms was peculiar in shape and size, and led to eggs being assigned to its family, Nemegtosauridae, and possibly to Magyarosaurus. Possible eggs Fossils from the Late Cretaceous of Romania, including Magyarosaurus (E‚ÄìF) Lithostrotian eggs have been assigned to Nemegtosauridae. The eggs possibly belong to either Magyarosaurus dacus or Paludititan, the former being more likely. The Ha»õeg Basin was a large nesting place in the late Cretaceous, and is served as that for hadrosaurids, and titanosaurs. 11 eggs have been assigned to Nemegtosauridae, all from the S√¢npetru Formation. Embryos were preserved inside the eggs, and one egg shows proof of dermal armouring. The eggs were uncovered in 2001, during a field expedition by a Belgo-Romanian team. They were originally identified as in nests, but now it has been shown that no nesting structures has been preserved. Paleoecology During the early Maastrichtian, the Ha»õeg Basin was subhumid, and had seasonal precipitation. However, during the later age of the formation, a large-scale paleoenvironmental change occurred, the region transformed into an extensive wetland. Magyarosaurus dacus is known from the early Maastrichtian of the S√¢npetru Formation, part of the Ha»õeg Basin in Romania. Also known from the Ha»õeg Basin are the small, basal hadrosaurid Telmatosaurus; the small nodosaurid Struthiosaurus; the maniraptorans Balaur, Bradycneme, and Elopteryx; the pterosaur Hatzegopteryx; and the two species of the euornithopod Zalmoxes. M. sp. is known from a vertebra. The vertebra was found in the latest Cretaceous of the Sebe≈ü Formation, although it was probably eroded from the ≈ûard Formation and placed there. Alongside Magyarosaurus existed Kallokibotion, an ancient turtle; Balaur, a two-clawed avialan; and Eurazhdarcho, an azhdarchid. Alongside Magyarosaurus, Telmatosaurus and Zalmoxes also are dwarfed genera, as proven by their histology. References Curry Rogers, K.

The field has experienced several hype cycles, followed by disappointment and criticism, followed by funding cuts, followed by renewed interest years or decades later. The term first appeared in 1984 as the topic of a public debate at the annual meeting of AAAI (then called the \\"American Association of Artificial Intelligence\\"). It is a chain reaction that begins with pessimism in the AI community, followed by pessimism in the press, followed by a severe cutback in funding, followed by the end of serious research. At the meeting, Roger Schank and Marvin Minsky‚Äîtwo leading AI researchers who had survived the \\"winter\\" of the 1970s‚Äîwarned the business community that enthusiasm for AI had spiraled out of control in the 1980s and that disappointment would certainly follow. Three years later, the billion- dollar AI industry began to collapse. Hype is common in many emerging technologies, such as the railway mania or the dot-com bubble. The AI winter was a result of such hype, due to over-inflated promises by developers, unnaturally high expectations from end-users, and extensive promotion in the media. Despite the rise and fall of AI's reputation, it has continued to develop new and successful technologies. AI researcher Rodney Brooks would complain in 2002 that \\"there's this stupid myth out there that AI has failed, but AI is around you every second of the day.\\" In 2005, Ray Kurzweil agreed: \\"Many observers still think that the AI winter was the end of the story and that nothing since has come of the AI field. Yet today many thousands of AI applications are deeply embedded in the infrastructure of every industry.\\" Enthusiasm and optimism about AI has generally increased since its low point in the early 1990s. Beginning about 2012, interest in artificial intelligence (and especially the sub-field of machine learning) from the research and corporate communities led to a dramatic increase in funding and investment.  Overview  There were two major winters in 1974‚Äì1980 and 1987‚Äì1993Different sources use different dates for the AI winter. Consider: (1) : \\"Lighthill's [1973] report provoked a massive loss of confidence in AI by the academic establishment in the UK (and to a lesser extent in the US). It persisted for a decade ‚Äï the so-called '\\"AI Winter'\\", (2) : \\"Overall, the AI industry boomed from a few million dollars in 1980 to billions of dollars in 1988. Soon after that came a period called the 'AI Winter'\\". and several smaller episodes, including the following: * 1966: failure of machine translation * 1970: abandonment of connectionism * Period of overlapping trends: ** 1971‚Äì75: DARPA's frustration with the Speech Understanding Research program at Carnegie Mellon University ** 1973: large decrease in AI research in the United Kingdom in response to the Lighthill report ** 1973‚Äì74: DARPA's cutbacks to academic AI research in general * 1987: collapse of the LISP machine market * 1988: cancellation of new spending on AI by the Strategic Computing Initiative * 1993: resistance to new expert systems deployment and maintenance * 1990s: end of the Fifth Generation computer project's original goals  Early episodes = Machine translation and the ALPAC report of 1966  During the Cold War, the US government was particularly interested in the automatic, instant translation of Russian documents and scientific reports. The government aggressively supported efforts at machine translation starting in 1954. At the outset, the researchers were optimistic. Noam Chomsky's new work in grammar was streamlining the translation process and there were \\"many predictions of imminent 'breakthroughs'\\".John Hutchins 2005 The history of machine translation in a nutshell.Briefing for US Vice President Gerald Ford in 1973 on the junction-grammar-based computer translation model However, researchers had underestimated the profound difficulty of word-sense disambiguation. In order to translate a sentence, a machine needed to have some idea what the sentence was about, otherwise it made mistakes.

Later researchers would call this the commonsense knowledge problem. By 1964, the National Research Council had become concerned about the lack of progress and formed the Automatic Language Processing Advisory Committee (ALPAC) to look into the problem. They concluded, in a famous 1966 report, that machine translation was more expensive, less accurate and slower than human translation. After spending some 20 million dollars, the NRC ended all support. Careers were destroyed and research ended. Machine translation is still an open research problem in the 21st century, which has been met with some success (Google Translate, Yahoo Babel Fish).  The abandonment of connectionism in 1969  :See also: Perceptrons and Frank Rosenblatt Some of the earliest work in AI used networks or circuits of connected units to simulate intelligent behavior. Examples of this kind of work, called \\"connectionism\\", include Walter Pitts and Warren McCullough's first description of a neural network for logic and Marvin Minsky's work on the SNARC system. In the late 1950s, most of these approaches were abandoned when researchers began to explore symbolic reasoning as the essence of intelligence, following the success of programs like the Logic Theorist and the General Problem Solver. However, one type of connectionist work continued: the study of perceptrons, invented by Frank Rosenblatt, who kept the field alive with his salesmanship and the sheer force of his personality. Pamela McCorduck quotes one colleague as saying, \\"He was a press agent's dream, a real medicine man.\\" He optimistically predicted that the perceptron \\"may eventually be able to learn, make decisions, and translate languages\\". Mainstream research into perceptrons came to an abrupt end in 1969, when Marvin Minsky and Seymour Papert published the book Perceptrons, which was perceived as outlining the limits of what perceptrons could do. Connectionist approaches were abandoned for the next decade or so. While important work, such as Paul Werbos' discovery of backpropagation, continued in a limited way, major funding for connectionist projects was difficult to find in the 1970s and early 1980s. , , The \\"winter\\" of connectionist research came to an end in the middle 1980s, when the work of John Hopfield, David Rumelhart and others revived large scale interest in neural networks. and Rosenblatt did not live to see this, however, as he died in a boating accident shortly after Perceptrons was published.  The setbacks of 1974 = The Lighthill report  In 1973, professor Sir James Lighthill was asked by the UK Parliament to evaluate the state of AI research in the United Kingdom. His report, now called the Lighthill report, criticized the utter failure of AI to achieve its \\"grandiose objectives.\\" He concluded that nothing being done in AI couldn't be done in other sciences. He specifically mentioned the problem of \\"combinatorial explosion\\" or \\"intractability\\", which implied that many of AI's most successful algorithms would grind to a halt on real world problems and were only suitable for solving \\"toy\\" versions. , , and see also The report was contested in a debate broadcast in the BBC \\"Controversy\\" series in 1973. The debate \\"The general purpose robot is a mirage\\" from the Royal Institution was Lighthill versus the team of Donald Michie, John McCarthy and Richard Gregory. McCarthy later wrote that \\"the combinatorial explosion problem has been recognized in AI from the beginning\\". The report led to the complete dismantling of AI research in England. AI research continued in only a few universities (Edinburgh, Essex and Sussex). Research would not revive on a large scale until 1983, when Alvey (a research project of the British Government) began to fund AI again from a war chest of ¬£350 million in response to the Japanese Fifth Generation Project (see below). Alvey had a number of UK-only requirements which did not sit well internationally, especially with US partners, and lost Phase 2 funding.  DARPA's early 1970s funding cuts  During the 1960s, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (then known as \\"ARPA\\", now known as \\"DARPA\\") provided millions of dollars for AI research with almost no strings attached. DARPA's director in those years, J. C. R. Licklider believed in \\"funding people, not projects\\" and allowed AI's leaders (such as Marvin Minsky, John McCarthy, Herbert A. Simon or Allen Newell) to spend it almost any way they liked. This attitude changed after the passage of Mansfield Amendment in 1969, which required DARPA to fund \\"mission-oriented direct research, rather than basic undirected research\\". (only the sections before 1980 apply to the current discussion). Pure undirected research of the kind that had gone on in the 1960s would no longer be funded by DARPA. Researchers now had to show that their work would soon produce some useful military technology. AI research proposals were held to a very high standard. The situation was not helped when the Lighthill report and DARPA's own study (the American Study Group) suggested that most AI research was unlikely to produce anything truly useful in the foreseeable future. DARPA's money was directed at specific projects with identifiable goals, such as autonomous tanks and battle management systems. By 1974, funding for AI projects was hard to find. (only the sections before 1980 apply to the current discussion). AI researcher Hans Moravec blamed the crisis on the unrealistic predictions of his colleagues: \\"Many researchers were caught up in a web of increasing exaggeration. Their initial promises to DARPA had been much too optimistic. Of course, what they delivered stopped considerably short of that. But they felt they couldn't in their next proposal promise less than in the first one, so they promised more.\\" The result, Moravec claims, is that some of the staff at DARPA had lost patience with AI research. \\"It was literally phrased at DARPA that 'some of these people were going to be taught a lesson having their two-million-dollar-a-year contracts cut to almost nothing!'\\" Moravec told Daniel Crevier. While the autonomous tank project was a failure, the battle management system (the Dynamic Analysis and Replanning Tool) proved to be enormously successful, saving billions in the first Gulf War, repaying all of DARPAs investment in AI and justifying DARPA's pragmatic policy.  The SUR debacle  DARPA was deeply disappointed with researchers working on the Speech Understanding Research program at Carnegie Mellon University. DARPA had hoped for, and felt it had been promised, a system that could respond to voice commands from a pilot. The SUR team had developed a system which could recognize spoken English, but only if the words were spoken in a particular order. DARPA felt it had been duped and, in 1974, they cancelled a three million dollar a year grant. (on whom this account is based). Other views include and under \\"Success in Speech Recognition\\". Many years later, several successful commercial speech recognition systems would use the technology developed by the Carnegie Mellon team (such as hidden Markov models) and the market for speech recognition systems would reach $4 billion by 2001. under \\"Success in Speech Recognition\\".  The setbacks of the late 1980s and early 1990s = The 1987 collapse of the LISP machine market  In the 1980s, a form of AI program called an \\"expert system\\" was adopted by corporations around the world. The first commercial expert system was XCON, developed at Carnegie Mellon for Digital Equipment Corporation, and it was an enormous success: it was estimated to have saved the company 40 million dollars over just six years of operation. Corporations around the world began to develop and deploy expert systems and by 1985 they were spending over a billion dollars on AI, most of it to in-house AI departments. An industry grew up to support them, including software companies like Teknowledge and Intellicorp (KEE), and hardware companies like Symbolics and LISP Machines Inc. who built specialized computers, called LISP machines, that were optimized to process the programming language LISP, the preferred language for AI. In 1987, three years after Minsky and Schank's prediction, the market for specialized AI hardware collapsed. Workstations by companies like Sun Microsystems offered a powerful alternative to LISP machines and companies like Lucid offered a LISP environment for this new class of workstations. The performance of these general workstations became an increasingly difficult challenge for LISP Machines. Companies like Lucid and Franz LISP offered increasingly powerful versions of LISP that were portable to all UNIX systems. For example, benchmarks were published showing workstations maintaining a performance advantage over LISP machines. Later desktop computers built by Apple and IBM would also offer a simpler and more popular architecture to run LISP applications on. By 1987, some of them had become as powerful as the more expensive LISP machines. The desktop computers had rule-based engines such as CLIPS available.Avoiding another AI Winter, James Hendler, IEEE Intelligent Systems (March/April 2008 (Vol. 23, No. 2) pp. 2‚Äì4 These alternatives left consumers with no reason to buy an expensive machine specialized for running LISP. An entire industry worth half a billion dollars was replaced in a single year. Commercially, many LISP companies failed, like Symbolics, LISP Machines Inc., Lucid Inc., etc. Other companies, like Texas Instruments and Xerox, abandoned the field. However, a number of customer companies (that is, companies using systems written in LISP and developed on LISP machine platforms) continued to maintain systems. In some cases, this maintenance involved the assumption of the resulting support work.  Slowdown in deployment of expert systems  By the early 1990s, the earliest successful expert systems, such as XCON, proved too expensive to maintain. They were difficult to update, they could not learn, they were \\"brittle\\" (i.e., they could make grotesque mistakes when given unusual inputs), and they fell prey to problems (such as the qualification problem) that had been identified years earlier in research in nonmonotonic logic. Expert systems proved useful, but only in a few special contexts. Another problem dealt with the computational hardness of truth maintenance efforts for general knowledge. KEE used an assumption-based approach (see NASA, TEXSYS) supporting multiple-world scenarios that was difficult to understand and apply. The few remaining expert system shell companies were eventually forced to downsize and search for new markets and software paradigms, like case-based reasoning or universal database access. The maturation of Common Lisp saved many systems such as ICAD which found application in knowledge-based engineering. Other systems, such as Intellicorp's KEE, moved from LISP to a C++ (variant) on the PC and helped establish object-oriented technology (including providing major support for the development of UML (see UML Partners).  The end of the Fifth Generation project  In 1981, the Japanese Ministry of International Trade and Industry set aside $850 million for the Fifth Generation computer project. Their objectives were to write programs and build machines that could carry on conversations, translate languages, interpret pictures, and reason like human beings. By 1991, the impressive list of goals penned in 1981 had not been met. Indeed, some of them had not been met in 2001, or 2011. As with other AI projects, expectations had run much higher than what was actually possible.  Strategic Computing Initiative cutbacks  In 1983, in response to the fifth generation project, DARPA again began to fund AI research through the Strategic Computing Initiative. As originally proposed the project would begin with practical, achievable goals, which even included artificial general intelligence as long term objective. The program was under the direction of the Information Processing Technology Office (IPTO) and was also directed at supercomputing and microelectronics. By 1985 it had spent $100 million and 92 projects were underway at 60 institutions, half in industry, half in universities and government labs. AI research was generously funded by the SCI. Jack Schwarz, who ascended to the leadership of IPTO in 1987, dismissed expert systems as \\"clever programming\\" and cut funding to AI \\"deeply and brutally\\", \\"eviscerating\\" SCI. Schwarz felt that DARPA should focus its funding only on those technologies which showed the most promise, in his words, DARPA should \\"surf\\", rather than \\"dog paddle\\", and he felt strongly AI was not \\"the next wave\\". Insiders in the program cited problems in communication, organization and integration. A few projects survived the funding cuts, including pilot's assistant and an autonomous land vehicle (which were never delivered) and the DART battle management system, which (as noted above) was successful.  Developments post-AI winter  A survey of reports from the early 2000s suggests that AI's reputation was still less than stellar: * Alex Castro, quoted in The Economist, 7 June 2007: \\"[Investors] were put off by the term 'voice recognition' which, like 'artificial intelligence', is associated with systems that have all too often failed to live up to their promises.\\"Alex Castro in Are you talking to me? The Economist Technology Quarterly (7 June 2007) * Patty Tascarella in Pittsburgh Business Times, 2006: \\"Some believe the word 'robotics' actually carries a stigma that hurts a company's chances at funding.\\"Robotics firms find fundraising struggle, with venture capital shy. By Patty Tascarella. Pittsburgh Business Times (11 August 2006) * John Markoff in the New York Times, 2005: \\"At its low point, some computer scientists and software engineers avoided the term artificial intelligence for fear of being viewed as wild-eyed dreamers.\\" Many researchers in AI in the mid 2000s deliberately called their work by other names, such as informatics, machine learning, analytics, knowledge-based systems, business rules management, cognitive systems, intelligent systems, intelligent agents or computational intelligence, to indicate that their work emphasizes particular tools or is directed at a particular sub-problem. Although this may be partly because they consider their field to be fundamentally different from AI, it is also true that the new names help to procure funding by avoiding the stigma of false promises attached to the name \\"artificial intelligence\\".  AI integration  In the late 1990s and early 21st century, AI technology became widely used as elements of larger systems, under \\"Artificial Intelligence in the 90s\\" but the field is rarely credited for these successes. In 2006, Nick Bostrom explained that \\"a lot of cutting edge AI has filtered into general applications, often without being called AI because once something becomes useful enough and common enough it's not labeled AI anymore.\\"AI set to exceed human brain power CNN.com (26 July 2006) Rodney Brooks stated around the same time that \\"there's this stupid myth out there that AI has failed, but AI is around you every second of the day.\\" Technologies developed by AI researchers have achieved commercial success in a number of domains, such as machine translation, data mining, industrial robotics, logistics, speech recognition,For the new state of the art in AI- based speech recognition, see Are You Talking to Me? banking software,\\"AI- inspired systems were already integral to many everyday technologies such as internet search engines, bank software for processing transactions and in medical diagnosis.\\" Nick Bostrom, AI set to exceed human brain power CNN.com (26 July 2006) medical diagnosis, and Google's search engine.For the use of AI at Google, see Google's man behind the curtain, Google backs character recognition and Spying an intelligent search engine. Fuzzy logic controllers have been developed for automatic gearboxes in automobiles (the 2006 Audi TT, VW TouaregTouareg Short Lead Press Introduction, Volkswagen of America and VW Caravell feature the DSP transmission which utilizes fuzzy logic, a number of ≈†koda variants (≈†koda Fabia) also currently include a fuzzy logic-based controller). Camera sensors widely utilize fuzzy logic to enable focus. Heuristic search and data analytics are both technologies that have developed from the evolutionary computing and machine learning subdivision of the AI research community. Again, these techniques have been applied to a wide range of real world problems with considerable commercial success. Data analytics technology utilizing algorithms for the automated formation of classifiers that were developed in the supervised machine learning community in the 1990s (for example, TDIDT, Support Vector Machines, Neural Nets, IBL) are now used pervasively by companies for marketing survey targeting and discovery of trends and features in data sets.  AI funding  Researchers and economists frequently judged the status of an AI winter by reviewing which AI projects were being funded, how much and by whom. Trends in funding are often set by major funding agencies in the developed world. Currently, DARPA and a civilian funding program called EU-FP7 provide much of the funding for AI research in the US and European Union. As of 2007, DARPA was soliciting AI research proposals under a number of programs including The Grand Challenge Program, Cognitive Technology Threat Warning System (CT2WS), \\"Human Assisted Neural Devices (SN07-43)\\", \\"Autonomous Real-Time Ground Ubiquitous Surveillance-Imaging System (ARGUS-IS)\\" and \\"Urban Reasoning and Geospatial Exploitation Technology (URGENT)\\" Perhaps best known is DARPA's Grand Challenge ProgramGrand Challenge Home which has developed fully automated road vehicles that can successfully navigate real world terrainDARPA in a fully autonomous fashion. DARPA has also supported programs on the Semantic Web with a great deal of emphasis on intelligent management of content and automated understanding. However James Hendler, the manager of the DARPA program at the time, expressed some disappointment with the government's ability to create rapid change, and moved to working with the World Wide Web Consortium to transition the technologies to the private sector. The EU-FP7 funding program provides financial support to researchers within the European Union. In 2007‚Äì2008, it was funding AI research under the Cognitive Systems: Interaction and Robotics Programme (‚Ç¨193m), the Digital Libraries and Content Programme (‚Ç¨203m) and the FET programme (‚Ç¨185m).Information and Communication Technologies in FP7, overview document for European Union funding. Retrieved 20 September 2007.  Current \\"AI spring\\"  A marked increase in AI funding, development, deployment, and commercial use has led to the idea of the AI winter being long over. Concerns are occasionally raised that a new AI winter could be triggered by overly ambitious or unrealistic promises by prominent AI scientists or overpromising on the part of commercial vendors. The successes of the current \\"AI spring\\" are advances in language translation (in particular, Google Translate), image recognition (spurred by the ImageNet training database) as commercialized by Google Image Search, and in game- playing systems such as AlphaZero (chess champion) and AlphaGo (go champion), and Watson (Jeopardy champion). Most of these advances occurred in the 2010-2017 time period.  Underlying causes behind AI winters  Several explanations have been put forth for the cause of AI winters in general. As AI progressed from government-funded applications to commercial ones, new dynamics came into play. While hype is the most commonly cited cause, the explanations are not necessarily mutually exclusive.  Hype  The AI winters can be partly understood as a sequence of over-inflated expectations and subsequent crash seen in stock-markets and exemplified by the railway mania and dotcom bubble. In a common pattern in the development of new technology (known as hype cycle), an event, typically a technological breakthrough, creates publicity which feeds on itself to create a \\"peak of inflated expectations\\" followed by a \\"trough of disillusionment\\". Since scientific and technological progress can't keep pace with the publicity- fueled increase in expectations among investors and other stakeholders, a crash must follow. AI technology seems to be no exception to this rule. For example, in the 1960s the realization that computers could simulate 1-layer neural networks led to a neural-network hype cycle that lasted until the 1969 publication of the book Perceptrons which severely limited the set of problems that could be optimally solved by 1-layer networks. In 1985 the realization that neural networks could be used to solve optimization problems, as a result of famous papers by Hopfield and Tank , together with the threat of Japan's 5th-generation project, led to renewed interest and application.  Institutional factors  Another factor is AI's place in the organisation of universities. Research on AI often takes the form of interdisciplinary research. AI is therefore prone to the same problems other types of interdisciplinary research face. Funding is channeled through the established departments and during budget cuts, there will be a tendency to shield the \\"core contents\\" of each department, at the expense of interdisciplinary and less traditional research projects.  Economic factors  Downturns in a country's national economy cause budget cuts in universities. The \\"core contents\\" tendency worsens the effect on AI research and investors in the market are likely to put their money into less risky ventures during a crisis. Together this may amplify an economic downturn into an AI winter. It is worth noting that the Lighthill report came at a time of economic crisis in the UK,https://www.theguardian.com/obituaries/story/0,,2122424,00.html obituary of Donald Michie in The Guardian when universities had to make cuts and the question was only which programs should go.  Insufficient computing capability  Early in the computing history the potential for neural networks was understood but it has never been realized. Fairly simple networks require significant computing capacity even by today's standards.  Empty pipeline  It is common to see the relationship between basic research and technology as a pipeline. Advances in basic research give birth to advances in applied research, which in turn leads to new commercial applications. From this it is often argued that a lack of basic research will lead to a drop in marketable technology some years down the line. This view was advanced by James Hendler in 2008, when he claimed that the fall of expert systems in the late '80s was not due to an inherent and unavoidable brittleness of expert systems, but to funding cuts in basic research in the 1970s. These expert systems advanced in the 1980s through applied research and product development, but, by the end of the decade, the pipeline had run dry and expert systems were unable to produce improvements that could have overcome this brittleness and secured further funding.  Failure to adapt  The fall of the LISP machine market and the failure of the fifth generation computers were cases of expensive advanced products being overtaken by simpler and cheaper alternatives. This fits the definition of a low-end disruptive technology, with the LISP machine makers being marginalized. Expert systems were carried over to the new desktop computers by for instance CLIPS, so the fall of the LISP machine market and the fall of expert systems are strictly speaking two separate events. Still, the failure to adapt to such a change in the outside computing milieu is cited as one reason for the 1980s AI winter.  Arguments and debates on past and future of AI  Several philosophers, cognitive scientists and computer scientists have speculated on where AI might have failed and what lies in its future. Hubert Dreyfus highlighted flawed assumptions of AI research in the past and, as early as 1966, correctly predicted that the first wave of AI research would fail to fulfill the very public promises it was making. Other critics like Noam Chomsky have argued that AI is headed in the wrong direction, in part because of its heavy reliance on statistical techniques.Yarden Katz, \\"Noam Chomsky on Where Artificial Intelligence Went Wrong\\", The Atlantic, 1 November 2012 Chomsky's comments fit into a larger debate with Peter Norvig, centered around the role of statistical methods in AI. The exchange between the two started with comments made by Chomsky at a symposium at MITNoam Chomsky, \\"Pinker/Chomsky Q&A; from MIT150 Panel\\" to which Norvig wrote a response.Peter Norvig, \\"On Chomsky and the Two Cultures of Statistical Learning\\"  See also  * AI effect * History of artificial intelligence * Software crisis  Notes  References     * *  Further reading  * Marcus, Gary, \\"Am I Human?: Researchers need new ways to distinguish artificial intelligence from the natural kind\\", Scientific American, vol. 316, no. 3 (March 2017), pp. 58‚Äì63. Multiple tests of artificial-intelligence efficacy are needed because, \\"just as there is no single test of athletic prowess, there cannot be one ultimate test of intelligence.\\" One such test, a \\"Construction Challenge\\", would test perception and physical action‚Äî\\"two important elements of intelligent behavior that were entirely absent from the original Turing test.\\" Another proposal has been to give machines the same standardized tests of science and other disciplines that schoolchildren take. A so far insuperable stumbling block to artificial intelligence is an incapacity for reliable disambiguation. \\"[V]irtually every sentence [that people generate] is ambiguous, often in multiple ways.\\" A prominent example is known as the \\"pronoun disambiguation problem\\": a machine has no way of determining to whom or what a pronoun in a sentence‚Äîsuch as \\"he\\", \\"she\\" or \\"it\\"‚Äîrefers. *  External links  * ComputerWorld article (February 2005) * AI Expert Newsletter (January 2005) * \\"If It Works, It's Not AI: A Commercial Look at Artificial Intelligence startups\\" * Patterns of Software- a collection of essays by Richard P.

Its fossils have been discovered in the Patagonian Portezuelo Formation of Argentina. Initially thought to have been a giant dromaeosaur-like coelurosaur, it was classified as a neovenatorid allosauroid in previous phylogenies, but more recent phylogeny and discoveries of related megaraptoran genera has placed it as either a basal tyrannosauroid or a basal coelurosaur. Description Hypothetical life restoration of an adult Megaraptor head reconstruction based on the juvenile skull Megaraptor was initially described as a giant dromaeosaur, known primarily from a single claw (about 30 cm long) that resembled the sickle-shaped foot claw of dromaeosaurids. The discovery of a complete front limb, however, showed that this giant claw actually came from the first finger of the hand. In 2010, Gregory S. Paul estimated its length at , its weight at .Paul, G.S., 2010, The Princeton Field Guide to Dinosaurs, Princeton University Press p. 99 The hands were unusually elongated, bearing sickle-shaped claws even more recurved than those of spinosaurids.Calvo, J.O., Porfiri, J.D., Gonz√°lez-Riga, B.J., and Kellner, A.W. (2007) \\"A new Cretaceous terrestrial ecosystem from Gondwana with the description of a new sauropod dinosaur\\". Anais da Academia Brasileira de Ci√™ncias, 79(3): 529-41. Classification The hand is quite distinct from other basal tetanurans, so it was not initially clear whether Megaraptor was an allosaurid, a carcharodontosaurid, a spinosauroid, or something else entirely. Subsequent studies, as well as the identification of close relatives with similar large claws on the forelimbs (see below), helped identify Megaraptor as a highly advanced and lightly built allosauroid, and a member of the family Neovenatoridae. More recent studies have proposed that Megaraptor and its kin are actually tyrannosauroids or spinosauroids as opposed to allosauroids. A juvenile specimen described in 2014 has provided more evidence towards Megaraptor being a primitive tyrannosauroid. The discovery of Gualicho indicates that Megaraptor may not be a tyrannosauroid, but either an allosauroid or basal coelurosaur. When first discovered and prior to publication, the spinosaurid Baryonyx was also reported to be a dromaeosaurid, and the allosauroid Chilantaisaurus was reported to be a possible spinosaurid, both based on the large hand claws.

The skeleton of the single specimen was found on a cliff southwest of Laiyang, Shandong Province. It was a bipedal and herbivorous dinosaur. Taxonomy The genus contains only the type species, Micropachycephalosaurus hongtuyanensis. Paleontologist Dong Zhiming originally described it as a member of the Pachycephalosauria, a group of bipedal dome-headed herbivores. However, re- evaluation of the family Pachycephalosauridae by Sullivan in 2006 cast doubt on this assignment.Sullivan, R.M. (2006). \\"A taxonomic review of the Pachycephalosauridae (Dinosauria: Ornithischia).\\" New Mexico Museum of Natural History and Science Bulletin, 35: 347-365. Further study of the original specimens by Butler and Zhao in 2008 also failed to find any characteristics linking Micropachycephalosaurus with the pachycephalosaurs. The one piece of evidence that could provide this link, the supposedly thickened skull roof, was missing from the fossil collection the scientists examined, and so could not be used to support or refute its original classification. Butler and Zhao therefore classified it as an indeterminate member of the Cerapoda. In 2011, cladistic analysis performed by Butler et al. showed that Micropachycephalosaurus is a basal member of the Ceratopsia.

Slogans for the products have included \\"Imported From the Old Neighborhood\\" and \\"Taste of the Town.\\" Hillinger, Charles \\"Drink of the Deli People : Dr. Brown's Cream Soda Making Its Mark Outside of New York\\", Los Angeles Times, July 04, 1986. Accessed December 5, 2014. Dr. Brown's was created in 1869 and was commonly sold in New York delicatessens and by soda salesmen who sold the product from door to door in Jewish neighborhoods. According to former marketing director, Harry Gold, a New York doctor used celery seeds and sugar to invent the soda and celery tonic now known as Cel-Ray, which was advertised as a \\"pure beverage for the nerves.\\"Yin, Sandra The Oxford Encyclopedia of Food and Drink in America, Volume 1, p. 651. However, some have speculated that there may never have been an actual Dr. Brown and that the name may have been only a marketing invention. In the early 1930s, before Coca-Cola received kosher certification, many Jews drank Cel-Ray soda as well as the other flavored soda that had been created by Dr. Brown. In the last 25 years, the cans were redesigned by Herb Lubalin. Each of the six Dr. Brown's flavors is packaged with a New York vignette taken from old prints, to emphasize the brand's origins in 1800s New York. In 2013, J & R Bottling transferred the bottling rights to LA Bottleworks with the bottling of the product then continuing to be at the same facility. As of 2014, Dr. Brown's is produced by PepsiCo in their New York City bottling plant. The Dr. Brown's brand is owned by the Honickman Beverage Group. 12 oz line for Dr. Browns Soda Dr. Brown's varieties include cream soda (regular and diet), black cherry soda (regular and diet), orange soda, ginger ale, root beer, and Cel-Ray (celery-flavored soda). Dr. Brown's soda is typically sold in 12-ounce cans and one-liter plastic bottles, as well as two- liter bottles for the Black Cherry, Cream, and Root Beer flavors.

It is a port city (25¬∞ 16' 29N 64¬∞ 35' 10E) located in the Makran coastal region. It is located west of Karachi and east of Gwadar on the Arabian Sea. This port is also mentioned in Periplus of the Erythraean Sea as Oraea.  History  Ormara beach, west side of the city Going towards Gwadar through the Makran Coastal Highway, Ormara comes in midway between Karachi and Gwadar. Its historical routes are linked with Alexander the Great, who stayed there with his army for a few days on his way back from the Indus region after conquering the lands of Sindh, Punjab and the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa regions of modern-day Pakistan in 400 BC. One of his generals, Ormoz, died there, and the present-day city was named after him. For a few centuries, Ormara remained a battle field between the Baloch Sardar (local feudal) and foreign aggressors. Before independence, it was part of the state of Las Bela and afterward it became part of the Makran Division. Being an isolated town, it remained undeveloped; however, after construction of the Makran Coastal Highway and Jinnah Naval Base, life has taken a positive change for the locals with many local industries and the resultant increase in jobs available for the locals. It has a population of about forty thousand people and still offers a traditional look at how the ancients lived. Most residents make their livelihood from fishing; a few of them also work in Middle Eastern countries. Ormara has witnessed considerable growth in recent years, especially with the foundation of the Makran Coastal Highway, which integrated the area more with the mainstream Pakistani economy and major urban centres allowing for an easier transport of goods, commerce and people.  Transportation  Ormara has a port and fish harbour. The Jinnah Naval Base of the Pakistan Navy is located at Ormara. Ormara Airport (ORW) connects it with rest of Pakistan.

The following nights, the boys are joined, and later replaced, by adult men. The Trychling culminates on 30 December (or the last workday before that date), with the Ubersitz in Meiringen. On this day, the Treichler are carrying frightening masks (except for the people of Unterbach and Hasliberg who remain unmasked)  The different Treichel groups = Meiringen  The Treichel group of Meiringen is the largest one, amounting up to nearly 200 people. They have cow bells and drums and are masked very variously from traditional masks to frightening monster masks. The group is accompanied by a \\"Huttefroueli\\" (an effigy of an old woman). The front 5 of the group are mostly masked the same. The group of Meiringen is known for their fast pace.  Willigen  The Treichel group of Willigen belongs to the 4 largest ones.

The large nature reserve lies on the western boundary of City of Brisbane into the Moreton Bay Region, Queensland, Australia, in Enoggera Reservoir, adjacent to The Gap and between the Mount Coot-tha Reserve on the Taylor Range and higher peaks to the north. Brisbane Forest Park supports plants and animals and is essential to their survival. The main entrance is located in the suburb of The Gap although there are a number of other access points. A number of waterways have their headwaters in the park including South Pine River, Enoggera Creek, Gold Creek, Moggill Creek and its tributary Gap Creek, Cabbage Tree Creek and Cedar Creek, a tributary of Kedron Brook. Lake Manchester Dam, Gold Creek Dam and Enoggera Dam are also located within the park. History Enoggera Reservoir Dam The first national park on the D'Aguilar Range, Maiala National Park was declared in 1930. The park was established by a community group called the Brisbane National & Recreation Park Committee. In 1973 the group released a study on the feasibility of establishing a park between Mount Coot-tha and Mount Nebo. Initially the Brisbane City Council was concerned with the incompatibility of opening a public recreation area in a water supply catchment. A co-ordinating authority was set up to allay concerns and an Act of Parliament was passed in 1977 protecting 25 000 hectares. In 2009, Brisbane Forest Park was renamed and became one of two sections of the D'Aguilar National Park. Walkabout Creek Wildlife Centre Eastern water dragon at the Walk-About Creek Wildlife Centre The Walk-About Creek Wildlife Centre (at the Mount Nebo Road, The Gap, entrance to Brisbane Forest Park) has an information and education centre for Australian wildlife, a large walk-through aviary, aquariums and enclosures for wildlife (including a section for Australian nocturnal animals). The nocturnal section also has a pair of satin bowerbirds. Australian wildlife on display at the Walk-About Wildlife Centre includes Australian native birds, a platypus, sugar gliders, wallabies, pademelons, wombat, spotted-tail quoll, brush-tailed phascogale, bandicoot, potaroo, snakes, lizards, turtles and fish (including lungfish). Public access to Enoggera Dam is via Walkabout Creek Wildlife Centre. Access Brisbane Forest Park is accessible by car. Many walks are possible in the Brisbane Forest Park with boardwalks erected to protect the area and to make it easier for the walkers.

The campus is located south of Chicago, Illinois. GSU was founded in 1969. GSU is a public university offering degree programs at the undergraduate, master's, and doctoral levels. GSU has four colleges: the College of Arts and Sciences, the College of Business, the College of Education, and the College of Health and Human Services.  History  The Paul Bunyan statue on GSU campus, one of many sculptures on campus. Governors State University was established as a state-supported, upper-division institution of education on July 17, 1969, when Illinois Governor Richard B. Ogilvie signed into law House Bill 666. Originally scheduled to open to students in September 1973, the four-year planning period was reduced to two years and GSU received its first class of 500 students in September 1971. The university utilized warehouse space as the temporary home during the campus construction. Under the university's first president, William Engbretson, academic staff created an experimental educational environment focused on a collaborative learning environment between students and faculty in class sessions called modules that met for eight-week sessions. GSU was one of the original \\"Universities without Walls\\" as well as a university that did not offer grades, but competencies. In place of departments, it had interdisciplinary studies, and all professors held the rank of University Professor. The university transitioned from the experimental curriculum to a more traditional model after Engbretson stepped down and Leo Goodman-Malamuth became GSU's second president. GSU developed academic divisions and departments, professors with rank (Assistant Professor, Associate Professor and Professor), and renovated the open space main building to classroom and office space. Structured classes in a trimester schedule, along with traditional transcripts were other changes during the era. Following the original mandate to serve the underserved student populations such as veterans and nontraditional students with some college credits but no degree, the university developed telecourses in the 1980s. The classes were held in one of GSU's two television studios then were made available via tape or as programming on cable channels. The first doctoral program was created in 2007 as a professional doctoral degree in Physical Therapy. GSU further developed other doctoral programs in nursing, occupational therapy, and education. In 2014, the state approved the university to expand curriculum for freshmen and sophomores. Along with welcoming freshmen and sophomores to campus, the university opened its first on-campus residence hall, known as Prairie Place. The university created small class sizes for freshmen with courses taught by full-time faculty and individual sessions capped at 30 students. Campus The Campus is located south of Chicago. It is within 30 minutes' drive from cities Kankakee and Joliet as well as northwestern Indiana. The main campus is located on a wooded landscape with several lakes and natural trails. Points of interest *The Family Development Center (FDC) provides university- quality programs for children and their parents. The Family Development Center will be the Model Early Education Center for the South Suburbs. GSU Family development center programs model the best practices in Early Childhood Education and draw extensively on the expertise of university faculty and staff in Early Childhood Education, Nursing, Communications Disorders (speech and hearing), Psychology and Counseling. University students in these programs at both the undergraduate and graduate levels are active participants in the Family Development Center. The Family Development Center has been nationally recognized for meeting the highest standards of early childhood education. The National Association for the Education of Young Children (NAEYC), the nation's leading professional organization working on behalf of young children, has awarded accreditation to the FDC. *GSU is also home to the Center for Performing Arts, which draws entertainers and artists from around the world, as well as the local community. The Illinois Philharmonic Orchestra held monthly concerts on a fall through spring seasonal schedule throughout the 2007‚Äì2008 season. *Ethnographic Arts Collection, owned by the University Foundation of Governors State University, the beginning of the Ethnographic Collection dates nearly from the beginning of the University. Objects were generously donated by former faculty, students, and patrons for the purpose of direct instruction in art history classes and ethnic studies so that students might know first hand and be able to study and handle examples from various regions of the world. Initially, some examples were accepted that are not of prime \\"museum quality\\" but retained value as teaching objects. Yet over the years donations from generous collectors increasingly included objects of the highest quality and included multiple examples from certain ethnic contexts. Sustainability Governors State University Solar-thermal Systems In 2008, GSU renovated several parking lots, replacing asphalt with permeable pavers‚Äîinterlocking bricks that allow rainwater to seep down, trapping heavy metals and pollutants before they enter storm sewers. GSU is also home to one of the state's largest solar-thermal systems, which preheats water for the campus swimming pool and provides about one-third of the domestic hot water for the university's main building. Governors State University's Wind Turbine On October 21, 2010, Warren Ribley, director of the Illinois Department of Commerce and Economic Opportunity, announced a $153,000 grant for the 50-kilowatt wind turbine to be located on the University Park campus. With the installation of an on-campus wind turbine, Governors State University will continue reducing its greenhouse gas emissions, and move toward its goal of becoming Illinois‚Äô \\"greenest\\" university. The wind turbine will give Governors State a clean, renewable source of energy, and also be incorporated into the university's academic programs. On October 18, 2011, GSU held a groundbreaking ceremony for the beginning of the renovation of the university's science facilities. The $22.6 million, three year renovation project will create state-of-the-art education facilities while providing more than 130 construction jobs. In addition to the positive impact the renovation project will have on the region's economy, the building renovation will better equip GSU to educate students for regional jobs in healthcare, computer science, scientific, and mathematics research, and science and math education. The area to be renovated comprises approximately of space. During the renovation, crews will replace HVAC, electrical, plumbing, and lighting systems. Outmoded infrastructure and equipment will be replaced with modern facilities and equipment that will be energy-efficient and meet current codes and regulations. The project design calls for structural infill of existing atrium space, adding about of additional usable space. The renovated facilities will serve students and faculty in biology, chemistry, computer science, mathematics, nursing, communication disorders, occupational therapy, and physical therapy.

Located in liver cytosol, ASL is the fourth enzyme of the urea cycle and involved in the biosynthesis of arginine in all species and the production of urea in ureotelic species.; Mutations in ASL, resulting low activity of the enzyme, increase levels of urea in the body and result in various side effects. The ASL gene is located on chromosome 7 between the centromere (junction of the long and short arm) and the long (q) arm at position 11.2, from base pair 64,984,963 to base pair 65,002,090. ASL is related to intragenic complementation. Structure ASL is composed of four identical monomers; each monomer consisting of a single polypeptide chain between 49 and 52 kDa, between 196 and 208 kDa for the entire tetrameric enzyme. Each monomer has three highly conserved regions remote from one another, but these regions cluster together in the tetramer to form four active sites. Therefore, each ASL homotetramer has four active sites to catalyze the breakdown of argininosuccinate. Each monomer in the ASL homotetramer is composed of three structural domains; all three are primarily alpha helical. Domains 1 and 3 are similar in structure as they both consist of helix-turn-helix motifs. Domain 1 of the monomer contains the amino terminus. Domain 2 contains one small beta sheet, nine alpha helices, and the carboxyl terminus. Three of the nine alpha helices on one monomer are engaged mainly in hydrophobic interactions with another monomer to form a dimer. Two dimers then associate by way of alpha helix, one from each monomer, to form a central 20-helix core. The association of all four monomers allows for the catalytic activity at each possible active site. Intragenic complementation Multiple copies of a polypeptide encoded by a gene often can form an aggregate referred to as a multimer. When a multimer is formed from polypeptides produced by two different mutant alleles of a particular gene, the mixed multimer may exhibit greater functional activity than the unmixed multimers formed by each of the mutants alone. When a mixed multimer displays increased functionality relative to the unmixed multimers, the phenomenon is referred to as intragenic complementation. In humans, ASL is a multimer (tetramer) protein. An ASL disorder in humans can arise from mutations in the ASL gene, particularly mutations that affect the active site of the mutant multimer protein. ASL disorder is associated with considerable clinical and genetic heterogeneity which is considered to reflect the extensive intragenic complementation occurring among individual patients. Mechanism alt=slide 1 alt=active site The enzyme's cleavage of the argininosuccinate, to form fumarate and arginine, occurs through an E1cb elimination reaction. The base initiates the reaction by deprotonating the carbon adjacent to the arginine, or leaving group. Recent mutagenic studies of ASL homologues have shown that Histidine 162 or Threonine 161 of ASL is responsible for the proton abstraction of the CŒ≤, either directly or indirectly through a water molecule. Lysine 289 is thought to stabilize the negatively charged carbanion intermediate. Although there is no consensus of the catalytic acid that donates the proton to the imine functional group of the arginine product, some mutagenesis studies show serine 283 may be involved. Role in the urea cycle Ammonia (NH3) is a toxic substance for many aerobic organisms and must be excreted. Some aquatic organisms release the toxin right directly into their environment, while other ureotelic species must convert their toxic nitrogen waste into non-toxic components, like uric acid or urea, through a series of catalyzed steps better known as the urea cycle. ASL catalyzes the fourth step in the cycle, following the action of argininosuccinate synthetase (ASS) in the liver cytosol. While ASS catalyzes the formation of argininosuccinate from citrulline and aspartate, ASL breaks the newly formed argininosuccinate into L-arginine and fumarate. L-arginine continues through the urea cycle to form urea and ornithine, while fumarate can enter the citric acid cycle. Œ¥-Crystallin ASL, Œ¥-crystallin, class II fumarase, aspartase, adenylosuccinase lyase, and 3-carboxy-cis and cis-muconate lactonizing enzyme are all members of the same homotetrameric superfamily of enzymes, in which most catalyze the same type of elimination reactions where a C-O or C-N bond is broken and fumarate is released as a product. Œ¥-crystallins are the major structural eye lens water- soluble proteins of most birds, reptiles, and some other vertebrates. Within the superfamily, ASL is most closely related to Œ¥-crystallin in amino acid sequence and in protein fold structure. There are two isoforms of Œ¥-crystallin, Œ¥I and Œ¥II. These two isoforms conserve 69% and 71% of the ASL amino acid sequence, respectively, but only the Œ¥II isoform retains the same enzymatic activity as ASL. The similarities have led researches to believe that these crystallins have evolved from the recruitment to the lens of preexisting metabolic enzymes, like ASL, by a process called 'gene sharing'. The same gene product functions as both a lens crystallin and an enzyme in other non-ocular tissues. Comparative studies of the Œ¥-crystallins have been beneficial for understanding the enzymatic mechanism of the ASL reaction. Mutations and ASL deficiencies: argininosuccinic aciduria Mutations in the human ASL gene causes argininosuccinic aciduria, a rare autosomal recessive disorder, and results in deficiencies of the urea cycle. Argininosuccinate lyase is an intermediate enzyme in the urea synthesis pathway and its function is imperative to the continuation of the cycle. A non-functioning enzyme results in patients' accumulation of ammonia, argininosuccinate, and citrulline in the blood, and argininosuccinate is excreted in the urine. Other resulting symptoms include lethargy, vomiting, hypothermia, hyperventilation, hepatomegaly and progressive encephalopathy in infant patients, and abnormal hair growth, hepatic fibrosis, episodic vomiting, growth and developmental delay, in patients experiencing the disorder later in childhood. ASL is a key enzyme in the conversion of ammonia to urea through the urea cycle. Ammonia builds to toxic levels, resulting in hyperammonemia. Ammonia is toxic in part because it affects the nervous system. There is biochemical evidence that shows rises in ammonia can inhibit glutaminase and therefore limit the rate of synthesis of neurotransmitters such as glutamate, which can explain the developmental delay in argininosuccinic aciduria patients. One mutation in patients with argininosuccinic aciduria occurs when glutamine 286 is mutated to arginine. The enzyme now has a positively charged arginine in place of a neutrally charged glutamine and studies suggest this change may sterically and/or electrostatically hinder a conformational change necessary for catalysis.

He died at the town named after him, Saint-Ghislain (Ursidongus). He was probably of German origin. Ghislain lived in the province of Hainaut in the time of Amandus (d. 679) and saints Waltrude, Aldegonde, and Amalberga of Maubeuge. With two unknown disciples he made a clearing in the vicinity of Castrilocus (now Mons, in Hainault), taking up later his abode at a place called Ursidongus, where he built an oratory or chapel dedicated to Saint Peter and Paul the Apostle. Aubert of Avranches summoned him to the episcopal presence in order to sound the intentions of this almost unknown hermit, but he afterwards accorded him efficient protection. During his visit to Cambrai, Ghislain spent some time in the villa of Roisin and received as a gift the estates of Celles and Hornu. He soon entered into relations with Waltrude, who was induced by him to build a monastery at Castrilocus, his former place of refuge. It is probable that Ghislain influenced the religious vocation of Aldegonde, Abbess of Maubeuge, also of Amalberga and Aldetrude, of whom the first was the sister and the last two the daughters of Waltrude. One day Aldegonde in her monastery of Maubeuge, had a vision in which, according to her biographer, the death of Amandus, Bishop of Tongeren, was revealed to her. Ghislain visited the saint in her villa of Mairieu, near Maubeuge, and explained to her that the vision was an announcement of her own approaching death. The intercourse between Ghislain and Aldegonde brought about a perfect understanding between Maubeuge and the monastery founded at Ursidongus under Ghislain's direction. St. Waudru rewarded her counsellor with a portion of the villa of Frameries and of the oratory of Saint-Quentin, comprised within the boundaries of the villa of Quaregnon. Veneration Ghislain died at Ursidongus, and the monastery which he had founded took his name. The relics of the saint were first disinterred c. 929. They were transferred to Grandlieu, near Quaregnon, about the end of the tenth century or the beginning of the eleventh, and in 1025 Gerard of Florennes, Bishop of Cambrai, removed them to Le Cateau-Cambr√©sis. They were visited several times in the course of the Middle Ages by the bishops of Cambrai. In 1647 they were removed to St- Ghislain of which place he is patron. His feast is celebrated on 9 October and his intercession is sought to protect children from convulsions. In iconography he is frequently represented with a bear or bear's cub beside him. This is an allusion to the popular legend which relates that a bear, pursued in the chase by King Dagobert I, sought refuge with Ghislain and later showed him the place where he should establish a monastery. Moreover, the site of the saint's cella was called Ursidongus, \\"bear's den\\".

Although little known in comparison to similar work on what became the internet, the VLSI Project is likely one of the most influential research projects in modern computer history. Its offspring include BSD Unix, the RISC processor concept, many CAD tools still in use today, 32-bit graphics workstations, fabless design houses and its own fab, MOSIS, starting in 1981. A similar DARPA project partnering with industry, VHSIC, is generally considered to have had little or no impact. The VLSI Project is credited as central in promoting the Mead & Conway revolution throughout industry. Project The Project was the brainchild of Caltech professor Carver Mead and Xerox PARC programmer Lynn Conway in the late 1970s. At the time, microprocessor design was plateauing at the 100,000 transistor level because the tools available to the designers were simply unable to deal with more complex designs. 16-bit and 16/32-bit designs were coming to market, but beyond that seemed too difficult and expensive to contemplate. Mead and Conway felt that there was no theoretical problem impeding progress, simply a number of practical ones, and set about solving these in order to make much more complex designs possible. One of the primary efforts under VLSI was the creation of the hardware and software needed to automate the design process, which at that point was still largely manual. For a design containing hundreds of thousands of transistors, there was simply no machine short of a supercomputer that had the memory and performance needed to work on the design as a whole. To address this problem, and thereby allow \\"average\\" companies to use automated tools, VLSI funded the Geometry Engine and Pixel-Planes projects at Stanford University and University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill (respectively) to create suitable graphics hardware at the desktop level. The former evolved into an effort to design a networked CAD workstation, known as the Stanford University Network. This is better known today under its acronym, \\"SUN\\", as in Sun Microsystems, which commercialized the design. To provide a common software platform to run these new tools, VLSI also funded a Berkeley project to provide a standardized Unix implementation, known today as the Berkeley Software Distribution (BSD). Almost all early workstations used BSD, including designs that evolved into Sun, SGI, Apollo Computer, and others. BSD later spawned several descendants, OpenBSD, FreeBSD, NetBSD, and DragonFlyBSD. CAD software was an important part of the VLSI effort. This led to major improvements in CAD technology for layout, design rule checking, and simulation. The tools developed in this program were used extensively in both academic research programs and in industry. The ideas were developed in commercial implementations by companies such as VLSI Technology, Cadnetix, and Synopsis. With these tools in hand, other VLSI funded projects were able to make huge strides in design complexity, sparking off the RISC revolution. The two major VLSI-related projects were Berkeley RISC and Stanford MIPS, both of which relied heavily on the tools developed in previous VLSI projects. To allow design teams to produce test examples, the project also funded the building of their own fabrication facility, MOSIS (Metal Oxide Semiconductor Implementation Service), which received plans electronically. MOSIS remains in operation today. Another important part of the MOSIS fabrication process was the development of the multichip wafer, which allowed a single wafer of silicon to be used to produce several chip designs at the same time. Previously a wafer would normally be used to produce a single design, which meant that there was a definite minimum production run one could consider starting up. In contrast, the multichip wafer a small batch of a chip design could be produced in the middle of a larger run, dramatically lowering the startup cost and prototyping stage.

He was one of the principal composers of dramma giocoso immediately before Mozart.  Life and career  Gassmann was born in Br√ºx, Bohemia, and was most likely trained by Johann Woborschil, the local chorus master. His father was a goldsmith who may well have opposed his son's choice of a musical career. From 1757 until 1762, he wrote an opera every year for the carnival season in Venice, and was also appointed choirmaster in the girls‚Äô conservatory in Venice in 1757. Many of the librettos he set were by the renowned Venetian playwright Carlo Goldoni. In 1763 he was called to Vienna as court ballet composer, and was held in great affection by Emperor Joseph II. In 1764 he was appointed chamber composer to the Emperor, and in 1772 court conductor. In 1766 Gassmann met up- and-coming young Antonio Salieri in Venice, invited him to return with him to Vienna and taught him composition using Johann Joseph Fux‚Äôs textbook Gradus ad Parnassum. Salieri remained in Vienna, and succeeded Gassmann as chamber composer to the Emperor on the latter's death in 1774. Another Italian composer, Giuseppe Bonno, succeeded Gassmann as court conductor. In 1771, Gassmann founded the Tonk√ºnstler-Societ√§t (Society of Musical Artists), which was the first group in Vienna to give concerts for the general public, and for the benefit of its members' widows and orphans. He wrote his oratorio La Betulia liberata for that purpose. In 1774, he died in Vienna from long-term consequences of a carriage accident sustained on his final visit to Italy. Gassmann's two daughters, Anna Fuchs and Therese Rosenbaum, were both famous singers trained by Salieri; the younger, Therese, made a particular name for herself as a Mozart interpreter. Charles Burney, in one of his published accounts of his many European tours surveying the musical scene, recalls, on a visit to Joseph II and his court, meeting Gassmann and finding him very forthcoming. Among the manuscripts Gassmann showed him, he reserved most of his praise for his chamber works. Burney was either not exposed to, or said nothing about, Gassmann's orchestral music.Heartz, Daniel (1995). (Norton, 411-2). .

Monoclonius was named by Edward Drinker Cope in 1876. Later, much taxonomic confusion was caused by the discovery of Centrosaurus, a very similar genus of ceratopsian that is known from much better remains. Today, typical Monoclonius specimens are usually believed to be juveniles or subadults, in many cases of other genera such as Centrosaurus. Those specimens that remain under the name Monoclonius are mostly too incomplete or immature to be confidently matched with adult specimens from the same time and place. This is especially true of the type species, Monoclonius crassus. Therefore, Monoclonius is now usually considered a nomen dubium, pending further study. History=Cope's initial discoveries M. crassus and M. sphenocerus holotypes Monoclonius was Edward Drinker Cope's third named ceratopsian, after Agathaumas and Polyonax. Several fossils were found by Cope, assisted by a young Charles Hazelius Sternberg, in the summer of 1876 near the Judith River in Chouteau County, Montana, only about a hundred miles (some 150 km) from the site of the Battle of the Little Bighorn, fought that June. The finds did not represent a single, let alone articulated, skeleton, but came from different locations. Together they included elements of most parts of the animal (only the feet were entirely missing), including the base part of a long nasal horn, part of the skull frill, brow horns, three fused cervical vertebrae, a sacrum, a shoulder girdle, an ilium, an ischium, two thighbones, a shinbone, a fibula and parts of a forelimb. Just two weeks after leaving Montana, Cope hastily described and named these finds on 30 October 1876 as the type species Monoclonius crassus. The specific name means \\"the fat one\\" in Latin. Since the ceratopsians had not been recognised yet as a distinctive group, Cope was uncertain about much of the fossil material, not recognizing the nasal horn core, nor the brow horns, as part of a fossil horn. The skull frill he interpreted as an episternum, an ossified part of the breastbone, and the fused cervicals he assumed to be anterior dorsals. Contrary to what was stated in most popular or technical science publications prior to 1992, the name Monoclonius does not mean \\"single horn\\" or refer to its distinctive single nasal horn. In fact, the genus was named before it was known to have been a horned dinosaur, and had previously been considered a \\"hadrosaur\\". The name in fact means \\"single sprout\\", from Greek ŒºœåŒΩŒøœÇ, monos, \\"single\\", and Œ∫ŒªœâŒΩŒØŒøŒΩ, klonion, \\"sprout\\", in reference to the way its teeth grew compared to its relative Diclonius (\\"double sprout\\"), which was named by Edward Drinker Cope in the same paper as Monoclonius. In Diclonius, Cope interpreted the fossils to show two series of teeth in use at one time (one mature set and one sprouting replacement set), while in Monoclonius, there appeared to be only one set of teeth in use as a chewing surface at any one time, with replacement teeth growing in only after mature teeth had fallen out. This salient feature of the tooth, which specimen is now lost, almost certainly precludes it from being centrosaurine: it probably indeed is hadrosaurian and was by mistake associated with the rest of the type material. M. recurvicornis holotype After Othniel Charles Marsh's description of Triceratops in 1889, Cope reexamined his Monoclonius specimen and realized that Triceratops, Monoclonius, and Agathaumas represented a group of similar dinosaurs. In the same year he redescribed Monoclonius as having a large nasal horn and two smaller horns over the eyes and a large frill, of which the parietal bone had been found with broad openings. In the same paper in which Cope examined M. crassus, he also named three more Monoclonius species. The first was Monoclonius recurvicornis, meaning \\"with a recurved horn\\", based on specimen AMNH 3999, a short curved nasal horncore and two brow horns, that he had already reported in 1877 but not associated with M. crassus. The second was Monoclonius sphenocerus, the \\"wedge-horned\\" from Greek œÉœïŒ∑ŒΩœåœÇ, sph√®nos, \\"wedge\\", based on specimen AMNH 3989, a long nasal horn, found by Sternberg in 1876 on Cow Island in the Missouri. The third species was Monoclonius fissus, \\"the split one\\", based on specimen AMNH 3988, a pterygoid that Cope assumed to be a split squamosal. In 1895, for financial reasons, Cope was forced to sell a large part of his collection to the American Museum of Natural History. This included his Monoclonius specimens that thus received AMNH inventory numbers. The M. crassus fossils were catalogued as AMNH 3998. Although John Bell Hatcher had been one of Marsh's workers and therefore in the 'Yale Camp' of the Bone Wars, the rivalry between Cope and Marsh, after the death of both he was invited to complete Marsh's monograph on the Ceratopsia also using Cope's material. Hatcher was very critical of Cope's collecting methods. Cope rarely identified specimens in the field with precise locations and often ended up describing composites, rather than single individuals. Hatcher reexamined the presumed type specimen of M. crassus and concluded it in fact represented several individual animals and thus was a series of syntypes. Therefore, he selected one of these as the lectotype, the name-bearing fossil, and chose the distinctive left parietal, forming the dorsal part of the neck frill. The several squamosals, sides of the frill, in the collection could not be associated to this lectotype and he did not believe that Cope's orbital horn (catalogued under a different number) belonged to it. This analysis was eventually, after Hatcher had deceased also, published by Richard Swann Lull in 1907.Hatcher, J.B., Marsh O.C. and Lull, R.S., 1907, The Ceratopsia, Monographs of the United States Geological Survey 49, 198 pages Centrosaurus intrudes The \\"Monoclonius nasicornus\\" skeleton (material now more usually classified in Centrosaurus or Styracosaurus). In the years after Cope's 1889 paper, it appears that there was a tendency to describe any ceratopsid material from the Judith River beds as Monoclonius. The first dinosaur species described from Canada were ceratopsians, in 1902 by Lawrence Lambe, including three new species of Monoclonius based on fragmentary skulls. Two of these, Monoclonius belli and Monoclonius canadensis, were later seen as two species within separate genera: Chasmosaurus belli and Eoceratops canadensis. The third, Monoclonius dawsoni, of which the epitheton honoured George Mercer Dawson, was based on a partial skull, specimen NMC 1173. To this species a parietal was referred, specimen NMC 971. However, in 1904, Lambe decided that this parietal represented a different species and genus that he named Centrosaurus apertus. With newer specimens collected by Charles H. Sternberg, it became accepted that Centrosaurus was distinctly separate from Monoclonius, at least by Lambe. This was challenged in a 1914 paper by Barnum Brown who reviewed Monoclonius and Centrosaurus, dismissing most of Cope's species, leaving only M. crassus. Comparing the parietals of Monoclonius and Centrosaurus, he concluded that any differences were caused by the fact that the M. crassus lectotype had been that of an old animal and damaged by erosion. This would mean that the two were synonymous, with the name Monoclonius having priority. In the same paper he named another species: Monoclonius flexus, \\"the curved one\\", based on specimen AMNH 5239, a skull found in 1912 and featuring a forward curving nasal horn. In 1915, Lambe answered Brown in another paper ‚Äî the review of the Ceratopsia in which Lambe established three families ‚Äî transferring M. dawsoni to Brachyceratops and M. sphenocerus to Styracosaurus. This left M. crassus, which he considered non- diagnostic, largely due to its damage and the lack of a nasal horn. Lambe ended the paper by referring Brown's M. flexus to Centrosaurus apertus, the type species of Centrosaurus. The next round fell in 1917 to Brown in a paper on Albertan centrosaurines, which, for the first time, analyzed a complete ceratopsian skeleton, specimen AMNH 5351 found by him in 1914, which he named Monoclonius nasicornus (\\"with the nose-horn\\"). In the same paper he described yet another species, Monoclonius cutleri, the epithet honouring William Edmund Cutler, based on specimen AMNH 5427, a headless skeleton featuring skin impressions. The matter bounced back and forth, over the next few years, until R.S. Lull published his \\"Revision of the Ceratopsia\\", in 1933. Although, unlike the 1907 monograph, it has relatively few illustrations, it attempted to identify and locate all ceratopsian specimens then known. Lull described another almost complete specimen from Alberta: AMNH 5341, presently exhibited as YPM 2015 at Yale's Peabody Museum in an unusual way: the left half shows the skeleton, but the right side is a reconstruction of the living animal, and referred it to a Monoclonius (Centrosaurus) flexus. Lull had decided that Centrosaurus was a junior synonym of Monoclonius, but distinct enough to deserve subgeneric rank; he therefore also created a Monoclonius (Centrosaurus) apertus. Charles Mortram Sternberg, son of Charles H. Sternberg, in 1938 firmly established the existence of Monoclonius-type forms in Alberta ‚Äî no further specimens had come from Montana since 1876 ‚Äî and claimed that differences justified the separation of the two genera. Monoclonius-types were rarer and found in earlier horizons than Centrosaurus- types, seemingly indicating that the one would be ancestral to the other. In 1940 C.M. Sternberg named another species: Monoclonius lowei. The specific name honoured his field assistant Harold D'acre Robinson Lowe from Drumheller who had worked six field seasons, during the 1925-1937 period, with him across southern Alberta, with other work in Manitoba and Saskatchewan. He created yet another combination in 1949, renaming Brachyceratops montanensis into Monoclonius montanensis, a change today no longer accepted. In 1964 Oskar Kuhn renamed Centrosaurus longirostris into Monoclonius longirostris.Kuhn, O., 1964, Ornithischia: Fossilium Catalogus I, Animalia, pars 105, 80 pp In 1987 Guy Leahy renamed Styracosaurus albertensis into Monoclonius albertensis;Leahy, G.D., 1987, \\"The gradual extinction of dinosaurs: face or artifact?\\", In: Currie P.M., and Koster, E.H. (eds) Fourth Symposium on Mesozoic Terrestrial Ecosystems, Short Papers pp. 138-143 in 1990 Thomas Lehman renamed Avaceratops lammersi into Monoclonius lammersi.Lehman, T.M. 1990. \\"The ceratopsian subfamily Chasmosaurinae: sexual dimorphism and systematics\\". In: K. Carpenter and P.J. Currie (eds.), Dinosaur Systematics: Perspectives and Approaches, Cambridge University Press, Cambridge pp 211-229 Both names have found no acceptance. Classification Hypothetical restoration During the 1990s, the relation between Monoclonius and Centrosaurus was still contentious. There were three relevant possibilities. The first was that, as Barnum Brown had concluded in 1914, Monoclonius crassus was a valid species and identical to Centrosaurus apertus. In that case Centrosaurus would be a junior synonym and Monoclonius would have priority. The second was that, as Lambe had thought, Monoclonius crassus was a nomen dubium, a species based on fossil material that was so indistinct that no other material could justifiably be associated with it. In that case the name Monoclonius could be disregarded and Monoclonius species other than M. crassus ‚Äî if not nomina dubia or nomina nuda themselves ‚Äî would have to be referred to other genera. The third possibility was that both Monoclonius and Centrosaurus were valid and thus separate. The last position was from 1990 defended by Peter Dodson who claimed that specimen AMNH 3998, the M. crassus lectotype, differed from the Centrosaurus apertus holotype in having a very thin parietal close to the skull frill edge. That this was not simply a matter of individual variation would be proven by the fact that M. lowei had a comparably thin frill.Dodson, P., 1990, \\"On the status of the ceratopsids Monoclonius and Centrosaurus\\". In: Carpenter, K. and Currie, P.J. (eds.). Dinosaur Systematics: Approaches and Perspectives. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge. pp. 231-243 However, in 1997 Scott Sampson and colleagues concluded that the M. crassus lectotype and all comparable Monoclonius specimens referred to nomina dubia because they all represented juveniles or subadult individuals, as could be seen from their juvenile long-grained bone structure. In some cases the adult form is an already-known species, but in others the adult may not yet be known to science. Most centrosaurine species would thus have a \\"Monoclonius\\" phase in their ontogeny, which would explain why such specimens can be found from a wide range in time and space. In 1998 Dodson and Allison Tumarkin argued that the bone structure could also be explained by species-specific pedomorphosis, the retention by adults of juvenile traits. This would be proven by the fact that the holotype of M. lowei, specimen NMC 8790, possessed an interparietal bone, at 609 millimetres in length the longest of any centrosaurine specimen known. The second longest, specimen NMC 5429 of Centrosaurus apertus, is only 545 millimetres long, showing NMC 8790 was not likely a subadult.Tumarkin, A.R. and Dodson, P., 1998, \\"A heterochronic analysis of enigmatic ceratopsids\\", Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology, 18(supplement): 83A However, in 2006 Michael Ryan concluded that the M. lowei holotype was an exceptionally large subadult after all, as shown by a third epiparietal, osteoderm on the frill edge, just beginning to develop, and skull sutures which are not completely closed. Monoclonius crassus was seen as a nomen dubium. Dubious species M. lowei holotype. The developing consensus that Monoclonius crassus is a nomen dubium implies that the genus is in principle constrained to this type species, M. crassus, and in fact to the lectotype frill recovered from the Judith River Formation of Montana; even the other material of the AMNH 3998 inventory number cannot justifiably be referred to it. Most of the other historical Monoclonius species have been referred to other genera or are generally seen as nomina dubia or nomina nuda. *M. crassus Cope, 1876; type species, nomen dubium. *M. recurvicornis was named by Cope in 1889, based on fossils he had originally discovered and described in 1877. The type specimen (AMNH 3999) consisted of a braincase, two straight orbital horns, a partial forward-curved nasal horn, and other isolated fragments. *M. sphenocerus was named by Cope in the same 1889 publication as M. recurvicornis. The type specimen consisted of a premaxilla and a distinctive tall, straight nasal horn. It may be a synonym of Styracosaurus. *M. fissus was also named by Cope in 1889, and based on a bone (AMNH 3988) which he thought was a squamosal that differed from the other species in the size of the attachment areas with the surrounding parts of the skull. The supposed squamosal bone was actually a pterygoid. *M. lowei was named by Charles M. Sternberg in 1940. The current classification of M. lowei is uncertain. It is based on a large, somewhat flattened skull with a small, backward-curved nasal horn. The type and only specimen, CMN 8790, was recovered from the upper strata of the Dinosaur Park Formation in Alberta. C.M. Sternberg pointed out the resemblance of this specimen to Brachyceratops. M. lowei has previously been considered a synonym of M. crassus, but if the type specimen of that species is not considered diagnostic, M. lowei also cannot be placed in the genus Monoclonius. In 2006, Ryan suggested it might represent a subadult individual of either Styracosaurus, Achelousaurus, or Einiosaurus, based on stratigraphy. The validity of M. lowei is held strong by Peter Dodson, who considers it \\"almost certainly a diagnosable species\\" (Dodson 2013). Dodson, P. (1990).

Knight, 1897. In 1897, artist Charles R. Knight painted Monoclonius sphenocerus (classified at the time as a species of Agathaumas) for Cope. Knight based the painting on the partial type skull of M. sphenocerus, with its large nasal horn. This skull may actually belong to the genus today known as Styracosaurus.Sternberg, C. H. (1914). Notes on the Fossil Vertebrates Collected on the Cope Expedition to the Judith River and Cow Island Beds, Montana, in 1876. Science, 134-135. The body was based on a more complete skeleton of the species Triceratops prorsus that had been described by O.C. Marsh. At the time, Monoclonius, Agathaumas, and Triceratops were all thought to be close relatives that differed mainly in the arrangement of the horns and the presence of openings in the frill.AMNH, Department of Vertebrate Paleontology.

Hennessy at Stanford University between 1981 and 1984. MIPS investigated a type of instruction set architecture (ISA) now called Reduced Instruction Set Computer (RISC), its implementation as a microprocessor with very large scale integration (VLSI) semiconductor technology, and the effective exploitation of RISC architectures with optimizing compilers. MIPS, together with the IBM 801 and Berkeley RISC, were the three research projects that pioneered and popularized RISC technology in the mid-1980s. In recognition of the impact MIPS made on computing, Hennessey was awarded the IEEE John von Neumann Medal in 2000 by the IEEE (shared with David A. Patterson), the Eckert-Mauchly Award in 2001 by the Association for Computing Machinery, the Seymour Cray Computer Engineering Award in 2001 by the IEEE Computer Society, and, again with David Patterson, the Turing Award in 2017 by the ACM. The project was initiated in 1981 in response to reports of similar projects at IBM (the 801) and the University of California, Berkeley (the RISC). MIPS was conducted by Hennessy and his graduate students until its conclusion in 1984. Hennessey founded MIPS Computer Systems in the same year to commercialize the technology developed by the project. In 1985, MIPS Computer Systems announced a new ISA, also called MIPS, and its first implementation, the R2000 microprocessor. The commercial MIPS ISA, and its implementations went on to be widely used, appearing in embedded computers, personal computers, workstations, servers, and supercomputers. As of May 2017, the commercial MIPS ISA is owned by Imagination Technologies, and is used mainly in embedded computers. In the late 1980s, a follow-up project called MIPS-X was conducted by Hennessy at Stanford. The MIPS ISA was based on a 32-bit word. It supported 32-bit addressing, and was word-addressed. It was a load/store architecture--all references to memory used load and store instructions that copied data between the main memory and 32 general-purpose registers (GPRs). All other instructions, such as integer arithmetic, operated on the GPRs. It possessed a basic instruction set consisting of instructions for control flow, integer arithmetic, and logical operations. To minimize pipeline stalls, all instructions except for load and store had to be executed in one clock cycle. There were no instructions for integer multiplication or division, or operations for floating-point numbers. The architecture exposed all hazards caused by the five-stage pipeline with delay slots. The compiler scheduled instructions to avoid hazards resulting in incorrect computation whilst simultaneously ensuring that the generated code minimized execution time. MIPS instructions are 16 or 32 bit long. The decision to expose all hazards was motivated by the desire to maximize performance by minimizing critical paths, which interlock circuits lengthened. Instructions were packed into 32-bit instruction words (as MIPS is word-addressed). A 32-bit instruction word could contain two 16-bit operations. These were included to reduce the size of machine code. The MIPS microprocessor was implemented in NMOS logic.

Monolophosaurus was a mid- sized theropod at about 5 metres long. Discovery and naming The restored holotype of M. jiangi, on display at the alt= A nearly complete skeleton of a theropod new to science was discovered by Dong Zhiming in 1981, during stratigraphic exploration for the benefit of the oil industry. The fossil was unearthed until 1984. In 1987, before description in the scientific literature, it was referred to in the press as Jiangjunmiaosaurus, an invalid nomen nudum. In 1992 it was mentioned by Dong Zhiming as Monolophosaurus jiangjunmiaoi,Dong, Z., 1992, Dinosaurian Faunas of China, Ocean Press/Springer-Verlag, Beijing/Berlin. 188 pp and in 1993 by Wayne Grady as Monolophosaurus dongi.Grady, W., 1993, The Dinosaur Project ‚Äî The Story of the Greatest Dinosaur Expedition Ever Mounted, Edmonton: Ex Terra Foundation. Toronto: Macfarlane Walter & Ross. 61 pp These latter names also lacked a description and therefore were nomina nuda as well. In 1993/1994, Zhao Xijin and Philip John Currie named and described the type species Monolophosaurus jiangi. The generic name is derived from Greek ŒºœåŒΩŒøœÇ, monos, \\"single\\", and ŒªœåœÜŒøœÇ or ŒªœåœÜŒ∑, lophos/loph√®, \\"crest\\", in reference to the single crest on the snout. The specific name refers to Jiangjunmiao, an abandoned desert inn near which the fossil was found. Jiangjunmiao means \\"the temple (miao) of the general (jiangjun)\\"; local legend has it that a general was buried here. The holotype IVPP 84019 was discovered in the Junggar Basin, in layers of the Wucaiwan Formation dating from the Bathonian-Callovian. It consists of a rather complete skeleton including the skull, lower jaws, vertebral column and pelvis. The rear of the tail, the shoulder girdle and the limbs are lacking. It represents an adult or subadult individual. The type specimen was restored with plaster to be used in a travelling exhibit. Its left side was encased in foam which has hindered subsequent study. A reconstruction was made of the missing elements to create casts of complete skeletal mounts. In 2010, two studies by Stephen Brusatte, et al redescribed the holotype, at the time still the only specimen known, in detail. In 2006, Thomas Carr suggested that Guanlong, another theropod with a large, thin, and fenestrated midline crest and from the same formation, was in fact a subadult individual of Monolophosaurus. Usually Guanlong had been considered a proceratosaurid tyrannosauroid, but Carr had performed an analysis in which both specimens clustered and were allosauroids. More conservatively, in 2010 Gregory S. Paul renamed Guanlong into a Monolophosaurus species, Monolophosaurus wucaii,Paul, G.S., 2010, The Princeton Field Guide to Dinosaurs, Princeton University Press p. 93-94 presuming the taxa might be sister species. In 2010, Brusatte e.a. rejected the identity, pointing out that the Guanlong holotype was actually a fully adult individual. Description Restoration The type and only known individual has been estimated at . In 2010, Paul estimated the length at 5.5 meters (18 ft) and the weight at 475 kg (1,047 lbs) . In 2016 Molina-P√©rez and Larramendi gave a higher estimation of 7.5 meters (24.6 ft) and 710 kg (1,565 lbs). Several distinguishing traits have been established. The snout on its midline bears a large crest, the front of which is formed by the praemaxillan. It continues to behind over the nasals and lacrimals; its rear touches the frontals. The top of the crest runs parallel to the upper jaw edge. The ascending branches of the praemaxillae each have a forked rear. The side of the praemaxilla features a deep groove running from an opening in the ascending branch towards an opening below the nostril. Within the depression around the upper rear side of the nostril two pneumatic openings are present, of unequal size. The rear branch of the lacrimal, above the eye socket, has a distinctive hatchet-shaped process pointing upwards. The combined frontals are rectangular and elongated with a length:width ratio of 1.67. Mounted skeleton, clearly showing the hood-shaped antitrochanter above the hip joint The holotype skull has a length of eighty centimetres. It is as such rather flat but this is obscured by the presence of a large snout crest occupying about three quarters of the skull length, reaching the level of the eye sockets. Sprouting from the praemaxillae at the snout tip, the crest is largely formed by the nasal bones. Transversely it has a triangular cross-section with a broad base and a more narrow top; this does not form a ridge, however, but has a flat upper surface. The nasal crest side is very rugose with a series of bosses and swellings. The nasal bone contributes to the upper rear part of the depression around the antorbital fenestra. This area shows a number of pneumatic openings or pneumatopores, where diverticula of the air sacks entered the bone. In the front two small foramina are present, more to the rear two large horizontal oval openings. CAT scans showed that internally the nasal bone is heavily pneumatised, with large air chambers. Also the jugal bone is pneumatised. The lacrimal is I-shaped. It has an ascending branch forming the vertical rear edge of the crest; due to the triangular cross- section this branch is inclined towards the midline of the skull. The upper outer side of this branch forms a rectangular boss. Behind the eye socket, on the postorbital another, smaller, horn is present. The frontal bones do not contribute to the crest; they are unique among Theropoda in having a combined rectangular instead of triangular shape, due to the posterior position of the crest rear. Profile view of skull cast The praemaxilla has a narrow ascending branch, forming the front of the crest. The rear of this branch is forked and embraces a lateral point of the nasal, a feature not recognised in the original description of 1994. At the base of the branch a small opening is present. A larger opening is located below the nostril. Both openings are connected by a distinct groove, curving around the underside of the nostril. The function of this unique trait is unknown. The praemaxilla bears four teeth. The maxilla bears thirteen teeth. The maxilla has a short depression around the lower front of the antorbital fenestra. Within this area a smaller hollowing is located, closed at the inside, perhaps representing the fenestra promaxillaris, of which it has the usual position, or the fenestra maxillaris, the normal identity of a single opening. In the braincase, the channel of the nervus trigeminus, the fifth brain nerve, is not bifurcated. The palatine bone is pneumatised, as shown by the presence of a pneumatopore. In the lower jaw, the external mandibular fenestra is rather small for a basal tetanuran. The holotype shows eighteen teeth in the right dentary, seventeen in the left dentary; such an asymmetry is not rare among large theropods. A row of foramina is present below and on the outer side of the tooth row. These openings are relatively large below the first four teeth; more to behind, they become smaller and their row curves downwards. From the ninth tooth onwards, the foramina merge into a groove. A second row of openings runs parallel to the lower jaw edge and ends at the thirteenth tooth position, which is exceptionally far. At the inside of the dentary, the Meckelian groove at the level of the third tooth extends to the front into two superimposed narrow slits. The rear of the lower jaw shows a unique combination of a kinked suture between the angular and the surangular, and the basal trait of the surangular reaching the rear jaw edge. The rather small foramen surangulare posterior is not overhung by a thick bone shelf, which is rare among large theropods. Size comparison The vertebral column consists of nine cervical vertebrae, fourteen dorsals and five sacrals. The number of tail vertebrae is unknown. The cervical vertebrae of the neck are strongly pneumatised. They possess pleurocoels at their sides and their insides are hollowed out by large air chambers. The neural spines of the cervical vertebrae are narrow in side view and decreased in width towards the rear: those of the eighth and ninth vertebrae were rod-like. At least the first three dorsal vertebrae of the back have pleurocoels as well. The dorsals are connected by robust hyposphene- hypantrum complexes. From the sixth vertebra onwards the neural spines abruptly become wider. The neural spines of the sacral vertebrae are not fused into a supraneural plate. The tail base is slightly oriented downwards. The caudal vertebrae of the tail base also show hyposphene-hypantrum complexes. In the pelvis, the ilium has a slightly convex upper profile. Its front blade has a pending, hook-shaped point. The edge of the base of the front blade is incised by a groove. The ilium has some basal traits. The process to which the pubic bone is attached, has two facets, one directed to below, the other obliquely pointing to the front, instead of a single facet. Also basal is the fact that the hip joint is overhung by a hood-shaped extension of the antitrochanter; the front of this hood reaches further to below and to the outer side. There is no clear brevis shelf. The pubic bones and the ischia resemble each other in having a \\"foot\\" and being per pair connected via bony skirts, pierced by a foramen. Classification Monolophosaurus was originally termed a \\"megalosaur\\" and has often since been suggested to be an allosauroid. Smith et al. (2007) was the first publication to find Monolophosaurus to be a non-neotetanuran tetanuran,Smith ND, Makovicky PJ, Hammer WR, Currie PJ. 2007.

Zoological Journal of the Linnean Society 151: 377‚Äì421. by noting many characters previously thought to be exclusive of Allosauroidea to have a more wider distribution. Also, Zhao et al. in 2010 noted various primitive features of the skeleton suggesting that Monolophosaurus could be one of the most basal tetanuran dinosaurs instead. Benson (2008, 2010) placed Monolophosaurus in a clade with Chuandongocoelurus that is more basal than Megalosauridae and Spinosauridae in the Megalosauroidea.Benson, 2008. A new theropod phylogeny focussing on basal tetanurans, and its implications for European 'megalosaurs' and Middle Jurassic dinosaur endemism. Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology. 51A. Later, Benson et al. (2010) found the Chuandongocoelurus/Monolophosaurus clade to be outside of Megalosauroidea and Neotetanurae, near the base of Tetanurae. A 2012 phylogeny found Monolophosaurus and Chuandongocoelurus, while not sister taxa, to form a group outside more derived groups at the base of Tetanurae.

Montanoceratops was a small sized, moderately-built, ground-dwelling, quadrupedal herbivore, that could grow up to an estimated long. Description Restoration Montanoceratops was a typical primitive ceratopsian in many respects, distinguished from the later species by the presence of claws, rather than hooves, and by having teeth in its upper jaw, rather than a toothless beak. It was once thought to have a horn on its nose but that was a misplaced cheek horn.Holtz, Thomas R. Jr. (2008) Dinosaurs: The Most Complete, Up-to-Date Encyclopedia for Dinosaur Lovers of All Ages Supplementary Information According to Brown and Schlaikjer (1935), Montanoceratops can be distinguished based on the following characteristics: * the nasal bone is proportionally large, deep, heavy and with a very well developed horncore * the dentary is long with a straight ventral margin Discovery and species Mounted skeleton incorrectly restored with a nasal horn The first fossil remains of what we now know as Montanoceratops were discovered on the Blackfeet Indian Reservation, west of Buffalo Lake, Montana in the St. Mary River Formation. It was collected in 1916 by Barnum Brown and Peter C. Kaisen of the American Museum of Natural History from terrestrial sediments that were deposited during the Maastrichtian stages of the Cretaceous period, approximately 70 million years ago. After having mounted a reconstruction in 1935, Brown and his assistant Erich Maren Schlaikjer named it in 1942 as a new species of Leptoceratops: Leptoceratops cerorhynchos; this is the type species of Montanoceratops. The genus name Montanoceratops, means \\"Montana horned face\\", and is derived from the state of Montana, which is the site of the discovery of the holotype specimen, and the Greek words \\"keras\\" (Œ∫ŒµœÅŒ±œÇ) meaning \\"horn\\", and \\"ops\\" (œâœà) meaning \\"face\\". The type and only valid species known today is Montanoceratops cerorhynchos. The original type material discovered by Barnum Brown, designated specimen AMNH 5464, included an incomplete skull and mandible (with most of the skull absent), a complete series of eleven cervical, twelve dorsal and eight sacral vertebrae, thirteen complete caudal vertebrae and the centra of two others, several ribs, a complete pelvic girdle except for the right pubis and the distal part of the right ischium, both femora (346mm), the left tibia (355mm), left fibula and left astragalus, the second phalanx of digit three, and the ungual phalanges of the first, third and fourth digits of the left pes (foot). This specimen is housed in the collection of the American Museum of Natural History in New York City, USA. In 1986, David B. Weishampel discovered more material referable to Montanoceratops in the Little Rocky Coulee locality of the St. Mary River Formation, in Glacier County, Montana. The material, which was found in terrestrial sediments, was also considered Maastrichtian in age. A description of this material was published in a paper by Brenda Chinnery and Weishampel in 1998. In 2001, Peter Makovicky examined and described specimen AMNH 5244, an incomplete but well-preserved braincase that he assigned to Montanoceratops. This specimen was collected by Barnum Brown in 1910, from terrestrial sediments on the east bank of the Red Deer River near Tolman Ferry at the Horseshoe Canyon Formation in Alberta, Canada.P. J. Makovicky. 2001. A Montanoceratops cerorhynchus (Dinosauria: Ceratopsia) braincase from the Horseshoe Canyon Formation of Alberta. Mesozoic Vertebrate Life, D. H. Tanke and K. Carpenter (eds.), Indiana University Press, Bloomington 243-262 This specimen is also housed in the collection of the American Museum of Natural History. Classification Juvenile specimen from Montana In 1942, Brown assigned the type material AMNH 5464 to the genus Leptoceratops which he concluded was a member of the taxon \\"protoceratopsidae\\". In 1951, Charles Mortram Sternberg examined more material belonging to Leptoceratops which showed that AMNH 5464 was a distinct genus, and hence he reassigned it to a new genus Montanoceratops.C. M. Sternberg. 1951. Complete skeleton of Leptoceratops gracilis Brown from the Upper Edmonton Member on Red Deer River, Alberta. National Museum of Canada Bulletin 123:225-255 In 1996, Chinnery and Weishampel conducted a phylogenetic analysis of basal neoceratopsians which showed that the \\"protoceratopsidae\\" was a polyphyletic group (i.e. not a valid taxon) and designated Montanoceratops as the most advanced basal neoceratopsian. In 2001, Mackovicky, concluded that Montanoceratops belonged to the taxon Leptoceratopsidae, and defined this group as consisting of Leptoceratops gracilis and all species closer to Leptoceratops than to Triceratops horridus. A study by Ryan et al. (2012) confirmed this assignment. The following cladogram is based on a 2015 analysis by Yiming He, Peter J. Makovicky, Kebai Wang, Shuqing Chen, Corwin Sullivan, Fenglu Han, Xing XuMichael J. Ryan, David C. Evans, Philip J. Currie, Caleb M. Brown and Don Brinkman. Paleobiology Foot bones Another unusual feature was the presence of tall spines on the bones of the tail. Although these would not have been visible during life, they would have made the tail unusually deep in cross-section. Since the tail was also highly flexible, it is possible that it was used in intra-species signalling, and that the deep shape made it more visible. Montanoceratops, like all Ceratopsians, was a herbivore. It would have used its sharp Ceratopsian beak to bite off the leaves or needles. Paleopathology In specimen AMNH 5464, the neural spines of several of the caudal vertebrae show an ankylosis that is a result of a severe injury sustained by this individual during its lifetime. Evidence of this injury is also present in the outer surface of the left ischium, where there is a large, irregularly shaped growth of bone that has formed across a healed fracture. Paleoecology=Habitat The St. Mary River Formation has not undergone a definitive radiometric dating, however, the available stratigraphic correlation has shown that this formation was laid down between 74 and 66 million years ago during the final regression of the mid-continental Bearpaw Seaway. It ranges from as far south as Glacier County, Montana to as far north as the Little Bow River in Alberta. The St. Mary River Formation is part of the Western Canadian Sedimentary Basin in southwestern Alberta, which extends from the Rocky Mountains in the west to the Canadian Shield in the east. It is laterally equivalent to the Horseshoe Canyon Formation. The region where dinosaurs lived was bounded by mountains to the west, and included ancient channels, small freshwater ponds, streams, and floodplains. The Horseshoe Canyon Formation has been radiometrically dated as being between 74 and 67 million years old. It was deposited during the gradual withdrawal of the Western Interior Seaway, during the Campanian and Maastrichtian stage of the Late Cretaceous period. The Horseshoe Canyon Formation is a terrestrial unit which is part of the Edmonton Group that includes the Battle Formation and the Whitemud Member, both in Edmonton. The valley where dinosaurs lived included ancient meandering estuary channels, straight channels, peat swamps, river deltas, floodplains, shorelines and wetlands. Due to the changing sea levels, many different environments are represented in the Horseshoe Canyon Formation, including offshore and near-shore marine habitats and coastal habitats like lagoons, and tidal flats. The area was wet and warm with a temperate to subtropical climate. Just prior to the Campanian‚ÄìMaastrichtian boundary, the mean annual temperature and precipitation in this region dropped rapidly. The dinosaurs from this formation form part of the Edmontonian land vertebrate age, and are distinct from those in the formations above and below. Paleofauna Montanoceratops shared the paleoenvironment of the St. Mary River Formation with other dinosaurs, such as the ceratopsians Anchiceratops and Pachyrhinosaurus canadensis, the armored nodosaur Edmontonia longiceps, the duckbilled hadrosaur Edmontosaurus regalis, the theropods Hagryphus, Saurornitholestes and Troodon, and the tyrannosaurid Albertosaurus which was likely the apex predator in its ecosystem.\\"Alberta, Canada; 13. St. Mary River Formation,\\" in Weishampel, et al. (2004). Pages 577-578. Vertebrates present in the St. Mary River Formation at the time of Montanoceratops included the actinopterygian fishes Amia fragosa, Lepisosteus, Belonostomus longirostris, Paralbula casei, and Platacodon nanus, the mosasaur Plioplatecarpus, and the diapsid reptile Champsosaurus. A fair number of mammals lived in this region, which included Turgidodon russelli, Cimolestes, Didelphodon, Leptalestes, Cimolodon nitidus, and Paracimexomys propriscus. Non-vertebrates in this ecosystem included mollusks, the oyster Crassostrea wyomingensis, the small clam Anomia, and the snail Melania.Kososki, B., Reiser, H., Cavitt, C., Detterman, R (1978) A Gravity study of the northern part of the Arctic National Wildlife Range, Alaska. (Geological Survey Bulletin 1440) Bibliography: p. 20-21 Plants found include the aquatic angiosperm Trapago angulata, the amphibious heterosporous fern Hydropteris pinnata, rhizomes, and taxodiaceous conifers. The paleofauna of the Horseshoe Canyon Formation featured a number of vertebrates that lived at the same time as Montanoceratops. This included dinosaurs such as the ankylosaurids Anodontosaurus lambei, Edmontonia longiceps, Euoplocephalus tutus, the maniraptorans Atrociraptor marshalli, Epichirostenotes curriei, Richardoestesia gilmorei, Richardoestesia isosceles, the troodontid Paronychodon lacustris and an unnamed species of Troodon, the alvarezsaurid theropod Albertonykus borealis, the ornithomimids Dromiceiomimus brevitertius, Ornithomimus edmontonicus, and an unnamed species of Struthiomimus, the bone- head pachycephalosaurid Stegoceras, and Sphaerotholus edmontonensis, the ornithopod Parksosaurus warreni, the hadrosaurids Edmontosaurus regalis, Hypacrosaurus altispinus, and Saurolophus osborni, the ceratopsians Anchiceratops ornatus, Arrhinoceratops brachyops, Eotriceratops xerinsularis, Pachyrhinosaurus canadensis and Pachyrhinosaurus lakustai, the primitive tyrannosauroid Dryptosaurus, and the tyrannosaurids Albertosaurus and Daspletosaurus, which were the apex predators of this paleoenvironment. Of these, the hadrosaurs dominated in terms of sheer number and made up half of all dinosaurs who lived in this region. Vertebrates present in the Horseshoe Canyon Formation at the time of Montanoceratops included reptiles, and amphibians. Sharks, rays, sturgeons, bowfins, gars and the gar-like Aspidorhynchus made up the fish fauna. Reptiles such as turtles and crocodilians are rare in the Horseshoe Canyon Formation, and this was thought to reflect the relatively cool climate which prevailed at the time. A study by Quinney et al. (2013) however, showed that the decline in turtle diversity, which was previously attributed to climate, coincided instead with changes in soil drainage conditions, and was limited by aridity, landscape instability, and migratory barriers.Arbour, Victoria (2010). \\"A Cretaceous armoury: Multiple ankylosaurid taxa in the Late Cretaceous of Alberta, Canada and Montana, USA\\". Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology 30 (Supplement 2): 55A. The saltwater plesiosaur Leurospondylus was present and freshwater environments were populated by turtles, Champsosaurus, and crocodilians like Leidyosuchus and Stangerochampsa. Evidence has shown that multituberculates and the early marsupial Didelphodon coyi were present. Vertebrate trace fossils from this region included the tracks of theropods, ceratopsians and ornithopods, which provide evidence that these animals were also present.Weishampel, David B.; Dodson, Peter; and Osm√≥lska, Halszka (eds.): The Dinosauria, 2nd, Berkeley: University of California Press. (2004) 861 pp. . Non-vertebrates in this ecosystem included both marine and terrestrial invertebrates.

The club are currently members of the and play at Southchurch Park. History Southend Manor was formed in 1955 by Gil and Doris Medcalf in Southend-on-Sea as a team of 10 and 11-year-old boys. Gil Medcalf had played for Eton Manor both before and after the Second World War, and the inclusion of manor in our club name is a direct echoing of Gil's own career. The team was accepted into the lowest division of the Southend Youth League in 1959 and promptly finished last. Steady improvement was made in the Youth League and when the team became too old for youth football, in 1964, Southend Manor entered Division 5 of the Southend Borough Combination. The rest of the 1960s saw a steady advance up the divisions with the Premier Division being reached in 1969. The 1970s and early 1980s saw a domination of the Borough Combination. In twelve seasons Southend Manor were league champions six times and runners up three times. The league's knock-out cup was won five times and they were once runners up. In particular, the 1978‚Äì79 season saw a closing run of 25 wins and one draw in the last 26 games which included the capture of the Essex Intermediate Cup. With both League and League Cup won, an exhausting season ended with the winning of the Southend Charity Competition. In the early 1980s entry was gained to the newly formed Southend & District Alliance and two titles were gained in the first three years. With such a good pedigree it must be wondered why Southend Manor were unable to progress to higher standards of football. The problem was that the club used council pitches that were only available for a limited part of the season. However, after many years of pressure Southend Manor was allowed to use Southchurch Park (originally sharing with Southend Athletic Club) which had many of the attributes needed for Senior Football. In 1985 the club gained access to the Essex Senior League Reserve Division, while carrying out the work needed to meet senior status requirements. This status was reached in 1988 with a new clubhouse being erected. In the second season the Essex Senior League Cup was won. In season 1990‚Äì91 the Essex Senior League title was won along with the Harry Fisher Memorial Cup, while the League Cup saw us fall in the final. In 1991‚Äì92 the final of the Harry Fisher Memorial Cup was reached but the Club was narrowly defeated by a goal in the last minute of extra time. In 1992‚Äì93 Southend Manor won the prestigious Essex Senior Trophy, and in 1995‚Äì96 they reached the final of the League Cup once more but were beaten by double winners Romford. In 1996‚Äì97 the club reached the last 32 of the FA Vase and in May of the same year reached the final of the Anglia TV 5-a-side Tournament held at Norwich. The 2001‚Äì02 season saw the Club win the League Cup against Sawbridgeworth and the Charity Shield against League Winners Brentwood. The Eastern Floodlit Cup was won in the season 2002‚Äì03. In the 2006‚Äì07 season Southend Manor Under 16s Eastern Junior Alliance Side were the first team in the club's history to win the league at this level, and also go through the entire league campaign unbeaten. They came up against good opposition with the likes of Grays Athletic F.C, Burnham Ramblers F.C and Bowers and Pitsea F.C. The Mini and Junior Sections of the Club, having been introduced in season 1999‚Äì2000, are thriving and the Club now fields 17 teams from Under 7 to the First Team. Full F.A. Charter status was awarded to the Youth Section in August 2004, new state of the art floodlights were installed in the same month and, subject to the usual budget considerations, and compliance with ground grading requirements, The Manor will continue to consolidate its position at this level of non-league football. The period from 2007‚Äì11 saw positive improvements for the club both on and off the pitch. During the summer of 2007, a new all Seated 'Main' stand was erected replacing the ageing Athletics stand. A further covered terraced stand was erected during the summer of 2009 to complement the main stand at the Arena. On the pitch, the first team continued to boast positive campaigns with several semi-final berths and regular progression within the national FA Vase and FA Cup competitions. A fifth-placed finish in the 2010‚Äì11 Essex Senior League confirmed a fourth consecutive top six finish for the club. The club reached the 4th qualifying round of the 2011-12 FA Cup, the first time the team has done so in its history, and the first time an Essex Senior League side has done since 1993.Southend Manor chairman eyes FA Cup upset BBC Sport 18 October 2011 The club gave Conference giants Kettering Town a scare in a brave 3‚Äì1 loss when the sides entered half time at 1‚Äì1 in front of a crowd of 989.

In January 2016, Stuart Marshall and Jack Tebbutt were appointed as First Team Manager & First Team Assistant Manager respectively. In October 2018, Michael Walther was removed from his position as First Team Manager with Craig Waters taking over in his place.

Nemegtosaurus was named after the Nemegt Basin in the Gobi Desert, where the remains ‚Äî a single skull ‚Äî were found. The skull resembles diplodocoids in being long and low, with pencil- shaped teeth. However, recent work has shown that Nemegtosaurus is in fact a titanosaur, closely related to animals such as Saltasaurus, Alamosaurus and Rapetosaurus. Discovery and taxonomy Vertebrae that may belong to Nemegtosaurus The skull of Nemegtosaurus comes from the same beds as the titanosaur Opisthocoelicaudia, which is known from a skeleton lacking the neck and skull. Originally, the referral of Nemegtosaurus to Diplodocoidea and Opisthocoelicaudia to Camarasauridae argued that the two represented different species. Both of these genera represent advanced titanosaurians, however, raising the possibility that the two are in fact the same animal. Relocation of the Nemegtosaurus type locality in Central Sayr and discovery of postcrania comparable to those Opisthocoelicauda holotype at the Nemegtosaurus holotype locality has discussed the possibility that Opisthocoelicauda is a junior synonym. Consequently, Opisthocoelicaudiinae would be a junior synonym of Nemegtosauridae. The type species, Nemegtosaurus mongoliensis, was first described by Nowinski in 1971 on the basis of ZPAL MgD-I/9. A second species, N. pachi, was described by Dong in 1977 on the basis of the teeth IVPP V.4879, but is a nomen dubium. In 2019, Alexander O. Averianov and Alexey V. Lopatin reported Nemegt sauropod vertebrae discovered in 1949 and some femora that differed from the same bones of Opisthocoelicaudia, and stated they probably belonged to Nemegtosaurus, thereby supporting that the two genera were distinct. Description restoration Like other titanosaurs, the teeth are slender pencil-like structures that are ground down at a sharp angle to produce a chisel-like tip. The diet of Nemegtosaurus is unknown, however. There are no plant fossils from the Gobi, but during the Late Cretaceous, flowering plants became increasingly diverse, although in many environments ferns and conifers were still more common. Neither is it clear whether Nemegtosaurus browsed high in the trees or grazed on low-growing plants; related titanosaurs include both long-necked browsing forms like Rapetosaurus and short-necked forms like Bonitasaura. Comparisons between the scleral rings of Nemegtosaurus and modern birds and reptiles suggest that it may have been cathemeral, active throughout the day at short intervals. Paleoenvironment Restoration of the head Nemegtosaurus is found in the Maastrichtian aged (66-72 Ma) Nemegt Formation, which makes it one of the last sauropods on earth. There, on a lush river delta flowing through the ancient sands of the Gobi Desert, Nemegtosaurus would have coexisted with animals like the ornithomimid Gallimimus, the alvarezsaurid Mononykus, the velociraptorine Adasaurus, and the giant, saber-clawed therizinosaur Therizinosaurus. It also lived alongside the tyrannosaur Tarbosaurus. Its size (estimated at roughly 40 feet long) may have offered an adult some protection against Tarbosaurus, but juveniles would have been vulnerable. References * Nowinski, A. (1971).

Its start is timed to coordinate with the harvest period, so local communities determine when that will be. It begins in the easternmost part of Ahanta and advances southwestward together with the harvest period. Ritual drumming, singing and dancing take place for four weeks, and are considered the way the community expels devils and protects its good fortune.

This is not a conventional esplanade in the sense that the place is not exactly situated alongside a waterbody. However, the Ganga river (Ganges), also known as Hooghly river, flows nearby. History The Esplanade was the name given to the northern portion of jungle, which later formed the Maidan. In olden days, it stretched from Dhurmotollah (now Lenin Sarani) to Chandpal Ghat on the Hooghly river. In the days of Warren Hastings, it formed a favourite promenade for 'elegant walking parties'. The first pictures of the area is at the end of eighteenth century by Daniell and William Baillie. The old Government House and the Council House were conspicuous objects in each drawing. He also presented an addition view in the shape of two elephants with a crowd of attendants.Cotton, H.E.A., Calcutta Old and New, 1909/1980, p 254-261, General Printers and Publishers Pvt. Ltd. Bourne & Shepherd, photographic studio was established here in 1867 by British photographers, Samuel Bourne and Charles Shepherd. The strengthening of British power, subsequent to their victory in the Battle of Plassey was followed by the construction of the new Fort William, in 1758. The European inhabitants of Kalikata gradually forsook the narrow limits of the old palisades and moved to around the Maidan.Cotton, H.E.A., p. 72. The first recorded soccer match in Kolkata was played on the Esplanade in the second week of April 1858 between the Calcutta Club of Civilians and the 'Gentlemen of Barrakpur'. There had been matches earlier but those were not documented.Nandy, Moti, Calcutta Soccer, p. 316, in Calcutta, the Living City, Vol II, edited by Sukanta Chaudhuri, 1990/2005, p.2, Oxford University Press, . The locality A number of roads and streets form part of or have been linked integrally with the Esplanade for many years. Esplanade Row The street named Esplanade Row, finds a mention in the map of 1784, running from Dhurmotollah right on to the banks of the river at Chandpal Ghat, passing on its way Government House and Council House, both facing south. Subsequently, it was divided by the gardens of Government House into two parts, Esplanade Row (East) and Esplanade Row (West). Esplanade Row (West) now runs between Government Place (West) and Strand Road, through the Kolkata High Court. Esplanade Row (East) has been renamed Sidhu Kanu Dahar and occupies the northern end of the Maidan.Map nos. 28, 29, Detail Maps of 141 Wards of Kolkata, D.R.Publication and Sales Concern, 66 College Street, Kolkata ‚Äì 700073 Esplanade Row (East) in the 19th century ‚Äì a painting by Allom, T. As a result of the movement of Europeans from the old palisades in the eighteenth century, Esplanade Row took on a new look. The most important public buildings and imposing private houses lined the northern side of the Esplanade, facing the Maidan on the south. ‚ÄúEsplanade Row,‚Äù wrote Mrs. Fay, ‚Äúseems to be composed of palaces.‚ÄùLahiri Choudhury, Dhriti Kanta, Trends in Calcutta Architecture, in Calcutta, the Living City, Vol I, pp. 156‚Äì160, edited by Sukanta Chaudhuri, Oxford University Press, . The Tipu Sultan Mosque is at the junction of Esplanade Row (East) and Dhurmotollah Street (Lenin Sarani). A number of statues adorn the area. Old Court House Street Old Court House Street connects Esplanade Row (East) (or presently Sidhu Kanu Dahar) with B.B.D. Bagh, earlier known as Dalhousie Square. It acquired its name from the Old Court house, that was located where St. Andrew's Church now stands. It served originally as the Supreme Court, until it was demolished in 1792. The northern part of the stretch is known as B.B.D. Bagh (East). It was constructed around 1781, when the finishing touches were put to the new Fort William. It is linked with the name of Col. Henry Watson, who brought about many improvements in Calcutta, including the laying out of surrounding Esplanade. The Red Road is an extension of this street. The stretch of Old Court House Street from the crossing with Ganesh Avenue or the south-eastern corner of B.B.D. Bagh to the crossing with Waterloo Street has been renamed Hemanta Basu Sarani. The stretch from the crossing with Waterloo Street to the crossing with Rani Rashmoni Avenue has been renamed Marx Engels Beethi Road.Map no. 29, Detail Maps of 141 Wards of Kolkata. Council House Street Council House Street connects the western part of B.B.D. Bagh with Esplanade Row. It acquires its name from the old council house, which stood on the western portion of Government House. It was pulled down in 1800. The southern part of the street was subsequently called Government Place West.Fort William College was located at the corner of Council House Street.Cotton, H.E.A., p. 271. Traffic hub Esplanade has always been a major traffic hub. In 1902, the first electric tram car (route no. 36) ran from Esplanade to Kidderpore. In 1984, the first underground railway (Kolkata Metro Line 1) in India, started from Tollygunge to Esplanade. Today, Esplanade is the busiest bus terminus of West Bengal. Kolkata trams route no. 5, 25 and 36 also start their journey from Esplanade.Google maps In 2002, it was estimated that during rush hours some 200,000 to 300,000 vehicles passed through Esplanade. Experts say 50‚Äì60 percent of air pollution in Kolkata is due to vehicle emission. Increase in number of vehicles may have added to the problem. In the Esplanade area, the noise levels are 75‚Äì84 dB.Chakraborti, Dipankar, Calcutta's Environment, p.185, in Calcutta, the Living City, Vol II According to transport department officials, over 2,000 long-distance buses operate from the city. Most of the state and private buses originate from the Esplanade and Babughat, nearby. Kolkata Metro Line 2 and Kolkata Metro Line 3, which are under construction, will pass through Esplanade also. Esplanade will become the biggest junction of Kolkata Metro soon. Eden Gardens railway station on Kolkata Circular Railway line is the nearest railway station. Sealdah Station, one of the five major railway-terminals of Kolkata Metropolitan Area, is also located nearby. Rallies The growing influence of the left-wing, particularly the Communist Party of India in organising urban protest was strongly felt from around 1957. The old institutions of mass mobilisation were strengthened to suit the agitation-oriented strategy of various political parties. A particularly significant expression of this agitation-oriented form of opposition to government policies was the way in which massive demonstrations of tens of thousands of people were organised in the heart of the city. Esplanade East, and Brigade Parade ground, lying just outside the citadels of power, were the new rallying points of mass protest.Chaterjee, Partha, The Political Culture of Calcutta, p. 30, in Calcutta, the Living City, Vol II  Gallery  File:Esplanade-Mansion-side-view- Kolkata.jpgEsplanade Mansion File:Esplanade Bus Station.jpgEsplanade Bus Station with Shaheed Minar in the background File:Songrokkhon.JPGTram Museum (Smaranika) in Esplanade Tram Terminus File:Kolkata Military Secretariat.jpgOrdnance Factory Board's Office http://dgaeroqa.gov.in/rd- kolkata.htm File:Victoria House - Esplanade - Kolkata 2011-09-11 00541.jpgVictoria House File:Metropolitan Building - Esplanade - Kolkata 2012-09-19 0013.jpgMetropolitan Building File:Metro Cinema - Esplanade - Kolkata 2011-12-18 0024.JPGMetro Cinema File:Kolkata Tipu Sultan's Mosque3.jpgTipu Sultan Mosque See also *Metropolitan Building ReferencesExternal links * Category:Tourist attractions in Kolkata Category:Neighbourhoods in Kolkata ","title":"Esplanade, Kolkata"},{"id":"3548820","text":"Breda machine gun can refer one of several weapons made by the Italian Breda company: *Breda-SAFAT machine gun - used in aircraft *Breda 38 - used in vehicles *Breda 30 - light machine gun *Breda M37 - heavy machine gun ","title":"Breda machine gun"},{"id":"3548821","text":"Najlepsze z najgorszych (Polish for the best of the worst) is a compilation vinyl longplay released by Polish punk rock band The Analogs specially for the band's 10th anniversary.

Its fossils were found in the Smoky Hill Chalk Member of the Niobrara Formation, in western Kansas, which would have been near the middle of Western Interior Sea during the Late Cretaceous. It was a nodosaurid, an ankylosaur without a clubbed tail. It was closely related to Nodosaurus. The type species, Niobrarasaurus coleii, was discovered and collected in 1930 by a geologist named Virgil Cole. It was originally described by Mehl in 1936 and named Hierosaurus coleii. It was then re-described as a new genus by Carpenter et al. in 1995. In 2002 the type specimen was transferred to the Sternberg Museum of Natural History, Hays, Kansas. It's been estimated to be 5 meters (16 feet) in length and around 227-453 kg (500-1.000 lbs) according to Thomas Holtz. Paul gave a higher estimation of 6.5 meters (21.3 ft) and 4 tonnes (8.800 lbs).

His amateur musical activities included Baroque chamber music, and the combination of his vocation and avocation soon led to an interest in harpsichords. He built his first instrument in 1955. As a builder, Zuckermann was self-taught. He describes how he sought information: \\"Dropping in on Frank Hubbard in Boston (one of three American harpsichord makers) as a complete stranger, I was given a guided tour of his workshop on a Sunday morning after getting him out of bed. (I must say, he is as close to a saint as I've ever met.) The Metropolitan Museum opened its basement for me, and other collections were kind and cooperative.\\" With this informal background Zuckermann succeeded in building his first harpsichord, which was rather similar in form to the kit instrument he started selling a number of years later.Zuckermann (1968). In 1958 the New York Times printed a picture of Zuckermann working in his shop at 55 Clarkson Street with cabinetmaker Jules Antonsen; the instrument they are working on has the characteristic \\"straight bentside\\" of the later kit instrument. See Edith Evans-Asbury, \\"Ex-psychologist and cabinetmaker spur harpsichord revival in the 'village', New York Times, 10 Sept. 1958, p. 67. The time was propitious for a new maker. Musical tastes were evolving,Zuckermann told a reporter in 1958, \\"It is part of the basic affinity between the twentieth century -- the Age of Science -- and the eighteenth century, which was the Age of Reason. We feel closer to that century than to the one in between, which was too romantic for our taste.\\" From \\"Ex-psychologist and cabinetmaker spur harpsichord revival in the 'village', New York Times, 10 Sept. 1958, p. 67. with a revived interest in Baroque music and historically informed performance. The newly- perfected long playing record made possible the widespread distribution of high-quality recordings of Baroque works. Moreover, there were very few makers producing harpsichords in America. Thus Zuckermann found that there was high demand for his instruments and he soon had established a new business as a harpsichord builder. By 1960, he had sold \\"seventy or eighty instruments\\".Kottick (2003:459) By this point, Zuckermann had become frustrated by the amount of time he spent on service calls, and became concerned that maintenance would soon consume all of his available time. He conceived the idea that if his customers were to build their instruments themselves from a kit, they would then be self-sufficient with regard to maintenance. He first tested the idea on friends: > I gave a few of my friends all the raw parts necessary to make a harpsichord > and some rudimentary directions. These were people who wanted an instrument > but couldn't afford one, and they seized on this chance. Even the less > mechanical ones were thrilled with the prospect and their sheer will to > possess such an instrument made them better craftsmen than experienced > cabinet makers. Implemented commercially in 1960, the kit idea proved an extraordinary success; the \\"do-it-yourself\\" harpsichord kit, sometimes called the 'Model T' harpsichord, was sold in large quantities (over 10,000 by 1969) to institutions, professionals, and individuals around the world. Harpsichord scholar Edward Kottick writes, \\"Wolfgang Zuckermann never intended to become a phenomenon; he only hoped to satisfy a demand for harpsichords he himself could not accommodate. Nevertheless, his harpsichord kit spawned a unique movement whose heyday lasted for twenty years and helped fuel the instrument's revival. Some of today's finest builders got their start with a Zuckermann slantside kit.\\"Kottick (2003:460) Initially the wooden pieces for the case, along with some other commonly available parts, were not included, so the price was set at a most economical $150. Little by little, the Zuckermann kit became more elaborate and complete. By the mid 1960s unassembled cases consisting of carefully cut unfinished wood of various kinds could be purchased optionally. Other instrument kits were also made available, including a spinet harpsichord (1966) and a clavichord. Production The headquarters for kit production was Zuckermann's New York workshop on Christopher Street in Greenwich Village; for a time this continued to produce completed instruments, though eventually the burden of making enough kits to fill demand led Zuckermann to abandon this part of the business.The Modern Harpsichord, p. 210 The evolved production system included some work in the shop itself, but with substantial outsourcing to larger enterprises.Outsourcing appears to have been a response to a crisis in the evolution of the firm. In 1962, HiFi/Stereo Review reported that Zuckermann was producing 260 kits per year and having trouble meeting demand. It also described him as yearning for more free time for his personal interests (e.g. chamber music) and unwilling to expand his business any further. HiFi/Stereo Review, November 1962, pp. 48-49; . Operations at the shop are described in a memoir by the poet Eleanor Lerman, who was hired in 1970 at age 18 to work on the production line. The description slightly postdates Zuckermann's departure from the company; \\"Michael\\" is Michael Zuckermann, Wolfgang's younger brother. > At the time, Zuckermann Harpsichords ... was housed in the first floor of a > small, quirky 19th century building on Charles Street.

Lerman's > experience in the shop is remembered affectionately in several of her works; > see Eleanor Lerman. Zuckermann himself observed (in his book The Modern Harpsichord) that the workforce in harpsichord shops of the time tended to consist of nontraditional workers.The Modern Harpsichord, p. 131: \\"an assortment of college drop-outs, Sicilian cabinet makers, semi-hippies, harpsichord \\"nuts\\" and deaf-mutes\\". Among the outsourced items, the most important was the parts for the case, which had to be precision-cut, mitered, and (for the outer case), veneered. Zuckermann enlisted capable help from nearby: > Through a friend I was introduced to a giant woodworking plant [in > Philadelphia], covering several city blocks, with automatic-feed circular > saws, gang drills (14 drill presses coming down automatically at the same > time) and gang combinations of automatic saws and drills which can cut a > piece to size, miter it and drill it on several sides, all in one operation. > ...

Zuckermann made it possible for kit builders to provide dark naturals and white sharps by selling (as an option) blank keyboards, to which the builder would glue appropriate coverings.Source for this paragraph: The Modern Harpsichord pp. 205-206 The plywood for the soundboard, a key element of the instrument, was special-ordered; the boards were made of \\"3-ply basswood, 1/8 in. thick, which is not commercially available but had to be made up specially in a New England plant. A minimum of 300 sheets (each making two boards) had to be ordered at one time.\\"The Modern Harpsichord, p. 204 The customer base Zuckermann's kit harpsichord became one of the most popular harpsichord models ever; it was assembled by people of all agesZuckermann reported an age range of 12 to 80; The Modern Harpsichord p. 207. and given affectionate nicknames such the \\"Slantside\\" or the \\"Z-box\\". America in the 1960s was perhaps ripe for the success of a harpsichord kit. Americans of the day had essentially no computers or other digital equipment with which to spend their free time, and recreational activity involving the assembly of things was widespread.Kottick (2003:463) writes, \\"There is little doubt that the 5' slant-side kit was able to capture the interest of what was then known as the \\"do-it-yourself\\" movement that swept through the Western world in the 1960s and 1970s.\\" See Do it yourself. Zuckermann himself was a passionate advocate of \\"do-it-yourself\\" as a means of restoring a healthy normalcy to modern lives \\"wilted\\" by the spread of job specialization and nontangible work product; see Wallace Zuckermann (1968) \\"The Do-It-Yourself Phenomenon\\", Harpsichord 1.2 (May‚ÄìJuly), p. 2. Thus in 1966 a newspaper reporter introduced the idea of a harpsichord kit to his readers thus: \\"A nation raised on homemade kites and model airplane kits is discovering that it hasn't conquered the last frontier with do-it-yourself hi- fi components. Today, thanks to a slight, graying tinkerer in New York's Greenwich Village, you can be the first on your block to build your own harpsichord.\\"Smith, Dave (1966) Harpsichord kits find makers in Viet Nam. Daytona Beach Sunday News-Journal, 23 October 1966, p. 7C. Zuckermann kept track of his more unusual customers, writing later in The Modern Harpsichord: > Once a 300-pound truck driver walked into the shop, sat down, rattled off a > Bach invention, and pulled out the cash to buy a kit, all in dollar bills. A > 13-year-old boy appeared with the contents of a piggy bank ... A prison > warden once wrote us that a convict had made a harpsichord while serving > time for murder. More systematically, he found that his buyers were typically rather educated; advertising was more effective in magazines that targeted this audience, such as Saturday Review or The New Yorker. Inhabitants of small college towns, and academics in particular, were overrepresented among purchasers.Zuckermann (1969), The Modern Harpsichord Kottick reports that some builders were unable to stop at one; they \\"built kit after kit, often selling them cheaply or even giving them away.\\"Kottick (2003:464) The Zuckermann kits were poignantly present during the wars then taking place in Southeast Asia. The reporter quoted above went on to say, \\"Zuckermann reports a large clientele in foreign countries, the armed forces, and the Peace Corps, where instruments may be scarce or a complicated project is effective antidote to loneliness, boredom, or combat fatigue. One Navy officer has his clavichord with him on an aircraft carrier. Zuckermann reports he recently sent kits to three soldiers in Viet Nam and three complete harpsichords now grace the U.S. Embassy in Phnom Penh, Cambodia, where one customer wrote of tuning [an instrument] to the accompaniment of gunfire.\\" The Z-box as instrument The Zuckermann kit harpsichord was designed to maximize affordability, and therefore involved considerable outsourcing of parts to manufacturers who could create them with the cost advantage derived from mass production. The harpsichord was also designed to be assembled by amateurs, which was one factor in using (initially) a straight piece where most harpsichords employ a curved bentside. Kottick describes and assesses the Z-box thus: > The outer case of 1/2\\" cabinet wood was glued to an inner case of 3/4\\" > plywood, making a heavily framed case capable of taking a great deal of > punishment, to say the least. ...

For technical background to > Kottick's remarks, consult Harpsichord. By \\"revival instrument\\", Kottick refers to the elaborate, multichoired, ahistorical instruments that at the time were being turned out by the thousands by factories primarily in Germany. There were a number of ways in which the original Zuckermann instrument was very much historically \\"inauthentic\\". Kottick mentions the \\"straightside\\", the extremely thick case walls, the use of plywood in the inner case, and the use of plastic for jacks. In addition, the soundboard was plywood as well; the keyboard was of heavy piano-type construction; the jacks rested on adjustable endpins rather than directly on the keys; the plectra could be moved toward or away from the string by an adjustment screw; and the strings were made of modern instrument wire rather than the softer wire of historical times. It was also unusual for a historical harpsichord the size of a Z-box to have just one choir of strings. All of these constructional factors came to be increasingly avoided by builders (including the firm Zuckermann founded) as the field of harpsichord making moved toward a historicist approach; see Kottick (2003:ch. 19) and History of the harpsichord. The Modern Harpsichord Cover of The Modern Harpsichord Around 1967, Zuckermann began a period of travel, visiting harpsichord workshops in both the United States and Europe.Letter sent ca. 1969 to Zuckermann customers by David Jacques Way, Zuckermann's successor as head of the firm He described his research findings in his 1969 book The Modern Harpsichord, a wide-ranging survey of the harpsichord makers of the time, covering their philosophies and instrument designs. Zuckermann also relied on his experience as a harpsichord technician who had worked on a wide variety of instruments. The main theme of the book was a forceful advocacy of historical principles in harpsichord construction; that is, in favor of work that attempted to recreate instruments of the kind built by the great makers of the past using lightweight construction and preindustrial materials. Zuckermann judged that the long experience of the builders of the 16th through 18th centuries had already discovered the most reliable ways to create robust and beautiful tone; and that the innovations of most 20th century builders, based mainly on the technology of the piano, had yielded feeble-toned instruments that were difficult to maintain in good playing condition. Zuckermann's preference for historical principles was especially evident in the book's warmly appreciative account of the work of three builders, Frank Hubbard, William Dowd, and Martin Skowroneck, who are acknowledged today as the key figures in the move toward historically-based harpsichord construction.See, for instance, the discussion in Kottick (2003) and the articles in this encyclopedia discussing these builders. It is also seen in Zuckermann's outright mockery of the major firms of the time who were building the heavily designed ahistorical instruments. For instance, of the Sabathil firm, he wrote (pp. 172‚Äì4): > Sabathil [has] brought [the] tradition of the German production harpsichord > to its highest pinnacle of non-achievement. [Of their instruments ], the > greatest of them all is the Bach III, a full 10' long, which I had the > privilege of seeing not long ago. This enormous creature, crouching against > an entire living room wall, has perhaps something endearing about it. ... It > has been compared to a stegosaurus, the giant extinct animal with plated > back. However, whatever charm it may have had was not sufficient to prevent > its owner from ordering a new harpsichord from a Boston makerBoston was the > center of the new historicist movement in the United States; both Dowd and > Hubbard's workshops were located there. with the intention of selling his > present one. ... The tone issuing from the giant Bach III comes out > predictably not with a bang but a whimper. A heavy-framed mid-century harpsichord by the Sperrhake firm, sharply criticized in Zuckermann's book A characteristic example of a modern harpsichord built on historical principles, built by Jean-Paul Rouaud based on a 1707 harpsichord by Nicolas Dumont. He characterized an instrument from the Neupert firm thus: it \\"suffers from laryngitis, possessing a coarse, whispering tone.\\"The Modern Harpsichord, p. 154 Zuckermann also attacked the German production harpsichord on grounds of its visual esthetics, characterizing it as tubby and ugly; he further asserted that the historical builders virtually always created instruments of grace and beauty.For the asserted ugliness of the German production harpsichord, see The Modern Harpsichord p. 74, and for the characteristic beauty of historical instruments p. 211. Kottick (1987) described the effect of The Modern Harpsichord: \\"[it] landed on the harpsichord world like bombshell, clearly showing, on page after page, the superiority of those instruments constructed on classical principles over the revival [i.e., then-mainstream] harpsichords, with all their \\"improvements\\".Kottick, Edward (1987) The Harpsichord Owner's Guide. Chapel Hill: University of North Carolina Press. According to harpsichord builder Carey Beebe, the book actually \\"altered the course of modern harpsichord development.\\"From Beebe's website, at . Carey's view is not universally shared; the views of skeptics can be seen, for instance, in contributions to the HPSCHR-L listserve, at . Certainly The Modern Harpsichord itself describes a shift well in progress, including descriptions of multiple builders already engaged in the creation of historically-oriented instruments. The conflict between the two approaches of building was indeed a live one at the time Zuckermann wrote his book, but is no longer; authentically-oriented harpsichords completely dominate the field today. The book undoubtedly upset the attacked parties very much; Zuckermann's friend David Jacques Way reported that several German makers threatened lawsuits, and the book was eventually banned in Germany.Way, David Jacques (1976) \\"Authenticity,\\" essay published as an advertisement in Early Music, Vol 4 No. 3, p. 302. On line at . The book suggests that its author valued rationality in harpsichord building and was seldom swayed by the more romantic aspects of the craft. For instance, Zuckermann suggested that machine tools properly used will always cut and drill more accurately than can be done by hand, and argued that any sort of beneficial \\"sensitivity\\" to the material claimed by the craftsman using hand tools will carry over to the craftsman using machine tools if she gets sufficient practice.See The Modern Harpsichord, pp. 51-52. He offers a diffident defense of plywood in harpsichords, suggesting it should not be dismissed out of hand and that careful comparisons of cases where plywood and solid parts have been interchanged in the same instrument are worth doing and (as of 1969) inconclusive.See The Modern Harpsichord, pp. 58-59. Zuckermann's view in this case has lost out; all serious builders today use solid word; see John Koster, \\"Wood\\", in Igor Kipnis (2006, ed.) The Harpsichord and Clavichord: An Encyclopedia). Through accident of alphabetical order, the last harpsichord builder discussed in Zuckermann's book is his own company. He mentions the essential ways in which his kit harpsichords were historically \\"authentic\\" (i.e. in having thin soundboards with light barring that avoids overlap with the bridge) and he confronts with candor the ways the ways in which his instruments were most certainly not \\"authentic\\" (for these, see discussion above). Zuckermann also defends some aspects of inauthenticity as the necessary consequence of their being designed to be affordable and constructible by amateurs. Exit from the harpsichord business The experience of researching authenticist instruments for The Modern Harpsichord evidently had a drastic effect on Zuckermann's own career as a builder. Kottick writes, \\"As a result of his experience in writing the book and the introspection it engendered, Zuckermann decided to stop producing his less- than-ideal instrument and sold his kit business [1970] to David Way.\\"Kottick (2003:522). For date of sale see Terri Byrne-Dodge, \\"A harpsichord revival in Stonington,\\" New York Times, 6 Jun. 1980. Stonington is the town in Connecticut to which Way moved the firm. Way had been the publisher of The Modern Harpsichord and become an enthusiast for harpsichord building in the process. Way shifted the firm's productions in the direction of more historically authentic instruments, making use of Zuckermann's research. The company continued to flourishIn 1980 Way reported kit sales of 4,000 per year; Byrne-Dodge. and is still in business today.http://zhi.net/ ‚Äì Zuckermann Harpsichords Although his subsequent career moved in different directions, Zuckermann remained part of the harpsichord world for some time. Living in England (see below) he designed instrument kits on historical lines in collaboration with builder Michael Thomas:See comments by Carey Beebe at . a harpsichord in Italian styleSee images at . and a clavichord.Image and description at . He also wrote for several years a quarterly column for the periodical Harpsichord, and served a consultant to other makers. According to Schott (1986) Zuckermann's involvement ended completely by the late 1970s. Sponsorship of performing arts during the harpsichord years During his time as a manufacturer of harpsichord kits, Zuckermann became involved in the performing arts. In July 1963, in collaboration with Eric Britton,http://www.ecoplan.org/library/britton-bio-note-13apr06.pdf he founded the Sundance Festival of the Chamber Arts in rural Pennsylvania; it featured classical concerts, marionette operas,For marionette operas see Anonymous, \\"Sundance arts fete to open in Bucks County July 26\\", New York Times, 3 July 1963. theater, dance, and poetry. During the later years, the festival was co- run by Zuckermann and his friend Michael Smith, who was theater critic for the Village Voice; they had met when Townsend interviewed him for his newspaper.Smith's memories of Sundance, including programs, appear at . Smith described the venue thus: > Deep in the woods in northern Bucks County, Pennsylvania, two hours west of > New York, they had built a small covered stage and a wide amphitheatre for > the audience that was open to the stars. It was extremely charming, and we > presented a wondrous range of artists over the next three summers. Farther > up the drive beyond the theatre, there were two houses, a barn, a tennis > court, a big concrete swimming [pool] down in the woods, and a screened-in > summer house. ... The performers often came for the weekend and enjoyed the > facilities. The amphitheater was designed by Zuckermann himself, seated 425, and included \\"a canvas roof for rainy weather.\\"Anonymous, \\"Sundance arts fete to open in Bucks County July 26\\", New York Times, 3 July 1963. Not surprisingly, the performers included eminent harpsichordists: Paul Jacobs, Ralph Kirkpatrick, and Fernando Valenti. Later, Zuckermann and Smith launched a further arts collaboration as sponsors of Caffe Cino, a coffee house cum off-off-Broadway theater located near his harpsichord workshop on Christopher Street. The theater's repertoire included edgy productions presenting aspects of gay life (both theater and workshop were very near the Stonewall Inn, site of the Stonewall riots of 1969, a historical landmark in history of the gay rights movement). The theater had fallen on hard times following the 1967 suicide of its founder, Joseph Cino. Smith and Zuckermann bought the theater, but quickly found it was not easy to rescue it. Cino had, it appears, been paying off the police in order to run an establishment not permitted by the zoning laws, and Smith and Zuckermann were unwilling to try to follow in his footsteps. According to Schanke and Marra, \\"authorities swooped down on the still-illegal operation. 1,250 violations quickly accumulated on the place.\\"Source for this paragraph, including quotation: Robert A. Schanke and Kim Marra (1998) Passing Performances: Queer Readings of Leading Players in American Theater History. Ann Arbor: University of Michigan Press, p. 320 The nadir of the experience for Zuckermann was a night spent in jail, as Stone relates: > [The play] Empire State features [among other characters] ... an obnoxious > boy of ten. It also features an obscenity that caused problems for the > coffeehouse. Zuckermann ... wrote ... about the event, \\"two inspectors > dressed as hippies came and watched one of our plays [Empire State] > containing what was then considered a dirty word, starting with 'mother'\\". > Because the obscenity was said in front of a child performing in the play, > Zuckermann and one of the actors who was also the boy's uncle were arrested > on January 26, 1968, only three days after the Caffe's opening. According to > the arrest record, the criminal act was to \\"permit child to act in > theratical [sic] production , acts and diolgue [sic] impair morals charge.\\" > When officials returned the child to his home, his mother's first words > were, \\"how come you're back so early?\\"Stone, Wendell C. (2005) Caffe Cino: > The birthplace of Off-Off-Broadway. Carbondale: Southern Illinois University > Press. p. 164. As Smith relates, the charge was dismissed in the morning.Smith offers further details: \\"There was a young boy in the first play, which contained some vulgar language, and one night Wolfgang was arrested as the responsible party under an obscure child labor law, although the boy's aunt brought him to the theatre every night and stayed through the play.\\" Source: . But Stone goes on to say: > In addition to ending the run of the production, the incident was deeply > upsetting to Zuckermann, who as a child had fled the Nazis with his parents. > Feeling oppressed in the United States, which seemed headed toward fascism, > Zuckermann lost his enthusiasm for operating the Cino. ... Within a year > [he] had sold his business and moved from the United States. Caffe Cino itself did not last much longer than Empire State: it closed permanently on 10 March 1968.Stone, p. 167 As activist The 1960s, when Zuckermann's harpsichord project flourished, was also the time of when the American government sent its troops to fight in a controversial war in Vietnam, leading to a sharp rise in domestic political activism. Zuckermann was an impassioned opponent of the war, who in a 1967 letter to the Village Voice described American policy as \\"mass murder\\".Letter to the Village Voice, 16 February 1967 Elsewhere he described the process of his political radicalization: \\"Like many others I was \\"radicalized\\" by three events: sitting on the steps of the Pentagon, watching the Democratic Convention on tv, and being jailed.\\"Zuckermann (1971:11). Zuckermann's jail stay is described above. He was a sponsor of Angry Arts week (25 January - 5 February 1967), an effort by the artistic community to rally opposition to the war. By 1969, Zuckermann's despair over the war had reached the point where he decided to leave the country.The reason for Zuckermann's departure is given differently by different sources. The sentence in the text originates with Zuckermann himself; in 2006 Eric Britton, an activist and Wikipedia editor personally acquainted with Zuckermann, obtained the sentence when he asked Zuckermann to check the accuracy of an earlier version of this article (see ). Kottick (2003:461-462), who also knew Zuckermann in the role of business representative, cites personal taste, saying \\"his travels brought him to the realization that he was a European at heart.\\" Michael Stone, quoted above, cites the harsh political climate of America in 1969. He left New York for England, where he bought and moved into Stafford Barton,Stafford Barton appears as the byline on Zuckermann's columns in The Harpsichord (see below), and as his address as a Zuckermann Harpsichords sales agent (). a 15th century house in rural Devonshire with 28 acres of fields and gardens.Sources: David Jacques Way, \\"Appendix - By a Harpsichord Kit Builder\\", final chapter of The Modern Harpsichord. Way described Zuckermann's departure thus: \\"he dreams of retiring [to Stafford Barton] for a part of each year to work out improvements in his instruments.\\" There, he \\"r[a]n a crafts business, ... work[ing] with kids who would otherwise be dropouts\\"; he also \\"play[ed] chamber music and tennis with the local gentry.\\" He reported his experience, and his thoughts about England, in a 1971 contribution to The Village Voice.See Zuckermann (1971:11), from which quotations in this paragraph are drawn. With time, Zuckermann shifted his emphasis from harpsichords to his second career as a political activist. He played an active part in creating small local collaborative projects that cut away from the values and patterns of the dominant consumer society. While living in London, he noted the five hundred mews (former stable blocks) in that city as, contrary to professional planning views at the time, a viable city environment, and proceeded to write with co- author Barbara Rosen The Mews of London: A Guide to the Hidden Byways of London's Past (1982). In 1987 Zuckermann began his collaboration with The Commons, an independent non-profit policy research group based in Paris. Through 1994 he was a Senior Associate, writer and editor of a program called the New Mobility Agenda which looks at ways in which we could arrange our transportation (and our lives) so that people could obtain better access to the places they live and work. The project eventually led to a search for ideas, suggestions, and possible solutions from people and places around the world. Zuckermann's significant experience as a 'kit builder' on a large international scale was one of the important driving forces behind the program and its various spin-offs and demonstration projects. End of the Road (1991) was written as an attempt to pull together all the rich body of information and ideas being generated by the New Mobility project, in an easily readable form, addressed to the general public, and put into jargon-free and vivid language not generally found in the transportation literature. Zuckermann followed this up with a number of other EcoPlan projects such as co-author of a children's book, Family Mouse Behind the Wheel (1992), as well as taking a leading role in The Commons Car Free Days program. His book Alice in Underland (2000) looks at today's technology and society matters (and manners) from a perspective somewhat different from that usually encountered in the literature. In 1994 Zuckermann collaborated with Eric Britton, with whom he had worked much earlier on the Sundance Festival, to create an interactive program under The Commons for something they called \\"Consumer Holiday ‚Äì The one day a year we turn off the economy and think about it\\". Shortly however they became aware of a well financed Canadian program with many of the same objectives, Buy Nothing Day, and decided to convert their collaborative project into an international support site that looked at a broader range of problems, ideas, paths and solutions, which would help to amplify and compete the Canadian project. Thus the International Buy Nothing Day program was born and continues to this day. Zuckermann moved to France around 1995. Following the move he continued his research, writing, and editing activities with The Commons.Zuckermann's whereabouts in the years between Devon and Avignon have not been systematically traced. The harpsichord builder David Calhoun reported to a listserv in 1996 that \\"He lived on the American eastern seaboard for a while, restoring an old house or three there.\\" (source: ).

The discussion above of the 1982 book The Mews of London mentions a period of residence in London that catalyzed the book. An article that Zuckermann wrote for the magazine The Oldie (Zuckermann 2001) related that in the 1980s he was living in \\"a hamlet a few kilometers from Sommi√®res in the South of France\\".

As bookstore owner Wolfgang Zuckermann photographed in his Avignon bookshop in 2005 In June 1994 he became founder and owner-manager of Shakespeare, an English- language bookstore and arts center in Avignon, named after a famous earlier \\"Shakespeare\\" bookstore run in Paris in the early 20th century by Sylvia Beach (Beach was the first publisher of James Joyce's oft-censored novel Ulysses.) Zuckermann and Britton described the store as \\"a bookstore and arts center ... which resolutely refuses the separation of 'culture' from the issues of technology, society and personal responsibility.\\"Source: 2006 edit to this encyclopedia made by Britton under Zuckermann's guidance; A 2008 visitor described the store thus, \\"A small but well stocked hideaway just inside the medieval city walls near Porte St Lazare, the shop is infused with the character of its owner. Customers whisper and books are taken from the shelves with reverence, as the dignified, silver-haired Wolfgang Zuckermann presides in benign tranquillity. Even in the caf√© (where Mr Zuckermann will rustle you up a surprising - and surprisingly good - English cream tea with home-made scones) the only sounds are quiet chewing, tinkling china, pages turning and murmurs of literary conversation.\\"Sam Jordison, in The Guardian; Zuckermann retired from running the bookstore in 2012; it still exists under other ownership.http://www.marvellous-provence.com/avignon/practical- information/useful-contacts He died in late 2018 in Avignon, France. Miscellany *Zuckermann reported his favorite composer to be Joseph Haydn, noting that rather few of this composer's most celebrated works were written for harpsichord. *To illustrate the point that harpsichord builders are not always personally efficient he mentioned (in The Modern Harpsichord, p. 68) that he spent a fair amount of the time in his Greenwich Village workshop building medieval furniture. *In response to an article in the New York Times (1996) describing the \\"McTheory\\" that no two countries with McDonald's restaurants had ever gone to war with one another, he penned a letter to the editor saying, \\" I used to consider myself a pacifist, but after reading Mr. Friedman's McTheory ... I can't help wishing that such countries would declare war against each other ‚Äî and target their missiles exclusively on each other's McDonald's. That way there would be one less, instead of one more, McDonald's every three hours.\\" NotesReferences Books and articles by Wolfgang [Wallace] Zuckermann: *Wallace Zuckermann (1968) \\"How to get into business without really trying\\" [autobigraphical essay].

It was described as the only \\"hypsilophodont\\" known from South America, although this assessment is not universally supported, and Gasparinisaura is now believed to have been a basal euornithopod as well. History of discovery From 1985 onwards the Laboratorio de Paleovertebrados of the Universidad Nacional de la Patagonia \\"San Juan Bosco\\" organised excavations in the late Cenomanian-early Turonian-age Bajo Barreal Formation of the San Jorge Basin, northern Chubut, Patagonia. At Buen Pasto near Comodoro Rivadavia a partial juvenile skeleton lacking the skull, was found. In 1998 this find was named and described by Rub√©n D. Mart√≠nez as the type species Notohypsilophodon comodorensis. The generic name combines a Greek ŒΩœåœÑŒøœÇ, notos, \\"south wind\\" with the name of the genus Hypsilophodon. The specific name refers to Comodoro Rivadavia. Notohypsilophodon is based on the holotype specimen UNPSJB -- PV 942, a partial skeleton including four neck, seven back, five hip, and six tail vertebrae, four rib fragments, a partial left scapula (shoulder blade), partial right coracoid, a right humerus (upper arm bone), both ulnae, and most of a left leg (minus the foot), a right fibula and astragalus, and thirteen phalanges. Because the neural arches are not fused to the bodies of the vertebrae, its describer regarded the individual as not fully grown. Description As a \\"hypsilophodontid\\" or other basal ornithopod, Notohypsilophodon would have been a bipedal herbivore. Its size was not estimated in the describing article, but as most adult hypsilophodonts were long, this genus would probably have been of similar size. In 2010 Gregory S. Paul gave an estimation of for the length, for the weight of the animal.Paul, G.S., 2010, The Princeton Field Guide to Dinosaurs, Princeton University Press p. 277 Phylogeny Mart√≠nez found no evidence that Notohypsilophodon was an iguanodont, and instead assigned it to the more basal Hypsilophodontidae, which made it at the time the only South American hypsilophodont. A hypsilophodontid assignment was supported by Rodolfo Coria in a 1999 review of South American ornithopods, but a more recent review of basal ornithopods found the fossil remains to be too fragmentary for classification beyond Euornithopoda, a clade within Ornithopoda including the \\"hypsilophodonts\\" and iguanodonts. Moreover, the Hypsilophodontidae are today considered to be a paraphyletic group, not consisting of directly related species forming a separate branch, but representing a series of successive branches splitting off the main euornithopod tree. A recent redescription of Notohypsilophodon found it to be basal in Ornithopoda, more primitive than Gasparinisaura. In 2015, it was found to be part of the clade Elasmaria along with other Antarctic and Patagonian ornithopods.

Truman against an armed attack on November 1, 1950, at Blair House, where the president was living during renovations at the White House. Coffelt was wounded during the assassination attempt, which two Puerto Rican nationalists carried out. Though mortally wounded by three bullets, Coffelt returned fire moments later and killed one of the attackers with a single shot to the head. The other was convicted by a federal jury and sentenced to death; Truman commuted the sentence to life imprisonment and the man was released from jail in 1979. Acknowledging the importance of the question of Puerto Rico's status, Truman authorized a referendum in Puerto Rico in 1952 to determine its relationship to the U.S. Personal life Leslie Coffelt was born to Will Coffelt and Effie Keller in the Shenandoah Valley town of Oranda, Virginia. He had 4 siblings; Harry, Hollis, Norman, and Mildred. He grew up hunting and handling firearms. Coffelt was the second in his family to graduate from high school, and he was described by those who knew him as an expert sharpshooter. Coffelt met and fell in love with Chessie Elinor Morgan of Uniontown, Pennsylvania, who was training to become a nurse. Coffelt and Morgan were married on October 5, 1937, in Prince George's County, Maryland. They moved into an apartment in Washington. Coffelt was also a Freemason and a member of Potomac Lodge #5 F.A.A.M. in Georgetown, Washington D.C. Career In 1928, Coffelt left Oranda to look for a job in Washington, D.C., and became a police officer with the Metropolitan Police Department in 1929. He was assigned to Precinct 3, which ran the length of K Street. In 1936, he resigned to become a building technician. In 1941, Coffelt returned to the Metropolitan Police. In 1942 he requested and was awarded a transfer to the White House Police. That year, as the US entered World War II, Coffelt was drafted and assigned to B Company, 300th Infantry Regiment, United States Army. Coffelt served less than two years and never made it overseas; the Army gave him a medical discharge. In 1945, he returned to duty with the White House Police. Truman assassination attempt On November 1, 1950, would-be assassins Griselio Torresola and Oscar Collazo, nationalists who supported the independence of Puerto Rico from the United States, attacked officers at the Blair House in order to assassinate President Truman. He was living there because of a major renovation at the White House for structural problems. Torresola approached from the west side while Collazo engaged Secret Service agents and White House policemen from the east. Torresola approached the guard booth at the west corner of the Blair House and fired at Coffelt from close range. His three shots struck Coffelt in the chest and abdomen, mortally wounding him. A fourth shot passed through the policeman's tunic. Torresola shot two other policemen before running out of ammunition, then moved to the left of the Blair House steps to reload. Coffelt went out of his booth and fired at Torresola from away, hitting him behind the ear and killing him instantly. Coffelt limped back to the booth and blacked out. He died of his wounds four hours later in a hospital. A plaque on the Blair House fence commemorates Officer Coffelt's sacrifice. Aftermath President Truman wrote in a letter a short time later: > I'm sorry I didn‚Äôt get to talk to you and (cousin) Nellie at the dinner or > after it. But I'm really a prisoner now. > ...The grand guards who were hurt in the attempt on me didn't have a fair > chance.

They won't let me go walking or even cross the > street on foot. I say 'they' won't, but it causes them so much anguish that > I conform ... But I want no more guards killed. - Letter from Truman to his > cousin, Ethel Noland, dated November 17, 1950 Coffelt's tombstone at Arlington National Cemetery Coffelt's widow, Cressie E. Coffelt, was later asked by the President and the Secretary of State to go to Puerto Rico, to accept the condolences and expressions of sorrow for her husband's death from various Puerto Rican leaders and crowds. Mrs. Coffelt made a speech acknowledging that the island's people were not responsible for the acts of Collazo and Torresola. Oscar Collazo was convicted and sentenced to death in federal court; Truman commuted the sentence to life imprisonment. Acknowledging the importance of the question of Puerto Rican independence, Truman allowed a plebiscite in Puerto Rico in 1952 to determine the status of its relationship to the U.S. The people voted to continue as a Free Associated State, as established in 1950. Private Coffelt was buried in Arlington National Cemetery on November 4, 1950, in Section 17, Site 17719-59. His epitaph reads, \\"White House Policeman: Who Gave His Life in Defense of the President of the United States During an Assassination Attempt at the Blair House, Washington, D.C.\\" To this day, Coffelt is one of only four Secret Service members to take a bullet while defending the President, the others being Donald Birdzell and Joseph Downs, who were wounded during the same incident, and Tim McCarthy, who was wounded in the abdomen by John Hinckley Jr. during the attempted assassination of Ronald Reagan. A plaque at the Blair House commemorates Coffelt's sacrifice, heroism, and fidelity to his duty and his country. The day room for the U.S. Secret Service's Uniformed Division at the Blair House is named for Coffelt as well. In 1979, President Jimmy Carter commuted Collazo's sentence to time served, and granted the man release. Collazo returned to Puerto Rico, where he died in 1994.

It is situated just north of the River Avon, close to the Kelston and Saltford locks. The parish has a population of 248. History The village pump and trough, bearing the symbol of the Inigo- Jones Estate at Kelston Park, which carried out works in the village in the mid 1800s Kelston was part of the hundred of Bath Forum. The name of the village was recorded as Calveston in 1178. The familiar -ton ending indicates farmstead or estate. The first part of the name may mean \\"belonging to a person, possibly Celf or Caelf\\".Mills, A.D., Oxford Dictionary of English Place Names, Oxford 1991, revised 1996 However, it may mean a place where calves were reared.Davey, Cyril, West Country Place Names and What They Mean, Abson, 1983 It is the site of the Elizabethan Kelston Manor House, built by the Harington family and demolished in the 18th century. Kelston railway station was on the now-closed Midland Railway line between Bath Green Park and Mangotsfield. The station was three-quarters of a mile across the fields from the village, near the bridge that carried the line and a footpath across the Avon to Saltford. It was known in railway timetables as \\"Kelston (for Saltford)\\". It opened four months after the railway line opened in 1869 and closed at the end of 1948. Trains continued to use the line until its closure in 1966 under the Beeching Axe. The track is now used for the Bristol & Bath Railway Path. Governance The parish council has responsibility for local issues, including setting an annual precept (local rate) to cover the council‚Äôs operating costs and producing annual accounts for public scrutiny. The parish council evaluates local planning applications and works with the local police, district council officers, and neighbourhood watch groups on matters of crime, security, and traffic. The parish council's role also includes initiating projects for the maintenance and repair of parish facilities, such as the village hall or community centre, playing fields and playgrounds, as well as consulting with the district council on the maintenance, repair, and improvement of highways, drainage, footpaths, public transport, and street cleaning. Conservation matters (including trees and listed buildings) and environmental issues are also of interest to the council. The parish falls within the unitary authority of Bath and North East Somerset which was created in 1996, as established by the Local Government Act 1992. It provides a single tier of local government with responsibility for almost all local government functions within their area including local planning and building control, local roads, council housing, environmental health, markets and fairs, refuse collection, recycling, cemeteries, crematoria, leisure services, parks, and tourism. They are also responsible for education, social services, libraries, main roads, public transport, Trading Standards, waste disposal and strategic planning, although fire, police and ambulance services are provided jointly with other authorities through the Avon Fire and Rescue Service, Avon and Somerset Constabulary and the Great Western Ambulance Service. Bath and North East Somerset's area covers part of the ceremonial county of Somerset but it is administered independently of the non-metropolitan county. Its administrative headquarters are in Bath. Between 1 April 1974 and 1 April 1996, it was the Wansdyke district and the City of Bath of the county of Avon. Before 1974 that the parish was part of the Bathavon Rural District. The parish is represented in the House of Commons of the Parliament of the United Kingdom as part of North East Somerset. It elects one Member of Parliament (MP) by the first past the post system of election. Landmarks Church of St Nicholas The churchyard at Kelston is the burial place of Sir John Harington, author, epigramist and inventor of the flush toilet (water closet), the first model of which he installed at Richmond Palace for his godmother, Queen Elizabeth I. Kelston Park was built around the 1760s by John Wood, the Younger, for Sir Caesar Hawkins, who was the physician to the King. It has been designated as a Grade II* listed building. Kelston also has an 18th-century Village lock-up. Religious sites The Anglican parish Church of St. Nicholas dates from the 13th and 14th century although it was heavily restored and rebuilt in 1860 by Benjamin Ferrey.

It is bounded by a mixture of sedimentary basins and Proterozoic fold and thrust belts. Zircon grains in the Jack Hills, Narryer Terrane have been dated at ~4.27 Ga, with one detrital zircon dated as old as 4.4 Ga.Earlier known as Yilgarn Block , section Yilgarn Block by I. R. Williams page 33‚Äì81. The Murchinson Province of the craton contains the oldest dated meteorite impact crater, at 2229 ¬± 5 Ma.  Geology  The Yilgarn Craton appears to have been assembled between ~2.94 and 2.63 Ga by the accretion of a multitude of formerly present blocks or terranes of existing continental crust, most of which formed between 3.2 Ga and 2.8 Ga. This accretion event is recorded by widespread granite and granodiorite intrusions, which comprise over 70% of the Yilgarn craton; voluminous tholeiitic basalt and komatiite volcanism;Chen, She Fa, John E. Greenfield, David R. Nelson, Angela Riganti, and Steven Wyche. (2003) \\"Lithostratigraphy and tectonic evolution of contrasting greenstone successions in the central Yilgarn Craton, Western Australia\\". Precambrian Research, Vol. 127, Issues 1-3 , 10 November, pp. 249‚Äì266. regional metamorphism and deformation as well as the emplacement of the vast majority of the craton's endowment in gold mineralisation. These accretion events occurred in several phases, probably by accretion of continental fragments separated by pauses in subduction, with renewed activity occurring episodically. The craton is primarily composed of approximately 2.8 billion year old (~2.8 Ga) granite-gneiss metamorphic terrain (the Southwestern Province and Western Gneiss Belt), and three granite-greenstone terrains (the North-East Goldfields, the Southern Cross and the greenschist metamorphic Murchison Provinces). Some greenstone belts and granites are as old as 3.1-2.9 Ga, and some are younger, at ~2.75-2.65 Ga. The craton is one of the distinct physiographic provinces of the West Australian Shield physiographic division, which comprises the Stirling-Mount Barren Block, Darling Hills, and Recherche Shelf sections. Western Gneiss Terrane Basic geological regions of Australia, by age The Western Gneiss Terrane is a series of polydeformed high-grade early Archaean metamorphic belts, composed predominantly of feldspathic leucocratic granulite gneisses, which represent some of the oldest crustal fragments on Earth. The Western Gneiss Terrane is distinct from the remainder of the Yilgarn Craton in that the latter has a predominance of metavolcanic rocks, both felsic and mafic, whereas the former consists of high-grade metasediments and gneisses of unknown protolith. The Western Gneiss Terrane is exposed along the western half of the northern margin of the Yilgarn Craton as the Narryer Gneiss Terrane, a composite of heavily polydeformed feldspathic metagranite and metasedimentary amphibolite- grade gneisses and migmatites, dated at greater than 3.3 Ga and up to 3.8 Ga in age, flanked by the Murgoo Gneiss Terrane (2.95 Ga), as well as sheets of 2.75 Ga to 2.6 Ga granite, obducted ophiolite sheets (the Trillbar Complex) and some 2.4 Ga to 2.0 Ga Proterozoic gneiss belts. On the western edge of the Yilgarn Craton, partially covered by Phanerozoic sedimentary basins and in faulted contact with the 2.7 Ga to 2.55 Ga Yilgarn tectonic domains, lies the Jumperding Gneiss Complex of 2.75 to 2.65 Ga age, composed primarily of micaceous quartzite, quartz-feldspar-biotite-garnet gneiss, andalusite and sillimanite schists, banded iron formation and other exotics, intruded by minor masses of porphyritic granite. Detrital zircons in the Jumperding Gneiss Complex range in age from 3267 ¬± 30 Ma to 3341 ¬± 100 Ma, with metamorphic overgrowth dated at 3180 Ma. On the southwest of the Yilgarn Craton the Balingup Gneiss Complex is situated inboard from the Early Proterozoic Leeuwin Complex of metamorphic rocks. The Balingup Complex consists primarily of metasedimentary paragneiss, granite orthogneiss, with minor layers of calc- silicate, ultramafic and ortho-amphibolite gneiss. The metamorphic grade is considered to be peak granulite facies, but the majority has preserved peak amphibolite facies assemblages. In total, the Western Gneiss Terrane sub- blocks represent an earlier substrate upon which the majority of the Yilgarn Craton's about 2.70 to 2.55 Ga greenstone metavolcanic belts have been deposited and into which the voluminous Archaean trondhjemite-tonalite- granodiorite (TTG) suite and trondhjemite-tonalite-diorite (TTD) suite granites were emplaced. Murchison Province The Murchison Province is exposed in the western and northern third of the Yilgarn Craton. The Province is bounded by major transcrustal structures which separate it from the surrounding tectonic provinces of the craton and the Western Gneiss Belt. The Murchison Province Stratigraphy, after Watkins (1990), is divided into six basic structural-stratigraphic components - two greenstone belt metavolcanic- metasedimentary sequences and four suites of granitoids. * Luke Creek Group metavolcanics * Mount Farmer Group * Early granodiorite-monzogranite intrusive suite (now pegmatite-banded orthogneiss) * Monzogranite Suite (now folded, metagranite) * Two post-tectonic differentiated suites of granitoid rocks The structural framework in the northeastern Yilgarn craton was largely shaped by transpression that led to the development of folds, reverse faults, sinistral strike-slip movement on NNW-trending regional shear zones, followed by regional folding and shortening. The later occurred in overlapping tectonic processes. The first deformation event is poorly understood but appears to have involved N-S thrusting. The Murchinson Province contains the Yarrabubba crater, which is the oldest dated meteorite impact crater, at 2229 ¬± 5 Ma. The crater is heavily eroded and nothing remains of the original structure. There is an elliptical aero-magnetic anomaly, measuring approximately 20km by 11km. This impact may have ended the Huronian glaciation period of the Snowball Earth geologic era. Southern Cross Province The Southern Cross Province lies in the central area of the Yilgarn craton. The Marda‚ÄìDiemals greenstone belt in the Southern Cross Terrane can be divided into three layers: the lower greenstone belt (ca. 3.0 Ga) characterized by mafic volcanic rock and banded iron formation, a felsic-intermediate volcanism layer, and an upper sedimentary layer (ca. 2.73 Ga) of calc-alkaline volcanic (Marda Complex) and clastic sedimentary rocks (Diemals Formation).Swager, C. P., Witt W. K., Griffin A. L., Ahmat A. L., Hunter W. M., McGoldrick P. J. & Wyche, S., 1992. Late Archaean Granite-Greenstones of the Kalgoorlie Terrane, Yilgarn Craton, Western Australia in The Archaean: Terrains, Processes and Metallogeny, University of Western Australia, Publication 22, pp. 39‚Äì49. East‚ÄìWest orogeny (ca. 2730‚Äì2680 Ma) occurred in two stages; an earlier folding phase and a late phase that resulted in deposition and deformation of the Diemals Formation. Subsequent orogeny (ca. 2680‚Äì2655 Ma) resulted in shear zones and arcuate structures. The lithostratigraphy of the Marda‚ÄìDiemals greenstone belt are similar to the northern Murchison Terrane, but has older greenstones and deformation events than the southern Eastern Goldfields Terrane. This indicates that the Eastern Goldfields Terrane may have accreted to an older Murchison‚ÄìSouthern Cross granite‚Äìgreenstone nucleus. Eastern Goldfield Province The Archaean Norseman-Wiluna Greenstone BeltHammond, R. L. & Nisbett B. W., 1992. Towards a Structural and Tectonic Framework for the central Norseman-Wiluna Greenstone Belt, Western Australia in The Archaean: Terrains, Processes and Metallogeny, University of Western Australia, Publication 22, pp. 39‚Äì49. in the Eastern Goldfield Province contains most of Australia's lode gold deposits, including the famous Kalgoorlie Golden Mile containing the Super Pit. These gold deposits are generally of large tonnage and are confined to the volcanic-intrusive-sedimentary sequences of the greenstone belts and not the granites. There is a pattern of gold distribution along the Archean Boulder-Lefroy shear zone. Extrusive komatiites (ultramafic volcanic rocks) occur along the Norseman-Wiluna Greenstone Belt. A change from volcanic-dominated to plutonic-dominated magmatism occurred in the Norseman- Wiluna Greenstone Belt approximately 2685‚Äì2675 Ma. Voluminous high-Ca granite intrusions occurred 2670‚Äì2655 Ma.Moresi, Louis, Peter van der Borgh, and Roberto F. Weinberg. (2003) \\"Timing of deformation in the Norseman-Wiluna Belt, Yilgarn Craton, Western Australia\\". Precambrian Research, Vol. 120, Issues 3-4, 10 February, pp. 219‚Äì239. Much of the gold was deposited between 2650‚Äì2630 Ma, with much of this associated with strike-slip reactivation of earlier faults (normal and reverse). An earlier gold event 2660-2655 Ma was associated with major extension (normal faulting and granite doming) resulting in the formation of late basins and the intrusion of mantle-derived magmas (syenites and Mafic-type granites/porphyries) and tight anticlockwise PTt paths.  Bounding terranes  The Yilgarn Craton is bound on all sides by younger terranes of various ages, but predominantly of Proterozoic age. The boundaries between the various flanking terranes provide considerable evidence of the post-Archaean events which have involved the Yilgarn Craton. Perth Basin The Yilgarn Craton is bound on the western side by the Perth Basin, of Jurassic age, and is separated from this basin by the Darling Fault. The Perth Basin is considered to be a rift fill basin formed on a passive margin. Gascoyne Complex The Perth Basin is bound on the north by the Gascoyne Complex,Cawood, P. A. and Tyler, I. M., 2004.

Glengarry Basin and Yerrida Basin, which are all part of a middle Proterozoic mobile belt which leads east to the Musgrave Block. The Gascoyne complex and other metamorphic belts of this age including reactivation of the Yarlarweelor Gneiss and Narryer Gneiss Terrane, indicate prolonged multi-phased strike-slip movement (relative to the Yilgarn Craton margin) from the late Archaean through to neoproterozoic and even into the Palaeozoic.Sheppard, S., Occhipinti, S. A. and Nelson, D. R., 2005. Intracontinental reworking in the Capricorn Orogen, Western Australia: the 1680‚Äì1620 Ma Mangaroon Orogeny. Australian Journal of Earth Sciences, 52, p. 443‚Äì460. Albany-Fraser Orogen The Yilgarn Craton is bounded on the east-southeast by the ~1,300 Ma Albany-Fraser Orogen, composed primarily of amphibolite to greenschist facies sedimentary protolith gneisses, migmatites and granites. The Albany-Fraser Orogen displays both subduction-related and prolonged strike-slip tectonic structures and is intimately interconnected with the other Proterozoic basins and mobile belts of Australia. Sedimentary basin cover The Yilgarn Craton is partially covered by onlapping sedimentary basins of Palaeozoic and Phanerozoic age in the east and north-east, including the Canning Basin. It is bounded on the western edge by the Darling Scarp and Darling Fault which separate the Yilgarn Craton from the Perth Basin to the west, and is covered by several remnant sedimentary basins of Jurassic age such as the Collie Sub-Basin. The Yilgarn Craton also has a considerable Tertiary and younger sedimentary veneer of palaeochannel deposits derived from prolonged erosion, sedimentation and redeposition of older cover sequences and regolith as well as the Archaean basement itself. Recognised Tertiary cover sequences include the Bremer Basin, Officer Basin and others. Regolith The Yilgarn craton is believed to have remained at or above sea level for a considerable length of time. Some of the Yilgarn regolith is the oldest in the world, recording weathering events as early as the Cretaceous Period. This has been created by the generally subtropical latitudes and conditions of the Yilgarn craton, with minimal to no glaciation and generally flat topographical relief resulting in comparatively minor erosion. The regolith is extremely deeply weathered, in some areas completely converted to saprolite up to 100 metres below surface. This is considered to have been produced during Caenozoic to Palaeocene tropical conditions, as evidenced by mottled duricrust which records fossilised tree roots, some over 60 million years old. Previous weathering events have been recorded in magnetically remnant ferruginous laterite of a Jurassic age, at about 180 Ma. The regolith of the Yilgarn impacts directly on the flora and fauna, as some of the soil is essentially fossilised. Much of the groundwater of the Yilgarn is hypersaline, with some being supersaturated in salt. This renders swathes of land barren, with significant salt lakes, and high saline water tables. The origin of this salt is thought to be from precipitation of sea salt carried over the Australian landmass for the past several dozen million years, and the high evaporation rate leaving the salt behind. The greenstone belts of the Yilgarn Craton include: * Southern Cross Greenstone Belt * Norseman-Wiluna Belt * Duketon Belt * Gullewa Greenstone Belt Economic geology The Yilgarn Craton is Australia's premier mineral province. It attracts more than half of Australia's minerals exploration expenditure, and produces two thirds of all gold and most of the nickel mined in Australia. The craton contains some 30% of the world's known gold reserves, about 20% of the world's nickel reserves, 80% of the world's tantalum reserves, considerable iron ore, copper, zinc and minor lead reserves. The craton contains significant platinum, vanadium, hard-rock titanium and considerable iron ore resources. Mining is conducted mostly in the greenstone belts around mining centres such as Kalgoorlie, Kambalda, Norseman, Meekatharra and Wiluna, and minor centres such as Laverton, Leinster, Leonora and Southern Cross. Ore concentrates or finished product are transported by rail or road to Perth, Fremantle, Esperance, Albany or Geraldton. Iron ore Iron ore is currently recovered from several areas in the Yilgarn Craton, although it is a much smaller set of mines than those in the Pilbara Craton. Iron ore is mined at Koolyanobbing, north of Kalgoorlie from hematite weathered banded iron formation (BIF), at Mount Gibson, Weld Range and Jack Hills in the Western Gneiss Terrane from hematised BIF to produce direct- shipping ore. The Karara Iron Ore Project is the only operational magnetite mine in the Yilgarn Craton, however, other magnetite iron ore deposits are being investigated as a source of magnetite ore in the Albany-Fraser Complex, where a large deposit is being proposed at Southdown. The Jack Hills, Weld Range and Mount Gibson banded iron formations, as well as BIFs around Yalgoo, are also considered potential sources of magnetite iron ore, although no operations are as yet running on this type of ore. Further away from the coast, BIF deposits at Wiluna and Laverton are also under investigation, although infrastructure is considered too poor to render these deposits economic. Gold The Yilgarn Craton is host to around 30% of the world's economically demonstrably recoverable reserves (EDR) of gold. Major gold deposits occur at Kalgoorlie, Kambalda, Mount Magnet, Boddington, Laverton and Wiluna, and are hosted in greenstone belts. These form linear belts of mafic, ultramafic and felsic volcanics, intercalated with sedimentary sequences, and have been deformed and metamorphosed. The mode of occurrence of the gold mineralisation tends to be small- to medium-sized structurally controlled lodes, shears, and quartz veins. A key feature beneath many of the region's gold deposits are granite-cored domes at a range of scales. These provided an architecture that focussed fluid metals into the upper crust's depositional sites. Signatures of the mantle are found in many large deposits, including melts from metasomatised mantle wedge as well as lamprophyres. Debate continues whether these mantle rocks were a fluid and/or metal source, or simply reflect a favourable pathway. Nickel-PGE deposits The greater Kambalda district hosts a world-class nickel-sulfide mining district with a total pre-mining resource of 2 megatons (Mt) of nickel metal. Approximately 1.1 Mt of nickel metal has been produced since 1967, at an average rate of 35,000 tons of nickel per year. The Kambalda Dome is located in the south- central part of the Archaean Norseman-Wiluna greenstone belt in the southeastern Yilgarn Craton. Kambalda type komatiitic nickel ore deposits are the primary source of nickel metal within the Yilgarn Craton.Hill R. E. T, Barnes S. J., Gole M. J., and Dowling S. E., 1990. Physical volcanology of komatiites; A field guide to the komatiites of the Norseman-Wiluna Greenstone Bel, Eastern Goldfields Province, Yilgarn Block, Western Australia, Geological Society of Australia. . Base metals Copper, lead and zinc are currently mined from Golden Grove and the newly developed Jaguar zinc mine. Minor amounts of copper have been recovered from several copper-bearing gold deposits such as those in the Gullewa Greenstone Belt, at Burtville south of Laverton, at Granny Smith and elsewhere. The desert area encircling Kalgoorlie, with an area of 500,000 square kilometres, is theorised to host a 100 million tonne copper-zinc deposit. The geology of several volcanic belts in the Yilgarn Craton are strikingly similar to the world's great base-metal mines at Kidd Creek in Northern Ontario, Canada. Exploration for copper is continuing in several areas around Ravensthorpe, Balagundi, in the Yandall Belt, and the Duketon Belt, where large felsic volcanic packages are known to exist.  Rare-earth elements  The Yilgarn Craton may host up to 60% of the world's recoverable rare-earth elements, primarily in the Mount Weld Carbonatite. Smaller carbonatite occurrences at Ponton, near Laverton, and regionally within the eastern granite-gneiss and greenstone belts, may also prove economic. Uranium The Yilgarn Craton and its cover sequences are host to a significant percentage of the world's endowment in economically demonstrable and recoverable reserves (EDR) of uranium. Most uranium is hosted within palaeochannels derived from granites of the Yilgarn Craton and/or its flanking Proterozoic orogens, and this metal is deposited within Tertiary or younger palaeodrainage and current drainage systems. Examples include Yeelirrie, Mulga Rock and Lake Way-Centipede. Partial list of ore deposits and mines World-class deposits in the eastern Yilgarn Craton include: Mount Charlotte, Norseman, Sunrise Dam, Sons of Gwalia, St Ives-Kambalda, Tarmoola, Wallaby and Wiluna.

It is now offline. Players receive free credits to wage against other players in return for watching a 10, 15, or 30 second video advertisement and randomly answering a trivia question about it. By extending credits to the viewer of the advertisement, players have funds to place bets against other players without risking any of their own money. These player may then 'cash out' the accumulated winnings for real cash once the equivalent of $10 or more has been reached. Moola has been \\"offline\\" for game play according to the website and has no stated timetable for resuming game play. Moola ranked 11th on PC World magazine's \\"The 15 Best Places to Waste Time on the Web\\" in 2007.Moola Review by PC World magazine  Gameplay  In the Moola's three original games, two players play against each other. Players also have the option to play against a bot (\\"AutoPlayer\\") when no human opponent is available. Players are given m$0.01 by Moola to begin betting. They may only bet in doubling amounts (1¬¢, 2¬¢, 4¬¢, 8¬¢, 16¬¢, 32¬¢, 64¬¢, $1.28, $2.56, $5.12, etc.) Moola emphasizes that by doubling winnings 30 times, a player will earn over m$10 million. When a player loses all of their money, Moola provides a penny to begin with again.  Membership  The site used to require new players to receive invitations to play from registered players. However, now new users can sign up on the main page. By inviting other players, the inviting player receives a graduated percentage of the invitee's winnings when the latter puts money into savings or receives a \\"booster\\", but only if both players provide their cell phone numbers to \\"verify\\" their accounts. Verification is done via an SMS \\"text\\" message. A player can put money from their playing account into their \\"savings account\\" so they cannot lose it, which helps players accumulate more money to cash out. The referral amount does not come out of the invitee's winnings but is instead paid by Moola to help gather new members. There are several commercial and fan-created websites created that seek to provide the invitations indirectly, so that the share of the winnings can be funneled to the creator of the site itself. Another option for an invite is to click on links given out by members, which automatically send you an invite when you fill in the appropriate information. Moola is open to Canadian and United States residents except residents in Louisiana, Nevada, and Quebec. International players can also play but they cannot verify their accounts or cash out. Moola uses Facebook so users can play games through Facebook.  Games  Moola features four main games. * Hi-Lo: A modified version of the classic game of screw the dealer, in which each player has to decide whether the next card is higher or lower than the last. If they guess correctly, the player moves on to the next card. If they guess wrong, the player loses a life and starts over from the beginning. Players may lock, which will save their position, or lock and change, to deal in a card to replace the current card, and then save your position. Locking costs the user a life. The player who ends the game with the most cards locked in wins. If both players reach the end, the player with the most lives wins. This can be best played using a card counter (see #External links). Hi-Lo is Moola's most popular game. * Ro-Sham-Bo-Fu: This game is a twist on the classic rock paper scissors, where in each of six rounds one of the available choices (e.g., rock, paper or scissors) is randomly chosen and shown. The player gets bonus points for voluntarily not using this choice, applied whether they win or lose that round. Ro-Sham-Bo-Fu is Moola's least popular game. * Gold Rush: This game involves betting gold pieces to win gold pieces, played in 6 rounds. In each round, the player has to choose one of his/her 6 gold nuggets (numbered from 1 to 6) to place on a scale against the other player's choice. The winner of the round gets the value of both nuggets as well as the randomly selected nugget which had been placed in the middle of the scales. * Charity Cash Cow: A progressive jackpot slot machine where each player has the option to bet in four different denominations (1¬¢, 4¬¢, 16¬¢, and 32¬¢ bets). As each player bets, a progressive jackpot is building until someone gets all 3 community chest symbols on the highest betting denomination. When a player wins the progressive jackpot Moola matches the jackpot amount and donates it to a charity of the winner's choice.  External Moola API games  *GamesWorldOnline: A site that offers games such as Blackjack, Five-Card Draw, Dice Poker, Guess the Numbers, Card War, Battleship, Hangman, Coin-Flip, Poor Man's Lottery, Slots, and Roulette. GWO was the first Moola enabled site. It has disabled multi-player games above level zero, slots and roulette until Moola's cashout issues are resolved. *Blimplay: This site has two main games that quickly became popular: Farkle and Progressive Lotto. Since its launch, Blimplay also released a low bid auction style game called Squeeblee, in which users must obtain the lowest unique bid to win the days prize, which had topped $100. Squeeblee has recently been disabled. Blimplay site is no longer available. *Wryer's Sports Prediction: Bet on sporting and television events. It is offline. *MoolaGamers and MoolaGaming: Two sites run by the same people. MoolaGamers is a forum that pays Moola points for users to post on it. MoolaGaming develops 3P flash games. MoolaGaming has no games, but one game is nearing completion. *DuffLotto: A new 3p site which offers single player Guess the Number and Coin-Flip  Points API  In 2008, Moola announced an API to integrate third party games with the Moola Points system, allowing them to award Moola Points. In November 2008, Moola offered Sports Prediction by Wryer and Blackjack by GamesWorldOnline. In January 2009, Five Card Draw by GamesWorldOnline was added. Playing any of the games requires setting one's account to allow third party access. One of their moderators created BlimPlay, where players can play a popular dice game, Farkle. Blackjack and Five-card draw have been removed from the site.  Tournaments  There are multiple forum-based tournaments that have gained popularity on the Moola Website, some of which have cash prizes for the winners. A few of them are: *Survivor: Moola: The first 'long-term' tournament on Moola. It can be found in the forum (as all of the tournaments are). This tournament lasts around 3 to 4 months, and it last completed its third 'season.' It is credited for being the first 'reality game show' on Moola. It was first created by a Moola member and is still being hosted by its creator. The final prize of the first, second, and third season was $20. The location of the first season was the fictional Moola Island, the second location was the Moola Outback (based on the Australian Outback), but the third was based in Egypt. Some have speculated that the fourth season will be located in Dresdonia, a fictional Middle Eastern City imagined by the host. *Moola Big Brother: Another long-term reality game show that is currently being played on Moola through the forum. Appeared after the first Survivor: Moola tournament ended. Created and hosted by another Moola member, the second season is now being played, and a new host has been introduced. *The Moola Mole: Another long-term reality game show based on the international television show, \\"The Mole\\". The Moola Mole is played on Moola through the Tournaments forum. The first season was completed by host Reflection717, who is now MIA. It is being brought back for a second season by new host horrordude0215, who is supplying the $50 pot entirely by himself. *Break The Bank: A \\"quiz show\\" run by the host of Survivor: Moola. Promises to be the biggest Jackpot in a Moola game, but the show ended up being canceled due to technical problems. *Moola Apprentice: A long-term reality game show that is played with the site's games, or random games found by the host. It is based on \\"Apprentice.\\" The host for this games also went MIA after just one season. *Moola Endurance: A long-term reality game show based on \\"Endurance. Contestants compete on the site's games, or over the internet with various games found by the host. It was also the first Moola tournament in which contestants played in pairs, testing their friendship and teamwork. *Moola's Top Designer: A spin-off of American Idol adapted for Moola's forum. Contestants compete each round to make the best signature banner or other designs. *Super Mario Mafia: A two-team game based on IRC's werewolf game with a Mario Theme. Both teams take turns trying to get rid of the other team's leader. The 8th one has just ended and the regular host MarioMaster777 has sadly told the forums not to expect another one by him too soon. *OutSider's Triva Challenges: OutSider81 runs a couple of different style trivia games, both single-player and multiplayer. There is most likely a cash prize at the end of it so people are eager to play. These however seem to have ended for now, the creator now has a \\"Bad joke of day\\". *Lotteries: Moola allows its members to run lotteries on its forum and because nobody is the same you can expect each one to be a little different. At the moment the lotteries seem to be varying between $0.01 per ticket or $0.50 per ticket! To make sure that the lotteries are fair the Hosts of the lotteries must use Random.org to find the winner! And to may sure everyone gets to have fun some players host free lotteries. *Other Games (Ex: Mafia, GTN): There is games happening in the forums a lot of the time. Before people could start one randomly if there was no buy-in but now because of a mishap where too many games were going at once there is now a queue for all games. All Moola tournaments are currently run by members of the site and not by the site administration.

Originally titled Wallachian Dances H6571p after the Moravian Wallachia region, Jan√°ƒçek later changed the title when the region's name also changed, since it reflects folk songs from that specific area.  Background  Jan√°ƒçek began to compose the first set of instrumental arrangements of folk dances in 1888. The first performance took place on 11 January 1889 in Olomouc. The composition was reworked again in 1925, when Jan√°ƒçek made a new selection and ordering of numbers, including some changes in instrumentation. The work was printed in 1928, shortly before Jan√°ƒçek's death, by Hudebn√≠ matice in Prague.  Structure  The work is split into six separate dances: # Starod√°vn√Ω (\\"the Ancient One\\"), which starts with a bright 3/4 feel that moves quickly to introduce the first melody, played by the first violin. In this movement, the melodies are based around two Lachian dances, the \\"real dance\\" and the \\"ribbon\\" or \\"club dance\\". After the opening melody, the piece finds itself in a 2/4 allegro for the second half of the ribbon dance that is a common feature of Moravian music. This effect is repeated a number of times before drawing the dance to a close. # Po≈æehnan√Ω (\\"the Blessed\\"), in which one can see where Jan√°ƒçek took his inspiration from. The opening theme is played and then repeated throughout the whole movement, a trait that was considered essential in all Moravian dances. # Dym√°k, which portrays a blacksmith at work, with strong on beats mimicking the hammer striking hot steel. This movement also increases tempo considerably over the preceding two dances, starting at an allegro but increasing to prestissimo to indicate the hot and industrious work. # Starod√°vn√Ω II, which is clearly influenced by Dvo≈ô√°k by the use of orchestration, mood and writing. The melody itself is a version of a folk tune from the Barto≈° collection and, although similar to the opening dance, varies slightly. This dance is also a lot slower compared to the opening and keeps a regular tempo through to the end helping maintain its grace. # ƒåeladensk√Ω, which was considered by Jan√°ƒçek to be exactly what a typical Czech dance should consist of in form, expression as well as style (ironically, the name may derive from Polish Czelad≈∫ or more probably from Lachian village ƒåeladn√°). Again, it uses the opening theme repeated in some form throughout the piece. As the piece progresses, this original theme is dovetailed with a second melody before two other melodies join the melee, which leads to a bright and lively end. # Pilky signifies the peasant's hurried preparations for the onset of winter where all of the firewood has to be sawed and stored. This final movement is in three very distinct sections: First, an andante con moto for the opening theme while the second, marked Pi√π mosso is a bright flighty dance. The tempo is increased before returning to the original tempo and original theme but only to be built up again for a climactic finish.

Eye black is a grease or strip applied under the eyes to reduce glare, although studies have not conclusively proven this. It is a form of functional makeup. It is often used by American football, baseball and lacrosse players to purportedly mitigate the effects of bright sunlight or stadium floodlights. However, in comparison, many other nations play similar sports, such as Rugby, Australian Rules Football, Soccer/Association Football, and Cricket, under stadium floodlights or outdoors without the players wearing any eye black, adhesive eye black stickers, or other form of functional makeup. The wearing of eye black almost uniquely by American sports players appears to have more to do with aesthetics as journalist Paul Lukas, former writer for ESPN.com notes, \\"...let's be honest: glare, shmare. The real reason everyone loves to wear eye black is that it looks totally cool, like modern war paint...\\" Varieties * Traditional grease consists of beeswax, paraffin, and carbon black. * Anti- glare face strips that emulate the grease are also commonly used. History One of the earliest known instances of a player wearing eye black is baseball legend Babe Ruth, who, in or around the 1930s, used the grease in an attempt to reduce sun glare. According to Paul Lukas of ESPN.com, eye black caught on with American football player Andy Farkas. He also states that the original eye black was made from the ashes of burned cork. 2003 study A 2003 study by Brian DeBroff and Patricia Pahk tested whether black eye grease actually had anti-glare properties. The subjects of the study were divided into three groups: wearers of eye black, wearers of anti-glare stickers, and wearers of petroleum jelly. The subjects' vision was tested using an eye chart while being exposed to natural sunlight. The study concluded that eye black reduced glare of the sun and improved contrast sensitivity, whereas commercial anti-glare stickers and petroleum jelly (the control substance) were found to be ineffective. However, the study was subject to unavoidable demand bias, wherein the test subjects could have unconsciously changed their responses during testing based on the fact that they knew which substance they were wearing. Also, the petroleum jelly could have introduced glare that would not occur on natural skin and the study did not test a control condition of natural skin. Learning bias is also a factor in the results due to chart repetition. New Hampshire study A study by Benjamin R. Powers at University of New Hampshire, which improved on DeBroff's methodology, found eye black to reduce glare from the sun in women and in those whose eye-color was not blue. The study also tested males and blue-eyed subjects. However, the results were not statistically significant (probably due to a smaller sample size of those test subjects). Some testing was also performed indoors under artificial lighting (when inclement weather prohibited outdoor testing). However, those results showed little difference and were not statistically significant. The Powers study was not a double-blind study because those in contact with the test subjects knew which substance was applied. Also, the eye tests were performed at a distance of only . MythBusters test On an episode of MythBusters, Adam Savage and Jamie Hyneman tested whether eye black reduces glare. They determined that, while eye black does not eliminate glare, it does improve an athlete's ability to differentiate between light and dark, enhancing a player's ability to track moving objects in a sunny environment.> Messages in eye black Some athletes, particularly at the college level, began a practice of writing short messages on their adhesive eye black stickers. The trend gained traction among football players in the mid-2000s, popularized by Reggie Bush, who featured homages to his hometown; other popular messages included Bible verses, memorial tributes, and licensed university logos. The displays began to garner widespread media attention surrounding Tim Tebow, who used Bible verse references. This practice was banned on April 14, 2010, when the NCAA Playing Rules Oversight Panel (PROP) approved a proposal effecting \\"that players are not allowed to have any symbols or messages on their eye black starting in the 2010 season.\\" ReferencesExternal links *The Power of Darkness  Popular Science *Eye Black Used to Cut Glare, or Turn Up Spotlight - New York Times Category:Cosmetics Category:Ophthalmology Category:Sports equipment ","title":"Eye black"},{"id":"3548913","text":"Mikhail Ivanovich Musatov (; born 23 August 1950) is a deputy of the State Duma of Russia since 1995.

Hitler Youth (Luftwaffenhelfer ‚Äì born 1927) as crew for an anti-aircraft searchlight in Berlin (1943) 2cm-antiaircraft gun with Hitler Youth (Flakhelfer ‚Äì born 1927) on the Flaktower Berlin- Gesundbrunnen (Humboldthain), 1943 A Luftwaffenhelfer, also commonly known as a Flakhelfer, was, strictly speaking, any member of the auxiliary staff of the German Luftwaffe during World War II. Such terms often implied students conscripted as child soldiers. Establishment Luftwaffenhelfer (literally, \\"air force assistants\\") were established on January 22, 1943, following implementation of the decree Kriegshilfseinsatz der Jugend bei der Luftwaffe (\\"Youth War Assistance Service in the Air Force\\"). The order called for drafting whole school classes of male students born in 1926 and 1927 into a military corps, supervised by Hitler Youth and Luftwaffe personnel. The draft was later extended to include 1928 and 1929 births. Deployment included ideological indoctrination by the Hitler Youth, military duties and limited continuation of the normal school curriculum, often by the original teachers. While the official term was Luftwaffenhelfer (HJ), the term more commonly used is \\"Flakhelfer\\" (female: Flakhelferin) (Flak-helper). The 1926‚Äì1929 births are commonly referred to as the \\"Flakhelfer-Generation\\". In German culture, the phrase is associated with the collective and incisive experience of being torn out of conventional adolescent life through circumstances of total war and being thrown into strict military service and extreme peril; in the final phase of the war, the antiaircraft batteries became preferred targets of Allied aircraft. In August 1944, some 660,000 regular male soldiers and 450,000 female helpers (anti-aircraft personnel) in all departments served with the Luftwaffe within the 'auxiliary antiaircraft defense'. Many of the girls came from the Bund Deutscher M√§del (BDM), although they had to officially join the Wehrmacht because it was forbidden for BDM members to do armed duty. In 1945, \\"Flakhelferinnen\\" and other female assistants were trained and allowed to carry weapons to defend themselves. In Latvia In April 1944 the Germans had requested the drafting of 7000 Latvian boys, aged 14‚Äì16, and 400 girls, all for service as Air Defense auxiliaries. However, the Self-Administration of Latvia refused and consented only to invite the youths to volunteer. As the situation at the Eastern Front worsened, in June and July the Self-Administration did agree to draft boys born in 1927 and 1928. From July 28 to September 9, 4139 boys were enlisted, 525 of whom were volunteers.Mangulis, V. Latvia in the Wars of the 20th Century. CHAPTER IX JULY 1941 TO MAY 8, 1945 . Historia.lv.

The type species is Opisthocoelicaudia skarzynskii. A well-preserved skeleton lacking only the head and neck was unearthed in 1965 by Polish and Mongolian scientists, making Opisthocoelicaudia one of the best known sauropods from the Late Cretaceous. Tooth marks on this skeleton indicate that large carnivorous dinosaurs had fed on the carcass and possibly had carried away the now-missing parts. To date, only two additional, much less complete specimens are known, including part of a shoulder and a fragmentary tail. A relatively small sauropod, Opisthocoelicaudia measured about in length. Like other sauropods, it would have been characterised by a small head sitting on a very long neck and a barrel shaped trunk carried by four column-like legs. The name Opisthocoelicaudia means \\"posterior cavity tail\\", alluding to the unusual, opisthocoel condition of the anterior tail vertebrae that were concave on their posterior sides. This and other skeletal features lead researchers to propose that Opisthocoelicaudia was able to rear on its hindlegs. Named and described by Polish paleontologist Maria Magdalena Borsuk-Bia≈Çynicka in 1977, Opisthocoelicaudia was first thought to be a new member of the Camarasauridae, but is currently considered a derived member of the Titanosauria. Its exact relationships within Titanosauria are contentious, but it may have been close to the North American Alamosaurus. All Opisthocoelicaudia fossils stem from the Nemegt Formation. Despite being rich in dinosaur fossils, the only other sauropod from this rock unit is Nemegtosaurus, which is known from a single skull. Since the skull of Opisthocoelicaudia remains unknown, several researchers have suggested that Nemegtosaurus and Opisthocoelicaudia may represent the same species. Sauropod footprints from the Nemegt Formation, which include skin impressions, can probably be referred to either Nemegtosaurus or Opisthocoelicaudia as these are the only known sauropods from this formation. Discovery and specimens Mounted holotype specimen The type specimen was discovered between 10 and 23 June 1965, during a joint Polish- Mongolian paleontological expedition led by Polish paleontologist Zofia Kielan-Jaworowska. The largest of a series of expeditions carried out in 1963‚Äì1971, this expedition involved 21 members, which at times were supported by additional hired Mongolian workers. The site of discovery is located in √ñmn√∂govi Province in southern Mongolia in the Altan Uul area, which exposes some 100 km2 of badlands. The sediments exposed at Altan Uul belong to the Nemegt Formation, the youngest of the three geological formations of the Nemegt Basin. Opisthocoelicaudia was the first of several important dinosaur discoveries made by the 1965 expedition. The other finds, made at different localities, include several skeletons of the tyrannosaurid Tarbosaurus as well as the type specimens of the giant ornithomimosaur Deinocheirus, the sauropod Nemegtosaurus, and the pachycephalosaur Homalocephale. Latero-ventral view of the opisthocoelous anterior tail vertebrae, which lend Opisthocoelicaudia its name On the fifth day of fieldwork, Ryszard Gradzi≈Ñski, the geologist of the expedition, found a concretion of well-preserved bones which promised to belong to a fairly complete skeleton. Excavation starting the next day revealed a nearly complete skeleton lacking only the head and neck. Until today, this specimen remains by far the most complete finding of this dinosaur. The transport of the specimen out of rough terrain caused major technical problems. Stone blocks containing the fossils had to be moved some 580 meters, dragged on improvised metal sledges made out of petrol drums, before they could be loaded onto trucks. Because the skeleton was embedded in very hard sandstone layers, several blocks weighed over a ton. On the 9th of July, the packing of the skeleton into 35 crates started for transportation to Dalanzadgad; together, the crates weighed about 12 tons. The type specimen belonged to an aged individual. Its taphonomy is unusual as it was found lying on its backin contrast, most other nearly complete dinosaur skeletons of the Nemegt Formation usually are found lying on their sides. The specimen was found encased in cross-bedded sandstone deposited by a river. Most of the discovered vertebrae were still connected together, forming a continuous series of eight dorsal, six sacral and thirty-four caudal vertebrae. An additional three vertebrae were found isolated from the series and may belong to the transitional area between back and neck. The remaining parts of the skeleton were shifted slightly out of their original anatomical position. Both the left limb and rib bones were found on the right side of the body, while conversely the right limb and rib bones were found on the left side. Bite marks have been identified on the skeleton, particularly in the pelvis and the thigh bone, showing that predators had fed on the carcass. The skull and neck are missing, indicating that the carnivores might have carried away these body parts. The completeness of the remains indicate that the individual had died near the discovery site. A flooding event might have transported the carcass a short distance and subsequently covered it with sediment, even before the soft tissue had decayed entirely. Shoulder blade and coracoid of a juvenile (ZPAL MgD-I/25c) In 1977, Polish paleontologist Maria Magdalena Borsuk-Bia≈Çynicka published her comprehensive description of the skeleton and named Opisthocoelicaudia skarzynskii as a new genus and species. The genus name, hinting at the unusual opisthocoel condition of the tail vertebrae, means \\"posterior cavity tail\\". It is derived from the Greek ·ΩÑœÄŒπœÉŒ∏ŒµŒΩ, opisthen [behind, at the back], Œ∫Œø·øñŒªŒøœÇ, koilos [hollow], and Latin cauda [tail].Hentschel, E., & Wagner, G. (1990). Zoologisches W√∂rterbuch. Tiernamen, allgemeinbiologische, anatomische, physiologische Termini und biographische Daten (4th edition). Stuttgart: Gustav Fischer. The specific name honors Wojciech Skar≈ºy≈Ñski, the person who prepared the type specimen. Opisthocoelicaudia was only the third sauropod from Asia known from a postcranial skeleton, after Euhelopus and Mamenchisaurus. After its discovery, the holotype skeleton became part of the collection of the Institute of Paleobiology in Warsaw, but later was handed back to its country of origin, now being housed at the Institute of Geology of the Mongolian Academy of Sciences in Ulaanbaatar under the catalog number MPC-D100/404. Besides the type specimen, Borsuk-Bia≈Çynicka described a shoulder blade and coracoid (ZPAL MgD-I/25c) from the same locality. These bones were not yet fused to each other, indicating a juvenile individual. By 2017, sauropod fossils had been recovered from a total of 32 localities within the Nemegt Formation, and possibly belong to either Opisthocoelicaudia or Nemegtosaurus. At least two finds from the Nemegt localitya fragmentary tail (MPD 100/406) and a pair of clawsshow features diagnostic for Opisthocoelicaudia and can be referred to the latter. Field crews led by Philip Currie attempted to relocate the Opisthocoelicaudia holotype quarry in 2006 and 2008, but became successful only in 2009 thanks to additional data provided by Gradzi≈Ñski. Although a prospection for additional bone material was not possible as the quarry had been filled by windblown sand, the quarry could be determined to fall within the lower portion of the Nemegt Formation. Description Life restoration Size diagram Like other sauropods, Opisthocoelicaudia had a small head on a long neck, a barrel-shaped body on four columnar limbs, and a long tail. It was relatively small for a sauropod; the type specimen was estimated at to from the head to the tip of the tail. The body mass has been estimated at , , , and in separate studies. The skull and neck are not preserved, but the reconstruction of the nuchal ligament indicates the possession of a neck of medium length of roughly . Borsuk-Bia≈Çynicka, in her 1977 description, noted the presence of eleven dorsal vertebrae. Gregory Paul in 2019, however, argued that the known part of the vertebral column actually includes the first cervical (neck vertebra), leaving only ten dorsals, typical of titanosaurs. As in other titanosaurs, the back was quite flexible due to the lack of accessory vertebral joints (hyposphene-hypantrum articulations), while the pelvic region was strengthened by an additional sixth hip vertebra. The anterior vertebrae of the tail were opisthocoelous, which means they were convex on their anterior sides and concave on their back sides, forming ball-and-socket joints. These opisthocoelous tail vertebrae lend Opisthocoelicaudia its name and serve to distinguish the genus from all other titanosaurs. Other titanosaurs were usually characterised by strongly procoelous anterior tail vertebrae, which were concave on their anterior sides and convex on their back sides. Another unique feature can be found in the back vertebrae, which show bifurcated spinous processes, resulting in a double row of bony projections along the top of the spine. While unique in titanosaurs, this feature can be found in several other unrelated sauropods, including Diplodocus and Euhelopus, where it evolved independently. The ischium and pubis bones. The gap normally present between these bones is closed, a characteristic of Opisthocoelicaudia. As in the hips of other titanosaurs, the ischium was relatively short, measuring only two-thirds the length of the pubis. The left and right ischium bones as well as the left and right pubis bones were ossified with each other over most of their length, closing the gap that in other sauropods is normally present between these bones. The limbs were proportionally short, as seen in other titanosaurs. The forelimbs measured in height in the nearly complete specimen, approximately two thirds the length of the hindlimbs, which were reconstructed at height. As in other titanosaurs, the limbs were slightly spread outwards rather than standing vertically under the body, while the forelimbs were more flexible and mobile compared to other sauropods. Limbs of Opisthocoelicaudia, showing the digit-less semicircular hands and the fully developed feet The manus was composed merely of the five metacarpalia, which were orientated vertically and arranged in a semicircle. Carpal bones were missing, as in other titanosaurs. Finger bones and claws were also completely absentin most other titanosaurs, these bones were still present though extremely reduced in size. In the foot, the talus bone was strongly reduced as in other titanosaurs, while the calcaneus was probably completely absent in Opisthocoelicaudia. In contrast to the manus, the foot showed well developed digits and claws. The phalangeal formula, which states the number of phalanges (digit bones) beginning with the innermost digit, is 2-2-2-1-0. Foot skeletons of titanosaurs are rarely found, and besides Opisthocoelicaudia, completely preserved examples are known only from Epachthosaurus and the unnamed La Invernada titanosaur, whose phalangeal formulas are 2-2-3-2-0 and 2-2-2-2-0, respectively. Of these three titanosaurs, Opisthocoelicaudia was the most derived while showing the fewest phalanges, indicating a progressive reduction in the phalangeal count during titanosaur evolution. The claw of the first digit was not larger than that of the second digit, as in other sauropods, but roughly equal in size. Osteoderms (bony plates formed in the skin) have been found with at least 10 titanosaur genera. The lack of osteoderms in the nearly complete Opisthocoelicaudia skeleton might indicate they are absent in this genus. However, the closely related Alamosaurus was found to have osteoderms nearly a century after its discovery, in addition to several other closely related titanosaurs, thus raising the possibility that Opisthocoelicaudia had them as well. Classification Originally, Opisthocoelicaudia was classified as a member of the family Camarasauridae, together with Camarasaurus and Euhelopus. This classification was based on several shared features of the skeleton, most importantly the forked neural spines of the back vertebrae. In 1977, Borsuk- Bia≈Çynicka considered Opisthocoelicaudia closer to Euhelopus than to Camarasaurus, placing it in the subfamily Euhelopodinae. A 1981 study by Walter Coombs and Ralph Molnar, on the other hand, considered it a member of the subfamily Camarasaurinae and therefore a close relative of Camarasaurus. Today, both Euhelopus and Opisthocoelicaudia are classified outside the Camarasauridae. In 1993, Leonardo Salgado and Rodolfo Coria showed Opisthocoelicaudia to represent a titanosaur and classified it within the family Titanosauridae. The name Titanosauridae is currently considered invalid by many scientists; instead, the name Lithostrotia is often used as an equivalent. Within the Lithostrotia, Opisthocoelicaudia has been found to be closely related to the genera Alamosaurus, Neuquensaurus, Rocasaurus and Saltasaurus, together forming the family Saltasauridae. Interrelationships of these genera are contested. Many scientists considered Opisthocoelicaudia to be most closely related to Alamosaurus, with both genera forming a monophyletic group, the Opisthocoelicaudiinae. Other scientists concluded that the Opisthocoelicaudiinae is paraphyletic (not forming a natural group). Contradicting most other studies, Upchurch and colleagues in 2004 argued that Alamosaurus has to be placed outside the Saltasauridae as a close relative of Pellegrinisaurus, and therefore is not related to Opisthocoelicaudia at all. Skeletal drawing showing elements of the type specimen This cladogram, based on Calvo and colleagues (2007), shows a monophyletic Opisthocoelicaudiinae: Relationship to Nemegtosaurus Cast of the skull of Nemegtosaurus, a possible senior synonym, mounted on the Opisthocoelicaudia skeletal restoration in Warsaw Another sauropod of the Nemegt-Formation, Nemegtosaurus, is known only from a skull. Opisthocoelicaudia, on the other hand, lacks both the skull and neck, precluding a direct comparison and leading to suspicions that it may represent a synonym of Nemegtosaurus. According to the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature (ICZN), the oldest name has priority over younger synonymsif Opisthocoelicaudia would be shown to be a synonym of Nemegtosaurus, the name Nemegtosaurus would remain valid while Opisthocoelicaudia would become invalid. Both Opisthocoelicaudia and Nemegtosaurus were discovered during the 1965 joint Polish-Mongolian expedition. Before the remains were prepared and described, the expedition crew believed both finds to belong to the same species of sauropod. In 1977, Borsuk-Bia≈Çynicka deemed Opisthocoelicaudia and Nemegtosaurus to represent separate genera because Nemegtosaurus was at this time considered to be a member of the Dicraeosauridae, while Opisthocoelicaudia seemed to be a representative of a different group, the Camarasauridae. Currently, both Opisthocoelicaudia and Nemegtosaurus are classified within the Titanosauria, and Jeffrey Wilson stated in 2005 that synonymy cannot be ruled out. Currie and colleagues, in 2003 and 2017, argued that a synonymy is very probable in the light of new fossil discoveries in the Nemegt Formation. After relocating the original Nemegtosaurus quarry, these researchers excavated postcranial bones of the Nemegtosaurus holotype including the centrum of a caudal vertebra and hind limb bones, which allowed, for the first time, a direct comparison between the Nemegtosaurus and Opisthocoelicaudia type specimens based on overlapping elements. These postcranial elements were found to be very similar to the corresponding parts of the Opisthocoelicaudia holotype. Most importantly, the discovered caudal centrum is opisthocoelousa diagnostic feature of Opisthocoelicaudiasuggesting both genera were either closely related or synonymous. Furthermore, these authors noted that none of the 32 known sauropod localities of the Nemegt Formation revealed evidence for the presence of more than one species of sauropod. In 2019, Alexander O. Averianov and Alexey V. Lopatin reported Nemegt sauropod vertebrae discovered in 1949 and some femora that differed from the same bones of Opisthocoelicaudia, and stated they probably belonged to Nemegtosaurus, thereby supporting that the two genera were distinct. In her 1977 description, Borsuk-Bia≈Çynicka argued that different sauropod genera sharing the same habitat is nothing unusual, as is evident in the North American Morrison Formation. Currie and colleagues, however, stressed in 2018 that the dinosaur fauna of the Nemegt Formation was fundamentally different, as larger dinosaurs were present with only few species per clade, indicating a harsh and geographically restricted habitat. Definitive proof for the suggested synonymy is, however, still missing, and additional overlapping elements would be required before Opisthocoelicaudia and Nemegtosaurus can be formally declared synonyms. Paleobiology=Posture A: Posture based on the 1977 reconstruction by Borsuk-Bia≈Çynicka with a horizontal back. B: Posture based on the 2007 reconstruction by Schwarz et al. with a much steeper scapula (green) angled 60¬∞ towards the horizontal, resulting in a downwards tilting back. Originally, Borsuk-Bia≈Çynicka assumed that in standard position the neck was horizontal or slanted slightly downward. This was based on the reconstruction of the nuchal ligament, which runs atop of the cervical and dorsal vertebrae and serves to support the weight of the head and neck. Although an S-curved, swan-like ascending neck was envisaged in several subsequent reconstructions following similar depictions of better known sauropods, recent studies argue that sauropod necks were relatively straight and were carried more horizontally. The back was also reconstructed in a more or less horizontal orientation by Borsuk-Bia≈Çynicka, which was followed by most subsequent depictions. In a 2007 study, Daniela Schwarz and colleagues suggested that the back dipped towards the rear. According to these researchers, the shoulder blade would have been inclined at a horizontal angle of 55‚Äì65¬∞, much steeper than previously thought, resulting in an elevated shoulder region. With the vertebral column of the trunk and neck held in a relatively straight line, this would result in an elevated position of the head. Rearing stance Pelvis of the type specimen Opisthocoelicaudia may have been able to rear up on its hindlimbs for foraging, using its tail as a third leg. In 1977, Borsuk-Bia≈Çynicka cited several skeletal features that might have been related to rearing, including the opisthocoelous vertebrae of the anterior part of the tail, which, according to this author, would have made the tail more flexible than in other sauropods. Features of the pelvis, such as the thickened shelf of the acetabulum, the flaring ilia, and the fused pubic symphysis, may have allowed the pelvis to withstand the stress of rearing. Heinrich Mallison in 2011 argued that Opisthocoelicaudia may have been able to angle the anterior part of the tail against the posterior part, producing a buckle in midsection. Thus, the anterior part would have been more straight during rearing than in other sauropods. In 2005, Wilson assumed that rearing was an innovation not only of Opisthocoelicaudia but also of related genera within the subfamily Saltasaurinae. Common features of these genera, such as the shortened tail, may have evolved as adaptations to rearing. Footprints Natural cast of a sauropod hindfoot impression, probably left by Opisthocoelicaudia Footprints from the Nemegt Formation were unknown until 2003, when several examples had been described from the Nemegt locality by Currie and colleagues. Most of these footprints belonged to hadrosaurids (probably Saurolophus), while two have been left by a large theropod (probably Tarbosaurus) and yet another two by the hindfoot of a sauropod. The sauropod tracks were assigned to Opisthocoelicaudia, which, according to these authors, showed a matching hind foot morphology and was probably the only known sauropod (and, thus, the only potential trackmaker species) from the Nemegt Formation when Nemegtosaurus is regarded a synonym. The tracks were left in the soft and wet mud of shallow or freshly dried up points along a river and subsequently filled up with sand. Today only the sand infill remains, with the encasing mudstone having been eroded away. The best-preserved footprint measures across, so it was probably created by an individual larger than the type specimen. Although the surface of the underside is hard to obtain, the vertical surfaces are very well preserved, making this track one of the best preserved sauropod tracks known. Four digital impressions can be distinguished, with two or three showing claw impressions. The toes were almost perpendicular. Even a skin impression has been preserved above the impression of the first toe, which shows the non- overlapping scales, each with an average diameter of . The foot of the track creator was probably a little longer than wide. The second track is much shallower than the first, but shows well-preserved digit impressions with a high degree of detail, including at least two deep claw impressions that are rotated outwards, and a well-preserved impression of a fleshy toe pad behind the middle claw. Although number of additional sauropod tracks were reported in subsequent accounts, they continued to be rare in relation to the much more common hadrosaurid and theropod tracks. Brennan Stettner and colleagues, in 2017, reported on footprints discovered during a 2007 expedition to the Nemegt locality. The best preserved of these, a very large, long impression of a hindfoot, features a very well preserved underside showing digital pads and four outwards directed digits, the first three of which showing claws. Also in 2017, Judai Nakajima and colleagues described a kidney-shaped impression as the first sauropod manus (forefoot) impression discovered in the formation. Paleoecology Cretaceous-aged dinosaur fossil localities of Mongolia. Opisthocoelicaudia was collected in Altan Ula within areaA (left). The Nemegt Formation was deposited within the Late Cretaceous, although its exact age is unknown as it has never been dated radiometrically. According to different authors, the formation is late Campanian to early Maastrichtian, early Maastrichtian, or middle Maastrichtian in age. The sediments of the Nemegt Formation were deposited in a plain crossed by rivers. The climate was warm and subhumid with seasonal droughts, and the soils were relatively dry. Nevertheless, the Nemegt Formation was more humid than the underlying (and thus older) Barun Goyot and Djadochta Formations, which show a semiarid climate. The fauna of the Nemegt Formation includes aquatic or amphibious animals such as fish, turtles, and crocodiles as well as birds and the abundant medium to large sized dinosaurs, while smaller terrestrial vertebrates like lizards and mammals are rare. Theropod dinosaurs are very diverse in the Nemegt and include the abundant tyrannosaur Tarbosaurus, which might have preyed upon Opisthocoelicaudia. The only other known sauropod is Nemegtosaurus, which is known from a single skull. Ornithischians are represented by the \\"duck-billed\\" hadrosaurids (including the very common Saurolophus), the thick-skulled pachycephalosaurs, and the heavily armored ankylosaurs. Neoceratopsians are absent, despite being present in the older Barun Goyot and Djadochta formations. Other important dinosaur finds from the same locality as Opisthocoelicaudia include the troodontid Borogovia and the ankylosaur Tarchia.

At just under long, it is one of the shortest classified main rivers in the country. Course The river is first called Kyle after the confluence of Carle Beck and Derrings Beck. From the confluence it flows south-east of the village of Tholthorpe, near Easingwold, past Flawith, Alne and Tollerton. At Linton-on- Ouse it turns south and joins the River Ouse just north of Newton-on-Ouse. From source to mouth, the river extends to just in length. The Kyle is noted for its recurrent problems with pollution caused by agricultural effluent. In 1978, the water from the river became polluted after a barn fire had been extinguished and the water used to douse the fire had found its way into the River Kyle. Some of the pollution was a paraquat based weedkiller which is lethal in high concentrations and for which there is no antidote. As the City of York took its water supply from the River Ouse, they had to close their river intakes for two weeks to allow the polluted water to be flushed downriver. History The river previously formed the boundary of the Forest of Galtres. During the Second World War, RAF Bomber Command operated an airfield near the start of the River Kyle at RAF Tholthorpe. Both the Royal Air Force and the Royal Canadian Air Force flew from this base until its closure in 1945.RAF Bomber Command, story of Tholthorpe airfield The river also passes close to the current airfield at RAF Linton-on-Ouse, which was originally opened in 1937 as part of RAF Bomber Command.

The club are currently members of the and groundshare with Ilford at the Cricklefield Stadium. History The club was established in 1898 and joined the Ilford League.History Of Barkingside FC Barkingside F.C. They won the league (jointly) after World War I, but folded due to a lack of support during the 1922‚Äì23 season. In 1925 the club was reformed as Barkingside Boys Guild, and initially played in the Ilford Minor League. They were soon renamed Barkingside Old Boys, before becoming simply Barkingside in the 1930s. After World War II the club joined the South Essex League, finishing runners-up in their first season. The following season they switched to the Walthamstow League, also joining the Amateur Football Alliance. In 1950 they joined Division Two of the London League, and after finishing as runners- up in their first season, were promoted to Division One. The club won the Ilford Festival Cup and the Romford Charity Cup in 1952, and the London League Cup in 1956. The league was reduced to a single division in 1956, and when it gained another division in 1963, Barkingside were placed in the Premier Division. At the end of the season the league merged with the Aetolian League to form the Greater London League. The league had two sections, A and B, with Barkingside in the former. After finishing tenth in the 1964‚Äì65 season, they were placed in Division One for the following season.Greater London League 1964-1971 Non-League Matters The following season saw them finish second in Division One, earning promotion to the Premier Division. However, they were relegated in 1966‚Äì67 after finishing second-bottom of the division. The league was reduced to a single division for the 1969‚Äì70 season, but the following season saw it enlarged to three divisions, with Barkingside placed in Premier Division Section A. In 1971 the Greater London League merged with the Metropolitan League to form the Metropolitan‚ÄìLondon League, with Barkingside in Division Two. They remained in Division Two until the league was reduced to a single division in 1974, and at the end of the 1974‚Äì75, another league merger occurred, with the Metropolitan‚ÄìLondon League merging with the Spartan League to form the London Spartan League; Barkingside were placed in Division Two of the new league.Spartan League 1955-1983 Non-League Matters After finishing fourth in 1976‚Äì77, they were promoted to the (renamed) Premier Division. However, the following season saw them finish bottom of the Premier Division, resulting in relegation back to the Senior Division. They remained in the Senior Division until the end of the 1985‚Äì86 season, when a fifth-place finish saw them promoted to the Premier Division.Spartan League 1983-1997 Non- League Matters In 1987 the league was renamed the Spartan League. The 1996‚Äì97 season saw Barkingside win the last-ever Spartan League title, as the league merged with the South Midlands League at the end of the season to form the Spartan South Midlands League. Barkingside were placed in the Premier Division South for the first season, and after finishing third, became members of the Premier Division for the following season, which saw them win the title. However, the club were denied promotion to the Isthmian League, and instead requested a transfer to the Essex Senior League. As a result of the FA ruling that sideways moves were not allowed within the pyramid, the club withdrew from senior football for one season and joined the Essex Senior League for the 2000‚Äì01 season. Their first season in the new league saw them win the Gordon Brastead Memorial Cup, and they went on to win the League Cup in 2008‚Äì09 and 2012‚Äì13. The latter season also saw them finish as runners-up, earning promotion to Division One North of the Isthmian League. However, after three seasons in which they finished in the bottom five on every occasion, they were relegated back to the Essex Senior League at the end of the 2015‚Äì16 season. The 2018‚Äì19 season saw Barkingside finish second-from-bottom of the Essex Senior League, resulting in relegation to Division One South of the Eastern Counties League. Ground The club initially played at a ground on Barkingside High Road opposite the State Cinema. They later played at Barkingside Recreation Ground, and after 25 years, moved to Station Road, located next to Barkingside tube station. Groundworks began in 1956 and involved removing World War II-era tank traps from the site.Jon Weaver (2006) The Football Grounds of Essex Metropolitan, pp9‚Äì11 Banking was created on three sides, with plans to install terracing; the other side was to feature a 600-seat grandstand, giving the ground a capacity of 10,000. However, these plans never came to fruition and only a lean-to stand with a capacity of 100 was built. The ground was opened on 24 August 1957 with a London League match against Cray Wanderers. A fire in the early 1970s forced the club to play its home fixtures at Woodford Avenue until the clubhouse was rebuilt and they could return to Station Road. A new stand was built in place of the lean-to in the late 1970s and floodlights were installed in 1989. A 250-seat stand was built on one side of the pitch, but was removed due to a lack of planning permissions. Prior to the start of the 1998‚Äì99 season the club came under the control of new owners and work then commenced on the ground, which was renamed Oakside Stadium, to bring it up to Isthmian League standard. During the 2001‚Äì02 season the lease at Oakside was sold on to Ford United, who needed to find a permanent home to allow their progression up the football pyramid. In 2014 the club left Oakside after being told their rent would be increased, and began groundsharing at Ilford's Cricklefield Stadium.No grudges as Barkingside to leave Oakside Ilford Recorder, 20 March 2014 Honours *Spartan South Midlands League **Champions 1998‚Äì99 *Spartan League **Premier Division champions 1996‚Äì97 *London League **League Cup winners 1955‚Äì56 *London Senior Cup **Winners 1996‚Äì97 *Essex Senior League **Gordon Brastead Memorial Cup winners 2000‚Äì01 **League Cup winners 2008‚Äì09, 2012‚Äì13 *Ilford Festival Cup ** Winners 1951‚Äì52Barkingside: The football historian on a mission to find Festival of Britain heroes Enfield Independent, 2 September 2011 *Harry Sunderland Shield **Winners 1983‚Äì84 Records *Best FA Cup performance: Second qualifying round, 1998‚Äì99, 2007‚Äì08 *Best FA Trophy performance: Second qualifying round, 2014‚Äì15 *Best FA Vase performance: Third round, 1990‚Äì91, 1998‚Äì99 *Record attendance: 957 vs Arsenal reserves, London League, 1957Mike Williams & Tony Williams (2012) Non-League Club Directory 2013, p656 See also *Barkingside F.C. players ReferencesExternal links *Official website Category:Football clubs in England Category:Sport in the London Borough of Redbridge Category:Association football clubs established in 1889 Category:1889 establishments in England Category:Football clubs in London Category:London League (football) Category:Greater London League Category:Metropolitan‚ÄìLondon League Category:Spartan League Category:Spartan South Midlands Football League Category:Essex Senior Football League Category:Isthmian League Category:Eastern Counties Football League ","title":"Barkingside F.C."},{"id":"3549008","text":"Vissim may refer to: * VisSim, a visual block diagram language for model based simulation and embedded development.

Two species are known: O. makelai and O. minimus (possibly Laosaurus). Discovery and naming Size of known individuals of Orodromeus (left) compared to its relatives Thescelosaurus (right) and Parksosaurus (center), as well as a human The remains of Orodromeus were discovered by Robert Makela during the excavation in Teton County, Montana, of the Egg Mountain brooding colony of a much larger relative, Maiasaura. The type species, Orodromeus makelai, was named and shortly described by Jack Horner and David B. Weishampel in 1988. The generic name is derived from Greek ·ΩÑœÅŒøœÇ, oros, \\"mountain\\", in reference to the Egg Mountain site, and Œ¥œÅŒøŒºŒµœçœÇ, dromeus, \\"runner\\", referring to the cursorial habits of the animal. The specific name honoured the late Makela.Horner, J. and Weishampel, D., 1988, \\"A comparative embryological study of two ornithischian dinosaurs\\", Nature (London), 332(No. 6161): 256-257 (1988) The holotype specimen, MOR 294, was found in a layer of the Two Medicine Formation, dating from the Campanian stage, about 75 million years ago. It consists of a partial skeleton with skull. The paratypes are MOR 246, a clutch of nineteen eggs, some with embryo; PP 22412, a set of hindlimbs; MOR 331, a partial skeleton; MOR 248, a skeleton with skull; and MOR 403, a braincase. A full published description is still lacking, though an unpublished thesis on Orodromeus exists.Scheetz, R.D., 1999, Osteology of Orodromeus makelai and the phylogeny of basal ornithopod dinosaurs D. Ph. Thesis in Biology, Montana State University, Bozeman, 189 pp However, MOR 246 and other eggs from Egg Mountain are now considered to belong to a troodontid which may be Stenonychosaurus. In 1990, the species Laosaurus minimus, described by Charles Gilmore in 1909 based on NMC 9438, a partial left hindlimb and pieces of vertebra from the Allison Formation in Alberta, was noted as the second species of Orodromeus. The fragmentary nature of the remains, however, makes it difficult to assign the specimen with certainty. Description Orodromeus was a small fast bipedal herbivore that probably coexisted with dinosaurs such as Daspletosaurus and Einiosaurus. Its length was estimated by Horner & Weishampel at 2.5 metres. Orodromeus is distinguished by a palpebral that is at its back attached to the postorbital; a boss on the jugal; a non-fused wrist; and triangular maxillary and dentary teeth with a vertical occlusion. Phylogeny Model nest and hatchlings of Orodromeus makelai Orodromeus was by Horner & Weishampel assigned to the Hypsilophodontidae, as the youngest known member. Today these are seen as an unnatural, paraphyletic, group, and Orodromeus is simply considered to be a basal member of the Euornithopoda. Brown et al. (2013) put it in the family Thescelosauridae and named a new subfamily (Orodrominae) after it. Palaeobiology Because of the advanced development of the bones and teeth of the embryos, Horner concluded that the young of Orodromeus were precocial. It has been speculated that this animal may have burrowed much like its relative Oryctodromeus, based upon the packing of their bones in situations where they typically would have been scattered. Mallon et al. (2013) examined herbivore coexistence on the island continent of Laramidia, during the Late Cretaceous. It was concluded that small ornithischians like Orodromeus were generally restricted to feeding on vegetation at, or below the height of 1 meter.

It is not an article about the town of Letterkenny in Ireland. Letterkenny Army Depot (originally Letterkenny Ordnance Depot), the Center of Industrial and Technical Excellence (CITE) for Air Defense and Tactical Missile Systems, was established in 1942. The Depot is under the command structure of the U.S. Army Aviation and Missile Command (AMCOM). The facilities at Letterkenny are used to conduct maintenance, modification, storage, and demilitarization operations on tactical missiles and ammunition. Located primarily in Letterkenny Township and extending into Greene Township and Hamilton Township, all in Franklin County, Pennsylvania, just northwest of the borough of Chambersburg, the Depot consists of nearly 18,000 acres (71 km¬≤). It is the largest employer in Franklin County, Pennsylvania, and adds over one-quarter of a billion dollars annually to the region's economy. Letterkenny has unique tactical missile repair capabilities repairing a variety of Department of Defense (DoD) missile systems, including the MIM-104 PATRIOT missile and its ground support and radar equipment. More recently, Letterkenny expanded its product line to include designation of the CITE for Power Generation for the Army, the overhaul of tactical wheeled vehicles (HMMWVs), material handling equipment (7.5-ton cranes), and Mobile Kitchen Trailers. In 2007, during the Iraq conflict, Letterkenny began building new Mine Resistant Ambush Protected (MRAP) armored vehicles in partnership with BAE Systems, and in 2010 was designated the Joint Depot Source of Repair (JDSOR) for Route Clearance Vehicles for the DoD. History= 1940s ‚àí 1960s  In 1941, Letterkenny was chosen by the U.S. Department of War to be one of twelve new ordnance depots. On December 18, 1941, the Secretary of War, Henry L. Stimson, issued the directive to acquire 21,000 acres (85 km¬≤) at Letterkenny for a depot. The mission would be to reduce the surplus of forthcoming material and to store and ship ammunition, trucks, parts, and other supplies. In 1942, the government obtained the James Finley House for use as the Commanding Officer's Residence, making it one of the largest depots of its kind. Note: This includes The first shipment of ammunition arrived by train in late 1942, and more than three million tons of supplies were moved during World War II. After the war, an enormous amount of ammunition was returned from overseas, some of which was unserviceable and had to be destroyed. During the Korean War, with improved capabilities, Letterkenny took on the task and shifted to a wartime pace, increasing their workforce to 6,500 by adding as many as 50 new employees each day during their growth's peak. With new technologies in electronics and guided missile maintenance in the 1950s, the Depot saw a further increased workload. Newly trained employees began working on Project Nike missile components in 1953. On July 1, 1954, Letterkenny Ordnance Depot became a permanent military installation. It was renamed Letterkenny Army Depot in August 1962 under the U.S. Army Materiel Command (AMC), and with the war in Vietnam, Letterkenny's missions again increased with greater materiel being funneled through the Depot. Its maintenance division became one of the largest activities, with 1,400 workers reconditioning artillery, combat vehicles, and guided missiles. Automation was also introduced at this time along with the update of several facilities. Soon after, in 1964, the 28th Ordnance Detachment moved from Fort Meade, Maryland, to Letterkenny, adding to their capabilities the disposal of explosive ordnance items including bombs, shells, rockets, and guided missiles. They also assisted police in the disposal of explosives and war souvenirs.  1970s ‚àí 1990s  In the 1970s, command of Savanna Army Depot Activity, Illinois, fell under Letterkenny, and the U.S. Army Depot System Command (DESCOM) was established and headquartered there. DESCOM, a two-star command and major subordinate element of AMC, remained at the Depot until 1995. In 1974, Letterkenny's capabilities further expanded to include maintenance for the Air Tow Missile as well as long-term storage of war reserve stock packaged petroleum, oil and lubricants, and various chemicals and acids. By the late 1970s, the Depot was one of five installations in the United States to activate the Automated Multi-Media Exchange (AMME), leading to more effective communication service. Letterkenny was at that point the largest installation in Pennsylvania, with more than 5,400 workers. During the 1980s and early 1990s, the Depot further evolved with the construction of new facilities and the establishment of modernization projects. Its mission was then threefold: supply, maintenance, and ammunition. The Depot's efforts with the Paladin (M109 howitzer), PATRIOT, and HAWK led to Letterkenny's designation as a Center for Technical Excellence. Their capabilities were again expanded, this time to include the AIM-7 Sparrow and the improved AIM-9 Sidewinder. With the downsizing, reorganization, and realignments of the DoD and the consolidation of tactical missile, Letterkenny was selected in 1990 to serve as the sole processing and storage location for all weapons captured during that year's invasion of Panama in Operation Just Cause. Two years later, the Depot was selected to be the center of all Tactical Missile Systems in the Army, Navy, Air Force and Marines. This involved support components from 21 new missile systems. Letterkenny's efforts for this mission gained it the reputation as \\"the well renowned depot for air defense and missile maintenance\\". That same year, the Depot's supply mission was relocated to New Cumberland, Pennsylvania under the Defense Logistics Agency; however, by 2001, a smaller Directorate of Supply and Transportation was reestablished at Letterkenny. In 1994, Letterkenny partnered with United Defense, Limited Partnership (UDLP) to produce the Paladin and completed 950 within five years. Following the Cold War, the U.S. government established the 1995 Base Realignment and Closure Commission (BRAC), which relocated Letterkenny's artillery mission to Anniston Army Depot. BRAC also ordered nearly 1,500 acres to be returned to the community. As of 2014, five of seven land transfer phases with seven-eighths of the acreage have been completed. In late 1999, the Depot transitioned from U.S. Army Industrial Operations Command (IOC) to U.S. Army Aviation and Missile Command.  2000s  In 2001, Letterkenny was recognized as the Center of Industrial and Technical Excellence (CITE) for Air Defense and Tactical Missile Ground Support Equipment, and the CITE for Mobile Electric Power Generation Equipment in 2005. Following the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, Letterkenny supported the Global War on Terrorism by retrofitting Ground Mobility Vehicles (GMVs), resetting AN/TWQ-1 Avengers and High-Mobility Multipurpose Wheeled Vehicles (HMMWVs), and recapping PATRIOT Missiles.\\" Using Lean manufacturing concepts, Letterkenny transformed its 318,000 sq.ft. vehicle building into a flexible manufacturing floor. Each work bay was fitted with identical capabilities in order to meet the challenges of chemical and biological threats. Soon after, the Depot began private sector partnerships to \\"collaboratively share advantageous skill sets and unique capabilities.\\" In 2005, Letterkenny was recognized with the silver Shingo Prize for Excellence in Manufacturing for the PATRIOT Missile Launcher. This prize, which was the first for an Army depot, led to the first of eight Shingo awards the Depot would receive. Others were awarded based on work in areas including: \\"HMMWVs, Generators, Biological Integrated Detection Systems (BIDS), PATRIOT Systems, and Aviation Ground Power Units (AGPU).\\" That same year, BRAC named Letterkenny as First in Military Value for Tactical Wheeled Vehicles. Efforts during the 2000s focused largely on the following: cranes, generators, HMMWVs, the PATRIOT Recapitalization program, medium mine protected vehicles (MMPV), and mine resistant ambush protected (MRAP) systems.  2010s  The Theater Readiness Maintenance Directorate, in partnership with private industry, produced the first missile at the newly constructed Theater Readiness Maintenance Facility. Lockheed Martin and Precision Fires Rocket and Missile System (PFRMS) partnered with LEAD to enhance High Mobility Artillery Rocket System (HIMARS) production. This included the Special Test Equipment, Special Tooling, tools, training, testing and, ultimately, LEAD's demonstration of capabilities required to repair various M270A1 and HIMARS Fire Control System and HIMARS launcher components. The production of Route Clearance Vehicles (RCV) emerged as a primary focus of the Depot's workload. LEAD, in 2010, was named the Joint Depot Source of Repair Decision on the RCV. The Services jointly agreed that Depot Maintenance will be accomplished organically for the RCV: Buffalo/MPCV, Vehicle Mounted Mine Detection System (VMMD) also known as the \\"Husky,\\" RG-31 Medium Mine -Protected Vehicle (MMPV), Joint EOD Rapid Response Vehicle (JERRV) and Medium Mine-Protected Vehicle (MMPV) Panther at LEAD. In December 2010, Letterkenny completed the last of over 20,000 recapped HMMWVs. With the program completed, LEAD converted its primary assembly line of HMMWVs to accommodate Reset of PATRIOT Prime Movers. with a workload encompassing s, Trailers, Heavy Expanded Mobility Tactical Trucks (HEMTT's), 900 Series 5 Ton Trucks, Family of Medium Tactical Vehicles (FMTV) and 860 Trailers. In 2012 Letterkenny was recognized as a CITE for RCV and PATRIOT Missile Recertification. The First Article Testing for the New Build AGPU was completed in February 2012. Explosion On 19 July 2018 four servicemen were injured when an explosion occurred at the depot. Environmental contamination In the 1960s, environmental hazards became a concern. Air pollution abatement began in 1969 and all coal burning heating systems had been converted to fuel oil by 1972. In 1983, the groundwater beneath the Letterkenny Army Depot's southeast area was found to be contaminated with volatile organic compounds (VOC). In 1984, at least six major areas of VOC contamination and/or elevated levels of metals were found, particularly three industrial waste lagoons which had contributed to the contamination to the groundwater. The contaminated groundwater plume migrated off-site and discharged to springs up to two miles to the east and south downstream and to off-post water wells. The Army supplied residents with bottled water after residential well sampling showed the presence of VOC. On October 15, 1984, the site was proposed to the National Priorities List of the most serious uncontrolled or abandoned hazardous waste sites requiring long term clean up, and it was added to the list on July 22, 1987. That year, 38 residences and businesses were connected to the local water supply, and in 1992 three additional residences were added. In 1989, following an agreement with the United States Environmental Protection Agency and the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection, the Depot installed a \\"pump and treat\\" system which remains in use to treat contaminated groundwater in the installation's northeast industrial area. Much of the pollution is from degreasers stored or disposed of in landfills, trenches, burn pits, or spilled from storage during the 1950s and 1960s, including chlorinated organic solvents, blast media, paints, petroleum products, metals, and cleaning agents. The Depot was recognized by the Secretary of the Army for Environmental Restoration in 2002, Environmental Quality in 2006, and Environmental Sustainability in 2009. Environmental cleanup, for which the Army has spent about $30 million as of 2014, has slowed the return of the land ordered by BRAC in 1995. Letterkenny has a Restoration Advisory Board of government and community representatives which meets to discuss clean up and future property transfer.

It is housed in a Grade-I heritage building, the old Dairy farm cold storage depot, built circa 1892 in a late Victorian eclectic style. The facade of this building is distinguished by its \\"blood and bandages\\" brickwork. Premises In 1892, Dairy Farm built a low- rise brick and stucco building on Lower Albert Road in Central for use as a cold storage warehouse. This warehouse was later renovated and expanded in 1913 to include a dairy shop, a room for meat smoking, a cold storage room for winter clothes and residency for the general manager. The building later evolved into the company headquarters until the company moved in the 1970s. The abandoned building was acquired by the Hong Kong Fringe Club in 1984. The building has undergone many major renovations to make it a vibrant place for contemporary arts since the Fringe Club moved in, in 1983. In 2001, the building won a Hong Kong Government Heritage Award for its use of the building.Winning Entries of Hong Kong Heritage Awards (2001) It has been categorised as a Grade I historic building.List of Graded Historic Buildings in Hong Kong (as at 7 Nov 2008) Arts venues The Fringe Club has two studio theatres, three exhibition areas (including a photography gallery), a rehearsal room, a restaurant, a roof garden and offices.

It is now a public park on the Waterfront Trail. It was recognized as a Historic Place in 1978.Adamson Estate , Canadian Register of Historic Places  History  The land on which the property is built was acquired by Joseph Cawthra in 1809. The farmland, which came to be known as the Grove Farm, was granted to Agar Adamson and Mabel Cawthra as a wedding gift. Agar Adamson, born on Christmas Day 1865, was the grandson of William Agar Adamson an influential Toronto clergyman. He married into the Cawthra family whose legacy in Peel lives on through the Cawthra Estate located near the intersection of the Cawthra Road and the Queen Elizabeth Way. Their legacy comes from supplying eastern white pine logs for ship masts in the British Royal Navy.Tapestry of War: A Private View of Canadians in the Great War (1992)Harper Collins by Sandra Gwyn. He served under General Arthur Currie. Insights into his time at war may be seen in the CBC series The Great War which features Talbot Papineau, another of the four Canadians featured in the book. Agar Adamson designed and built the Belgian- style mansion on this land in 1919, after returning from the wartime service in France. In 1943, his son Anthony Adamson added a home for himself on the property. The estate was acquired by the Credit Valley Conservation Authority in 1975.  Architecture  The architecture of the main house, often thought to be Spanish is actually Flemish architecture, one of the areas in the European theatre in which Agar fought during the First World War. One of the treasures of the Adamson Estate are the great eastern white pine, the provincial tree of Ontario, which remain on the site and are ties to the heritage of the Adamson/Cawthra families and that of the early development of Toronto Township, Peel County, now known largely as Mississauga, Region of Peel. Another element of interest is the family pet cemetery which has been recently surrounded by a wrought iron fence with stone pillars and memorial plaque.

It most frequently happens in order to qualify for a lower weight class (usually in combat sports or rowing, where weight is a significant advantage) or in sports where it is advantageous to weigh as little as possible (most notably equestrian sports). There are two types of weight cutting: one method is to lose weight in the form of fat and muscle in the weeks prior to an event; the other is to lose weight in the form of water in the final days before competition. Common methods to cut weight include restricting food intake, water-loading, and perspiration through exercise, wearing a sweatsuit, and/or sitting in a saunahttps://jissn.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12970-019-0320-9. Nutritional experts rarely give advice on how to cut weight safely or effectively, and recommend against cutting weight. However, many athletes choose to do it because they wish to gain an advantage in their sport.  Dieting  In addition to improving performance through healthy eating, some athletes will seek to lose weight through dieting and aerobic exercise. By losing fat they hope to achieve a higher \\"strength-to-mass ratio\\" or \\"lean weight.\\" This means more muscle and less fat, and should theoretically give them an advantage against other athletes of the same weight.

Functions In order to promote more informed science in the media, the centre's main function is as a service to journalists, providing background briefings on current scientific issues and facilitating interviews with scientists. Its director is Fiona Fox who is a former member of the Revolutionary Communist Party and a former contributor to its magazine Living Marxism. Aims The SMC's stated aim is to \\"facilitate more scientists to engage with the media, in the hope that the public will have improved access to accurate, evidence-based scientific information about the stories of the day\\". Structure The setting up of the Science Media Centre was assisted by Susan Greenfield, the director of the Royal Institution of Great Britain. While the centre is still based in a specially refurbished wing of the Royal Institution, full independence is claimed from all funders and supporters.{{cn} The Science Media Centre is funded by over 60 organisations, with individual donations capped at ¬£12,500 per annum.{{cn} The SMC receives sponsorship from a range of funders including media organisations, universities, scientific and learned societies, the UK Research Councils, government bodies, Quangos, charities, private donors and corporate bodies.

Their almost-entirely-improvised album In A Different City was recorded in Chicago during this time, and later released in 1999. In a unique twist, the band had an audience paint vinyl LP covers while they performed, which were later collected as \\"painticons\\" and distributed as the actual album covers for the LP version of the album. The Orange Tapered Moon EP followed in 2000, recorded during a late night marathon session at WFMU. The LP covers were again created in the same way the In a Different City covers were. In 2001, the band released A Flat Inside A Fog, The Cat That Was A Dog, another ambitious project. The band split following this release, with McDonnell studying in China and starting the Michael Columbia project with drummer Dylan Ryan, Barnes going to France to work on other projects, and Rodriguez working on his Icy Demons project.

In 1980‚Äì81 the club won the league, and the following season saw them win the League Challenge Cup.Honours Bowers & Pitsea F.C. They won the Harry Fisher Trophy in 1991‚Äì92, before going on to win the league and challenge cup double in 1998‚Äì99. In 2004 Bowers United absorbed Pitsea Football Club, adopting their current name. Pitsea had played in the Vange & District Sunday League and the Basildon Sunday League, winning the league treble in 1994‚Äì95 and 1995‚Äì96, and the league and cup double in 1996‚Äì97. In 2014‚Äì15 the club won the Challenge Cup for a third time. The following season saw them win the league, earning promotion to Division One North of the Isthmian League. They also reached the semi-finals of the FA Vase, losing 4‚Äì3 on aggregate to eventual winners Morpeth Town. The 2017‚Äì18 season saw Bowers & Pitsea finish third in the renamed North Division, qualifying for the promotion play-offs. However, they were beaten 2‚Äì0 by Canvey Island in the semi-finals. The following season the club were North Division champions, earning promotion to the Premier Division. Ground The club were originally based at what later became Pitsea Market, before moving to Gun Meadow. When the A13 was built, the Gun Meadow ground was subject to a compulsory purchase order, resulting in the club moving to its current home on Crown Avenue. The site was purchased from the Basildon Development Corporation, as well as a prefabricated building that became the club's dressing rooms.Jon Weaver (2005) The Football Grounds of Rural Essex, p7 It was officially opened with a friendly match against Ex-Tottenham Hotspur All-Star team. A seated stand was built on one side of the pitch, with the original bench seating later replaced with red tip-up seats. A covered standing area was erected next to the seated stand.

The national park has an area of , and the surrounding nature reserve , making the total protected area about . It has been protected to preserve its noted natural values, e.g. one of the largest sections of untouched forest in southern Sweden, and to safeguard its importance for recreation.

The park also has deciduous broadleaf forests, open arable land and historical buildings of cultural interest. A typical feature of primeval forest is the great number of plant and animal species. Up to 8,000 species of animals can be found here which is four times as many as in managed forests. Many species are also completely dependent on primeval forest as their habitats and can not survive under other conditions.

The industry was associated with the maintenance of the wooden ships and sailing tackle of pre-20th century navies, which were caulked and waterproofed using the pitch (or resin, also known as tar) of the pine tree.Earley, p. 87 History Herty system in use on turpentine trees in northern Florida, circa 1936 Herty turpentine cup, made of clay. The hole is for nailing to a pine tree. Turpentine cup made of tin, was attached to a pine tree. With the demise of wooden ships, those uses of pine resin ended, but the industry remained vigorous as new products created new markets. First extensively described by Frederick Law Olmsted in his book A Journey in the Seaboard Slave States (1856),Olmsted, Ch. 5, pp. 110-173 the naval stores industry was one of the economic mainstays of the southeastern United States until the late 20th century. Despite a rapid decline of the gum naval stores industry in the last quarter of the 20th century, a few places in the southeastern United States still rely on it as a major part of their livelihood.Outland, p. 5 Gum naval stores cultivation refers to the labor- intensive method of extracting pine resin from the trees (the raw gum). The method of collection‚Äîtapping the trees‚Äîvaguely resembles that used on a rubber plantation or in a maple sugar grove. However, instead of preparing the tree to receive a pipe or tap, the tree is gashed with an inch-wide curved blade, called a \\"hack,\\" to remove all of the bark down through the cambium layer. An angled piece of galvanized tin is then placed below the eight-inch-long, one- inch-wide gash (also known as \\"the streak\\") to direct the oozing sap into a quart-sized rectangular cup fixed to the tree. Each new \\"streak\\" is put onto the tree above the preceding one, and gradually a vertical \\"cat face\\" more than thirty inches in height is formed. Through the mid-twentieth century, a \\"puller,\\" a type of hack that had a long handle, was used to extend the streak up the tree to a height of more than seven feet. Once, large operators, known as \\"factors,\\" controlled huge tracts of forests, some in the hundreds of thousands of acres, which they leased to \\"operators,\\" and also advanced them capital, usually in the form of tools and other equipment and goods with which to operate. The operators satisfied their debt to the factors by returning the produce, barrels of resin. The name \\"Factors Walk\\" on the riverfront in Savannah, Georgia, commemorates an area on the Savannah River harbor where thousands of barrels of produce were collected for transshipment. Between 1880 and 1920, Savannah was the largest port for naval stores products and continued to set the world price of naval stores until 1950.Outland, pp. 56-57; 147-150; 295Earley, pp. 136-137 Basic processes The basic raw material, pine resin, once collected, is converted into two major products ‚Äî rosin and turpentine. For many years rosin and turpentine were used unprocessed in common household products such as soap, paper, paint, and varnish. Today most rosin is altered to be used in a wide range of products that includes paper sizing, surface coatings, adhesives, printing inks, and rubber compounds. Turpentine, like rosin, has become a versatile material exploited to develop uses in fragrances, flavors, vitamins, household cleaning products, medicines, and polyterpene resin. Industry today Because of a shortage of workers willing to perform the heavy manual labor involved in the streaking of many acres of trees and in collecting the resin tree by tree as well, the gum naval stores industry entered a period of steep decline beginning in the 1960s. As of 2001, only one large-scale facility (begun as Filtered Rosin Products) in Baxley, Georgia, continued in operation, serving the remaining naval stores producers in the surrounding area. Gradually, the method of tapping trees to obtain naval stores products has become overshadowed by industries which yield these products as byproducts of other operations.Outland, pp. 300-307 See also * McCranie's Turpentine Still * Non-timber forest product  References  ;Notes ;Bibliography * Earley, Lawrence S.

The fundamental concept was to create a large repository of professional level medical content that could be both updated and accessed continuously to assist in clinical care and physician education. The eMedicine website consists of approximately 6,800 medical topic review articles, each of which is associated with one of 62 clinical subspecialty \\"textbooks\\". Pediatrics, for example, has 1,050 articles organized into 14 subspecialty \\"textbooks\\" (Pediatric endocrinology, genetics, cardiology, pulmonology, etc.); the emergency medicine volume has 630 articles and internal medicine has nearly 1,400 articles. If the remainder of the specialty textbooks (e.g., Neurology, Orthopedics, Ophthalmology, etc.) are added to the total 6800+ articles were created in eMedicine. In addition, the knowledge base includes over 25,000 clinically multimedia files (e.g., photographs, imaging studies, audio files, video files). To create this online content over 11,000 board certified healthcare specialists (95%+ physicians, 95%+ US based) were recruited and managed in a first generation, proprietary learning management system (LMS). To provide some perspective on the amount of content that was created it is estimated that, if hard-copy printed out, it would total over 1 million pages. Each article is authored by board certified specialists in the subspecialty to which the article belongs and undergoes three levels of physician peer-review, plus review by a Doctor of Pharmacy. The article's authors are identified with their current faculty appointments. Each article is updated yearly, or more frequently as changes in practice occur, and the date is published on the article. eMedicine.com was sold to WebMD in January, 2006 and is available as the Medscape Reference. History Dr. Plantz, Dr. Adler and Mr. Berezin evolved the concept for eMedicine.com in 1996 and deployed the initial site via Boston Medical Publishing, Inc., a corporation in which Plantz and Adler were principals. Over a period of 1.5 years the Group Publishing System 1 (GPS 1) was developed that allowed large numbers of contributors to collaborate simultaneously. That system was first used to create a knowledge base in Emergency Medicine with 600 contributing MDs creating over 630 chapters in just over a year. In 1997 eMedicine.com, Inc. was legally spun off from Boston Medical Publishing. With growing traction as a revolutionary online healthcare publishing company eMedicine attracted angel level investment from Tenet Healthcare in 1999 and a significant VC investment in 2000 (Omnicom Group, HIG Capital). All investor companies held seats on the eMedicine Board of Directors. Several key individuals made early investments in the company. These Co-Founders included Richard Lavely, MD JD who led recruitment and execution for the Internal Medicine volume and Julie Bohlen MBA who ran editorial operations for many years and became a board member. Later Ms. Bohlen, along with the other founders, played a key role in developing eMedicine Health the 600+ article consumer health reference. In 1997 the decision was also made to broaden the scope of eMedicine to effectively all medical and surgical specialties and eventually the aforementioned eMedicine Health initiative. With this gigantic expansion Co-Founders Nicholas Lorenzo MD MHCM CPE DABPN and Anne Bueltel Lorenzo BS invested in and joined the company. Ms. Bueltel Lorenzo ran production operations for many years and with Dr. Lorenzo was stationed in the Omaha eMedicine office. Dr. Lorenzo held multiple senior executive roles in the company including Chief Publishing Officer, was a member of the Board of Directors, Project Editor-in-Chief, Senior Vice President, and was the Founding Editor-in-Chief of eMedicine Neurology. Several years were spent creating the tables of contents, recruiting expert physicians and in the creation of the additional 6,100+ medical and surgical articles. The majority of operations were based out of the Omaha NE office. However, eMedicine was one of the world's first virtual companies with key staff in multiple offices around the country including Omaha NE (Publishing and later corporate office), St. Petersburg FL (original corporate office), Syracuse NY (technology office), and Boston MA. With increasing web traffic and notoriety eMedicine developed a multi-product sales and marketing strategy. Pharmaceutical sponsorship sales were led by Laz Cabanas BS, Senior Vice President, and healthcare institutional sales were led by Dennis Carson MBA, Senior Vice President. Revenue increased exponentially as a result of the completion of the professional level content, innovative sales and marketing strategies (e.g., Laz Cabanas popular web sponsored microsite strategy), and development of the second generation LMS known as GPS 2. In the early 2000s Drs. Plantz and Lorenzo also spearheaded an alliance with the University of Nebraska Medical Center to accredit eMedicine content for physician, nursing, and pharmacy continuing education. eMedicine also obtained accreditation for optometry and to a lesser extent physical therapy continuing education accreditation. These continuing education accreditations increased eMedicine's visibility and credibility in the healthcare industry and also enhanced revenue generation. eMedicine was also the recipient of dozens of healthcare professional, healthcare consumer, and internet quality awards during this time. Over the ensuing several years, eMedicine.com and eMedicineHealth.com became widely trafficked and revenues increased markedly. In 2005, eMedicine entered into discussions for acquisition. The board of directors at the time of sale, consisting of Jonathan Adler, Jeffrey Berezin, Craig Burson, Lilian Shackelford Murray and Michael P. Tierney, unanimously recommended approval for sale of the company to WebMD. The sale was completed in January 2006 and the content is available via WebMD's Medscape site and has since been renamed the Medscape Reference. Content now includes allergy and immunology, cardiology, clinical procedures, critical care, dermatology, emergency medicine, endocrinology, gastroenterology. genomic medicine, hematology, infectious diseases, nephrology, neurology, obstetrics/gynecology, oncology, pathology, perioperative care, physical medicine and rehabilitation, psychiatry, pulmonology, radiology, rheumatology, and sports medicine. Surgical subspecialties include neurosurgery, ophthalmology, orthopedic surgery, (ENT) and facial plastic surgery, plastic surgery, thoracic surgery, transplantation, Trauma, urology, and vascular surgery. The site is free to use, requiring only registration. More than 11,000 physician contributors from primarily in the US but also internationally participated in the creation of the articles. Novel at the time, eMedicine content could also be accessed as an e-book, and could be downloaded into a palm top device. eMedicine Firsts A list of all the revolutionary achievements of eMedicine from its founding in 1996 until its acquisition by WebMD in 2006 would be very long. Highlights of these achievements would include the following: First significant healthcare web based publishing and education system, one of the earliest web based learning management systems (GPS 1), first web based multilevel peer reviewed healthcare professional and later healthcare consumer content system, developed first mobile (Palm system) healthcare education apps, one of the earliest web based healthcare continuing education systems, and the recruitment of over 11,000 board certified healthcare professionals who created and edited content entirely online. Usage among specialists In 2012 Volsky et al. evaluated the most frequently used internet information sources by the public, (1) identifying the three most frequently referenced Internet sources; (2) comparing the content accuracy of each of the three sources and (3) ascertaining user-friendliness of each site; and (4) informing practitioners and patients of the quality of available information. They found Wikipedia, eMedicine, and NLM/NIH MedlinePlus were the most referenced sources. For content accuracy, eMedicine scored highest (84%; p<0.05) over MedlinePlus (49%) and Wikipedia (46%). The highest incidence of errors and omissions per article was found in Wikipedia (0.98¬±0.19), twice more than eMedicine (0.42¬±0.19; p<0.05). Errors were similar between MedlinePlus and both eMedicine and Wikipedia. On ratings for user interface, which incorporated Flesch-Kinkaid Reading Level and Flesch Reading Ease, MedlinePlus was the most user-friendly (4.3¬±0.29). This was nearly twice that of eMedicine (2.4¬±0.26) and slightly greater than Wikipedia (3.7¬±0.3). All differences were significant (p<0.05). There were 7 topics for which articles were not available on MedlinePlus. They concluded \\"Knowledge of the quality of available information on the Internet improves pediatric otolaryngologists' ability to counsel parents. The top web search results for pediatric otolaryngology diagnoses are Wikipedia, MedlinePlus, and eMedicine. Online information varies in quality, with a 46-84% concordance with current textbooks. eMedicine has the most accurate, comprehensive content and fewest errors, but is more challenging to read and navigate. Both Wikipedia and MedlinePlus have lower content accuracy and more errors, however MedlinePlus is simplest of all to read, at a 9th Grade level. In 2012, Laraway and Rogers reported a structured review of journal articles that quoted The University of Washington Quality of Life Scale for head and neck cancer patients. \\"The University of Washington Quality of Life Scale (UW-QoL) is one of the most frequently reported health-related quality of life (HR-QoL) questionnaires in head and neck cancer, and since its first publication in 1993 has been used in many different cohorts. There is a considerable amount of information to assimilate and, to date, we know of no attempt that has been made to summarise publications specific to its use in a peer review journal. The aim of this review was to systematically search published papers that report its use, identify common themes, and present a tabulated summary. Several search engines were used (PubMed, Medline, Medical-Journals.com, eMedicine), and 222 abstracts were found and hand searched. A total of 66 papers were eligible for inclusion, 21 on functional outcome, 25 on predictors of HR-QoL, 19 on development or validation of the questionnaire, and one clinical trial. The review includes a diversity of studies and a range of HR-QoL outcomes following head and neck cancer. It provides clinicians and their colleagues in multidisciplinary teams with a source of quick reference to relevant papers reporting the UW-QoL, and gives a short summary of the pertinent conclusions drawn from each paper.\\" What is significant for eMedicine, is that Laraway and Rogers used PubMed, Medline Medical Journals.com and eMedicine as primary sources of information. This is significant because medline is the compendium of all NIH sponsored research. Emedicine is made up of articles translating the body of current research in medline into clinical practice guidelines from the perspective of each subspeciality. Cao, Liu, Simpson, et al revealed that medline and emedicine were used as primary resources in developing the online system AskHERMES. Physicians were asked to solve complex clinical problems using three different sources of information: AskHermes, Google and UpToDate. Surveys of the physicians who used all three systems were asked to score the three systems by ease of use, quality of answer, time spent, and overall performance. A 2009 study showed that \\"89.1% of ophthalmologist respondents accessed peer-reviewed material online, including Emedicine (60.2%).\\" A 2007 study showed that 12% of radiology residents used eMedicine as their first source when doing research on the Internet. A 2005 study ranking 114 sites rated it the second-highest Internet-based source of information for pediatric neuro-oncology, after the site of the National Cancer Institute. A 2002 study described the site's coverage of dermatology as \\"excellent and comprehensive.\\" In 2000 an article in the Journal of Ear Nose and Throat by AD Meyers from the University of Colorado School of Medicine, Denver, CO, announced the unveiling of the ENT textbook online at emedicine.com.

He was drafted in the third round of the 2003 NFL Draft by the Jacksonville Jaguars. He played college football for the University of Hawaii Warriors. Early years Manuwai was born in Honolulu, Hawaii. He attended Farrington High School in Honolulu, where he earned varsity letters three times each in football and track and field and once in basketball. In football, he earned All-Conference and All-State honors. In track and field, he was All-League in the shot put, and first team All-League and second team All-State in the discus throw. Vincent Manuwai graduated from Farrington High School in 1999. College career Manuwai attended the University of Hawaii, where he played for the Hawaii Warriors football team. He was a three-year starter and played all positions on the line. He was regarded as one of the best pass protectors in the country. He did not allow a sack in his last 35 games as a starter with 60 knockdowns. Manuwai honors include:All-America first-team choice by College Football News as a senior, All-WAC first-team, received the Warrior Club Award (team's best player). He majored in sociology. Professional career=Jacksonville Jaguars Manuwai was drafted by the Jacksonville Jaguars in the third round (72nd pick overall) of the 2003 NFL Draft. Manuwai was one of the key factors in Jacksonville's rushing success. Through the 2007 season, Manuwai started all but one game for the Jaguars and was the most successful player on the offensive line. With Manuwai as guard, the Jaguars offense rushed for 2,541 yards in 2006 and 2,391 in 2007. In 2008, however, he suffered anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) and medial collateral ligament (MCL) injuries and was placed on injured reserve for the remainder of the season. He returned in 2009, and spent the season overcoming his injury and other obstacles. In 2010, he was replaced on the starting line by Justin Smiley. He recovered the starting spot when Smiley was injured in October, and became a significant factor in the emergence of Jacksonville's formidable running game. On July 29, 2011, Manuwai was released by Jacksonville. Atlanta Falcons The Atlanta Falcons signed Manuwai on March 9, 2012. He was released on July 28, 2012.

The stadium was located to the southwest of Earl K. Long Gymnasium, which had been built the previous year, and consisted of a large home grandstand on the north side and bleachers on the south, with a cinder track surrounded by hedges in the end zones. The field was oriented in a northeast- southwest direction, mirroring the street grid of the rest of the campus. It was named for the first athletic director and football coach at the university, Clement \\"C. J\\" McNaspy. The Camellia Bowl was held there in 1948. Replaced by a newer facility called Cajun Field, the stadium was demolished in 2000 to make room for Oliver Hall, named after James R.

The original dirt track that encircled McNaspy Field partially remains as a reminder of this university landmark. The stadium was used by the university's men's soccer team until the mid-1980s. It was also used by the Pride of Acadiana for practice while a new parking garage was built on Hamilton Field. The band has since returned to a reconfigured Hamilton Field.

The thrust, noise and emission elements of the operation of a jet engine are of vital importance in the takeoff phase of operation of the aircraft. The thrust and fuel consumption elements, and their variation with altitude, are of vital importance in the climb and cruise phases of operation of the aircraft. The behaviour of a jet engine and its effect both on the aircraft and the environment is categorised into different engineering areas or disciplines. For example, the emissions come under a group called combustion, the origin of vibrations transmitted to the airframe come under an area called rotor dynamics. The understanding of how a particular fuel flow produces a definite amount of thrust at a particular point in the flight envelope is called jet engine performance. Performance is the subject of a specialised discipline within aero engine design and development teams as is the understanding of noise and emissions by their respective specialists in other groups. The fundamental performance task for a single shaft turbojet is to match the operation of the compressor, turbine and propelling nozzle. For example, the way the compressor operates is determined by the flow resistances behind it, which occur in the combustor, turbine, tailpipe and propelling nozzle.\\"Jet Propulsion for Aerospace Applications\\" Second edition,Hesse and Mumford, Pitman Publishing Corporation 1964, p172 Matching may be defined as designing, sizing, and manipulating the operating characteristics\\"Method for Determining Component Matching and Operating Characteristics for Turbojet Engines\\" David G. Evans, Lewis Research Center of the compressor, turbine and propelling nozzle. Three fundamental observations are built upon\\"Method for Determining Component Matching and Operating Characteristics for Turbojet Engines\\" David G. Evans, Lewis Research Center. Table 1 \\"Development of Matching Parameters\\" as outlined below to develop the required understanding to match the components efficiently. The flow through the compressor is the same as that through the turbine. The speeds are the same. The power produced by the turbine equals that absorbed by the compressor. In addition, the flow resistance seen by the compressor is determined by the two restrictors downstream, namely the turbine nozzle area and the propelling nozzle exit area. The above three ties between the compressor and turbine are adjusted and refined to account for the flows and powers not being equal due to, for example, compressor flow and electric and hydraulic power\\"Method for Determining Component Matching and Operating Characteristics for Turbojet Engines\\" David G. Evans, Lewis Research Center. Table 1 \\"Development of Matching Parameters\\" being diverted to the airframe. Thus the performance is understood and defined by using the practical engineering application of thermodynamics and aerodynamics.\\"Gas Turbine Aero- Thermodynamics\\" Sir Frank Whittle This article covers a wide scope of the discipline of jet engine performance. Navigating this article Specific values of thrust and fuel consumption are promised to a prospective aircraft customer and these are derived using procedures detailed in section \\"Design point performance equations\\" and \\"Simple off-design calculation\\". An explanation for \\"off-design\\" is given in \\"General\\". An aircraft receives pneumatic, electric and hydraulic power in return for some of the fuel it supplies. This is mentioned in \\"Installation Effects\\". These effects define the difference between the performance of an uninstalled engine (as measured on a test bed) and one installed on an aircraft. When air is taken from the compressor and used to cool the turbine it has an adverse effect on the amount of fuel required to give the required thrust. This is covered in \\"Cooling Bleeds\\". The effect of fundamental design changes to the engine, such as increased pressure ratio and turbine inlet temperature, is covered in \\"Cycle improvements'. Ways to increase the pressure ratio are also covered. The effects of over-fuelling and under-fuelling which occur with changes in thrust demand are covered in \\"Transient model\\". There is an explanation of the Husk plot which is a concise way of summarising the performance of the engine. The thrust available is restricted by the turbine temperature limit at high ambient temperatures as explained in the \\"Rated performance\\" sections. Design point=TS diagram Typical temperature vs. entropy (TS) Diagram for a single spool turbojet. Note that 1 CHU/(lb K) = 1 Btu/(lb ¬∞R) = 1 Btu/(lb ¬∞F) = 1 kcal/(kg ¬∞C) = 4.184 kJ/(kg¬∑K). Temperature vs. entropy (TS) diagrams (see example RHS) are usually used to illustrate the cycle of gas turbine engines. Entropy represents the degree of disorder of the molecules in the fluid. It tends to increase as energy is converted between different forms, i.e. chemical and mechanical. The TS diagram shown on the RHS is for a single spool turbojet, where a single drive shaft connects the turbine unit with the compressor unit. Apart from stations 0 and 8s, stagnation pressure and stagnation temperature are used. Station 0 is ambient. Stagnation quantities are frequently used in gas turbine cycle studies, because no knowledge of the flow velocity is required. The processes depicted are: ;Freestream (stations 0 to 1) :In the example, the aircraft is stationary, so stations 0 and 1 are coincident. Station 1 is not depicted on the diagram. ;Intake (stations 1 to 2) :In the example, a 100% intake pressure recovery is assumed, so stations 1 and 2 are coincident. ;Compression (stations 2 to 3) :The ideal process would appear vertical on a TS diagram. In the real process there is friction, turbulence and, possibly, shock losses, making the exit temperature, for a given pressure ratio, higher than ideal. The shallower the positive slope on the TS diagram, the less efficient the compression process. ;Combustion (stations 3 to 4) :Heat (usually by burning fuel) is added, raising the temperature of the fluid. There is an associated pressure loss, some of which is unavoidable ;Turbine (stations 4 to 5) :The temperature rise in the compressor dictates that there will be an associated temperature drop across the turbine. Ideally the process would be vertical on a TS diagram. However, in the real process, friction and turbulence cause the pressure drop to be greater than ideal. The shallower the negative slope on the TS diagram, the less efficient the expansion process. ;Jetpipe (stations 5 to 8) :In the example the jetpipe is very short, so there is no pressure loss. Consequently, stations 5 and 8 are coincident on the TS diagram. ;Nozzle (stations 8 to 8s) :These two stations are both at the throat of the (convergent) nozzle. Station 8s represents static conditions. Not shown on the example TS diagram is the expansion process, external to the nozzle, down to ambient pressure. Design point performance equations In theory, any combination of flight condition/throttle setting can be nominated as the engine performance Design Point. Usually, however, the Design Point corresponds to the highest corrected flow at inlet to the compression system (e.g. Top-of-Climb, Mach 0.85, 35,000 ft, ISA). The design point net thrust of any jet engine can be estimated by working through the engine cycle, step by step. Below are the equations for a single spool turbojet.\\"Gas Turbine Theory\\" Cohen, Rogers, Saravanamuttoo , para 3.3 \\"Simple turbojet cycle\\" =Freestream= The stagnation (or total) temperature in the freestream approaching the engine can be estimated using the following equation, derived from the Steady Flow Energy Equation: T_1 = t_0 \\\\cdot (1 + ({\\\\gamma}_c-1)\\\\cdot M^2/2) The corresponding freestream stagnation (or total) pressure is: P_1 = p_0 \\\\cdot (T_1/t_0)^ {{\\\\gamma}_c/({\\\\gamma}_c-1)} =Intake= Since there is no work or heat loss in the intake under steady state conditions: T_2=T_1 \\\\, However, friction and shock losses in the intake system must be accounted for: P_2=P_1 \\\\cdot \\\\mathrm{prf} =Compressor= The actual discharge temperature of the compressor, assuming a polytropic efficiency is given by: T_3 = T_2 \\\\cdot (P_3/P_2) ^ {{(\\\\gamma}_c-1)/({\\\\gamma}_c \\\\cdot {\\\\eta}pc)} Normally a compressor pressure ratio is assumed, so: P_3 = P_2 \\\\cdot (P_3/P_2) =Combustor= A turbine rotor inlet temperature is usually assumed: T_4 = \\\\mathrm{RIT} \\\\, The pressure loss in the combustor reduces the pressure at turbine entry: P_4 = P_3 \\\\cdot (P_4/P_3) =Turbine= Equating the turbine and compressor powers and ignoring any power offtake (e.g. to drive an alternator, pump, etc.), we have: w_4 \\\\cdot C_{\\\\mathrm{pt}}(T_4-T_5) = w_2 \\\\cdot C_{\\\\mathrm{pc}}(T_3-T_2) A simplifying assumption sometimes made is for the addition of fuel flow to be exactly offset by an overboard compressor bleed, so mass flow remains constant throughout the cycle. The pressure ratio across the turbine can be calculated, assuming a turbine polytropic efficiency: P_4/P_5 = (T_4/T_5)^{{\\\\gamma}_t/(({\\\\gamma}_t-1).{\\\\eta}_\\\\mathrm{pt})} Obviously: P_5 = P_4 / (P_4/P_5) \\\\, =Jetpipe= Since, under Steady State conditions, there is no work or heat loss in the jetpipe: T_8 = T_5 \\\\, However, the jetpipe pressure loss must be accounted for: P_8 = P_5 \\\\cdot (P_8/P_5) \\\\, =Nozzle= Is the nozzle choked? The nozzle is choked when the throat Mach number = 1.0. This occurs when the nozzle pressure ratio reaches or exceeds a critical level: (P_8/p_{\\\\mathrm{8s}})crit = (({\\\\gamma}_t+1)/2))^{{\\\\gamma}_t/({\\\\gamma}_t-1)} \\\\, If (P_8/p_0) >= (P_8/p_{\\\\mathrm{8s}})crit \\\\, then the nozzle is CHOKED. If (P_8/p_0) < (P_8/p_{\\\\mathrm{8s}})crit \\\\, then the nozzle is UNCHOKED. =Choked Nozzle= The following calculation method is only suitable for choked nozzles. Assuming the nozzle is choked, the nozzle static temperature is calculated as follows: t_{\\\\mathrm{8s}} = T_8/(({\\\\gamma}_t+1)/2) \\\\, Similarly for the nozzle static pressure: p_{\\\\mathrm{8s}} = P_8/(T_8/t_{\\\\mathrm{8s}})^{{\\\\gamma}_t/({\\\\gamma}_t-1)} The nozzle throat velocity (squared) is calculated using the Steady Flow Energy Equation: V_8^2 = 2gJC_{pt}(T_8 - t_{\\\\mathrm{8s}}) The density of the gases at the nozzle throat is given by: {\\\\rho}_{\\\\mathrm{8s}} = p_{\\\\mathrm{8s}}/(R \\\\cdot t_{\\\\mathrm{8s}}) Nozzle throat effective area is estimated as follows: A_8 = w_8/({\\\\rho}_{\\\\mathrm{8s}} \\\\cdot V_8) =Gross thrust= There are two terms in the nozzle gross thrust equation; ideal momentum thrust and ideal pressure thrust. The latter term is only non-zero if the nozzle is choked: F_g = C_\\\\mathrm{x}((w_8 \\\\cdot V_8/g) + A_8(p_{\\\\mathrm{8s}} - p_0)) \\\\, =Unchoked nozzle= The following special calculation is required, if the nozzle happens to be unchoked. Once unchoked, the nozzle static pressure is equal to ambient pressure: p_{\\\\mathrm{8s}} = p_0 \\\\, The nozzle static temperature is calculated from the nozzle total/static pressure ratio: t_{\\\\mathrm{8s}} = T_8/(P_8/p_{\\\\mathrm{8s}})^{{(\\\\gamma}_t-1)/{\\\\gamma}_t} The nozzle throat velocity (squared) is calculated, as before, using the steady flow energy equation: V_8^2 = 2gJC_{pt}(T_8 - t_{\\\\mathrm{8s}}) =Gross thrust= The nozzle pressure thrust term is zero if the nozzle is unchoked, so only the Momentum Thrust needs to be calculated: F_g = C_\\\\mathrm{x}(w_8 \\\\cdot V_8/g) \\\\, =Ram drag= In general, there is a ram drag penalty for taking air onboard via the intake: F_r = w_0 \\\\cdot V_0/g =Net thrust= The ram drag must be deducted from the nozzle gross thrust: F_n = F_g - F_r \\\\, The calculation of the combustor fuel flow is beyond the scope of this text, but is basically proportional to the combustor entry airflow and a function of the combustor temperature rise. Note that mass flow is the sizing parameter: doubling the airflow, doubles the thrust and the fuel flow. However, the specific fuel consumption (fuel flow/net thrust) is unaffected, assuming scale effects are neglected. Similar design point calculations can be done for other types of jet engine e.g. turbofan, turboprop, ramjet, etc. The method of calculation shown above is fairly crude, but is useful for gaining a basic understanding of aeroengine performance. Most engine manufacturers use a more exact method, known as True Specific Heat. High pressures and temperatures at elevated levels of supersonic speeds would invoke the use of even more exotic calculations: i.e. Frozen Chemistry and Equilibrium Chemistry.

This is pessimistic, since the bleed air is assumed to be dumped directly overboard (thereby bypassing the propulsion nozzle) and unable to contribute to the thrust of the engine. In a more sophisticated performance model, the cooling air for the first row of (static) turbine nozzle guide vanes (immediately downstream of the combustor) can be safely disregarded, since for a given (HP) rotor inlet temperature it has no effect upon either the combustor fuel flow or the net thrust of the engine. However, the turbine rotor cooling air must be included in such a model. The rotor cooling bleed air is extracted from compressor delivery and passes along narrow passageways before being injected into the base of the rotating blades. The bleed air negotiates a complex set of passageways within the aerofoil extracting heat before being dumped into the gas stream adjacent to the blade surface. In a sophisticated model, the turbine rotor cooling air is assumed to quench the main gas stream emerging from turbine, reducing its temperature, but also increasing its mass flow: i.e. w_{\\\\mathrm{rotorexit}} \\\\cdot C_{\\\\mathrm{pt}}\\\\cdot T_{\\\\mathrm{rotorexit}} = w_{\\\\mathrm{rotorbleed}} \\\\cdot C_{\\\\mathrm{pc}}\\\\cdot T_{\\\\mathrm{rotorbleed}} + w_{\\\\mathrm{rotorentry}} \\\\cdot C_{\\\\mathrm{pt}}\\\\cdot T_{\\\\mathrm{rotorentry}} \\\\, w_{\\\\mathrm{rotorexit}} = w_{\\\\mathrm{rotorbleed}} + w_{\\\\mathrm{rotorentry}} \\\\, The bleed air cooling the turbine discs is treated in a similar manner. The usual assumption is that the low energy disc cooling air cannot contribute to the engine cycle until it has passed through one row of blades or vanes. Naturally any bleed air returned to the cycle (or dumped overboard) must also be deducted from the main air flow at the point it is bled from the compressor. If some of the cooling air is bled from part way along the compressor (i.e. interstage), the power absorbed by the unit must be adjusted accordingly.\\"Jet Engine Performance\\" Walsh and Fletcher para 5.15.3 \\"Magnitudes of turbine and NGV blade cooling flows\\" Cycle improvements Increasing the design overall pressure ratio of the compression system raises the combustor entry temperature. Therefore, at a fixed fuel flow and airflow, there is an increase in turbine inlet temperature. Although the higher temperature rise across the compression system implies a larger temperature drop over the turbine system, the nozzle temperature is unaffected, because the same amount of heat is being added to the total system. There is, however, a rise in nozzle pressure, because turbine expansion ratio increases more slowly than the overall pressure ratio (which is inferred by the divergence of the constant pressure lines on the TS diagram). Consequently, net thrust increases, implying a specific fuel consumption (fuel flow/net thrust) decrease. So turbojets can be made more fuel efficient by raising overall pressure ratio and turbine inlet temperature in unison. However, better turbine materials and/or improved vane/blade cooling are required to cope with increases in both turbine inlet temperature and compressor delivery temperature. Increasing the latter may also require better compressor materials. Also, higher combustion temperatures can potentially lead to greater emissions of nitrogen oxides, associated with acid rain. Adding a rear stage to the compressor, to raise overall pressure ratio, does not require a shaft speed increase, but it reduces core size and requires a smaller flow size turbine, which is expensive to change. Alternatively, adding a zero (i.e. front) stage to the compressor, to increase overall pressure ratio, will require an increase in shaft speed (to maintain the same blade tip Mach number on each of the original compressor stages, since the delivery temperature of each of these stages will be higher than datum). The increase in shaft speed raises the centrifugal stresses in both the turbine blade and disc. This together with increases in the hot gas and cooling air (from the compressor) temperatures implies a decrease in component lives and/or an upgrade in component materials. Adding a zero stage also induces more airflow into the engine, thereby increasing net thrust. If the increase overall pressure ratio is obtained aerodynamically (i.e. without adding stage/s), an increase in shaft speed will still probably be required, which affects blade/disc stresses and component lives/material. Other gas turbine engine types Design point calculations for other gas turbine engine types are similar in format to that given above for a single spool turbojet. The design point calculation for a two spool turbojet, has two compression calculations; one for the Low Pressure (LP) Compressor, the other for the High Pressure (HP) Compressor. There is also two turbine calculations; one for the HP Turbine, the other for the LP Turbine. In a two spool unmixed turbofan, the LP Compressor calculation is usually replaced by Fan Inner (i.e. hub) and Fan Outer (i.e. tip) compression calculations. The power absorbed by these two \\"components\\" is taken as the load on the LP turbine. After the Fan Outer compression calculation, there is a Bypass Duct pressure loss/Bypass Nozzle expansion calculation. Net thrust is obtained by deducting the intake ram drag from the sum of the Core Nozzle and Bypass Nozzle gross thrusts. A two spool mixed turbofan design point calculation is very similar to that for an unmixed engine, except the Bypass Nozzle calculation is replaced by a Mixer calculation, where the static pressures of the core and bypass streams at the mixing plane are usually assumed to be equal. Off-design=General An engine is said to be running off-design if any of the following apply: :a) change of throttle setting :b) change of altitude :c) change of flight speed :d) change of climate :e) change of installation (e.g. customer bleed or power off-take or intake pressure recovery) :f) change in geometry Although each off-design point is effectively a design point calculation, the resulting cycle (normally) has the same turbine and nozzle geometry as that at the engine design point. Obviously the final nozzle cannot be over or underfilled with flow. This rule also applies to the turbine nozzle guide vanes, which act like small nozzles. Simple Off-design Calculation Typical compressor working line generated using Simple Off-design Calculation Design point calculations are normally done by a computer program. By the addition of an iterative loop, such a program can also be used to create a simple off-design model.\\"Jet Propulsion\\" Nicholas Cumpsty , Ch12 \\"Engine matching off design In an iteration, a calculation is undertaken using guessed values for the variables. At the end of the calculation, the constraint values are analyzed and an attempt is made to improve the guessed values of the variables. The calculation is then repeated using the new guesses. This procedure is repeated until the constraints are within the desired tolerance (e.g. 0.1%). Iteration variables The three variables required for a single spool turbojet iteration are the key design variables: 1) some function of combustor fuel flow e.g. turbine rotor inlet temperature RIT\\\\, 2) corrected engine mass flow i.e. w_{\\\\mathrm{2cor}}\\\\, 3) compressor pressure ratio i.e. P_3/P_2\\\\, Iteration constraints (or matching quantities) The three constraints imposed would typically be: 1) engine match e.g. Fn\\\\, or w_{\\\\mathrm{fe}}\\\\, or T_3\\\\, , etc.''' 2) nozzle area e.g. A_{\\\\mathrm{8calc}}\\\\, vs A_{\\\\mathrm{8 des pt}}\\\\, 3) turbine flow capacity e.g. w_{\\\\mathrm{4cor calc}}\\\\, vs w_{\\\\mathrm{4cor des pt}}\\\\, The latter two are the physical constraints that must be met, whilst the former is some measure of throttle setting. Note Corrected flow is the flow that would pass through a device, if the entry pressure and temperature corresponded to ambient conditions at sea level on a Standard Day. Results Plotted above are the results of several off-design calculations, showing the effect of throttling a jet engine from its design point condition. This line is known as the compressor steady state (as opposed to transient) working line. Over most of the throttle range, the turbine system on a turbojet operates between choked planes. All the turbine throats are choked, as well as the final nozzle. Consequently, the turbine pressure ratio stays essentially constant. This implies a fixed \\\\triangle T_{\\\\mathrm{turb}}/RIT\\\\,. Since turbine rotor entry temperature, RIT\\\\,, usually falls with throttling, the temperature drop across the turbine system, \\\\triangle T_{\\\\mathrm{turb}}\\\\,, must also decrease. However, the temperature rise across the compression system, \\\\triangle T_{\\\\mathrm{comp}}\\\\,, is proportional to \\\\triangle T_{\\\\mathrm{turb}}\\\\,. Consequently, the ratio \\\\triangle T_{\\\\mathrm{comp}}/T_1\\\\, must also fall, implying a decrease in the compression system pressure ratio. The non-dimensional (or corrected flow) at compressor exit tends to stay constant, because it 'sees', beyond the combustor, the constant corrected flow of the choked turbine. Consequently, there must be a decrease in compressor entry corrected flow, as compressor pressure ratio falls. Therefore, the compressor steady state working line has a positive slope, as shown above, on the RHS. Ratio RIT/T_1\\\\, is the quantity that determines the throttle setting of the engine. So, for instance, raising intake stagnation temperature by increasing flight speed, at a constant RIT\\\\, , will cause the engine to throttle back to a lower corrected flow/pressure ratio. Fairly obviously, when an engine is throttled-back, it will lose net thrust. This drop in thrust is mainly caused by the reduction in air mass flow, but the reduction in turbine rotor inlet temperature and degradations in component performance will also contribute. The simple off-design calculation outlined above is somewhat crude, since it assumes: 1) no variation in compressor and turbine efficiency with throttle setting 2) no change in pressure losses with component entry flow 3) no variation in turbine flow capacity or nozzle discharge coefficient with throttle setting Furthermore, there is no indication of relative shaft speed or compressor surge margin Complex Off-design Calculation Typical compressor working line generated using Complex Off-design Calculation A more refined off-design model can be created using compressor maps and turbine maps to predict off-design corrected mass flows, pressure ratios, efficiencies, relative shaft speeds, etc. A further refinement is to allow the component off-design pressure losses to vary with corrected mass flow, or Mach number, etc. The iteration scheme is similar to that of the Simple Off-design Calculation. Iteration variables Again three variables are required for a single spool turbojet iteration, typically: 1) some function of combustor fuel flow e.g. RIT\\\\, 2) compressor corrected speed e.g. N_{\\\\mathrm{cor}}\\\\, 3) an independent variable indicative of the compressor operating point up a speed line e.g. {\\\\beta}\\\\, . So compressor corrected speed replaces corrected engine mass flow and Beta replaces compressor pressure ratio. Iteration constraints (or matching quantities) The three constraints imposed would typically be similar to before: 1) engine match e.g. F_n\\\\, or w_{\\\\mathrm{fe}}\\\\, or T_{\\\\mathrm{3}}\\\\, , etc. 2) nozzle area e.g. A_{\\\\mathrm{8 geometricdesign}}\\\\, vs A_{\\\\mathrm{8calc}}/C_{\\\\mathrm{dcalc}}\\\\, 3) turbine flow capacity e.g. w_{\\\\mathrm{4cor calc}}\\\\, vs w_{\\\\mathrm{4cor turb char}}\\\\, During the Complex Off-design calculation, the operating point on the compressor map is constantly being guessed (in terms of N_{\\\\mathrm{cor}}\\\\, and {\\\\beta}\\\\, ) to obtain an estimate of the compressor mass flow, pressure ratio and efficiency. After the combustion calculation is completed, the implied compressor mechanical shaft speed is used to estimate the turbine corrected speed (i.e. N_{\\\\mathrm{turb cor}}\\\\, ). Typically, the turbine load (power demanded) and entry flow and temperature are used to estimate the turbine enthalpy drop/inlet temperature (i.e. ({\\\\delta}H/T)_{\\\\mathrm{turb}} \\\\, ). The estimated turbine corrected speed and enthalpy drop/inlet temperature parameters are used to obtain, from the turbine map, an estimate of the turbine corrected flow (w_{\\\\mathrm{4cor turb char}}\\\\, ) and efficiency (i.e. {\\\\eta}_{\\\\mathrm{pt}}\\\\, ). The calculation then continues, in the usual way, through the turbine, jetpipe and nozzle. If the constraints are not within tolerance, the iteration engine makes another guess at the iteration variables and the iterative loop is restarted. Plotted on the LHS are the results of several off-design calculations, showing the effect of throttling a jet engine from its design point condition. The line produced is similar to the working line shown above, but it is now superimposed on the compressor map and gives an indication of corrected shaft speed and compressor surge margin. Performance model Whatever it's sophistication, the off-design program is not only used to predict the off-design performance of the engine, but also assist in the design process (e.g. estimating maximum shaft speeds, pressures, temperatures, etc. to support component stressing). Other models will be constructed to simulate the behavior (in some detail) of the various individual components (e.g. rotor 2 of the compressor). Installation effects More often than not, the design point calculation is for an uninstalled engine. Installation effects are normally introduced at off-design conditions and will depend on the engine application. A partially installed engine includes the effect of: a) the real intake having a pressure recovery of less than 100% b) air being bled from the compression system for cabin/cockpit conditioning and to cool the avionics c) oil and fuel pump loads on the HP shaft In addition, in a fully installed engine, various drags erode the effective net thrust of the engine: 1) an air intake spilling air creates drag 2) exhaust gases, exiting the hot nozzle, can scrub the external part of the nozzle plug (where applicable) and create drag 3) if the jet engine is a civil turbofan, bypass air, exiting the cold nozzle, can scrub the gas generator cowl and the submerged portion of the pylon (where applicable) and create drag Deducting these throttle-dependent drags (where applicable) from the net thrust calculated above gives the streamtube net thrust. There is, however, another installation effect: freestream air scrubbing an exposed fan cowl and its associated pylon (where applicable) will create drag. Deducting this term from the streamtube net thrust yields the force applied by the engine to the airframe proper. In a typical military installation, where the engine is buried within the airframe, only some of the above installation effects apply. Transient model So far we have examined steady state performance modelling.\\"Gas Turbine Theory\\" Cohen, Rogers, Saravanamuttoo ,\\"Prediction of transient performance\\"pp290-296\\"Gas Turbine Performance\\" Walsh and Fletcher section 8.11 \\"Transient performance and control models\\" A crude transient performance model can be developed by relatively minor adjustments to the off-design calculation. A transient acceleration (or deceleration) is assumed to cover a large number of small time steps of, say, 0.01 s duration. During each time step, the shaft speed is assumed to be momentarily constant. So in the modified off-design iteration, N\\\\, is frozen and a new variable, the excess turbine power {\\\\delta}P_w\\\\, , allowed to float instead. After the iteration has converged, the excess power is used to estimate the change in shaft speed: Now: Acceleration torque = spool inertia * shaft angular acceleration {\\\\delta}\\\\,{\\\\tau}\\\\, = I\\\\, K\\\\, dN\\\\, /dt\\\\, Rearranging: dN\\\\, = ( {\\\\delta}\\\\,{\\\\tau}\\\\, /( I\\\\, K\\\\, )) dt\\\\, But: {\\\\delta}P_w\\\\, = 2\\\\, {\\\\pi}\\\\, N\\\\, {\\\\delta}\\\\,{\\\\tau}\\\\, /K_1\\\\, So: dN\\\\, = (K_1\\\\, {\\\\delta}P_w\\\\, / ( 2\\\\, {\\\\pi}\\\\, I\\\\, N\\\\, K\\\\, )) dt\\\\, Or approximating: {\\\\delta}N\\\\, = (K_2\\\\, {\\\\delta}P_w\\\\, / (I\\\\, N\\\\, )) {\\\\delta}t\\\\, This change in shaft speed is used to calculate a new (frozen) shaft speed for the next time interval: N_{\\\\mathrm{new}}\\\\, = N_{\\\\mathrm{old}}\\\\, \\\\+ {\\\\delta}N\\\\, The whole process, described above, is then repeated for the new time: t_{\\\\mathrm{new}}\\\\, = t_{\\\\mathrm{old}}\\\\, \\\\+ {\\\\delta}t\\\\, The starting point for the transient is some steady state point (e.g. Ground Idle, Sea Level Static, ISA). A ramp of fuel flow versus time is, for instance, fed into the model to simulate, say, a slam acceleration (or deceleration). The transient calculation is first undertaken for time zero, with the steady state fuel flow as the engine match, which should result in zero excess turbine power. By definition, the first transient calculation should reproduce the datum steady state point. The fuel flow for tnew\\\\, is calculated from the fuel flow ramp and is used as the revised engine match in the next transient iterative calculation. This process is repeated until the transient simulation is completed. The transient model described above is pretty crude, since it only takes into account inertia effects, other effects being ignored. For instance, under transient conditions the entry mass flow to a volume (e.g. jetpipe) needn't be the same as the exit mass flow; i.e. the volume could be acting as an accumulator, storing or discharging gas. Similarly part of the engine structure (e.g. nozzle wall) could be extracting or adding heat to the gas flow, which would affect that component's discharge temperature. During a Slam Acceleration on a single spool turbojet, the working line of the compressor tends to deviate from the steady state working line and adopt a curved path, initially going towards surge, but slowly returning to the steady state line, as the fuel flow reaches a new higher steady state value. During the initial overfuelling, the inertia of the spool tends to prevent the shaft speed from accelerating rapidly. Naturally, the extra fuel flow increases the turbine rotor entry temperature, RIT\\\\, . Since the turbine operates between two choked planes (i.e. the turbine and nozzle throats), the turbine pressure ratio and the corresponding temperature drop/entry temperature, \\\\triangle T_{\\\\mathrm{turb}}/RIT\\\\,, remain approximately constant. Since RIT\\\\, increases, so must the temperature drop across the turbine and the turbine power output. This extra turbine power, increases the temperature rise across the compressor and, therefore, the compressor pressure ratio. Since the corrected speed of the compressor has hardly changed, the working point tends to move upwards, along a line of roughly constant corrected speed. As time progresses the shaft begins to accelerate and the effect just described diminishes. During a Slam Deceleration, the opposite trend is observed; the transient compressor working line goes below the steady state line. The transient behaviour of the high pressure (HP) compressor of a turbofan is similar to that described above for a single spool turbojet. Performance software Over the years a number of software packages have been developed to estimate the design, off-design and transient performance of various types of gas turbine engine. Most are used in-house by the various aero-engine manufacturers, but several software packages are available to the general public (e.g. NPSS http://www.npssconsortium.org, GasTurb http://www.gasturb.de, EngineSim http://www.grc.nasa.gov/WWW/K-12//airplane/ngnsim.html, GSP https://www.gspteam.com/, PROOSIS http://www.proosis.com). Husk plot A Husk Plot is a concise way of summarizing the performance of a jet engine. The following sections describe how the plot is generated and can be used. Thrust/SFC loops Specific Fuel Consumption (i.e. SFC), defined as fuel flow/net thrust, is an important parameter reflecting the overall thermal (or fuel) efficiency of an engine. As an engine is throttled back there will be a variation of SFC with net thrust, because of changes in the engine cycle (e.g. lower overall pressure ratio) and variations in component performance (e.g. compressor efficiency). When plotted, the resultant curve is known as a thrust/SFC loop. A family of these curves can be generated at Sea Level, Standard Day, conditions over a range of flight speeds. A Husk Plot (RHS) can be developed using this family of curves. The net thrust scale is simply relabeled Fn/{\\\\delta}\\\\, , where {\\\\delta}\\\\, is relative ambient pressure, whilst the SFC scale is relabeled SFC/\\\\sqrt{\\\\theta}\\\\, , where {\\\\theta}\\\\, is relative ambient temperature. The resulting plot can be used to estimate engine net thrust and SFC at any altitude, flight speed and climate for a range of throttle setting.Typical Husk Plot Selecting a point on the plot, net thrust is calculated as follows: Fn = (Fn/{\\\\delta}) \\\\cdot {\\\\delta} Clearly, net thrust falls with altitude, because of the decrease in ambient pressure. The corresponding SFC is calculated as follows: SFC = (SFC/\\\\sqrt{\\\\theta}) \\\\cdot \\\\sqrt{\\\\theta} At a given point on the Husk Plot, SFC falls with decreasing ambient temperature (e.g. increasing altitude or colder climate). The basic reason why SFC increases with flight speed is the implied increase in ram drag. Although a Husk Plot is a concise way of summarizing the performance of a jet engine, the predictions obtained at altitude will be slightly optimistic. For instance, because ambient temperature remains constant above 11,000 m (36,089 ft) altitude, at a fixed non-dimensional point the Husk plot would yield no change in SFC with increasing altitude. In reality, there would be a small, steady, increase in SFC, owing to the falling Reynolds number. Thrust lapse The nominal net thrust quoted for a jet engine usually refers to the Sea Level Static (SLS) condition, either for the International Standard Atmosphere (ISA) or a hot day condition (e.g. ISA+10 ¬∞C). As an example, the GE90-76B has a take-off static thrust of 76,000 lbf (360 kN) at SLS, ISA+15 ¬∞C. Naturally, net thrust will decrease with altitude, because of the lower air density. There is also, however, a flight speed effect. Initially as the aircraft gains speed down the runway, there will be little increase in nozzle pressure and temperature, because the ram rise in the intake is very small. There will also be little change in mass flow. Consequently, nozzle gross thrust initially only increases marginally with flight speed. However, being an air breathing engine (unlike a conventional rocket) there is a penalty for taking on-board air from the atmosphere. This is known as ram drag. Although the penalty is zero at static conditions, it rapidly increases with flight speed causing the net thrust to be eroded. As flight speed builds up after take-off, the ram rise in the intake starts to have a significant effect upon nozzle pressure/temperature and intake airflow, causing nozzle gross thrust to climb more rapidly. This term now starts to offset the still increasing ram drag, eventually causing net thrust to start to increase. In some engines, the net thrust at say Mach 1.0, sea level can even be slightly greater than the static thrust. Above Mach 1.0, with a subsonic inlet design, shock losses tend to decrease net thrust, however a suitably designed supersonic inlet can give a lower reduction in intake pressure recovery, allowing net thrust to continue to climb in the supersonic regime. The thrust lapse described above depends on the design specific thrust and, to a certain extent, on how the engine is rated with intake temperature. Three possible ways of rating an engine are depicted on the above Husk Plot. The engine could be rated at constant turbine entry temperature, shown on the plot as SOT/{\\\\theta}\\\\, . Alternatively, a constant mechanical shaft speed could be assumed, depicted as N_F/\\\\sqrt{\\\\theta}\\\\, . A further alternative is a constant compressor corrected speed, shown as N_F/\\\\sqrt{\\\\theta}_T\\\\, . The variation of net thrust with flight Mach number can be clearly seen on the Husk Plot. Other trends The Husk Plot can also be used to indicate trends in the following parameters: 1) turbine entry temperature SOT = (SOT/{\\\\theta}) \\\\cdot {\\\\theta}\\\\, So as ambient temperature falls (through increasing altitude or a cooler climate), turbine entry temperature must also fall to stay at the same non-dimensional point on the Husk Plot. All the other non-dimensional groups (e.g. corrected flow, axial and peripheral Mach numbers, pressure ratios, efficiencies, etc. will also stay constant). 2) mechanical shaft speed N_F = (N_F/\\\\sqrt{\\\\theta}) \\\\cdot \\\\sqrt{\\\\theta}\\\\, Again as ambient temperature falls (through increasing altitude or a cooler climate), mechanical shaft speed must also decrease to remain at the same non- dimensional point. By definition, compressor corrected speed, N_F/\\\\sqrt{\\\\theta}_T\\\\, , must remain constant at a given non-dimensional point. Rated Performance=Civil Typical civil rating system Nowadays, civil engines are usually flat-rated on net thrust up to a 'kink-point' climate. So at a given flight condition, net thrust is held approximately constant over a very wide range of ambient temperature, by increasing (HP) turbine rotor inlet temperature (RIT or SOT). However, beyond the kink-point, SOT is held constant and net thrust starts to fall for further increases in ambient temperature.\\"Gas Turbine Performance\\" Walsh and Fletcher ,section 7.8 \\"Ratings and control\\", fig718\\"Typical rating curves flight engines\\" Consequently, aircraft fuel load and/or payload must be decreased. Usually, for a given rating, the kink-point SOT is held constant, regardless of altitude or flight speed. Some engines have a special rating, known as the 'Denver Bump'. This invokes a higher RIT than normal, to enable fully laden aircraft to Take-off safely from Denver, CO in the summer months. Denver Airport is extremely hot in the summer and the runways are over a mile above sea level. Both of these factors affect engine thrust Military Typical military rating system The rating systems used on military engines vary from engine to engine. A typical military rating structure is shown on the left. Such a rating system maximises the thrust available from the engine cycle chosen, whilst respecting the aerodynamic and mechanical limits imposed on the turbomachinery. If there is adequate thrust to meet the aircraft's mission in a particular range of intake temperature, the engine designer may elect to truncate the schedule shown, to lower the turbine rotor inlet temperature and, thereby, improve engine life. At low intake temperatures, the engine tends to operate at maximum corrected speed or corrected flow. As intake temperature rises, a limit on (HP) turbine rotor inlet temperature (SOT) takes effect, progressively reducing corrected flow. At even higher intake temperatures, a limit on compressor delivery temperature (T3) is invoked, which decreases both SOT and corrected flow. Effect of design intake temperature The effect of design intake temperature is shown on the right hand side. An engine with a low design T1 combines high corrected flow with high rotor turbine temperature (SOT), maximizing net thrust at low T1 conditions (e.g. Mach 0.9, 30000 ft, ISA). However, although turbine rotor inlet temperature stays constant as T1 increases, there is a steady decrease in corrected flow, resulting in poor net thrust at high T1 conditions (e.g. Mach 0.9, sea level, ISA). Although an engine with a high design T1 has a high corrected flow at low T1 conditions, the SOT is low, resulting in a poor net thrust. Only at high T1 conditions is there the combination of a high corrected flow and a high SOT, to give good thrust characteristics. A compromise between these two extremes would be to design for a medium intake temperature (say 290 K). As T1 increases along the SOT plateau, the engines will throttle back, causing both a decrease in corrected airflow and overall pressure ratio. As shown, the chart implies a common T3 limit for both the low and high design T1 cycles. Roughly speaking, the T3 limit will correspond to a common overall pressure ratio at the T3 breakpoint. Although both cycles will increase throttle setting as T1 decreases, the low design T1 cycle has a greater 'spool-up' before hitting the corrected speed limit. Consequently, the low design T1 cycle has a higher design overall pressure ratio.\\"Jet Propulsion\\" Nicholas Cumpsty , \\"Some constraints on combat aircraft engines\\"pp206-209, fig15.9 Nomenclature *A\\\\, flow area *A_{\\\\mathrm{8calc}}\\\\, calculated nozzle effective throat area *A_{\\\\mathrm{8 des pt}}\\\\, design point nozzle effective throat area *A_{\\\\mathrm{8 geometricdesign}}\\\\, nozzle geometric throat area *{\\\\alpha}\\\\, shaft angular acceleration *{\\\\beta}\\\\, arbitrary lines which dissect the corrected speed lines on a compressor characteristic *C_{\\\\mathrm{pc}}\\\\, specific heat at constant pressure for air *C_{\\\\mathrm{pt}}\\\\, specific heat at constant pressure for combustion products *C_{\\\\mathrm{dcalc}}\\\\, calculated nozzle discharge coefficient *C_x\\\\, thrust coefficient *{\\\\delta}\\\\, ambient pressure/Sea Level ambient pressure *({\\\\delta}H/T)_{\\\\mathrm{turb}} \\\\, turbine enthalpy drop/inlet temperature *{\\\\delta}N\\\\, change in mechanical shaft speed *{\\\\delta}P_w\\\\, excess shaft power *{\\\\delta}\\\\,{\\\\tau}\\\\, excess shaft torque *{\\\\eta}_{\\\\mathrm{pc}}\\\\, compressor polytropic efficiency *{\\\\eta}_{\\\\mathrm{pt}}\\\\, turbine polytropic efficiency *g\\\\, acceleration of gravity *F_g\\\\, gross thrust *F_n\\\\, net thrust *F_r\\\\, ram drag *{\\\\gamma}_{\\\\mathrm{c}}\\\\, ratio of specific heats for air *{\\\\gamma}_{\\\\mathrm{t}}\\\\, ratio of specific heats for combustion products *I\\\\, spool inertia *J\\\\, mechanical equivalent of heat *K\\\\, constant *K_1\\\\, constant *K_2\\\\, constant *M\\\\, flight Mach number *N\\\\, compressor mechanical shaft speed *N_{\\\\mathrm{cor}}\\\\, compressor corrected shaft speed *N_{\\\\mathrm{turb cor}}\\\\, turbine corrected shaft speed *p\\\\, static pressure *P\\\\, stagnation (or total) pressure *P_3/P_2\\\\, compressor pressure ratio *prf\\\\, intake pressure recovery factor *R\\\\, gas constant *{\\\\rho}\\\\, density *SFC\\\\, specific fuel consumption *SOT\\\\, stator outlet temperature *RIT\\\\, (turbine) rotor inlet temperature *t\\\\, static temperature or time *T\\\\, stagnation (or total) temperature *T_1\\\\, intake stagnation temperature *T_3\\\\, compressor delivery total temperature *{\\\\theta}\\\\, ambient temperature/Sea Level, Standard Day, ambient temperature *{\\\\theta}_T\\\\, total temperature/Sea Level, Standard Day, ambient temperature *V\\\\, velocity *w\\\\, mass flow *w_{\\\\mathrm{4cor calc}}\\\\, calculated turbine entry corrected flow *w_{\\\\mathrm{2cor}}\\\\, compressor corrected inlet flow *w_{\\\\mathrm{4cor des pt}}\\\\, design point turbine entry corrected flow *w_{\\\\mathrm{4cor turb char}}\\\\, corrected entry flow from turbine characteristic (or map) *w_{\\\\mathrm{fe}}\\\\, combustor fuel flow NotesReferences * Kerrebrock, Jack L.

Better known as H.A. or \\"Humpy\\" Wheeler, he has long been known as one of the foremost promoters of NASCAR auto racing. Nickname During an appearance on the National Public Radio quiz show Wait Wait... Don't Tell Me! in July 2006, Wheeler explained the origin of his nickname. He said that when his father had played football at the University of Illinois, he was caught once smoking Camel cigarettes, earning the name \\"Humpy\\" for the camel's hump. His father's friends then began calling him \\"Humpy Jr.\\" Growing up through high school, college football, and then racing, the name \\"Humpy\\" has stuck with him. Early life Wheeler was born in Belmont, North Carolina. He began his promotional career at age nine, selling tickets for a bicycle race.Bechtel 2010, p.209-210 He was a defensive lineman for the South Carolina Gamecocks in the late 1950s. His teammates included future NASCAR communications director Jim Hunter (a running back), and Jim Duncan (later known as a marketing executive at Lowe's Motor Speedway). Wheeler was also an amateur race car driver during his early years. Promotions After becoming the president of Charlotte Motor Speedway, Wheeler earned the reputation for organizing publicity stunts. A few weeks after driver Cale Yarborough gave the less-than- complimentary nickname 'Jaws' to rival driver Darrell Waltrip, Wheeler bought a giant dead shark, placed a dead chicken in the shark's mouth, and had it driven around the track on a flatbed truck before a race at Charlotte (Yarborough's sponsor at the time was Holly Farms Poultry). In 1984, the pre- race show for the World 600 was a reenactment of Operation Urgent Fury, the invasion of Grenada the previous year.Bechtel 2010, p. 267 In 2007, Wheeler announced that the Bank of America 500 would feature an \\"all-you-can-eat grandstand,\\" where fans would pay a set ticket price, and would then get to eat as much as they wanted of the grandstand's food before, during, and after the race. The publicity for this event included Nathan's Hot Dog Eating Contest champion Joey Chestnut at the press conference. Retirement The Coca-Cola 600 held on May 25, 2008 was to be Wheeler's last race as President of the Lowe's Motor Speedway. Steve Byrnes of FOX Sports and Speed TV honored Wheeler before the race and Wheeler in turn gave a speech thanking race fans from all over the United States in addition to people from foreign countries for coming to the race: \\"I owe a tremendous gratitude to you for buying tickets to our facility. If we meet again may you be in the palm of God.\\" Although he had announced that he would step down as President and General Manager of Lowe's Motor Speedway soon after the race, Wheeler had hopes of staying on as a part-time consultant especially in light of the upcoming 50th anniversary of the Speedway in 2009. However, apparently due to a falling out with Bruton Smith for reasons yet unknown, Wheeler's lengthy association with Lowe's Motor Speedway was unceremoniously ended. Smith thereafter wasted no time in appointing his son, Marcus Smith, as the new President and General Manager of the Speedway. During an interview on Speed TV's \\"Wind Tunnel\\" on June 1, 2008, Wheeler stated that in addition to working as a part-time consultant, one of his primary projects during retirement will be working on a book devoted to his recollections of the numerous personalities he has known over his many years as a racing promoter at Lowe's Motor Speedway and prior to that during his years in Indianapolis and at the Bonneville Salt Flats in Utah.

It stars John Cassavetes, Kerrie Keane, and John Ireland. The plot focuses on a small Wisconsin town where a mysterious figure is raping and murdering young women. Its title is sometimes abbreviated as simply Incubus.  Plot  In a lake at a rock quarry in rural Wisconsin, a young woman, Mandy Pullman, and her boyfriend, Roy, are swimming. The two spend the night at the lake camping, but are attacked by an unseen figure; Roy is killed, and Mandy violently raped. Mandy is taken to the hospital with a ruptured uterus and serious trauma. As the attack occurs, teenager Tim Galen experiences a recurring nightmare he has in which a woman is tortured by a monstrous figure; his grandmother, Agatha Galen, tries to dissuade him of his suspicions about the premonitory dream. At the hospital, Mandy is treated by Dr. Sam Cordell, a surgeon and physician in the small community of Galen. Sam's teenage daughter, Jenny, is dating Tim, but he disapproves of their relationship. At the hospital, Sheriff Hank Walden questions Sam about Mandy's injuries, and a nosy local reporter, Laura Kincaid, arrives to question Walden, who forces her to leave. That night at the local library and museum, a librarian, Carolyn Davies, is brutally raped and murdered while closing the building. During her autopsy, Sam finds she suffered similar wounds as Mandy, and finds an inexplicable amount of semen in her vagina. Attempts to question the comatose Mandy about her attacker are futile. Sam shows Laura pictures of his deceased second wife and notes their amazing resemblance to each other. The following day, local farmer Ernie Barnes and his two daughters are brutally slain at their farmhouse. Tim again is tormented by his vision, and runs into a local movie theater in an attempt to distract himself. While there, a young woman is raped and murdered in the downstairs bathroom of the theater, and the metal stall door is found nearly bent in half. Sheriff Walden and Sam arrive at the crime scene shortly before Laura, who insists she may be able to help the investigation. She confides in Sam that she discovered historical records detailing Satanism and similar crimes occurring throughout the town's history. Tim confronts Jenny at her home, hysterical, and says he believes his dreams are responsible for the crimes. Sam gets a sample of Tim's semen to compare against that which was found inside the victims, but they do not match. Tim and Agatha meet with Sam, Jenny, Laura, and Sheriff Walden at the library that night, where Laura reads a passage from a book detailing the shapeshifter known as the incubus, which manifests through dreams and can appear in human form. Agatha reveals that Tim's mother had died before his birth and had been accused of witchcraft due to psychic powers she possessed; Agatha claims that the Galen family has a legacy of witch hunters, and that his dreams are a result of this. Laura and Tim return with Sam and Jenny to their home. As Laura takes Jenny upstairs to go to bed, Sam attempts to induce Tim's dream to prove its connection to the murders. Tim goes into a seizure-like state and runs upstairs into Jenny's room where he tries to attack Laura with a dagger given to him by Agatha, but Sam intervenes and stabs him to death. Laura then approaches Sam, and her face briefly shifts into that of the monstrous incubus; it is revealed that Laura has in fact been the incubus all along, manifesting in female form. As Laura embraces Sam, he looks over her shoulder to see Jenny's dead body lying on her bed, blood pouring out from between her legs. CastProduction The Incubus was shot near Toronto, Ontario over a period of ten weeks. The film features the British hard rock band Samson, in the form of archival clips taken from the film Biceps of Steel, which appear onscreen during a sequence set in a movie theater. Release The film was released regionally in the United States in the late summer of 1982, with screenings beginning in Tucson, Arizona as early as August 3, 1982. It later opened in Phoenix on August 27, 1982, before expanding to cities in New Jersey and California during the autumn of 1982. Critical response Vincent Canby of The New York Times wrote the film: \\"is a supernatural horror film about rape, a subject that the R-rated movie takes a firm stand against even as it's smacking its lips. Most of the time the incubus looks like an ordinary human being but, at the end, when it's seen for the first time as its true self, it looks like a large, shaggy, extremely mean E.T. with bad teeth.\\" Ed Blank of the Pittsburgh Press criticized the film's plot and direction, but conceded the musical score as \\"chilling.\\" Rick Kogan of The Journal News deemed the film \\"mindlessly bloody, crudely made and distasteful,\\" concluding that it was \\"vile and mean-spirited.\\" The Atlanta Constitutions Eleanor Ringel similarly noted the film's overt violence, deeming it \\"disturbingly nasty, [but] not so poorly done that you can completely shrug it off.\\" She was critical of the screenplay, however, concluding that the film \\"tries to resolve itself in the last three minutes.\\" In his 1983 book The Best, Worst, and Most Unusual: Horror Films, Darrell Moore notes: \\"The film never really decided whether it wanted to be a satanic movie or a slasher movie or a mystery, and none of the many subplots, including one about Cassavetes accidentally killing his first wife, go anywhere.\\" Tom Pym, writing in 1998 for the Time Out Film Guide, favorably assessed the film, referring to it as \\"a demon-rape flick of unusually high technical ineptitude, even for this egregious genre.\\" Film scholar John Kenneth Muir called the film a \\"mildly effective horror film\\" despite its \\"incomprehensible plot,\\" resulting in a film \\"more dull than exciting in long stretches.\\" In the 2005 TLA Video & DVD Guide, the film was awarded one out of five stars, deemed \\"boring, confusing, and not very exciting.\\" Home media The Incubus was released on DVD in 2002 by Elite Entertainment. It was subsequently released on DVD by Scorpion Releasing under their Katarina's Nightmare Theater label in 2013. On October 30, 2018, Vinegar Syndrome released a region-free special edition Blu-ray of the film.

Legend surrounds The God Beast - Amok - the leader of a herd of robotic elephants (wheeldebeasts), and his return to the geographical location that another tribe now occupies - the Mekaka, led by the psychotic - yet also cunning - gorilla robot Armageddon. Armageddon's brutality and drive is explained that he operated on his own brain to remove lesser emotions which would impede his intentions to make \\"The Mekaka the greatest tribe on Earth\\". At the same time Armageddon leads his tribe to search for Amok, The God Beast is returning to the Mekaka's territory, and needing metal to facilitate repairs to himself, he attacks the Mekaka tribe, killing Armageddon's mate - Koola - and almost Armageddon's son - Ham. Only the intervention of a Novad human - Jool - (who Armageddon had unintentionally rescued earlier) prevents his destruction as well. Armageddon is in fact consumed by Amok, but he draws on the planets magnetic field and reconstitutes himself - Pumping Iron - subsequently vowing to track down and kill Amok, which he now believes to have gone rogue. After following Amok's trail they arrive at the Pits of Zinja - a long since exhausted mine, and coincidentally Jool's last home. During a three-way fight between the Mekaka, the Wheeldebeasts and the Zinja, Jool believes that The God Beast has not brought the herd to Zinja for more metal, but to kill them, as he buries them in the empty pits. To prevent this, Armageddon attacks The God Beast directly, and inadvertently hacks into his brain - releasing The Master Program into Armageddon. Breaking the fourth wall, The Master Program explains to the reader how Earth came to be, (mentioning the only date in the series - that the Earth's magnetic field cut out in the 24th Century,) and also reveals to Armageddon that The God Beast is not destroying his herd, but protecting them from an imminent asteroid shower - the Monsoon. As the asteroids start to fall, fighting is broken off and all the combatants take joint cover in the pits. As Armageddon now has ownership of The Master Program he becomes the new God Beast, Amok dies, and passes control of the herd onto Armageddon. Armageddon states that the ore in the asteroids will help him rebuild his tribe - referring to the Wheeldebeasts. The graphic novel ends with the tribe shamek Jugarjuk commenting that now Armageddon has the Wheeldebeasts as well as his own Mekaka he will indeed control the world. Jool agrees, and quotes from Pythagoras, however this does not go down with the other surviving robots as well, and they leave in disdain - all apart from Ham who is strapped to her back. Earth's magnetic field A core aspect of the graphic novel is that the Earth's magnetic field has cut out, allowing cosmic rays to bombard the planet, and rendering it uninhabitable to humanity. However, an equally important aspect of the graphic novel is Armageddon's ability to come into phase with the Earth's magnetic field and boost his own power output considerably - this is referred to as Pumping Iron and used several times throughout the novel, saving his life at least three times. The discrepancy is never clarified, despite being a potentially large plot hole.

Biography=Early career Wisit studied at the Faculty of Decorative Arts at Silpakorn University, where he was a classmate of Nonzee Nimibutr and set designer Ek Lemchuen. He started out as an art director at the Film Factory, where he worked with Pen-Ek Ratanaruang. Among television commercials directed by Wisit was a colorful commercial for Wrangler Jeans that featured Black Tiger star Chartchai Ngamsuan. Wisit continues to work at Film Factory, making commercials (particularly for the MK Restaurants hot pot chain in Thailand) in order to supplement his income in between making feature films. He also is a cartoonist and illustrator. Wisit entered the film industry as a screenwriter for two of Nonzee's films, 1997's Dang Bireley's and Young Gangsters, set in 1950s Thailand, and the ghost thriller, Nang Nak in 1999. Critically, and at the box office, the films were successes and marked the beginning of a \\"new wave\\" movement in the Thai film industry. Tears of the Black Tiger Wisit's feature-film debut was in 2000 with the colourfully audacious Tears of the Black Tiger, a genre-blending western. With a romantic melodrama at its core, the story involves outlaws, gunfights, horseback riding, comedic bits and big explosions. The film was an homage to an earlier era of Thai film - the contemplative 1950s dramas of pioneering director Rattana Pestonji as well as the \\"bomb-the-mountains, burn-the-huts\\" action films of the 1960s that starred Mitr Chaibancha. One of the leading men from the 1960s and 1970s Thai action-film era, Sombat Metanee, lent his talents to Tears of the Black Tiger, portraying the outlaw leader, Fai. Tears of the Black Tiger was the first Thai film to be screened at the Cannes Film Festival, where it was in 2001's Un Certain Regard program. At the Vancouver International Film Festival in 2000, it won the Dragons & Tigers Award for best new director. Other awards include best art direction at the Gij√≥n International Film Festival in 2001 and a jury prize at the Puchon International Fantastic Film Festival. It was also screened at the 2006 Bangkok International Film Festival as part of a tribute to Sombat Metanee. US distribution rights for the film were purchased by Miramax Films, which changed the ending and then shelved it indefinitely. In 2006, Magnolia Pictures acquired the US rights to the original version of the film, and gave it a limited theatrical run in US theaters in 2007 before releasing it on DVD. Citizen Dog Wisit's next project, 2004's Citizen Dog, was a contemporary romantic comedy set in Bankgok that proved to be even more colourful than Tears of the Black Tiger. Based on a novel written by Koynuch (Siripan Techajindawong), Wisit's long-time collaborative partner and wife, and narrated by compatriot filmmaker Pen-Ek Ratanaruang, Citizen Dog tells the tale of two rural Thai people who come to Bangkok to find work and fall in love. Critics have compared it to Jean-Pierre Jeunet's Am√©lie. Distribution rights outside Asia were purchased by Luc Besson's EuropaCorp, and it played at several film festivals, including the Berlin Film Festival, the Toronto International Film Festival and the San Francisco International Asian American Film Festival. The film screened commercially in France in 2006. The Unseeable In 2006, while he was working to develop some future projects, Wisit directed a low-budget Thai horror film for Five Star Production called The Unseeable (). The Unseeable marked a change for Wisit, who was restrained by budgetary concerns from the stylizations of his first two films. Additionally, The Unseeable was the first film that he directed but did not write, with the screenplay by Kongkiat Khomsiri, one of the \\"Ronin Team\\" credited with directing the hit Thai horror thriller, Art of the Devil 2. While the color palette was considerably muted, compared to Tears of the Black Tiger and Citizen Dog, Wisit was still able to leave his nostalgic imprint on The Unseeable by making it an homage to films of the 1930s and the stars of that era, including Bette Davis and Joan Crawford. Thai pop culture influences came from illustrator Hem Vejakorn, who wrote a series of 10-satang graphic novel ghost stories in the 1930s and '40s. The reference was so striking that the Barom Khru Foundation, which claims to supervise Hem's works, issued a statement warning Five Star Production to not violate the copyright of Hem's work. However, Wisit said the film was not an adaptation of any of Hem's works but was generally inspired by Hem's style.,Rithdee, Kong. November 3, 2006. \\"Vintage affair\\", Bangkok Post.Rithdee, Kong. November 3, 2006. \\"The carnival of souls\\", Bangkok Post. which completed shooting in August 2006 and was released on November 2, 2006. In addition to a release in Thailand, The Unseeable also had wide theatrical releases in Malaysia and Singapore, and screened at several film festivals, including the Brussels International Festival of Fantasy Film, 2007 Bangkok International Film Festival (ASEAN competition) and the Cinemanila International Film Festival. Also in 2006, Pen-Ek became the third recipient of the Silpathorn Award for Filmmaking, an honor given to contemporary Thai artists by the Ministry of Culture's Office of Contemporary Art and Culture. Norasinghavatar, Red Eagle In 2007, Wisit participated in the Short Films Project in Commemoration of the Celebration on the Auspicious Occasion of His Majesty the King's 80th Birthday Anniversary, in which nine short films were made in honor of King Bhumibol Adulyadej. Other directors participating the project included fellow Silpathorn Award winners Pen-Ek Ratanaruang and Apichatpong Weerasethakul and veteran filmmaker Bhandit Rittakol.Reigning light, The Nation (Thailand); retrieved 2007-11-19 Wisit contributed Norasinghavatar, which featured his trademark colorful and highly stylized imagery, with a blend of khon masked dance and Thai two-handed swordplay. Though the film appears to be 3D animation, it is actually live action, but completely stylized with super-saturated colors in post-production.Five stills from Wisit Sasanatieng's Norasinghavatar, Twitchfilm.net; retrieved 2007-11-14. Wisit was given a budget of 400,000 baht (about US$10,000), but his project's cost ballooned to 3 million, due to the special effects and post-production costs. \\"It's a bad habit ‚Äì I can't control the money,\\" he said in an interview. Also in 2007, at the American Film Market, it was announced that Wisit's next project for Five Star Production would be Red Eagle, a reboot of a 1960s Thai film series that starred Mitr Chaibancha as a masked superhero crimefighter. The film series ended in tragedy when Mitr was killed in 1970 during the making of Golden Eagle. The new film was reportedly to begin production in March 2008 and would star Ananda Everingham in the title role.AFM: Fresh works from Wisit's Red Eagle, Twitchfilm.net; retrieved 2007-11-14 Projects in development In 2005, when Luc Besson's EuropaCorp picked up Citizen Dog for distribution, the company also agreed to co-produce with Five Star Production a long-gestating project by Wisit called Nam Prix, which takes its name after red chilies used in Thai cooking. A historical fantasy about Thai pirates, the project began in 1998 as a one-page brief, but was shelved due to financial difficulties. While Citizen Dog was told in the contemporary style of filmmaking, and Tears of the Black Tiger portrayed an old Thai film style, Wisit has said he will endeavor to go back even further with Nam Prix, capturing the tradition of Thai temple painting and bring it to life. \\"It will be an antique Thai legend, with very traditional Thai pictures like the old wall painting. But we will animate them,\\" he was quoted as saying on ThaiCinema.org. \\"We will make them move. It is not an epic, but a folklore in order to tell our roots, our culture.\\"Chaiworaporn, Anchalee (June 23, 2005) \\"EuropaCorp to distribute Citizen Dog, co-produce Wisit‚Äôs next project\\", ThaiCinema.org. Retrieved December 28, 2005. As of 2007, pre-production work had been completed on Nam Prix, with Five Star Production awaiting Besson's EuropaCorp to provide its 50% of the budget needed to get filming under way. In March 2006 another project was announced for Wisit: a Chinese-language martial arts film called Armful, which is a revenge tale about a man who loses his arm. A gifted illustrator and comic-book artist, Wisit produced conceptual poster art for the film, which he said would be influenced by Hong Kong action cinema of the 1960s and 1970s, particularly the One-Armed Swordsman films and Master of the Flying Guillotine featuring Jimmy Wang Yu as a one-armed fighter.Frater, Patrick (March 2006). \\"Thai helmer tries on Singapore tale\\".

It existed until 1945 and then became a general high school after the occupation of Lower Silesia by Poland.  History  The duke of Liegnitz, George Rudolf (‚Ä† 1653) of the Piast dynasty, died childless. He left in his will of 1646 substantial means for the establishment a school for noble Protestant boys from Silesia, placed under the administration of the Liegnitz Johanniskirche through the Johannisstiftung. After the death of his great-nephew George William I of Liegnitz Brieg Wohlau (born 1660, duke 1672-1675), the last governing Piast, his territory was taken over by the Habsburgs as part of the Counter- reformation which forced Catholicism on the people of Silesia. The assets of the Johannisstiftung were taken by the emperor and the Johanniskirche was handed over to Jesuits. Only after Altranstaedter convention of 1708 were the assets of the Johannisstifung again released for a new school for the aristocracy, in equal numbers for boys of both denominations. The main building of the Ritter-Akademie was built in the years 1726 - 1738 in the baroque style to the design of the architect Joseph Emanuel Fischer von Erlach. The pupils wore a blue uniform with yellow collar and yellow cuffs, with blue-yellow garrison cap, but no weapon. In 1811 the academy was opened to non-aristocrats, and by 1901 it became a national school existing until 1945.

In recent years, the KitKatClub has tended to be less unruly. Enjoying music and dancing are now more important to the guests than coitus with their fellow patrons. The guests are not only heterosexual, a large number of homosexual people also spend their weekends in the club, allowing a high level of diversity amongst the clubbers. Through the years the KitKatClub has become a notorious Berlin institution. The club as it appears today (at Br√ºckenstra√üe) The club moved four times since its opening in 1994. It opened in Glogauer Stra√üe in the Kreuzberg district in the former Turbine. In 1999 it moved to one of the biggest nightlife regions of Berlin, Neues Schauspielhaus at Nollendorfplatz. In 2001, it moved to another lot in the district Tempelhof (which became part of Sch√∂neberg in the year 2000) in Bessemer Stra√üe. At the beginning of July 2007 it moved to the SageClub in the Mitte district (Br√ºckenstra√üe 1), very close to the techno club Tresor. It could be considered a noteworthy change in Berlin's clubbing landscape as Berghain, Tresor and KitKatClub now are located very close to each other. When the KitKat opened its doors in 1994 the musical profile of the club was mainly classical trance mixed with goa trance, but through the years the owners have opened the club to a much larger choice of electronic music. Some guests refer to the musical style that has developed as the \\"KittySound\\". To give this style a platform, a KitKat record label was founded in 2005 and two CDs were released, Hedonistic Nightlife in Berlin and The Piep Show Compilation #0. The KitKatClub Berlin celebrated its 20th anniversary on March 1, 2014. At that time a novel about the early years of KitKat was published under the same name ‚ÄûKitKatClub‚Äú Interview with Vigor Calma (german language), written by Vigor Calma. In 2019, a new edition of the novel appeared under the title \\"Rausch in Berlin\\" (german language only)Vigor Calma: Rausch in Berlin. Publisher.: Vigor Calma. 4. Auflage. 2019, , S. 475.. After the closing and the loss of any income due to the pandemic the KitKatClub set up a website to support the club and transmitting streams live from the location.  Name origin  The name KitKatClub is inspired by the frivolous Berliner nightclub featured in the American musical Cabaret. Harold Prince‚Äôs Cabaret was set in Berlin in the early 1930s, against the backdrop of the ascent of the Nazi party, at a burlesque theater called the \\"Kit Kat Club\\". The name originated from the Kit- Cat Club, an 18th-century English liberal political society.

Biography Stone's parents were Reverend Elijah Stone, a Methodist minister, and Sophia Creighton. In 1876, Stone, who started out as a reporter, founded the first Chicago penny paper, the Chicago Daily News. In 1881, he established the Chicago Morning News (renamed the Chicago Record). Stone became general manager of the reorganized Associated Press in 1893, and under his direction it became one of the great news agencies. He retired in 1921. Stone died of hardening of the arteries in 1929. Legacy Stone's son, Herbert Stone, married Mary Grigsby McCormick in 1900 and perished in the sinking of the luxury liner RMS Lusitania in 1915. His wife was daughter of William Grigsby McCormick of the McCormick family which included her uncle Robert Sanderson McCormick who married the daughter of the founder of the rival newspaper Chicago Tribune. Another son, Melville Elijah Stone, Jr., also predeceased him but he was survived by his wife, the former Martha McFarland of Chicago, whom he married on November 25, 1869, and his daughter Elizabeth Creighton Stone. Stone's brother was the astronomer Ormond Stone. A Liberty ship is named in his honor. The penny myth On the March 3, 2008 edition of The Rest of the Story, Paul Harvey, Jr. (substituting for his more famous father) related the story of Stone being responsible for the common use of pennies. The Chicago Daily News was not an initial success, as pennies were not widely used in 1876. According to Harvey, Stone convinced local merchants that employee theft could be reduced if the price of item was sold for 99¬¢ instead of $1.00 etc., forcing employee to make change for sales and less likely to steal money since it required further calculation. Merchants began experimenting with a penny price drop in their goods, meeting with success among their patrons. An increase in pennies, thought Stone, would help the circulation of his penny paper. When merchants began running low on pennies, Stone purchased several barrels of pennies from the Mint, further increasing their use within the Chicago area. This story is also related in Scot Morris' The Book of Strange Facts and Useless Information, though there is some doubt as to its veracity.

The team currently plays in the . History Waltham Abbey Youth Club, based in Waltham Abbey, first played football at ‚ÄúCapershotts‚Äù during the Second World War and in later years the club became known as firstly Waltham Abbey, then Abbey Sports. Both clubs gained numerous honours in the Northern Suburban League. The club was founded in 1944 with a mix of players from Waltham Abbey Youth Club and former juniors from Tottenham Hotspur under the leadership of the trainer and manager Wally Hickman. The secretary was Mo (Maurice) Ward. The President was Capt. Larkin. In their early years they played to a high standard and reached the final of the Herts Junior Cup in three years out of four but lost on each occasion ‚Äì including a loss to Redbourn Rovers of 4‚Äì5 after they had been leading 4‚Äì1. Some of the leading players in the early years included left winger Dave Cook who was killed in a road crash, centre- half Robbo Robinson and inside forward Frank Blower. Frank later became a dedicated treasurer of the club with Ray Buck as a similarly dedicated club secretary. Waltham Abbey United emerged in the late sixties and a new clubhouse was built. In 1974 the club amalgamated with the successful Beechfield Sports and joined the Metropolitan League, which later became the London Spartan League. In 1976 the club won the Essex Junior Cup beating Maldon St Mary's 1-0 at Grays Athletics ground. Alfie Hall was the goalscorer. Later that summer the club dropped the Beechfield Sports tag on the advice of The FA. Two years later the club reached the final of the Essex Intermediate Cup (losing 1-2 to Dagenham Reserves at Epping Town FC) and won the league's Division One title, and, having gained Senior Status, were promoted. In their first season they won the title without losing a game and were again promoted this time to the Premier Division where they remained until season 2000‚Äì01. In 1990‚Äì91 the club were inaugural finalists in the Roy Bailey Memorial Trophy, a competition for local teams including Cheshunt, Ware, and Hertford Town. It was won for the first time in 1994‚Äì95 when they beat Hoddesdon Town. In both 1996‚Äì97 and 2005 (in the final held over from the previous season) they beat St Margaretsbury. In 1998‚Äì99 they won the London Senior Cup with a fine 3‚Äì2 win over Bedfont at Dulwich Hamlet‚Äôs ground, Dean Green securing a hat trick to win the cup. They also secured the Spartan South Midlands Challenge Trophy beating Holmer Green 3-0 over two legs. Recent seasons have seen a lot of changes on and off the pitch with floodlights being installed in 1990 and the ground levelled. A great amount of work has been done around the clubhouse and a 200-seater stand built. A number of seats were purchased from Maine Road and these were installed during the summer of 2005 as the club strived to improve facilities on and off the field and move up the non-league pyramid. Season 2001‚Äì02 was spent in the Essex & Herts Border Combination to allow them to move across the pyramid. They were elected to the Essex Senior League for season 2002‚Äì03. In 2004‚Äì05, in addition to winning both the League Cup and the Gordon Brasted Memorial Trophy they finished in their highest position of 2nd. On 2 May 2009, the Abbott's capped off a successful 2008‚Äì09 season by beating Concord Rangers 5‚Äì4 on penalties, after a 1‚Äì1 draw, to win the Isthmian League Division 1 North Play-offs. They played in the Isthmian League Premier Division for the first time in their history in 2009‚Äì10. However, despite winning the last two games of their season, they finished 21st and were relegated for the first time in the club's history. After 7 seasons in North Division a league restructure saw the club have been moved into the newly formed Isthmian League South Central League.

During this period, MacPlay published notable games including Wolfenstein 3D, Out of this World, the Alone in the Dark series, and the Descent series. Due to the mid-to-late 1990s decline in the Mac market, Interplay exited the Macintosh games market and abandoned the MacPlay division in late 1997, with Fallout being the final release of this incarnation. In 2000, United Developers LLC licensed the MacPlay brand name from Interplay for use as the name of a wholly owned subsidiary corporation. Ron Dimant became CEO of this new incarnation of MacPlay, which was headquartered in Dallas, Texas. In the early 2000s, MacPlay published two lines of games- regular games and \\"value\\" games. Notable games published during this period included Baldur's Gate II, Majesty: The Fantasy Kingdom Sim, and the first two games in the Fallout series. The last game published by MacPlay was Tron 2.0 in June 2004. United Developers continues to hold the rights to the MacPlay name.

He has also been linked to the leader of the peasant's army that fought against the Turks in the Battle of Kokovo in July 1478. A number of folk poems and stories about King Matja≈æ are known, the earliest ones originating in the western Slovene area of Tolmin from the 16th century. He is mainly represented as the king who is just and a defender of his people, and the bringer of the golden age of prosperity. It has been assumed that the legend was the basis for the name of the 1573 peasants' revolt leader Matija Gubec, actually named Ambro≈æ Gobec.  Content of the poems and stories  The folk poems tell about King Matja≈æ's fights with the Turks, about the kidnapping of his wife Alenƒçica, or his rescue from the Turkish jail. The stories about King Matja≈æ are arrangements of the poems or may have a different content. In this case, they tell about the King's rebellion against God and about his army, buried under a mountain. Traditions and memorials The traditions related to the King Matja≈æ have a significant role in the Slovenian Carinthia, particularly the ƒårna Valley, where a competition in building snow castles as well as visual art and literary writing related to King Matja≈æ takes place every January since 1993. This is related to a story, according to which King Matja≈æ sleeps in the Peca Mountain above the valley. In the vicinity of the Peca hut, there is a bronze sculpture of King Matja≈æ in the beginning of an abandoned pit. It was designed by the sculptor and mountaineer Marjan Ker≈°iƒç in 1958, put to bronze by the sculptor France Rotar, and placed in the cave in 1962. In the mid-1990s, King Matja≈æ has been depicted on the King of Diamonds card of the Slovene Tarock. The depiction was based on a study led by the ethnologist Janez Bogataj, and the card was drawn by the academy-trained painter and illustrator Matja≈æ Schmidt. In the year 2006 Slovenian country musician Milan Peƒçovnik - Pid≈æi spotted the image of King Matja≈æ carved into the rocks of mount Peca. ReferencesExternal links * Gradovi Kralja Matja≈æa 2010.

There are parallels to the Early Kurgan culture. Cremation was practised. Painted pottery was introduced. Tin-based bronze became predominant. Geographical interconnectedness and links with other areas of the Near East are seen in many aspects of the culture. For example, a cauldron found in Trialeti is nearly identical to the one from Shaft Grave 4 of Mycenae in Greece. The Trialeti culture shows ties with the highly developed cultures of the ancient world, particularly with the Aegean,Trialeti culture but also with cultures to the south and east. Trialeti-Vanadzor painted monochrome and polychrome pottery is very similar to that in the other areas of the Near East. In particular, similar ceramics are known as Urmia ware (named after Lake Urmia in Iran). Also, similar pottery was produced by the Uzarlik culture, and the Karmirberd-Sevan culture. The site at Trialeti was originally excavated in 1936‚Äì1940 in advance of a hydroelectric scheme, when forty-six barrows were uncovered. A further six barrows were uncovered in 1959‚Äì1962.The Peoples of the Hills: Ancient Ararat and Caucasus. Charles Burney and David Marshall Lang p 90- 96. Related kurgans Martqopi kurgans are somewhat similar, and are contemporary to the earliest among the Trialeti kurgans. Together, they represent the early stage of the Early Kurgan culture of Central Transcaucasia. This Early Kurgan period, known as Martkopi-Bedeni, has been interpreted as a transitional phase and the first stage of the Middle Bronze Age.The Beginnings of Metallurgy Burial practises The Trialeti culture was known for its particular form of burial. The elite were interred in large, very rich burials under earth and stone mounds, which sometimes contained four-wheeled carts. Also there were many gold objects found in the graves. These gold objects were similar to those found in Iran and Iraq. They also worked tin and arsenic.Edens, page 56 This form of burial in a tumulus or \\"kurgan\\", along with wheeled vehicles, is the same as that of the Kurgan culture which has been associated with the speakers of Proto-Indo-European. In fact, the black burnished pottery of especially early Trialeti kurgans is similar to Kura-Araxes pottery.Edens page 58 In a historical context, their impressive accumulation of wealth in burial kurgans, like that of other associated and nearby cultures with similar burial practices, is particularly noteworthy.Edens page 59 This practice was probably a result of influence from the older civilizations to the south in the Fertile Crescent.Edens, see generally The Trialeti pottery style is believed to have developed into the Late Bronze Age Transcaucasian ceramic ware found throughout much of what is now eastern Turkey. This pottery has been connected to the expansion of the Mushki. pp. 260-261  See also  *Kura-Araxes culture *Shulaveri-Shomu culture *Prehistoric Armenia *Prehistoric Georgia  References External links *Middle Bronze Age, Trialeti Culture, South Caucasus - collection of articles at academia.edu Category:Archaeological cultures of West Asia Category:Bronze Age cultures of Asia Category:Archaeological cultures in Armenia Category:Archaeological cultures in Georgia (country) Category:Prehistoric sites in Georgia (country) Category:Prehistoric Georgia (country) Category:Indo-European archaeological cultures ","title":"Trialeti culture"},{"id":"3549644","text":"APOEL (; short for ŒëŒ∏ŒªŒ∑œÑŒπŒ∫œåœÇ Œ†ŒøŒ¥ŒøœÉœÜŒ±ŒπœÅŒπŒ∫œåœÇ ŒåŒºŒπŒªŒøœÇ ŒïŒªŒªŒÆŒΩœâŒΩ ŒõŒµœÖŒ∫œâœÉŒØŒ±œÇ, Athletikos Podosferikos Omilos Ellinon Lefkosias, \\"Athletic Football Club of Greeks of Nicosia\\") is a major multi-sport club based in Nicosia, Cyprus. APOEL, which was founded in 1926, is the most popular sports club in Cyprus and one of the most successful, achieving to win 165 official senior titles in several sports. The club is parent to fourteen different competitive departments including football, basketball, volleyball, futsal, handball, table tennis, bowling, cycling, archery, swimming, water polo and a runners team. History=The early years The club was formed as POEL (, Podosferikos Omilos Ellinon Lefkosias, Football Club of Greeks of Nicosia) on 8 November 1926. The club's formation came about when a group of forty people, with a common vision, met and set the foundations for creating a football club that would represent the Greek residents of the capital and express their deep desire for Cyprus' incorporation (enosis) into Greece. The meeting took place at a traditional confectionery, owned by Charalambos Hadjioannou, downtown in Ledra Street and the first president of the club was Giorgos Poulias. The first clubhouse was the \\"Athenians Club\\" () at the end of Ledra Street. After a journey to the football club in Alexandria, Egypt in 1927 the General Assembly of 1928 decided the players showed that they were not just good footballers but also excellent track and field athletes. Hence it was decided to create a track and field team in addition to the football team. The name APOEL was adopted to reflect this, with the 'A' standing for 'Athletic'. Soon after more sports departments were established, including volleyball, table tennis, rugby football, boxing, cycling, field hockey and basketball (a few years later). Also the club issued a sports newspaper, the \\"Athlitiki Echo\\", the first Cypriot sport newspaper. The foundation of CFA and the club's first ever official title Cyprus did not have any country-wide league until 1932. Football clubs of the time played friendly matches only. In 1932, Pezoporikos Larnaca organised an unofficial league, the first island-wide league, and it was won by APOEL after defeating AEL Limassol in the final by 4‚Äì0. In 1934, there was a disagreement between Trust and Anorthosis Famagusta on the organisation of the fourth unofficial league. APOEL and AEL Limassol organised a meeting for the foundation of a country-wide governing body and an official country-wide league. The meeting took place in APOEL's clubhouse on 23 September and the establishment of the Cyprus Football Association was agreed. Two years later the APOEL football team celebrated its first championship title of the official Cyprus football league. The 1948 conflicts Politics, however, would soon spark conflict within the team. On 23 May 1948 the board of the club send a telegram to the Hellenic Association of Amateur Athletics (), with the opportunity of the annual Panhellenic Track and Field Competition, which included wishes that \\"the rebellion\\" is finished. Several leftist club members perceived the telegram as a political comment on the Greek Civil War and they distanced themselves from the club. A few days later, on 4 June 1948, they founded Omonia, which until today is the arch rival of APOEL and there has been a traditional animosity between the fans of the two teams. 1955‚Äì59 period More conflicts led to further struggles for APOEL. Athletes belonging to the club frequently participated in national clashes. During the 1955‚Äì59 national uprising against the British, many of APOEL's athletes and members of the club were active members of EOKA (the National Organisation of Cypriot Fighters), the most outstanding example being the club's track and field athlete Michalakis Karaolis who was hanged by the British colonial authorities. During this period the football team had their closest brush with relegation as most football players were actively taking part in the national struggle. The formation of APOEL FC Company APOEL Football (Public) Ltd was established in May 1997, after the decision of APOEL committee. This had a significant effect on the club because it separated the activities of the football team from those of the sports club. The formation of the company was necessitated by the financial difficulties the team faced at the time. The company began its operations with a capital of CY ¬£600,000. The company's main activity is the management, operation and commercial exploitation of APOEL Football Club. The company owns all the rights for the football department under an agreement with APOEL sports club and pays the club CY¬£100,000 annually for the privilege. The agreement between the company and the club is renewed every five years. The company has 1745 shareholders and besides the football club, also maintains a team boutique (Orange Shop), the APOELFC () magazine and the apoelfc.com.cy website among others. Colours and badge Champions League match against Chelsea. APOEL's colours are blue and yellow. Blue symbolizes Greece and yellow symbolizes Byzantium. The logo is a blue and yellow shield with the name of the club written diagonally in blue. The football club badge has a small difference on it. The bage has remained the same since the establishment of the club, but after the football team of APOEL won their 20th championship (2008‚Äì09 season), two stars were added above the football club's logo to symbolize the 20 championship titles (one star for every ten championships won). Supporters APOEL fans celebrating after eliminating Wis≈Ça Krak√≥w and reached the Champions League group stage. APOEL is the most popular team in Cyprus. APOEL fans are right- wing in their majority but there are no strong ties between the organised fans and any political party. That wasn't always the case but during the past years they have actively avoided association with any political party. The main supporter group is PAN.SY.FI (). PAN.SY.FI was founded in 1979 and has branches in all major cities in Cyprus and also in other countries. The PAN.SY.FI (and most ultras) wear orange jackets (or T-shirts). The first game they sported the orange jackets was during the first round game of the 1992‚Äì93 championship against AEL Limassol in Makario Stadium. APOEL have reserved the shirt number 79 in honour of PAN.SY.FI. (APOEL Ultras), to denote the year the group was founded, 1979. Stadiums APOEL football club's home ground since 23 October 1999, is the 22,859 seater GSP Stadium. It is the largest stadium in Cyprus and they share it with local rivals Omonia and Olympiakos Nicosia. Before moving to GSP Stadium, APOEL used as home grounds the Makario Stadium (from 1978 until 1999) and the old GSP Stadium (prior to 1978). The club's basketball, volleyball and futsal teams host their matches in the 2,100 seater Lefkotheo Indoor Arena which was built in 1980. For many years the basketball team used as home venue the 6,000 capacity Eleftheria Indoor Hall. 1926 - APOEL's official magazine 1926 is the official magazine of the multi-sports club APOEL.ŒúœÄŒπœÑœåŒΩ, ŒúœÄŒ≠Œ∫ŒºŒ±ŒΩ, ŒõŒ≠ŒπŒªŒ± Œ†ŒØŒΩœÑŒø Œ∫Œ±Œπ ŒßœÅœçœÉŒ∑œÇ ŒúŒπœáŒ±ŒÆŒª œÉœÑŒø ŒΩŒ≠Œø œÄŒµœÅŒπŒøŒ¥ŒπŒ∫œå œÑŒøœÖ ŒëŒ†ŒüŒïŒõ A Cyprus monthly sports magazine published in Nicosia, it was founded in 2013 with its first edition appearing on 7 March 2013.

The main focus is on football, since that sport is the most popular in Cyprus. Presidential history APOEL has had numerous presidents over the course of their history.
