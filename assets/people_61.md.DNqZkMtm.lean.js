He was cast in many notable films alongside major film stars throughout his Hollywood years. Early years George Bancroft in Berlin (1929) Bancroft was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, in 1882. He attended Tomes Institute in Port Deposit, Maryland. Maritime work After working on merchant marine vessels at age 14, Bancroft was an apprentice on and later served on and West Indies. Additionally, during the Battle of Manila Bay (1898), he was a gunner on . During his days in the Navy, he staged plays aboard ship. In 1900, he swam underneath the hull of the battleship to check the extent of the damage after it struck a rock off the coast of China. For this, he was appointed to the United States Naval Academy, but found it too restrictive for his tastes and left to pursue a theatrical career.The reference work American Classic Screen Profiles says of Bancroft, \\"He left the Academy after one year for a theatrical career.\\"  Acting career  In 1901, Bancroft began acting in earnest, as he toured in plays and had juvenile leads in musical comedies. In vaudeville, he did blackface routines and impersonated celebrities. His Broadway credits include the musical comedies Cinders (1923) and The Rise of Rosie O'Reilly (1923). One of his early films was The Journey's End (1921). Bancroft's first starring role was in The Pony Express (1925), and the next year he played an important supporting role in a cast including Wallace Beery and Charles Farrell in the period naval widescreen epic Old Ironsides (1926), then went from historical pictures to the gritty world of the underground in Paramount Pictures productions such as von Sternberg's Underworld (1927) and The Docks of New York (1928). He was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actor in 1929 for Thunderbolt,The Academy Awards Database provides this comment: \\"[NOTE: THIS IS NOT AN OFFICIAL NOMINATION. There were no announcements of nominations, no certificates of nomination or honorable mention, and only the winners (*) were revealed during the awards banquet on April 3, 1930.

It is the capital and largest city of Somaliland. The city later succeeded Berbera as the capital of the British Somaliland protectorate in 1941. Hargeisa was founded as a watering and trading stop between the coast and the interior and later became an Islamic Tariqa settlement under the leadership of Sheikh Madar and his mullahs. The city later succeeded Berbera as the capital of the British Somaliland protectorate in 1941. In 1960, the protectorate gained independence and united as scheduled days later with the Trust Territory of Somaliland (former Italian Somaliland) to form the Somali Republic (Somalia) on July 1.Encyclop√¶dia Britannica, The New Encyclop√¶dia Britannica, (Encyclop√¶dia Britannica: 2002), p.835 Hargeisa is situated in a valley in the Galgodon (Ogo) highlands, and sits at an elevation of . Home to rock art from the Neolithic period, the city is also a commercial hub for precious stone-cutting, construction, retail services and trading, among other activities. Etymology The town evolved in the latter half of the 1800s as a Qadiriyya settlement established by Sheikh Madar, near a water-stop used by nomadic stock-herders on the way to the town of Harar. It thus proposes a possible derivation of the name \\"Hargeisa\\" from the sobriquet Harar as-sagir, meaning \\"Harar the little\\" According to historian Norman Bennett, Madar named the settlement Hargeisa or Little Harar since he aspired for it to emulate the city of Harar as a center for Islamic teachings. Another etymological root for Hargeisa's name derives from the towns connection to the skins trade. Hargeisa has been a watering and trading stop between the coast and the interior, and chief amongst the goods traded were the hide skins procured from the interior to be processed in the settlement. In this etymological version, ‚ÄòHargeisa‚Äô is derived from hargageys, which means \\"place to sell hides and skins‚Äù in Somali. History =Prehistory= Rock art from the Laas Geel complex on the outskirts of Hargeisa. Numerous cave paintings from the Neolithic period are found in the Laas Geel complex, on the outskirts of Hargeisa. During November and December 2002, an archaeological survey was carried out in the area by a French team of researchers. The expedition's objective was to search for rock shelters and caves containing stratified archaeological infills capable of documenting the period when production economy appeared in this part of Somaliland (circa 5th and 2nd millennium BCE). During the course of the survey, the French archaeological team discovered the Laas Geel rock art, encompassing an area of ten rock alcoves (caves). In an excellent state of preservation, the paintings show human figures with their hands raised and facing long-horned, humpless cattle.The Journal of African Archeology Volume 1.2 (2003) Chapter 3 The rock art had been known to the area's inhabitants for centuries before the French discovery. However, the existence of the site had not been broadcast to the international community. In November 2003, a mission returned to Laas Geel and a team of experts undertook a detailed study of the paintings and their prehistoric context. Somaliland in general is home to numerous such archaeological sites, with similar rock art and/or ancient edifices such as the Dhambalin rock art. However, many of these old structures have yet to be properly explored, a process which would help shed further light on local history and facilitate their preservation for posterity.Michael Hodd, East African Handbook, (Trade & Travel Publications: 1994), p.640. =The Big commune= According to traditional poetic (gabay) oral accounts, Hargeisa was founded by the Eidagale clan as a watering and trading stop for passing nomads and caravans. It is also believed that in addition to the Eidagale, the Arap and Habr Yunis subclans were also amongst the early settlers of Hargeisa. Hargeisa continued to grow with the arrival of Sheikh Madar Shirwa, widely considered to be the founder of Hargeisa religious commune. Madar Shirwa was born in Berbera and belonged to the Nuh Ismail subdivision of the Sa‚Äôad Musa Habr Awal clan. Madar arrived in Harar to study the Islamic Sciences under the top ulema of Harar which consisted of Harari and Somali scholars. \\"The chief Ulema are the Kabir Khalil, the Kabir Yunis, and the Shaykh Jami: the two former scarcely ever quit their houses, devoting all their time to study and tuition: the latter is a Somali who takes an active part in politics. These professors teach Moslem literature through the medium of Harari, a peculiar dialect confined within the walls\\" Sheikh Khalil one of the ulema in Harar advised Sheikh Madar to establish a Qadiriyya Tariqa commune in present-day Hargeisa and spread the teachings he was taught, which lead Sheikh Madar and his companions to found the Big Commune (Jama‚Äôa weyne) of Little Harar (Hargeisa) in circa 1860. Sheikh Madar also started Sorghum plantations in the vicinity of the town to maintain self-sufficiency as well as taking care of the sick and elderly inhabitants of the growing settlement. H. Swayne, a British soldier and explorer who traversed the Somali peninsula between the 1880-1890s wrote aboute Hargeisa in his journals: > This town is built some five hundred yards from the right bank of the > Aleyadera nala, and at an elevation of thirty or forty feet above it.

In 1888, after signing successive treaties with the then ruling Somali Sultans and chiefs, the British established a protectorate in the region referred to as British Somaliland.Hugh Chisholm (ed.), The encyclop√¶dia britannica: a dictionary of arts, sciences, literature and general information, Volume 25, (At the University press: 1911), p.383. The British garrisoned the protectorate from Aden in present-day Yemen, and administered it from their British India until 1898. British Somaliland was then administered by the Foreign Office until 1905 and afterwards by the Colonial Office. Berbera, a major trading harbour on the Red Sea, was the protectorate's first capital due to its strategic importance. However, the capital was moved from Berbera to Hargeisa, and the city was granted capital status in 1941. During the East African Campaign, the protectorate was occupied by Italy in August 1940, but recaptured by the British in March 1941. The protectorate gained its independence on 26 June 1960 as the State of Somaliland, before uniting as planned days later with the Trust Territory of Somaliland (the former Italian Somaliland) to form the Somali Republic. =1960‚Äì1991= MiG monument in Hargeisa commemorating Somaliland's breakaway from the rest of Somalia during the 1980s. In the post-independence period, Hargeisa was administered as the capital of the Woqooyi Galbeed province of Somalia. Numerous new development projects were subsequently launched in the city by the Somali government. Among these initiatives was the creation of the Hargeisa Provincial Museum. It was the first museum to be established in Somalia since independence in 1960. The Hargeisa International Airport was also renovated and modernized, with the ultimate aim of equipping the facility to accommodate larger aircraft and offer more flight destinations.Economist Intelligence Unit (Great Britain), Country report: Uganda, Ethiopia, Somalia, Djibouti, (The Unit: 1986), p.43. Hargeisa campaign (Hargeisa Holocaust) Up to 90% of Hargeisa (2nd largest city of the Somali Republic) was destroyed. Dictator Siad Barre's response to the SNM attacks was of unparalleled brutality, with explicit aims of handling the \\"Isaaq problem\\", he ordered \\"the shelling and aerial bombardment of the major cities in the northwest and the systematic destruction of Isaaq dwellings, settlements and water points.The Siad Barre regime targeted civilian members of the Isaaq group specifically, especially in the cities of Hargeisa and Burco and to that end employed the use of indiscriminate artillery shelling and aerial bombardment against civilian populations belonging to the Isaaq clan.Geldenhuys, p.131 =Reconstruction= After the collapse of the Somali central government and the unilateral declaration of independence of the Republic of Somaliland, a slow process of infrastructural reconstruction subsequently began in Hargeisa and other towns in the country. Since 1991, Hargeisa has undergone a large- scale facelift. The renovations have been largely financed by local entrepreneurs, as well as Somali expatriates sending remittance funds to relatives in the region through some of the various Somali-owned money transfer operators. Most of the destroyed residential and commercial buildings have since been reconstructed, with many newer structures erected. Single- story buildings downtown are also progressively giving way to multi-story high-rises. Geography =Location and habitat= Hargeisa is located in a mountainous area, in an enclosed valley of the northwestern Galgodon (Ogo) highlands. It sits at an elevation of above sea level. Hargeisa city The city used to be surrounded by forest when it was smaller in size, but the countryside around it still has small junipers. Near Hargeisa are the fertile Sheikh and Daallo mountains, which receive large amounts of rain. South of the city is the Haud savannah (Baligubadle), which attracts many different species of wildlife to graze in the area. Hargeisa is situated near the town of Gabiley, which serves as an agricultural centre in Somaliland. That town's Allay-Baday area produces tons of tomatoes and onions each month during the rainy season. The town of Arabsiyo is also located nearby, and is noted for its lemon production. Due to its relative fertility and greenery, wild animals come to the Hargeisa area to either breed or graze on the grassland savannah. Fauna that can be found in rural sections of the city include the kudu, wild boars, Somali wild ass, warthogs, antelopes, Somali sheep, goats, camels, and many different types of birds. There are also a number of both public and private menageries. South of Hargeisa is a grassland savannah, which attracts many types of wildlife to the area, including lions and leopards.  Climate  Hargeisa has a semi-arid climate (K√∂ppen: BSh). The city generally features warm winters and hot summers. However, despite its location in the tropics, due to the high altitude Hargeisa seldom experiences either very hot or very cold weather. This is a trait rarely seen in regions with a semi-arid climates. The city receives the bulk of its precipitation between the months of April and September, averaging just under of rainfall annually. Average monthly temperatures in Hargeisa range from in the months of December and January to in the month of June. Administration House of Representatives.

Economy Hargeisa is the financial hub to many entrepreneurial industries ranging from finance, retail, imports/export warehouses to gem cutters, construction, food processing, textiles and livestock trading. Qani Abdi Alin, owner of the Dheeman clothing firm, at the launch of the Partnership Fund for local commercial ventures. In June 2012, the Partnership Fund for the private sector in the Somaliland region was launched at Hargeisa's Ambassador Hotel. Part of the larger Partnership for Economic Growth program, the initiative will see $900,000 USD allocated to 13 private local businesses, as well as the creation of 250 new full-time jobs, half of which are to be earmarked for youth and one third for women. The fund is expected to improve job opportunities for 1,300 entrepreneurs through ameliorated product distribution and investment in new technologies and processing facilities. Eligibility is determined through a competitive and transparent selection process overseen by the Partnership program, the Somaliland Chamber of Commerce, and government officials. Transportation Bus station in Hargeisa Buses are the most commonly used form of public transportation in Hargeisa. They travel on a number of routes serving nearly all of the city's districts. Intercity bus services are also available, which connect Hargeisa to other major northern Somali cities and towns, including Burao, Berbera and Borama. With the growth of urban development, several new taxi companies have sprung up in Hargeisa. Entrance to the Hargeisa International Airport Hargeisa Taxi is another of the recent taxi firms based in Hargeisa. It has a fleet of four small compact cars and seven passenger minivans, in addition to around 19 other vehicles. GPS devices installed by the Sahal Technology firm allow the cab company's dispatch office to monitor its taxis to ensure that they travel within the speed limit. The office can also disable the vehicles online in the event of theft. Other new taxi firms serving Hargeisa include Dalhis Taxi and Marodi Jeh Taxi. Fares are inexpensive, costing between 15,000 and 18,000 Somaliland shillings ($2‚Äì$3 USD) per ride, with the national Somali shilling also widely accepted. For air transportation, the city is served by the Hargeisa International Airport. The Somali-owned private carriers Daallo Airlines and Jubba Airways offer domestic flights from the facility to various other towns in Somalia, such as Mogadishu, Bosaso and Galkayo. Trips to international destinations are also available, including to Djibouti and Dubai. It has recently gained more airlines such as Ethiopian Airlines and flydubai.

He was particularly associated with various London buildings, with railway stations and cemetery projects. He was a Member of Parliament from 1855 until his death. Early life and career Tite was born in the parish of St Bartholomew the Great in the City of London, in February 1798, the son of a merchant in Russian goods named Arthur Tite. He was articled to David Laing, architect of the new Custom House, and surveyor to the Parish of St Dunstan-in-the-East. Tite assisted Laing in the rebuilding of St Dunstan's church: according to an article published in the Architect in 1869, Tite entirely designed the new building, Laing himself having no knowledge of Gothic architecture. In 1827‚Äì8 Tite built the Scottish church in Regent Square, St Pancras, London, for Edward Irving, in a Gothic Revival style, partly inspired by York Minster, and ten years later collaborated with Charles Robert Cockerell in designing the London & Westminster Bank head office in Lothbury, also in the city. Royal Exchange The Royal Exchange, c. 1855 The rebuilding of the Royal Exchange, opened in 1844, was Tite's greatest undertaking. The previous building was destroyed by fire in 1838, and a competition to design a replacement was held the following year. When this proved unproductive, a second limited competition was held between Tite, Charles Robert Cockerell, George Gwilt, Charles Barry and Robert Smirke. Tite's winning design has an imposing eight- column entrance portico, inspired by the Pantheon in Rome, while the other sides of the building are based on Italian renaissance models. Railway stations Tite was the architect for the Eastern Counties, London and Blackwall, Gravesend and South Western Railways, and in France those between Paris and Rouen and Rouen and Le Havre; an article in the Architect named the station at Rouen, spanning nearly ninety feet, as an example of his structural skill. Tite designed many of the early railway stations in Britain, including: *The termini of the London and South Western Railway at Vauxhall (Nine Elms), Southampton Terminus, Gosport and Windsor Riverside *The termini of the London and Blackwall Railway at Minories and Blackwall (1840) *Carnforth, Carlisle Citadel and Lancaster Castle railway stations (1846-1847) *The majority of the stations on the Caledonian and Scottish Central railways, including Edinburgh (1847-1848) (not built) and Perth (1847-1848) *Barnes, Barnes Bridge, Chiswick and Kew Bridge railway stations (1849) *Stations between Yeovil and Exeter, including Axminster and the now-demolished Honiton. His station at Carlisle was built in a neo-Tudor style with a frontage of about 400 feet, broken into several masses. At the centre of the fa√ßade was an arcade of five arches, with buttresses and pinnacles. The refreshment rooms had \\"an open timber roof, and oriels or bays, reminiscent of the dining-hall of olden times\\". Cemeteries Head Stone of William Tite at the Catacombs of West Norwood Cemetery July 2014. As a company director of the South Metropolitan Cemetery Company he laid out his first cemetery at Norwood in 1836 and designed several significant monuments and chapels there. While previous cemetery designs had followed a classical style, Tite's design was the first to employ the Gothic revival alongside landscaping, which was subsequently judged to be the archetype for future cemeteries.English Heritage The Register of Parks and Gardens: Cemeteries: \\"West Norwood (South Metropolitan Cemetery, 1837) saw the first cemetery buildings erected in the Gothic style (these being by William Tite) and from this point, Gothic Revival began to challenge Neo-Greek as the dominant style. By the mid 19th century, it was generally accepted that Gothic was the correct style for a Christian cemetery and for the latter part of the century onwards the great majority of cemetery buildings were in this manner\\" Between 1853 and 1854, with Sydney Smirke, he landscaped Brookwood Cemetery near Woking in Surrey for the London Necropolis Company. Maintaining his associations with railways, this cemetery was served by a dedicated train service from London Necropolis railway station, next to Waterloo station, in central London. Between 1858 and 1859 he built a memorial church in the Byzantine style at Gerrards Cross, Buckinghamshire. Later life Tite's active work as an architect ceased about twenty years before his death (in recognition of his contributions, however, he was awarded the RIBA Royal Gold Medal in 1856). In 1851 he visited Italy after a grave illness. In 1854 he stood for parliament, unsuccessfully contesting Barnstaple as a Liberal, but the following year he was returned as Member of Parliament for Bath, which he represented until his death. He keenly opposed Sir George Gilbert Scott's proposal to build the new Foreign and Commonwealth Office and other government buildings adjacent to the Treaury in Whitehall in the Gothic style. He was knighted in 1869, and was made a Companion of the Bath the next year. Tite had a wide knowledge of English literature and was a good linguist and a lover of old books. He was an elected a fellow of the Royal Society in 1835, and of the Society of Antiquaries in 1839. He was President of the Camden Society and of the Royal Institute of British Architects. He was a director of the London and Westminster Bank and Governor of the Bank of Egypt; in 1856 he was nominated a member of the Select Committee on the Bank Charter. He was a member of the Metropolitan Board of Works, a magistrate of Middlesex and Somerset and Deputy-Lieutenant for London. He was also a Governor of St. Thomas's Hospital, London, where he is commemorated by the William Tite Scholarship, for the best student in the first year, with the highest aggregate marks in Anatomy and Physiology. After over 125 years, this prize has been subsumed into King's College London, where it is still awarded for excellence in the pre-clinical medical course. He died on 20 April 1873 at Torquay and was interred in the catacombs of his South Metropolitan Cemetery.Obituary, The Architect, 26 April 1873, p. 225. Tite Street, which runs north-west from London's Chelsea Embankment, is named after him.

Widowed in 1904, Hannah Bracken had moved her family (including two stepdaughters) by 1908 to Dublin, where Brendan attended St Patrick's National School, Drumcondra, until 1910, when he was transferred to the O'Connell School, run by the Irish Christian Brothers. Distressed by his misbehaviour, his mother sent him in 1915 to Mungret College, a Jesuit boarding school in County Limerick, but he quickly bolted and ran up hotel bills. She then sent him to Australia to live with a cousin who was a priest in Echuca, Victoria. The young man led a nomadic existence in Australia, moving often but reading avidly, and becoming self-educated.Bracken profile at Oxford DNB ; accessed 26 February 2014. In 1919, Bracken returned briefly to Ireland, finding his mother settled in County Meath. He distanced himself from Ireland as well as his siblings, who were in revolt over their father's inheritance. He moved instead to settle in Liverpool. In 1920, he appeared at Sedbergh School, claiming to be a 15-year-old and an Australian, to have been orphaned in a bush fire and to have a family connection to Montagu Rendell, the headmaster of Winchester College. Without fully believing the story, Sedbergh's headmaster, impressed by the young Bracken‚Äôs depth of knowledge and eagerness to progress, accepted him. By the end of one term, his Irish republican heritage and his five formative years in Australia had blended with the elements and trappings of a British public school man. He might have had good reason to hide his Irish heritage, as the Irish War of Independence (1919‚Äì1921) had aroused hostility toward Irish people living in Great Britain. For whatever reason, that denial became a regular feature of his life. Another example occurred in 1926, when he met Major-General Emmet Dalton, a former senior commander in the new Irish Army, in London. The former British Army officer, turned IRA confidant, who was one of General Michael Collins's right- hand men, recalled meeting Bracken at national school in Dublin. Bracken denied that, but Dalton insisted that he remembered the smell of Bracken's corduroy trousers. A third example occurred during the Second World War, when Bracken told people that his brother had been killed in action at Narvik, but his brother was alive and well in Ireland and was importuning Brendan for money. Business and political career After Sedbergh, whose \\"old boy\\" tie he used to good effect, Bracken was briefly a schoolmaster at Bishop's Stortford College. He then made a successful career from 1922 as a magazine publisher and newspaper editor in London. His initial success was based on selling advertising space to at least cover the cost of each number. In the 1923 election, he assisted Winston Churchill's unsuccessful attempt to be elected as Member of Parliament (MP) for Leicester West, which began their political association. He also assisted in Churchill‚Äôs 1924 Westminster Abbey by-election campaign. In the fighting that occurred on the streets, Bracken was stabbed. Bracken himself was elected to the House of Commons in 1929 for the London constituency of North Paddington. Stanley Baldwin described Bracken as Churchill's \\"faithful chela\\", chela being the Hindi word for disciple. Many of his early magazine stories included a political flavour, and he commissioned articles from a wide range of politicians such as Churchill and Benito Mussolini. Business and politics permanently overlapped in his life, like that the career of his occasional friend Lord Beaverbrook. He needed politicians for stories, who needed the publicity given by his publications. A supporter of Churchill from 1923, who was out of Parliament and in his political wilderness, Bracken was invited to join Churchill's \\"Other Club\\". Their lives changed from the outbreak of the Second World War in 1939. In 1926, he was the founding editor of The Banker, and magazine and bankers still name their respected annual Bank of the Year awards \\"Brackens\\" in his honour.The Bank of the Year Awards\\" , The Banker The Banker features a regular column called \\"Bracken\\",\\"The Bracken Column\\" The Banker focusing on providing views and perspectives on how to improve the global financial system. =Assists in selection of Churchill= In two matters relating to Churchill, Bracken can be said to have played a key part behind the scenes. When Neville Chamberlain prepared to resign in May 1940, his successor would be Churchill or Lord Halifax. The political issue at stake at the time was the formation of a National Government, and the particular dilemma over which of Chamberlain's potential successors would be acceptable to the Labour Party. The view in Churchill's mind was that the Labour Party would not support him, and Churchill therefore agreed with Chamberlain to nominate Halifax. When Bracken became aware of Churchill's agreement to nominate Halifax, he convinced Churchill that the Labour Party would indeed support him as Chamberlain's successor and Lord Halifax's appointment would hand certain victory to Hitler. Bracken advised Churchill tactically to say nothing when the three met to arrange the succession. After a deafening silence when Churchill was expected to nominate Halifax, the latter obligingly ruled himself out, and Churchill was put forward as Britain's wartime Prime Minister, having avoided any appearance of disloyalty to Chamberlain.Lysaght, pp. 172‚Äì173 =Support from the US 1940‚Äì1941= When Churchill became Prime Minister in May 1940, Bracken helped in moving him into 10 Downing Street. Bracken was sworn into the Privy Council in 1940, despite his lack of ministerial experience, and became Churchill's parliamentary private secretary. An insight into the nature of the relationship between Churchill and Bracken is found in Churchill's history of the Second World War. Churchill wrote that he had received telegrams from Washington about Harry Hopkins \\"stating that he was the closest confidant and personal agent of the President. I therefore arranged that he should be met by Mr. Brendan Bracken on his arrival\\". The suggestion was that Churchill had arranged, as is diplomatic custom, for Hopkins to be met by the person who was his closest counterpart in British government and that Bracken often played the role of confidant and personal agent to Churchill. After Bracken met Hopkins's flight on 9 January 1941, Churchill and Hopkins forged a close association. According to Charles Lysaght's biography, Bracken and Hopkins had met in America in the late 1930s, and that personal tie helped speed the decision to assist Britain nearly a year before the US actually entered the war.Lysaght, pp. 183‚Äì184. =Minister of Information= In 1941, Bracken was promoted to the post of Minister of Information and served until 1945.Bracken Press Conference\\" 1943 photo , life.com; accessed 26 February 2014. At the same time, he was one of the heads of the Political Warfare Executive. Postwar years In 1945, after the end of the wartime coalition, Bracken was briefly First Lord of the Admiralty in the Churchill caretaker ministry, but lost the post in the general election was won by Clement Attlee's Labour Party. Bracken lost his North Paddington seat but soon returned to the Commons, as Member of Parliament for Bournemouth in a November 1945 by- election. He was a relentless critic of the Labour government's policy of nationalisation and the retreat from empire.Irish Times, 9 August 2008 At the 1950 general election, he was returned for Bournemouth East and Christchurch, a seat he held until the general election the following year. In early 1952 he was elevated to the peerage as Viscount Bracken, of Christchurch in the County of Southampton, but never used the title or sat in the House of Lords. He retired from publishing in 1956. His best-known business accomplishment was merging the Financial News into the Financial Times in 1945. The latter had been published from Bracken House, London, clad in pink stone to match the colour of the paper, just south-east of St Paul's Cathedral, which was remodelled in 1989. At that stage, he was also publishing The Economist. In 1951, with his love of history, he helped found History Today magazine. Death A heavy smoker, Bracken died of esophageal cancer on 8 August 1958, aged 57, in London.His article in the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography (Volume 7, page 147) simply states his death cause as \\"throat cancer\\". Although raised a Catholic, he refused the last rites of the Church despite efforts by his nephew, Rev Kevin Bracken, a Cistercian monk at Bethlehem Abbey, Portglenone, County Antrim, to persuade him. As he was unmarried, the viscountcy died with him. He was cremated without ceremony at Golders Green Crematorium in north London.Note cremation was formally banned by the Catholic Church until 1963, and until 1966 Catholic priests were forbidden to officiate at cremation services. His ashes were scattered on the Romney Marshes. In popular culture Bracken is featured in the 1981 TV mini series Winston Churchill: The Wilderness Years, portrayed by Tim Pigott-Smith. 2010 and 2015 television documentaries On 21 December 2010, RT√â One broadcast an hour-long TV documentary about his life entitled Brendan Bracken ‚Äì Churchill's Irishman. The programme was made by Spanish production company, Marbella Productions, in association with RT√â, and examined Bracken's life through photographs, interviews, rare archive footage and dramatic reconstructions, and told of his importance in the areas of British political and journalistic life, despite his attempt to hide from history by having all his papers burned after his death. The 2015 television documentary Churchill's Secret Son is the 90-minute version of the previous documentary Churchill's Irishman, updated by the producers including additional images, stories about Bracken's life and additional footage. The programme was transmitted on Discovery UK's History Channel on 24 January 2015 at 10pm, as part of the British History week, and coincided with the 50th anniversary of Churchill's death in 1965.

Many of her books are still in print. Early life and education Ruth Krauss was born July 25, 1901, in Baltimore, Maryland to Julius Leopold and Blanche Krauss. As a child, Ruth had numerous health problems, including the rare autoimmune disorder pemphigus. She began writing and illustrating her own stories while still a child, hand sewing her pages into books. Ruth went to a local high school but left in 1917 after her sophomore year to focus on the study of art. She enrolled in the Maryland Institute for the Promotion of the Mechanic Arts (now known as the Maryland Institute College of Art). The school's focus on applied arts did not suit her and she left after about a year. Her next stop was a girls camp, Camp Walden in Maine, where she discovered her love for writing; the camp yearbook for 1919 contains her first published piece of writing. After the camp, she spent some time studying violin in the Peabody Institute of Music's preparatory program. She was considered a gifted but undisciplined musician by her teachers. Ruth's father died in late 1921, requiring Ruth to drop out of school. She took a series of office jobs. In 1927, she decided to enroll at the Parsons School of Design in New York. Graduating from Parsons in 1929, as the Great Depression was beginning, she found it difficult to get work as an illustrator. Among the work she did find in this period was the first pictorial book jacket for the Modern Library (Alice in Wonderland, 1932). Ruth was a member of the Writers' Laboratory at the Bank Street College of Education in New York during the 1940s. In the 1930s, Ruth was married to journalist and crime novelist Lionel White; they divorced shortly before World War II. Personal life and career Ruth Krauss married children's book author Crockett Johnson in 1943. They collaborated on many books, among them The Carrot Seed, How to Make an Earthquake, Is This You? and The Happy Egg. Another eight of her books were illustrated by Maurice Sendak, starting with A Hole Is to Dig (1952), which launched Sendak's career. The Krauss-Sendak collaborations spawned a host of imitators of their \\"unruly\\" and \\"rebellious\\" child protagonists. The peculiar definitional phrasing of Krauss's writing in this book‚Äîwith sentences like \\"A party is to make little children happy\\"‚Äîbecame something of a cultural phenomenon when the book was first published and has helped to maintain its popularity. Krauss also illustrated a few of her own books. In addition to her books for children, Krauss wrote three collections of poetry and plays in verse for adults. Recognition Two books that Krauss wrote were runners-up for the prestigious Caldecott Medal, which is awarded to children's book illustrators:The Happy Day (1950) and A Very Special House (1954). Maurice Sendak characterized Krauss as a giant in the world of children's literature, saying: \\"Ruth broke rules and invented new ones, and her respect for the natural ferocity of children bloomed in to poetry that was utterly faithful to what was true in their lives\\". He honored her in the New Yorker cover illustration for Sept. 27, 1993, which shows a homeless boy using Krauss's book A Hole Is to Dig as a pillow.

Established in 1979, The Baltimore School for the Arts offers art concentrations in vocal music, instrumental music, theater acting, theater production, dance, visual arts and film. The high school has produced numerous \\"Presidential Scholars\\" in the Arts and its students have gone on to attend major conservatories and Ivy League Schools. In 2016, the BSA was named a Silver Medal School by the U.S. News and World Report magazine and was ranked 1,560th nationally and 44th in the state of Maryland (first overall in Baltimore City). History In 1979, the President of the Board of School Commissioners authored a Charter creating the Baltimore School for the Arts. In the form of a resolution of the School Board, this Charter followed many years of effort to create an arts high school, including a 1978 recommendation of a special Task Force appointed and given strong support by then Mayor William Donald Schaefer, (1921‚Äì2011), [served 1971‚Äì1986]; [later Governor of Maryland, 1987‚Äì1995, Comptroller of Maryland, 1999‚Äì2007]. The BSA was created as part of the Baltimore City Public Schools system, however the charter provided the BSA with the structure and the authority to design and implement policies and programs necessary to be successful in its mission as a pre- professional arts high school. The charter stated \\"that it differ from other Baltimore city high schools by training students with potential for careers in the performing and visual arts.\\" Mission The Baltimore School for the Arts is a school that intends to prepare its students for careers in the arts. The school provides qualified students with training in one of five arts disciplines: music (vocal/instrumental), visual arts, theatre (acting/stage design and production), dance, or film in combination with a comprehensive, college preparatory academic program. The theater and music majors are split into two groups each: for the theater department, there is both acting and Stage Design and Production, and the music department is split into vocal and instrumental. A further mission of the school is to serve as an arts resource for the Baltimore community by offering performances, educational workshops and extensive after-school training in the arts to Baltimore children. This is offered through a program called TWIGS, which is open to 2nd‚Äì8th graders. Academics The Baltimore School for the Arts is a four-year public high school that provides young people with intensive, pre-professional training in the arts within the context of a comprehensive, college preparatory academic curriculum. Working with a distinguished faculty, students pursue any one of four disciplines‚Äîthe visual arts, music (vocal or instrumental), theater (acting or theater production), dance and film‚Äîin an environment that emphasizes professionalism and scholarship. About 400 students attend the school, coming from public and private schools in and around Baltimore. Students are accepted by an audition or portfolio review only‚Äì without regard to grades or academic performance. Rising 9th and 10th graders may apply to the school.

The Sd.Kfz. 251 was designed to transport the Panzergrenadier (German mechanized infantry) into battle. Sd.Kfz. 251s were the most widely produced German half-tracks of the war, with at least 15,252 vehicles and variants produced by seven manufacturers. Some sources state that the Sd.Kfz. 251 was commonly referred to simply as \\"Hanomags\\" by both German and Allied soldiers after the manufacturer of the vehicle;Green, Michael. Anderson, Thomas. Schulz, Frank. German Tanks of World War II. Zenith Imprint, 2000. this has been questioned, and may have been only a postwar label.Jentz, Thomas. Doyle, Hilary. Panzer Tracts, # 15-2: Mittlere Schuetzenpanzerwagen (Sd.Kfz.251). Panzer Tracts, 2005. German officers referred to them as SPW (Sch√ºtzenpanzerwagen, or armored infantry vehicle) in their daily orders and memoirs. Design There were four main model modifications (Ausf√ºhrung A through D), which formed the basis for at least 22 variants. The initial idea was for a vehicle that could be used to transport a single squad of 10 panzergrenadiers to the battlefield protected from enemy small arms fire, and with some protection from artillery fire. In addition, the standard mounting of at least one MG 34 or MG 42 machine gun allowed the vehicle to provide suppressive fire for the rifle squad both while they dismounted and in combat. The armour plates were designed to provide protection against standard rifle/ machine gun bullets (like the 7.92√ó57mm Mauser bullet). The front-facing plates were 14.5mm thick; the sides were steeply angled, V-shape 8mm thick plates. This level of armour provided protection against normal (non-tungsten) rifle AP round, which could pierce about 8mm of vertical armour. Positive aspects of the open top included greater situational awareness and faster egress by the infantry, as well as the ability to throw grenades and fire over the top of the fighting compartment as necessary while remaining under good horizontal cover. The downside, as with all armored personnel carriers of the era, was a major vulnerability to all types of plunging fire; this included indirect fire from mortars and field artillery, as well as small arms fire from higher elevated positions, lobbed hand grenades, Molotov cocktails, and strafing by enemy aircraft. The first two models (ausf A and B) were produced in small numbers from 1939. Ausf A and B models can be identified by the structure of the nose armor, which comprised two trapezoidal armor panels - the lower of which had an engine cooling vent. The B model, which began production in 1940, eliminated the fighting compartment's side vision slits. The C model, which started production in mid-1942, featured a simplified hexagonal-shaped forward armored plate for the engine. Models A through C had rear doors that bulged out. The C model had a large production run, but was quite complex to build, involving many angled plates. From early 1943, the D model was developed with the purpose of halving the number of angled body plates, simplifying the design and thus speeding up the production. D models can be easily recognized by their single piece sloping rear, with flat doors. The standard personnel carrier version was equipped with a 7.92 mm MG 34 or MG 42 machine gun mounted at the front of the open compartment, above and behind the driver. A second machine gun could be mounted at the rear on an anti-aircraft mount. Variants were produced for specialized purposes, including with anti-aircraft guns, light howitzers, anti-tank guns and mortars or even large unguided artillery rockets, as well as a version with an infrared search light used to spot potential targets for associated Panther tanks equipped with infrared detectors. A strong design feature of the Sd.Kfz. 251 was the large track area, with the characteristic \\"slack track\\" design with no return rollers for the upper run of track. The Sd.Kfz. 251 also had the Schachtellaufwerk system of overlapping and interleaved main road wheels common to virtually all German halftracks of the period. This lowered the ground pressure and provided better traction, at the cost of much greater complexity in maintenance. The Sd.Kfz. 251 also had tank steering, whereby the normal steering wheel moved the front wheels, but after more turning of the steering wheel, the tracks are braked to cause turning, like on a tank. However, the interleaved and overlapping main road wheels shared a major problem with the Tiger I and Panther tanks that also used such roadwheel configurations - in muddy or winter weather conditions, such as those during a mud season (rasputitsa) or the winter conditions, accumulated mud and snow could freeze solid between the road wheels, immobilizing the vehicle. Use The early production models of this vehicle were issued to the 1st Panzer Division in 1939. These vehicles were meant to enable Panzergrenadier to accompany panzers and provide infantry support as required. In practice, there were never enough of them to go around, and most Panzergrenadier units had to make do with trucks for transport.Roger Edwards, Panzer, A Revolution in Warfare, 1939-1945, Brockhampton Press, London, UK, 1998, p. 87 In August 1943, Romania acquired a total of 27 armored half-tracks, of both the 251 and 250 types followed in 1944 by 251 type and other types of armored cars to convert two cavalry divisions into armored or mechanized divisions.ARMATA ROM√ÇNƒÇ ≈ûI EVOLU≈¢IA ARMEI TANCURI.

Nicknamed \\"Stummel\\" (\\"stump\\"). In 1944, a revised modular gun mount was introduced to facilitate production that also incorporated a coaxial MG42. This universal gun mount was also used to create the Sd.Kfz. 250/8 variant and the Sd.Kfz.234/3. *Sd.Kfz. 251/10 - Sch√ºtzenpanzerwagen (3.7 cm PaK). Equipped with a 37 mm Pak 36 anti-tank gun mount. Issued to platoon leaders as a fire support vehicle. Early versions used the whole top half of a Pak 36 with full gunshield, but later ausf.

This was in addition to the standard forward machine gun mount. Six Sd.Kfz. 251/16 Flammpanzerwagens were authorised for issue to each Panzergrenadier regiment or in the Pioneer battalion. Though vulnerable, they were used very successfully at night to quickly attack enemy infantry who had just captured German trenches, hitting the enemy before they could consolidate and bring up the heavy weapons that would make them much costlier to defeat later. Late ausf. D versions had larger gunshields. *Sd.Kfz. 251/17 - Sch√ºtzenpanzerwagen (2 cm). Anti-aircraft vehicle armed with a 2 cm KwK38 on a pedestal mounting with a small armored turret to protect the gunner.

Strong firepower, especially when organised into platoons of 6 SPW. However, with a combined rate of fire of 2000 RPM, it could fire off its full load of 3000 rounds in just 90 seconds. *Sd.Kfz. 251/22 - 7.5 cm PaK40 L/46 auf mittlerem Sch√ºtzenpanzerwagen. Fitted with a 75 mm PaK 40 anti-tank gun. Probably too big a gun for the carriage, overloaded but effective, and the Yugoslav military was still using captured examples into the 1950s. *Sd.Kfz. 251/23 - 2 cm H√§ngelafette 38 auf mittlerem Sch√ºtzenpanzerwagen. Reconnaissance variant intended to replace the Sd.Kfz. 250/9 and fitted with the same turret mounting as the Sd.Kfz. 234/1 armoured car.

This version had an air-cooled diesel engine, and an armored roof over the troop compartment. The vehicle was not liked by those who used it and was nicknamed \\"Hitler's revenge\\". Last vehicles were removed from Czech Army magazines in 1995. *Field modified variants - Various field modified variants also existed during World War II. There was a kit for installing an armoured map table in place of the forward MG34 mount in use in 1941. One interesting variant was made at the closing stages of the war, when German forces removed the armored bodies of damaged Sd.Kfz. 251s and installed them on light truck chassis, resulting in a wheeled variant of the Sd.Kfz. 251. At least two were made in this way judging by their number plates.

As a result of the Subtropical High of the Azores precipitation is concentrated in winter, making summers dry with no precipitation days during June, July and August months. It is the sunniest place in Europe and with the highest number of radiation: between 1800 and 1900 kWh/m¬≤ (ideal for solar panels), values closer to North Africa and the Middle East. Demographics There are only a small number of year-round residents of Gavdos and services for tourists are basic. , the total population of Gavdos was 152. In reality, fewer than 50 people live permanently on the island. In the summer the total people on the island can reach over 3,500, most of whom are campers and tourists. The largest man-made harbour is at Karave. The island's capital is Kastri. The southernmost populated village is Vatsiana, with a total permanent population of 31 people. Fokia (with Korfos beach area), Ampelos and the area around Sarakiniko beach are the other main populated places. History The concrete chair on Gavdos (Cape Tripiti) that symbolizes the southernmost point of Europe. Gavdos has supported a permanent population since Neolithic times and the Bronze Age. Gavdos has been identified as a possible site of the mythical Ogygia where Kalypso held Odysseus prisoner. Archaeological evidence showed that the Roman empire was active on the island. During that time the flora of the island was overexploited and that started a process of erosion which has continued to this day. Gavdos, under the name of Cauda, was briefly referenced in the Bible's New Testament in the book of Acts. In chapter 27 whilst Paul is a prisoner being transported to Rome by ship they encounter a storm, in verse 16 it reads \\"As we passed to the lee of a small island called Cauda, we were hardly able to make the lifeboat secure...\\". (NIV Version) They eventually shipwrecked in Malta. Gavdos had approximately 8,000 inhabitants by 900 AD. During the Ottoman Empire's reign on the island, which lasted from 1665 until 1895, Gavdos was known as Gondzo. During this period the population decreased considerably to only 500 by 1882. A reference to Saracens on the island survives: the beach Sarakiniko (\\"of the Saracens\\"). In the 1930s the island was used as a place of exile of communists; more than 250 people were exiled including leading figures of the Greek movement, such as Markos Vafiadis and Aris Velouchiotis. During World War II, Allied forces evacuated some forces to Gavdos following the German victory in the battle of Crete. Gavdos was then occupied by the Axis powers from June 1941 until liberation in October 1944. Later on, the general phase of urbanization that started in other parts of Greece in the 1960s took place in the 1950s on Gavdos. During that period the islanders exchanged their land on Gavdos with ex-Turkish land on Crete, which had now become exchangeable via the state.? Upon settling in Crete they created a community known as Gavdiotika, which is part of the town of Paleochora. Economy There are many abandoned terraces on Gavdos where farmers used to grow crops on the hillsides. There still is some agriculture on Gavdos. During the summer, the population of the island swells to a few thousand because of tourists, although there are few facilities for tourists. There is one year-round cafe in Carave (Karabe) on Gavdos run by Evangelina Tsigonakis. There is a modern non-functioning reproduction lighthouse tower on Gavdos which now serves as a cafe during the summer season; the complex also contains a museum on the history of the original lighthouse with several rooms of photos and antique equipment. Gavdos has an FM radio station, Gavdos FM 88.8, which is also available online.Gavdosfm homepage A beach on the northern part of the island. Transport Ferries connect the port of Karave with those of Paleochora, Sougia, Agia Roumeli, Loutro and H√≥ra Sfak√≠on. There is a heliport in the northern part of the island. Bus services connect the island's main locations. The island's road network is a mixture of paved, unsurfaced and dirt roads. Politics Following years of isolation, in 1996 the island came to media prominence. In a NATO exercise Gavdos was the focal point of a confrontation between Greece and Turkey. Following that, Prime Minister Costas Simitis visited Gavdos and announced a five-year, ‚Ç¨1.5 million plan for the island's development. In 2001, Costis Stephanopoulos, the Greek President, inaugurated a telemedicine centre on Gavdos, an island which has not had a full-time doctor in recent memory. This effort, however, was marred as the island's infrastructure could not provide the necessary power required by the centre. For the purposes of the inauguration, generators were brought in, which were then removed. However, according to a 2008 BBC News report the island now features stable electrical power, and young medical graduates can serve for six months on Gavdos in lieu of compulsory military service. But visitors to Gavdos in June 2008 found that the power station was not functioning and that businesses were relying on gas generators operated for a few hours per night; locals stated that the power station worked initially, but no longer serves the entire island reliably. In 2002, the island was in the news again, due to the arrests of members of the extremist Marxist group 17 November. The leader of this organization had been living openly for several years on Gavdos as a beekeeper.The Med's 'forgotten' island: It is hard to imagine a more spectacular edge of a continent, John Pickford, BBC News, January 24, 2008.

Uses Some movie studios build a wide variety of sets on the backlot, which can be modified for different purposes as need requires and \\"dressed\\" to resemble any time period or look. These sets include everything from mountains, forests, ships, to small-town settings from around the world, as well as streets from the Old West, to whole modern-day city blocks from New York City, Paris, Berlin, and London. There are streets that comprise an assortment of architectural styles, Victorian to suburban homes, and 19th century-style townhouses that encircle a central park with trees. An example of this is (the former) Columbia Ranch in Burbank, California seen in the title sequence of Friends or, in the case of Universal Studios, the home of Norman Bates from the Hitchcock movie Psycho. The shells, or fa√ßades, on a studio backlot are usually constructed with three sides and a roof, often missing the back wall and/or one of the side walls. The interior is an unfinished space, with no rooms, and from the back of the structure one can see the electrical wires, pipes, beams and scaffolding, which are fully exposed. Ladders are usually built into the structure, allowing performers to climb to an upper-floor window or the roof to perform scenes. Not all the buildings and houses are shells. Some are closed in with a fourth wall. When not otherwise in use, they serve as storage facilities for lighting and other production equipment. When in use, the structures are dressed by adding doors, window treatments and landscaping. L-shaped temporary walls are placed inside of doors to give the illusion of an interior. When not in use, the structures are usually stripped of this dressing. Mel Brooks' Blazing Saddles offers a rare look into the Warner Bros. backlot, with scenes spilling off the Laramie Street set into various stages and eventually out of Gate 3 onto Olive Avenue in Burbank, California. Television shows such as Moonlighting and It's Garry Shandling's Show also broke the fourth wall and gave audiences a peek of life on the other side of the camera. All the sets on a studio backlot are built to appear large, as if covering miles of ground on the big or small screen, while actually occupying only a few acres of the backlot. At their peak, some backlots covered hundreds of acres around existing studios, and filmmakers rarely left the lot, as they would intercut the backlot shots with a handful of establishing shots filmed on location by a second unit. Demise Today many studio backlots are gone or nearly gone. There are several reasons for this. Los Angeles, like the rest of the United States, went through an economic boom after World War II. This caused real estate prices and property taxes linked to fair market value to rise dramatically (the latter problem was curtailed by the enactment of Proposition 13 in 1978). At the same time, during the 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s (the period when Hollywood underwent the transition from the Golden Age to New Hollywood), global movie audiences were increasingly annoyed by films that were supposedly set all over the world, but were obviously filmed in California. The primitive special effects technology of the era made it difficult to remove clues, such as chaparral-covered hills at the horizon line. Audiences wanted to see actors in locations which were both exotic and authentic, as opposed to Hollywood constructed copies. The box office failure of the 1967 film Camelot was blamed in part on this issue, which in turn marked the end of large-scale backlot production in Southern California. By the early 1970s, the industry had transitioned to location shooting for the majority of outdoor scenes, and backlots were widely viewed as an obsolete, unwanted capital expenditure and a tax burden on studios. Many were razed and the land was either sold to developers or repurposed for theme parks or office buildings. Since the late-1990s, the increased use of CGI and blue/green screen effects in big budget movies has further sped up the decline in use of studio backlots, as more and more films are shot completely indoors. Though some studios like MGM and Fox sold vast tracts in the 1960s and 1970s, many historical sets continue to be demolished today, as there seems to be little interest in their preservation.

He represented Utah in the United States Senate from 1933 until 1951. Biography Thomas was born in Salt Lake City, Utah Territory on June 17, 1883 to Caroline Stockdale and Richard Kendall Thomas. He was the fifth of 12 children. His parents loved the arts, especially the theater. They built the first Children's Playhouse west of the Mississippi River in a barn on their property, which they named the Barnacle. Elbert was involved in many plays held for the public in the Barnacle. His father was involved in local government and held conventions and political rallies at the Barnacle. His family later moved to a home across from what is now the Conference Center of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church). This home is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. While an undergraduate student at the University of Utah, Thomas helped found the Amici Fidissimi Society in 1902. The AF Society was a men's fraternal organization which later affiliated with Phi Delta Theta fraternity, an international college fraternity, in 1914, becoming the Utah Alpha Chapter of the Fraternity. Elbert was the first initiate into Phi Delta Theta at the University of Utah. Thomas married Edna Harker on June 25, 1907, in the Salt Lake Temple and they had three daughters together. Edna died in 1942, and Elbert later married Ethel Evans in 1946 in the Salt Lake Temple. Church service Thomas served a mission to Japan for the LDS Church with his first wife, from 1907 to 1912. He was one of the first LDS missionaries sent to Japan, and his first daughter, Chiyo, was born there. Elbert developed a deep love for the Japanese people and learned to speak Japanese fluently. He was the author of Sukui No Michi, the Japanese translation of the Mormon tract Way of Salvation. For part of his five-year mission, Thomas was the president of the Japanese Mission. On his return from Japan, he became a Professor of Political Science and History at the University of Utah (where he had received his B.A. in 1906). He taught Latin, Greek and Japanese culture, as well as being a Political Science and History professor and eventually an Administrator on the Board of Regents at the University of Utah for many years. Political office Thomas was first elected to the Senate as a Democrat in 1932, defeating Republican Reed Smoot. He served on the Committee on Education and Labor (of which he was the Chairman), the Committee on Military Affairs, the Mines and Mining Committee, and the Committee on Labor and Public Welfare. In April 1943 a confidential analysis of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee by British scholar Isaiah Berlin for the British Foreign Office characterized Thomas as: Thomas was among twelve nominated at the 1944 Democratic National Convention to serve as Franklin D. Roosevelt's running mate in the presidential election that year. He served three terms before being defeated for reelection by Wallace F. Bennett in 1950. In 1951, he was appointed High Commissioner over the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands. Elbert died in Honolulu, Hawaii Territory on February 11, 1953. He was buried in the Thomas family plot in the Salt Lake City Cemetery. Legacy The Gibbs-Thomas House, in Salt Lake City, which was Thomas' sole residence in Utah, was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1984 in large part to recognize his association.

In 1991, he won the Thelonious Monk International Jazz Saxophone Competition. Life and career Joshua Redman was born in Berkeley, California, to jazz saxophonist Dewey Redman and dancer and librarian Renee Shedroff. He is Jewish. He was exposed to many kinds of music at the Center for World Music in Berkeley, where his mother studied South Indian dance. Some of his earliest lessons in music and improvisation were on recorder with gamelan player Jody Diamond. He was exposed at an early age to a variety of musics and instruments and began playing clarinet at age nine before switching to what became his primary instrument, the tenor saxophone, one year later. Redman cites John Coltrane, Ornette Coleman, Cannonball Adderley, his father Dewey Redman, as well as the Beatles, Aretha Franklin, the Temptations, Earth, Wind and Fire, Prince, the Police and Led Zeppelin as musical influences. Redman graduated from Berkeley High School, class of 1986, after having been a part of the award-winning Berkeley High School Jazz Ensemble for all four years of high school. After graduation, Joshua frequented the classroom jam sessions of Bay Area pianist and professor of music (at Laney College in Oakland, California), Ed Kelly. It was there that he performed alongside saxophonist Robert Stewart. In 1991, he graduated summa cum laude with a degree in Social Studies from Harvard University, where he was a member of Phi Beta Kappa Society. He had already been accepted by Yale Law School, but deferred entrance for what he believed was only going to be one year. Some of his friends had recently relocated to Brooklyn, and they were looking for another housemate to help with the rent. Redman accepted their invitation to move in, and almost immediately he found himself immersed in the New York jazz scene. He began jamming and gigging regularly with some of the leading jazz musicians of his generation and that of his father, including Brad Mehldau, Peter Martin, Mark Turner, Peter Bernstein, Roy Hargrove, Christian McBride, Kevin Hays, Jorge Rossy, Pat Metheny, Charlie Haden and Billy Higgins, among others. Redman won the Thelonious Monk International Jazz Saxophone Competition in 1991, and began focusing on his musical career. He was signed by Warner Bros. Records and issued his first self-titled album in the spring of 1993, which subsequently earned Redman his first Grammy nomination. He continued to develop his style throughout the 1990s, beginning with a sideman appearance on Elvin Jones' Youngblood alongside Javon Jackson, and following up with an appearance on his father Dewey's 1992 record Choices. On his second album as a leader, Wish, he was joined by a notable lineup consisting of guitarist Pat Metheny, bassist Charlie Haden and drummer Billy Higgins; this group then toured as The Joshua Redman Quartet, featuring Christian McBride in place of Charlie Haden. He continued to work with various quartets, including one with pianist Brad Mehldau until forming a new trio, Elastic, with keyboardist Sam Yahel and drummer Brian Blade. The trio debuted under the moniker Yaya3, producing one album under this name. The same group of musicians made up the core on Redman's Elastic album, before becoming known as the Joshua Redman Elastic Band. Some of his works were featured on The Weather Channel's Local on the 8s. Redman performed in a fictitious supergroup, \\"The Louisiana Gator Boys\\", in the 1998 film Blues Brothers 2000, performing on \\"How Blue Can You Get?\\" and \\"New Orleans\\". 2000s In 1999, Joshua Redman was immortalized in the children's TV show Arthur on PBS. He appeared in the tenth episode of the fourth season, where it was rumored by the characters that he would get in a fight with famed cellist Yo-Yo Ma, who also appeared in the episode. In 2000, Redman was named Artistic Director for the Spring Season of the non-profit jazz-presenting organization SFJAZZ. Redman co-founded the SFJAZZ with Executive Director Randall Kline, as the SFJAZZ Collective, an ensemble distinguished by the creativity of its members and a primary emphasis on composition. In March 2007, Redman announced that he was taking a hiatus from both the SFJAZZ Artistic Directorship and the SFJAZZ Collective in order to focus on new projects. In 2004, Redman first sat in with Umphrey's McGee at their performance in Boston, Massachusetts, at the Paradise Rock Club. Redman has collaborated with Umphrey's McGee around 20 times since, including an all- improvised set in Madison, Wisconsin in January 2016. In 2006, he performed with the New Zealand Symphony orchestra in composer John Psathas' concerto for saxophone and drumkit, Omnifenix, which was released in Rattle Records' album, View from Olympus. The album won Best Classical Album for 2007 in the New Zealand music awards. Redman performing at the Aarhus Jazz Festival in 2009 In April 2007, Nonesuch released Redman's first ever piano-less trio record, Back East, featuring Joshua alongside three bass and drum rhythm sections (Larry Grenadier & Ali Jackson, Christian McBride & Brian Blade, Reuben Rogers & Eric Harland) and three guest saxophonists (Chris Cheek, Joe Lovano and Dewey Redman). His January 2009 release, Compass, continued the trio tradition, and even included some tracks with a double-trio setup, featuring saxophone, two basses and two drummers. Starting in late 2009, Redman began performing with a new collaborative band called James Farm, featuring pianist Aaron Parks, bassist Matt Penman and drummer Eric Harland. They released their first self- titled album on April 26, 2011 and their follow-up album, City Folk on October 27, 2014. Redman was also an inaugural member of the Independent Music Awards' judging panel to support independent artists.Independent Music Awards ‚Äì Past Judges \\"11th Annual IMA Judges. Independent Music Awards. Retrieved on September 4, 2013. In early 2013, it was announced that Redman would release a new collection of vintage and contemporary ballads featuring a jazz quartet and an orchestral ensemble titled Walking Shadows. Produced by Redman's friend and frequent collaborator Brad Mehldau, the album also features Larry Grenadier (bass) and Brian Blade (drums). It was released on May 7, 2013 on Nonesuch. About Walking Shadows, the New York Times says \\"there hasn‚Äôt been a more sublimely lyrical gesture in his 20-year recording career.\\" On Sunday, December 8, 2013, Redman joined a group of jazz all-stars onstage at the Kennedy Center Honors in Washington, DC, to pay tribute to honoree Herbie Hancock in performance. The event aired on December 29, 2013 on CBS. In 2015, Redman received his third Grammy nomination for his solo on \\"Friend or Foe\\" from the album The Bad Plus Joshua Redman. In addition to his own projects, Redman has recorded and performed with musicians including Joey Alexander, Brian Blade, Ray Brown, Dave Brubeck, Chick Corea, The Dave Matthews Band, Jack DeJohnette, Bill Frisell, Aaron Goldberg, Larry Goldings, Charlie Haden, Herbie Hancock, Roy Hargrove, Roy Haynes, Billie Higgins, Milt Jackson, Elvin Jones, Quincy Jones, Big Daddy Kane, Geoff Keezer, B.B.

Obscure during his lifetime, he is now highly regarded by many musicians and critics. Life He was born in San Juan Hill, Manhattan in New York City, to parents from St. Kitts and Trinidad, and grew up in Harlem. During much of his career, he took work as a Dixieland musician while working on the more adventurous kind of jazz he preferred. He is best known today for these compositions, program music that combines bop, Dixieland, and music from the Caribbean with harmonies from Erik Satie and B√©la Bart√≥k. His first known work as a musician was with the Royal Barons in 1937, but he did not find performing at Minton's Playhouse a few years later a very happy experience. The competition didn't suit him. However, he did become friends with pianist Thelonious Monk. Nichols was drafted into the Army in 1941. After the war he worked in various settings, beginning to achieve some recognition when Mary Lou Williams recorded some of his songs in 1952. From about 1947 he persisted in trying to persuade Alfred Lion at Blue Note Records to sign him up. He finally recorded some of his compositions for Blue Note in 1955 and 1956, some of which were not issued until the 1980s. His tune \\"Serenade\\" had lyrics added, and as \\"Lady Sings the Blues\\" became firmly identified with Billie Holiday. In 1957 he recorded his last album for Bethlehem Records. Nichols died from leukemia in New York City at the age of 44. One of the four essays in A.B. Spellman's Four Lives in the Bebop Business (also known as Four Jazz Lives, 1966) is about Nichols. A biography, Herbie Nichols: A Jazzist's Life, written by Mark Miller, was published in 2009. Influence His music has been most energetically promoted by Roswell Rudd, who worked with Nichols in the early 1960s. Rudd recorded or programmed at least three albums featuring Nichols' compositions, including The Unheard Herbie Nichols (1996) and a book The Unpublished Works (2000). In 1984, the Steve Lacy quintet with George Lewis, Misha Mengelberg, Han Bennink and Arjen Gorter performed the music of Nichols at the Ravenna Jazz Festival in Italy. A New York group, the Herbie Nichols Project (part of the Jazz Composers Collective) has recorded three albums largely dedicated to unrecorded Nichols' compositions, many of which Nichols had deposited in the Library of Congress.

A member of the Republican Party, he served as a United States Senator from Utah from 1951 to 1974. He was the father of Bob Bennett, who later held his seat in the Senate (1993‚Äì2011). Early life and education Wallace Bennett was born in Salt Lake City, Utah, to John Foster and Rosetta Elizabeth (n√©e Wallace) Bennett. His grandparents were English immigrants who came to the United States in 1868. He received his early education at local public schools, and graduated from LDS High School in 1916. He then enrolled at the University of Utah, where he majored in English and won a varsity letter in debate. Bennett, a member of the university's Reserve Officers' Training Corps, interrupted his college education to serve in the United States Army during World War I. He was commissioned as a second lieutenant of the Infantry in September 1918, and was assigned as an instructor in the Student Army Training Corps at Colorado College. He later returned to the University of Utah, and earned his Bachelor of Arts degree in 1919. For a year following his graduation, he served as principal of San Luis Stake Academy in Manassa, Colorado. Family In 1922, Bennett married Frances Marion Grant, the youngest daughter of Heber J. Grant (who served as President of the LDS Church from 1918 to 1945). The couple had three sons, Wallace, David, and Robert; and two daughters, Rosemary and Frances. Frances served for a time as a member of the Primary General Board of the LDS Church.Ronald Walker, \\"Jedediah and Heber\\", Ensign, 1979 Business career In 1920, Bennett returned to Salt Lake City and became an office clerk at Bennett's Paint and Glass Company, which his father had established. He was later advanced to cashier, production manager, and sales manager. He became secretary-treasurer of the company in 1929 and, following his father's death in 1938, became president and general manager. He served in that position until 1950, when he became chairman of the board. In 1938, the company completed what Bennett described as the most modern paint manufacturing plant in the West. In addition to his work in his family's business, Bennett organized a Ford dealership known as the Bennett Motor Company, serving as its president from 1939 to 1950. He also served as president of the Cardon Jewelry Company and of the National Glass Distributors Association; vice-president of Glayton Investment Company and of the National Paint, Varnish and Lacquer Association; and director of Zion's Savings Bank and Trust Company, the Utah Oil Refining Company, and the Utah Home Fire Insurance Company. In 1949, he was elected president of the National Association of Manufacturers. He spent his year-long tenure as president traveling the country, preaching \\"the partnership of the men who put up the money, the men who do the work, and the men who tie the whole thing together.\\" He hosted a daily one-hour program called The Observatory Hour on KSL (1932‚Äì1933), and was president of the Salt Lake Civic Opera Company (1938‚Äì41) and the Salt Lake Community Chest (1944‚Äì1945). In 1935, he became treasurer of the Latter-day Saints Sunday School General Board. He directed the chorus of student nurses of LDS Hospital (1942‚Äì48), and wrote the words to God of Power, God of Right which is Hymn #20 in the 1985 Latter-day Saints Hymnal. He authored Faith and Freedom (1950) and Why I am a Mormon (1958). U.S. Senate In March 1950, Bennett announced his candidacy for a seat in the United States Senate from Utah. After receiving the Republican nomination, he faced three-term Democratic incumbent Elbert D. Thomas in the general election. During the campaign, he accused Thomas of having Communist positions and circulated pamphlets associating Thomas with Communist organizations and figures. In November, he defeated Thomas by a margin of 54%-46%. He was subsequently re-elected to three more terms. =The silver problem= In the late 1950s, the US Treasury became a begrudging supplier of silver at $0.905 an ounce. Bennett warned that the lack of supply versus the high demand would cause the deficit to fall on the Treasury Stocks. By 1961, the Treasury Stocks had unnecessarily been depleted. In 1963, the government had only 30 million ounces of free silver, against the annual coinage requirement for the United States of more than 75 million ounces. The price of silver per ounce was now $1.2929, but if the United States bought extra silver, the price would go above $ 1.29. The Silver Purchase Act of 1963 was supported by Bennett and repealed \\"existing silver purchase requirements and the transfer of tax of silver bullion.\\" It also allowed the Federal Reserve to issue $1 and $2 notes to replace \\"silver certificates or the denominations thus making 1.6 billion ounces of silver available to the United States Treasury.\\" Bennett Spoke at a Convention of the American Mining Congress in 1963 declaring the coin and silver problem had reached a catastrophic level. His views were faced with much criticism. Two years later to function properly, the Treasury proposed a new set of coins. Bennett joined forces with the administration and worked on a solution, the Coinage Act of 1965, which he got through Congress to be enacted into law. =Leadership= During his 23 years in the Senate, Bennett earned a reputation as a conservative and a pro-business advocate, opposing government regulations and supporting right-to-work laws. He served as a member of the Senate Finance and Banking and Currency Committees, as well as the Joint Committee on Atomic Energy and Defense Production. Bennett was the vice chairman of Senate Ethics Committee. Bennett voted in favor of the Civil Rights Acts of 1957, 1960, 1964, and 1968, as well as the Voting Rights Act of 1965 and the confirmation of Thurgood Marshall to the U.S. Supreme Court, but Bennett did not vote on the 24th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. He also supported a measure that prohibited federal aid to schools that practiced racial discrimination. He opposed the Partial Nuclear Test Ban Treaty and the creation of Medicare. He also voted against the Equal Rights Amendment.https://www.govtrack.us/congress/votes/92-1972/s533 He was also instrumental in bringing the Central Utah Project and the defense and aerospace industries to Utah. By the end of his political career, Bennett was the ranking Republican on Senate Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs Committee, and the Senate Finance Committee. He was \\"recognized as one of the nations leading fiscal and monetary experts.\\" Bennett declined to seek re-election in 1974, and resigned on December 20 of that year to let his elected successor, Jake Garn, take office early and gain seniority. Later life and death Following his departure from the Senate, Bennett returned to Salt Lake City and resumed his business pursuits, serving on a variety of boards. When his son Robert was elected to his former Senate seat in 1992, the elder Bennett said, \\"Bob and I have made Utah history. We are the first father and son combination to be elected to the U.S. Senate in this state.\\" Bennett died at his home in Salt Lake City, at age 95. He is buried at Salt Lake City Cemetery.

A location () is inscribed on a stone plaque, located on a monument at the site. The western coast is a mixture of sandy beaches and rocky cliff promontories: around Cabo da Roca, cliffs are more than 100 metres in height, and cut into crystalline rocks, composed of strongly folded and faulted sedimentary units. These forms are disturbed by dikes and small beaches.Anja Scheffers and Dieter Kelletat (2005), p.6 This promontory of \\"high\\" beaches is the extreme western immersion of the ancient eruptive Sintra massif, as evident from the rose- coloured granite in the north and syenite of the Ribeira do Louri√ßal in the south. In the vicinity of the Cape, there are geomorphological examples of gabbro-diorite, volcanic breccia, and granite. Part of the granite formations show evidence of strong coastal erosion, while in other areas there are limestone deposits embedded in the granite.Ant√≥nio Oliveira Fonseca (2010), p.11 Much of the vegetation on this cape is low-lying and adapted to saltwater and windy conditions. Once home to a variety of plant life, Cabo da Roca has been overrun with the invasive plant species Carpobrotus edulis. This creeping, mat-forming plant, a member of the Aizoaceae succulent family, was introduced as ground cover by local residents several decades ago, but now covers much of the arable land on Cabo da Roca. Many migratory and marine birds roost temporarily along the cliffs and protected coves of the coastal area.

In the context of software architecture, data flow relates to stream processing or reactive programming. Software architecture Dataflow is a software paradigm based on the idea of disconnecting computational actors into stages (pipelines) that can execute concurrently. Dataflow can also be called stream processing or reactive programming.A Short Intro to Stream Processing There have been multiple data- flow/stream processing languages of various forms (see Stream processing). Data-flow hardware (see Dataflow architecture) is an alternative to the classic Von Neumann architecture. The most obvious example of data-flow programming is the subset known as reactive programming with spreadsheets. As a user enters new values, they are instantly transmitted to the next logical \\"actor\\" or formula for calculation. Distributed data flows have also been proposed as a programming abstraction that captures the dynamics of distributed multi-protocols. The data-centric perspective characteristic of data flow programming promotes high-level functional specifications and simplifies formal reasoning about system components. Hardware architecture Hardware architectures for dataflow was a major topic in Computer architecture research in the 1970s and early 1980s. Jack Dennis of MIT pioneered the field of static dataflow architectures. Designs that use conventional memory addresses as data dependency tags are called static dataflow machines. These machines did not allow multiple instances of the same routines to be executed simultaneously because the simple tags could not differentiate between them. Designs that use Content-addressable memory are called dynamic dataflow machines by Arvind. They use tags in memory to facilitate parallelism. Data flows around the computer through the components of the computer. It gets entered from the input devices and can leave through output devices (printer etc.). Concurrency A dataflow network is a network of concurrently executing processes or automata that can communicate by sending data over channels (see message passing.) In Kahn process networks, named after Gilles Kahn, the processes are determinate. This implies that each determinate process computes a continuous function from input streams to output streams, and that a network of determinate processes is itself determinate, thus computing a continuous function. This implies that the behavior of such networks can be described by a set of recursive equations, which can be solved using fixed point theory. The movement and transformation of the data is represented by a series of shapes and lines.

It is Grisham's fifth novel. Plot In 1967, in Greenville, Mississippi, the office of Jewish lawyer Marvin Kramer is bombed, injuring Kramer and killing his two young sons. Sam Cayhall, a member of the Ku Klux Klan, is identified, arrested and tried for their murders, committed in retaliation for Kramer's involvement in the Civil Rights Movement. Sam's first two trials, engineered by his Klan-connected lawyer, each end in a mistrial. Twenty years later, the FBI pressures a suspected associate to testify against Sam at a third trial. Sam is convicted and sentenced to death by lethal gas. He is sent to the Mississippi State Penitentiary and placed on death row. Now without a lawyer, Sam becomes a pro bono case for a team of anti-death penalty lawyers from the large - and Jewish - Chicago law firm of Kravitz and Bane. Representing Sam is his own grandson, Adam Hall, who travels to the firm's Memphis office to aid Sam in the final month before his scheduled execution. Although lacking experience in death penalty cases, Adam is determined to argue a stay for his grandfather. Sam, despite his violent past, is one of the few living links to Adam's family history. Sam's alcoholic daughter, Lee Cayhall Booth, slowly reveals the family's tragic past to her nephew, Adam. Initially uncooperative, Sam eventually opens up to Adam and reveals a remarkable depth of hard-won legal knowledge, regularly preparing his own briefs and court motions. Adam interviews the FBI agent in charge of the original case and realizes that Sam almost certainly did not commit the actual crime for which he had been found guilty, although he was present. Nevertheless, Sam has a long and largely- secret history of Klan-related crimes, including several murders. Dogan, the associate who testified against Sam at his third trial, has apparently been murdered by the Klan. Sam himself will not reveal if another associate exists, thus not violating the Klan's loyalty oath. Adam desperately files motion after motion and argues some of them before judges. He seeks to persuade Mississippi's governor to grant a reprieve, knowing full well that such a move is politically impossible; Sam forbids such a move, suspecting that the governor is using him for political gain. All appeals are finally exhausted. Sam is now repentant, but does not want Adam as a witness to the execution. He faces the last moment with courage and fortitude, publicly repudiating his past with the Klan, and dies proud of his grandson and happy to have forged a strong link with him during this last month. The sentence is carried out, Sam having ordered Adam to walk away and not watch him die. With Sam and Dogan dead, no one knows that Roland, the third man who prepared and set off the bomb, is still free and living nearby under a false identity and observing the progress of the case - having graduated from Klan member to a full-fledged \\"proud fascist\\" and neo-Nazi. The reader knows - but Adam never does - that Roland stalked the young lawyer and considered killing him, but concluded it was not necessary and that Sam would take his secret to the grave. Meanwhile, Adam, sickened but fascinated by the experience - and disliking the idea of having a career as a corporate lawyer - quits Kravitz and Bane. Instead he accepts a poorly-paid position with a group of anti-death penalty lawyers.

Jack and Jason Schneider, Have Not Been the Same: The Can-Rock Renaissance 1985-1995. ECW Press. . Punk bands Bergmann began his musical career with an Abbotsford band called the Mount Lehman Grease Band. After Mount Lehman folded, he founded his own band, called the Notorious Smorg Brothers, which he stocked with a myriad of different support artists. Bergmann was later the lead singer and songwriter for Vancouver punk stalwarts Young Canadians (formerly The K-Tels). Although the Young Canadians only recorded two independent EPs and a single before breaking up, their song \\"Hawaii\\" (co- written with Ross Carpenter) is one of the classic Canadian punk anthems. Although long out of print, the EPs, along with some unreleased live material, were reissued in 1995 as the album No Escape. Solo career In the 1980s, Bergmann played with Vancouver independent bands Los Popularos and Poisoned before the latter band signed to Duke Street Records in 1988. Due to confusion with the popular American band Poison which had marred the band's most recent tour, however, the label decided to bill the band's releases as solo albums by Bergmann. He released his debut solo album, the John Cale-produced Crawl with Me, that year. He garnered a Juno Award nomination for Most Promising Male Vocalist at the Juno Awards of 1989, and James O'Mara and Kate Ryan were nominated for Best Music Video for Bergmann's \\"Our Little Secret\\".\\"Bergmann rocks on explosive edge\\". Toronto Star, March 29, 1990. 1990's Sexual Roulette, produced by Chris Wardman, became Bergmann's mainstream breakthrough, spawning the rock radio hit \\"Bound for Vegas\\" and garnering him a deal with Polygram Records. He followed up with a self-titled album on Polygram in 1991, again garnering significant radio airplay for the singles \\"Faithlessly Yours\\", \\"If She Could Sing\\" and \\"Message From Paul\\". In 1994 he collaborated with One Free Fall on a cover of Neil Young's \\"Prisoners of Rock and Roll\\" for the tribute album Borrowed Tunes,\\"Bergmann on his way to some Fresh Hell: Sony was impressed enough with Vancouver rocker to back album\\".

The Province, March 11, 1996. but the album was not a strong performer on the charts and he was then dropped from the label. Bergmann quit the music business for a period following his release by Sony, performing sporadically between 1995 and 1998.Ben Rayner, \\"Bergmann living down his reputation\\". Toronto Star, October 15, 1998: G4. The 1998 Design Flaw, produced by Peter J. Moore and released on the independent label Other People's Music, was a reworking of tracks from his first three albums, plus a cover of Gram Parsons' \\"Sin City\\". The songs featured Bergmann on acoustic guitar, with backing by Chris Spedding on electric. Bergmann then released Vultura Freeway, a compilation of unreleased demo recordings from the early 1980s, in 2000, with liner notes from Pointed Sticks front man Nick Jones. Following Vultura Freeway, however, Bergmann withdrew from the music business for several years, due to health difficulties with degenerative arthritis.\\"Bergmann still kicking the chair away; Arthritis can't dampen spirit of punk\\". Victoria Times-Colonist, September 4, 2014. In 2009 Bergmann's bassist Ray Fulber compiled the CD Lost Art Bergmann, which featured early demo versions of most of the songs that appeared on the 1988 John Cale produced album. These demo recordings served as a tonic to many fans as they have a more guitar driven sound than the keyboard heavy Cale produced sessions. On August 26, 2014, Bergmann released Songs for the Underclass through the independent label (weewerk). On May 13, 2016, Bergmann released The Apostate, his first full-length album of new material since 1995.\\"Art Bergmann Returns with 'The Apostate,' Premieres New Track\\".

CBC Music, May 4, 2017. Film appearances He has also appeared in two Bruce McDonald films, Highway 61 as Otto and Hard Core Logo as himself, and as a musician in Conjurer of Monikers. Additionally, he was featured in Bloodied but Unbowed, a film featured at the 2010 Vancouver Documentary Film Festival.

Tourism Signpost at Mehamn Airport. The trail was opened by Crown Princess Mette-Marit in 2004 to promote tourism. In sharp contrast to North Cape with its extensive tourist infrastructure and busloads of visitors, Cape Nordkinn is a lonely but impressive place that can only be visited following at least a full-day hike from Mehamn and one day back. The terrain is sufficiently difficult for hiking, consisting largely of several kilometers long rock fields, that it is advisable to prepare for more than two days for the round trip, since it is one way. There is no actual trail, only erected poles and cairns at rather long distances apart. It is advisable not to travel in rainy weather, as the slippery stones make the terrain very difficult, with sudden fogs and associated whiteout. In fog the orientation on the highland south of the cape can be impossible without a GPS. There is mobile phone coverage in the area, except on west facing slopes. The cape can also be reached by boat tours. The tourist bureau of Gamvik municipality provides tourist information. Hurtigruten ships call at Mehamn and Kj√∏llefjord to the southwest of the cape, providing a sighting opportunity for visitors on the way.

The periodic nature of this comet had been deduced by its namesake Edmond Halley in 1705, but Halley had died before seeing if his prediction would come true. Raised to become a successful farmer under a strict stepfather, Palitzsch secretly studied as much astronomy as he could from the books he could afford. He learned contemporary astronomy from the book ‚ÄúVorhof der Sternwissenschaft‚Äù (‚ÄúThe Forecourt of Astronomy‚Äù) by Christian Pescheck. He learned Latin and, at age 21, inherited the farm, which allowed him to construct his own botanical garden, library, laboratory, and museum. He received support from various benefactors, including the future King. But the wars between Prussia and Austria interrupted his ambitions. Upon his death on 21 February 1788 Palitzsch left behind a library of 3518 books, partly consisting of handwritten copies he had created from scientific works too expensive for him to purchase.

It is located in Galicia. Conventionally, it marks the western end of the Cantabrian Sea, or Bay of Biscay, in the North Atlantic ocean. The peninsula of Estaca de Bares penetrates considerably into the Atlantic Ocean and the Cantabrian Sea, and as a result it is one of the rainiest places in Europe, with more than 2500 mm a year (a Temperate rain forest). These special weather conditions have created over the centuries a unique ecosystem and biodiversity which have made it possible for this area to be declared an Area of National Natural Interest. The history of Estaca de Bares Point is very rich. The ruins of the Phoenician Salt Fish Factory and the Phoenician Port are open to visitors. There is a lighthouse that was constructed in 1850 and still works to this day, under the administration of the Captain of the Port of Ferrol, Spain. There is also a bird sanctuary, ruins of molinas (grain mills) and abandoned military bases located here. There is currently an abandoned military site there. It was first operated by the US Coast Guard beginning in the early 1960s as a LORAN (Long Range Aid to Navigation) Station. The station at Estaca de Bares operated jointly with stations operated by the British Government in East Blockhouse, Wales and, until 1973, the French Government in Pospoder, France. In 1978, after the Coast Guard ended the LORAN operations, the US Air Force assumed control of the base. The US Air Force 2186 Communications Squadron, headquartered at Torrej√≥n Air Base near Madrid, operated the site as a remote Radio Relay Link (RRL) communications site until 1991, and it now sits in ruins. While the site was open, many Americans met and married local citizens. There are also a series of waterways that used to power mills for the local citizens. These mills are located between the abandoned military base and the bird sanctuary. The other site used to be an old signaling station used by the Spanish Navy. It has been converted into a hotel/restaurant. During World War II a German submarine was sunk off the coast there. One of the German officers who survived the sinking returned every year thereafter to mark the anniversary. After his death he had his ashes scattered over Estaca de Bares.

Early life and career  Carson was born on German Street in Ancoats, Manchester. Her father William Brown Carson, who was Scottish, ran a flour mill and her mother, Mary Clarke (Tordoff) was an amateur singer. As a child, she took piano lessons while attending Church of England school, Carson performed with her younger sister Nellie as a singing act called the Carson Sisters. In 1913 she became a cinema pianist providing the musical accompaniment for silent films. She married road contractor George Peploe on 1 September 1926, but he died in 1929, aged only 31. They had no children. Carson never remarried. The premature death of Peploe mirrored the early life of Carson's iconic character Ena Sharples many years later; in the years long before the show was created, Ena's fianc√© had died in World War I, and her husband died prematurely in 1937. Radio and theatre career In 1935, Carson joined BBC Radio in Manchester, singing a range of material from comic musical hall style songs to light operatic arias. She began in a show called Songs at the Piano and was a regular member of Children's Hour on the BBC Home Service and was the star of Nursery Sing Song from Manchester, in which she frequently sang with producer Trevor Hill, many years her junior. Contrary to popular opinion she was never known as Auntie Vi, that epithet belonging only to Violet Fraser back in the 1920s. \\"I was never anyone's aunt\\" exclaimed Carson when Hill produced a BBC Radio programme about her in 1981. She worked with the Council for the Encouragement of Music and the Arts during the Second World War and was for six years the pianist for the Mabel and Wilfred Pickles radio show Have A Go. Her extensive radio career included a period as a presenter and interviewer on Woman's Hour for five years and she acted in numerous radio dramas. It was while recording a children's programme in 1951 that she first worked with Tony Warren, who would later be the creator of Coronation Street. On stage her curriculum vitae included playing the Duchess of York in William Shakespeare's tragedy Richard III.  Coronation Street  Carson is best remembered for her role as Ena Sharples, the flint-faced and gruff moral voice of Coronation Street, a role she played from 1960 to 1980. In 1962, she was named ITV Personality of the Year for her portrayal of Ena. For much of her near 20 years on the programme, Sharples' moralising caused her to spar regularly with Elsie Tanner (Pat Phoenix). She appeared in the first episode which was aired on 9 December 1960. Long after her departure from the programme and after her own death, Carson continues to be synonymous with the hairnet that Ena chose to wear for almost every occasion. As a singer, Carson was in the soprano range and was a regular on the Christian hymnal programme Stars on Sunday during its ten-year run from 1969. On 14 February 1968, Violet sailed from Southampton on the P&O; liner Oriana, bound for Australia. She arrived in Fremantle on 6 March 1968 and Melbourne on 9 March 1968. Thousands of Australians greeted her on the docks. On 22 March 1968, she attended the 10th Annual Australian TV Week Logie Awards (named after John Logie Baird) at the Southern Cross Hotel in Melbourne, where she presented awards to some of the main winners that year. During the 1970s, Carson suffered a series of strokes and endured other health problems, and only played Ena sporadically throughout the decade. She took time off from Coronation Street in 1973 after suffering a nervous breakdown. In April 1980, Carson's departure from Coronation Street was aired, except that nobody knew at the time that it would be her last appearance in the show. A storyline involving Ena moving to Lytham St. Annes, near Blackpool, to stay with a friend while her flat at the street's community centre was being renovated, was aired. When the character returned, the flat was not ready and Ena announced on screen (to characters Ken Barlow and Albert Tatlock) that she would return to her flat‚Äîbut only if she felt like doing so. It was at this point that Carson became ill with pernicious anaemia and was forced to leave the programme, although at the time it was anticipated that she would return at some stage. However, this did not happen and henceforth, all storylines involving the return of Ena Sharples had to be shelved because Carson was not well enough to appear, although Ena Sharples was still considered an active character. Carson lived in a bungalow in Cleveleys, Blackpool, with her sister Nellie, and refused to make any public appearances after her retirement. The year after she retired, Carson underwent surgery for an abscess from which she never fully recovered. Death  Carson died of heart failure, aged 85, in her sleep, on Boxing Day 1983, at her home, 18 Fleetwood Road, Blackpool. She was cremated at Carleton Crematorium, Blackpool, and is commemorated at Bispham Parish Church in Blackpool. A memorial service dedicated to Carson was held at Manchester Cathedral in January 1984, and was attended by several of her Coronation Street colleagues including William Roache (Ken Barlow). Honours  She was made an Officer of the Order of the British Empire in 1965 and had a rose cultivar named after her ('Violet Carson', McGredy 1964). Wax statues of her are held at Madame Tussauds in London and Blackpool. She is commemorated by a blue plaque outside Granada Studios in Manchester, where she filmed the majority of her work as Ena Sharples.

Early life He was born in Laramie, the seat of Albany County in western Wyoming, the son of the former Evangeline Victoria Owen and Stephen Wheeler Downey. He was educated in public schools of Laramie, and attended the University of Wyoming. Downey attended the University of Michigan Law School, and attained admission to the bar in 1907. In 1914, the school awarded Downey his LL.B. degree as of the graduating class of 1907. He practiced law in Laramie, and in 1908 he was elected district attorney of Albany County as a Republican. In 1910 he married Helen Symons; they had five children. In 1912, Downey split Wyoming's Republican vote by heading the state's \\"Bull Moose\\" revolt in support of Theodore Roosevelt, thus leading to a Democratic victory statewide. Politics In 1913, Downey moved to Sacramento, California, and continued to practice law with his brother, Stephen Wheeler Downey, Jr. During his first few years in California, he devoted most of his time and energy to his law practice and various real estate interests. In 1924 he supported Robert La Follette, Sr.'s Progressive party campaign for the presidency, and in 1932 he became a Democrat and campaigned for the election of Franklin D. Roosevelt. In October 1933, Downey announced that he was running for governor of California. After a series of meetings with the writer Upton Sinclair, who also had designs on the governorship, Downey agreed to run for Lieutenant Governor of California while Sinclair ran for governor. Their political platform was the End Poverty in California (EPIC) plan. Opponents called the ticket \\"Uppie and Downey\\". EPIC began as a mass movement, calling for an economic revolution to lift California out of the depression. The EPIC platform called for state support for the creation of jobs, a massive program of public works, and an extensive system of state-sponsored pensions and radical changes in the tax structure. Downey talking with Francis Townsend Before long, more than 2,000 grassroots EPIC clubs sprouted throughout the state, and the most popular EPIC anthem, \\"Campaign Chorus for Downey and Sinclair,\\" was made into a phonograph record by Titan Records for mass distribution. It featured the speaking voice of Downey, announcer Jerry Wilford, and the singing of three men calling themselves the \\"Epic Trio.\\" While EPIC was defeated by Republican Frank Merriam in November 1934. Downey, who had been subjected to less vitriol than Sinclair during the campaign, remained a viable political force in the state. Downey actually garnered 123,000 votes more than his running mate. Downey gained a statewide reputation as a champion of progressive politics. After Sinclair's defeat, Downey became an attorney involved with Dr. Francis Townsend, the main advocate of the Townsend Plan for government old-age pensions. Townsend's $200-a-month pension plan had won a large following in California, particularly among retirees. Downeys support lead to him writing Why I Believe in the Townsend Plan (1936). In 1936, the two drifted apart, as Townsend supported Union Party presidential nominee William Lemke of North Dakota, and Downey remained a Democrat committed to Franklin Delano Roosevelt. U.S. Senate Downey in Washington, D.C. Sheridan Downey on 27 September 1938 In 1938 Downey was elected to the United States Senate where he served until his resignation in November 1950. He ran as a supporter of the proposed \\"Ham and Eggs\\" government pension program and defeated incumbent Senator William Gibbs McAdoo in the Democratic primary by more than 135,000 votes. Despite the strong backing McAdoo received from the White House and a personal campaign appearance by President Franklin Roosevelt to endorse McAdoo, Downey won the primary and went on to win the general election, defeating Republican Philip Bancroft 54%-46%. On October 24, 1938, Downey appeared on the cover of Time magazine. Though he had been considered a staunch liberal, Downey as a senator became a conservative Democrat who won the support of California's major oil interests. He supported the efforts of oil companies and agribusiness to procure state, rather than federal, control of California's oil resources. He also worked to exempt the California Central Valley from the Reclamation Act of 1902 to assist corporate farms.Kenneth Franklin Kurz, Nixon's Enemies, NTC/Contemporary Publishing Group, 1998, p. 102 In the Senate, Downey also introduced a series of pension bills, and in 1941, he was named chairman of a special Senate committee on old-age insurance. He took an early stand supporting a military draft but opposed the Roosevelt administration's plans to requisition industries in time of war. During World War II, he called for the creation of a committee to investigate the status of blacks and other minorities in the armed forces and advocated a postwar United Nations, international control of atomic energy, increased veterans' benefits, and federal pay raises. At the end of the war, he opposed continuation of the military draft. During his years in the Senate, Downey often represented the interests of California's powerful motion picture industry. His shift from a liberal New Dealer to a conservative Democrat would become officially recognized after the war ended.G. J. Barker-Benfield, Catherine Clinton, Portraits of American Women: From Settlement to the Present, Oxford University, 1998, pg. 554. Re-election After his narrow reelection to the Senate in 1944, defeating Republican Lieutenant Governor Frederick F. Houser by 52 percent to 48 percent, Downey began a push for the California Central Valley project, which had been initiated during the 1930s as part of the New Deal's vast array of public works projects, such as power dams and irrigation canals. In a 1947 book entitled They Would Rule the Valley, Downey argued that the farmers of the Central Valley, who controlled water rights based on state law, would come into conflict with the federal Bureau of Reclamation. Downey acknowledged that Central Valley farmers were technically in violation of the Reclamation Act of 1902, but defended these violations of Federal law as necessary because, in the context of California agriculture the Federal limitation was impractical.Downey, Sheridan. 1947. They Would Rule the Valley San Francisco, self published Downey's political views made him vulnerable. Helen Gahagan Douglas challenged him in a primary. In 1950 Downey dropped out of the race, citing ill health, and threw his support in the Democratic primary behind Manchester Boddy, the conservative and wealthy publisher of the Los Angeles Daily News. He even indicated that if Douglas won the primary, which she did, he would support Republican U.S. Representative Richard Nixon in the general election. In the ensuing Douglas-Nixon race, Nixon prevailed in what his critics called a smear campaign. From this race, Nixon emerged with the sobriquet \\"Tricky Dick\\".Kenneth Franklin Kurz, Nixon's Enemies, NTC/Contemporary Publishing Group, 1998, p. 103 Downey resigned from his Senate seat on November 30, 1950, enabling the governor to appoint Nixon, which gave him a seniority advantage over other senators elected in 1950. Later life and achievements After he left the Senate, Downey practiced law in Washington, D.C., until his death in San Francisco in 1961. Downey also served as a lobbyist representing the city of Long Beach and the large petroleum concerns leasing its extensive waterfront. Upon his passing, he donated his body to the University of California Medical Center in San Francisco. His papers are archived at the Bancroft Library in Berkeley. During his years in the Senate, Downey was often described as slight, grayish, and strikingly handsome. His political career in many ways typified the transformation of millions of Republican progressives who supported Theodore Roosevelt and the \\"Bull Moose\\" movement of 1912 into Democratic supporters of Franklin Roosevelt and the New Deal in the 1930s. During the 1930s and early 1940s, Downey was one of California's most significant progressive politicians. While he was often overshadowed in state politics by Republican progressives like Hiram Johnson and Earl Warren, Downey left a significant mark because of his tireless advocacy of old-age pensions, organized labor, and racial justice. His conservative turn after his reelection in 1944, when he increasingly represented the interests of big business, large agribusiness concerns, and the oil industry, has obscured his historical reputation as a one-time liberal and progressive force in California politics.

Definitions Let V and W be handlebodies of genus g, and let ∆í be an orientation reversing homeomorphism from the boundary of V to the boundary of W. By gluing V to W along ∆í we obtain the compact oriented 3-manifold : M = V \\\\cup_f W. Every closed, orientable three-manifold may be so obtained; this follows from deep results on the triangulability of three- manifolds due to Moise. This contrasts strongly with higher-dimensional manifolds which need not admit smooth or piecewise linear structures. Assuming smoothness the existence of a Heegaard splitting also follows from the work of Smale about handle decompositions from Morse theory. The decomposition of M into two handlebodies is called a Heegaard splitting, and their common boundary H is called the Heegaard surface of the splitting. Splittings are considered up to isotopy. The gluing map ∆í need only be specified up to taking a double coset in the mapping class group of H. This connection with the mapping class group was first made by W. B. R. Lickorish. Heegaard splittings can also be defined for compact 3-manifolds with boundary by replacing handlebodies with compression bodies. The gluing map is between the positive boundaries of the compression bodies. A closed curve is called essential if it is not homotopic to a point, a puncture, or a boundary component. A Heegaard splitting is reducible if there is an essential simple closed curve \\\\alpha on H which bounds a disk in both V and in W. A splitting is irreducible if it is not reducible. It follows from Haken's Lemma that in a reducible manifold every splitting is reducible. A Heegaard splitting is stabilized if there are essential simple closed curves \\\\alpha and \\\\beta on H where \\\\alpha bounds a disk in V, \\\\beta bounds a disk in W, and \\\\alpha and \\\\beta intersect exactly once. It follows from Waldhausen's Theorem that every reducible splitting of an irreducible manifold is stabilized. A Heegaard splitting is weakly reducible if there are disjoint essential simple closed curves \\\\alpha and \\\\beta on H where \\\\alpha bounds a disk in V and \\\\beta bounds a disk in W. A splitting is strongly irreducible if it is not weakly reducible. A Heegaard splitting is minimal or minimal genus if there is no other splitting of the ambient three-manifold of lower genus. The minimal value g of the splitting surface is the Heegaard genus of M. =Generalized Heegaard splittings= A generalized Heegaard splitting of M is a decomposition into compression bodies V_i, W_i, i=1,\\\\dots,n and surfaces H_i, i=1,\\\\dots, n such that \\\\partial_+ V_i = \\\\partial_+ W_i = H_i and \\\\partial_- W_i = \\\\partial_- V_{i+1}. The interiors of the compression bodies must be pairwise disjoint and their union must be all of M. The surface H_i forms a Heegaard surface for the submanifold V_i \\\\cup W_i of M. (Note that here each Vi and Wi is allowed to have more than one component.) A generalized Heegaard splitting is called strongly irreducible if each V_i \\\\cup W_i is strongly irreducible. There is an analogous notion of thin position, defined for knots, for Heegaard splittings. The complexity of a connected surface S, c(S), is defined to be \\\\operatorname{max}\\\\\\\\{0, 1 - \\\\chi(S)\\\\\\\\}; the complexity of a disconnected surface is the sum of complexities of its components. The complexity of a generalized Heegaard splitting is the multi-set {c(S_i)}, where the index runs over the Heegaard surfaces in the generalized splitting. These multi-sets can be well-ordered by lexicographical ordering (monotonically decreasing). A generalized Heegaard splitting is thin if its complexity is minimal. Examples Three-sphere: The three-sphere S^3 is the set of vectors in \\\\mathbb{R}^4 with length one. Intersecting this with the xyz hyperplane gives a two-sphere. This is the standard genus zero splitting of S^3. Conversely, by Alexander's Trick, all manifolds admitting a genus zero splitting are homeomorphic to S^3. Under the usual identification of \\\\mathbb{R}^4 with \\\\mathbb{C}^2 we may view S^3 as living in \\\\mathbb{C}^2. Then the set of points where each coordinate has norm 1/\\\\sqrt{2} forms a Clifford torus, T^2. This is the standard genus one splitting of S^3. (See also the discussion at Hopf bundle.) Stabilization: Given a Heegaard splitting H in M the stabilization of H is formed by taking the connected sum of the pair (M, H) with the pair (S^3, T^2). It is easy to show that the stabilization procedure yields stabilized splittings. Inductively, a splitting is standard if it is the stabilization of a standard splitting. Lens spaces: All have a standard splitting of genus one. This is the image of the Clifford torus in S^3 under the quotient map used to define the lens space in question. It follows from the structure of the mapping class group of the two-torus that only lens spaces have splittings of genus one. Three-torus: Recall that the three-torus T^3 is the Cartesian product of three copies of S^1 (circles). Let x_0 be a point of S^1 and consider the graph \\\\Gamma = S^1 \\\\times \\\\\\\\{x_0\\\\\\\\} \\\\times \\\\\\\\{x_0\\\\\\\\} \\\\cup \\\\\\\\{x_0\\\\\\\\} \\\\times S^1 \\\\times \\\\\\\\{x_0\\\\\\\\} \\\\cup \\\\\\\\{x_0\\\\\\\\} \\\\times \\\\\\\\{x_0\\\\\\\\} \\\\times S^1 . It is an easy exercise to show that V, a regular neighborhood of \\\\Gamma, is a handlebody as is T^3 - V. Thus the boundary of V in T^3 is a Heegaard splitting and this is the standard splitting of T^3. It was proved by Charles Frohman and Joel Hass that any other genus 3 Heegaard splitting of the three-torus is topologically equivalent to this one. Michel Boileau and Jean-Pierre Otal proved that in general any Heegaard splitting of the three-torus is equivalent to the result of stabilizing this example. Theorems Alexander's Lemma: Up to isotopy, there is a unique (piecewise linear) embedding of the two-sphere into the three-sphere. (In higher dimensions this is known as the Schoenflies theorem. In dimension two this is the Jordan curve theorem.) This may be restated as follows: the genus zero splitting of S^3 is unique. Waldhausen's Theorem: Every splitting of S^3 is obtained by stabilizing the unique splitting of genus zero. Suppose now that M is a closed orientable three-manifold. Reidemeister‚ÄìSinger Theorem: For any pair of splittings H_1 and H_2 in M there is a third splitting H in M which is a stabilization of both. Haken's Lemma: Suppose that S_1 is an essential two-sphere in M and H is a Heegaard splitting. Then there is an essential two-sphere S_2 in M meeting H in a single curve. Classifications There are several classes of three-manifolds where the set of Heegaard splittings is completely known. For example, Waldhausen's Theorem shows that all splittings of S^3 are standard. The same holds for lens spaces (as proved by Francis Bonahon and Otal). Splittings of Seifert fiber spaces are more subtle. Here, all splittings may be isotoped to be vertical or horizontal (as proved by Yoav Moriah and Jennifer Schultens). classified splittings of torus bundles (which includes all three-manifolds with Sol geometry). It follows from their work that all torus bundles have a unique splitting of minimal genus. All other splittings of the torus bundle are stabilizations of the minimal genus one. As of 2008, the only hyperbolic three-manifolds whose Heegaard splittings are classified are two-bridge knot complements, in a paper of Tsuyoshi Kobayashi. Applications and connections =Minimal surfaces= Heegaard splittings appeared in the theory of minimal surfaces first in the work of Blaine Lawson who proved that embedded minimal surfaces in compact manifolds of positive sectional curvature are Heegaard splittings. This result was extended by William Meeks to flat manifolds, except he proves that an embedded minimal surface in a flat three- manifold is either a Heegaard surface or totally geodesic. Meeks and Shing- Tung Yau went on to use results of Waldhausen to prove results about the topological uniqueness of minimal surfaces of finite genus in \\\\R^3. The final topological classification of embedded minimal surfaces in \\\\R^3 was given by Meeks and Frohman. The result relied heavily on techniques developed for studying the topology of Heegaard splittings. =Heegaard Floer homology= Heegaard diagrams, which are simple combinatorial descriptions of Heegaard splittings, have been used extensively to construct invariants of three- manifolds. The most recent example of this is the Heegaard Floer homology of Peter Ozsvath and Zolt√°n Szab√≥. The theory uses the g^{th} symmetric product of a Heegaard surface as the ambient space, and tori built from the boundaries of meridian disks for the two handlebodies as the Lagrangian submanifolds. History The idea of a Heegaard splitting was introduced by . While Heegaard splittings were studied extensively by mathematicians such as Wolfgang Haken and Friedhelm Waldhausen in the 1960s, it was not until a few decades later that the field was rejuvenated by , primarily through their concept of strong irreducibility.

The galaxy has a diameter of approximately , 30% the size of the Milky Way. It has a bright nucleus, an unusually large central bulge, and a prominent dust lane in its inclined disk. The dark dust lane and the bulge give this galaxy the appearance of a sombrero hat. Astronomers initially thought that the halo was small and light, indicative of a spiral galaxy, but the Spitzer Space Telescope found that the dust ring around the Sombrero Galaxy is larger and more massive than previously thought, indicative of a giant elliptical galaxy. Famous Sombrero Galaxy Shows Surprising Side The galaxy has an apparent magnitude of +8.0, making it easily visible with amateur telescopes, and it is considered by some authors to be the galaxy with the highest absolute magnitude within a radius of 10 megaparsecs of the Milky Way. Its large bulge, its central supermassive black hole, and its dust lane all attract the attention of professional astronomers. Observation history =Discovery= The Sombrero Galaxy was discovered on May 11, 1781 by Pierre M√©chain, who described the object in a May 1783 letter to J. Bernoulli that was later published in the Berliner Astronomisches Jahrbuch. Charles Messier made a hand-written note about this and five other objects (now collectively recognized as M104 ‚Äì M109) to his personal list of objects now known as the Messier Catalogue, but it was not \\"officially\\" included until 1921. William Herschel independently discovered the object in 1784 and additionally noted the presence of a \\"dark stratum\\" in the galaxy's disc, what is now called a dust lane. Later astronomers were able to connect M√©chain's and Herschel's observations. =Designation as a Messier object= In 1921, Camille Flammarion found Messier's personal list of the Messier objects including the hand-written notes about the Sombrero Galaxy. This was identified with object 4594 in the New General Catalogue, and Flammarion declared that it should be included in the Messier Catalogue. Since this time, the Sombrero Galaxy has been known as M104. Dust ring M104 in infrared As noted above, this galaxy's most striking feature is the dust lane that crosses in front of the bulge of the galaxy. This dust lane is actually a symmetrical ring that encloses the bulge of the galaxy. Most of the cold atomic hydrogen gas and the dust lie within this ring. The ring might also contain most of the Sombrero Galaxy's cold molecular gas, although this is an inference based on observations with low resolution and weak detections. Additional observations are needed to confirm that the Sombrero galaxy's molecular gas is constrained to the ring. Based on infrared spectroscopy, the dust ring is the primary site of star formation within this galaxy. Nucleus The nucleus of the Sombrero Galaxy is classified as a low-ionization nuclear emission-line region (LINER). These are nuclear regions where ionized gas is present, but the ions are only weakly ionized (i.e. the atoms are missing relatively few electrons). The source of energy for ionizing the gas in LINERs has been debated extensively. Some LINER nuclei may be powered by hot, young stars found in star formation regions, whereas other LINER nuclei may be powered by active galactic nuclei (highly energetic regions that contain supermassive black holes). Infrared spectroscopy observations have demonstrated that the nucleus of the Sombrero Galaxy is probably devoid of any significant star formation activity. However, a supermassive black hole has been identified in the nucleus (as discussed in the subsection below), so this active galactic nucleus is probably the energy source that weakly ionizes the gas in the Sombrero Galaxy. =Central supermassive black hole= In the 1990s, a research group led by John Kormendy demonstrated that a supermassive black hole is present within the Sombrero Galaxy. Using spectroscopy data from both the CFHT and the Hubble Space Telescope, the group showed that the speed of revolution of the stars within the center of the galaxy could not be maintained unless a mass 1 billion times the mass of the Sun, or , is present in the center. This is among the most massive black holes measured in any nearby galaxies. =Synchrotron radiation= At radio and X-ray wavelengths, the nucleus is a strong source of synchrotron radiation. Synchrotron radiation is produced when high-velocity electrons oscillate as they pass through regions with strong magnetic fields. This emission is quite common for active galactic nuclei. Although radio synchrotron radiation may vary over time for some active galactic nuclei, the luminosity of the radio emission from the Sombrero Galaxy varies only 10‚Äì20%. =Unidentified terahertz radiation= In 2006, two groups published measurements of the terahertz radiation from the nucleus of the Sombrero Galaxy at a wavelength of . This terahertz radiation was found not to originate from the thermal emission from dust (which is commonly seen at infrared and submillimeter wavelengths), synchrotron radiation (which is commonly seen at radio wavelengths), bremsstrahlung emission from hot gas (which is uncommonly seen at millimeter wavelengths), or molecular gas (which commonly produces submillimeter spectral lines). The source of the terahertz radiation remains unidentified. Globular clusters The Sombrero Galaxy has a relatively large number of globular clusters. Observational studies of globular clusters in the Sombrero Galaxy have produced estimates of the population in the range of 1,200 to 2,000. The ratio of the number of globular clusters to the total luminosity of the galaxy is high compared to the Milky Way and similar galaxies with small bulges, but the ratio is comparable to other galaxies with large bulges. These results have been repeatedly used to demonstrate that the number of globular clusters in galaxies is thought to be related to the size of the galaxies' bulges. The surface density of the globular clusters generally follows the light profile of the bulge except for near the center of the galaxy. Distance and brightness At least two methods have been used to measure the distance to the Sombrero Galaxy. The first method relies on comparing the measured fluxes from planetary nebulae in the Sombrero Galaxy to the known luminosity of planetary nebulae in the Milky Way. This method gave the distance to the Sombrero Galaxy as . The other method used is the surface brightness fluctuations method. This method uses the grainy appearance of the galaxy's bulge to estimate the distance to it. Nearby galaxy bulges will appear very grainy, while more distant bulges will appear smooth. Early measurements using this technique gave distances of . Later, after some refinement of the technique, a distance of was measured. This was even further refined in 2003 to be . The average distance measured through these two techniques is .average(29.6 ¬± 2.5, 29 ¬± 2) = ((29.6 + 29) / 2) ¬± ((2.52 \\\\+ 22)0.5 / 2) = 29.3 ¬± 1.6 The absolute magnitude (in the blue) of the Sombrero Galaxy is estimated to be ‚àí21.9 at (‚àí21.8 at the average distance of above), that as stated above makes it the brightest galaxy within a radius of around the Milky Way. A report from 2016 used the Hubble Space Telescope to measure the distance to M104 based on the tip of the red-giant branch method yielding 9.55 ¬± 0.13 ¬± 0.31 Mpc. Nearby galaxies and galaxy group information The Sombrero Galaxy lies within a complex, filament-like cloud of galaxies that extends to the south of the Virgo Cluster. However, it is unclear whether the Sombrero Galaxy is part of a formal galaxy group. Hierarchical methods for identifying groups, which determine group membership by considering whether individual galaxies belong to a larger aggregate of galaxies, typically produce results showing that the Sombrero Galaxy is part of a group that includes NGC 4487, NGC 4504, NGC 4802, UGCA 289, and possibly a few other galaxies. However, results that rely on the percolation method (i.e. the \\"friends-of-friends\\" method), which links individual galaxies together to determine group membership, indicate that either the Sombrero Galaxy is not in a group or that it may only be part of a galaxy pair with UGCA 287. Besides that, M104 is also accompanied by an ultra-compact dwarf galaxy, that was discovered in 2009. This object has an absolute magnitude of ‚àí12.3, an effective radius of just , and a mass of 3.3* Amateur astronomy Amateur photograph of M104 The Sombrero Galaxy is located 11.5¬∞ west of Spica and 5.5¬∞ north-east of Eta Corvi. Although the galaxy is visible with 7√ó35 binoculars or a amateur telescope, an telescope is needed to distinguish the bulge from the disk, and a 10- or 12-inch (250 or 300 mm) telescope is needed to see the dark dust lane.

Behaviors are then directed towards avoiding frustrating events which, paradoxically, leads to increased frustration and even greater mental stress.

History  The concept was originally developed by psychologist Albert Ellis who theorized that low frustration tolerance is an evaluative component in dysfunctional and irrational beliefs. His theory of REBT proposes that irrational beliefs and the avoidance of stressful situations is the origin of behavioral and emotional problems. As humans, we tend to seek for instant gratification to avoid pain, ignoring the fact that evading a situation now, will make it more problematic later.  Types of hedonism  * Inferential hedonism: People's desires are regarding their own hedonic states of pleasure and pain. * Reinforcement Hedonism: The content of a person's desire, is reinforced because of the pleasure that imagining the specific desire brings.  Stress  According to REBT, the way we perceive stressful situations plays a role in how we experience stress. Stress exists as part of the nervous system of humans, and it affects humans' well-being when the degree of stress exceeds their capacity of managing the situation either temporarily or permanently.  Implications  LFT has been suggested as a main cause of procrastination. According to Dr. Sarah Edelman, LFT causes us to avoid difficult to endure situations and sometimes to avoid them altogether. This can be a problem because 'achieving many of the things that are important and worthwhile requires us to take actions that involve some discomfort.' Avoiding difficult situations and tasks can also prevent us from dealing constructively with problems, such as ending unpleasant relationships, improving unhealthy lifestyles, and moving on from dissatisfying jobs. Moreover, tasks perceived as boring, difficult or demanding of greater effort, are said to make a person more likely to procrastinate.  Reducing LFT  In REBT, reducing irrational beliefs and increasing rational beliefs can reduce LFT. This cognitive restructuring allows a modification of dysfunctional thinking and acting, and allows people to change thoughts of great distress like: * \\"Existing conditions must be changed to give me what I like, otherwise I can't stand it and I can't be happy at all!\\" * \\"I must have immediate gratification and have to have it, or else I can't stand it and my life is awful\\" * \\"I can't stand hassles\\" Into more rational and less exaggerated thoughts like: * \\"I don't like existing conditions\\" * \\"I would like immediate gratification\\" * \\"I find hassles and frustrations inconvenient\\"  LFT Scale  The frustration discomfort scale (FDS), a multidimensional measure for LFT, was developed using REBT theories. These dimensions were labelled in four categories: # Emotional intolerance, involving intolerance of emotional distress. # Entitlement, involving intolerance of unfairness and frustrated gratification. # Discomfort intolerance, involving intolerance of difficulties and hassles. # Achievement, involving intolerance of frustrated achievement goals. Increasing tolerance Ellis said the path to tolerance consisted of many roads, including unconditional self-acceptance, unconditional other-acceptance and unconditional life-acceptance.The Road To Tolerance, Albert Ellis, 2004, Prometheus Books, Conclusion (p211) See also * Frustration‚Äìaggression hypothesis References External links * REBT Network -- Albert Ellis and Rational Emotive Behavior Therapy * The Albert Ellis Institute Category:Abnormal psychology Category:Symptoms and signs: Cognition, perception, emotional state and behaviour ","title":"Low frustration tolerance"},{"id":"864438","text":"In geometry and combinatorics, an arrangement of hyperplanes is an arrangement of a finite set A of hyperplanes in a linear, affine, or projective space S. Questions about a hyperplane arrangement A generally concern geometrical, topological, or other properties of the complement, M(A), which is the set that remains when the hyperplanes are removed from the whole space. One may ask how these properties are related to the arrangement and its intersection semilattice. The intersection semilattice of A, written L(A), is the set of all subspaces that are obtained by intersecting some of the hyperplanes; among these subspaces are S itself, all the individual hyperplanes, all intersections of pairs of hyperplanes, etc. (excluding, in the affine case, the empty set). These intersection subspaces of A are also called the flats of A. The intersection semilattice L(A) is partially ordered by reverse inclusion. If the whole space S is 2-dimensional, the hyperplanes are lines; such an arrangement is often called an arrangement of lines. Historically, real arrangements of lines were the first arrangements investigated. If S is 3-dimensional one has an arrangement of planes. A hyperplane arrangement in space  General theory  = The intersection semilattice and the matroid = The intersection semilattice L(A) is a meet semilattice and more specifically is a geometric semilattice. If the arrangement is linear or projective, or if the intersection of all hyperplanes is nonempty, the intersection lattice is a geometric lattice. (This is why the semilattice must be ordered by reverse inclusion--rather than by inclusion, which might seem more natural but would not yield a geometric (semi)lattice.) When L(A) is a lattice, the matroid of A, written M(A), has A for its ground set and has rank function r(S) := codim(I), where S is any subset of A and I is the intersection of the hyperplanes in S. In general, when L(A) is a semilattice, there is an analogous matroid-like structure called a semimatroid, which is a generalization of a matroid (and has the same relationship to the intersection semilattice as does the matroid to the lattice in the lattice case), but is not a matroid if L(A) is not a lattice. = Polynomials = For a subset B of A, let us define f(B) := the intersection of the hyperplanes in B; this is S if B is empty. The characteristic polynomial of A, written pA(y), can be defined by :p_A(y) := \\\\sum_B (-1)^{B}y^{\\\\dim f(B)}, summed over all subsets B of A except, in the affine case, subsets whose intersection is empty. (The dimension of the empty set is defined to be ‚àí1.) This polynomial helps to solve some basic questions; see below. Another polynomial associated with A is the Whitney-number polynomial wA(x, y), defined by :w_A(x,y) := \\\\sum_B x^{n-\\\\dim f(B)} \\\\sum_C (-1)^{C-B}y^{\\\\dim f(C)}, summed over B ‚äÜ C ‚äÜ A such that f(B) is nonempty. Being a geometric lattice or semilattice, L(A) has a characteristic polynomial, pL(A)(y), which has an extensive theory (see matroid). Thus it is good to know that pA(y) = yi pL(A)(y), where i is the smallest dimension of any flat, except that in the projective case it equals yi + 1pL(A)(y). The Whitney-number polynomial of A is similarly related to that of L(A). (The empty set is excluded from the semilattice in the affine case specifically so that these relationships will be valid.) = The Orlik‚ÄìSolomon algebra = The intersection semilattice determines another combinatorial invariant of the arrangement, the Orlik‚ÄìSolomon algebra. To define it, fix a commutative subring K of the base field and form the exterior algebra E of the vector space :\\\\bigoplus_{H \\\\in A} K e_H generated by the hyperplanes. A chain complex structure is defined on E with the usual boundary operator \\\\partial. The Orlik‚ÄìSolomon algebra is then the quotient of E by the ideal generated by elements of the form e_{H_1} \\\\wedge \\\\cdots \\\\wedge e_{H_p} for which H_1, \\\\dots, H_p have empty intersection, and by boundaries of elements of the same form for which H_1 \\\\cap \\\\cdots \\\\cap H_p has codimension less than p.  Real arrangements  In real affine space, the complement is disconnected: it is made up of separate pieces called cells or regions or chambers, each of which is either a bounded region that is a convex polytope, or an unbounded region that is a convex polyhedral region which goes off to infinity. Each flat of A is also divided into pieces by the hyperplanes that do not contain the flat; these pieces are called the faces of A. The regions are faces because the whole space is a flat. The faces of codimension 1 may be called the facets of A. The face semilattice of an arrangement is the set of all faces, ordered by inclusion. Adding an extra top element to the face semilattice gives the face lattice. In two dimensions (i.e., in the real affine plane) each region is a convex polygon (if it is bounded) or a convex polygonal region which goes off to infinity. * As an example, if the arrangement consists of three parallel lines, the intersection semilattice consists of the plane and the three lines, but not the empty set. There are four regions, none of them bounded. * If we add a line crossing the three parallels, then the intersection semilattice consists of the plane, the four lines, and the three points of intersection. There are eight regions, still none of them bounded. * If we add one more line, parallel to the last, then there are 12 regions, of which two are bounded parallelograms. Typical problems about an arrangement in n-dimensional real space are to say how many regions there are, or how many faces of dimension 4, or how many bounded regions. These questions can be answered just from the intersection semilattice. For instance, two basic theorems, from Zaslavsky (1975), are that the number of regions of an affine arrangement equals (‚àí1)npA(‚àí1) and the number of bounded regions equals (‚àí1)npA(1). Similarly, the number of k-dimensional faces or bounded faces can be read off as the coefficient of xn‚àík in (‚àí1)n wA (‚àíx, ‚àí1) or (‚àí1)nwA(‚àíx, 1). designed a fast algorithm to determine the face of an arrangement of hyperplanes containing an input point. Another question about an arrangement in real space is to decide how many regions are simplices (the n-dimensional generalization of triangles and tetrahedra). This cannot be answered based solely on the intersection semilattice. The McMullen problem asks for the smallest arrangement of a given dimension in general position in real projective space for which there does not exist a cell touched by all hyperplanes. A real linear arrangement has, besides its face semilattice, a poset of regions, a different one for each region. This poset is formed by choosing an arbitrary base region, B0, and associating with each region R the set S(R) consisting of the hyperplanes that separate R from B. The regions are partially ordered so that R1 ‚â• R2 if S(R1, R) contains S(R2, R). In the special case when the hyperplanes arise from a root system, the resulting poset is the corresponding Weyl group with the weak Bruhat order. In general, the poset of regions is ranked by the number of separating hyperplanes and its M√∂bius function has been computed . Vadim Schechtman and Alexander Varchenko introduced a matrix indexed by the regions. The matrix element for the region R_i and R_j is given by the product of indeterminate variables a_H for every hyperplane H that separates these two regions. If these variables are specialized to be all value q, then this is called the q-matrix (over the Euclidean domain \\\\mathbb{Q}[q]) for the arrangement and much information is contained in its Smith normal form. Complex arrangements In complex affine space (which is hard to visualize because even the complex affine plane has four real dimensions), the complement is connected (all one piece) with holes where the hyperplanes were removed. A typical problem about an arrangement in complex space is to describe the holes. The basic theorem about complex arrangements is that the cohomology of the complement M(A) is completely determined by the intersection semilattice. To be precise, the cohomology ring of M(A) (with integer coefficients) is isomorphic to the Orlik‚ÄìSolomon algebra on Z. The isomorphism can be described explicitly and gives a presentation of the cohomology in terms of generators and relations, where generators are represented (in the de Rham cohomology) as logarithmic differential forms :\\\\frac{1}{2\\\\pi i}\\\\frac{d\\\\alpha}{\\\\alpha}. with \\\\alpha any linear form defining the generic hyperplane of the arrangement. Technicalities Sometimes it is convenient to allow the degenerate hyperplane, which is the whole space S, to belong to an arrangement. If A contains the degenerate hyperplane, then it has no regions because the complement is empty. However, it still has flats, an intersection semilattice, and faces. The preceding discussion assumes the degenerate hyperplane is not in the arrangement. Sometimes one wants to allow repeated hyperplanes in the arrangement. We did not consider this possibility in the preceding discussion, but it makes no material difference. See also *Supersolvable arrangement References * *. *. *. * *.

No real pattern exists for the numbering of highways. Route commissioning beyond these routes was by legislative action, thus the term legislative route. This included additions and revisions that took place when US and Interstate Highway Systems were commissioned. Minnesota state highway markers use Type D FHWA font for all route numbers and type C for three-digit route markers only if type D font cannot be used. All routes except interstates use or markers. Interstate markers for three-digit routes are wider shields, and respectively. Although Minnesota state highways do not follow a distinctive pattern in numbering, they are numbered to avoid conflicting with Interstate Highways and US Highways. Any instance of a state number that matches one is often a continuation of the particular route (e.g., U.S. Route 169 and Trunk Highway 169). The Minnesota Department of Transportation (MnDOT) does not consider this a violation of the rule. List of highways  Other state highways  There are also routes officially numbered in the 805 and 905, but they do not have signage. Examples include part of the Sibley Memorial Highway that was bypassed in Mendota in the mid 1995 (MN 913A, numbered for former designation MN 13), and Robert Street between I-494 and University Avenue in St. Paul and West St. Paul (MN 952, numbered for former designation US 52). Other roads under Minnesota jurisdiction include the MN 371 Business Route, which follows the former route of MN 371 through Brainerd. MN 23 also has a designated business route through the city of Willmar (as MN 23 is bypassed around the city), but unlike Business MN 371, Business MN 23 is under local jurisdiction. Legislative routes defined in the Minnesota Constitution were signed until 1934, when many were renumbered. Several routes, like US Highway 208, were planned in the 1934 renumbering but eliminated before the final plan.

The character, who first appeared in Adventure Comics #283 (April 1961), was created by Robert Bernstein and initially designed by George Papp. As a Kryptonian, he exhibits the same powers and abilities as Superman and is consequently viewed as one of his greatest enemies alongside Lex Luthor and Brainiac. Originally depicted as bald and clean-shaven, Zod's look in popular culture was defined by the character's depiction by Terence Stamp in the films, Superman and Superman II starring Christopher Reeve. Eventually, the character was reintroduced the DC Multiverse with black hair and a goatee beard. This character was portrayed by Michael Shannon as the main villain in Zack Snyder's film, Man of Steel (2013). Publication history =Silver Age= Dru-Zod is a megalomaniacal Kryptonian, in charge of the military forces on Krypton. He knew Jor-El, Superman's father, when Jor-El was an aspiring scientist. When the space program was abolished after the destruction of the inhabited moon Wegthor (engineered by renegade scientist Jax-Ur), Zod attempted to take over Krypton. Zod created an army of robotic duplicates of himself, all bearing a resemblance to Bizarro. He was sentenced to exile in the Phantom Zone for 40 years for his crimes. Zod was eventually released by Superman when his term of imprisonment was up. However, he attempted to conquer Earth with the superpowers his Kryptonian body acquired under the yellow sun (the source of Superman's own super-powers). With Zod's threat now obvious, Superman was forced to oppose him and ultimately returned him to the Zone. During the remaining years before the Crisis on Infinite Earths, Zod and other Zone inmates such as Jax-Ur, Faora Hu-Ul and others, escaped from the Phantom Zone and battled Superman and Supergirl numerous times, always being defeated in the end and returned to the Zone. =Modern Age= Interim Zods: 1985‚Äì2005 After DC's continuity altering crossover special Crisis on Infinite Earths (1985), DC editorial maintained for a number of years that no Kryptonians were to be depicted in comics aside from Superman, to reinforce his status as the last Kryptonian. This meant that characters like Supergirl and Power Girl were reimagined and Superman's Kryptonian canine Krypto became an ordinary house pet. However, writers of DC Comics still attempted to get around the no-Kryptonians rule by introducing \\"new\\" versions of Zod. Many of these were Zods of alternate universes. None persisted in DC continuity. After publishing its sequel to Crisis on Infinite Earths, Infinite Crisis (2005), DC reintroduced the real General Zod in its 2006-2008 storyline Superman: Last Son. For this, it brought on board writer Richard Donner, director of Superman, the film which introduced Zod to the moviegoing public. General Zod in The Adventures of Superman #589 (April 2001). Art by Duncan Rouleau and Marlo Alquiza. The first Zod to be introduced following Crisis on Infinite Earths was the Zod of a so-called \\"pocket universe\\" resembling the universe in which the comics took place; this allowed for a \\"Kryptonian\\" Zod to be introduced while maintaining Superman's status as the last of his race in the universe proper. This Zod came from a Krypton in a pocket universe, the universe itself having been created by the Time Trapper. Zod (along with companions Quex-Ul and Zaora) devastated the Earth of that universe following the death of its Superboy, despite the best efforts of a Supergirl created by that world's heroic Lex Luthor. Eventually, the survivors of this world managed to contact the Superman of the main universe to help them, and he was able to take away the powers of the three super-criminals with only Gold Kryptonite (since he was not from that universe, the Kryptonite of that reality would have no effect on him). However, the three vowed to some day regain their powers and return to Superman's world to kill him. Acknowledging that he could neither afford to leave them on the now-dead pocket Earth to let them die on their own nor imprison them on his world, Superman was forced to execute them with Green Kryptonite.Superman (vol. 2) #22 (October 1988) A second incarnation of General Zod was introduced in the 2001 storyline \\"Return to Krypton\\"; this Zod was portrayed as that of an alternate reality that was created by the character Brainiac 13.Adventures of Superman #589 (April 2001) He was the head of the Kryptonian military in the alternate reality. Like the Pre-Crisis version, Zod held the Kryptonian equivalent of fascist beliefs. He sent aliens to the bottle city of Kandor and planned a military coup. Zod was defeated by Superman and the Jor-El of Zod's alternate reality Krypton.Action Comics (vol. 1) #776 (April 2001) The third attempt to bring Zod to Modern Age comics was the \\"Russian\\" Zod, a Zod of human origin whose origin story was connected to Superman's. This General Zod (born Avruiskin) is a Russian who was affected before his birth by Kryptonite radiation, since he was the son of two cosmonauts whose ship was too close to Kal-El's rocketship. This Zod is unnaturally weak under a yellow sun, but superpowered under a red sun (the opposite of Superman). After his parents died from radiation, he grew up in a KGB laboratory under the name \\"Zed\\". Apparently spoken to by the spirit of the Pocket Universe Zod, Russian Zod created a suit of red armor which filtered the sunlight, and declared himself ruler of the fictional former Soviet state of Pokolistan. After several inconclusive encounters with Superman, he revealed his long-range plan to turn the sun red and take Superman's place. This was temporarily successful until Lex Luthor rescued Superman, gave him a blast of yellow solar radiation to regain his powers, and worked to restore the sun. Superman returned to battle Zod, but refused to kill him. When the sun turned yellow again the now-vulnerable Zod struck Superman with all his power at super-speed, but was killed due to Superman's invulnerability. The final Zod before the character was finally reintroduced, the Zod of an alternate Phantom Zone appeared in the twelve-issue For Tomorrow storyline, written by Brian Azzarello and penciled by Jim Lee.Superman #204‚Äì215 This Zod lives alone in an alternate Phantom Zone and resents Superman for tampering with it.Superman #206 By his own account he comes from the same Krypton as Superman and was exiled to the Phantom Zone by Superman's father, Jor-El. This Zod wears large, spiked black armor and when unmasked, is a bald, white- bearded old man. This incarnation also uses a variation of \\"Kneel before Zod\\". He appeared in Metropia, a version of the Phantom Zone created by Superman to resemble a living world (including apparently-living beings). After this storyline, he has been superseded by the present storyline (which features a new Zod, freed from the Phantom Zone).Superman #214 General Zod returns: 2006‚Äì2011 General Zod appeared in the Superman: Last Son storyline (written by Geoff Johns and Richard Donner, the director of Superman: The Movie and most of Superman II). In a similar story to that of Superman II, Zod, Ursa, and Non escape from the Phantom Zone and come to Earth to try to turn it into a \\"New Krypton\\".Action Comics #844 This incarnation is the first Post-Crisis Zod who came from Superman's Krypton, and not from an alternate reality.Action Comics #845 General Zod leads an ill-fated insurrection in Countdown #30 (October 2007). Art by Gary Frank and Jon Sibal. The backstory for the three Kryptonians was recounted in Action Comics Annual #10 (April 2007),Action Comics Annual #10 and Zod's origin was revealed in Countdown #30 (October 2007).Countdown #30 Prior to the destruction of Krypton, Zod, his wife Ursa, and accomplice Non rebelled against their planet's oppressive government, but soon became lawless would-be tyrants who lusted for power. After an ill-fated insurrection led by Zod, the government sentenced the trio to death. However, Superman's father Jor-El pleaded for the government to mitigate their sentence to imprisonment in the Phantom Zone, accepted on the condition that he would assume responsibility as their jailer. While in the Phantom Zone, Zod and Ursa were able to have a child who was born immune to the Phantom Zone's effects, ultimately facilitating their escape, and named him Lor-Zod. On Earth, the boy was discovered by Superman and his wife Lois Lane, who adopted him as their own son and named him Christopher Kent. For the duration of 2007's \\"Last Son\\" storyline in Action Comics, Chris Kent is depicted as an adopted son of Superman and his wife Lois across DC titles. Alongside Zod, Ursa and Non, 25 other Kryptonian criminals also escape the Zone and defeat a number of Earth's heroes, beginning their quest to conquer the planet. Zod ambushes Superman in revenge for Jor-El's actions and traps him in the Phantom Zone, which he later escapes with the help of the heroic Phantom Zone prisoner Mon-El. With assistance from his traditional enemies Lex Luthor, Metallo, Parasite and Bizarro, Superman takes on Zod's army. Out of nearly thirty Kryptonians, Superman's temporary allies successfully kill several, driving the rest back into the Phantom Zone alongside Zod and Ursa, who take Chris Kent with them.Action Comics #846 General Zod in Action Comics #845 (January 2007). Art by Adam Kubert. In the later \\"New Krypton\\" arc storyline however, Zod is freed from the Phantom Zone once again by Supergirl's mother Alura. The \\"bottled city of Kandor\\" is transformed into a populated Kryptonian planet (\\"New Krypton\\"), and Zod is appointed the leader of its army. In the \\"World of New Krypton\\" Action Comics storyline, when Superman decides to see what life is like on New Krypton, he is drafted into the Military Guild under General Zod. Zod and Superman maintain a mistrustful professional relationship. Despite their past, neither seems prepared to behave with marked aggression toward the other. Later, during a Kryptonian ceremony, Zod is shot by the Kryptonian Ral-Dar (who is working with Lois's father General Sam Lane), leading Zod to appoint Superman as temporary General until his recovery. The two are involved in a Kryptonian political plot, but ultimately apprehend the planet's traitor and see a reform of New Krypton's Council. Peace is short-lived, however, due to an attack by the alien Brainiac, who had been responsible for the bottling of Kandor in the first place. In \\"Last Stand of New Krypton\\", New Krypton comes under attack by Brainiac, and Zod engineers a plan to defeat him; Zod is driven by an urge to avenge his prior defeat at the hands of the Coluan Brainiac, when Kandor was bottled from Old Krypton. The storyline ends with the planet's destruction, leading Zod to declare war on Earth, sparking the \\"War of the Supermen\\" storyline. After a fierce conflict between Superman and Zod in defence of Earth, Zod is pushed back into the Phantom Zone by his son, Chris Kent, who had freed himself from the Phantom Zone and became active as an adult superhero on planet Earth.Superman: War of the Supermen #4 (July 2010) The New 52: 2011‚Äì2016 In 2011, DC chose to revamp its continuity, rebooting many characters while retaining the histories for some others, as part of its The New 52 publishing event. Following this, Zod is hinted at several times. A character resembling Zod made a cameo in Action Comics #5 (March 2012), as a prisoner in the Phantom Zone; in Action Comics #13 (December 2012) a ghost in the Phantom Zone says \\"Kneel before...\\" multiple times while attacking Superman, a reference to Zod's iconic saying. Zod makes his first full appearance in Action Comics #23.2: General Zod (September 2013), written by Greg Pak, with art by Ken Lashley. A new origin for Zod was introduced. Zod was born to scientist parents. When he was a young boy, Zod and his parents traveled to Krypton's wilderness in order to discover new creatures. Their ship was attacked by creatures, leaving the family stranded in the jungle. While his parents were killed by the animals, Zod managed to survive for one year until Jor-El and his older brother Zor-El saved him. After reaching adulthood, Zod became one of Krypton's best soldiers, attaining the rank of general. Zod developed a hatred towards an alien species called the Char and secretly ordered the creation of a Char-looking creature, unleashing it on Krypton's population, so he could justify a war against the Char. Jor-El discovered the deception and turned Zod over to the authorities. The council found Zod guilty of treason and banished him and his closest followers, Faora and Non, to the Phantom Zone. Many years later, a mysterious event caused the Phantom Zone to weaken, allowing some of its prisoners to escape into normal space. Zod traveled to Earth, landing in the Sahara Desert. There, Zod's Kryptonian powers began to manifest for the first time, brutally slaughtering a group of travelers. Zod was soon attacked by the Justice League of America until Superman and Wonder Woman arrived, the latter restraining him with her magic lasso. Zod recognized Superman as Kal-El, the son of Jor-El. Superman decided to keep Zod in the Fortress of Solitude's alien zoo. While there, he reveals to Superman that Faora also traveled to Earth with him, and vows to track her down. General Zod as he appears in the DC Universe. Cover of Suicide Squad vol. 5, #17 (July 2017). Art by Tony Daniel and Sandu Florea. DC Universe In June 2016, the DC Rebirth event relaunched DC Comics' entire line of comic book titles, in which General Zod continues to appear within DC titles. In December 2017, DC Comics ended the Rebirth branding, opting to include everything under a larger DC Universe banner and naming. As part of the DC Rebirth relaunch, General Zod is once again imprisoned within the Phantom Zone. Zod was trapped within the boundaries of the Black Vault, a secret facility hidden in the Laptev Sea. Amanda Waller sent the Suicide Squad to steal the contents of the Black Vault and bring them back to her; however, in unlocking the previously hermetically sealed area, they unwittingly allowed Zod to tear open the now unstable link between Earth and the Phantom Zone and once again break free. She attempts to 'recruit' Zod by implanting a kryptonite explosive in his head, but he finally proves too dangerous, forcing Rick Flag to sacrifice himself to force Zod back into the Zone. Zod later escapes and establishes himself as a dictator on another planet with his family, nearly killing Hal Jordan when the Green Lantern Corps discover his presence on the planet before both sides are forced to withdraw and recuperate. Powers and abilities Like all Kryptonians under a yellow sun, General Zod possesses high-level superhuman strength, speed and endurance sufficient to stand against Superman and other Kryptonians; super hearing; x-ray vision; telescopic, microscopic and heat vision; super-breath and freeze-breath; virtual invulnerability; accelerated healing and flight. Due to his background as a Kryptonian general, Zod possesses a detailed knowledge of military tactics, battle strategy, and is a relatively competent military leader. Because he was trained in fighting arts long before receiving his abilities, he typically has an edge over Superman's brawling skills, over- reliance on superhuman strength, and basic knowledge of advanced human and Kryptonian hand-to-hand combat. However, Zod's powers are often inferior to those of Superman, due to the latter being exposed to the yellow sun over the course of his entire life, while Zod typically only gets exposed for a short period of time before being defeated and returned to the Phantom Zone. This greater power combined with his superior control and experience with it gives Superman an edge over Zod's superior fighting skills. Additionally, similar to Superman, his strength is inferior to the likes of Doomsday and his speed is inferior to Speedsters such as the Flash. Like all Kryptonians, he is vulnerable to Kryptonite and red solar radiation; his durability does not provide protection from mind control and magic; and his strength and durability both have limits in that he cannot survive an atomic explosion without nearly fatal injuries and there are weights he cannot lift due to natural bodily limitation even under the empowering environment of a yellow sun as well as normal limits of adult Kryptonian superhuman strength. Other versions * The General Zod of Earth-15 is this world's Superman, here as a semi-retired champion of this peaceful Earth.Countdown #24 This version is later killed by the psychotic Superman Prime, who was angry because Zod was \\"not a manic\\", as well as killing Zod's wife and unborn child. Countdown to Final Crisis #30 * The Zod of JSA: The Liberty Files was not a general of any kind. He was recast as a sociopathic 11-year-old, who created a deadly synthetic virus on Krypton for no reason other than fun. Zod was banished to the Phantom Zone because of his actions (the first child ever sent to the Zone) until American scientists breached the Zone and discovered him. Taken in by the government and named \\"Clark Kent\\", Zod would fool most of his adult superiors by playing the role of a scared child until he grew up and became the adult \\"Super-Man\\".JSA: The Libert Files #2 In the sequel series JSA: The Unholy Three, Super-Man is sent into Eastern Europe with the Bat and the Clock. He fought Parasite and Steelwolf, while investigating his sole weakness: a nuclear device the Russians had created. Finding his information, he incapacitated or killed several agents and headed into Russia to destroy the device. However, he was ultimately killed before he could finish the job. JSA: The Unholy Three * Zod appears in Superman: Earth One in which he is called Zod-El, brother to Jor-El and thus Superman's uncle. Zod-El was a Kryptonian soldier who waged a six-month civil war against the Science Council, and the one responsible for Krypton's destruction by striking a deal with the Krypton's neighbor Dheronians. After Tyrell's defeat and absorbing energy from a yellow star, Zod went to Earth to deal with Superman. He is later depowered by the Luthors after Alexander shot him with a radiation beam, but not before killing him and thus driving his wife Lex to hate Superman. * Zod appears in the prequel to the Injustice 2 video game. When Batman and the Insurgency rescue the Teen Titans from their imprisonment by Superman in the Phantom Zone, Zod uses the opportunity to escape the prison and murders Tim Drake in the process. An enraged Batman activates his Endgame protocol and combats Zod with a heavily armored suit. He takes Zod down with kryptonite infused fear gas, which Batman himself swore he'd never use given to what it did to Superman in this reality. He gets the upper hand on Zod with the kryptonite gas making it appear like Superman is defeating him, but when it wears off, Ra's Al Ghul (knowing Zod's kryptonian purist ideals wouldn't match with his own) sends Amazo to combat the general. Amazo kills Zod by twisting his head off.Injustice 2 #39 His heart is then surgically removed by the retired Doctor Mid-Nite Charles McNider and placed inside Superboy's body so he can live outside the Phantom Zone. =DC Animated Universe= * While not appearing in the DC animated universe television shows, General Zod (depicted as an Argosian mad criminal) appears in Superman Adventures #21Superman Adventures #21 and Justice League Unlimited #34 where he teams with Jax-Ur and Mala.Justice League Unlimited #34 * A version of Zod appears in the 2013 digital-first series Justice League Beyond 2.0, taking place in the DC Animated Universe, specifically in the futuristic setting of the Batman Beyond animated series. In this series, Zod is revealed to be the son of Jax-Ur, marking the first appearance of General Zod in the continuity of the Bruce Timm's Superman: The Animated Series, albeit a younger, innocent version of the megalomaniacal General who, in fact, helps the new Justice League. He is later revealed to be the son of Justice Lord Superman and Wonder Woman. In other media =Television= Animation * General Zod appears in the 1988 animated series Superman episode \\"The Hunter\\", voiced by Ren√© Auberjonois. This version is imprisoned in the Phantom Zone with two Kryptonian women (Ursa and Faora) whereas most portrayals of the conspiracy show the Zod trio composed of two men and one woman. While in the Phantom Zone, Zod and his followers create The Hunter (a creature which can transmute itself into any substance that it touches) and send it to Earth. After the Hunter's fight with Superman, Zod introduces it to Kryptonite where the Hunter ends up seeking a piece of Kryptonite that is in Lex Luthor's possession. During the fight with the Hunter, Superman plays dead by going into a suspended animation thanks to a device he gave to Lois Lane. After being awoken from his suspended animation, Superman destroys the Hunter and uses the Phantom Zone Projector to ensure that Zod stays in the Phantom Zone. * General Zod does not appear in Superman: The Animated Series, but an amalgamation of him and Jax-Ur appears, called General Jax-Ur. He first appeared in the episode 'Blasts From the Past', where he was voiced by Ron Perlman. He was portrayed as similar to General Zod; a military genius who had attempted to overthrow the Science Council. His co-conspirator, and possible lover, is a beautiful Kryptonian female with long white hair named Mala (based on Ursa and Faora but named for a male Kryptonian from the comics). His proper title is High General Jax-Ur. During Jax-Ur and Mala's last appearance on Superman: The Animated Series, Jax-Ur reveals to Superman that a rift into the Phantom Zone had been torn open, releasing them into space. They were saved by nearby voyagers and soon took control over their planet. Upon seizing control of the planet, they had the inhabitants rebuild everything so that it was very reminiscent of Krypton, even going so far as to make the inhabitants wear clothes similar to that of Kryptonians. After meeting with a rebel, Superman found out that Jax-Ur and Mala intended to invade Earth. After Superman battled in space with the pair, Jax-Ur and Mala were sucked into a black hole. * The Silver Age version of Zod makes a cameo appearance in the Legion of Super Heroes episode \\"Phantoms\\". He is one of the many Phantom Zone prisoners attacking the Legion of Super-Heroes, his son Drax-Zod appears in this episode, voiced by Greg Ellis. * General Zod appears in the Justice League Action episode \\"Field Trip\\", voiced by Jason J. Lewis. As Superman gives Blue Beetle, Firestorm, and Stargirl a tour of the Fortress of Solitude and are shown the Phantom Zone Projector, General Zod, Faora, and Quex-Ul are released and Superman is accidentally sent to the Phantom Zone. Blue Beetle, Firestorm, and Stargirl attempt to use a Green Kryptonite fragment on them only for it to be too small for them. Under the yellow sun, General Zod and his two followers gain superpowers and end up in a fight with Blue Beetle, Firestorm, and Stargirl. As Blue Beetle and Stargirl hold off the Kryptonian villains, Firestorm uses Martin Stein's guidance to learn how to transmutate anything to Kryptonite. Testing on the ice, Firestorm transmutates it to Green Kryptonite which weakens General Zod and his two followers. Afterwards, Superman is freed from the Phantom Zone and General Zod and his followers are thrown into the Phantom Zone. * General Zod appears in The Looney Tunes Show episode \\"SuperRabbit\\" where he is modeled after Daffy Duck (voiced by Jeff Bergman). Here, he is Faora's boyfriend, but is inattentive and neglectful of her, as well as immature. Zod, Faora, and the robot Thunkian are first prosecuted for their crimes on Krypton by Jor-El and sentenced to the Phantom Zone, swearing revenge. After escaping several years later, they travel to Metropolis and battle SuperRabbit, defeating him and forcing him to retreat. Zod then becomes the city's ruler and renames himself King Zod, ordering a massive statue of himself built. SuperRabbit returns and convinces Faora and Thunkian to stop helping Zod by pointing out how much he mistreats them. Zod and SuperRabbit have a massive battle throughout the city where Zod is eventually knocked out by having his own statue knocked onto him. Zod and his followers are then sent back to the Phantom Zone. The entire adventure was actually a false story Bugs Bunny was telling Daffy Duck; the naive Daffy believes every word of it. * General Zod appears in DC Super Hero Girls episode \\"\\"#DCSuperHeroBoys\\" (voiced by Liam O'Brien). Here, he is based on his film appearance from Superman: The Movie and Superman II. A rift is opened to the Phantom Zone and he is released, along with Ursa and Zod. Zod and crew battle the DC Super Hero Girls and the \\"Invicibros\\" (a team consisting of Green Lantern, Hawkman, Aqualad, the Flash, and Green Arrow) in Metropolis. Live-action alt=Zod in the TV program Smallville, wearing a black athletic shirt, camouflage pants and Kryptonian dog-tags * In Lois and Clark: The New Adventures of Superman, a Zod pastiche appeared in the Season 4 premiere \\"Lord of the Flys\\" as Lord Nor, played by Simon Templeman. He was later killed along with his cohorts by a corrupt Colonel named Cash with a kryptonite warhead outside the Daily Planet brawling Superman. * Zod appears in the television series Smallville with references to the character start in the fifth season premiere, in which Zod's Kryptonian disciples Aethyr and Nam-Ek search for Clark Kent (a.k.a. Kal-El). The season finale concludes with BrainIAC, a corrupted humanoid Kryptonian artificial intelligence, turning Lex Luthor into a superpowered vessel for General Zod, who was imprisoned in the Phantom Zone as a powerless disembodied wraith. In the sixth season premiere, Clark sends Zod's spirit once again in the Phantom Zone. Season eight introduces a version of Doomsday named Davis Bloome (portrayed by Sam Witwer), a creature/\\"son\\" with hybrid DNA of Zod, Faora and several aggressive Kryptonian lifeforms. The season finale concludes with the Kryptonian Orb bringing to life a version of Zod (portrayed by an uncredited Sam Witwer). Witwer's contract gave him the option to return in Season 9 as Zod in the event the show was renewed. Though he considered his time on the show enjoyable and was flattered by the offer to stay on, he ultimately passed on the role as he felt it would be difficult for both the characters and audience to accept.https://www.cbr.com/smallvilles-a-tale-of- two-zods/amp/ :* Season nine introduces the character as a younger version of Zod known as Major Zod (portrayed by Callum Blue); he and other Kryptonian soldiers from the Kryptonian city of Kandor are resurrected on Earth as powerless clones. Despite Clark's attempts to help the Kandorians live in peace and prevent him from becoming evil, Major Zod's powers are eventually restored and he reactivates the powers of the Kandorian soldiers to earn their loyalty. He ultimately chooses to fulfill the destiny of the original Zod by embarking on a plan to rule Earth. In the season finale, Clark turns the Kandorian soldiers on Zod by exposing his murder of Faora and uses the Book of Rao to send the Kandorians to \\"New Krypton\\", an uninhabited planet discovered by Jor-El where they can establish a Kryptonian colony. In the tenth season episode \\"Dominion\\", it is revealed that the Kandorians sent Major Zod to the Phantom Zone as punishment, where he and the original Zod's wraith united as one with memories of both. He lured Clark and Oliver Queen into the Phantom Zone, but they managed to escape and destroy the exit, sealing Zod and his minions inside forever. * General Zod appears in the season 2 finale of Supergirl, portrayed by Mark Gibbon. Under a Silver Kryptonite-induced hallucination, Superman believes Supergirl is General Zod, his worst enemy, leading to a massive battle between the two until he is defeated and cured of the Silver Kryptonite. In the episode \\"For Good\\", Winn mentions that General Zod was killed by Superman, while Mon-El mentioned that The Legion battled him in the future, therefore implying that Zod will be resurrected at some point later. * A time-traveling General Dru-Zod appears in Krypton, portrayed by Colin Salmon. This version of the character is the son of Lyta-Zod and Seg-El, who is the father and grandfather to Jor-El and Kal-El respectively. Therefore, Zod and Jor-El are half-brothers, and Zod would be Kal-El's uncle, as in the Superman: Earth One canon. =Film= Original series (1978-2006) alt=General Zod, Non (both bearded) and Ursa in the film Superman II * General Zod appears in Superman: The Movie (1978) and Superman II (1980), portrayed by actor Terence Stamp. Zod first appears in the flashback to Krypton where he, Ursa and Non are sentenced by Jor-El of the Science Council to isolation in the Phantom Zone. He is eventually freed in the sequel where they begin a takeover of Earth and meet a newly escaped Lex Luthor, that guides them to the Daily Planet. He is eventually defeated when Superman lures Zod and his henchmen to the Fortress of Solitude and tricks them into a chamber designed to remove Kryptonian powers. This portrayal is rated #58 on Wizard magazine's \\"100 Greatest Villains of All Time\\" list.Wizard #177 Zod is notably the only other villain to appear in the film series originating from the comics beyond Lex Luthor. * During the early development of Superman Returns, film director Brett Ratner wanted Zod to appear. He wanted English actor Jude Law for the role, but Law turned down the role when Bryan Singer entered to direct the project after Ratner's departure to direct X-Men: The Last Stand.http://www.slashfilm.com/jude-law-superman-story/ As a result, Zod was omitted from the final script.http://screenrant.com/bryan- singer-superman-returns-criticism-darseid-sequel/ DC Extended Universe Michael Shannon as General Zod in Man of Steel (2013) * General Zod appears in the Zack Snyder film Man of Steel (2013) as the main antagonist of the film, played by Michael Shannon. This version is from Kandor and is the head of Krypton's Military Guild, who becomes so dissatisfied with the Law Council's decisions that he initiates a rebellion, for which he and his forces (called \\"The Sword of Rao\\") are captured and sentenced to the Phantom Zone, only to escape due to the destruction of Krypton also resulting in the destruction of their prison. Thirty-three years later, after the destruction of Krypton, Zod arrives on the planet Earth and extorts its people into handing over Kal-El (now going by the name Clark Kent) by threatening Earth's destruction. He reveals his plan to terraform Earth and repopulate the world with genetically- engineered Kryptonians, which will kill all of Earth's indigenous life in the process. Clark Kent (now dubbed \\"Superman\\"), with the help of the United States Military, thwarts his plan by creating a singularity that sucks all Kryptonians (save for Zod and Superman) back into the Phantom Zone. Zod then engages Superman in a lengthy, catastrophic fight throughout Metropolis and despite holding an upper hand throughout most of it, Superman ultimately subdues Zod. Furious, the General prepares to murder a trapped family and claims he will never stop, forcing Superman to reluctantly snap Zod's neck to save the family, killing him. * In Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice, LexCorp has possession of Zod's corpse, ostensibly to study Kryptonian anatomy and origins. Lex Luthor discovers Kryptonians' vulnerability to kryptonite and uses this knowledge and Zod's fingerprints to access the ancient Kryptonian scout ship. Using Zod's body and his own blood, Luthor creates a \\"Kryptonian Deformity\\". Animated * In the alternate world of Justice League: Gods and Monsters, Zod (voiced by Bruce Thomas) causes the destruction of Krypton by drilling the planet for its core in order to have the energy needed for his war machine and stops Jor-El from implanting his genetic code onto the egg created by Lara. Knowing the planet is about to blow up, Zod touches it to implant his genetic code, leading that world's version of Superman to grow up to look and behave more like Zod. Growing up, Superman is under the impression that his father was a good man due to having limited knowledge about Krypton. After being told about Zod, Superman calls his father a madman. * General Zod appears in The Lego Batman Movie. He makes a brief cameo on CNN News in a clip showing Superman fighting him and then projecting him up into the Phantom Zone. However, he is not present in the Phantom Zone scenes afterwards. =Video games= * The 1988 Superman NES game has Zod, Ursa, and Non as the final bosses whom Superman must defeat in order to win the game. The fight takes place at the fictional Statue of Freedom in Metropolis, based on the Statue of Liberty. * General Zod appears in the DC Universe Online video game, voiced by Alexander Brandon. * General Zod appears in Lego Batman 2: DC Super Heroes, voiced by Townsend Coleman. * General Zod appears as a downloadable character in the video game Injustice: Gods Among Us, voiced by Nolan North. Michael Shannon's character in Man of Steel is available as an alternate costume. In General Zod's ending, his prolonged time in the Phantom Zone allowed him to find out that he can create small Phantom Zone portals from one of the Phantom Zone inhabitants. Once he escaped, he trapped the One-Earth High Councilor Superman in the Phantom Zone and took his place in the One- Earth government planning to remake Earth into Krypton's image. * The Man of Steel incarnation of General Zod appears via DLC as a playable character in Lego Batman 3: Beyond Gotham. * General Zod appears in Lego Dimensions, voiced again by Nolan North. He appears as a minion of Lord Vortech and is the boss of the level, \\"The Phantom Zone\\", which takes place in the Ghostbusters universe. * General Zod is mentioned by Supergirl in Injustice 2 when she compares Superman's tyrannical methods to his. Superman later responds that Krypton would be alive if Jor-El were more like Zod to which Supergirl asks if Superman is the son of Jor-El or Zod. He makes a cameo in Sub-Zero's character ending, as the League accidentally opens a portal to the Phantom Zone and unleashes Zod, Ursa, Non, and Superman when they tried to send Sub-Zero back to his home dimension. * General Zod appears as a playable character in Lego DC Super-Villains. =Novels= In the novel The Last Days of Krypton (by Kevin J. Anderson, ), General Zod (also known as Commissioner Dru-Zod) is the son of Cor-Zod (former head of the Kryptonian Council). Initially a middle- level bureaucrat, he takes advantage of a major planetary cataclysm and the apparent decapitation of the government to seize absolute power as a military despot. He is ultimately overthrown by a resistance movement led by scientist Jor-El and his brother, civic leader Zor-El. They had formerly worked with Zod until his ambitions and misuse of Jor-El's Rao Beam and the Phantom Zone showed them his true nature and turned them against him. He and his two henchmen are banished forever to the Phantom Zone. The reactionary Council, however, decide to make sure Zod can never be released and, in doing so, snatch defeat from the jaws of victory. What the comet, pressures building up within Krypton and Rao's increasing instability fail to accomplish, is ironically achieved by the actions of Krypton's Council out of an irrational fear that Jor-El might free Zod and his minions.  Reception  Total Film ranked Zod #32 on their \\"Top 50 Greatest Villains of All Time\\" list in 2007.

In the mathematical field of geometric topology, a handlebody is a decomposition of a manifold into standard pieces. Handlebodies play an important role in Morse theory, cobordism theory and the surgery theory of high-dimensional manifolds. Handles are used to particularly study 3-manifolds. Handlebodies play a similar role in the study of manifolds as simplicial complexes and CW complexes play in homotopy theory, allowing one to analyze a space in terms of individual pieces and their interactions. n-dimensional handlebodies If (W,\\\\partial W) is an n-dimensional manifold with boundary, and :S^{r-1} \\\\times D^{n-r} \\\\subset \\\\partial W (where S^{n} represents an n-sphere and D^n is an n-ball) is an embedding, the n-dimensional manifold with boundary :(W',\\\\partial W') = ((W \\\\cup( D^r \\\\times D^{n-r})),(\\\\partial W - S^{r-1} \\\\times D^{n-r})\\\\cup (D^r \\\\times S^{n-r-1})) is said to be obtained from :(W,\\\\partial W) by attaching an r-handle. The boundary \\\\partial W' is obtained from \\\\partial W by surgery. As trivial examples, note that attaching a 0-handle is just taking a disjoint union with a ball, and that attaching an n-handle to (W,\\\\partial W) is gluing in a ball along any sphere component of \\\\partial W. Morse theory was used by Thom and Milnor to prove that every manifold (with or without boundary) is a handlebody, meaning that it has an expression as a union of handles. The expression is non-unique: the manipulation of handlebody decompositions is an essential ingredient of the proof of the Smale h-cobordism theorem, and its generalization to the s-cobordism theorem. A manifold is called a \\"k-handlebody\\" if it is the union of r-handles, for r at most k. This is not the same as the dimension of the manifold. For instance, a 4-dimensional 2-handlebody is a union of 0-handles, 1-handles and 2-handles. Any manifold is an n-handlebody, that is, any manifold is the union of handles. It isn't too hard to see that a manifold is an (n-1)-handlebody if and only if it has non- empty boundary. Any handlebody decomposition of a manifold defines a CW complex decomposition of the manifold, since attaching an r-handle is the same, up to homotopy equivalence, as attaching an r-cell. However, a handlebody decomposition gives more information than just the homotopy type of the manifold. For instance, a handlebody decomposition completely describes the manifold up to homeomorphism. In dimension four, they even describe the smooth structure, as long as the attaching maps are smooth. This is false in higher dimensions; any exotic sphere is the union of a 0-handle and an n-handle. 3-dimensional handlebodies A handlebody can be defined as an orientable 3-manifold-with-boundary containing pairwise disjoint, properly embedded 2-discs such that the manifold resulting from cutting along the discs is a 3-ball. It's instructive to imagine how to reverse this process to get a handlebody. (Sometimes the orientability hypothesis is dropped from this last definition, and one gets a more general kind of handlebody with a non- orientable handle.) The genus of a handlebody is the genus of its boundary surface. Up to homeomorphism, there is exactly one handlebody of any non- negative integer genus. The importance of handlebodies in 3-manifold theory comes from their connection with Heegaard splittings. The importance of handlebodies in geometric group theory comes from the fact that their fundamental group is free. A 3-dimensional handlebody is sometimes, particularly in older literature, referred to as a cube with handles. Examples Let G be a connected finite graph embedded in Euclidean space of dimension n. Let V be a closed regular neighborhood of G in the Euclidean space. Then V is an n-dimensional handlebody. The graph G is called a spine of V. Any genus zero handlebody is homeomorphic to the three-ball B3. A genus one handlebody is homeomorphic to B2 √ó S1 (where S1 is the circle) and is called a solid torus. All other handlebodies may be obtained by taking the boundary- connected sum of a collection of solid tori.

Affected individuals may have no symptoms or may experience signs and symptoms of liver disease such as yellow discoloration of the skin and eyes, itching, and abdominal pain. The bile duct scarring which occurs in PSC narrows the ducts of the biliary tree and impedes the flow of bile to the intestines. Eventually, it can lead to cirrhosis of the liver and liver failure. PSC increases the risk of various cancers including liver cancer, gallbladder carcinoma, colorectal cancer, and cholangiocarcinoma. The underlying cause of PSC is unknown. Genetic susceptibility, immune system dysfunction, and abnormal composition of the gut flora may play a role. This is further suggested by the observation that approximately 75% of individuals with PSC also have inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), most often ulcerative colitis. There is no effective medical treatment for primary sclerosing cholangitis. The most definitive treatment for PSC is a liver transplant but it can recur after transplantation. Many people affected by PSC require a liver transplant. PSC is a rare disease and most commonly affects people with IBD. Approximately 3‚Äì7.5% of people with ulcerative colitis have PSC and 80% of people with PSC have some form of IBD. Diagnosis usually occurs in younger people in their 30s or 40s. Individuals of Northern European ancestry are affected more often than people of Southern European or Asian descent. Men are affected more often than women. The disease was initially described in the mid-1800s but was not fully characterized until the 1970s with the advent of improved medical imaging techniques such as endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP). Signs and symptoms Nearly half of people with PSC do not have symptoms and are often incidentally discovered to have PSC due to abnormal liver function tests, but a substantial proportion will have debilitating signs and symptoms of the disease. Signs and symptoms of PSC may include severe itching and non- specific fatigue. Yellowing of the skin and white portion of the eyes may also be seen. Enlargement of the liver and spleen are seen in approximately 40% of affected individuals. Abdominal pain affects about 20% of people with PSC. Multiple episodes of life-threatening acute cholangitis (infection within the bile ducts) can be seen due to impaired drainage of the bile ducts, which increases the risk of infection. Epub 2015 Sep 21. * Dark urine due to excess conjugated bilirubin, which is water-soluble and excreted by the kidneys (i.e. choluria) * Malabsorption, especially of fat, and steatorrhea (fatty stool), due to an inadequate amount of bile reaching the small intestine, leading to decreased levels of the fat-soluble vitamins, A, D, E, and K. * Portal hypertension, a complication of cirrhosis, which can manifest with esophageal and parastomal varices as well as hepatic encephalopathy (mental status alteration/disturbance caused by liver dysfunction and shunting of blood away from the scarred liver; such that ammonia detoxification is reduced with concomitant encephalopathy). Cause The exact cause of primary sclerosing cholangitis is unknown and its pathogenesis is poorly understood. Although PSC is thought to be caused by autoimmune disease, it does not demonstrate a clear response to immunosuppressants. Thus, many experts believe it to be a complex, multifactorial (including immune-mediated) disorder and perhaps one that encompasses several different hepatobiliary diseases. Data have provided novel insights suggesting: # an important association between the intestinal microbiota and PSC and # a process referred to as cellular senescence and the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) in the pathogenesis of PSC. In addition, there are longstanding, well-recognized associations between PSC and human leukocyte antigen (HLA) alleles (A1, B8, and DR3). Pathophysiology PSC is characterized by inflammation of the bile ducts (cholangitis) with consequent stricturing (i.e., narrowing) and hardening (sclerosis) of these ducts due to scar formation, be it inside and/or outside the liver. The resulting scarring of the bile ducts obstructs the flow of bile, which further perpetuates bile duct and liver injury. Chronic impairment of bile flow due to blockage and dysfunctional bile transport (cholestasis) causes progressive biliary fibrosis and ultimately biliary cirrhosis and liver failure. The primary physiological function of bile is to assist in the breakdown and absorption of fat in the intestinal tract; a relative deficiency of bile can lead to fat malabsorption and deficiencies of fat-soluble vitamins (A, D, E, K). Liver enlargement is seen due to portal hypertension caused by compression of portal veins by the proximate sclerosed intrahepatic bile ducts, and leads to right upper quadrant abdominal pain. Diagnosis CT scan findings in a case of primary sclerosing cholangitis. Ultrasound of sclerosing cholangitis in the common bile duct PSC is generally diagnosed on the basis of having at least two of three clinical criteria after secondary causes of sclerosing cholangitis have been ruled out: * serum alkaline phosphatase (ALP) > 1.5x the upper limit of normal for longer than 6 months; * cholangiography demonstrating biliary strictures or irregularity consistent with PSC; and, * liver biopsy consistent with PSC (if available). Historically, a cholangiogram would be obtained via endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP), which typically reveals \\"beading\\" (alternating strictures and dilation) of the bile ducts inside and/or outside the liver. Currently, the preferred option for diagnostic cholangiography, given its non-invasive yet highly accurate nature, is magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP), a magnetic resonance imaging technique. MRCP has unique strengths, including high spatial resolution, and can even be used to visualize the biliary tract of small animal models of PSC. Most people with PSC have evidence of autoantibodies and abnormal immunoglobulin levels. For example, approximately 80% of people with PSC have perinuclear anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (P-ANCA); however, this and other immunoglobulin findings are not specific to those with PSC and are of unclear clinical significance/consequence. Antinuclear antibodies and anti-smooth muscle antibody are found in 20%-50% of PSC patients and, likewise, are not specific for the disease but may identify a subgroup of PSC patients who also have autoimmune hepatitis (i.e. PSC-AIH overlap syndrome). Other markers which may be measured and monitored are a complete blood count, serum liver enzymes, bilirubin levels (usually grossly elevated), kidney function, and electrolytes. Fecal fat measurement is occasionally ordered when symptoms of malabsorption (e.g., gross steatorrhea) are prominent. The differential diagnosis can include primary biliary cholangitis (formerly referred to as primary biliary cirrhosis), drug-induced cholestasis, cholangiocarcinoma, IgG4-related disease, post-liver transplantation non- anastomotic biliary strictures, and HIV-associated cholangiopathy. Primary sclerosing cholangitis and primary biliary cholangitis are distinct entities and exhibit important differences, including the site of tissue damage within the liver, associations with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), which includes ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease, response to treatment, and risks of disease progression. =Classification= Primary sclerosing cholangitis is typically classified into three subgroups based on whether the small and/or large bile ducts are affected. The subgroups of PSC include the following: * Classic PSC * Small-duct PSC * PSC associated with autoimmune hepatitis Management No pharmacologic treatment has been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for PSC. Some experts recommend a trial of ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA), a bile acid occurring naturally in small quantities in humans, as it has been shown to lower elevated liver enzyme numbers in patients with PSC and has proven effective in other cholestatic liver diseases. However, UDCA has yet to be shown to clearly lead to improved liver histology and survival. Guidelines from the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases and the American College of Gastroenterology do not support the use of UDCA but guidelines from the European Association for the Study of the Liver do endorse the use of moderate doses (13-15 milligrams per kilogram) of UDCA for PSC. Supportive treatment for PSC symptoms is the cornerstone of management. These therapies are aimed at relieving symptoms such as itching with antipruritics (e.g. bile acid sequestrants such as cholestyramine); antibiotics to treat episodes of ascending cholangitis; and vitamin supplements, as people with PSC are often deficient in fat-soluble vitamins (vitamin A, vitamin D, vitamin E, and vitamin K). ERCP and specialized techniques may also be needed to help distinguish between a benign PSC stricture and a bile duct cancer (cholangiocarcinoma). Liver transplantation is the only proven long-term treatment of PSC. Indications for transplantation include recurrent bacterial ascending cholangitis, decompensated cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma, hilar cholangiocarcinoma, and complications of portal hypertension. Not all patients are candidates for liver transplantation, and some will experience disease recurrence afterward. Prognosis Estimated median survival from diagnosis until liver transplant or PSC-related death is 21.3 years. Various models have been developed to help predict survival, but their use is generally best suited for research and not clinical purposes. A serum alkaline phosphatase less than 1.5 times the upper limit of normal has been associated with better outcomes but its utility in predicting long-term outcomes is unclear. =Related diseases= The development of any of the cancers associated with PSC predicts a poor prognosis. Complications from PSC-associated cancers account for 40% of deaths from PSC. Primary sclerosing cholangitis is one of the major known risk factors for cholangiocarcinoma, a cancer of the biliary tree, for which the lifetime risk among patients with PSC is 10-15%. This represents a 400-fold greater risk of developing cholangiocarcinoma compared to the general population. Surveillance for cholangiocarcinoma in patients with PSC is encouraged, with some experts recommending annual surveillance with a specialized imaging study and serum markers,Tabibian JH, Lindor KD. Challenges of Cholangiocarcinoma Detection in Patients with Primary Sclerosing Cholangitis. J Analytical Oncology. 2012;1(1):50-55. although consensus regarding the modality and interval has yet to be established. Similarly, a screening colonoscopy is recommended in people who receive a new diagnosis of primary sclerosing cholangitis since their risk of colorectal cancer is 10 times higher than that of the general population. PSC is strongly associated with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), in particular ulcerative colitis (UC) and to a lesser extent Crohn's disease. As many as 5% of patients with IBD are co-diagnosed with PSC and approximately 70% of people with PSC have IBD. Of note, the presence of colitis appears to be associated with a greater risk of liver disease progression and bile duct cancer (cholangiocarcinoma) development, although this relationship remains poorly understood. Close monitoring of PSC patients is vital. Various forms of gallbladder disease such as gallstones and gallbladder polyps are also common in those with PSC. Approximately 25% of people with PSC have gallstones. Ultrasound surveillance of the gallbladder every year is recommended for people with PSC. Any person with PSC who is found to have a mass in the gallbladder should undergo surgical removal of the gallbladder due to the high risk of cholangiocarcinoma. Osteoporosis (hepatic osteodystrophy) and hypothyroidism are also associated with PSC. Epidemiology There is a 2-3:1 male-to-female predilection in primary sclerosing cholangitis. PSC can affect men and women at any age, although it is commonly diagnosed in the fourth decade of life, most often in the presence of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). PSC progresses slowly and is often asymptomatic, so it can be present for years before it is diagnosed and before it causes clinically significant consequences. There is relatively little data on the prevalence and incidence of primary sclerosing cholangitis, with studies in different countries showing annual incidence of 0.068‚Äì1.3 per 100,000 people and prevalence 0.22‚Äì8.5 per 100,000; given that PSC is closely linked with ulcerative colitis, it is likely that the risk is higher in populations where UC is more common. In the United States, an estimated 29,000 individuals have PSC. Research directions Although there is no curative treatment, several clinical trials are underway that aim to slow progression of this liver disease. Obeticholic acid is being investigated as a possible treatment for PSC due to its antifibrotic effects. Simtuzumab is a monoclonal antibody against the pro-fibrotic enzyme LOXL2 that is being developed as a possible therapy for PSC.

An example of this would be the formation of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) by the movement of hydrogen ions (H+) across a membrane during cellular respiration or photosynthesis. An ion gradient has potential energy and can be used to power chemical reactions when the ions pass through a channel (red). Hydrogen ions, or protons, will diffuse from an area of high proton concentration to an area of lower proton concentration, and an electrochemical concentration gradient of protons across a membrane can be harnessed to make ATP. This process is related to osmosis, the diffusion of water across a membrane, which is why it is called \\"chemiosmosis\\". ATP synthase is the enzyme that makes ATP by chemiosmosis. It allows protons to pass through the membrane and uses the free energy difference to phosphorylate adenosine diphosphate (ADP), making ATP. The generation of ATP by chemiosmosis occurs in mitochondria and chloroplasts, as well as in most bacteria and archaea, an electron transport chain pumps H+ ions in the thylakoid spaces through thylakoid membranes to stroma (fluid). The energy from the electron movement through electron transport chains cross through ATP synthase which allows the proton to pass through them and use this free energy difference to photophosphorylate ADP making ATP. The chemiosmotic theory Peter D. Mitchell proposed the chemiosmotic hypothesis in 1961 . The theory suggests essentially that most adenosine triphosphate (ATP) synthesis in respiring cells comes from the electrochemical gradient across the inner membranes of mitochondria by using the energy of NADH and FADH2 formed from the breaking down of energy-rich molecules such as glucose. Chemiosmosis in a mitochondrion. Molecules such as glucose are metabolized to produce acetyl CoA as an energy-rich intermediate. The oxidation of acetyl coenzyme A (acetyl-CoA) in the mitochondrial matrix is coupled to the reduction of a carrier molecule such as nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) and flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD). The carriers pass electrons to the electron transport chain (ETC) in the inner mitochondrial membrane, which in turn pass them to other proteins in the ETC. The energy available in the electrons is used to pump protons from the matrix across the stroma, storing energy in the form of a transmembrane electrochemical gradient. The protons move back across the inner membrane through the enzyme ATP synthase. The flow of protons back into the matrix of the mitochondrion via ATP synthase provides enough energy for ADP to combine with inorganic phosphate to form ATP. The electrons and protons at the last pump in the ETC are taken up by oxygen to form water. This was a radical proposal at the time, and was not well accepted. The prevailing view was that the energy of electron transfer was stored as a stable high potential intermediate, a chemically more conservative concept. The problem with the older paradigm is that no high energy intermediate was ever found, and the evidence for proton pumping by the complexes of the electron transfer chain grew too great to be ignored. Eventually the weight of evidence began to favor the chemiosmotic hypothesis, and in 1978 Peter Mitchell was awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry.The Nobel Prize in Chemistry 1978. Chemiosmotic coupling is important for ATP production in mitochondria, chloroplasts and many bacteria and archaea. Proton-motive force Energy conversion by the inner mitochondrial membrane and chemiosmotic coupling between the chemical energy of redox reactions in the respiratory chain and the oxidative phosphorylation catalysed by the ATP synthase (sometimes called as \\"mitochondrial mushrooms\\"). The movement of ions across the membrane depends on a combination of two factors: # Diffusion force caused by a concentration gradient - all particles tend to diffuse from higher concentration to lower. # Electrostatic force caused by electrical potential gradient - cations like protons H+ tend to diffuse down the electrical potential, from the positive (P) side of the membrane to the negative (N) side. Anions diffuse spontaneously in the opposite direction. These two gradients taken together can be expressed as an electrochemical gradient. Lipid bilayers of biological membranes, however, are barriers for ions. This is why energy can be stored as a combination of these two gradients across the membrane. Only special membrane proteins like ion channels can sometimes allow ions to move across the membrane (see also: Membrane transport). In chemiosmotic theory transmembrane ATP synthases are very important. They convert energy of spontaneous flow of protons through them into chemical energy of ATP bonds. Hence researchers created the term proton-motive force (PMF), derived from the electrochemical gradient mentioned earlier. It can be described as the measure of the potential energy stored as a combination of proton and voltage (electrical potential) gradients across a membrane. The electrical gradient is a consequence of the charge separation across the membrane (when the protons H+ move without a counterion, such as chloride Cl‚àí). In most cases the proton-motive force is generated by an electron transport chain which acts as a proton pump, using the Gibbs free energy of redox reactions to pump protons (hydrogen ions) out across the membrane, separating the charge across the membrane. In mitochondria, energy released by the electron transport chain is used to move protons from the mitochondrial matrix (N side) to the intermembrane space (P side). Moving the protons out of the mitochondrion creates a lower concentration of positively charged protons inside it, resulting in excess negative charge on the inside of the membrane. The electrical potential gradient is about -170 mV , negative inside (N). These gradients - charge difference and the proton concentration difference both create a combined electrochemical gradient across the membrane, often expressed as the proton-motive force (PMF). In mitochondria, the PMF is almost entirely made up of the electrical component but in chloroplasts the PMF is made up mostly of the pH gradient because the charge of protons H+ is neutralized by the movement of Cl‚àí and other anions. In either case, the PMF needs to be greater than about 460 mV (45 kJ/mol) for the ATP synthase to be able to make ATP. =Equations= The proton-motive force is derived from the Gibbs free energy. Let N denote the inside of a cell, and let P denote the outside. Then :\\\\Delta\\\\\\\\!G = zF \\\\Delta\\\\\\\\!\\\\psi + RT \\\\ln\\\\frac{[\\\\mathrm{X}^{z+}]_{\\\\text{N}} }{[\\\\mathrm{X}^{z+}]_{\\\\text{P}}} where * \\\\Delta\\\\\\\\!G is the Gibbs free energy change per unit amount of cations transferred from P to N; * z is the charge number of the cation \\\\mathrm{X}^{z+}; * \\\\Delta\\\\psi is the electric potential of N relative to P; * [\\\\mathrm{X}^{z+}]_{\\\\text{P}} and [\\\\mathrm{X}^{z+}]_{\\\\text{N}} are the cation concentrations at P and N, respectively; * F is the Faraday constant; * R is the gas constant; and * T is the temperature. The molar Gibbs free energy change \\\\Delta\\\\\\\\!G is frequently interpreted as a molar electrochemical ion potential \\\\Delta\\\\\\\\!\\\\mu _{\\\\mathrm{X}^{z+}} = \\\\Delta\\\\\\\\!G. For an electrochemical proton gradient z=1 and as a consequence: :\\\\Delta\\\\\\\\!\\\\mu _{\\\\mathrm{H}^{+}} = F \\\\Delta\\\\\\\\!\\\\psi + RT \\\\ln \\\\frac{[\\\\mathrm{H}^+]_{\\\\text{N}} }{[\\\\mathrm{H}^+]_{\\\\text{P}}} = F \\\\Delta\\\\\\\\!\\\\psi - (\\\\ln 10)RT \\\\Delta \\\\mathrm{pH} A diagram of chemiosmotic phosphorylation where :\\\\Delta\\\\\\\\!\\\\mathrm{pH} = \\\\mathrm{pH}_{\\\\mathrm{N}} - \\\\mathrm{pH}_{\\\\mathrm{P}}. Mitchell defined the proton-motive force (PMF) as :\\\\Delta\\\\\\\\!p = -\\\\frac{\\\\Delta\\\\\\\\!\\\\mu_{\\\\mathrm{H^{+}}}}{F}. For example, \\\\Delta\\\\\\\\!\\\\mu_{\\\\mathrm{H}^+}=1\\\\,\\\\mathrm{kJ}\\\\,\\\\mathrm{mol}^{-1} implies \\\\Delta\\\\\\\\!p = 10.4\\\\,\\\\mathrm{mV}. At 298\\\\,\\\\mathrm{K} this equation takes the form: \\\\Delta\\\\\\\\!p = -\\\\Delta\\\\\\\\!\\\\psi + \\\\left(59.1\\\\,\\\\mathrm{mV}\\\\right)\\\\Delta\\\\\\\\!\\\\mathrm{pH}. Note that for spontaneous proton import from the P side (relatively more positive and acidic) to the N side (relatively more negative and alkaline), \\\\Delta\\\\\\\\!\\\\mu _{\\\\mathrm{H}^+} is negative (similar to \\\\Delta\\\\\\\\!G) whereas PMF is positive (similar to redox cell potential \\\\Delta E). It is worth noting that, as with any transmembrane transport process, the PMF is directional. The sign of the transmembrane electric potential difference \\\\Delta\\\\\\\\!\\\\psi is chosen to represent the change in potential energy per unit charge flowing into the cell as above. Furthermore, due to redox-driven proton pumping by coupling sites, the proton gradient is always inside-alkaline. For both of these reasons, protons flow in spontaneously, from the P side to the N side; the available free energy is used to synthesize ATP (see below). For this reason, PMF is defined for proton import, which is spontaneous. PMF for proton export, i.e., proton pumping as catalyzed by the coupling sites, is simply the negative of PMF(import). The spontaneity of proton import (from the P to the N side) is universal in all bioenergetic membranes. This fact was not recognized before the 1990s, because the chloroplast thylakoid lumen was interpreted as an interior phase, but in fact it is topologically equivalent to the exterior of the chloroplast. Azzone et al. stressed that the inside phase (N side of the membrane) is the bacterial cytoplasm, mitochondrial matrix, or chloroplast stroma; the outside (P) side is the bacterial periplasmic space, mitochondrial intermembrane space, or chloroplast lumen. Furthermore, 3D tomography of the mitochondrial inner membrane shows its extensive invaginations to be stacked, similar to thylakoid disks; hence the mitochondrial intermembrane space is topologically quite similar to the chloroplast lumen.: The energy expressed here as Gibbs free energy, electrochemical proton gradient, or proton-motive force (PMF), is a combination of two gradients across the membrane: * the concentration gradient (via \\\\Delta\\\\\\\\!\\\\mathrm{pH}) and * electric potential gradient \\\\Delta\\\\\\\\!\\\\psi. When a system reaches equilibrium, \\\\Delta\\\\\\\\!\\\\rho = 0; nevertheless, the concentrations on either side of the membrane need not be equal. Spontaneous movement across the potential membrane is determined by both concentration and electric potential gradients. The molar Gibbs free energy \\\\Delta\\\\\\\\!G_{\\\\mathrm{p}} of ATP synthesis :\\\\mathrm{ADP}^{4-} + \\\\mathrm{H}^{+} + \\\\mathrm{HOPO}_3^{2-} \\\\rightarrow \\\\mathrm{ATP}^{4-} + \\\\mathrm{H_2 O} is also called phosphorylation potential. The equilibrium concentration ratio [\\\\mathrm{H}^+]/[\\\\mathrm{ATP}] can be calculated by comparing \\\\Delta\\\\\\\\!p and \\\\Delta\\\\\\\\!G_{\\\\mathrm{p}}, for example in case of the mammalian mitochondrion: H+ / ATP = ŒîGp / (Œîp / 10.4 kJ*mol‚àí1/mV) = 40.2 kJ*mol‚àí1 / (173.5 mV / 10.4 kJ*mol‚àí1/mV) = 40.2 / 16.7 = 2.4. The actual ratio of the proton-binding c-subunit to the ATP-synthesizing beta-subunit copy numbers is 8/3 = 2.67, showing that under these conditions, the mitochondrion functions at 90% (2.4/2.67) efficiency. In fact, the thermodynamic efficiency is mostly lower in eukaryotic cells because ATP must be exported from the matrix to the cytoplasm, and ADP and phosphate must be imported from the cytoplasm. This \\"costs\\" one \\"extra\\" proton import per ATP, hence the actual efficiency is only 65% (= 2.4/3.67). In mitochondria Directions of chemiosmotic proton transfer in the mitochondrion, chloroplast and in gram- negative bacterial cells (cellular respiration and photosynthesis). The bacterial cell wall is omitted, gram-positive bacterial cells do not have outer membrane. The complete breakdown of glucose in the presence of oxygen is called cellular respiration. The last steps of this process occur in mitochondria. The reduced molecules NADH and FADH2 are generated by the Krebs cycle, glycolysis, and pyruvate processing. These molecules pass electrons to an electron transport chain, which uses the energy released to create a proton gradient across the inner mitochondrial membrane. ATP synthase then uses the energy stored in this gradient to make ATP. This process is called oxidative phosphorylation because it uses energy released by the oxidation of NADH and FADH2 to phospolyrize ADP into ATP. In plants The light reactions of photosynthesis generate ATP by the action of chemiosmosis. The photons in sunlight are received by the antenna complex of Photosystem II, which excites electrons to a higher energy level. These electrons travel down an electron transport chain, causing protons to be actively pumped across the thylakoid membrane into the thylakoid lumen. These protons then flow down their electrochemical potential gradient through an enzyme called ATP-synthase, creating ATP by the phosphorylation of ADP to ATP. The electrons from the initial light reaction reach Photosystem I, then are raised to a higher energy level by light energy and then received by an electron acceptor and reduce NADP+ to NADPH. The electrons lost from Photosystem II get replaced by the oxidation of water, which is \\"split\\" into protons and oxygen by the oxygen- evolving complex (OEC, also known as WOC, or the water-oxidizing complex). To generate one molecule of diatomic oxygen, 10 photons must be absorbed by photosystems I and II, four electrons must move through the two photosystems, and 2 NADPH are generated (later used for carbon dioxide fixation in the Calvin Cycle). In prokaryotes Chemiosmotic coupling between the energy of sunlight, bacteriorhodopsin and phosphorylation (chemical energy) during photosynthesis in halophilic bacteria Halobacterium salinarum (syn. H. halobium). The bacterial cell wall is omitted. Bacteria and archaea also can use chemiosmosis to generate ATP. Cyanobacteria, green sulfur bacteria, and purple bacteria synthesize ATP by a process called photophosphorylation. These bacteria use the energy of light to create a proton gradient using a photosynthetic electron transport chain. Non-photosynthetic bacteria such as E. coli also contain ATP synthase. In fact, mitochondria and chloroplasts are the product of endosymbiosis and trace back to incorporated prokaryotes. This process is described in the endosymbiotic theory. The origin of the mitochondrion triggered the origin of eukaryotes, and the origin of the plastid the origin of the Archaeplastida, one of the major eukaryotic supergroups. Chemiosmotic phosphorylation is the third pathway that produces ATP from inorganic phosphate and an ADP molecule. This process is part of oxidative phosphorylation.

He served as Prime Minister of the Soviet Union through the offices of chairman of the Inter-republican Economic Committee and chairman of the Committee on the Operational Management of the Soviet economy from 24 August to 26 December 1991. Responsible for overseeing the economy of the Soviet Union during the late Gorbachev Era, he was the last head of government of the Soviet Union, succeeding Valentin Pavlov. His appointment by the Russian SFSR was in violation of the constitutional protocol, which required the prime minister to be appointed by the President. After graduating in the 1950s, Silayev began his political career in the Ministry of Aviation Industry in the 1970s. During the Brezhnev Era he became Minister of Aviation Industry, a Central Committee member, and Minister of Machine-Tool and Tool Building Industry. When Nikolai Tikhonov's Second Government was dissolved, Mikhail Gorbachev appointed him deputy chairman of the Council of Ministers in Nikolai Ryzhkov's First Government. He left all posts in the central government in 1990 to focus in his post as chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Russian SFSR. He faced several cabinet difficulties during his tenure, and supported the majority of Boris Yeltsin's policies. Having opposed Yeltsin's secessionist policies during his tenure as Soviet Premier, he was removed from his post as Russian SFSR Premier and succeeded in his post by acting Premier Oleg Lobov. When he became Premier of the Soviet Union on 28 August 1991, Silayev opposed some of Yeltsin's policies which led to the disintegration of the Soviet Union. After Silayev resigned as Soviet Premier, he continued to work for the Yeltsin administration as the Permanent Representative of Russia to the European Community until his resignation in 1994. During the 2007 legislative election Silayev ran as a candidate for the Agrarian Party of Russia. Early life and career Silayev was born on 21 October 1930 in Baktyzino, Nizhny Novgorod Oblast, Russian SFSR, Soviet Union, and graduated from the Kazan Aviation Institute in 1954 as a mechanical engineer. In 1959 Silayev became a member of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (CPSU). During his tenure at the Gorky Aviation Plant (Gorky is now Nizhny Novgorod), where he started in 1954, he advanced from the lowest level to become the plant's foreman from 1971 to 1974. Silayev then served as Deputy Minister of Aviation Industry, and was later appointed Minister of Aviation Industry in 1981 in Nikolai Tikhonov's first government. He served briefly as Minister of Machine-Tool and Tool Building Industry of the Soviet Union from 1980 to 1981. At the 26th Congress Silayev was elected to the Central Committee (CPSU). In 1985, during Mikhail Gorbachev's rule, Silayev was appointed deputy chairman of the Council of Ministers and chairman of the Machine-Building Bureau of the Council of Ministers in Nikolai Ryzhkov's first and second government. He served in these posts until he was appointed Premier of the Russian SFSR in 1990. Russian premiership =Appointment= The election of a Chairman of the Council of Ministers ‚Äì Government of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic (RSFSR), literally Premier of the Russian SFSR, was not considered a very important event; the Premier was elected following the election of the chairman of the Supreme Soviet of the Russian SFSR, the Supreme Soviet's deputy chairman, and after a debate on Russian agriculture. Boris Yeltsin, the chairman of the Russian SFSR Supreme Soviet, was ordered to select candidates for the post of Premier to the Supreme Soviet. Mikhail Bocharov, a successful businessman and leader of the cooperative movement, rector of the Moscow Aviation Institute Yuri Ryzhkov, and Silayev were chosen as the candidates. Ryzhkov withdrew his candidacy before the first round of voting was finished. During the election Bocharov revealed his radical economic reform plan to the Supreme Soviet deputies; in it industry would be privatised, and subsidies to unprofitable enterprises would cease in a 100 Days reform package. Silayev did not have any similar economic reform plans, but was widely considered to be Yeltsin's favourite for the post. In the first round of voting Silayev earned 119 votes, while Bocharov earned 86 votes. To be elected to the post, a candidate needed to win over half of the vote; neither Silayev or Bocharov succeeded in this. Seeing that Silayev was Yeltsin's favourite, and had won more votes than Bocharov, Silayev ran unchallenged in the second election round, and was thus elected by a large margin. Gorbachev tried to break the Silayev‚ÄìYeltsin alliance but to no avail. In 1989, Valentin Pavlov, the Prime Minister of the Soviet Union from 14 January to 28 August 1991, had gathered together enough information on the errors and omissions of Silayev to weaken his position as Deputy Premier. Silayev never forgave Pavlov and relations between the two grew colder when Pavlov became the Prime Minister. =Silayev's government= Silayev repeatedly opined that if he ever was given conflicting instructions by the Premier of the Soviet Union and Yeltsin, he would always \\"observe the laws of the RSFSR\\", meaning he would obey Yeltsin. During his tenure as Premier, Silayev was never the de facto leader of the government cabinet, and was loyal to Yeltsin and the Supreme Soviet. In contrast to his predecessor, Aleksandr Vlasov, Silayev tried to modernise the Russian Government. Silayev decided to break with the old Soviet nomenklatura system of electing cabinet members by electing members using an \\"objective\\" and \\"scientific\\" basis. To accomplish this, Silayev asked professional psychologists to interview candidate cabinet members. Only 14 of the 200 cabinet candidates were recommended for a post in the government cabinet; even so, several of the candidates were given a post in the new government. All candidate members were selected by either Silayev, Yeltsin, or the Supreme Soviet. Silayev's government lacked ideological unity, and several conservative members were elected to the cabinet in July 1990, among them Oleg Lobov and Gennadii Kulik. In November 1990 Grigory Yavlinsky resigned from his cabinet post, citing the failure of the 500 Days Programme. However, some commentators believe Yavlinsky resigned because of frequent conflict between him and other cabinet members. RSFSR Minister of Finance Boris Fyodorov resigned on 5 December 1990, and accused the First Deputy Premiers of taking important financial decisions on behalf of the ministry and him as minister behind his back. Lobov, the First Deputy Premier in charge of regional development, had become a de facto leader of the cabinet. Lobov was Yeltsin's favourite, and tried to weaken Silayev's position within the cabinet. With the consent of the Supreme Soviet Silayev established a 16-member Presidium for the cabinet. Another problem facing Silayev was that the Supreme Soviet was usurping the power of the executive branch by strengthening the legislative branch. To accomplish this the Supreme Soviet established duplicated entities, such as the Committee for Mass Media, which duplicated the functions of the Ministry of Mass Media. Viktor Kisin, the Minister of Industry, told the press that the only employee of his ministry was in fact himself. In July 1990 Silayev agreed to create parallel executive-legislative administrative bodies. In December 1990 the Congress of People's Deputies of the Russian SFSR entrusted Silayev and his government to create a new plan for economic reform. The plan was finished in April 1991, and was referred to as the \\"Yeltsin‚ÄìSilayev Plan\\". The plan was heavily influenced by the 500 Days Programme, and supported privatisation and the marketisation of the economy. The reform plan was criticised by an official from the State Committee on Economic Reform of the central government; he called the plan \\"a statement of intents\\"; instead of an economic reform, he called it a \\"manifesto\\". A Supreme Soviet deputy noted the proposed reform lacked real statistical insight. Even so, the proposed reform received a majority in a Supreme Soviet vote; Yeltsin's supporters knew that his economic reform proposal had to be accepted before the July presidential election. Following the July presidential election the Russian government resigned, and the post of premier was once again up for election. Silayev had strong competitors for the post, such as Yurii Skokov, but won the election. Soviet premiership The State Committee for the State of Emergency failed to arrest Silayev or any other high-standing Russian state officials during the August Coup. Silayev was one of several leading Russian SFSR politicians who flew to Gorbachev's summer house in the immediate aftermath of the failed coup. On 24 August the Russian SFSR Council of Ministers issued a decree transferring central government authority over economic and communications ministries to the RSFSR Government, and took control of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and KGB archives. With the central government's authority greatly weakened, Gorbachev established a four- man committee, led by Silayev, that included Grigory Yavlinsky, Arkady Volsky, and Yuri Luzhkov, to elect a new Cabinet of Ministers.–£–∫–∞–∑ –ü—Ä–µ–∑–∏–¥–µ–Ω—Ç–∞ –°–°–°–† –æ—Ç 24.08.1991 N –£–ü-2461 \\"–û –ö–∞–±–∏–Ω–µ—Ç–µ –ú–∏–Ω–∏—Å—Ç—Ä–æ–≤ –°–°–°–†\\" This committee was later transformed into the Committee on the Operational Management of the Soviet economy (COMSE), also chaired by Silayev, to manage the Soviet economy.

COMSE was quickly surpassed in authority by the Inter-republican Economic Committee (IEC). Its function was to coordinate economic policy across the Soviet Union.

When he first took office, Silayev wanted to reduce the powers of the central government and give more powers to the Soviet Republics. This view changed; he demanded that Yeltsin give back much of the authority of the central government which he had usurped following the August Coup. In this he failed, and his position as Russian SFSR Premier was severely weakened as a result. Oleg Lobov, Silayev's First Deputy Premier, led the anti-Silayev faction in the Russian SFSR Council of Ministers and managed to oust him on 26 September 1991; Lobov succeeded Silayev as acting Premier of the Russian SFSR. Silayev, as overseer of the economy, was given the task of initiating economic reforms in the Soviet Union in a way that suited both the central government and the Soviet republics. Silayev tried to maintain an integrated economy while initiating the marketisation of the economy. On 19 December COMSE was dissolved by a presidential Russian SFSR decree, and on 25 December 1991 Gorbachev announced his resignation from the post of President of the USSR in connection with the creation of the Commonwealth of Independent States. Post-Soviet Russia On 18 December 1991 Silayev became the Permanent Representative of Russia to the European Community in Brussels; he resigned from this post on 7 February 1994. In late 1994 Silayev became the President of the Machine-Building Association of the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS), which consisted of more than a hundred civilian and military enterprises and associations, mostly of Russian origin. He became a member of the Ecological Movement \\"Cedar\\" in 1995. Since 1998, he has been President of Industrial Machine, an industrial and financial group; he has simultaneously headed the National Committee, which promotes economic cooperation with Latin America.

Biography Pestalozzi was born in Z√ºrich. After his university education at University of St. Gallen, he started working for Migros. In the 1960s he also built up the Gottlieb Duttweiler Institut, a think tank named after the Migros founder (who had died in 1962). The institute was being established to investigate the range of possible shortcomings and negative effects of capitalism, in particular within Western consumer society, so that they could be combated more effectively. Pestalozzi fulfilled that task very thoroughly, especially in his lectures, so much so that in 1977 he was fired by Migros. Rather than looking for a new job, he became a freelance writer and self- proclaimed \\"autonomous agitator\\" who sided with the fledgling European youth, peace and ecological movements. He preached \\"positive subversion\\" and, in a Kantian manner, tried to convince people that using their own intelligence was the right thing to do.

The Office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response (ASPR) of the Department of Health and Human Services has managed the Strategic National Stockpile since October 1, 2018. Prior to that, the stockpile was managed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). As of 2020, the SNS contains around $7‚Äì8 billion worth of emergency supplies stored in secret warehouses located strategically around the country. By March 10, 2020, it was reported that the COVID-19 pandemic had already \\"placed significant strain on the stores of masks, medicine, and medical equipment\\" found in the stockpile. Prior to April 3, 2020 the role of the stockpile was to support state, local, tribal, and territorial responders providing potentially life-saving pharmaceuticals and medical supplies for use in a public health emergency severe enough to cause local supplies to run out. Its current role is to act as a national supplement of medicine and medical equipment to a State's supplies, acting as a \\"stopgap buffer\\" when \\"the immediate supply of adequate amounts of these materials may not be immediately available.\\" History During the first decade of the Cold War, the United States accumulated a civil defense medical stockpile at 32 storage facilities. The supplies began to degrade in the 1960s, and were disposed of and the stockpile program closed in 1974.Coronavirus: Strategic National Stockpile was ready, but not for this In April 1998, President Bill Clinton read the Richard Preston novel The Cobra Event, a fiction book about a mad scientist spreading a virus throughout New York City. As a result, Clinton held a meeting with scientists and cabinet officials to discuss the threat of bioterrorism. He was so impressed, that he asked the experts to meet with senior-level aides at the Department of Defense and in the Department of Health and Human Services. At that time, the government had stockpiles of medications for military personnel, but did not have them for civilians. Shortly after, The Washington Post wrote that Clinton surprised many in Washington at how fast he and his National Security Council had moved to change that. By October, Clinton signed into law a new budget of $51 million for pharmaceutical and vaccine stockpiling to be carried out by the CDC. The US Congress appropriated funds for the CDC to create a pharmaceutical and vaccine stockpile to handle biological and chemical threats from disease that could affect large numbers of the US civilian population, in Public Law 105‚Äì277 dated October 21, 1998. The original name was the National Pharmaceutical Stockpile (NPS) program, but since the original authorization additional materials have been added to the stockpile. On March 1, 2003, the NPS was renamed the Strategic National Stockpile (SNS) program with joint management by Department of Homeland Security and Department of Health and Human Services. In at least 10 government reports from 2003 to 2015, federal officials predicted the U.S. would experience a shortage of ventilators and other medical supplies if it faced a large-scale infectious disease outbreak.https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/27/cnn10/ventilators-supply-government- warnings-coronavirus-invs/index.html In 2005 and in preparation for a predictable pandemic influenza, the Bush administration called for the coordination of domestic production and stockpiling of protective personal equipments. In 2006, the US Congress funded the integration of protective equipment to a Strategic National Stockpile: 52 million surgical masks and 104 million N95 air-filtration masks were acquired and added. During the 2009 flu pandemic, tens of millions of masks were used, but during the Obama administration strategic stocks were not ‚Äúsignificantly restored‚Äù, neither have they been during the Trump administration.D'Angelo Gore Trump Falsely Claims He Inherited ‚ÄòEmpty‚Äô Stockpile April 3, 2020 FactCheck.org Video produced by HHS in October 2019 about the 20th anniversary of the stockpile. Location The actual supply of drugs and supplies that make up the SNS are located in twelve secret locations strategically placed throughout the US. The locations appear to look like ordinary commercial warehouses. Inside the warehouses, supplies are stacked on shelves that can measure five stories high. Armed personnel guard the warehouse contents and, according to NPR in 2020, during the COVID-19 global pandemic, \\"rows of ventilators, which can support people who are having trouble breathing, are kept charged up and ready to roll at a moment's notice.\\" Composition The SNS holds a variety of items that would be helpful to the general population in the event of a widespread disease outbreak. =12-hour push pack= Each push pack weighs about . Its contents include broad-spectrum oral and intravenous antibiotics, emergency medicines, IV fluids and kits, airway equipment, bandages, vaccines, antitoxins, and ventilators.https://ftp.cdc.gov/pub/MCMTraining/Miscellaneous%20Resources%20and%20Documents/SNS_Push%20Package%20Catalogl_2-1-12.pdf The material deploys by unmarked trucks and airplanes within 12 hours of the receipt of a request by the CDC. The U.S. Marshals Service provides armed security from these federal sites to local destinations. The SNS has adequate vaccines and countermeasures in its stockpile, including 300 million smallpox treatment courses and enough anthrax vaccine to handle a three-city incident. =CHEMPACK= CHEMPACKs contain nerve agent antidotes to help in the event of a nerve agent attack or industrial accident. As of 2015, 1,960 CHEMPACKs were forward-deployed in more than 1,340 locations across each state and territory of the United States. History of deployments Public Health Emergency lists large-scale deployments from the SNS in response to emergencies. The SNS successfully deployed 12-hour \\"push packages\\" to New York City and Washington, D.C., in response to the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001 and managed inventory (MI) to numerous locations in response to the anthrax terrorist attacks of 2001. Following the landfall of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita on the Gulf coast of Mississippi and Louisiana in September 2005, the CDC deployed SNS assets, technical assistance and response units, plus the newly developed and rapidly deployable \\"federal medical contingency stations\\" to state- approved locations near or in the disaster areas. The contingency stations, later renamed Federal Medical Stations (FMS), are caches of equipment and supplies provided by the SNS, set up in local \\"buildings of opportunity\\" and staffed by local or federal medical personnel to provide triage, low acuity care, and temporary holding of displaced patients for whom local acute care systems are damaged or destroyed. Since the original deployment following Hurricane Katrina, FMSs have been deployed to support other major disaster responses including Superstorm Sandy. The FMS program is a collaboration between CDC and the Office of Emergency Management under the HHS Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response. In 2014, responding to stakeholder feedback, a 50-bed FMS cache was developed and made available in addition to the original 250-bed FMS.HHS, ASPR FMS Concept of Operation, 2014 The SNS released one-quarter of its antiviral drug inventory (Tamiflu and Relenza), personal protective equipment (PPE), and respiratory protection devices, to help every US state respond to the H1N1 Influenza 2009 swine influenza outbreak in the United States. =2020 coronavirus pandemic= material being moved in March 2020 The SNS was involved in providing supplies to the repatriation efforts of State Department employees from China and Japan during the early stages of the COVID-19 epidemic, and shipped thousands of N95 masks to Washington, Massachusetts, and New York states in an effort to respond to COVID-19 \\"hot spots\\" as community spread began in the US. It stockpiles a stated 13 million masks, but has placed an order to be fulfilled by September 2021 for 500 million more. Furthermore, the SNS was criticized during the COVID-19 pandemic for containing millions of masks already past their expiration dates. As of March 2020, the national strategic stockpile had 40 million masks while 100 times more were expected to be necessary to handle the pandemic crisis. On March 29, 2020, HHS accepted a donation of 30 million doses of hydroxychloroquine sulfate from Sandoz and one million doses of Resochin (chloroquine phosphate) from Bayer Pharmaceuticals for use in treating hospitalized COVID-19 patients or in clinical trials. The SNS will work with the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to deliver the doses to states. On April 1, 2020, Department of Homeland Security officials told reporters that the cache of personal protective equipment stored by the SNS was almost depleted due to the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States. This was later confirmed by President Donald Trump. PPE from the SNS was sent directly to health facilities across the country. During the COVID-19 pandemic, states criticized the lack of availability of medical supplies from the federal stockpile. At a White House press conference on April 2, 2020, senior advisor Jared Kushner commented \\"The notion of the federal stockpile was it's supposed to be our stockpile. It's not supposed to be states' stockpiles that they then use.\\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQbNHOF8_jY?t=6530 The idea that the stockpile was not a backup for states that run out of supplies was disputed by Governor Laura Kelly of Kansas, among others. The description of the stockpile, as listed on its website, was changed the day after Kushner's remarks to better align with them, from: > \\"Strategic National Stockpile is the nation‚Äôs largest supply of life-saving > pharmaceuticals and medical supplies for use in a public health emergency > severe enough to cause local supplies to run out. When state, local, tribal, > and territorial responders request federal assistance to support their > response efforts, the stockpile ensures that the right medicines and > supplies get to those who need them most during an emergency. Organized for > scalable response to a variety of public health threats, this repository > contains enough supplies to respond to multiple large-scale emergencies > simultaneously.\\" to: > \\"The Strategic National Stockpile's role is to supplement state and local > supplies during public health emergencies. Many states have products > stockpiled, as well. The supplies, medicines, and devices for life-saving > care contained in the stockpile can be used as a short-term stopgap buffer > when the immediate supply of adequate amounts of these materials may not be > immediately available.\\" Washington state announced on April 5 that it would return more than 400 ventilators it had received from the Stockpile \\"...to help states facing higher numbers of COVID-19 cases.\\" On April 8, 2020, HHS contracted with DuPont for 2.25 million Tyvek suits to be delivered to the SNS to be used as PPE for frontline healthcare workers. By April 13, 2020, HHS used the Defense Production Act (DPA) to contract for ventilator production with General Electric, Hill-Rom, Medtronic, ResMed, and Vyaire. Additionally, they contracted with Hamilton and Zoll for ventilator production without using the DPA. The seven contracts are expected to produce 137,431 ventilators by the end of 2020 at a total cost of $1.435 billion. Related legislation Section 403 of the Pandemic and All-Hazards Preparedness Reauthorization Act of 2013 (H.R. 307; 113th Congress) reauthorized the Strategic National Stockpile for FY2014-FY2018. It required the Secretary of Health and Human Services to: # submit to the appropriate congressional committees, to the extent that the disclosure of such information does not compromise national security, the annual review of the contents of the Stockpile; and # review and revise the contents of the Stockpile to ensure that the potential depletion of countermeasures currently in the Stockpile is identified and appropriately addressed, including through necessary replenishment.

The officer saw the words, \\"This Bike Is a Pipe Bomb\\" and became concerned. The area was cordoned off, and part of the campus was closed for several hours. The bicycle was subsequently destroyed by the Athens bomb squad despite assurances from the bike's owner that it was just a sticker. The owner, a graduate student, was initially charged with inducing panic, a misdemeanor. However, the charges were dropped a few days later. Later the student was awarded money for the damages to his bicycle. A similar incident occurred in 2001, when a police officer spotted and detained a woman at an Austin, Texas peace rally. Her bicycle was also labeled with the band's sticker. The woman was released after the band's existence was confirmed. On March 14, 2006 Bellarmine Hall at Saint Joseph's University in Philadelphia, PA was evacuated because of another bicycle with the band's name painted on it. No charges were filed. On February 16, 2009, Terminal C at Memphis International Airport was evacuated because of a bicycle with the band's sticker on it. A pilot notified police when he saw the bike, with the band's sticker on it, parked outside of the terminal. Police evacuated the terminal and sent in K9 units; however, no explosive materials were found. Police arrested the owner of the bike but let the owner go a few hours later because he had not committed a crime. After hearing about the incident, the band's lead singer urged fans to use caution when they applied the stickers.

Buddha statues for new monastery, Kullu, H.P., India Large Gautama Buddha statue in Buddha Park of Ravangla, Sikkim Commonalities Despite cultural and regional differences in the interpretations of texts about the life of Gautama Buddha, there are some general guidelines to the attributes of a Buddharupa: *Fingers and toes are elongated proportionately *Long, aquiline nose *Elongated earlobes *Head protuberance *Broad shoulders The elongated earlobes are vestiges of his life as a prince, when he wore extravagant jewelry. The bump at the top of the head is the ushnisha and represents spirituality, wisdom, and awakening. Regional variations Depictions of the Buddha vary widely across cultures. =Proportions= The image of Buddhas started to emerge from the first century CE in North India, developed in Gandhara and Mathura. The art of Gandhara was influenced by Ancient Greek art, leading to the development of Greco-Buddhist art with anatomically well-proportioned and realistic figure of the Buddha. One of the most influential Buddhist art was Gupta art and the later Amaravati style. From India the depiction of Buddha spread to the rest of Asia. The Buddharupas of India, Sri Lanka, Javanese Sailendra and Cambodian art usually depict a well-proportioned figure, but sometimes he is shown emaciated, in recollection of the Buddha's years of ascetic practices. Japanese buddharupas are often very square and stolid while Indian and Southeast Asian ones often have thinner figures. Many people may be familiar with the \\"Happy\\" or \\"Laughing\\" Buddha, a different historical figure, who should not be confused with the images of Gautama Buddha. Budai, a Chinese Buddhist monk also known as Hotei, is depicted as fat and happy, almost always shown smiling or laughing, and is associated with Maitreya, the future Buddha. =Postures, gestures and artifacts= A statue or a painting of Buddha always illustrates a mudra or gesture. Among hundreds of mudras, the five transcendental Buddha‚Äôs also called ‚ÄúDhyani Buddhas‚Äù or ‚ÄúPancha Buddhas‚Äù bear the most important mudras.These mudras are as follows. * Dharmachakra Buddha Mudra ‚Äì Vairochana: Dharmachakra mudra has two hands held against the chest with the tips of the thumbs and forefingers of each hand united. This mudra represents a gesture of teaching. * Bhumisparsa Buddha Mudra ‚Äì Akshobhya: This gesture, ‚Äútouching the earth‚Äù (Bhumisparsa) mudra, became Buddha Akshobhya‚Äôs mudra. The Buddha called upon mother earth to bear witness to his attainment of Enlightenment. To indicate this, he touched the earth with his right hand as witness to his perfection. Thus, this mudra is formed. * Varada Buddha Mudra ‚Äì Ratna Sambhava: In this mudra right hand lies open near his right knee. His left hand is seen holding an alms bowl. In Sanskrit, Varada means ‚Äògranting a boon‚Äô. The gesture shows the right palm turned towards the receiver of boons, with the fingers pointed downwards. * Dhyana Buddha Mudra ‚Äì Amitabha Buddha: This mudra has palms joined together with the right on the left, two thumb fingers touching each other. As bowl is placed in between his two palms. Here the meditating hand gesture represents a state of deep meditation and the unity of wisdom and compassion. * Abhaya Buddha Mudra ‚Äì Amoghsiddhi : Abhaya mudra represents the hand gesture of fearlessness and protection. The gesture of fearlessness and protection, usually shown as the left hand with palm turned outward and all fingers extended upwards. The symbolic meaning of the dispelling fear pose is an interpretation of the action of preaching. It is said that one gains fearlessness by following the Bodhisattva path. Images of Buddha sometimes show him reclining, recalling the Buddha Shakyamuni's departure into final nirvana. Other times he is holding various symbolic objects, or making symbolic mudras (gestures). The clothing also varies; in China and Japan, where it is considered socially improper for monks and nuns to expose the upper arm, the Buddharupa has a tunic and long sleeves, much like the traditional monks and nuns, while in India they are often topless.

She was first elected as a Member of Parliament under the Reform Party of Canada ticket in the Alberta riding of Calgary Southeast in the 1993 federal election. , Accessed 14 April 2011 Before entering politics, Brown was a schoolteacher and then agribusiness executive. She is of Croatian descent. Brown rose to prominence as a well-spoken and moderate member of the Reform Party, becoming Canadian Heritage Critic in its shadow cabinet. She was one of only two MPs, the other being Stephen Harper, to speak out against the motion to deny same-sex couples the same rights as heterosexual ones at the 1994 Reform convention. She won much admiration for putting a yellow rose on the empty desk of rival party leader Lucien Bouchard, who was suffering from a life-threatening illness. The image of the solitary rose on his empty desk was broadcast around the nation. Brown was curious about gender roles within Canadian politics and subsequently wrote an article on the subject. \\"Changing the Gender Agenda of Politics,\\" Canadian Parliamentary Review, vol. 17(2): 8-10 (1994) Later that year she was voted sexiest, best-dressed, and most generous MP by the Hill Times newspaper. Due to her success in questioning Canadian Heritage Minister Michel Dupuy, she was promoted to critic for Human Resources Development Canada, one of the largest ministries in the federal government. In 1996, however, Brown, along with fellow Reform MP Jim Silye, spoke out openly against the right wing of the party. The remarks were motivated by Art Hanger's planned trip to Singapore to look into the success of caning at deterring crime. While the party leaders acknowledged that Brown and Silye's criticism had weight, they were attacked for publicly criticizing the party. Brown promised to deal with any future concerns within the party, and both she and Silye apologized. The next month, however, Reform MP Bob Ringma mentioned that store owners should be free to move gays and \\"ethnics\\" \\"to the back of the shop\\", or even to fire them, if it helped their business. A few days later MP David Chatters aroused more controversy when he suggested it would be reasonable to ban homosexuals from teaching children. Party leader Preston Manning and the other party notables did not censure the remarks or demand apologies from the MPs. On May 7, 1996, the Reform executive voted to suspend Ringma and Chatters for their remarks, but also voted to suspend Brown for speaking out against the party. Brown was disappointed and three days later announced she was quitting the party to sit as an independent. She was especially critical of Preston Manning and how he managed the party. Brown remained an independent for the rest of the parliament, but began to cooperate closely with the Progressive Conservative Party of Canada. In the 1997 election, she ran as a Progressive Conservative, moving to contest the adjacent riding of Calgary Southwest, then held by Reform leader Preston Manning. Despite drawing much attention in the sometimes bitter campaign against her former party leader, Brown lost by a significant margin, and retired permanently from politics. Since then she completed in 2005 a Ph.D. in education and women's studies. She became a lifelong learning consultant and retired in 2013.

She was a member of a group of five broadly similar battleships, along with , , , and , which were ordered in response to the British . Bouvet was the last vessel of the group to be built, and her design was based on that of Charles Martel. Like her half-sisters, she was armed with a main battery of two guns and two guns in individual turrets. She had a top speed of , which made her one of the fastest battleships in the world at the time. Bouvet proved to be the most successful design of the five, and she was used as the basis for the subsequent . Nevertheless, she suffered from design flaws that reduced her stability and contributed to her loss in 1915. Bouvet spent the majority of her peacetime career in the Mediterranean Squadron conducting routine training exercises. This period was relatively uneventful, though she was involved in a collision with the battleship in 1903 that saw both ships' captains relieved of command. In 1906, she assisted in the response to the eruption of Mount Vesuvius in Italy. Bouvet was withdrawn from front-line service in 1907 and thereafter used as part of the training fleet. The ship was the only vessel of her group of five half-sisters still in service at the outbreak of World War I in July 1914. A significant portion of the French Army was stationed in French North Africa, so at the start of the war, Bouvet and much of the rest of the fleet were used to escort troop convoys across to southern France. With this work done by late August, Bouvet and several other battleships were used to patrol for contraband shipments in the central Mediterranean. From November to late December, she was stationed as a guard ship at the northern entrance to the Suez Canal. The ship thereafter joined the naval operations off the Dardanelles, where she participated in a series of attacks on the Ottoman fortifications guarding the straits. These culminated in a major assault on 18 March 1915; during the attack, she was hit approximately eight times by shellfire but was not seriously damaged. While turning to withdraw, she struck a mine and sank within two minutes; only 75 men were rescued from a complement of 718. Two British battleships were also sunk by mines that day, and the disaster convinced the Allies to abandon the naval campaign in favor of an amphibious assault on the Gallipoli Peninsula. Design Illustration of , which formed the basis for Bouvets design In 1889, the British Royal Navy passed the Naval Defence Act that resulted in the construction of the eight s; this major expansion of naval power led the French government to pass its reply, the (Naval Law) of 1890. The law called for a total of twenty-four \\"\\" (squadron battleships) and a host of other vessels, including coastal defense battleships, cruisers, and torpedo boats. The first stage of the program was to be a group of four squadron battleships that were built to different designs but met the same basic characteristics, including armor, armament, and displacement. The naval high command issued the basic requirements on 24 December 1889; displacement would not exceed , the primary armament was to consist of and guns, the belt armor should be thick, and the ships should maintain a top speed of . The secondary battery was to be either or caliber, with as many guns fitted as space would allow. The general similarity of the ships led some observers to group them together as a ship class, though the authors of Conway's All the World's Fighting Ships point out that the vessels had \\"sufficient differences to prevent them from being considered as one class.\\" The basic design for the ships was based on the previous battleship , but instead of mounting the main battery all on the centerline, the ships used the lozenge arrangement of the earlier vessel , which moved two of the main battery guns to single turrets on the wings. Although the navy had stipulated that displacement could be up to 14,000 t, political considerations, namely parliamentary objections to increases in naval expenditures, led the designers to limit displacement to around . Five naval architects submitted proposals to the competition; Charles Ernest Huin prepared the design for Bouvet. He had also designed her half-sister , upon which the design for Bouvet was based. Before work on Charles Martel had begun, the naval command asked Huin to design an improved version. He completed the plans for the ship, which was slightly larger than her half-sisters, on 20 May, and the Navy awarded the contract for the ship on 8 October 1892. Bouvet proved to be the most successful of the five ships, and she was the only one still in active service at the outbreak of World War I. She also provided the basis for the next class of French battleships, the three s built in the mid-1890s. She and her half- sisters nevertheless were disappointments in service; Bouvet suffered from stability problems that ultimately contributed to her loss in 1915, and all five of the vessels compared poorly to their British counterparts, particularly their contemporaries of the . The ships suffered from a lack of uniformity of equipment, which made them hard to maintain in service, and their mixed gun batteries comprising several calibers made gunnery in combat conditions difficult, since shell splashes were hard to differentiate. Many of the problems that plagued the ships in service were a result of the limitation on their displacement, particularly their stability and seakeeping. =General characteristics and machinery= Bouvet early in her career Bouvet was long between perpendiculars, long at the waterline, and long overall. She had a beam of and an average draft of . She had a displacement of as designed. Unlike her half-sisters, which had a cut down quarterdeck, Bouvet retained a full flush deck. Her superstructure was reduced in size compared to her half- sisters, and she had a pair of short military masts; these changes were made to reduce the top-heaviness experienced with the earlier vessels. She kept the pronounced tumblehome to give the 27 cm guns wide fields of fire. Bouvet had a standard crew of 31 officers and 591 enlisted men, though as a flagship her crew grew to 41 officers and 651 enlisted men. She had three vertical triple- expansion steam engines each driving a single three-bladed screw; the outboard screws were wide, while the center shaft was slightly smaller, at in diameter. The engines were powered with steam supplied by thirty-two Belleville water- tube boilers that were license-built by Indret. The boilers were divided into four boiler rooms, which were placed in two pairs on either end of the magazines for the wing turrets, and divided by a central bulkhead. The boilers were ducted into a pair of funnels. Her three engines were placed side by side and also divided by longitudinal bulkheads. Her propulsion system was rated at , which allowed the ship to steam at a maximum speed of on speed trials with a light loading, though while on a 24-hour test using normal displacement, she cruised at . Using forced draft, she reached from during the tests. Bouvet was fast by the standards of the day; the only British battleship that approached her in speed was the second-class battleship . As built, Bouvet could carry of coal, though additional space allowed for up to in total. At a cruising speed of , the ship could steam for . The ship's electrical system consisted of four 400-ampere/80-volt dynamos that had a combined output of . The dynamos were placed on the platform deck between the ducting for the boilers. Several smaller electric motors, rated at , powered the ship's ventilation system, and motors drove the ash hoists for the boiler rooms. Bouvet was fitted with six searchlights: four on the battery deck (two amidships and one each forward and aft) and the remaining two on the masts. =Armament= Bouvet at anchor, June 1912 Bouvets main armament consisted of two Canon de 305 mm Mod√®le 1893 guns in two single-gun turrets, one each fore and aft and two Canon de 274 mm Mod√®le 1893 guns in two single-gun turrets, one amidships on each side, sponsoned out over the tumblehome of the ship's sides. Both types of guns were experimental 45 caliber variants of the guns fitted in her half-sister . The 305 mm guns had a muzzle velocity of , which allowed the shells to penetrate up to of iron armor at a range of . This was sufficiently powerful to allow Bouvets main guns to easily penetrate the armor of most contemporary battleships at the common battle ranges of the day. The 274 mm guns, which were also 45 calibers long, had the same muzzle velocity, but being significantly smaller than the 305 mm guns, produced of iron penetration. The gun turrets were hydraulically operated and required the guns to be depressed to ‚àí4¬∞ to be loaded. They both had a rate of fire of one shell per minute. Both types of mounts allowed elevation to 14¬∞; for the 305 mm guns, this produced a maximum range of , and for the 274 mm guns, their maximum range was . Her secondary armament consisted of eight Canon de 138 mm Mod√®le 1891 naval guns, which were mounted in single turrets in the hull; two were placed just aft of the forward 305 mm turret, four were placed on either sides of the 274 mm guns, and the remaining two were just aft of the rear 305 mm turret. These guns had a firing rate of 4 rounds per minute, with a maximum range of from up to 20¬∞ elevation. For defense against torpedo boats, Bouvet carried eight quick-firing (QF) guns in individual pedestal mounts with gun shields on the upper deck. Four were located between the funnels, two were placed abreast of the forward bridge, and the remaining two were similarly arranged on either side of the aft bridge. They had a rate of fire of between 7 and 15 shots per minute and they could engage targets out to . She also had twelve 3-pounder guns, and eight 1-pounder guns, all in individual mounts. Of the 37 mm guns, three were five-barreled Hotchkiss revolver cannon and the remaining five were single-barrel QF guns. Four of the 47 mm guns were mounted on the lower platforms of the military masts and the remainder, along with the 37 mm guns, were distributed along the length of the superstructure. As was customary for capital ships of the period, her armament suite was rounded out by four torpedo tubes, two of which were submerged in the ship's hull; both were located on the broadside close to the bow; they were aimed directly perpendicular to the centerline. The other two tubes were mounted above water, in trainable launchers placed amidships. The fire of these tubes was directed either by armored sights located abreast of the conning tower or unprotected sights on the battery deck. Bouvet carried a total of ten torpedoes of the Mod√®le 1892 Toulon/Fiume type; six were allocated to the submerged tubes, with the other four for the deck launchers. Bouvet also carried twenty Mod√®le 1892 naval mines that could be laid by the ship's pinnaces. Fire control In the early 1890s, before Bouvet had begun construction, the French Navy introduced a fire-control system that included rangefinders, observers in the masts, and electric order transmitters to communicate fire control instructions from the control center to the gun crews. Bouvet was the first battleship completed with the system; for the purposes of fire control, her gun battery was divided into either individual sections (the large and medium- caliber guns) or groups of two or more guns (the 100 mm, 47 mm, and 37 mm guns). All of the guns were controlled by the Poste central de commande (central command post) that was located directly below the conning tower, below the armored deck. The central command post received the range and bearing information from the rangefinders and calculated firing solutions, which would then be sent via the electric order transmitters to direct the fire of individual guns or sections. =Armor= The ship's armor was constructed with nickel steel manufactured by several firms, including Schneider-Creusot, Saint-Chamond, and Ch√¢tillon & Commentry, which allowed the design staff to reduce the thickness of the steel without compromising its effectiveness. Thus, weight could be saved that could be used elsewhere in the displacement-limited ships. The main belt was thick amidships, and tapered down to at the lower edge. Forward of the central citadel, the belt was reduced to (also reduced to 200 mm on the lower edge) and aft of the citadel, it tapered to (reduced to on the bottom edge). The belt extended for the entire length of the hull, and it was backed with 200 mm of teak. Above the belt was thick strake of side armor that created a highly subdivided cofferdam to reduce the risk of flooding from battle damage. The side of the cofferdam was reinforced by two layers of plating. Bouvets main deck was protected with of mild steel, back with two layers of 10 mm plating. Mild steel was used here, as the deck was designed to bend rather than shatter when struck by an armor-piercing shell at an oblique angle. The lower platform deck was thick, with a single layer of 10 mm plating behind it; it was intended to catch splinters that penetrated the main deck. The main battery guns (both the 305 mm and 274 mm guns) were protected with of cemented armor on the faces and sides, with thick roofs and thick floors. Both the floors and roofs were composed of mild steel. The turrets sat atop barbettes with thick sides. The 138 mm turrets had thick sides and faces, with roofs and floors. Gun shields that were thick protected the 100 mm guns. The conning tower had thick sides, a 20 mm thick roof, and a thick floor. The uptakes for the boilers were protected with coamings that were 300 mm thick. The ship's armor layout was not as effective as the designers had hoped; at the designed displacement, the belt armor was submerged with just a 3¬∞ heel, and training all of the main battery turrets to one side would produce a heel of 2¬∞. Incremental increases in weight during the construction process, which Huin was unable to supervise, left little margin for the belt to remain above the water. These increases forced compromises elsewhere in the ship's armor protection, most notably the barbettes, which were criticized at the time; nothing could be done, however, due to the strict limit placed on displacement. The cofferdam also proved to be highly susceptible to uncontrollable flooding, which would have serious effects on the vessel's stability. Service history Map of the western Mediterranean, where Bouvet spent the majority of her peacetime career Bouvet was laid down at the French Navy shipyard in Lorient on 16 January 1893, and was launched on 27 April 1896. After completing fitting-out work, she began sea trials on 5 March 1898. The ship was intended to have conducted her trials from Brest, but she was sent to Toulon to reinforce the Mediterranean Squadron due to the Fashoda crisis with Britain. She was commissioned into the French Navy in June 1898. The ship was named in honor of Admiral Fran√ßois Joseph Bouvet. Throughout the ship's peacetime career, she was occupied with routine training exercises that included gunnery training, combined maneuvers with torpedo boats and submarines, and practicing attacking coastal fortifications. Since Bouvet was one of the most modern French battleships in the late 1890s and early 1900s, she spent this time in the Mediterranean Squadron, France's primary fleet. One of the largest of these exercises was conducted between March and July 1900, and involved the Mediterranean Squadron and the Northern Squadron. On 6 March, Bouvet joined the battleships Brennus, , , Charles Martel, and and four protected cruisers for maneuvers off Golfe-Juan on the C√¥te d'Azur, including night firing training. Over the course of April, the ships visited numerous French ports along the Mediterranean coast, and on 31 May the fleet steamed to Corsica for a visit that lasted until 8 June. After completing its own exercises in the Mediterranean, the Mediterranean Squadron rendezvoused with the Northern Squadron off Lisbon, Portugal in late June before proceeding to Quiberon Bay for joint maneuvers in July. The maneuvers concluded with a naval review in Cherbourg on 19 July for President √âmile Loubet. On 1 August, the Mediterranean Fleet departed for Toulon, arriving on 14 August. Bouvet was assigned to the 2nd Battle Division of the Mediterranean Squadron, along with Jaur√©guiberry and the new battleship , the latter becoming the divisional flagship. Bouvet departed Toulon on 29 January 1903 in company with the battleships , Gaulois, and Charlemagne, four cruisers, and accompanying destroyers for gunnery training off Golfe-Juan. At the time, Bouvet and Gaulois were the 2nd Division, with Bouvet in the lead; the other two ships formed the 1st Division. Two days later, when the divisions were ordered to change from two columns to a single line ahead for shooting drills, Bouvet failed to take her prescribed position and instead turned too closely to Gaulois. The latter accidentally struck the former, with Bouvet losing a ladder and incurring damage to one of the deck-mounted torpedo tubes. Gaulois had two armor plates torn from her bow. Both ships' captains were relieved of command over the incident. In October, Bouvet and the rest of the Mediterranean Squadron battleships steamed to Palma de Mallorca, and on their return to Toulon they conducted training exercises. The year 1904 saw the Mediterranean Squadron visit Souda Bay in Crete, Beirut, Smyrna, and Salonika in the Ottoman Empire, Messina in Sicily, and Piraeus, Greece during a cruise of the eastern Mediterranean in the middle of the year. The following year passed uneventfully for Bouvet, and on 10 April 1906, she, I√©na, and Gaulois were sent to Italy in the aftermath of the eruption of Mount Vesuvius. The three ships carried some 9,000 rations and their crews assisted the victims to recover from the disaster. The division returned to France in time for a naval review on 16 September held in Marseilles that included detachments from Britain, Spain, and Italy. Bouvet and the other French ships then returned to Toulon. The following year, in January 1907, Bouvet was withdrawn from front- line service with the Mediterranean Squadron. Now part of the Second Squadron, she was retained on active service for the year, but with a reduced crew. In July 1908, the Mediterranean Fleet was reorganized and Bouvet was attached to the 3rd Battleship Division as its flagship, under the command of (Rear Admiral) Laurent Marin-Darbel, along with Jaur√©guiberry and the battleship . Bouvet in the Dardanelles in 1915 Beginning in January 1909, with the commissioning of the six and s, the Mediterranean Squadron was reorganized into two battle squadrons; Bouvet was at that time assigned to the 3rd Division, part of the 2nd Battle Squadron, still the flagship of Marin-Darbel. Her place was taken the following year by Saint Louis, and she remained out of service that year, with the exception of during the fleet maneuvers conducted in June, which she joined. In January 1911, she returned to service as the flagship of Adam in the 2nd Division of the 2nd Battle Squadron. On 5 October, the fleet was again reorganized and her place in what was now the 3rd Battle Squadron was taken by Charles Martel. On 16 October 1912, Bouvet, Gaulois, Saint Louis, Carnot, Mass√©na, and Jaur√©guiberry were activated for training duties as the 3rd Squadron of the Mediterranean Squadron; in July 1913, they were joined by Charlemagne. The squadron was dissolved on 11 November, and Bouvet, Saint Louis, and Gaulois were assigned to the (Supplementary Division). Training activities continued into 1914, and in March, the division joined the rest of the Mediterranean Squadron, which was now re-designated as the (First Naval Army) for gunnery training off Corsica. Additional maneuvers were conducted beginning on 13 May, during which the fleet visited Bizerte in French Tunisia, Algiers in French Algeria, and Ajaccio, Corsica. =World War I= Following the outbreak of World War I in July 1914, France announced general mobilization on 1 August. The next day, Admiral Augustin Bou√© de Lapeyr√®re ordered the entire French fleet to begin raising steam at 22:15 so the ships could sortie early the following morning. The bulk of the fleet, including the (designated as \\"Group C\\"), was sent to French North Africa, where they would escort the vital troop convoys carrying elements of the French Army from North Africa back to France to counter the expected German invasion. At the time, the division was commanded by √âmile Paul Amable Gu√©pratte, and it was tasked with guarding against a possible attack by the German battlecruiser , which instead fled to the Ottoman Empire. Bouvet and her division mates steamed first to Algiers and then Oran. There, they rendezvoused with one of the convoys and covered its voyage north to S√®te on 6 August. From there, Bouvet and the battleships proceeded on to Toulon, before departing again for Algiers for another escort mission. Once the French Army units had completed their crossing by late August, the Group C ships were tasked with patrolling merchant traffic between Tunis and Sicily to prevent contraband shipments to the Central Powers. In November, she and the armored cruiser were sent to relieve the British armored cruisers and as guard ships at the northern entrance to the Suez Canal. She remained there only briefly, however, before she was ordered north to the Dardanelles to relieve the battleship on 20 December. Over the coming months, the Triple Entente amassed a large fleet tasked with breaking through the Ottoman defenses that guarded the straits. During this period, before the start of major offensive operations, the Anglo-French fleet alternated between anchorages at Tenedos and Mudros Bay on the island of Lemnos, and it was tasked with patrolling the entrance to the straits to ensure that Goeben‚Äîwhich had by then been transferred to the Ottoman Navy as Yavuz Sultan Selim‚Äîdid not attempt to sortie. On 1 February 1915, the ships sailed to Sigri on the island of Lesbos. Dardanelles campaign By mid-February 1915, the French and British had assembled a fleet of four French and twelve British battleships, including Bouvet, to lead the assault on the Dardanelles. The plan called for Ottoman defenses to be neutralized to allow the fleet to enter the Sea of Marmara and attack Constantinople directly. The first stage of the attack began on 19 February, which saw Bouvet and Suffren, together with the British battlecruiser and the pre-dreadnought battleships , , and , bombard the coastal defenses protecting the entrance of the straits. During the bombardment, Bouvet assisted the battleship Suffren by sending firing corrections via radio while Gaulois provided counter-battery fire to suppress the Ottoman coastal artillery. Another attempt was made six days later, with Bouvet again spotting for Gaulois; this attack was more successful, and the French and British battleships silenced the outer fortresses, allowing minesweepers to enter the area and begin clearing the minefields protecting the straits. The French division steamed into the Gulf of Saros on the Aegean coast of the Gallipoli Peninsula on 1 March to scout Ottoman positions in the area. They then covered the British battleships as they bombarded Ottoman positions in the straits on 5 March, before taking their turn the next day, when they attacked the fortification at Dardanus. On 18 March, the French and British squadrons made another attack on the straits, directed at the inner ring of fortresses that guarded the narrowest part of the Dardanelles. The larger British contingent, commanded by Rear Admiral John de Robeck, was to make the initial attack at longer range, led by the powerful dreadnought battleship ; once the batteries were reduced, the French ships, under Gu√©pratte, were to enter the straits and attack at closer range. Bouvet and Suffren were to attack the fortresses on the Asian side of the straits, while Gaulois and Charlemagne were to silence the batteries on the European side. Mistakenly believing the Ottoman guns to have been largely neutralized by the British bombardment, Gu√©pratte led his ships to within of the inner fortresses and engaged in an artillery duel. Suffren and Bouvet operated as a pair, taking alternating passes at high speed to make it more difficult for the Ottoman gunners to score hits. Nevertheless, by 14:00, Bouvet had taken several hits and two of her casemate guns had been knocked out. A serious fire had also been started on her bridge, though she had succeeded in neutralizing the Hamidieh battery. In the course of the attack on the fortresses, Bouvet sustained eight hits from Turkish artillery fire. Her forward turret was disabled after the propellant gas extractor broke down. At around 13:45, de Robeck had ordered Gu√©pratte to withdraw his ships so their British counterparts could take their turn against the Ottoman fortifications. Bouvet was at that time battling the fort at Namazieh, and her commander, (Ship of the line captain) Rageot de la Touche, initially did not respond to Gu√©pratte's instruction to follow Suffren out of the narrows. After Gu√©pratte again ordered him to break off contact, de la Touche turned Bouvet south to withdraw. Shortly thereafter, Bouvet was rocked by a major explosion, followed by a large cloud of red-black smoke; observers aboard the other ships could not immediately tell whether she had been hit by an Ottoman shell, torpedoed by a shore-mounted torpedo battery, or if she had struck a mine. The escorting destroyers and picket boats raced to the scene to pick up her crew, but in the span of just two minutes, Bouvet capsized and sank. A total of 75 of her crew were pulled from the water; 24 officers and 619 enlisted men died in the sinking. Most of the survivors were rescued by the British destroyer . The ship was in poor condition at the time due to her age, which likely contributed to her rapid sinking, though there was some speculation that her ammunition magazine exploded. Gu√©pratte himself remarked that \\"that ship must have had poor stability.\\" It was later determined that Bouvet had struck a mine, which was part of a field that had been freshly laid a week before the attack, and was unknown to the Allies. Despite the sinking of Bouvet, the first such loss of the day, the British remained unaware of the minefield, thinking the explosion had been caused by a shell or torpedo. Subsequently, two British pre-dreadnoughts, and , were sunk and the battlecruiser Inflexible was damaged by the same minefield. Suffren and Gaulois were both badly damaged by coastal artillery during the engagement. The loss of Bouvet and the two British battleships during the 18 March attack was a major factor in the decision to abandon a naval strategy to take Constantinople, and instead opt for the Gallipoli land campaign. While the Franco-British forces began preparations for the attack, Bouvets place in the fleet was filled by . Wreck In the early 2010s, Turkish marine archaeologists conducted sonar surveys of many of the wrecks from the Dardanelles campaign, including Bouvet. Research on the wrecks had long been difficult, as the area is a busy maritime artery and the strong current combine to make diving difficult. The survey of Bouvet, which lies upside down on the sea floor, revealed that a 305 mm shell from an Ottoman shore battery had struck the ship at the waterline amidships on the same side as she struck the mine, which contributed to the fatal flooding that caused her to rapidly capsize and sink.

The Anglo-Egyptian Bank (later Barclays) opened a branch in 1888, and Credit Foncier (later Cr√©dit Agricole) entered in 1920. There were also, by the start of the 20th century, four other small, family-owned banks - Cuby Brothers, Benzecry (El Banquerito), Rugeroni Brothers, and Marrache and Sons - but by 1940 these had ceased operating. A.L. Galliano Bankers survived the Great Depression, the Spanish Civil War, and both world wars, albeit with difficulty.

During the 1980s hip hop culture in Cuba was mainly centred on breakdancing. But by the 1990s, with the collapse of the Soviet Union and the onset of the Special Period, young \\"raperos\\" were seeking ways to express their frustrations. Early days: Importation Initially hip hop was viewed with suspicion, not just by the government, but by many in the community as well. With raperos emulating US rappers' aggressive posturing and lyrical content, hip hop was seen as just another cultural invasion from the US, bringing with it the violence and problems of the ghettos. The importation and the birth of Cuban rap could be debatable, but many argue that the importation of U.S rap and its influence was brought from Miami. Rap hit Cuba approximately quarter century ago but it was not imported to Cuba until the 1990s after the fall of the Soviet Union.International Reporting Project - Fellows' Stories However it existed among young moneros, who had a tremendous oral ability and linguistic creativity. At the beginning of establishing Rap in Cuba rap like rock was perceived as a foreign import and while it was never forbidden, neither was it promoted or encouraged‚Äù Pacini-Hernandez, Deborah and Reebee Garofalo.\\"The emergence of Rap Cubano: An historical perspective.\\" In music space, and place, ed.

Ashgate, 2004 The Cuban government changed its perceptions about hip hop during 1999 when they declared it as an authentic expression of Cuban culture. In addition the government formed the Agencia Cubana de Rap (The Cuban Rap Agency) that provides state-run record label and hip hop magazine, and began supporting the annual Cuban Hip Hop festival. Cuban rappers injected a renovating energy into Cuban music that was taken from hip hop culture.https://moodle.brandeis.edu/file.php/3404/pdfs/baker-hip-hop- revolucion.pdf Rap in Cuba began to emerge precisely during the gangsta rap period in the United States which included artists like 2Pac, Notorious B.I.G, Ice-T, Snoop Dogg and many more influential gangster rappers. Gradually this began to change as raperos began to express their own reality and make use of traditional Cuban culture. One sentiment expressed involved how Cuban politics were not keeping pace with social reality. All Cubans are discouraged from visiting government-designated 'tourist zones,' such as the fancy restaurants and night clubs in Old Havana, and police will ask most who show up there for ID. But statistics show that the police arrest Afrocubans all over the island more often than Whites. Many Afrocubans believed government assumes Blacks are more likely to be involved in criminal activity.Wunderlich, Annelise. ‚ÄúCuban Hip-hop: Making Space for New Voices of Dissent.‚Äù In The Vinyl Ain‚Äôt Final: Hip Hop and the Globalization of Black Popular Culture, ed. by Dipannita Basu and Sidney J. Lemelle, 167-79. London; Ann Arbor, MI: Pluto Press, 2006. This exclusion from night life led to the importance of house parties where raperos were able to establish their own \\"underground\\" hip hop scene. The financial constraints of tourist geared night clubs that only accept dollars or venues that cost up to the equivalent of a standard monthly Cuban salary for entry also aided in the significance of house parties in the Cuban hip hop scene.Baker, Geoffrey. 2006. \\"La Habana que no conoces: Cuban rap and the social construction of urban space.\\" Ethnomusicology Forum 15, no. 2: 215-46 The small, underground gatherings or house parties were referred to as bonches. The bonches were for the true hip hop fans who were into the less accessible rap in Cuba. \\"These bonches can be considered the seeds of today's Cuban rap community.\\" As bonches gained popularity, they became too large for private homes, so aspiring DJ Adalberto Jimenez found a public space in Havana, which he called La Mo√±a. The venue did charge a small fee, but it stayed more of a social than commercial club, remaining loyal to the underground scene. Many moneros were interested in creating their own rap, but lack of equipment prevented the formation of professional Cuban hip hop groups until the establishment of the Havana Hip Hop Festival.Pacini-Hernandez, Deborah and Reebee Garofalo. \\"The emergence of rap Cubano: An historical perspective.\\" in Music, Space, and Place ed.

The annual Hip Hop festival consisted of 50 Cuban and 12 foreign groups: Mos Def and The Roots have supported the event as well as many others. As Hip-hop became more popular, it reached the youth of Cuba and many other countries. As a result, several thousand people globally have attended the festival in previous years.Baker, Geoffrey. 2005. \\"¬°Hip hop, Revoluci√≥n! Nationalizing Rap in Cuba.\\" Ethnomusicology 49, no. 3: 368-402 In the mid-1990s, the music scene was one of the most promising for Cubans to meet tourists and gain possible access to much needed hard currency. Hip-hop developed new dance moves involving the 'solo' female body: the despelote (all-over-the-place) and tembleque (shake-shudder) and the subasta de la cintura (waist auction). These moves define a solo female dance style which involves fast movement and turning/swirling of the area from below shoulders and chest to pelvis (as if one was hula hoop-ing or belly dancing). Often accompanied by hand and body gestures mimicking self-pleasuring, it constituted a noticeable change in dance style, of women dancing to be 'looked at' both by their partners, by other prospective partners, and by other spectators, using their body as a major asset. This was in contrast to traditional dancing such as normative couple dancing.https://moodle.brandeis.edu/file.php/3404/pdfs/fairley_dancing_reggaeton.pdf Birth of a Cuban scene The change in both attitude towards hip hop and the move towards home grown expression was in part facilitated by the involvement of New Afrikan Revoluationay Nehanda Abiodun,see Tanya L. Saunders's 2008 dissertation from University of Michigan Ann Arbor The Cuban Remix: Rethinking Culture and Political Participation in Contemporary Cuba a U.S. Black Liberation Army activist in political exile in Cuba. The U.S. is the birthplace of hip hop, so of course played a major role in the birth of hip hop in Cuba. U.S. hip hop artists continue to be hip hop's most important innovators and are very influential to Cuban rappers. Cuban rappers admire the success of U.S. rappers and desire to achieve the same amount of success, so they begin to model themselves after them.Pacini-Hernandez, Deborah and Reebee Garofalo. \\"The emergence of rap Cubano: An historical perspective.\\" In Music, Space, and Place, ed. Whitely, Bennett, and Hawkins, 89-107. Burlington, VT: Ashgate, 2004. Hip hop's transfer to Alamar (the birthplace of rap cubano), a suburb east of Havana (with the best radio reception to Miami radio stations 99 JAMS and HOT 105), was so successful that in 1995 Rodolfo Renzoli, a rapper from Alamar's original hip hop collective, Grupo Uno, organized Cuba's first hip hop festival with the aid of the Asociaci√≥n de Hermanos Sais(AHS). Despite poor promotion and the remote location, the first festival, organized as a friendly competition among the growing group of rap artists in and around Havana, became a huge success with moneros' and 'raperos'. 'Rap cubano emerged as a distinct genre when Amenaza (now known internationally as the Orishas - France, EMI) incorporated Afro-Cuban bata percussion into their performance at the 1996 festival, winning them first place in the competition. The same year, Cuba's first all-female rap group, , secured second place for their energetically charged rap flow and performance. By 1999, through the aid of the Hip Hop Manifesto (written by DJ Ariel Fernandez), rap cubano and rock music (another marginalized musical genre in Cuba) was declared \\"an authentic expression of Cuban culture\\" by Abel Prieto, Cuba's Minister of Culture. Fidel Castro deemed hip hop music to be at the \\"vanguard of the Revolution\\" because of its revolutionary message.Baker, Geoffrey. 2008. \\"The Politics of Dancing.\\" In Reading Reggaeton (forthcoming, Duke University Press). This resulted in the formation of the Agencia Cubana de Rap (The Cuban Rap Agency). The Agencia Cubana de Rap is the state's organization that runs a record label and hip hop magazine, Movimiento. Upset with what she saw as blind imitation of commercial US rap culture with its depiction of thug life, violence, and misogyny, Abiodun began working with the Malcolm X Grassroots Movement in the US to bring progressive US hip hop artists to Cuba. This led to the Black August benefit concerts held in New York City and Havana. The project has featured progressive artists such as Erykah Badu, David Banner, Common, dead prez, Fat Joe, the Roots, Jean Grae, Les Nubians, Chuck D, Gil Scott-Heron, Dave Chappelle, Tony Touch, Black Thought, Mos Def, Talib Kweli, La Bruha, Imani Uzuri, Jeru and the Coup. The Black August Collective that was formed, and the concerts these progressive US artists gave in Cuba, played a key role in expanding and raising the profile of conscious, politicized rap within Cuba. Many Cuban rappers felt an affinity to the revolutionary aspects of the work these artists created.Saunders, Tanya L. : Black Thoughts, Black Activism: Cuban Underground Hip-hop and Afro-Latino Countercultures of Modernity in Latin American Perspectives, first published on December 1, 2011 The Black August Hip Hop Collective Statement of Purpose offers that \\"Our goal is to bring culture and politics together and allow them to naturally evolve into a unique hip hop consciousness that informs our collective struggle for a more just, equitable and human world\\".Baker, Geoffrey. 2005. \\" Hip Hop, Revoluci√≥n!

Ethnomusicology 49, no. 3: 388 Despite the movement's association with an identity other than Cuban, the government supported The Black August Collective and allowed the rappers to perform as they were supportive of the revolution. The youth of Cuba were fascinated not only by this style of music, but also by the Black Pride of the performers.Wunderlich, Annelise: ‚ÄúCuban Hip-hop: Making Space for New Voices of Dissent,‚Äù ‚ÄòThe Vinyl Ain‚Äôt Final: Hip Hop and the Globalization of Black Popular Culture,‚Äô Basu, Dipannita and Lemelle, Sidney ed., London: Pluto Press, 2006, page 172. This consciousness of struggle and achieving the goals of revolution are a key characteristic of a majority of Cuban hip hop today.Baker, Geoffrey. 2005. \\" Hip Hop, Revoluci√≥n! Nationalizing Rap in Cuba\\". Ethnomusicology 49, no. 3: 383, 388 In the US, early hip hop was a DJ- based music: it was the creative transformation of the turntable from a mere playback device to a full-fledged percussion instrument that established \\"break beat\\" music as a new cultural form. Cuba however, had neither turntables nor black vinyl, making it impossible for these exotic new sounds to be duplicate within Cuba. Due to a lack of sophisticated equipment in Cuba, the hip hop that has emerged features simple beatsWunderlich, Annelise: ‚ÄúCuban Hip-hop: Making Space for New Voices of Dissent,‚Äù which naturally leads to an emphasis on the lyrical content. Just like earlier American hip hop, Cuban hip hop has developed as an outlet to convey politically charged and socially conscious messages. These messages, over a simple beat, create a raw \\"old school\\" sound which draws the underground and alternative hip hop crowd such as the artists mentioned above for some authentic inspiration. Some say that Havana, host of the Hip Hop Festival, is the new home of old school. Another contributor to hip hop's recognition as authentic Cuban culture was Grupo Uno, a collective from an East Havana cultural center, and rock promoter Rodolfo Renzoli. In 1995, with the help of the Asociaci√≥n Hermanos Sa√≠z (AHS), an offshoot of the Communist Youth Organization that promotes young artists, they began an annual hip hop festival, known as the Festival de Rap Cubano, in the Havana district of Alamar, seen by many as the birthplace of Cuban hip hop.. The event aimed to provide a public arena for Cuban rappers to display their talents in the center of a poor, black neighborhood teeming with youthful energy, creative spirit, and cultural pride. In an effort to spurn political criticism that Cuban rap was not nationalistic, the festival teamed with the Asociacion Hermanos Sais to help jump start the project. The greatest boosts to this movement came from the Hermanos Saiz Associations support, the Orishas phenomenon, the foundation of the Cuban Agency of Rap and an increase in public appreciation. The aesthetics and style of the Cuban rappers draw from Afro-Cuban rhythms and roots, the influences of jazz, reggae, funk, soul and rock and roll, and social consciousness. Among the premier bands participating in this festival are Obsession, Doble Filo, Hermanazos and Anonimo Consejo. Attracted to the social themes embedded in the lyrics and the energetic, rhythmic beats, the festival was a hit. Hundreds of rappers converged on the stage and for the first time were publicly able to share their words and ideas. The winner of the festivals rap contest was a group by the name of Primera Base, a name that made reference to both Cuba's national sport, baseball, and that a base for rap in Cuba was being established.Pacini- Hernandez, Deborah and Reebee, Garofalo.\\"The emergence of Rap Cubano: An historical perspective.\\" In music space, and place, ed.

Ariel Fern√°ndez of AHS compares Cuban hip hop with the Nueva Trova of the 1960s - a revolution within the revolution. In his words, \\"The social role it is playing is very important, Cuban rap is criticizing the deficiencies that exist in society, but in a constructive way, educating youth and opening spaces to create a better society.\\" previously to hip hop, protest music in Cuba have been growing a heritage of three decades; adopted from the tradition of Nueva Cancion, emerged the Cuban protest songs of Nueva Trova. many parallels connect those two styles Nueva Trova and hip hop in Cuba, where both were \\"misunderstood by state\\" in the beginning then they became adopted by the Cuban government.Baker, Geoffrey. 2006. \\"La Habana que no conoces: Cuban rap and the social construction of urban space.\\" Ethnomusicology Forum 15, no. 2: 215-46.a Nueva Trova, became the formal representing genre for the Union of Young Communists of the early revolutionary Cuba, same as it is the case for the Cuban hip hop scene, where in its early stages, was adopted by AHS, streamed from the Communist Youth Organization, to become a form of protest songs that the president himself would have a hand in its development. Harry Belafonte is credited with explaining hip hop culture to Fidel Castro at a luncheon. Fidel was so impressed that he called hip hop \\"the vanguard of the revolution\\" and was even seen rapping alongside the group Doble Filo at the opening of a baseball game.. Fernandez claimed that the founders of Nueva Trova \\"showed the direction for how to make revolution with the music... those musicians explored how, as a revolutionary, you talk about the things that are bad within the revolution\\" (Foehr 2001:35) Hip hop and rap clubs, while scarce today in Cuba, have emerged as an open and affordable gathering space for lower and middle-class Cubans who are increasingly excluded from other forms of Havana nightlife due to rising prices, dollarization of popular clubs and increasing segregation on behalf of tourists and the wealthy Cuban elite. Under these divisive socio-economic conditions, hip hop and rap concerts have now come to represent a space of open debate and social and political discussion for many young Cubans. Topics such as racism, tourism and police harassment are often addressed openly in these spaces through music and performance as well as through participatory discussion.Baker, Geoffrey. 2006. \\"La Habana que no conoces: Cuban rap and the social construction of urban space.\\" Ethnomusicology Forum 15, no. 2: 215-46 Many Cuban rappers use their music as an opportunity to speak out against problems within Cuba or on global issues including war, racism, and pollution.Associated Press. ‚ÄúCuban Hip-Hop Reaches Crossroads.‚Äù CBS News. Many Cuban rappers refer to the subjects of their rap as temas sociales or social themes. By involving these social and political themes, they try to make their music constructive and influential to their listeners. Two important themes that are manifested in many of the songs involves the global issue of AIDS and the destructiveness of war.Music, Space and Place: Popular Music and Cultural Identity Published October 4, 2004.

Although these themes may be useful to the listeners in Cuba, many people speak against the governments use of music to influence people.Cuban Rap Music: Is it occupying its rightful place in life? Politics is so deeply rooted in the hip hop scene in Cuba that the revolutionary image of Che Guevara is frequently seen, as the late figure represents the early stage in the Revolution and embodies youthful idealism.

Ethnomusicology 49, no. 3: 378 The United States was such a big influence due to the close economic relationship between the United States and Cuba, as well as the successful U.S. intervention in Cuba's War of Independence (1890‚Äì1899) against Spain. Due to a corrupt history of U.S. involvement in Cuban affairs, which culminated during the reign of Cuban Dictator, Fulgencio Batista, Fidel Castro's Revolution was created as anti- colonialist and anti-imperialist. With the ongoing issues between Cuban and the US, including numerous assassination attempts on Fidel Castro by the U.S. government, a cultural revolution within Cuba denied citizens from listening to U.S. forms of music, resulting in the formation of a small underground music community within Havana.Music, Space and Place: Popular Music and Cultural Identity In the First Havana Rap Festival in 1996, the Orishas won first prize and signed their first record deal.Amenaza: Cuban rap In the article Music, Space and Place, the authors cite Ice-T, Ice Cube, Snoop Doggy Dogg, Dr. Dre, 2Pac, and the Notorious BIG as models and favorites among the artists in Cuba.

Cuban hip hop thrives while it is contingent upon Fidel Castro's maxim \\"Within the revolution, everything,\\" an idea that allows for critical debate as long as it is not seen as counter-revolutionary. Inevitably, as an art form based on individuals' expressions of everyday life, Cuban hip hop often finds itself at the cutting edge of this boundary. As with all industries in Cuba, music production is closely monitored by the government. However, due to publicity campaigns run by hip hop zealots such as Havana University Professor Pablo Herrera, Cuban hip hop has been accepted by the authorities as \\"an authentic expression of cubanidad\\" and as such has elicited funding from Cuba's Minister of Culture, Abel Prieto, for the annual rap festival. Every day is a social and political balancing act, however, and rap cubano faces increasing encroachment by reggaeton, a music with less political and arguably more misogynistic lyrics that is \\"easier\\" to dance too. The AHS and ACR continue to represent only a handful of the islands estimated 200 rap groups (according to Herrera in 2007) and the current Director of the national rap agency (ACR), Magia Lopes (a rapper in mixed-sex rap group, , with her husband, El Tipo Este or Alexei Rodriguez), has organized all-female rap showcases. This 'feminism' in rap cubano is predominantly aimed at denouncing the machista attitude prevalent in Cuban society in spite of tremendous strides for women's rights by the national, state-run Federation of Cuban Women (FMC). Much is written about these Cuban 'hip hop feminists' by scholars Marc Perry (2004), Margaux Joffe (2005), Dr. Sujatha Fernandes (2006, 2007) and Dr. Tanya Saunders (2009).Tanya L.

The majority of these women have left Cuba, however, along with many other male rappers due to ongoing censorship and lack of performance opportunities. The female group Explosion Femenina (or Oye Habana) combines sex appeal with wit to captivate its audience.Wunderlich, Annelise: \\"Cuban Hip Hop: Underground revolution\\" Cubans 2001 Cuban Hip Hop. Accessed February 7, 2007. http://journalism.berkeley.edu/projects/cubans2001/story-hiphop.html Other female rappers like Mariana and Telmary have broken out of all-male crews to establish their own voice and talents. Although Cuban hip hop challenges certain norms, bands must be careful not to offend the government with their edgy lyrics, and a careful balance of the two has ultimately led to state-run promotion of various bands, i.e. Cuban stars Anonimo Consejo, and funding from the government for tens of thousands of dollars of audio equipment through the Young Communist Union's cultural arm, Asociacion de los Hermanos Saiz.Wunderlich, Annelise: ‚ÄúCuban Hip-hop: Making Space for New Voices of Dissent,‚Äù ‚ÄòThe Vinyl Ain‚Äôt Final: Hip Hop and the Globalization of Black Popular Culture,‚Äô Basu, Dipannita and Lemelle, Sidney ed., London: Pluto Press, 2006, pages 173-175. While rap, as stated before, has played a huge part in giving marginalized Afro-Cuban youth a voice to express their discomforts with ongoing racism in an \\"egalitarian\\" society, the ‚Äúunderground‚Äù rap scene is increasingly at odds with more mainstream Cuban hip hop and reggaeton. According to Geoff Baker, rap artists ‚Äúderide reggaeton for being trite and mindless, for promoting pointless diversion and for dancing over social commitment and reflection.‚Äù One popular rap group Los Aldeanos MySpace.com - Los Aldeanos - - Hip Hop - www.myspace.com/losaldeanos has been particularly vocal in their critique of reggaeton. The lyrics of ‚ÄúReparticion de bienes‚Äù express the popularly held beliefs in the rap community about the reggaeton genre being for sell outs while rap is ‚Äúfor maturing the mind of the immature.‚Äù This ongoing debate is also reflective of Cuba's particular struggle with the growing prominence of capitalism since the start of the Special Period and the disconnect many Cuban hip hop artists feel between the current state of society and its more collectively focused roots. As such raperos often find themselves harassed by the Cuban police, whose job includes guarding against counter-revolutionary acts. However the perception of what is and what is not counter-revolutionary is a debate unto itself. To illustrate the dynamics of the situation, during one instance of police trying to shut a hip hop event down for being subversive, the minister of culture arrived to insist that what was taking place was vital to the revolution and must go ahead. La Mo√±a in Cuban hip hop In the early stages of Cuban hip hop there was minimal technology to record their beloved hip hop. This made it virtually impossible to duplicate the exotic sounds in Cuba. This lack of technology led to the private gatherings of very devoted fans called, bonches. ‚ÄúThese bonches can be considered the seeds of today‚Äôs Cuban rap community.‚Äù Only the most dedicated fans would be in attendance and they would receive an understanding of raps evolvement and fame outside of Cuba. Eventually, these bonches attracted too many people and they were forced out of private homes. In 1994, rap entrepreneur, Adalberto J√≠menez was able to get a public space for these amazing hip hop gatherings. This public space was known as, el local de la Mo√±a. This place would be a spot to find beautiful women, great drinks, and innovative Cuban hip hop. Mo√±as were so popular that it became the Cuban word for rap and Mo√±eros for rappers or rap enthusiasts. This is not a place for tourists, but mostly for young, black Cubans. La Mo√±a moved around a great deal and became a sort of traveling party in Old Havana. La Mo√±a charged a 5-peso admission charge, which would have translated to about 20 cents. In January 1999, La Mo√±a moved to a tiny club called La Pampa and they had raised the price of admission to 20 pesos. This price is too high for a lot of the destitute Cubans in Havana. La Mo√±a still remains the only place for mo√±eros to hear the latest underground rap in Cuba.Pacini-Hernandez, Deborah and Reebee Garofalo. \\"The emergence of rap Cubano: An historical perspective.\\" In Music, Space, and Place, ed. Whitely, Bennett, and Hawkins, 91-93. Burlington, VT: Ashgate, 2004. In the underground scene of Cuba, freestyle becomes a manifestation of a communal establishment (usually the community of rappers and audience come to form a cycle) where those who are not rapping provide vocalized \\"backing track\\", opened for anyone to jump it for a freestyle. as it mentioned in Geoff Baker's study, who relates his word to Firth and Martin Stokes; that those music-making circles, \\"enable the community to generate(rather than simply embody) a different social order and a distinct set of moral values: Rap Penas-a communal interactive performances in which a number of artists share the space, collaborate, creating a space for freestyle, which challenges the social order, where speaking about sensitive issues in the community, are limited or even banned.Baker, Geoffrey. 2006. \\"La Habana que no conoces: Cuban rap and the social construction of urban space.\\" Ethnomusicology Forum 15, no. 2: 215-46. Criticism of Cuban hip hop Many have criticized the new movement of Cuban Reggaeton and hip hop artists for their recent change in meaning of the music. Cuban rappers attack social and political issues concerning Cuba such as racism, class struggles and police harassment etc. But as pressure for commercial success increases, some artists have toned down their political or socially conscious content, and instead have focused on tropes common in commercial rap. Many of the grass roots artists do not understand the recent change of rapping about partying, cars, and women. \\"Hip-hop in the United States started out as a voice of protest, an alternative voice for urban, inner-city youth to voice their grievances, to talk about their living conditions, their hopes and aspirations,\\" said Abiodun, a member of the Black Liberation Party before fleeing to Cuba 14 years ago as a U.S. fugitive facing racketeering charges. \\"But now what we see in terms of rap in the United States, for the most part, it's really not talking about anything.\\"\\"Cuban Hip-Hop Reaches Crossroads\\"http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2004/10/04/entertainment/main647330.shtml Also many criticize the objectification of females in the dancing and in videos. Some see it as dominant if the women dance in front of the men in a \\"doggy style\\" position, but critics see it as a way of letting the male take initial control over the female. Also many argue that the females in those music videos are objectifying themselves to seem lower than men. Music videos are becoming more explicit. To gain a following of their music, Cuban hip hop artists are continuously using provocatively dressed females. This sexual image in their videos is taking away from the audiences ability to actually listen to the lyrics and understand them. The lyrics being addressed recently by Cuban hip hop artists stand as a rebellion against the many downfalls, such as poverty and racism, that their nation is currently fighting. It would benefit all of Cuba to take the time to understand the lyrics and not just watch the images of the videos. Sexually charged dancing (like grinding and \\"doggy style\\") often associated with hip hop, are not the only things criticized. In recent years, Hip-hop has merged with Cuban culture to the point it can be heard in parades, school dances, and clubs. This has given rise to the problem of children, 16 or younger, hearing and singing the lyrics found in Cuban hip hop and reggaeton, which often make reference to sexual activities. Cuban hip hop that addresses political issues, however, are not widely commercialized. These types of music that can be listen to by all Cubans of any age, tend to stay underground and are suppressed by the government, leaving a majority of Cubans no choice but to listen to salsa, reggaeton, or mainstream rap.\\"MUSIC-CUBA: Rap Calls for 'Revolution Within the Revolution'\\"  Merit of Different Styles According to Geoff Baker's interpretation of the ‚ÄúCentro de Investigaci√≥n y Desarrollo de la M√∫sica Cubana (CIDMUC) in Havana,‚Äù found in ‚ÄúThe Politics of Dancing,‚Äù rap promotes social awareness better than reggaeton. Since rap is verbally expressed with a lesser focus on dancing the artists can more easily convey their messages. In contrast reggaeton places a larger emphasis on movement expression than vocal expression. Dance creativity does have definite merit. However, lyrics are more capable to express opinions. Furthermore, Baker attributes a lack of originality to reggaetone because only a single unchanging beat may be heard throughout a whole track. An article from a major Cuban social change news source, ‚ÄúCubanet,‚Äù reinforces the opinion that rap motivates change while reggaeton inspires merely dancing. The article \\"Cuba's rebel rap roars for 'revolution within the revolution'\\" quotes Cuban rapper Cabera, aka Papa Humbertico explaining that rap talks ‚Äúabout the reality of a Cuban's life in our songs, what happens to us in the street.‚Äù In contrast Cabera believes ‚Äú\\"All reggaeton does is make people stupid.‚Äù The author of the article assumes that Cabera's statement derives from the ‚Äúpreoccupation‚Äù with dance of reggaeton. In summary, some believe that rap is more easily expressive while reggaeton conveys its message less understandably through dance. Marketing of Different Styles The dissemination of reggaeton in Cuba is altogether peculiar and familiar. The guerilla marketing of reggaeton with its homespun production value, bicycle taxi advertising and the informal mass distribution in urban areas has led to its accessibility to the Cuban community at large. This rings familiar with US music industry marketing strategies. The peculiarity of reggaeton's dissemination is raised when contextualized within the nationalistic Cuban hip hop scene. Socially conscious hip hop was nationalized into Cuba \\"as a process of engagement between artists and audiences mediated by the state, rather than by the music industry or by recording technology.\\" This stark contrast between the sources of support and means of dissemination is just one of several reasons of conflict between the two genres in Cuban popular music. Nationalism in Cuban hip hop There are many ways in which Cuban hip hop artists achieve a sense of nationalism through their music. Many Cuban hip hop artists attempt through the musical backing track arrangements and sounds. Rhythms borrowing from traditional Cuban music style have been incorporated in hip hop music. Native instruments such as bata drums, maracas, and guaguanco have been part of the indigenization hip hop music in Cuba. In addition to musical instrumentation, language also plays a large part in the shaping and nationalization of Cuban hip hop. Language barriers between the US and Cuba allowed for Cuban hip hoppers to embrace the musical aesthetic of the music, but leave behind the lyrical content. This can be seen through similarity between Cuban and US hip hop beats; and the differences between lyrical content performed over the US songs and Cuban songs. Additionally, the distinct (Cuban) Spanish dialect used to deliver the lyrics contributes to the nationalistic value of Cuban hip hop, and is viewed as characteristic which sets it apart from other Spanish- speaking countries and the US alike. The lyrical content, in and of itself, also speaks to the struggles and hardships experienced by Cubans in impoverished inner city areas of Havana. The harsh Cuban reality, in this way, provides a lens into the unique inner-city experience of Cubans suffering from socio-economic hardships. According to Marc Ramirez, hip hop has acted as tool for youth in Cuba to speak out. Here, Ramirez pinpoints the importance of hip hop in Cuban culture‚Äîeven more so than other native musical styles: ‚ÄúIn Cuba, where teenagers and young adults see their world torn by social ills including street hustling and racism, there are worse things to worry about than power outages. And it's hip-hop - not salsa or rumba or the Buena Vista Social Club - that sustains the disillusioned‚Äù (Ramirez). Additionally, political and historical events are resonant in the music making, it a unique expression of Cuban culture. For instance, the group Instisto incorporates texts about the Afro-Cuban deity Obatala. Additionally, the rap duo An√≥nimo consejo frequently expresses their love for Cuba through their politically and socially conscious lyrics. At the same time that Cuban rappers have used the genre to speak out about the realities of their daily lives and issues that are often politely overlooked in Cuban culture, they also walk a fine line since so much of the hip hop scene is supported by the government. When the state and its nationalist perspective plays such a large role in the production and promotion of Cuban hip hop, artists must make careful decisions about how much criticism they really want to offer of the regime. When they rap about the realities of race or the sense that poverty and economic hardship are not being alleviated by the state, they risk breaking the close ties they have to the government and thus put their success on the line. Some groups have gone too far and faced sanctions or censorship \\"Cuban Hip Hop Reaches Crossroads\\" http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2004/10/04/entertainment/main647330.shtml However, many Cuban artists seem to have reached a consensus with the state's involvement in rap, accepting that the government's role may lead to better production, more support, and more commercial exposure. On the other hand, the government seems to accept and respect the revolutionary nature of hip hop and embrace that it is a means for the marginalized or downtrodden to speak up. In fact, many Cuban rap groups openly criticize the government, and many others openly assimilate to the government's nationalist ideals. The relationship can be characterized as encompassing both censorship and assimilationHip-hop and Reggaeton in Cuba In 1995 the first Festival de Rap Cubano was held in Alamar, a housing Project in East Havana. This event was initially set up as a contest for the dozens of emerging rap groups all over Cuba. One of the Festival's organizers Rodolfo Rensoli, a member of Grupo Uno, decided that the only way that hip hop would not be attacked in Cuba the same way Rock was to avoid the same political pitfalls. This even went on to help legitimize some of Cuba most prominent performing raps groups like Primera Base. The festival has grown to include some American stars such as Dead Prez and Blackstar. Erykah Badu, a U.S. singer and Grammy award winner and one of the best singers of the \\"un-soul style,\\" is among the biggest attractions of 2003's rap festival.http://www.afrocubaweb.com/rap/rapfestival8.htm Although rap Cubano clearly adopted many musical techniques and stylistics characterized by rap in the US, the artists do not take such an adversarial role against the Cuban government for several reasons. First, the state supports hip hop culture as a vehicle of progressive revolution which is openly accepted in the midst of a polarized socio-political shift from Communism to Market Capitalism. Secondly, young Havana artists realize that their government provides free health care and education, as well as a generally more equitable distribution of resources. In contrast to US rap, rap Cubano's economic, and socio-political support elucidates a stark discrepancy in the motivation and ethos of the genres. While the foundation of gansta rap is rooted in histories of state abandonment and discrimination, rap Cubano formulates a less polarized musical expression that lyrically portrays the realities of a new generation of Cuban artists searching for identity.Baker, Geoffrey. 2005. \\"¬°Hip hop, Revoluci√≥n! Nationalizing Rap in Cuba.\\" Ethnomusicology 49, no. 3: 368-402.  Cuban slang Yuma is a Cuban street slang word for foreigners in general. Originally this word meant ‚ÄúYankee‚Äù, a person from the United States.Fairley J; Cambridge University Press, 2006, volume 25/3.pp 447-488 Cubans use this word only for people from the U.S., but U.S. people are not the only visitors to Cuba. A song was made named \\"A ti te gustan los yumas.\\" There were a couple reasons why this song was made, including the thought that Cuban women prefer foreign men for money.Miller T.; Tucson weekly, 2001; ‚ÄúDreaming in Cuban‚Äù Recent events In 2002 the government formed the Agencia Cubana de Rap (Cuban Rap Agency) with its own record label and hip hop magazine to help promote the art form on the island. Weekly radio and TV shows were launched. With the creation of the Cuban Rap Agency by the Cuban government, this group encouraged and endorsed various rappers and created their albums. However, there was a down-side to this agency that affected the popularity of the CRA. Getting artists and bands radio time and fame, came at a slight price; there were limits as to how artists could express themselves. Thus, the CRA would only endorse groups that were willing to change their lyrics and music styles to those that were accepted by the government and community. As a result, not many groups or artists were willing to give into the CRA expectations. In a way, the CRA interfered with the originality and creativity of the artist. The CRA, seen as a threat to the hip hop community, silenced voices and the true messages of lyrics, inventive thoughts, and new ideals were never actually heard.The Tartan Online : Cuban Rap Agency pushes smart subcultural rap to the margins''' With official sanction and resources the Alamar Rap festival was transformed into an annual international hip hop festival held in August. The event has attracted many international artists including from the US amongst others, Mos Def, Talib Kweli, The Roots, Common and Dead Prez. Workshops, film screenings and talks are held in conjunction debating culture and lyrical content. It is estimated that there are some 500 hip hop groups in Cuba. However, whilst there has been much academic and media interest in Cuban hip hop, few Cuban groups have managed to be heard outside of the island. The first group to achieve international success were Los Orishas, who are now based in France. In 2002 the album Cuban Hip Hop Allstars, produced by Pablo Herrera, was released in the US featuring some of the best groups at that time. Another group to be released internationally via Italy is Clan 537 who found fame with \\"Quien Tiro La Tiza\\" (Who Threw the Chalk).

Reggaeton ‚Äìwhose lyrics emphasize Sensuality, Individualism and sex, in graphic and sexually explicit terms‚Äì stands in sharp contrast to the tradition of Cuban underground rap, the content of which is more often characterized by social commentary on inequality and injustice. Reggaeton versus Cuban rap has become a contentious debate in Cuba. It's driven many within the socially - conscious rap scene to paint reggaeton as the \\"enemy\\" due to its focus on mindless dancing rather than community reflection. Furthermore, critics of reggaeton condemn the genre as lyrically and musically deficient ( It is ironic however, that Engineering a Cuban Reggaeton song is drastically more complex in contrast to Cuban hip hop) and morally questionable as well as too commercially oriented.Baker, Geoffrey. 2008. ‚ÄúThe Politics of Dancing.‚Äù In Reading Reggaeton (forthcoming, Duke University Press).

However, women in hip hop in Cuba face a difficult dichotomoy of both acting as the powerful female or as the sexy perreo dancer. For example, Las Kudras, who describe themselves as feminists and do not participate in the nationalized Cuban hip hop scene, are comfortable questioning ‚Äúhegemonic notions of femininity and Black female sexuality‚Äù.Saunders, Tanya L. \\"La Lucha Mujerista: Krudas CUBENSI and Black Feminist Sexual Politics in Cuba\\" in CRGS Issue 3, 2009Armstead, Ronni. ‚ÄúGrowing the Size of the Black Woman:‚Äô Feminist Activism in Havana Hip Hop.‚Äù NWSA Journal [1040-0656] 2007. Vol:19, Issue 1, Pg 106 Yet, female rap groups such as Animo Consejo who have an interest in broader, national appeal have a more difficult time managing between their role as a sexy performer who will be judged by their onstage look and as rappers who are interested in changing the racialized role of women in Cuba.

It is notable as the northernmost point of Wales. The island measures a maximum of 207 metres by 110 metres, with a maximum area of 3.7 acres and has a maximum altitude of 16 metres above sea level. It is one of a chain of three islands off the north of Anglesey, the others being Ynys Amlwch and Maen y Bugail. Local legend has it that St Patrick was shipwrecked there, giving rise to its Welsh name. He then swam ashore and eventually founded the nearby church of Llanbadrig in about 440 AD, believed to be the oldest Christian site in Wales. Middle Mouse is a favoured place for cormorants, guillemots and razorbills. For visiting scuba divers the attractions are steep underwater cliffs that drop away to 40 metres with abundant marine life. There is very little protection from the fierce tidal flow, so accurate timing for slack water is required. During the 19th century the island was used as a navigational aid to ships sailing into Liverpool. Any vessel that passed the island without signalling, and waiting for, a pilot was liable to incur a fine. The S.S. Liverpool, following a collision with a ship named Laplata, was shipwrecked near Middle Mouse in 1863. She had on board a shipment of tin ingots. In 2005, the island was put up for sale as part of a estate.

Point of Ayr () is the northernmost point of mainland Wales. It is situated immediately to the north of Talacre in Flintshire, at the mouth of the Dee estuary. It is to the southwest of the Liverpool Bay area of the Irish Sea. It is the site of a RSPB (Royal Society for the Protection of Birds) nature reserve RSPB Dee Estuary Point of Ayr, and is part of Gronant and Talacre Dunes Site of Special Scientific Interest. Coal For many years a colliery operated at Point of Ayr at the northern extremity of the Flintshire Coalfield; it was one of the last remaining operational deep mines in Wales. The first trial borings took place in 1865, under the direction of Lord Mostyn, owner of Mostyn Colliery, a few miles away. The borings seemed successful, and the Prestatyn Coal Company was formed to commence operations proper, however the project was abandoned before it got off the ground. In 1873, the site was investigated a second time, by a newly formed company, the Western Mostyn Colliery Company, however the trial shaft was not successful, and the project was again abandoned. In 1883, a third company was formed, the Point of Ayr Colliery Company, and in 1890 they struck a seam. Coal at this time was brought to the surface by a team of 75 pit ponies. A second shaft was also sunk around this time. According to the Inspector of Mines records, in 1896 the pit employed 356 men producing coal for domestic and industrial uses. A third shaft was sunk sometime after the National Coal Board took over the site following nationalisation in 1947. The coal field extended northwards under the Irish Sea. Six men have been killed during the sink of a new shaft on the 4th of July 1952. By 1953, 738 men were producing 213,000 tons of coal annually. Point of Ayr colliery closed on 23 August 1996. Nothing now remains of the colliery. However, like many former coal mines, the name is retained by \\"Point of Ayr Colliery Band\\", a Brass Band competing at Championship level. The site was chosen in the early eighties for a demonstration \\"Oil from Coal\\" plant jointly funded by the government, the National Coal Board and others. Bench scale trials was carried out on site but the project became a victim of the miners strike and the subsequent cut back in research funding for this and clean burn technology. The plant never became operational and was scrapped. Gas Point of Ayr is also the place where natural gas from the Celtic gas- fields comes ashore. Gas is piped through a pipeline 33.5 km long from the Douglas Complex of gas and petroleum drilling platforms in the Irish Sea. The Point of Ayr gas terminal has a gas processing capacity of per day at standard conditions. The facilities remove methanol (used for hydrate inhibition), water and condensate. The gas is sweetened with an amine solvent to remove sulphur compounds to below 3.3 ppm and chilled to reduce the hydrocarbon dewpoint. The processing plant was originally part of the BHP Billiton development of the Liverpool Bay area, but now owned and operated by Eni.http://www.dailypost.co.uk/business/business-news/point-ayr-terminal-oil- gas-6904263 Gas is transported through a 27-km underground pipeline at 30 bar along the North Wales coast to Connah's Quay. After further processing, the gas is sold to Uniper, for their combined cycle gas turbine power station at Connah's Quay, on Deeside, in Flintshire. Lighthouse Point of Ayr also gives its name to a lighthouse, built in 1776, though inactive since 1883. It stands on Talacre beach, at the entrance to the River Dee estuary. The lighthouse once displayed two lights. The main beam, at 63 feet, shone seaward towards Llandudno. A secondary beam shone up the River Dee, towards the hamlet of Dawpool, in Cheshire, on the English side of the estuary. Whilst in service, the lighthouse was painted with red and white stripes, and had a red lantern housing. It was replaced in 1844 with a metal pile lighthouse, bearing a white light, put up by order of the Corporation of Trinity House. This new structure was itself replaced in 1883 with a lightship.

While traditional surround sound systems can only recreate the original 3D sound in a small \\"sweet spot\\", Iosono claims it can recreate the original audio in the whole room. In 2014, Iosono was acquired by Barco.

The group, which debuted in Justice League of America #43 (March 1966), use a playing card theme. Their code names are based on an ace-high straight in poker: Ace, King, Queen, Jack, and Ten. The group returned to battle the Justice League of America many times, and also appeared in other comics, including Wonder Woman , Formerly Known as the Justice League and Superman. The group has been described as \\"some of the most original villains of their time.\\" The gang has also appeared in many animated television adaptations, including The Super Powers Team: Galactic Guardians in 1985, Batman Beyond in 1999 and 2000, Justice League in 2003 and 2005, and Batman: The Brave and the Bold in 2009 and 2010. The Royal Flush Gang also made appearances in the live-action Arrowverse TV shows airing on the CW, renamed the Reston crime family. They debuted in the first season of Arrow in 2012, and also appeared in the first season of The Flash in 2015. The comic book versions seen in the 2013 Forever Evil storyline were redesigned to follow the pattern set by their Arrow appearance. Publication history The Royal Flush Gang first appeared in Justice League of America #43 in March 1966 under the leadership of Professor Amos Fortune and were created by Gardner Fox and Mike Sekowsky. Fictional team history =First Gang: Clubs= The first Royal Flush Gang, Mike Sekowsky The original Royal Flush Gang was Professor Amos Fortune's childhood gang. With Fortune himself as Ace, they fought the Justice League on two occasions, using Fortune's luck-altering \\"stellaration\\" technology to realize the fortune-telling significance of playing cards. After Fortune abandoned the Gang, a new Ace became the leader and they attempted to steal four paintings containing clues to a hidden treasure, but were thwarted by the Joker's manipulations.Joker #5. DC Comics. Most of them then abandoned their criminal careers, although Jack briefly joined the Secret Society of Super Villains as \\"Hi-Jack\\". Fortune's gang wore costumes based on the suit of clubs, but when they fought the Joker, the second Ace convinced them to change them to the suit of spades. In the pages of JLA Classified, it was revealed the original Royal Flush Gang (sans Amos Fortune) reunited to fight the \\"Detroit Era\\" Justice League and their successors in the second gang. In this battle, the original King, Queen and Ten were all killed. =Second Gang: Spades= The second Royal Flush Gang was set up by Green Lantern villain Hector Hammond in Justice League of America #203. Hammond led the group as \\"Wildcard\\". This version wore costumes based on the suit of spades. The gang split up and went on to have separate criminal careers before re-establishing themselves, without Hammond. They were twice hired by Maxwell Lord as part of his manipulation of Justice League International. Later, they were reorganized and reoutfitted by a successor to the Golden Age Green Lantern villain the Gambler masquerading as the Joker.Justice League of America #203. DC Comics. The membership of this group consists of: ;King (Joe Carny): The so-called \\"King of the Hoboes\\", Carny also suffered from lung disease. As Hammond's agent, he wore a costume that technologically enhanced his natural charisma to the point of mind control. Following the metagene bomb in Invasion!, King became immortal. Although King is the highest-ranking member of the gang, in poker the Ace ranks as the highest card in a royal flush. ;Queen (Mona Taylor): Taylor was originally a Broadway star whose career was destroyed by her ongoing alcoholism. As Hammond's agent, she wielded a sceptre that cast realistic illusions. After the Gambler reoutfitted the team, she began employing a wrist shooter that fires razor sharp spades. ;Jack (name unknown): Originally a gigolo, he became a fugitive after inadvertently killing a client while attempting to steal her jewelry. As Hammond's agent, he wielded an energy-charged sword. The Gambler replaced his left eye with a cybernetically- activated laser weapon, making him a literal \\"one-eyed Jack\\". The removal of his eye to implant the laser initially impacted his sanity. ;Ten (Wanda Wayland): Wayland was a test pilot fired for refusing her employer's sexual advances. As Hammond's agent, she wore a costume with energy blasters in its gloves. She has enhanced reflexes, and carries explosive playing cards. ;Ace: The first Ace (\\"Derek Reston\\") was a superstrong android in the form of an African-American man. A second Ace (Ernie Clay) was recruited by King and used a strength-enhancing exoskeleton provided by the Gambler. In more recent appearances in Starman and Infinite Crisis, however, the team was once again employing the robot Ace. King, Queen and Ten also have blaster-pistols. The Gang fly on hovering playing cards. In the Gang's appearances in Teen Titans, Ten had organized runaways as \\"Ten's Little Indians\\", a gang of thieves dressed as the two through nine of spades and armed with bows and trick arrows. =Third Gang: All Suits= Superman: The Man of Steel #121 revealed that the Royal Flush Gang had expanded. The Royal Flush Gang is now an organization that reaches across America, with cells in every major city. Instead of five members, each \\"cell\\" has fifty-two, split into four suits run by the \\"court cards\\". Each member has a playing card value, and those who rise or fall in the Gang's esteem gain or lose a \\"pip\\".Superman: The Man of Steel #121. DC Comics. Notably, Stargirl's father Sam Kurtis was a \\"Two of Clubs\\"; upon defeating him, she transitioned from the Star-Spangled Kid identity to Stargirl in JSA: All-Stars.Stars and S.T.R.I.P.E. #10. DC Comics. Recently, in Infinite Crisis #2, the Joker tortures and kills the leadership of a local cell of the Royal Flush Gang from an unspecified city, after being rejected by the Society for his \\"instability\\". The King is the last one left alive and he mocks the Joker for being rejected. He kills the King with an electrical blast to the face. The dead gang is left in the ruins of a casino. However, given the fact that King is immortal, to the point that he has recovered from death almost instantly on numerous occasions, it seems improbable that he actually permanently died.Infinite Crisis #2. DC Comics. Another cell of the expanded version, this one stylized as a street gang, appear as members of the Society in Villains United and several of its tie-ins in other comics. It is unclear what ties the third gang has or had‚Äîif any‚Äîto its predecessors and successors. =Post-Crisis Gang= A new version of the Royal Flush Gang appears in Justice League of America (volume 2) #35. This version is working under the authority of Amos Fortune, who is addressed by other members as \\"Wild Card\\". In the following issue, Fortune gives a history of the gang. It seems to combine the first and third gangs' histories/characteristics, with Fortune indicating that he was always running the group in some capacity.Justice League of America Vol. 2 #35. DC Comics. Currently, there are multiple active, costumed members, some of whom are deriving their outfits and codenames from cards with pip values lower than ten. Members can rise in the numerical ranks as reward for their successes, or be \\"dealt out\\" at the discretion of Wild Card. It is unclear if there are still 52 cells throughout the country, or 52 members in total. A lower ranked member mentions that there are four Queens, but Fortune states that the group is constantly growing. A branch of the Royal Flush Gang based in Las Vegas, Nevada recently appeared in Zatanna # 4. Rather than using a playing card motif, each member of the Vegas branch is modeled after a member of the Rat Pack (such as Frank Sinatra, Sammy Davis Jr. and Dean Martin).Zatanna #4. DC Comics. =The New 52= In \\"The New 52\\" (a 2011 reboot of the DC Comics universe), the Royal Flush Gang appears in the \\"Forever Evil\\" storyline. They appear as members of the Secret Society of Super Villains at the time when the Crime Syndicate arrive from their world.Forever Evil #1. DC Comics. While Heat Wave sacrifices himself so that the other Rogues can get away from Black Mask, Clayface, and Mr. Freeze, the remaining Rogues are confronted by the Royal Flush Gang who orders them to surrender if they don't want Golden Glider to die.Forever Evil: Rogues Rebellion #4.DC Comics. =DC Rebirth= In the DC Rebirth initiative, the Royal Flush Gang have their design from Batman Beyond, including traveling on a flying playing card. They are among the many villains aiming to kill Batman in order to stop Two-Face from revealing information. They descend on KGBeast and ask him the location of Batman and Duke Thomas. KGBeast throws a bomb onto the bottom of their playing card, presumably to take out his rivals in stopping Batman.All-Star Batman #3. DC Comics. Other versions =Elseworlds= In the miniseries Kingdom Come by Mark Waid and Alex Ross, King is a member of Lex Luthor's Mankind Liberation Front. He apparently has gone separate from the Gang, but carries a cigarette pack with playing card markings and speaks in metaphors drawn from card games. There is also a man in the Justice League's prison who appears to be a new version of the Ace of Spades. According to the Elliot S! Maggin novelization, King is also newly immortal, and Vandal Savage's protege. =JLA/Avengers= In the crossover series JLA/Avengers, the group appears as lackeys of Krona who attack Green Arrow and Hawkeye. King is shown being defeated by Jack of Hearts. In other media =Television= * The Royal Flush Gang appears in The Super Powers Team: Galactic Guardians with King voiced by Eugene Williams, Queen voiced by Arlene Golonka, Jack voiced by Jerry Houser, and Ten voiced by Lynne Moody. In the 1985 episode \\"The Wild Cards\\", they are a quartet of thieves recruited by the mysterious Ace (not an android). In league with Darkseid, Ace is revealed to be the Joker in disguise as deduced by Batman upon realizing that the Royal Flush Gang's house of cards was missing his namesake card. It is also revealed that the house of cards disguises a dimensional warp from Earth to Apokolips. By the end of the episode, Ten (feeling in over her head) switches sides and the rest of the gang and Joker are captured. * A futuristic incarnation of the Royal Flush Gang appear in three episodes of Batman Beyond titled \\"Dead Man's Hand\\" (1999), \\"Once Burned\\" (1999), and \\"King's Ransom\\" (2000). They use various high-tech weapons with a playing card theme per their name: King (voiced by George Lazenby), Queen (voiced by Amanda Donohoe in season one and by Sarah Douglas in subsequent appearances), their son Jack (voiced by Scott Cleverdon in season one and by Nicholas Guest in Season 3), their daughter Melanie Walker (voiced by Olivia d'Abo) takes the role of Ten, and Ace is an android. They are a family of criminals that has existed for generations (Through Queen's line of the family as established in the episode King's Ransom) that now has encounters with the new Batman (Terry McGinnis). In the episode \\"Dead Man's Hand\\", King reveals that when he was younger, the family was briefly broken up and humiliated by the original Batman, and now seeks revenge. Terry and Melanie also develop a romantic interest. In the episode \\"Once Burned\\", Melanie's loyalty is tested by King and Queen, motivating Melanie to leave the gang. In the episode \\"King's Ransom\\", the gang is barely scraping by without Ten, and resort to holding their employer Paxton Powers for ransom, though Paxton is able to talk them into a new deal: assassinate Bruce Wayne, giving Paxton full control over Wayne Enterprises in exchange for a piece from Paxton's rare art collection worth twice the ransom. But thanks to Batman's intervention, the gang is thwarted, Ace is destroyed and King is revealed to have been having an affair with Sable Thorpe (Paxton Powers's secretary) as he was fed up with living in the shadow of his predecessor (King's late father-in-law and Queen's father). The family is arrested but Jack is bailed out by Melanie and takes an honest job at the same restaurant where she works. * Two different incarnations appeared in Justice League and Justice League Unlimited. ** The first and most important incarnation debuted in the two-part Justice League episode \\"Wild Cards\\", featured as a group of government-trained teenagers found and given their theme by the Joker (playing on the fact that his name is also a card in a deck). It's possible this iteration was also an homage to Marvel's Fantastic Four, with powers resembling those of the four primary members plus Franklin Richards: King can create fire blasts with pyrokinesis, Queen can manipulate metal with ferrokinesis, Jack has complete body elasticity, Ten has invulnerability and super strength comparable to that of Superman, and Ace has telepathy and is able to create illusions that drive people insane just by looking at them even through video broadcasts. The voice actors and actresses of the Royal Flush Gang were also those for the five main characters of Teen Titans: King is voiced by Scott Menville, who also voiced Robin; Queen is voiced by Tara Strong, who also voiced Raven; Jack is voiced by Greg Cipes, who also voiced Beast Boy; Ten is voiced by Khary Payton, who also voiced Cyborg; and Ace is voiced by Hynden Walch, who also voiced Starfire. Joker uses his gang to stage a reality show in Las Vegas to serve as muscle while the Justice League searches the city for explosives. While King, Ten and Jack are eventually captured, Queen was knocked out during a fight with the Green Lantern and Hawkgirl then was subdued when one of the bombs inside detonated. The bombs are revealed to be a hoax, the point of which was to draw viewership so that Joker could use Ace to drive millions of people insane. The plan fails when Batman pulls a collar from Joker's jacket which Ace's government handlers had used to control her as a child and which Joker had kept as insurance against her. Realizing that Joker was simply using her, Ace gets so angry that she turns her powers on Joker to drive the Clown Prince of Crime into catatonia for a time; she then departs the scene and disappears. Former General Hardcastle reveals in the episode \\"Fearful Symmetry\\" to Supergirl, Green Arrow and the Question that this incarnation was part of Project Cadmus. ** Walch reprises her role in a flashback in the Justice League Unlimited episode \\"Epilogue\\". When a lonely and depressed Ace's powers evolved to the point where she could warp reality, she made a second incarnation of the Royal Flush Gang out of four random people in an attempt to make friends, but they ditched her and use their powers for crime. All of the new members were various puns based partially on their names: King was a massive head with small limbs that flew on a throne and fired beams from his eyes (visually an homage to Marvel villain M.O.D.O.K. and Egg Fu); Queen was a large man, given the appearance of a woman, with enhanced strength; Jack was a samurai; and Ten was a woman with long, extensible cornrows she could use like a whip. As the Justice League battled the empowered criminals, Amanda Waller‚Äîa faculty member of Project Cadmus‚Äîrevealed that Ace was dying due to an aneurysm and a possible psychic backlash caused by her death could kill millions; Batman volunteered to use a device to kill her before that could happen, confronting her in a local park. She didn't attack him, however, as she knew he wouldn't actually use the device at all; so she briefly explained her backstory to him and then asked him to stay by her side until she died. Batman accepted her request, allowing her to pass away peacefully without harming anyone; Ace's warped reality and empowered criminals returned to normal upon her death. * The Royal Flush Gang appears in Batman: The Brave and the Bold. This version is a gang of bandits in the Old West with the diamond insignia on their outfits: Ace (voiced by Diedrich Bader) is the leader, Jack (voiced by Edoardo Ballerini) speaks Spanish, King and Queen are present but there is no evidence of Ten. In the 2009 episode \\"Return of the Fearsome Fangs\\", Jonah Hex is caught by the gang. As they plan to tear Hex apart with scattering horses, Batman frees Hex and the two apprehend the Royal Flush Gang. In the 2010 episode \\"The Siege of Starro\\" (Pt. 1), they are featured attempting to rob a bank but are stopped by Hex and Cinnamon. * The Royal Flush Gang appears in the TV shows set in the Arrowverse: ** The Royal Flush Gang appears in the live-action series Arrow, where King is portrayed by Currie Graham, Ace is portrayed by Kyle Schmid, Jack is portrayed by Tom Stevens and Queen is portrayed by Sarah-Jane Redmond. There is no evidence of Ten in this version. In the 2012 episode \\"Legacies\\", the gang is a family of bank robbers who wear hockey masks with their respective playing card. It is later revealed that the leader Derek Reston worked for Queen Industries before Robert Queen outsourced 1500 jobs to China and the Reston family lost their home as a result. Feeling guilty, Oliver Queen tries to persuade Derek to right his own wrongs, but when he learns that the family are going to rob another bank, he chooses to stop them. During Oliver Queen's confrontation, Derek is shot and killed, while Ace and the rest of the family are arrested. During Derek's final moments, Oliver sits with him and reveals his secret identity to him to show him that he always had his best interests at heart. Derek admits that what he did was wrong and shouldn't have dragged his sons into this. He then asks Oliver if his son is alright. Oliver tells him he's just knocked out. Derek then closes his eyes and dies in Oliver's arms. ** The second Royal Flush Gang appears briefly in the live- action series The Flash as three motorcycle thieves with specific helmets. In the 2015 episode \\"The Sound and the Fury\\", the masked Royal Flush Gang members were swiftly apprehended by Barry Allen. Its listed members are \\"King\\", \\"Queen\\" and \\"Ace\\". * Sam Kurtis of the comics' third incarnation of the group appears in the DC Universe / The CW series Stargirl, portrayed by Geoff Stults. After disappearing in the pilot episode, he turns up in the episode \\"Shining Knight\\", ostensibly to reconnect with Courtney, though he was really after her locket so he could sell it off for money. However, her stepfather Pat Dugan realizes Kurtis' true intentions and confronts him; telling him to never return. =Film= * The Royal Flush Gang appears in Justice League: Doom with King voiced by Jim Meskimen, Queen voiced by Grey DeLisle, Jack voiced by Robin Atkin Downes, Ten voiced by Juliet Landau, and the robotic Ace voiced by Bruce Timm. This incarnation is a spades incarnation. They have similar or changed abilities from the original. King uses a scepter with the ability to electrocute targets at point blank range; he uses this against Martian Manhunter although it causes no permanent damage. His mind control and immortality is nowhere to be seen. Queen's wrist shooter and scepter are nowhere to be seen, replaced by simply throwing cards with incredible accuracy and speed (akin to Gambit) with enough strength to cut through even Batman's grappling lines. Jack's laser eye, Ace's android construction and Ten's energy blasts have not been changed, although Ten's explosive playing cards are not seen. Their hovering playing cards for transport have not been changed either. None of the members are given names. They attempt to rob a bank using a dimensional phasing technology that allows them to walk through walls but are halted by the arrival of Batman tipped off by Cyborg about their robberies. They manage to overcome Batman, but the remainder of the Justice League arrive and they quickly begin to fall: Queen is overpowered by Wonder Woman, Ten is taken out by the Green Lantern, Jack is captured by Batman and the Flash, Ace is destroyed by Superman, and King is defeated by Cyborg. Even with Wonder Woman's magic lasso and Martian Manhunter's mind-reading abilities, they couldn't find out who supplied the technology to them as the gang didn't know themselves. It is discovered that the tech was secretly supplied by Vandal Savage as a means to test it for his own plans, and the battle itself may have been simply a means for Mirror Master to infiltrate the Batcave. =Video Games= * The Royal Flush Gang is alluded in Batman: Arkham City and Batman: Arkham Knight as a club named after the group is seen. =Miscellaneous= * Royal Flush Gang makes an appearance in issue #02 of the comic book tie-in of Justice League Unlimited. * The Royal Flush Gang appears in issue 6 of the Batman: The Brave and the Bold comics. * Ace from the Royal Flush Gang appears in issue 23 of the tie-in Arrow comic book series.

During this time he wrote short stories, some of which, such as \\"And the Birds Hummed Dirges,\\" later appeared in Crazy Magazine during his stint as editor. In early 1972, Gerber asked Thomas, by this time Marvel editor-in-chief, about writing comics; Thomas sent him a writer's test ‚Äì six pages of a Daredevil car-chase scene drawn by Gene Colan ‚Äì which Gerber passed. He accepted a position as an associate editor and writer at Marvel Comics. Thomas said in 2007, Gerber's comics writing career at Marvel began with three comic books cover-dated December 1972: Adventure into Fear #11, The Incredible Hulk #158, and a collaboration with writer Carole Seuling on Shanna the She-Devil. Gerber initially penned superhero stories for titles such as Daredevil (20 issues), Iron Man (three issues) and Sub-Mariner (11 issues). Gerber penned anthological horror-fantasy stories for Creatures on the Loose (adaptations of Lin Carter's Thongor), Monsters Unleashed, Chamber of Chills and Journey into Mystery and humor pieces for Crazy Magazine, becoming editor of that satirical magazine for issues #11‚Äì14. The Man-Thing and Howard the Duck Gerber scripted one of his signature series, Man-Thing, about a swamp-monster empath, beginning in Adventure into Fear #11 (Dec. 1972). On page 11 of that issue, he created the series' narrative tagline, used in captions: \\"Whatever knows fear burns at the Man- Thing's touch!\\" After issue #19 (Dec. 1973), Man-Thing received a solo title, which ran 22 issues (Jan. 1974 ‚Äì Oct. 1975). Gerber and Mayerik introduced the original Foolkiller in issue #3 (March 1974).Sanderson \\"1970s\\" in Gilbert (2008), p. 165: \\"Writer Steve Gerber made his own comment on the rise of 'grim and gritty' vigilantes when he and artist Val Mayerik created the Foolkiller in Man-Thing #3.\\" In the final issue, Gerber appeared as a character in the story, claiming he had not been inventing the Man-Thing's adventures but simply reporting on them and that he had decided to move on. With penciler Val Mayerik, Gerber created Howard the Duck as a secondary character in a Man- Thing story in Adventure into Fear #19 (Dec. 1973).Sanderson \\"1970s\\" in Gilbert (2008), p. 161: \\"December [1973] saw the debut of the cigar-smoking Howard the Duck. In this story by writer Steve Gerber and artist Val Mayerik, various beings from different realities had begun turning up in the Man- Thing's Florida swamp, including this bad-tempered talking duck.\\" Howard graduated to his own backup feature in Giant-Size Man-Thing, confronting such bizarre horror-parody characters as Garko the Man-Frog and Bessie the Hellcow, before acquiring his own comic-book title with Howard the Duck #1 in January 1976.Sanderson \\"1970s\\" in Gilbert (2008), p. 174: \\"Gerber and artist Frank Brunner quickly brought Howard back...in his own comic book.\\" Gerber wrote 27 issues of the series, penciled initially by Frank Brunner and shortly afterward by Gene Colan. The series gradually developed a substantial cult following, which Marvel helped to promote by Howard's satiric entry into the 1976 U.S. presidential campaign under the auspices of the All-Night Party. Marvel attempted a spin-off with a short-lived Howard the Duck syndicated comic strip from 1977 to 1978, initially scripted by Gerber and drawn by Colan and Mayerik, then later, much to Gerber's dismay, written by another experienced comic book writer, Marv Wolfman, and drawn by Alan Kupperberg. Gerber had been replaced on the strip in mid-1978, creating acrimony and a lawsuit. Marvel's then editor-in-chief, Jim Shooter, blamed Gerber's chronic tardiness, saying the creative team was \\"producing strips within six days of their publication dates,\\" which he said caused several newspapers to drop the strip. Shooter added that while the syndicate threatened to drop the strip if a new writer were not brought in, \\"Steve can tell you a good number of horror stories ‚Äì and they're all true ‚Äì about the trouble we had getting artists.\\" Gerber recalled, in the 2000s, that: =Other comics work= Gerber often collaborated with writer Mary Skrenes during this period. Among other Marvel projects, Gerber created Omega the Unknown with Skrenes and artist Jim Mooney, which explored the strange link between a cosmic superhero and a boy, and wrote the first issue of Marvel Comics Super Special featuring the rock band KISS. He created the characters of Starhawk,Sanderson \\"1970s\\" in Gilbert (2008), p. 170 Aleta Ogord and Nikki. He scripted the adventures of Daimon Hellstrom (son of Satan), Morbius, the Living Vampire and Dracula's daughter Lilith. Gerber often revived forgotten characters. In The Defenders, he revived three pre-superhero characters, the Headmen. He reintroduced the 1969 one-time feature Guardians of the Galaxy, first as guest stars in Marvel Two- in-One and The Defenders, then as a feature in Marvel Presents.Sanderson \\"1970s\\" in Gilbert (2008), p. 175: \\"The Guardians of the Galaxy finally received their own ongoing series in Marvel Presents #3, written by Steve Gerber and penciled by Al Milgrom.\\" Toward the end of his work at Marvel, he wrote Hanna-Barbera stories for Mark Evanier under the joint anagrammatic pseudonym Reg Everbest. Only two of these, featuring Magilla Gorilla and the Clue Club, were published in English. Battle for Howard the Duck In the first half of 1978, Gerber was fired from first the newspaper strip and then the comic book series for a failure to meet deadlines. On August 29, 1980, after learning of Marvel's efforts to license Howard for use in film and broadcast media, Gerber filed a copyright infringement lawsuit against Marvel corporate parent Cadence Industries and other parties, alleging that he was the sole owner of the character. DC work During the mid-1970s and early 1980s, Gerber worked for DC Comics, including an issue of Metal Men, the last three issues of Mister Miracle, The Phantom Zone limited series, and a run of \\"Doctor Fate\\" backup stories in The Flash co-written with Martin Pasko. Gerber had planned to write for DC's Time Warp science fiction anthology series, but objected to the submission guidelines for that series. Gerber wrote for independent comic companies. One of Gerber's first major works away from Marvel was the original graphic novel Stewart the Rat for Eclipse Comics, with art by Gene Colan and Tom Palmer. For Eclipse Magazine, Gerber and Mayerik created the anti-censorship horror story, \\"Role Model/Caring, Sharing, and Helping Others\\". Resolution of the court case In 1981 he teamed with Jack Kirby at Eclipse to create Destroyer Duck, a satirical comic created to raise funds for his court case against Marvel. The lawsuit was settled on September 24, 1982. Gerber acknowledged that his work on the character had been done as work-for-hire and that Marvel parent Cadence Industries owned \\"all right, title and interest\\" to Howard the Duck and related material. he On November 5, 1982, Judge David Kenyon approved the motion and dismissed the case. 1980s and 1990s career In the early 1980s, Gerber and Frank Miller made a joint proposal to revamp DC's three biggest characters, namely Superman, Batman and Wonder Woman;. The proposal was not accepted. After Marvel had cancelled his contract in May 1978,Steve Gerber: Conversations he returned to Marvel in 1983 with the short-lived Void Indigo. Gerber was slated to write a new Spectre series in 1986, but he missed the deadline for the first issue so that he could watch the last day of shooting on the Howard the Duck film and DC assigned another writer to the series in response. Gerber scripted assorted projects for Marvel, including the controversial creator- owned book Void Indigo (1984) for Epic Comics, a serialized, eight-page Man- Thing feature in the anthology series Marvel Comics Presents(Sept. 1988‚ÄìFeb. 1989), The Legion of Night and the 1991 Suburban Jersey Ninja She-Devils one- shot. For DC, he works includes A. Bizarro. At Marvel, Gerber scripted a 12-issue run on The Sensational She-Hulk (which featured Howard the Duck). He also scripted three issues of Cloak and Dagger, a Hawkeye story in Avengers Spotlight, and two issues of Toxic Crusaders. During this time he did a serial in Marvel Comics Presents featuring Poison, a character he had created in \\"The Evolutionary War\\" crossover. He scripted a A Nightmare on Elm Street magazine format comic book which detailed the backstory of the character of Freddy Krueger. Television work In collaboration with Beth Woods (later Slick), Gerber wrote the \\"Contagion\\" episode of the syndicated television series Star Trek: The Next Generation. Gerber's work television animation included story editor duties on The Transformers, G.I. Joe and Dungeons & Dragons; created Thundarr the Barbarian; and shared a 1998 Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Special Class ‚Äì Animated Program, for the WB program The New Batman/Superman Adventures.

For Image Comics, he co-created The Cybernary with Nick Manabat and disbanded Codename: Strykeforce, in addition to guest-writing Pitt. 2000s work In 2002, he created a new Howard the Duck miniseries for Marvel's MAX line. For DC, he created Nevada for the Vertigo imprint in 1998 with artist Phil Winslade and Hard Time with long-time collaborator Mary Skrenes, which outlasted the short-lived imprint DC Focus, but slow sales led Hard Time: Season Two to be cancelled after only seven issues. Later, Gerber wrote the Helmet of Fate: Zauriel one-shot and continued writing the Doctor Fate serial in the Countdown to Mystery limited series for DC Comics up to the time of his death, working on stories in the hospital. Gerber died before being able to write the concluding chapter of the serial; in his honor, four separate writers (Adam Beechen, Mark Evanier, Gail Simone, and Mark Waid) provided their own conclusions to the story. In 2010, Comics Bulletin ranked Gerber's run on The Defenders first on its list of the \\"Top 10 1970s Marvels\\", while Omega the Unknown was 10th on the same list. Gerber's posthumous Man-Thing story \\"The Screenplay of the Living Dead Man\\", with art by Kevin Nowlan, originally planned as a 1980s graphic novel before being left uncompleted by the artist, was revived in the 2010s and appeared as a three-issue miniseries cover-titled The Infernal Man-Thing (early Sept.-Oct. 2012).Infernal Man-Thing at the Grand Comics Database The story was a sequel to Gerber's \\"Song-Cry of the Living Dead Man\\" in Man-Thing #12 (Dec. 1974). =Death= In 2007, Gerber was diagnosed with an early stage of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, and was eventually hospitalized while continuing to work. He had gotten onto the waiting list for a lung transplant at UCLA Medical Center. On February 10, 2008, Gerber died in a Las Vegas hospital from complications stemming from his condition. His final comics work was writing Countdown to Mystery: Doctor Fate for DC Comics, having briefly worked with a version of the character in 1982. At the time of his death, Gerber was separated from his wife, Margo Macleod. He had a daughter, Samantha Gerber. In fiction One of Gerber's working pen-names, Reg Everbest, was the inspiration behind the first Foolkiller's real name which was revealed as Ross G. Everbest. Gerber used the anagrammatic Reg Everbest pseudonym for Marvel-published Hanna-Barbera stories after he was banned from Marvel by Jim Shooter. Roger Stern named the original, deceased Foolkiller \\"Ross G. Everbest\\" in The Amazing Spider-Man #225, in homage to Gerber, using Gerber's middle name as the character's first name, the middle initial restoring the anagram save for a silent e. The character's real name never appeared in the two Gerber stories, but is seen on a computer screen in the second Foolkiller's van, next to the face of the original user of that identity.

He was born in Nuremberg and died in Frankfurt am Main.  Biography  Hassler was born in Nuremberg and baptized on 26 October 1564, receiving his first instruction in music from his father, the organist Isaak Hassler.Grove 2000 p.119. In 1584, Hassler became the first of many German composers of the time who went to Italy to continue their studies; he arrived in Venice during the peak of activity of the Venetian school, the composers who wrote in the resplendent polychoral style, which was soon to become popular outside its native city. Hassler was already familiar with some of this music, as numerous prints had circulated in Germany due to the interest of Leonhard Lechner, who was associated with Orlandus Lassus in Munich. While in Venice, Hassler became friends with Giovanni Gabrieli, with whom he composed a wedding motet for Georg Gruber, a Nuremberg merchant living in Venice, in 1600. Together they studied with Andrea Gabrieli, Giovanni's uncle. Under Andrea, Hassler received instruction in composition and organ playing.Grove 2000, p.120. Following Andrea Gabrieli's death, Hassler returned to Germany in the latter part of 1585, moving to Augsburg where he served as an organist to Octavian II Fugger, a nobleman there. The Augsburg years were extremely creative for him; in addition he became well known as a composer and organist at this time, though his influence was limited because he was a Protestant in an area which was still heavily Catholic. Hassler was not only a composer, but also an active organist and a consultant to organ builders. In 1596, Hassler, along with 53 other organists, was given the opportunity to examine a new instrument with 59 stops at the Schlosskirche, Groningen. Hassler was continually recognized for his expertise in organ design, and was often called upon as the examiner of new instruments. Using his extensive organ background, Hassler stepped into the world of mechanical instrument construction and developed a clockwork organ that was later sold to Emperor Rudolf II. In 1602, Hassler returned to Nuremberg where he became the Kapellmeister, or director of town music. While there, he was appointed Kaiserlicher Hofdiener in the court of Rudolf II. In 1604, he took a leave of absence and traveled to Ulm, where he was wed to Cordula Claus. Four years later, Hassler moved to Dresden where he served as the electoral chamber organist to the Elector Christian II of Saxony, and eventually as Kapellmeister. By this time, Hassler had already developed the tuberculosis that would claim his life in June 1612. After he died, Michael Praetorius and Heinrich Sch√ºtz were appointed in his place.  Style  Hassler was one of the first to bring the innovations of the Venetian style across the Alps. Through his songs, ‚Äúin the manner of foreign madrigal and canzonets,‚Äù and the Lustgarten, Hassler brought to Germany the villanelle, canzonette, and dance songs of Gastoldi and Orazio Vecchi. As the first great German composer to undertake an ‚ÄúItalian Journey,‚Äù Hassler's influence was one of the reasons for the Italian domination over German music and for the common trend of German musicians finishing their education in Italy.Bukofzer 1947, p.83. While musicians of the stature of Lassus had been working in Germany for years, they represented the older school, the prima pratica, the fully developed and refined Renaissance style of polyphony; in Italy new trends were emerging which were to define what was later called the Baroque era. Musicians such as Hassler, and later Sch√ºtz, carried the concertato style, the polychoral idea, and the freely emotional expression of the Venetians into the German culture, creating the first and most important Baroque development outside of Italy. Though Hassler was Protestant, he wrote many masses and directed the music for Catholic services in Augsburg.Reese 1959, p.687. While in the service of Octavian Fugger, Hassler dedicated both his Cantiones sacrae and a book of masses for four to eight voices to him. Due to the demands of the Catholic patrons, and his own Protestant beliefs, Hassler's compositions represented a skillful blend of both religions‚Äô music styles that allowed his compositions to function in both contexts.Fisher 2004, p.158. Thus, many of Hassler's works could be used both in the Roman Catholic Church and the Lutheran. During his time in Augsburg, Hassler only produced two works that were specifically meant for the Lutheran church. Under the commission of the free city of Nuremberg, the Psalmen simpliciter was composed in 1608, and was dedicated to the city. Hassler also produced the Psalmen und christliche Ges√§nge, mit vier Stimmen auf die Melodeien fugweis komponiert in 1607 and dedicated it to Elector Christian II of Saxony.Blume 1974, p.158. Stylistically, Hassler's early works exhibit reflections of the influence of Lassus, while his later works are marked by the impressions left on him by his studies in Italy. After returning from Italy, Hassler incorporated polychoral techniques, textural contrasts and occasional chromaticism in his compositions. His later masses were characterized by light melodies juxtaposed with the grace and fluidity of the madrigalian dance songs; thus creating a charming sacred style that was more sonorous than it was profound.Reese 1959, p.688. His secular music‚Äîmadrigals, canzonette, and songs among the vocal, and ricercars, canzonas, introits and toccatas among the instrumental‚Äîshow many of the advanced techniques of the Gabrielis in Italy, but with a somewhat more restrained character, and always attentive to craftsmanship and beauty of sound. However, Hassler's greatest success in combining the German and Italian compositional styles existed in his lieder.Reese 1959, p.711. In 1590, Hassler released his first publication, a set of twenty-four, four-part canzonette. The Lustgarten neuer teutscher Gesang, Balletti, Galliarden und Intraden, which contains thirty-nine vocal and eleven instrumental pieces, is Hassler's most renowned collection of lieder. Within this work, Hassler published dance collections for four, five, or six string or wind instruments with voice and without continuo.Bukofzer 1947, p.112. He also composed Mein G'm√ºt ist mir verwirret, a five-part piece. Its melody was later combined with the text O Haupt voll Blut und Wunden of Paul Gerhardt, in which form it was used by Bach in his St Matthew Passion. Bach also employed the melody as a counterpoint to the Aria, \\"Komm,Du Susse Todesstunde\\", in Cantata BWV 161 and used it once again as the final chorale melody in that same cantata. Along with many of his contemporaries, Hassler sought to blend the Italian virtuoso style with the traditional style prevalent in Germany. This was accomplished in the chorale motet by employing the thorough bass continuo and including instrumental and solo ornamentation.Sargent 1963, p.43. Hassler's motets exhibit this blend of the old and the new in the way they reflect both the influence of Lassus and the two four-part chorus style of the Gabrielis.Sargent 1963, p.27. Hassler is considered to be one of the most important German composers of all time. His use of the innovative Italian techniques, coupled with traditional, conservative German techniques allowed his compositions to be fresh without the modern affective tone.Bukofzer 1947, p. 98. His songs presented a combined vocal and instrumental literature that did not make use of the continuo, or only provided it as an option, and his sacred music introduced the Italian polychoral structures that would later influence many composers leading into the Baroque era.

The character is one of Batman's first recurring villains and is also one of the first Batman villains to discover the hero's secret identity. The character first appeared in Detective Comics #36 (Feb 1940). Fictional character biography =Pre-Crisis= Earth-One Professor Hugo Strange first appears in Detective Comics #36 (February 1940) as a scientist who uses a stolen \\"concentrated lightning\\" machine to generate a dense fog every night, allowing his gang to rob banks unseen, though he knows that Batman poses a threat to him. Batman, who already knows of Strange's experiments, begins investigating him after one of his henchmen kills a man. When his henchmen are apprehended, Strange vows to set a trap for Batman as the next target on his list of crimes. When Batman arrives, over a dozen of Strange's men are waiting for him, and one of them knocks him out with a blackjack. He wakes up in Strange's lair, where Strange hangs him from his wrists and lashes him with a whip. Batman breaks the ropes, gases the room, and defeats Strange, who is jailed but plans to escape.Detective Comics #36 In Batman #1 (spring 1940) he escapes from the \\"city asylum\\" with a gang of criminals, then breaks out \\"five insane patients\\" and uses them as test subjects, turning them into hulking 15 ft. tall monsters by administering a powerful artificial growth hormone that acts on the pituitary gland. They wear bulletproof clothing, and he releases them to wreak havoc in Gotham City while his men commit robberies. Strange administers the serum to Batman after the giants capture him, saying it will work in 18 hours. Batman tricks two of the monsters into killing each other, and then saves himself by creating a drug that prevents any abnormal secretions from the pituitary gland. He is then able to kill all the other monsters, and sends Strange to his apparent death in a fall from a cliff, although he suspects that the mad scientist has survived.Batman #1 In Detective Comics #46 (December 1940), Strange starts spreading a fear-inducing powder around the city until a punch from Batman again sends him falling to his apparent death.Detective Comics #46 He returned years later in the 1970s in the \\"Strange Apparitions\\" story arc in Detective Comics #469-479 (May 1977-September‚ÄìOctober 1978). Having survived his earlier \\"death\\" (how this happened is never explained, seen or shown), Strange left Gotham City and went to Europe for several years, where his criminal career was successful. Seeking a challenge and wanting to pit his wits against Batman again, Strange, now using the alias of Dr. Todhunter, is running a private hospital named Graytowers Clinic for Gotham's wealthiest citizens ‚Äî where he holds them for ransom and changes them into monsters. When Bruce Wayne checks into the hospital to recover discreetly from radiation burns he sustained while fighting Doctor Phosphorus, Strange finds out that Wayne is Batman and proceeds to wreak havoc on his personal life. Strange then attempts to auction off the identity of Batman to Gotham City Council president \\"Boss\\" Rupert Thorne, the Penguin, and the Joker. Thorne has Strange abducted and beaten by his men to reveal Batman's identity, but Strange apparently dies without ever telling him. Strange's ghost then comes back to haunt Thorne, driving the council president insane. Thorne confesses his long career of corruption and is sent to Arkham Asylum.Detective Comics #469-476 Strange's ghost returns again to haunt Thorne in Detective Comics #513 (April 1982), #516 (July 1982), #518 (September 1982), and #520 (November 1982) and Batman #354 (December 1982), leading up to the appearance of the real Hugo Strange in the last panel of the last page of the fifth issue mentioned here. As revealed two issues later in Batman #356 (February 1983), Strange had indeed survived the beating from Thorne's men by using yoga techniques to slow his heartbeat to an undetectable level. It is also revealed that Strange artificially created the \\"ghost\\" that haunted Thorne using strategically-placed devices that simulated the \\"ghost's\\" appearances, which drove him to confess to the authorities. Upon his return, Strange used the devices again to bring back the \\"ghost\\" in order to have his revenge on Thorne. Subsequently, Strange attempts to weaken Bruce Wayne through the use of drugs and robots called Mandroids, with the ultimate goal of usurping the mantle of Batman. The plan fails, and Strange apparently dies once more when he attempts to kill Batman by blowing up a replica of Wayne Manor with himself in it, stating that if he cannot be Batman, then no one can. Batman survives the explosion.Detective Comics #513, 516, 518, and 520 and Batman #354 and 356 Later, Strange returns yet again (the Hugo Strange that \\"died\\" in the explosion was revealed to be just another Mandroid by the real one) in Batman Annual #10 (1986), in another attempt to destroy Batman and Bruce Wayne, this time attempting to financially bankrupt Wayne by using various tricks to force three Wayne Enterprise shareholders to sell their stocks to him, allowing him to bankrupt Wayne. He also attempts to frame Batman as a criminal. However, Strange is defeated and sent to prison. Batman casts further doubt on Strange's deductions of his identity by claiming that he hypnotized Strange to give him a fake idea of Batman's true identity just before Commissioner Gordon showed up to make the arrest, leaving Strange doubting his own knowledge of Batman's identity as he wonders if Batman is attempting a complex double-bluff by letting him think that Bruce Wayne is Batman.Batman Annual #10 Earth-Two The Earth-Two version of Strange has a similar early history to the Earth-One version and also survives the fall that he experienced in Detective Comics #46. In The Brave and the Bold #182 (January 1982), it is revealed that he is left paralyzed by the fall but, after years of physical therapy, he regains enough movement to write out the surgical techniques needed to repair the damage to his body - and bribes a surgeon to perform the operation. The surgeon lacks Strange's skill, and the operation leaves Strange physically deformed (the surgeon is then killed for his failure). Strange uses one of his devices to capture Starman's Cosmic Rod to use its power to attack everyone and everything that Batman holds dear. He generates a storm in Gotham to obtain the device, which creates a dimensional doorway to Earth-One, bringing that universe's Batman over to Earth-Two, which allows him and Earth-Two's Robin to join with Earth-Two's Batwoman in defeating Strange. Strange realizes that he is, in fact, angry at his own wasted life and deformed body, so he uses the Cosmic Rod to commit suicide.The Brave and the Bold #182 =Post-Crisis= In the Post-Crisis continuity, Strange was reintroduced in the \\"Prey\\" storyline as a psychiatrist enlisted to help a police task force capture Batman. While brilliant at his work, Strange is depicted as being equally unbalanced: he is so obsessed with Batman, he takes to dressing up like Batman in private, convinced that he understands the darkness that drives Batman, when he really constantly underestimates Batman's strength. According to Commissioner Gordon, Strange was \\"abandoned as a child, grew up in state homes. A bright kid, but he apparently had a hell of a temper. Nobody knows how he put himself through college and medical school.\\" He was raised in an orphanage on the lower East Side of Gotham, not far from the infamous \\"Crime Alley\\", in the heart of a part of Gotham known as \\"Hell's Crucible\\". Strange became a Professor of Psychiatry at Gotham State University, but had his tenure suspended due to his increasingly bizarre genetic engineering theories. At some point, he is approached by an Indian man named Sanjay, who seeks Strange's aid in curing his sick brother. Strange agrees to help, and Sanjay works loyally by his side from that point onward. Borrowing money from gangster Sal Maroni, who is in the employ of Gotham's criminal kingpin Carmine Falcone, Strange sets up a laboratory. He then bribes a corrupt orderly to give him incurably insane inmates from Arkham Asylum‚Äîthose who have been institutionalized for so long that they will not be missed. Strange's experiments have literally monstrous results, with his test subjects turning into gigantic, mindless \\"Monster Men\\", possessing superhuman strength and cannibalistic instincts. Strange uses these Monster Men to raise the money that he needs to pay back his Mafia connections. Batman becomes involved after discovering some of the gruesome remains of the Monster's Men's cannibalistic rampages. When Strange sets his creations free at an illegal poker game, helping himself to the victims' money after the slaughter, his Mafia connections begin to grow suspicious. Batman tracks Strange down, but is captured by Sanjay and thrown to the Monster Men as an intended meal. Batman not only holds off the creatures, but uses them in part of an inventive escape. Strange is enthralled by Batman, believing that he has found a genetically perfect man. He creates one final Monster Man using a drop of Batman's blood, and while his creation still has many of the flaws of its \\"brothers\\", it lacks most of the grotesque disfigurements that had plagued Strange's earlier creations. Strange is forced to destroy his lab in order to evade capture. Soon after, he turns the Monster Men loose, including Sanjay's brother (who had also been mutated in a failed attempt to cure him), at Falcone's estate, where Strange's Mafia connections are staying. Strange wants a fresh start, and realizes that the Mafia is still a link to his experiments. In the battle that follows, all of the Monster Men are killed, along with Sanjay (who was attempting to avenge his brother). Strange escapes amid the chaos, and succeeds in eradicating all links between himself and his experiments. Confident that he can not be linked to them, he begins to appear on TV as a psychological expert on the Batman.Dark Moon Rising: Batman and the Monster Men #1‚Äì6 It is possible that the events of Doug Moench and Paul Gulacy's \\"Prey\\" storyline take place at this point. Partly due to Hugo Strange's appearance on TV as a psychological expert, Captain Gordon is ordered to assemble a task force to capture Batman (with Strange working as a consultant to it, in order to deduce Batman's secret identity). As the task force's investigation progresses, Strange grows increasingly maniacal in his obsession with Batman, going so far as expressing a desire to become Batman and dressing up in a replica Batsuit. To that end, Strange attempts to kill the Caped Crusader and permanently replace/impersonate him. However, Strange repeatedly underestimates the level of physical conditioning that is needed to be Batman (e.g., incorrectly theorizing that Batman was driven into activity by a personal tragedy suffered within just the past five years‚Äîwhile Gordon already knows that a lifetime of training would really be required). Strange also diagnoses Batman with various personality disorders, such as explaining Batman's use of a costume as symptomatic of multiple personality disorder, whereas Gordon more accurately explains the Batsuit's intended purpose as \\"scaring the pants off criminals\\". Strange eventually concludes that Bruce Wayne is most likely Batman, brainwashes the task force's commander into becoming a lethal vigilante (as part of a plot to turn public sentiment against Batman) and kidnaps the Mayor's daughter while dressed as the Dark Knight. Despite Strange's attempt to psychologically \\"break\\" Batman by creating recordings and mannequins of Thomas and Martha Wayne blaming Bruce for their deaths, which he sets up in Wayne Manor, Bruce is able to collect himself and focus in the Batcave. The following day, he confronts Strange and tricks Strange into doubting his own hypothesis about Batman's secret identity, claiming that his parents live in Paraguay and that he has no idea what Strange is talking about when he discusses mannequins. Strange is ultimately exposed, but he is shot twice by the task force when he attempts to escape dressed in his replica Batsuit, and falls into a river. Hugo Strange is then presumed dead.Batman: Legends of the Dark Knight #11-15 In Doug Moench's \\"Terror\\" storyline, Strange mysteriously returns. He decides to work with another of Batman's enemies, the Scarecrow, and use him as a tool to help him capture Batman, while simultaneously having fallen into a further delusional state, as he engages in a \\"relationship\\" with a female mannequin dressed in Batman's cowl, reflecting his warped dual admiration and loathing of Batman. The Scarecrow turns on Strange when Strange's therapy proves effective enough to turn the Scarecrow against his \\"benefactor\\", tricking Strange into falling into the cellar of his mansion base where the twisted psychiatrist is impaled on a weather vane that the Scarecrow had left in the cellar earlier. The Scarecrow then uses Strange's mansion as a trap for Batman, but his attempt to use Strange's plan fails when he only learns of Strange's plan to use Crime Alley as the scene of a trap while ignorant of the reasons why that alley is so significant to Batman, with his \\"trap\\" merely consisting of luring Batman into the alley and decapitating a former classmate of Crane's in front of Batman. With Catwoman's help, Batman locates the Scarecrow's hideout and catches the Scarecrow in the cellar with Strange's body before the house is destroyed in a fire, but loses sight of Strange, with it being unclear whether Strange had actually survived the fall onto the weather vane-he claimed that he lured rats to himself by using his sweat so that he could eat themor if the Scarecrow and Batman were hallucinating from exposure to Crane's new fear gas, although Batman concludes that the subsequent explosion of the house has definitely killed Strange.Batman: Legends of the Dark Knight #137‚Äì141 Dark Moon Rising: Batman and the Monster Men, \\"Prey\\" and \\"Terror\\" all take place during Batman's early years. In the modern timeline, Strange returns in a four-part storyline called \\"Transference\\". Initially appearing in his own Batsuit, he captures Catwoman with the aid of his henchwoman Doraa former patient whose identity issues have been 'focused' by Strange so that she will act as Catwoman, albeit wielding a gunand attempts to interrogate her about Batman's current status, Strange dismissing the existence of Batman's new allies by proclaiming them to be \\"parasites\\", as he cannot accept that Batman would share his \\"power\\". He is then shown posing as a psychiatrist doing standard stress evaluations at Wayne Enterprises. While Bruce Wayne is on the couch, Strange drugs him with a powerful hallucinogen in order to coax Wayne into admitting that he is Batman. Wayne is able to escape using a cleaning fluid from the office storage cupboard to start a fire, dresses as Batman to fake the Dark Knight's death when the Batmobile explodes just as he lands in it, and triggers a post-hypnotic suggestion in himself, forcing him to completely repress the Batman aspect of his mind until Robin and Nightwing can defeat Strange. Faced with Nightwing and Robin each denying that Wayne is Batman and Wayne's own obvious lack of combat reflexes, Strange becomes concerned that his theory that Bruce Wayne is Batman has been disproved and that he may have actually killed Batman. Faced with this conflicting situation, Strange has a mental breakdown and voluntarily turns himself in at Arkham Asylum.Batman: Gotham Knights #8-11 Following that, Strange reappears as the head of a gang of supervillains attempting to take control of Gotham's East Side, then controlled by Catwoman. Catwoman joins Strange's gang, then allows its members to \\"find out\\" that she intends to betray them, faking her death when they attempt to eliminate her. Although she defeats and imprisons most of the gang, and even convinces Strange to leave the East Side alone, Strange still mocks her by pointing out that he had faked his own death far more often than she had.Catwoman (vol. 3) #46-49 In Batman #665, Batman tells Tim Drake that a huge man dressed like a combination of Bane and Batman had beaten him up and he suspects that the impostor had used \\"Hugo Strange's monster serum and daily Venom shots\\" to gain his size and strength.Batman #665 In the story arc Gotham Underground, Strange is associating with other supervillains such as the Mad Hatter, Doctor Death and Two-Face. Strange and the others are rounded up by the Suicide Squad.Batman: Gotham Underground #1 and 3 Strange takes part in the miniseries Salvation Run. He is among the supervillains imprisoned on another planet.Salvation Run #2 Strange also appears in The Batman Adventures, which is set in the DC Animated Universe. Issues #35-36 of the comic book provide him with a tragic backstory: he witnessed the murder of his son David by mob boss Rupert Thorne and was so overcome with grief that he sought to literally erase the memory with his mind control technology. The plan backfired, however; following the experiment, he could remember nothing but his son's death. After Batman stops him from killing Thorne, Strange is imprisoned in Arkham Asylum.The Batman Adventures #35-36 =The New 52= The New 52 (a 2011 reboot of the DC Comics universe) introduces the reader to Hugo Strange's son Eli Strange for the first time.Detective Comics (vol. 2) #5 (March 2012) Eli is first seen playing a game of poker with the Russian Mob, betting a valuable bracelet, winning big and cleaning house. Before he can walk away with his winnings, the mobster forces him to play another hand, in which he discovers Eli's sleeve is loaded with cards. Before he can give the order to have him killed, the mobster's thugs realize that their bracelet (Eli's was a fake replica) had been stolen. Catwoman pounces from the ceiling and takes out the entire group of criminals. She thanks Eli for being her distraction (the two having been working together the entire time) and tells him to run home to his father, which he is last seen doing. Later, Strange uses Eli to oversee an operation to dose Gotham with fear gas. The Scarecrow led Batman to believe that a small boy in a picture would be harmed unless he put a stop to it. Arriving at the scene, Batman realizes that the small boy was actually Eli. He manages to avert the disaster and Eli is arrested.Detective Comics (vol. 2) #10 (August 2012) During the Forever Evil storyline, Hugo Strange is among the supervillains recruited by the Crime Syndicate to join the Secret Society of Super Villains.Forever Evil #1 =DC Rebirth= Hugo Strange appears in DC Rebirth during the Night of the Monster Men crossover event.http://screenrant.com/batman-rebirth-monster-men/ Although apparently now ignorant of Batman's identity, he is now determined to prove his superiority by attacking Gotham with a group of \\"Monster Men\\" created from corpses of former patients as representations of what Strange perceives as Batman's greatest flaws: his ego, grief, manipulative nature, childhood, and basic fear, ultimately provoking Batman into a confrontation at Strange's office penthouse headquarters. Strange wears what he terms a \\"suicide suit\\"-a near-replica of the Batsuit without the cape and cowl that is rigged to detonate if its wearer is subjected to any physical attack-on the assumption that Batman will have no choice but to surrender the cowl to him as the \\"true\\" Batman. Nightwing is able to defeat the final monster-an amalgamation of the previous ones-by literally leaping inside it to inject it with a pre-prepared antidote, while Batman outwits Strange by having Clayface cover the penthouse in an airtight seal prior to the confrontation. It results with a delirious Strange losing consciousness while Batman is still standing, Nightwing musing that Strange failed to realize that Batman's flaws were actually his motivation in protecting Gotham.Detective Comics #942 Other versions =Batman '66= In the Batman '66 universe, Hugo Strange is initially a psychiatrist at the Arkham Institute, until being revealed as a villain in Batman '66 Meets the Man from U.N.C.L.E..Batman '66 Meets the Man from U.N.C.L.E. #1 =DC Bombshells= In the DC Bombshells universe, Hugo Strange is a eugenicist attempting to improve the gene pool. He weeds out what he considers unclean.DC Comics Bombshells #13 Following Killer Frost's plan to create a race of superhumans, Strange allied himself with the Penguin and Harvey Dent. With Harvey Dent at the head of Gotham City, Strange would have had access to all Gothamites' genes and control the generations to come. When the Batgirls attempted to stop the Penguin and his allies, Hugo Strange used his modified gun to force the Batgirls to fight each other. However, Dent eventually betrayed the Penguin and him in favor of the Batgirls. Strange fled in response, promising to find other scientists who share his dream. Strange found new allies within the Soviets. They fund his researches and he created several clones using Supergirl's DNA, of which two of them are Power Girl, who became the U.S.S.R.'s secret weapon, and Superman, who he considered a failure.DC Comics Bombshells #28 One year later, Strange captured Supergirl and Steve Trevor. With Supergirl as a guinea pig, Strange intended to create a perfect army in order to purge the world. During the tests, Supergirl was able to turn Power Girl against Strange, and the Reaper and Lois Lane, who had found the laboratory thanks to Killer Frost, blew up the laboratory's security system. Strange attempted to stop the Reaper, Lois Lane, Steve Trevor, Power Girl and Supergirl using his remaining clones. However, they were able to leave the place without a fight, taking Superman with them.DC Comics Bombshells #29 In other media =Television= Live action BD Wong as Hugo Strange in Gotham * Professor Hugo Strange makes his live action debut in season two of Gotham, portrayed by BD Wong. He is depicted as the insane Chief of Psychiatry at Arkham Asylum and overseer of Indian Hill, a secret division of Wayne Enterprises that performs inhumane experiments on superhuman individuals. In this continuity, Strange has a major effect on several villains in the Batman rogues gallery: subjecting Oswald Cobblepot to mind- altering experiments to make him a contributing member of society; and transforms Victor Fries and Bridgit Pike into Mr. Freeze and the Firefly, respectively. His number one project is resurrecting the dead; starting with Theo Galavan, whom he reinvents as the warrior Azrael. It is also revealed that he was a friend and colleague of Bruce Wayne's father Thomas, playing a role in the Wayne murders, and that his resurrection experiments are funded by a mysterious council. But the actions of a resurrected Fish Mooney lead to Strange's arrest while the various specimens in his care are set loose in Gotham. In Season 3, Fish Mooney breaks him out of his prison cell to find a cure for her condition. The Penguin corners them in the woods, but decides to let them escape, and Fish and Strange leave Gotham. Before they depart, the Penguin tells both of them to never return to Gotham City. In the episode \\"Heroes Rise: Light the Wick\\", Hugo Strange is brought back to Gotham City by Kathryn Monroe of the Court of Owls into extracting Alice Tetch's poisonous blood from Nathaniel Barnes and weaponizing it. He tests the weaponized blood on a man that the Court of Owls obtained. James Gordon and Harvey Bullock later found the secret lab where he was working. After tranquilizing the test subject, Hugo Strange gave them the research on the weaponized blood and a sample that he secretly kept from the Court of Owls, in exchange that they do not arrest him, and caused the Court of Owls to go ahead with their plans early. In \\"A Dark Knight: No Man's Land\\", Hugo Strange helps to restore Solomon Grundy back to Butch Gilzean. When the bodies of the Riddler and Leslie Thompkins are brought to him by the Penguin's men, Strange starts to work on them. In the fifth season, it is shown that Nyssa al Ghul (under the alias of Theresa Walker) ordered Strange to use mind-control chips on Nygma and Lee. The chips in their heads are eventually fried and destroyed by Gordon. The episode \\"Nothing's Shocking\\" reveals that Hugo Strange was also responsible for the creation of shapeshifter Jane Doe. In \\"I Am Bane\\", Professor Strange transformed Eduardo Dorrance into Bane on Nyssa al Ghul/Walker's orders. Strange's fate after the rest of the fifth season is unknown. Animation Hugo Strange in Batman: The Animated Series Hugo Strange in Justice League Unlimited * Hugo Strange appears in the DC Animated Universe: ** Hugo Strange is introduced in Batman: The Animated Series, voiced by Ray Buktenica. This version is a psychiatrist that runs a rest hospital that he uses to blackmail Gotham City's elite with secrets via a machine that reads minds. He only appeared in the episode \\"The Strange Secret of Bruce Wayne\\", where Bruce Wayne goes to the hospital and undergoes the \\"treatment\\", which allows Strange to discover Bruce's double life as Batman. He then auctions off this information to a trio of Gotham's top crime bosses: the Joker, the Penguin, and Two-Face. After the villains simply pool their money and pay Strange rather than competing, Batman manages to switch the video with the Dark Knight's identity with a manufactured one which shows Strange boasting about his plan to scam the villains by giving them a fake identity for Batman. In an attempt to save himself, Strange blurts out that Batman is Wayne and the disbelieving trio then tries to kill him by throwing him out of an airplane. However, Batman saves him at the last minute and had Dick Grayson (disguised as Bruce Wayne) show up at the crime scene to discredit Strange's claims of knowing Batman's secret identity. Strange is then taken into police custody. ** Hugo Strange is seen in a non-voiced cameo appearance in Justice League Unlimited. In the episode \\"The Doomsday Sanction\\", he is now a member of Project Cadmus seated at a table within Cadmus' headquarters with no lines. It is possible that Strange is the one who provides Amanda Waller with Batman's real identity. Producer/writer Dwayne McDuffie confirmed that the character's appearance was intended to set up for the episode \\"Question Authority\\" during a torture scene to pull information from the Question's mind. But due to the production of The Batman, Warner Brothers withheld most Batman characters and Strange is replaced in Cadmus by Doctor Moon. * Hugo Strange appears in The Batman voiced by Frank Gorshin and later by Richard Green. In this series, he is the chief psychologist at Arkham Asylum. Strange appears briefly in the episode \\"Meltdown\\" and as a primary character in the episode \\"Strange Minds\\". Strange is portrayed as being far more fascinated with the deranged criminals at Arkham Asylum and how their minds work than actually finding a cure for their madness, on more than one occasion provoking them to cause more mayhem. In this interpretation, he is a master chemist and programmer and skilled at robotics. In the episode \\"Fistful of Felt\\", Strange cures the Ventriloquist of his multiple personality disorder, only to turn him again into a criminal. Despite his insistence that it was simply a test to see if he is truly cured, Batman warns Strange that he will be watching him. In the episode \\"Gotham's Ultimate Criminal Mastermind\\", he does in fact design a robotic villain called D.A.V.E. to hunt down Batman. He pulls a gun out at Batman, thus sealing his reputation as a villain. He is currently incarcerated in Arkham, having been ironically dubbed insane by his former colleagues. In the episode \\"Strange New World\\", Strange (from his cell in Arkham) infects Batman and Robin with a toxin, claiming it to be an antidote. Under the drug's influence, the Dynamic Duo hallucinate that they are being pursued by zombies. Hugo claims that he has distributed a chemical throughout town, making everyone into zombies that obey his every command. This is later revealed to be a lie, concocted in order to trick Batman into spreading the real chemical. Robin is cured about halfway through the episode. Batman realizes the truth at the last moment and allows Batgirl to cure him. Even later in the same season, Strange appears as one of the many supervillains that are held hostage by the vigilante Rumor. As Rumor moves to the machine that he would use to execute all the criminals at once, Strange asks him about his motivation. Rumor replies that he wants to kill them all in retaliation for an attack by the Joker that crippled his boss. Strange laughs and tells him that the scheme is in fact motivated by his guilt over his failure to protect his boss, rather than any sense of altruism or desire to protect Gotham from the captured villains. Strange later appears in the series finale \\"Lost Heroes\\", working with the Joining, helping them to capture the Justice League and extract their powers in return for ultimate knowledge of the universe. When Strange's work was complete, the Joining kept their promise, but the massive amount of information (delivered directly into his brain) overloaded his cerebral cortex, leaving him catatonic. * Hugo Strange appears in the Batman: The Brave and the Bold episode \\"The Knights of Tomorrow!\\". Strange appears with his Monster Men and is defeated by Batman and Catwoman. This episode was all part of a story that Alfred Pennyworth was writing. * Hugo Strange appears in the series Young Justice voiced by Adrian Pasdar. Introduced in the episode \\"Terrors\\", Hugo is the psychiatrist of Belle Reve working under warden Amanda Waller. During Icicle I's breakout attempt, Strange and Waller are trapped in a cell by the escaped inmates. After the breakout is thwarted by Superboy and Miss Martian, all of the prisoners (sans the Riddler) are rounded up and returned to their cells. Strange then ends up becoming the new warden of the prison. In the episode's closing moments, it is revealed that he had been working with Icicle I the entire time as part of a plot to take control of the prison on behalf of the Light (Project Cadmus' Board of Directors).Young Justice, \\"Terrors\\" In the episode \\"Humanity\\", Strange was seen viewing a surveillance of the team interrogating Professor Ivo on where T. O. Morrow's hideout is. Hugo even allows Ivo to send a transmission to Morrow (impersonated by the Red Volcano at the time) warning him that Young Justice is heading his way. In the episode \\"Coldhearted\\", Batman and Flash visit Strange at Belle Reve where they state that they suspected that Captain Cold, Icicle I, Icicle II, Killer Frost and Mr. Freeze were behind the flying ice fortresses that buried the U.S. in winter. Strange shows Batman and Flash some security footage stating that the five ice villains have never left their cells. As of the episode \\"Usual Suspects\\", his role in helping prisoners escape is known by the JLA and he is not seen again, meaning he is either on the run or has been captured in the five-year break between seasons one and two. * Hugo Strange appears in a short animated film created by Bruce Timm in honor of Batman's 75th anniversary titled Batman: Strange Days, voiced by Brian George. Strange has one of his Monster Men kidnap a woman to use her blood for an experiment, but Batman fires tear gas on them. Strange takes the woman hostage, but Strange falls off a cliff when he backs away from Batman unto unstable ground. The woman asks if it is over, to which Batman replies \\"For now\\", casting ambiguity on Strange's fate. =Film= * Hugo Strange appears in The Lego Batman Movie. He is one of several villains allied with the Joker. * Hugo Strange appears in Batman vs. Two-Face, which is the second animated film based on the 1960s Batman TV series, voiced by Jim Ward in a German accent. In this film, Strange is a Gotham State Penitentiary doctor using a \\"Evil Extractor\\" on volunteering criminals the Joker, the Penguin, the Riddler, Egghead, and Mr. Freeze, who will be purified of their corruption. At a demonstration with his assistant Harleen Quinzel, the Dynamic Duo and city officials, the containment vat is ruptured, exposing Harvey Dent to the energies, transforming him into Two-Face. Strange is later kidnapped and coerced by Two-Face to aid him in exposing Gotham to the same gas, even corrupting Robin. Strange is later arrested after Harvey Dent has conquered his evil persona. * Hugo Strange appears in Batman: Gotham by Gaslight, voiced by William Salyers. He appears as the director of Arkham Asylum. Strange shows a deep fascination with the concepts of masks and alternate identities, which draws him to both Batman and Jack the Ripper. He approaches Bruce Wayne at Sister Leslie's funeral and offers his insight on the Ripper's identity, hinting at the possibility that he has also deduced Bruce's identity as Batman. Later in his office at Arkham, Strange is approached by who he thinks is Batman, but is instead Jack the Ripper. Jack the Ripper then kills Strange by throwing him into a pit full of deranged Arkham patients, allowing them to rip him to pieces. =Video games= Batman: Arkham Hugo Strange in a cinematic trailer for Batman: Arkham City * Hugo Strange's character bio is unlockable in Batman: Arkham Asylum. He is revealed as having once been a psychiatrist at Arkham Asylum. * Hugo Strange appears in Batman: Arkham City, voiced by Corey Burton. According to Rocksteady Studios, this is the first time that Batman has faced him in this continuity.http://au.ign.com/articles/2011/02/14/batman-arkham-city-gotham-on- lockdown Professor Hugo Strange, who has a shady past involving controversial experiments with behavior control, brainwashed Warden Quincy Sharp into becoming his puppet during his time at the asylum. It is also revealed that he did some experiments on the patients at the asylum that later created the Arkham Lunatics. After the events of Arkham Asylum, Strange has Sharp run for mayor to obtain almost-unlimited influence over the city. Soon, Sharp was elected, and Strange ordered him to propose a project called \\"Arkham City\\", a city-sized detention facility where criminals were allowed to run rampant. Once the project is authorized, Strange is appointed warden of the facility. It is revealed that he also brainwashed and manipulated ex-military contractors, known as the TYGER Guards, into serving him by using technology created by the Mad Hatter. He continues his unethical research, disposing of anybody who attempts to uncover the truth by committing them to Arkham City. The game opens with Strange capturing Bruce Wayne (whom he knows is Batman's alter ego), and throwing him into Arkham City to die. During a conversation between the two, Strange claims that an operation code-named \\"Protocol 10\\" will mark Batman's failure and make him famous. Near the end of the game, \\"Protocol 10\\" is revealed to be the wholesale extermination of Arkham's criminal populace after their professional interest to Strange has expired. He accomplishes this by letting inmates \\"steal\\" TYGER weapons and convincing City Hall that the inmates have taken control of Arkham City and that \\"Protocol 10\\" was the only way to stop them. When his private security force massacres hundreds of inmates with a barrage of air-to-surface missile strikes, Batman steals the codes for Strange's security from an attack chopper and breaches Wonder Tower, Strange's headquarters. Breaking through many TYGER Guards, Batman eventually reaches Strange and forcibly deactivates the operation. As Batman confronts him, Strange is stabbed in the back, both literally and figuratively, by Ra's al Ghul, who is revealed to be the benefactor and true mastermind of Strange's operation. While Batman argues with Ra's al Ghul over his plan, Strange's last act before succumbing to his wounds is activating Protocol 11, a self-destruct sequence for his command tower. Batman pushes Ra's al Ghul out the window, leaving Strange inside as the tower explodes. Inmates can later be heard talking about Strange's sinister plan and how they are glad that he is dead, one inmate even noting that Strange is \\"spread\\" all over Arkham City.

It contains the first published description of the logical design of a computer using the stored-program concept, which has controversially come to be known as the von Neumann architecture. History Title page the First Draft, copy belonging to Samuel N. Alexander, who developed the SEAC computer based on the report. Von Neumann wrote the report by hand while commuting by train to Los Alamos, New Mexico and mailed the handwritten notes back to Philadelphia. Goldstine had the report typed and duplicated. While the date on the typed report is June 30, 24 copies of the First Draft were distributed to persons closely connected with the EDVAC project five days earlier on June 25. Interest in the report caused it to be sent all over the world; Maurice Wilkes of Cambridge University cited his excitement over the report's content as the impetus for his decision to travel to the United States for the Moore School Lectures in Summer 1946. Synopsis Von Neumann describes a detailed design of a \\"very high speed automatic digital computing system.\\" He divides it into six major subdivisions: a central arithmetic part, CA, a central control part, CC, memory, M, input, I, output, O, and (slow) external memory, R, such as punched cards, Teletype tape, or magnetic wire or steel tape. The CA will perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, division and square root. Other mathematical operations, such as logarithms and trigonometric functions are to be done with table look up and interpolation, possibly biquadratic. He notes that multiplication and division could be done with logarithm tables, but to keep the tables small enough, interpolation would be needed and this in turn requires multiplication, though perhaps with less precision. Numbers are to be represented in binary notation. He estimates 27 binary digits (he did not use the term \\"bit,\\" which was coined by Claude Shannon in 1948) would be sufficient (yielding 8 decimal place accuracy) but rounds up to 30-bit numbers with a sign bit and a bit to distinguish numbers from orders, resulting in 32-bit word he calls a minor cycle. Two‚Äôs complement arithmetic is to be used, simplifying subtraction. For multiplication and division, he proposes placing the binary point after sign bit, which means all numbers are treated as being between ‚àí1 and +1 and therefore computation problems must be scaled accordingly. =Circuit design= Vacuum tubes are to be used rather than relays due to tubes‚Äô ability operate in one microsecond vs. 10 milliseconds for relays. Von Neumann suggests (Sec. 5.6) keeping the computer as simple as possible, avoiding any attempt at improving performance by overlapping operations. Arithmetic operations are to be performed one binary digit at a time. He estimates addition of two binary digits as taking one microsecond and that therefore a 30-bit multiplication should take about 302 microseconds or about one millisecond, much faster than any computing device available at the time. Von Neumann's design is built up using what he call \\"E elements,\\" which are based on the biological neuron as model,Von Neumann credits this model to Warren McCulloch and Walter Pitts, A logical calculus of the ideas immanent in nervous activity, Bull. Math. Biophysics, Vol. 5 (1943), pp. 115‚Äì133Von Neumann had worked closely with McCulloch and Pitts. See The Man Who Tried to Redeem the World with Logic, Amanda Gefter, Nautilus, Issue 21, February 4, 2015 but are digital devices which he says can be constructed using one or two vacuum tubes. In modern terms his simplest E element is a two input AND gate with one input inverted (the inhibit input). E elements with more inputs have an associated threshold and produce an output when the number of positive input signals meets or exceed the threshold, so long as the (only) inhibit line is not pulsed. He states that E elements with more inputs can be constructed from the simplest version, but suggests they be built directly as vacuum tube circuits as fewer tubes will be needed. More complex function blocks are to be built from these E elements. He shows how to use these E elements to build circuits for addition, subtraction, multiplication, division and square root, as well as two state memory blocks and control circuits. He does not use Boolean logic terminology. Circuits are to be synchronous with a master system clock derived from a vacuum tube oscillator, possibly crystal controlled. His logic diagrams include an arrowhead symbol to denote a unit time delay, as time delays must be accounted for in a synchronous design. He points out that in one microsecond an electric pulse moves 300 meters so that until much higher clock speeds, e.g. 108 cycles per second (100 MHz), wire length would not be an issue. The need for error detection and correction is mentioned but not elaborated. =Memory design= A key design concept enunciated, and later named the Von Neumann architecture, is a uniform memory containing both numbers (data) and orders (instructions). > \\"The device requires a considerable memory. While it appeared that various > parts of this memory have to perform functions which differ somewhat in > their nature and considerably in their purpose, it is nevertheless tempting > to treat the entire memory as one organ, and to have its parts even as > interchangeable as possible for the various functions enumerated above.\\" > (Sec. 2.5) \\"The orders which are received by CC come from M, i.e. from the > same place where the numerical material is stored.\\" (Sec. 14.0) Von Neumann estimates the amount of memory required based on several classes of mathematical problems, including ordinary and partial differential equations, sorting and probability experiments. Of these, partial differential equations in two dimensions plus time will require the most memory, with three dimensions plus time being beyond what can be done using technology that was then available. He concludes that memory will be the largest subdivision of the system and he proposes 8,192 minor cycles (words) of 32-bits as a design goal, with 2,048 minor cycles still being useful. He estimates a few hundred minor cycles will suffice for storing the program. He proposes two kinds of fast memory, delay line and Iconoscope tube. Each minor cycle is to be addressed as a unit (word addressing, Sec. 12.8). Instructions are to be executed sequentially, with a special instruction to switch to a different point in memory (i.e. a jump instruction). Binary digits in a delay line memory pass through the line and are fed back to the beginning. Accessing data in a delay line imposes a time penalty while waiting for the desired data to come around again. After analyzing these timing issues, he proposes organizing the delay line memory into 256 delay line \\"organs\\" (DLAs) each storing 1024 bits, or 32 minor cycles, called a major cycle. A memory access first selects the DLA (8 bits) and then the minor cycle within the DLA (5 bits), for a total of 13 address bits. For the Iconoscope memory, he recognizes that each scan point on the tube face is a capacitor and that a capacitor can store one bit. Very high precision scanning will be needed and the memory will only last a short time, perhaps as little as a second, and therefore will need to be periodically recopied (refreshed). =Orders (instructions)= In Sec 14.1 von Neumann proposes the format for orders, which he calls a code. Order types include the basic arithmetic operations, moving minor cycles between CA and M (word load and store in modern terms), an order (s) that selects one of two numbers based on the sign of the previous operation, input and output and transferring CC to a memory location elsewhere (a jump). He determines the number of bits needed for the different order types, suggests immediate orders where the following word is the operand and discusses the desirability of leaving spare bits in the order format to allow for more addressable memory in the future, as well as other unspecified purposes. The possibility of storing more than one order in a minor cycle is discussed, with little enthusiasm for that approach. A table of orders is provided, but no discussion of input and output instructions was included in the First Draft. Controversy The treatment of the preliminary report as a publication (in the legal sense) was the source of bitter acrimony between factions of the EDVAC design team for two reasons. First, publication amounted to a public disclosure that prevented the EDVAC from being patented; second, some on the EDVAC design team contended that the stored-program concept had evolved out of meetings at the University of Pennsylvania's Moore School of Electrical Engineering predating von Neumann's activity as a consultant there, and that much of the work represented in the First Draft was no more than a translation of the discussed concepts into the language of formal logic in which von Neumann was fluent. Hence, failure of von Neumann and Goldstine to list others as authors on the First Draft led credit to be attributed to von Neumann alone. (See Matthew effect and Stigler's law.)

Normally in mammalian cells this enzyme is suppressed by cholesterol derived from the internalization and degradation of low density lipoprotein (LDL) via the LDL receptor as well as oxidized species of cholesterol. Competitive inhibitors of the reductase induce the expression of LDL receptors in the liver, which in turn increases the catabolism of plasma LDL and lowers the plasma concentration of cholesterol, which is considered, by those who accept the standard lipid hypothesis, an important determinant of atherosclerosis. This enzyme is thus the target of the widely available cholesterol-lowering drugs known collectively as the statins. HMG-CoA reductase is anchored in the membrane of the endoplasmic reticulum, and was long regarded as having seven transmembrane domains, with the active site located in a long carboxyl terminal domain in the cytosol. More recent evidence shows it to contain eight transmembrane domains. In humans, the gene for HMG-CoA reductase (NADPH) is located on the long arm of the fifth chromosome (5q13.3-14). Related enzymes having the same function are also present in other animals, plants and bacteria.  Structure  The main isoform (isoform 1) of HMG-CoA reductase in humans is 888 amino acids long. It is a polytopic transmembrane protein (meaning it possesses many alpha helical transmembrane segments). It contains two main domains: *a conserved N-terminal sterol-sensing domain (SSD, amino acid interval: 88‚Äì218). The related SSD of SCAP has been shown to bind cholesterol. *a C-terminal catalytic domain (amino acid interval: 489-871), namely the 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-CoA reductase domain. This domain is required for the proper enzymatic activity of the protein. Isoform 2 is 835 amino acids long. This variant is shorter because it lacks an exon in the middle region (amino acids 522‚Äì574). This does not affect any of the aforementioned domains.  Function  HMGCR catalyses the conversion of HMG-CoA to mevalonic acid, a necessary step in the biosynthesis of cholesterol: { Mevalonate pathway } =Interactive pathway map=  Inhibitors  = Drugs = Drugs that inhibit HMG-CoA reductase, known collectively as HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (or \\"statins\\"), are used to lower serum cholesterol as a means of reducing the risk for cardiovascular disease. These drugs include rosuvastatin (CRESTOR), lovastatin (Mevacor), atorvastatin (Lipitor), pravastatin (Pravachol), fluvastatin (Lescol), pitavastatin (Livalo), and simvastatin (Zocor). Red yeast rice extract, one of the fungal sources from which the statins were discovered, contains several naturally occurring cholesterol-lowering molecules known as monacolins. The most active of these is monacolin K, or lovastatin (previously sold under the trade name Mevacor, and now available as generic lovastatin). Vytorin is drug that combines the use simvastatin and ezetimibe, which slows the formation of cholesterol by every cell in the body, along with ezetimibe reducing absorption of cholesterol, typically by about 53%, from the intestines. Statins, HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, are competent in lowering cholesterol levels and reducing cardiac-related diseases. However, there have been controversies surrounding the potential of statins increasing the risk of new-onset diabetes mellitus (NOD). Experiments have demonstrated that glucose and cholesterol homeostasis are regulated by statins. The HMG-CoA reductase (HMGCR), converts HMG-CoA into mevalonic acid. Thus, when HMGCR activities are reduced, the cell associated cholesterols are also reduced. This results in the activation of SREBP-2-mediated signaling pathways. SREBP-2 activation for cholesterol homeostasis is crucial for the upregulation of low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor (LDLR). The removal of LDL particles from blood circulation is enhanced when the number of LDLR on hepatocytes increases. Due to the removal of atherogenic lipoprotein particles, such as LDLs and intermediate density lipoproteins, HMGCR inhibitors have been proven to be efficient in reducing cardiovascular diseases from the blood circulation, which is represented by the reduction of LDL-cholesterol levels. In many studies, lipophilic statins are shown as more diabetogenic, possibly due to the fact that they can easily diffuse into cells and inhibit the production of isoprenoids which become more potent. Although statins have been shown to be beneficial for cardiovascular issues, there are concerns over an increased risk of new onset diabetes mellitus (NOD). Additionally, statins have been shown to change glucose levels as well. = Hormones = HMG-CoA reductase is active when blood glucose is high. The basic functions of insulin and glucagon are to maintain glucose homeostasis. Thus, in controlling blood sugar levels, they indirectly affect the activity of HMG-CoA reductase, but a decrease in activity of the enzyme is caused by AMP-activated protein kinase, which responds to an increase in AMP concentration, and also to leptin  Clinical significance  Since the reaction catalysed by HMG-CoA reductase is the rate-limiting step in cholesterol synthesis, this enzyme represents the sole major drug target for contemporary cholesterol-lowering drugs in humans. The medical significance of HMG-CoA reductase has continued to expand beyond its direct role in cholesterol synthesis following the discovery that statins can offer cardiovascular health benefits independent of cholesterol reduction. Statins have been shown to have anti-inflammatory properties, most likely as a result of their ability to limit production of key downstream isoprenoids that are required for portions of the inflammatory response. It can be noted that blocking of isoprenoid synthesis by statins has shown promise in treating a mouse model of multiple sclerosis, an inflammatory autoimmune disease. HMG-CoA reductase is an important developmental enzyme. Inhibition of its activity and the concomitant lack of isoprenoids that yields can lead to germ cell migration defects as well as intracerebral hemorrhage.  Regulation  Substrate complex (Blue:Coenzyme A, red:HMG, green:NADP) Regulation of HMG- CoA reductase is achieved at several levels: transcription, translation, degradation and phosphorylation. = Transcription = Transcription of the reductase gene is enhanced by the sterol regulatory element binding protein (SREBP). This protein binds to the sterol regulatory element (SRE), located on the 5' end of the reductase gene after controlled proteolytic processing. When SREBP is inactive, it is bound to the ER or nuclear membrane with another protein called SREBP cleavage-activating protein (SCAP). SCAP senses low cholesterol concentration and transports SREBP to the Golgi membrane where a consecutive proteolysis by S1P and S2P cleaves SREBP into an active nuclear form, nSREBP. nSREBPs migrate to the nucleus and activate transcription of SRE-containing genes. The nSREBP transcription factor is short-lived. When cholesterol levels rise, Insigs retains the SCAP-SREBP complex in the ER membrane by preventing its incorporation into COPII vesicles. = Translation = Translation of mRNA is inhibited by a mevalonate derivative, which has been reported to be the isoprenoid farnesol, although this role has been disputed. = Degradation = Rising levels of sterols increase the susceptibility of the reductase enzyme to ER-associated degradation (ERAD) and proteolysis. Helices 2-6 (total of 8) of the HMG-CoA reductase transmembrane domain are thought to sense increased cholesterol levels (direct sterol binding to the SSD of HMG-CoA reductase has not been demonstrated). Lysine residues 89 and 248 can become ubiquinated by ER-resident E3 ligases. The identity of the multiple E3 ligases involved in HMG-CoA degradation is controversial, with suggested candidates being AMFR, Trc8, and RNF145 The involvement of AMFR and Trc8 has been contested. = Phosphorylation = Short-term regulation of HMG-CoA reductase is achieved by inhibition by phosphorylation (of Serine 872, in humans). Decades ago it was believed that a cascade of enzymes controls the activity of HMG-CoA reductase: an HMG-CoA reductase kinase was thought to inactivate the enzyme, and the kinase in turn was held to be activated via phosphorylation by HMG-CoA reductase kinase kinase. An excellent review on regulation of the mevalonate pathway by Nobel Laureates Joseph Goldstein and Michael Brown adds specifics: HMG-CoA reductase is phosphorylated and inactivated by an AMP-activated protein kinase, which also phosphorylates and inactivates acetyl-CoA carboxylase, the rate-limiting enzyme of fatty acid biosynthesis. Thus, both pathways utilizing acetyl-CoA for lipid synthesis are inactivated when energy charge is low in the cell, and concentrations of AMP rise. There has been a great deal of research on the identity of upstream kinases that phosphorylate and activate the AMP-activated protein kinase. Fairly recently, LKB1 has been identified as a likely AMP kinase kinase, which appears to involve calcium/calmodulin signaling. This pathway likely transduces signals from leptin, adiponectin, and other signaling molecules.

The name of the uprising derives from the fact that the peasants armed themselves with various blunt weapons, such as cudgels, flails and maces, as they were seen as the most efficient weapons against their heavily armoured enemies. The yeomen also had swords, some firearms and two cannons at their disposal. Their opponents, the troops of Clas Eriksson Fleming, were professional, heavily armed and armoured men-at- arms. Modern Finnish historiography sees the uprising in the context of the conflict between Duke Charles and Sigismund, King of Sweden and Poland (War against Sigismund). Charles agitated the peasants to revolt against the nobility of Finland, who supported Sigismund in the conflict. War A memorial plaque dedicated to the fallen peasants An uprising began on Christmas Eve 1595 and was initially successful, but shortly thereafter was crushed by cavalry. In December 1596, the Cudgel War began. The peasants won a number of encounters with infantry. Klaus Fleming began negotiating a truce that required the surrender of peasant leader Jaakko Ilkka. Ilkka fled to avoid being handed over and the peasant army scattered, pursued by the soldiers. At least 1500 were killed within the next two months. Along with Ilkka, five other rebellion leaders were executed on January 27, 1597. Final part of the rebellion A Cudgel War memorial Israel Larsson was named as the new governor of central and northern Ostrobothnia, and planned to support the rebellion. However, he fled rather than face Fleming. Leaderless, the peasants opened battle with Fleming on February 24, 1597. Over 1000 were killed and 500 captured. The insurgents were mostly Finnish peasants from Ostrobothnia, Northern Tavastia and Savo. The events can also be seen as a part of a larger power struggle between King Sigismund and Duke Charles. Legacy In his work Nuijasota, sen syyt ja tapaukset (1857‚Äì1859) (), historian and fennoman Yrj√∂ Koskinen (n√© Forsman) saw the peasants as fighting for freedom and justice. Fredrika Runeberg's Sigrid Liljeholm (1862), one of the first historical novels in Finland, depicts women's fates during the war. Albert Edelfelt's painting Burned Village (1879) depicts a woman, a child, and an old man hiding behind a rock as a village burns in the background. The poet Kaarlo Kramsu praised the insurgents and lamented their defeat in patriotic poems such as Ilkka, Hannu Krankka, and Santavuoren tappelu, published in Runoelmia (1887). After the Finnish Civil War, the debate has centered on an interpretation that emphasizes Duke Charles's role in inciting the revolt, as found in Pentti Renvall's Kuninkaanmiehi√§ ja kapinoitsijoita Vaasa-kauden Suomessa (1949); and an explanation that stresses the roots of the rebellion in social injustice and class conflict, as argued by Heikki Ylikangas in Nuijasota (1977). A historical reenactment of the Cudgel War is conducted yearly in the Kavalahti scout camp. Jaakko Ilkka took the 75th place in the Great Finns TV show. A commemorative silver coin was also minted to mark the occasion.

(PIR2) D 180 also known as Domitia Lepida the Younger, or Domitia Lepida Minor, (c. 5 BC - 54 AD); was the younger daughter of consul, Lucius Domitius Ahenobarbus and Antonia Major. Her elder sister was Domitia Lepida the Elder and her younger brother was Gnaeus Domitius Ahenobarbus, father of the Emperor Nero. She was the great niece of Emperor Augustus, granddaughter of Octavia the Younger and Triumvir Mark Antony, second cousin to the Emperor Caligula, first cousin and mother-in-law to the Emperor Claudius and paternal aunt of the Emperor Nero. Lepida was a beautiful and influential figure.Tacitus, Annals, 12.64 Like her sister, she was also very wealthy. She had holdings in Calabria and owned the praedia Lepidiana.Raepsaet-Charlier M.-Th., Prosopographie des femmes de l'ordre s√©natorial (Ier-IIe si√®cles), 2 vol., Louvain, 1987, 285 ff; p.286 Biography Lepida was married three times. Her first husband was her cousin, Marcus Valerius Messalla Barbatus. (ed.), Prosopographia Imperii Romani, 3 vol., Berlin, 1897-1898. (PIR1) V 88Suetonius, Vita Claudii, 26.29 Lepida married Barbatus probably around 15 AD, suggesting that she was born in approximately 4 BC. It was standard for princesses in the imperial family to marry before their 18th birthday.Barrett, Anthony A., Agrippina: Sex, Power and Politics in the Early Roman Empire. Yale University Press, New Haven, 1996; p. 287 n. 154. See also Gaius Stern, \\"Women, Children, and Senators on the Ara Pacis Augustae, Chapter 6 (Berk. Diss. 2006). They had a daughter, Valeria Messalina (c. 17/20-48 AD), who became Empress and third wife to the Emperor Claudius. Barbatus most likely died around 20 or 21 AD, shortly after Messalina was born. It is extremely unlikely that Marcus Valerius Messala Corvinus was their son, since Lepida's son by her second husband reached the consulship earlier than Messala. Lepida's second husband was Faustus Cornelius Sulla Lucullus,PIR2 C 1459 consul suffectus in 31 AD, a descendant of the dictator Lucius Cornelius Sulla. Their son, Faustus Cornelius Sulla Felix was born c. 22 AD and married Claudia Antonia, the daughter of Claudius through his second marriage to Aelia Paetina.PIR2 C 1464Dio 60.30.6a Faustus Cornelius Sulla died in 62. At the beginning of the reign of her son-in-law, Claudius, Lepida, now a widow, married Appius Junius Silanus, (cos. AD 28). In the following year (42 AD), Silanus was put to death by Claudius, allegedly because he had plotted to assassinate Claudius, but the rumor circulated that Messalina had framed him after he resisted her advances. Lepida was the maternal grandmother to Messalina's children Claudia Octavia (step-sister and first wife of Nero) and Britannicus. In 48 AD, Messalina was executed on the orders of Claudius, due to Messalina's mock marriage with her lover Gaius Silius which swiftly evolved into a failed coup d'√©tat. During Messalina's heyday, Lepida argued with Messalina and they became estranged (this likely followed Appius Silanus' execution). In Messalina's last hour in the Gardens of Lucullus, Lepida was at her side and encouraged her to end her own life.Tacitus, Annals 11.37 After Messalina was stabbed with a dagger by an officer, her body was given up to Lepida. Lepida's former sister-in-law, Agrippina the Younger, became Claudius' new wife in 49 AD. Out of jealousy, Agrippina arranged the execution of Lepida sometime before the poisoning of Claudius, after which Nero became the new emperor. Agrippina charged Lepida with attempting to take her life by magic, disturbing Roman peace, and failing to control her Calabrian slave-gangs. Agrippina thought that Lepida would use her 'kind' influence on Nero to turn him against his mother. Cultural depictions She was played by Moira Redmond in the 1976 BBC TV series I, Claudius.

It was written by Valentin Chernykh and directed by Vladimir Menshov. The leading roles were played by Vera Alentova and by Aleksey Batalov. The film won the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film in 1981. The film received mixed reviews from critics. Plot The film is set in Moscow in 1958 and 1979. The plot centers on three young women: Katerina, Lyudmila, and Antonina, who come to Moscow from smaller towns. They are placed together in a workers' dormitory room and eventually become friends. Antonina (Raisa Ryazanova) is seeing Nikolai, a reserved but kind young man whose parents have a dacha in the country. Katerina (Vera Alentova) is a serious, upstanding woman who strives to earn her chemistry degree while working at a factory. She is asked to house-sit an apartment for her well-to-do Moscow relatives (a famous professor's family) while they are away on a trip. Lyudmila (Irina Muravyova), a flirty go-getter looking for a well-to-do husband while working at a bakery, convinces her to throw a dinner party at the apartment, and pretend that they are the daughters of Katerina's professor uncle, as a ploy to meet successful Muscovite men. At the party, Lyudmila meets Sergei, a famous hockey player, who falls in love with her and marries her even after discovering the truth about her origin. Katerina meets Rodion (Yuri Vasilyev), a smooth talker who works as a cameraman for a television channel. They start dating. During Antonina and Nikolai's wedding, Lyudmila and Antonina find out that Katerina is pregnant. Upon discovering that Katerina deceived him and is not the daughter of a professor, Rodion refuses to marry her and believes that she is to have an abortion. Katerina is unable to get an abortion because her pregnancy is in a late stage and ends up giving birth. The film shows Katerina, with tears in her eyes, setting her alarm clock in the dormitory room she shares with her daughter, Aleksandra (subsequently played as a grown young woman by Natalya Vavilova). The film then takes a 20-year leap forward in time to 1979. Katerina is shown waking up to the sound of an alarm clock in her own apartment. She is still single, but she has gone from being a down on her luck student to becoming the executive director of a large factory. She has a lover, an older married man named Vladimir (Oleg Tabakov), but she leaves him after he shows himself to be cowardly and disrespectful. Despite her successful career, Katerina is unfulfilled and weighed down by a deep sadness. She is still close friends with Lyudmila and Antonina. By this time Sergei has quit playing hockey and become an alcoholic, having divorced Lyudmila, who is working at a laundry. Antonina is happily married and has three children. One evening, when Katerina is returning home from Antonina's dacha in the countryside on an elektrichka, she meets a man, Gosha (Aleksey Batalov), who starts a dialogue with her. She sees his shabby boots and dismisses him at first, but the dialogue continues. Soon afterward they start seeing each other. Gosha is an intelligent tool-and-die maker who believes that a woman must not make more money than her husband, so Katerina doesn't tell him about her position. As their romance begins, Rodion unexpectedly reenters Katerina's life when he is assigned to film an interview with her to do a report on her factory's success at exceeding its production quota. At first, he does not recognize Katerina, but when he does, he wants to meet his daughter. Katerina tells him that she does not want to see him again. Nonetheless, Rodion shows up uninvited at her apartment when Katerina is having dinner with Gosha and Aleksandra. Rodion tells Gosha and Aleksandra about the interview, and Gosha finds out that Katerina is a factory director. His pride is hurt not only because of Katerina's high position and large salary, but also because she has deceived and offended him before, and he leaves the apartment. Unable to stop him, Katerina is upset with Rodion. She reveals to Aleksandra that Rodion is, in fact, her father. Gosha disappears from Katerina's life. She becomes frantic. Lyudmila, Antonina, and Nikolai come to her apartment to comfort her. Nikolai gathers what little information Katerina knows about Gosha and sets out to find him. Gosha has been binge- drinking at home for days, and Nikolai, during a \\"men's talk\\" over vodka, defends Katerina and convinces Gosha to return. Sobered up Gosha brings drunk Nikolai to Katerina's flat and asks for a dinner. As he eats, Katerina watches him, saying \\"I have been looking for you for so long\\". Gosha replies that it's been only a few days, to which Katerina repeats, with tears in her eyes, \\"I have been looking for you for so long...\\".

Population: History Stalin-era buildings flanking Kursk's Red Square Pre-1917 view of Kursk The first written record of Kursk is dated 1032. It was mentioned as one of Severian towns by Prince Igor in The Tale of Igor's Campaign: \\"Saddle, brother, your swift steeds. As to mine, they are ready, saddled ahead, near Kursk; as to my Kurskers, they are famous knights‚Äîswaddled under war-horns, nursed under helmets, fed from the point of the lance; to them the trails are familiar, to them the ravines are known, the bows they have are strung tight, the quivers, unclosed, the sabers, sharpened; themselves, like gray wolves, they lope in the field, seeking for themselves honor, and for their prince, glory.\\"The Song of Igor's Campaign, Igor son of Svyatoslav and grandson of Oleg. Translated by Vladimir Nabokov. 78‚Äì95 The seat of a minor principality, Kursk was raided by the Polovtsians in the 12th and 13th centuries and destroyed by Batu Khan around 1237. The city was rebuilt no later than 1283. It was ruled by Grand Duchy of Lithuania between 1360 and 1508. Kursk joined the centralized Russian state in 1508, becoming its southern border province. It was an important center of the corn trade with Ukraine and hosted an important fair, which took place annually under the walls of the monastery of Our Lady of Kursk. However, a century later the city re-emerged in a new place; date of re-considered grounds Kursk 1586 [9]. In 1596 a new fortress was built, in 1616 it was garrisoned by over 1,300 soldiers. At the beginning of the 17th century Kursk was repeatedly attacked by Polish-Lithuania (in 1612, 1616, 1617, 1634), the Crimean Tatars, and the Nogai horde, but Kursk fortress was never taken. Residents of Oryol and other southern Russian cities were resettled in Kursk (by 1678 2,800 had been resettled). The city developed due to its advantageous geographical position on the shortest route from Moscow to the Crimea and from Kiev to the Crimea. It was raided frequently by the Polish‚ÄìLithuanian Commonwealth and Crimean Khanate until the late 17th century and was ruled by the Polish‚ÄìLithuanian Commonwealth between 1611 and 1618. It was successively part of the Kiev Governorate (1708‚Äì1727), Belgorod Governorate (1727‚Äì1779), and Kursk Viceroyalty (1779‚Äì1797). Town status was granted to Kursk in 1779. It became the administrative center of Kursk Governorate in 1797. After a fire in 1781 devastated Kursk, a new plan for the city was developed in which a market center would be at the heart of the city (it was erected in the central square, known as Red Square). In 1768 the Voskirsensko Ilinskaya Church was built (). In 1778 both the Sergiev Cathedral Kazan Cathedral Baroque and Trinity Sergius Cathedral were completed. The city opened its first school for the nobility in 1783. A men's gymnasium was opened in 1808 and a seminary in 1817. A women's gymnasium was opened in 1870. At the beginning of the 20th century Kursk played a dominant role in the food industry (Kvilitsu AK, one of the largest breweries in Russia, operated in Kursk) and in other industries as well; so, in the 1900s, appeared in the city 4 sitoproboynye shops (of which the largest was a workshop Tikhonov, products are sent to foreign markets - Germany, Austria-Hungary, etc.). Organized several engineering enterprises (in 1914 there were seven, including one - rail). Working conditions in the factories of Kursk were harsh and often resulted in strikes (for instance, from 1901-03 the workers at the sugar mill went on strike). Kursk workers participated in the general political strike during the 1905 Russian Revolution. On November 26 (December 9,) 1917 the Soviets took power. Kornilovites came to Kursk in September 20, 1919. On September 20, 1919, troops under the command of General Denikin entered the city. On November 19, 1919, the Red Army took Kursk. The Soviet government valued Kursk for rich deposits of iron ore and developed it into one of the major railroad hubs in the Russian southwest. In 1932 in the Kursk was included Yamskaya Sloboda. In 1935 a tram system began operating in the city. In 193?, the territory of the city of Kursk was divided into Leninsky District (left bank of the Kura), Dzerzhinsky District (right bank of the Kura) and Kirov District (Yamskaya Sloboda). In 1937 Stalinsky District was formed in the southern outskirts of the city. During World War II, Kursk was occupied by Germany between . In July 1943, the Germans launched Operation Citadel in an attempt to recapture Kursk. During the resulting Battle of Kursk, the village of Prokhorovka near Kursk became the center of a major armoured engagement ‚Äì the Battle of Prokhorovka ‚Äì between Soviet and German forces, which is widely considered to have been one of the largest tank battles in history. Operation Citadel was the last major German offensive against the Soviet Union. Rebuilding efforts in the city began in February 1944. The cultural life recovered as well: on 19 February the cinema reopened and on February 27 the drama theatre. In 1953 the tram system began operating. By 1950 the urban economy had been completely restored. On , Stalinsky District was renamed Promishlenost District, and Dzerzhinsky District was abolished and its territory divided between Promishlenost and Leninsky Districts. In 2009, for the first time in 90 years at the site of Theotokos of Kursk, the most revered icon in the Russian Orthodox Church, received the name Hodigitria Russian diaspora. Until 2010, Kursk had the status of historical settlement, but the Russian Ministry of Culture deprived the city of this status on in resolution ‚Ññ 418/339. On , for the first time in 30 years, the city opened a new firehouse for the protection of the Central District, with modern equipment. In 2012, Kursk celebrated its 980th anniversary. Administrative and municipal status Kursk is the administrative center of the oblast and, within the framework of administrative divisions, it also serves as the administrative center of Kursky District, even though it is not a part of it.Resolution #489 As an administrative division, it is incorporated separately as the city of oblast significance of Kursk‚Äîan administrative unit with the status equal to that of the districts. As a municipal division, the city of oblast significance of Kursk is incorporated as Kursk Urban Okrug.Law #48-ZKO Economy and infrastructure Kursk Nuclear Power Plant In addition to its importance as an administrative hub, Kursk is important as an industrial centre. Activity focuses on iron based industry, the chemical sector and a large food processing industry, reflecting the richness of agriculture in the surrounding \\"Black Earth\\" region. Particularly noteworthy is the so-called Kursk Magnetic Anomaly (Russian: –ö—É—Ä—Å–∫–∞—è –º–∞–≥–Ω–∏—Ç–Ω–∞—è –∞–Ω–æ–º–∞–ª–∏—è), the world's largest known iron-ore reserve, where the iron content of the ore ranges from 35% up to 60%. In Kurchatov, some to the south-west, is the Kursk Nuclear Power Plant, incorporating four RBMK-1000 (\\"High Power Channel-type Reactor\\") (Russian: –†–µ–∞–∫—Ç–æ—Ä –ë–æ–ª—å—à–æ–π –ú–æ—â–Ω–æ—Å—Ç–∏ –ö–∞–Ω–∞–ª—å–Ω—ã–π) reactors similar to those implicated in the 1986 Chernobyl disaster. The oldest of the Kursk reactors has been operational since 1977, and the newest of them since 1986. Attractions The oldest building in Kursk is the upper church of the Trinity Monastery, a good example of the transition style characteristic of Peter the Great's early reign. The oldest lay building is the so-called Romodanovsky Chamber, although it was erected in all probability in the mid-18th century, when the Romodanovsky family had ceased to exist. The city cathedral was built between 1752 and 1778 in the splendid Baroque style and was decorated so sumptuously that many art historians attributed it to Bartolomeo Rastrelli. Although Rastrelli's authorship is out of the question, the cathedral is indeed the most impressive monument of Elizabethan Baroque not to be commissioned by the imperial family or built in the imperial capital. Religious Procession in Kursk Province, painting by Ilya Repin (1880‚Äì1883) Sergievsko-Kazansky Cathedral in Kursk, 1752‚Äì1778 Central Bank of Russia building The cathedral has two stories, with the lower church consecrated to St. Sergius of Radonezh and the upper one ‚Äî to the Theotokos of Kazan. The upper church is noted for an intricate icon screen which took sixteen years to complete. The three-story cathedral bell tower derives peculiar interest from the fact that Seraphim of Sarov, whose father took part in construction works, survived an accidental fall from its top floor at the age of seven. The Resurrection Church is also shown where St. Seraphim was baptized. The monastery cathedral of the Sign (1816‚Äì26) is another imposing edifice, rigorously formulated in the purest Neoclassical style, with a cupola measuring in diameter and rising high. The interior was formerly as rich as colored marbles, gilding, and frescoes could make it. During the Soviet period, the cathedral was desecrated, four lateral domes and twin belltowers over the entrance pulled down. There are plans to restore the church to its former glory. The modern city is a home for several universities: Kursk State Medical University, State Technical University, Kursk State University (former Pedagogical University) and Agricultural Academy, as well as the private Regional Open Social Institute (ROSI). There are also modern shrines and memorials commemorating the Battle of Kursk, both in the city and in Prokhorovka. The Command Station Bunker & Museum was built specifically in memorial of the courageous Russian T-34 tank units that fought in the Battle of Kursk, where a T-34 tank is on display. Over 6,000 armored vehicles fought in close range over the open territory near Kursk in 1943. This battle stopped the German advance into the Kursk Salient, and was a turning point of World War II on the Eastern Front. Kursk played a role in the Cold War as host to Khalino air base. Nearby is Tsentralno-Chernozemny Zapovednik, a large section of steppe soil that has never been plowed. It is used for a variety of research purposes.

Overview =People with whom marriage is prohibited= * permanent or blood mahrams include: ** all direct ancestors ** all direct descendants ** siblings ** siblings of parents, grandparents and further antecedents ** children and further descendants of siblings * in-law mahrams with whom one becomes mahram by marrying someone: ** all the ancestors of one's spouse ** all the descendants of one's spouse ** all who marry a direct ancestor ** all who marry a direct descendant (Note: A woman may marry her stepfather only if the stepfather has not consummated his marriage to her mother.) * Rada or \\"milk-suckling mahrams\\" with whom one becomes mahram because of being nursed by the same woman: ** foster mother and further female ancestors ** foster sibling When a woman acts as a wetnurse (that is she breast feeds an infant that is not her own child for a certain amount of time under certain conditions), she becomes the child's rada mother and everything concerning blood mahrams applies here, like rada father/mother, rada sister/brother, rada aunt/uncle and so on. In English these can be referred to as milk brother, milk-mother, and so on. For a man, mahram women include his mother, grandmother, daughter, granddaughter, sister, aunt, grandaunt, niece, grandniece, his father's wife, his wife's daughter (step- daughter), his mother-in-law, his rada mother and any other rada relatives that correspond to the above-mentioned blood relatives. As the Prophet said, \\"What is forbidden by reason of kinship is forbidden by reason of suckling.\\"Sahih al-Bukhari, No. 4776 - Narrated Abu Huraira: These are considered mahram because they are mentioned in the Quran (An-Nisa 22-23): > \\"And marry not women whom your fathers married, except what has already > passed; indeed it was shameful and most hateful, and an evil way. Forbidden > to you (for marriage) are: your mothers, your daughters, your sisters, your > paternal aunts, your maternal aunts, brother's daughters, sister's > daughters, your foster mothers, your sisters from suckling, mothers of your > spouses, your step-daughters from your those spouses you have entered into > them but if you have not entered into them then there is no blame on you, > spouses of your sons from your own loins and that you add two sisters except > that has passed; indeed God is forgiving and merciful. All of the man's female relatives mentioned in these two verses are considered his maharim, because it is unlawful (haram) for him to marry them, except the wife's sister, whom he can marry if he divorces her sister, or if his wife dies. The notion of mahram is reciprocal. All other relatives are considered non-maharim. =Legal escorts of women during journey= A woman may be legally escorted during a journey by her husband, or by any sane, adult male mahram by blood, including *her father, grandfather or other male ancestor *her son, grandson or other male descendant *her brother *her uncle, great uncle, or uncle from a previous generation *the son, grandson, or other descendant of her sibling Rules =Mahram= A Muslim woman's mahramss form the group of allowable escorts when she travels. An adopted brother who suckled from the mother of the woman is axiomatically a mahram. For a spouse, being mahram is a permanent condition. That means, for example, that a man will remain mahram to his ex-mother-in-law after divorcing her daughter. =Ghayr mahram (non-mahram)= An adopted sibling is ghayr mahram, and marriage is allowed to an adopted sibling of the opposite sex. The term \\"adopted\\" means those children who are adopted by one's parents for the purpose of providing shelter and upbringing and who do not fall under the relationships outlined under the section \\"Who is mahram?\\" above. One is ghayr mahram to one's ex-spouse. One must not stay with a ghayr mahram in seclusion where none of their mahrams is present (see also proxemics). If wives of a man each become a rada mother of a child, all children and all rada mothers will be mahram to each other.

It began with the publishing of Count Richard von Coudenhove- Kalergi's manifesto Paneuropa (1923), which presented the idea of a unified European State. Coudenhove-Kalergi, a member of the Bohemian Coudenhove- Kalergi family and the son of an Austro-Hungarian diplomat and a Japanese mother, was the organisation's central figure and President until his death in 1972. It is independent of all political parties, but has a set of four basic principles by which it appraises politicians, parties, and institutions: liberal conservatism, Christianity, social responsibility, and pro- Europeanism.

Otto von Habsburg, the head of the Habsburg dynasty and former Crown Prince of Austria-Hungary, became involved with the Paneuropean Union in the 1930s, was elected its Vice President in 1957 and became its International President in 1973, after Coudenhove's death. The President of the Union since 2004 is Alain Terrenoire, former Member of Parliament in France and MEP and Director of the French Paneuropa-Union. Otto Habsburg became the International Honorary President of the International Paneuropean Union in 2004. Its Vice President is Walburga Habsburg Douglas, a member of the Swedish Parliament. The Union has branches in many European countries, with the General Secretariat located in Munich. In France, the Pan- Europa Union was founded by later President Georges Pompidou and later cabinet minister Louis Terrenoire, with the support of Charles de Gaulle. The Union achieved high political influence in France, particularly within the Gaullist segment of French politics.

In 1947, the group formed around Duncan Sandys, Winston Churchill, Edvard Bene≈° and others split into newly formed European Movement in opposition of the Union's strong Christian right. Grounded in liberal values, the Paneuropean Union was considered staunchly anti-communist from its inception and especially during the Cold War. For this reason, the organisation was much reviled by the communist regimes of the Eastern Bloc. The organisation became renowned for its role in organising the Pan-European Picnic, an important event during the Revolutions of 1989.

A baby sling or baby carrier is a piece of cloth that supports an infant or other small child from a carer's body. The use of a baby sling is called babywearing. Types = Ring slings = Man wearing child in a ring sling These are baby carriers that use dynamic tension, a length of cloth and metal (such as aluminum) or nylon rings. One end of the cloth is sewn to two rings. The cloth wraps around the wearer's body from shoulder to opposite hip and back up to the shoulder, and the end is threaded through the rings to create a buckle effect. The baby sits or lies in the resulting pocket. Once a sling is threaded, it can be taken off and put back on without rethreading. A threaded sling forms a loop of cloth. The wearer can put one arm and the head through the loop of cloth to put the sling back on. When the baby is in the carrier, the baby's weight puts tension on the fabric, and the combination of fabric tension, friction of fabric surfaces against each other and the rings combine to \\"lock\\" the sling in position. This type of sling can adjust to different wearers' sizes and accommodate different wearing positions easily: the wearer supports the baby's weight with one hand and uses the other hand to pull more fabric through the rings to tighten or loosen the sling. Ring slings may be padded or unpadded at the shoulder, have padded or unpadded edges or \\"rails\\", and the \\"tail\\" of the sling may be open or closed. Some \\"hybrid\\" ring slings have curved seats sewn into the body, similar to the seam in a pouch. Ring slings are most closely related in use to the Mexican rebozo, the rings take the place of the knot. Variation is also found in how the rings attach to the cloth, commonly referred to as \\"shoulder style\\". Basic shoulder styles include gathered, pleated, \\"hot dog\\" or \\"center fold\\", pouch-style (folded in half) and many variations.Sisters wearing baby dolls in play slings Ring slings are highly adaptable and most care givers can wear a \\"one size fits most\\" size. As long as the tail is about 8\\" long a ring sling is still considered safe. Tail length is decided by personal preference with most preferring the tail to hit about hip or mid thigh. The recommended maximum weight limit for wearing baby in a ring sling is up to 35lbs. = Pouch slings = A woman with a baby in a pouch sling Sometimes called \\"tube\\", \\"pocket\\" or \\"ringless\\" slings, these are generally formed by a wide piece of fabric sewn into a tubular shape. Simple, or fitted pouches do not have rings or other hardware. Adjustable pouches may adjust with zippers, snaps, buckles, clips, rings, drawstrings, velcro, and other methods. Most pouches have a curve sewn in to shape the cloth to the parent's body and hold the baby more securely than a simple straight tube. The wearer slips the pouch over the head and one shoulder, sash-style, creating a pocket or seat to hold the baby in. Many pediatricians and baby-wearing experts do not recommend pouch slings because babies can suffocate when held incorrectly. Suffocation risk is greatest in newborns and infants under six months, and usually occurs because the baby's chin is collapsed against his or her chest, constricting the airway. Pouch slings also often restrict the parent's view of their child, making suffocation more likely. When using a pouch sling, wearers should be sure to keep the baby's face elevated and clearly visible. = Wraps = Wraps (sometimes called \\"wraparounds\\" or \\"wraparound slings\\") are lengths of fabric (usually between 2 metres and 6 metres, or 2.5‚Äì7 yards long, and 15‚Äì30 inches wide), which are wrapped around both the baby and the wearer and then tied. There are different carrying positions possible with a wrap, depending on the length of the fabric. A baby or toddler can be carried on the wearer's front, back or hip. With shorter wraps it is possible to do a one-shouldered carry, similar to those done with a pouch or a ring sling, although most carries involve the fabric going over both shoulders of the wearer and often around the waist to offer maximum support. There are two main types of wrap‚Äîstretchy and woven. Stretchy wraps are generally made of knits such as jersey or interlock. It is easy to take babies in and out of a stretchy wrap. This can be easier for the wearer as the sling often remains tied on and the baby is lifted out and put back in as required. Several factors influence stretchiness: carriers with any spandex or lycra content will tend to be very stretchy, carriers which are 100% cotton or other natural fibers will tend to have less lengthwise stretch. Woven wraps are pieces of woven fabric of varying thickness. Natural fibers are usually chosen, with cotton being the most common, but hemp, linen, silk and wool are also used. A variety of weaves are used. Most common are homespun or handwoven fabrics with simple over-under weaves, twills and jacquards. Most weaves provide some give or stretch diagonally. = Simple pieces of cloth = Man wearing baby in a homemade stretchy wrap sling Pieces of cloth can be turned into slings by wrapping the fabric around the carrier and the baby and either tying it with knots or using a twist and tuck method to secure the ends. Rebozos (Mexico), mantas (Peru), kangas (Africa) and selendangs (Indonesia) are all rectangular pieces of cloth but are tied or wrapped in many different ways. Wraps are also simple pieces of cloth. = The podaegi and other Asian-style baby carriers = The podaegi (, also spelled podegi) is a Korean carrier with a medium to large rectangle of fabric hanging from a very long strap. Traditionally the rectangle is quilted for warmth and wraps around the mother's torso, while the straps are wrapped snug under the baby's bottom and tied around to the front to support and secure the baby on the mother's back. Western interest in the podaegi style has led to new wrapping methods which do go over the shoulders, and to narrower \\"blankets\\". Variants of this shape include the Iu-Mienh/Hmong carrier and the Chinese bei bei. Iu-Mienh/Hmong carriers and bei beis are both customarily used with over-the-shoulder wrapping and often have stiff sections which help provide head support or block wind. The Chinese Mei-tai (, Cantonese pronunciation) - meaning mei: to carry on the shoulders / tai: strap, band - is a square or nearly square piece of cloth with parallel unpadded straps emerging from the sides of each corner. It was traditionally secured by bringing all the straps together in a twist with the ends tucked. A variation on the traditional mei tai was popularized in Australia in the 1960s. There are now hundreds of different brands of mei tai available with a variety of features, but the longer straps, taller body and wrap-style tying method are found in almost all of them. Mei tais are suitable for front or back carries with children ranging from birth to as heavy as a parent can support. Mei tai carrier Traditional babywearing in Japan was done with a wrap carry, using an obi (sash). In the 1940s, a carrier known as the onbuhimo became popular. Similar to the Hmong and Mei tai carriers, the onbuhimo has long top straps and a rectangular body. But at the bottom of the rectangle, loops or rings allow the top straps to be threaded through and tightened, while the straps are tied at the waist. The body is much smaller than the bodies of most mei tais and other Asian-style carriers, and the onbuhimo is traditionally used on the back. Variations may have stiff headrests or padding in the body. Variations of these basic shapes can be found elsewhere in the world. Mei-tai-like carriers were used in places as diverse as Sweden and Africa. = Other types of slings and baby carriers = Modern structured hip carriers, soft structured carriers (known as SSC) which can be used on front or back, structured front packs and hard-framed backpacks are also used. Hip carriers may be closely related to ring slings or they may be more closely related to a mei tai, and several different types of fasteners are used in different models. Most soft structured carriers are loosely based on the traditional mei tai with a main flat panels and four straps which are shortened and fitted with buckles for added convenience. File:Ergobabycarrier.jpgWoman wears an ERGO baby carrier on her back, a popular brand of soft structured carrier. File:Infant_carrier_1.jpgHard- framed backpack baby carrier  History  Traditionally, baby slings and carriers were simply adaptations of whatever a culture normally used to carry anything heavy. Baskets, calabashes, animal skins, and wooden carrying structures have all been adapted to carry infants and children. Inuit mothers continue to use the packing parka or amauti to carry children. In the west, this phenomenon has resulted in a variety of carriers based on camping backpacks. One design, used in New Guinea, resembles a small Mayan-style hammock, in which an infant or child is either carried in a net on the back of an adult, or hung on a tree branch or house beam. Historical photographs of indigenous peoples show babies worn in sashes, baskets and nets hung from the parent's forehead. Cradleboards and carriers hung from one shoulder like a purse have also been documented in several cultures.Babies Celebrated, Fontanel, B. 1998  Positions  A baby can also assume one of various positions while being carried in a sling. These include the vertical position, cradle hold, kangaroo carry, front carry, hip carry, and back carry.  Concerns  Some baby carriers have been recalled due to faulty design or manufacturing defects (usually in limited numbers of carriers from one particular time period). There have also been incidents of babies suffocating while in carriers, particularly \\"bag sling\\" styles, and Consumer Reports urged a recall of all slings of this type in 2009. Consumer Reports recommends soft infant carriers (mei tai or soft structured carriers) and backpack baby carriers over these styles. Advocates argue that other types of slings are safe, especially when the baby's face, nose, and mouth are visible at all times.

Edward Jones. Edward Ellsworth \\"Ned\\" Jones (August 11, 1926 ‚Äì July 30, 1993) was an influential American social psychologist, he is known as father of Ingratiation due to his major works in the area. He worked at Duke University and from 1977 at Princeton University. A Review of General Psychology survey, published in 2002, ranked Jones as the 39th most cited psychologist of the 20th century. Along with Keith E. Davis, he is known for developing correspondent inference theory within the field of psychological attribution. Biography He earned his Ph.D. in clinical psychology at Harvard University. In the classic text Fundamentals of Social Psychology, which he co-wrote with Harold B. Gerard and published in 1967, they explain: > Our aim has been to write a systematic presentation of social psychology > that emphasizes the experimental approach....Social psychology is a > subdiscipline of psychology that especially involves the scientific study of > the behavior of individuals as a function of social stimuli. This definition > seems to say something important and to say it with pedantic precision...By > the end of World War II, the way was paved for an outpouring of experimental > research involving the manipulation of experimental subjects' temporary > social environment and an examination of the effects of this manipulation on > attitudes, behavior, and various emotional states. Questions of behavioral > causation could now be examined with closer scrutiny than was possible > through questionnaires and interviews. The outlines of an empirical, and > especially an experimental, social psychology have clearly emerged.Edward E. > Jones and Harold B. Gerard, Fundamentals of Social Psychology, 1967, John > Wiley and Sons, Inc, pp. Preface-page 5 Jones's work is centered on the attribution process, co-developing his theory of correspondent inferences with Keith Davis. Jones noted, \\"I have a candidate for the most robust and repeatable finding in social psychology: the tendency to see behavior as caused by a stable personal disposition of the actor when it can be just as easily explained as a natural response to more than adequate situational pressures.\\" Edward E. Jones, Interpersonal Perception, WH Freeman and Co, 1990, p. 138 One of the best-known single papers co-authored with Victor Harris in 1967 tested this theory and led to the development of the fundamental attribution error. He also developed the Actor-observer bias with Richard E. Nisbett. He focused on the history and the advancement of the field of person perception in order to explore how perceivers and targets interact. One form of interaction that he examined closely resulted in a book on the psychology of ingratiation. In his book on ingratiation, he utilized the models of Goffman, Homans, Thibaut, and Kelley to arrive at the following working definition: \\"Combining these contributions, we may conclude that ingratiation is an illegitimate member of the social exchange family because the ingratiator presents himself as a party to one kind of exchange‚Äîwith one set of terms and conditions‚Äîwhile in fact he is primarily engaged in another kind.\\" Edward E. Jones, Ingratiation: a social psychological analysis, (Century Psychology Series), Meredith Publishing Company, 1964, pp. 11-15 He further noted the importance of studying ingratiation where he wrote: \\"A more valid reason for studying ingratiation is that light might be shed on other common social phenomena such as the antecedents of group cohesiveness, the conditions of social influence and conformity, and the significance of social reinforcement in sequences of social interaction.\\" He was also an opponent of behaviorism. In 2004, a book of his selected works was published by John Wiley & Sons, edited by former student Daniel Gilbert. Notable contributions * Work on Fritz Heider's attribution error, termed fundamental attribution error by Lee Ross, which is also known as \\"correspondence bias\\". As Gilbert noted, \\"As geometry was to architecture, so attribution theories were to person perception. Experiments revealed that people's attributional inferences looked very much like the attributional inferences that a thinking system would generate if it was relying on formal attributional rules such as the calculus of non-common effects, the covariation and discounting principles and so on. But no one knew whether people were actually using those rules, and if they were, certainly no one knew how.\\" Daniel Gilbert, Speeding with Ned: A personal view of the correspondence bias. In J. M.

A famous 1956 version is sung by Trio Los Panchos and female vocalist Gigliola Cinquetti. An English lyric was written by Sunny Skylar. It is one of the most famous boleros, and was recognized in 1999 as the most sung and recorded Mexican song in the world. The song appeared in the film Follow the Boys (5 May 1944) when it was played by Charlie Spivak and his Orchestra and in Cowboy and the Senorita (13 May 1944) with vocal by Dale Evans. Inspiration According to Vel√°zquez herself, she wrote this song even though she had never been kissed yet at the time, and kissing, as she heard, was considered a sin. She was inspired by the piano piece \\"Quejas, o la Maja y el Ruise√±or\\", from the 1911 suite Goyescas by Spanish composer Enrique Granados, which he later also included as \\"Aria of the Nightingale\\" in his 1916 opera of the same name.

Founded in 1934 by Al C. Kalmbach, it is published monthly by Kalmbach Media of Waukesha, Wisconsin. Commonly found on newsstands and in libraries, it promotes itself as the oldest magazine of its type in the United States, although it is the long-standing competitor to Railroad Model Craftsman, which - originally named The Model Craftsman - predates MR by one year. MR is considered to be a general-interest hobby magazine, appealing to a wide range of hobbyists, rather than specializing in a particular scale, or facet of the hobby (such as prototype operations or scratch building and kitbashing). Model Railroader covers a variety of scales and modeling techniques for engines, rolling stock, right-of-way, structures, and scenery. It reviews products including ready-to-run models as well as kits, tools and supplies. The magazine presents blueprints and photographs of prototype equipment, as well as photographs of models and layouts. A longstanding philosophy of modeling is manifest in its editorial features of layout design and operation, in which the model is viewed as a three-dimensional and temporal compression of the real world, so that, for example, the motive power, freight, trackage and scenery of a real-world railroad are formed into a layout which captures the spirit of not only the equipment and region of the railroad but also its purpose and how it operates. The magazine is published under . Individual issues use the UPC 074820085486.  History  The Model Railroader began publication in the summer of 1933, with a cover date of January 1934. A press release announcing the magazine appeared in August 1933, but did not receive much interest. The bank refused to loan Kalmbach any money, many felt sorry for him, and a few told him he was crazy. His first wife, Bernice, herself a journalist, encouraged and helped Al put The Model Railroader together. Though they originally saw it as a sideline business to their commercial printing operations, soon they were devoting seven days a week to the venture. The magazine was well received by model railroaders, and the young publisher carried the entire first press run (272 copies) by streetcar to be mailed. By July 1934, paid circulation exceeded 1,000 copies. Growth continued, but the magazine was not an immediate success. The magazine became profitable after three years. It took Kalmbach seven years to pay off the loans used to launch the magazine. World War II introduced paper rationing, which dampened the growth of the Kalmbach Publishing Company. At the end of the war, MR's circulation was about 20,000. By 1950, MR's circulation had grown to more than 100,000, thanks in part to a boom in interest in model railroading. As of 2007, the magazine had a monthly paid circulation of more than 160,000.\\"Neil Besougloff named Editor of Model Railroader magazine,\\" press release, June 11, 2007. The magazine, and Kalmbach Publishing (now Kalmbach Media), celebrated its 85th anniversary in 2019.  Features  Typical feature articles in each month's issue include: * Layout tours - A layout story with a detailed track plan and behind-the-scenes modeling and construction tips. * How-to projects - Tips and techniques for modeling scenery, structures, rolling stock, and electronics. * Prototype information - Detailed drawings historical and technical information on how real railroads and lineside industries function. * Track plans - Sample designs for model railroads the average hobbyist could build.

Typical articles focus on reproducing prototype track arrangements, overcoming modeling obstacles, and researching prototype railroads. Other special issues on various aspects of the hobby are released on an irregular basis. Titles have included 102 Track Plans for Model Railroaders, How to Build Realistic Layouts, and How to Build More Layout in Less Space. A bi-monthly web video show, Modeler's Spotlight Video - Inside Cody's Office, is available to magazine subscribers via MR's website.Index of Cody's Office episodes . The show introduces new products, offers modeling tips, and a viewer mail segment (along with the occasional blooper at the end). Many of the blueprints, layout plans, articles on operation and signaling, and methods of construction of bridges, structures and scenery are also collected in books published by Kalmbach Books. These are useful to modelers in general, railroad historians, and are valuable references on the steam and diesel eras. Past MR articles are also collected in PDF form and distributed via the magazine's website and available through their digital archive. Model Railroader staff members participated in the production of the Dream-Plan-Build video series,Dream-Plan-Build Video Series . which was offered by subscription. The DVDs focused on prototype railroading information, layout visits, and modeling techniques. Model Railroader also produces Model Railroader Video Plus (MRVP)http://mrv.trains.com/ which does layout tours, tips and tricks, and shows like: Cody's Workshop with Cody Grivno, Drew's Trackside Adventures with Drew Halverson, Off The Rails with Gerry Leone, Ask MRVP with David Popp, Let's Make a Scene with Kathy Millatt, It's My Railroad with Steve Brown, Rehab My Railroad, History According to Hediger with Jim Hediger, The Hills Line with James McNabb, Tuck's Toy Trains with John Truckenbrod and many more. MRVP made its debut back in 2013 and is available to magazine subscribers.  Cultural impact  The model train hobbyists the magazine has profiled over the years include a number of celebrities, including Michael Gross and Rod Stewart. Model Railroader also has several other \\"sister\\" magazines, also published by Kalmbach, including such titles as Trains magazine, Classic Trains, Garden Railways, and Classic Toy Trains.

Owned by the Norfolk Southern Railway as part of its W Line, Saluda Grade in Polk County, North Carolina, gains in elevation in less than three miles between Melrose and Saluda. Average grade is 4.24 percent for and maximum is 4.9% for about . History Captain Charles W. Pearson was assigned to select a route for the Spartanburg and Asheville Railroad to ascend the Blue Ridge front; the area where the rolling hills of the Piedmont end at the foot of the Blue Ridge Mountains. Despite numerous surveys, no route was available for a railroad to ascend the mountains at a tolerable grade, and the best route followed the Pacolet River valley and gorge. The line begins its climb at the bottom of Melrose Mountain, where Tryon is today, at , and continues on the south side of the Pacolet valley. At Melrose, the Saluda Grade begins and climbs to the town of Saluda, cresting in the center of town at an elevation of . Because of accidents involving downgrade runaway trains in the late 1880s, the then Southern Railway built two runaway safety spur tracks. These were originally manned junctions, which were always switched to a pile of earth, which could stop downgrade runaway trains. Only upon hearing a whistle signal from the downgrade train would the signalman manning the spur junction throw the switch to keep the train on the main line. In later years, CTC signaling was installed along with automated switches and timer circuits for the one surviving runaway safety track at the bottom of the grade at Melrose. Trains running downgrade were required to maintain when approaching the runaway track switch. This would allow a timer circuit to determine if a train was under control, in which case the switch from the runaway track at Melrose would be aligned to the mainline. But for speed greater than the switch would remain aligned for the runaway track. Saluda Grade was one of the few grades in the country where uphill trains could travel faster than their downhill counterparts. Most uphill trains had to double or triple the grade, splitting the train into sections to be taken up the grade to Saluda one at a time and reassembled there for the rest of the trip to Asheville. Norfolk Southern suspended freight traffic between East Flat Rock, North Carolina and Landrum, South Carolina in December 2001, thus ceasing operations on the Saluda Grade. In April 2003, Norfolk Southern severed the line from the rest of its system by placing mounds of dirt over the tracks and disconnecting the rails at mile posts 26 and 45.http://www.polkcounty.org/saludagrade/the_saluda_grade.html The signal system is not in use, and grade crossings have had their arms removed and signals covered. Norfolk Southern has inspected and maintained the right-of-way since placing the segment out of service, removing fallen trees and spraying herbicide on encroaching vegetation, but at least four washouts of the roadbed have occurred between Saluda and South Carolina, rendering the line impassable. Talks of a passenger train excursion and a Rails-to-trails conversion have made no headway in recent years, and Norfolk Southern states it does not intend to abandon the line. However, in 2014, Norfolk Southern sold a portion of the W Line south of Asheville between mile posts 1 and 26 to Watco Companies, L.L.C., a Class III shortline railroad operator. Watco operates the line as the Blue Ridge Southern Railroad. Norfolk Southern still retains ownership of the out-of-service segment over the Saluda Grade. Since 2014, weed control spraying has stopped and kudzu has grown over the lower third of the grade.

It was manufactured in North America by Stern Electronics. The player controls \\"Mama,\\" a pig whose babies have been kidnapped by a group of wolves. Pooyan was ported to the Atari 2600, Atari 8-bit family, TRS-80 Color Computer, Commodore 64, Sord M5, MSX, Apple II, TRS-80, Tomy Tutor, PV-1000, and Famicom.  Gameplay  The player controls Mama Pig, whose babies have been kidnapped by a pack of wolves and who must rescue them using a bow and arrow and slabs of meat. Controls consist of a two-position up/down joystick, which moves an elevator in which Mama Pig rides; and a button, which fires arrows and throws meat. Each level consists of two rounds. In the first, wolves descend slowly from a high ledge using balloons, which the player must shoot in order to drop them to the ground. Any wolves who reach the ground safely will climb up a set of ladders behind the elevator and try to eat Mama Pig if she moves in front of them. During the second round, the wolves start on the ground and inflate balloons in order to ascend to a cliff on which a boulder is resting so they can push it toward the edge. Airborne wolves throw rocks in both rounds, trying to hit Mama Pig. In addition, the balloon carrying the last \\"boss\\" wolf of the second round must be shot several times in order to defeat him; if he reaches the cliff, the player must defeat additional enemies before facing the boss again. A slab of meat occasionally appears at the top of the elevator's range of motion. Picking it up allows the player to throw it, distracting any wolves on/near its trajectory and causing them to let go of their balloons and crash to the ground for bonus points. Stray balloons and dropped fruits can also be shot for extra points. After every second round, a bonus screen is played. The first such screen requires the player to defeat a group of wolves using only meat, while the second awards points for shooting fruits thrown by the wolves. These two screens alternate after each level. The player loses one life if Mama Pig is hit by a rock, eaten by a wolf on the ladders (first round only), or crushed by the boulder if too many wolves reach the cliff and push it over the edge (second round only). When all lives are lost, the game ends. When the game starts, \\"The Other Day I Met a Bear\\" can be heard during the opening scene (in which the wolves kidnap Mama's babies). The first stage theme bears a very slight resemblance to the main theme music from Frogger, another Konami arcade game. The song is a part of the Desecration Rag (An operatic Nightmare) by Felix Arndt, the portion that mimics the beginning of Anton√≠n Dvo≈ô√°k's Humoresque Opus 101 Number 7. After the second stage is cleared a second time, a part of \\"Oh! Susanna\\" can be heard. Legacy Pooyan is included on a compilation, Konami Arcade Classics, released on the PlayStation and in arcades with the title Konami 80's AC Special. An emulated version of the game was released in 2006 for PlayStation 2 in Japan as part of the Oretachi Geasen Zoku Sono-series. The Famicom port was released for the Virtual Console in Japan.https://www.nintendo.co.jp/wii/vc/vc_py/index.htmlhttps://www.nintendo.co.jp/titles/20010000009706 There is a series of extra ops in Metal Gear Solid: Peace Walker known as the \\"Pooyan Missions\\", which involves shooting Fulton surface-to-air recovery balloons carrying abducted soldiers off into the air.

Vel√°zquez was the songwriter and lyricist of many Spanish standard songs, such as \\"Amar y vivir\\" (\\"To Love and to Live\\"), \\"Verdad amarga\\" (\\"Bitter Truth\\"), \\"Franqueza\\", \\"Que seas feliz\\", \\"Abuela abuela\\", \\"Cachito\\", \\"Enamorada\\", and, most notably, the enduring 1940s-era standard \\"B√©same mucho\\", a romantic ballad which was soon recorded by artists around the globe, making it an international hit. The Beatles famously performed it as a part of their 1 January 1962 studio audition for Decca executives, at which Decca 'failed' them (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dg48JepkiRo). The song was inspired by the sight of seeing a couple kissing in the street. Vel√°zquez, who is said to have begun playing the piano at the age of four, started her professional career as a classical music concert pianist, performing at Palacio de Bellas Artes and XEQ Radio, but later became a singer and recording artist. According to Vel√°zquez herself, she was strongly influenced by Spanish composer Enrique Granados. Vel√°zquez also was elected to the Mexican Congress, she served as president for SACM (Society of Authors and Composers of Mexico), and she was vice-president of CISAC (International Confederation of Authors and Composers Societies). Personal Life Velazquez married Mariano Rivera Conde after a 6 year courtship. They had two sons, Mariano Rivera Vel√°zquez, Sergio Rivera Vel√°zquez. Death According to her obituary, she was 88 years old when she died in Mexico City, of respiratory problems, on January 22, 2005. Vel√°zquez had been in hospital since she suffered a fall in November 2004.  ‚ÄúB√©same mucho‚Äù (Kiss Me A Lot)  Her best known success is the iconic song ‚ÄúB√©same mucho‚Äù, a bolero she wrote when she was only 16 years old. This is the piece that gained her more recognition and introduction to the rest of her artwork. The song was created before Consuelo received her first kiss of love. After being recorded by the Spanish-Mexican baritone Emilio Tuero, in 1944 the famous American pianist and singer Nat \\"King\\" Cole made the first adaptation in English. From then on, it was performed by hundreds of artists around the world, such as Pedro Infante, Javier Solis, The Beatles, Pl√°cido Domingo, Frank Sinatra, Sammy Davis Jr., Luis Mariano (who made it popular in France), La Sonora Santanera International, Xavier Cugat and his Orchestra, The Ventures, Antonio Mach√≠n, Lucho Gatica, Vera Lynn, Andrea Bocelli, Filippa Giordano, Luis Miguel, Sara Montiel, Jos√© Carreras, Ray Conniff and his Orchestra, Diana Krall, Zo√©, Susana Zabaleta and Monica Naranjo among others. B√©same mucho is also known as Kiss Me Kiss Me Much, Kiss Me a Lot, Kiss Me Again and Again, Embrasse-Moi and Stale Ma Boskavaj. Translated into more than 20 languages, the song is nowadays an icon of popular music. Part of its great success in the United States was the contextualization of the song towards women who waited for their husbands during World War II.  Her life as a composer  As a composer her legacy has been most noteworthy. Her first compositions, Do not ever ask me, Pasional and Let me love you, were of a romantic nature. Then, among other songs such as B√©same mucho, Amar y vivir, Verdad Amarga, Franqueza, Chiqui, Cachito, Que seas feliz, Enamorada, Orgullosa y bonita and Yo no fui (dance song popularized initially by Pedro Infante and, in years recent, by Pedro Fern√°ndez). It is interesting to note Vel√°zquez' participation as an actress in the 1938 Argentine film Nights of Carnival 1, directed by the filmmaker Julio Saraceni. She also played a pianist in films of director Juli√°n Soler. She composed music for several Mexican films. Legacy In 2003, sculptor Sergio Peraza immortalized Vel√°zquez with a Mexico City statue.

It was distributed in the United States by Centuri. While engaging in aerial combat, the player-controlled jet flies across open airspace that scrolls indefinitely in all directions. Each level is themed to a different time period. Home ports for the Atari 2600, MSX, and ColecoVision were released in 1983. A top-down sequel, Time Pilot '84, was released in arcades in 1984. It drops the time travel motif and instead takes place over a futuristic landscape. Gameplay Players assume the role of a pilot of a futuristic fighter jet trying to rescue fellow pilots trapped in different time eras. In each level, players battle enemy aircraft and then a stronger aircraft. Players' fighter jet is in the center of the screen at all times. Players eventually battle a mothership of the time period they are in; once the mothership is defeated, they move onto the next time period. Parachuting pilots will occasionally appear and award players points if collected. There are five levels: 1910, 1940, 1970, 1982/1983, and 2000. After the fifth level is finished, the game repeats thereafter. Extra lives are given at 10,000 points, and per 50,000 scored up to 960,000; thereafter, game goes to \\"survival of the fittest\\" mode. Fighters are destroyed if they collide into bullets, enemy ships, or missiles. Game ends if last fighter is destroyed. Development According to his account, Yoshiki Okamoto's proposal for Time Pilot was initially rejected by his boss at Konami, who assigned Okamoto to work on a driving game instead. Okamoto secretly gave instructions to his programmer to work on his idea, while pretending to be working on a driving game in front of his boss.

It is subtitled ¬´ √Ä la m√©moire d‚Äôun grand artiste ¬ª - In memory of a great artist, in reference to Nikolai Rubinstein, his close friend and mentor, who had died on 23 March 1881. It is scored for piano, violin, and cello. The work's first version was completed by late January 1882. Private performances were held in March and April. The work underwent considerable revision before its premiere on 30 October at a quartet concert of the Russian Musical Society in Moscow. The players at the performance were Sergei Taneyev (piano), Jan H≈ô√≠mal√Ω (violin), and Wilhelm Fitzenhagen (cello). Movements The piece is marked by a tragic perspective and is in two movements: :I. Pezzo elegiaco (Moderato assai ‚Äì Allegro giusto) (in A minor) (approx 20:00) :II. (A) Tema con variazioni: Andante con moto (in E major) ‚Äì (B) Variazione finale e coda (in A major ‚Äì A minor) (approx 27:00) Total timing: approx. 47:00 The variations are as follows: :Var I :Var II: Pi√π mosso :Var III: Allegro moderato :Var IV: L'istesso tempo (Allegro moderato) :Var V: L'istesso tempo :Var VI: Tempo di Valse :Var VII: Allegro moderato :Var VIII: Fuga (Allegro moderato) :Var IX: Andante flebile, ma non tanto :Var X: Tempo di mazurka :Var XI: Moderato :Variazioni finale e coda: Allegro risoluto e con fuoco :Coda: Andante con moto ‚Äì Lugubre (L'istesso tempo) The Pezzo elegiaco is a darkly brooding and rather conventional romantic first movement with a beautiful opening cello solo with a theme that returns for a final funeral march. The second movement is rather more unusual: it opens with an almost classical melody, much like Tchaikovsky's Variations on a Rococo Theme for cello, and then proceeds with an assured set of variations, also like the Rococo Variations. After working itself into more and more ecstatic heights culminating with the final variation, it suddenly goes through a surprising modulation to the original minor key, and the theme from the first movement returns with an even greater gravity, and the entire piece concludes with yet another death march. The work, and the second movement in particular, is arguably the most difficult piece Tchaikovsky wrote for piano, whether solo, with orchestra, or in a chamber group. It remains popular, despite its length (it plays for more than 45 minutes), for its breathtaking lyricism and the cosmic finality of its final statement. Background This was the only work Tchaikovsky ever wrote for the combination of piano, violin, and cello. In 1880, his benefactress Nadezhda von Meck, had asked for such a piece, but he refused, saying in his letter to her of 5 November 1880: :You ask why I have never written a trio. Forgive me, dear friend; I would do anything to give you pleasure, but this is beyond me ... I simply cannot endure the combination of piano with violin or cello. To my mind the timbre of these instruments will not blend ... it is torture for me to have to listen to a string trio or a sonata of any kind for piano and strings. To my mind, the piano can be effective in only three situations: alone, in context with the orchestra, or as accompaniment, i.e., the background of a picture.Quoted in Mark A. Radice, Liner notes to the Eastman Trio's recording on Turnabout, TVC 37017 A year later, he composed the piano trio without being asked to do so, when any number of other genres or instrumental combinations were also available to him. In a letter to von Meck of 27 December 1881, he again referred to his \\"antipathy for this combination of instruments\\". He wrote: ... in spite of this antipathy, I am thinking of experimenting with this sort of music, which so far I have not touched. I have already written the start of a trio. Whether I shall finish it and whether it will come out successfully I do not know, but I would like very much to bring what I have begun to a successful conclusion ... I won't hide from you the great effort of will required to set down my musical ideas in this new and unusual form. But I should like to overcome all these difficulties....Tchaikovsky Research He completed his rough sketches on 20 January 1882, and completed the scoring by 25 January. On that day he wrote to von Meck again: The Trio is finished ... now I can say with some conviction that my work is not all bad. But I am afraid, having written all my life for orchestra, and only taken late in life to chamber music, I may have failed to adapt the instrumental combinations to my musical thoughts. In short, I fear I may have arranged music of a symphonic character as a trio, instead of writing directly for the instruments. I have tried to avoid this, but I am not sure whether I have been successful. He put the finishing touches to the Trio by 9 February (the score is annotated \\"Rome 28 January-9 February 1882\\"), and sent it to his publishers on 11 February, asking that Sergei Taneyev appear as piano soloist at the first performance. Taneyev, the cellist Wilhelm Fitzenhagen and the violinist Jan H≈ô√≠mal√Ω were given access to the score, and they made a number of suggestions for improvement, which Tchaikovsky accepted. A private performance with the above- named soloists was held at the Moscow Conservatory on 23 March, the first anniversary of Nikolai Rubinstein's death, while Tchaikovsky was in Italy. He returned to Russia in April and heard the Trio for the first time, at another private performance, after which he made revisions. These included inserting a break before the Andante coda and rewriting the piano part in the Finale. Taneyev also rewrote Variation VIII, a change Tchaikovsky approved. Notable performances The work was performed during Tchaikovsky's visit to the United States in 1891, at a reception for the composer at the Russian Embassy in Washington, D.C.Alexander Poznansky, Tchaikovsky: The Quest for the Inner Man, p. 534 Other uses Music from the second movement was used for John Taras' 1948 ballet Designs with Strings.

According to the 1999 Editor & Publisher International Yearbook, the Herald-Leader's paid circulation is the second largest in the Commonwealth of Kentucky. The newspaper has won the 1986 Pulitzer Prize for Investigative Reporting, the 1992 Pulitzer Prize for Editorial Writing and the 2000 Pulitzer Prize for Editorial Cartooning. It had also been a finalist in six other Pulitzer awards in the 22-year period up until its sale in 2006, a record that was unsurpassed by any mid-sized newspaper in the United States during the same time frame. History Former offices on Walnut Street The Herald-Leader was created by a 1983 merger of the Lexington Herald and the Lexington Leader. The story of the Herald begins in 1870 with a paper known as the Lexington Daily Press. In 1895, a descendant of that paper was first published as the Morning Herald, later to be renamed the Lexington Herald in 1905. Meanwhile, in 1888 a group of Fayette County Republicans began publication of a competing afternoon paper named the Kentucky Leader, which became known as the Lexington Leader in 1901. In 1937, the owner of the Leader, John Stoll, purchased the Herald. The papers continued as independent entities for 46 years. Despite the common ownership, the two papers had different editorial stances; the Herald was moderately liberal while the Leader was conservative. The two newspapers published a combined Sunday edition. In 1973, both were purchased by Knight Newspapers, which merged with Ridder Publications to form Knight Ridder the following year. A decade later, in 1983, the Herald and Leader merged to form today's Lexington Herald-Leader. In 1985, publisher Creed Black allowed reporters to publish a series of articles which exposed widespread corruption within the University of Kentucky's Wildcats men's basketball team. From 1979 to 1991, the paper was edited by John Carroll, who went on to edit The Baltimore Sun and the Los Angeles Times. On July 11, 2001, the paper reduced four positions due to declining advertising revenue and higher newsprint costs. Long-time columnists Don Edwards and Dick Burdette took voluntary early retirements but are still published occasionally as contributing writers. The job eliminations were a cumulation of efforts that started in May when the workforce was reduced by 15 positions. On July 4, 2004, the newspaper, in an effort to apologize for failing to cover the civil rights movement, published a front- page package of stories and archive photos documenting Lexingtonians involved in the movement. The stories, written by Linda B. Blackford and Linda Minch, received international attention, including a story on the front page of The New York Times. It also received an annual professional award by the Kentucky chapter of the Special Libraries Association. On June 27, 2006, the McClatchy Company purchased Knight Ridder for approximately $4 billion in cash and stock on June 27, 2006. It also assumed Knight Ridder debt of $2 billion. McClatchy sold 12 Knight Ridder papers, but the Herald-Leader was one of 20 retained. Office and production plant The Herald-Leaders new office and production plant facility was completed in September 1980 at a cost of $23 million.Mastiff, Bruce. \\"Outward Bound ‚Äì Landlocked Lexington Survives and Grows.\\" Kentucky Monthly 2.3 (1981).\\" It was a structure that featured 14 Goss Metro offset presses that had the capacity to produce 600,000 newspapers in a typical week. The plant is on a lot at the corner of East Main Street and Midland. The $23 million cost was divided into $7,804,000 for architecture, $750,000 for interiors and $8,500,000 for production equipment and presses. In June 2016, it was announced that the Herald-Leader would cease its printing operations in Lexington, passing that role to Louisville-based Gannett Publishing Services. As a result of the move, 25 full-time and 4 part-time employees would be laid-off. It was also announced that the plant would be put up for sale, with the Fayette County property valuation administrator assessing the property at $6.84 million for tax purposes. The first issue of the Louisville-printed Herald-Leader published on August 1, 2016. The last issue of the Lexington Herald-Leader to be printed in Lexington was printed on July 31, 2016. It marked the end of 229 years of newspaper printing in Lexington. The Herald-Leader building has been proposed as a new city hall for the Lexington-Fayette Urban County Government. Remaining staff will be relocated to a smaller office space upon the sale of the building.

Early life Saumarez was born at St Peter Port, Guernsey to an old island family, the eldest son of Matthew de Sausmarez (1718-1778) and his second wife Carteret, daughter of James Le Marchant. He was a nephew of John de Sausmarez (1706-1774) of Sausmarez Manor and the elder brother of General Sir Thomas Saumarez (1760-1845), Equerry and Groom of the Chamber to the Duke of Kent, and afterwards Commander-in-Chief of New BrunswickPriaulx LibraryDNBC biography of 1st Baron Seaton and of Richard Saumarez (1764-1835), a surgeon and medical author. Their sister married Henry Brock, the uncle of Major- General Sir Isaac Brock and Daniel de Lisle Brock. Many of de Sausmarez's ancestors had distinguished themselves in the naval service, and he entered it as midshipman at the age of thirteen. Upon joining the navy, he dropped the second 's' to become de Saumarez. Naval service =Early service in the Mediterranean and American Revolutionary War= In 1767, Saumarez was entered as a volunteer on the books of although he never set foot on the ship, studying at a school near London until in 1770, Saumarez joined the in the Mediterranean. Placed on board , he was rated midshipman in November 1770. A transfer to in February 1772 until she returned to Spithead in 1775 gave an opportunity to take his examination for lieutenant. In 1775, at the age of 18, Saumarez was ordered to Sir Peter Parker's flagship in North America. Saumarez distinguished himself under Parker, showing courage and being promoted to acting lieutenant at the July 1776 Battle of Sullivan's Island which required the Bristol to fire broadsides at Fort Sullivan. The engagement lasted 13 hours and 111 men were killed on the Bristol. Saumarez moved to as temporary 5th lieutenant. He received his first command, the tender Lady Parker. On promotion to lieutenant in 1778 he received his second command, the 8-gun galley . After 47 engagements, unfortunately he had to run Spitfire ashore and burn her on 30 July 1778 when a French fleet under Admiral d'Estaing arrived at Narrangansett Bay. Saumarez then served on land at the Battle of Rhode Island before returning to Portsmouth. Saumarez next served as third lieutenant on the Victory, under various admirals until it became Vice Admiral Hyde Parker's flagship, by which time he had moved up to 1st lieutenant. He moved with the Admiral to , on which he was present at the Battle of Dogger Bank on 5 August 1781, when he was wounded. He was promoted commander and appointed to the fireship Tisiphone. In 1782, Saumarez sailed his ship to the West Indies with despatches for Samuel Hood and arrived in time to witness the closing stages of Hood's operations at St Kitts on 25 January 1782. =Battle of the Saintes= While commanding (74 guns), Saumarez contributed to Rodney's victory over de Grasse at the Battle of the Saintes on (12 April 1782). During the battle and on his own initiative, Saumarez took his ship out of line to assist in the capture of De Grasse's flagship, Ville de Paris. This action prompted Admiral Rodney to remark that, \\"The Russell's captain is a fine fellow, whoever he is.\\" When the war in America was finished, Saumarez went ashore and did not go to sea again until 1793 when he was given command of the frigate , a 36-gun fifth rate frigate. =Action of 20 October 1793= It was in Crescent that Saumarez was involved in one of the first major single-ship actions of the war when he captured the French frigate Reunion, in the Action of 20 October 1793. British casualties were exceptionally light, with only one man wounded during the engagement. In reward, Saumarez was knighted by King George III and given a presentation plate by the City of London, although he later received a bill for ¬£103 6s 8d (the equivalent of ¬£9,700 as of 2011), from a Mr. Cooke for \\"the honour of a knighthood\\". Saumarez refused to pay, telling Cooke to charge whomever had paid for Edward Pellew's knighthood after his successful action. Saumarez later wrote to his brother that \\"I think it hard to pay so much for an honour which my services have been thought to deserve\\". =Channel Islands station= While in command of a Guernsey-based squadron consisting of three frigates, , and , a lugger, and cutter a planned invasion by 20,000 French soldiers of the Channel Islands scheduled for February 1794 was frustrated and cancelled due to Saumarez's vigilant eye. On 8 June 1794 on the way from Plymouth to Guernsey, he encountered a superior French force of two razees, three frigates, and a cutter. The French squadron outgunned the British by 192 guns to 92, but Saumarez succeeded in getting his frigates to safety by sailing between rocks on the west coast of Guernsey and around the island to the St Peter Port anchorage. The British lugger and cutter had returned to Plymouth before the start of the action. The British threat to any invasion force stayed intact. =Battle of Cape St Vincent= After being promoted in 1795, Saumarez was appointed to the 74-gun in the Channel fleet, where he took part in the defeat of the French fleet at the Battle of Groix off Lorient on 22 June. Orion was one of the ships sent to reinforce Sir John Jervis in February 1797, when Saumarez distinguished himself in the Battle of Cape St. Vincent. During the early stages he helped repel a sustained attack on the British line and covered the retreat of when she was forced to retire from the action. Colossus had sustained serious damage, her sails being virtually shot away and it looked as though she would be raked by Spanish warships, until Orion intervened. Later, when the engagement had turned to a general melee, Saumarez forced the Salvador del Mundo to surrender before attacking the Santissima Trinidad with the help of . Saumarez was certain he had forced her surrender too when the arrival of the remainder of the Spanish fleet forced Jervis to break off the engagement. =Blockade of Cadiz and the Battle of the Nile= Saumarez remained with Jervis's fleet and was present at the blockade of Cadiz from February 1797 to April 1798. In May 1798, the Orion joined the squadron under Nelson's command that was sent into the Mediterranean to seek and destroy the French. Saumarez was Nelson's second in command at the Battle of the Nile where he distinguished himself once more, forcing the surrender of the Peuple Souverain and the 80-gun Franklin. =Battle of Algeciras and Gut of Gibraltar= James Saumarez's squadron preparing to pursue the combined Squadron of France & Spain, on the Afternoon of 12 July 1801 On his return from Egypt, Saumarez received the command of , of 80 guns, with orders to watch the French fleet off Brest during the winters of 1799 and 1800. In 1801, he was promoted to the rank of Rear-Admiral of the Blue, was created a baronet, and received the command of a small squadron which was to watch the movements of the Spanish fleet at Cadiz. Between 6 and 12 July, he performed an excellent piece of service, in which after a first repulse at Algeciras he routed a much superior combined force of French and Spanish ships at the Battle of the Gut of Gibraltar. For his services, Saumarez received the Order of the Bath and the Freedom of the City of London. In 1803, the United Kingdom Parliament bestowed upon him an annuity of ¬£1200 a year (Annuity to Admiral Saumarez Act 1803). During the Peace of Amiens, 1802-3 Saumarez remained at home with his family in Guernsey, and when war broke out again he was given command of the naval forces defending the Channel Islands. He therefore was not present at the 1805 Battle of Trafalgar. =The Baltic Campaign= In 1808, Saumarez was given command of the Baltic fleet with his flag in . Saumarez's mission was to protect the British trade which was of vital importance for Royal Navy supplies and to blockade enemy ports such as those under French control in northern Germany. The Russian fleet was also kept under blockade until Alexander I reopened Russian ports. Sweden, under pressure from France, declared war on Britain in November 1810 but Saumarez showed conspicuous tact towards the government of Sweden and her shipping, correctly guessing that the Swedes, like their Russian neighbours, would eventually defy Napoleon. Charles XIII later bestowed on him the Grand Cross of the military Order of the Sword. Denmark, a French satellite, also needed to be kept under observation until it was invaded by the Swedish Army in 1814. In 1812 Napoleon invaded Russia with half a million troops and Saumarez's fleet was instrumental in hampering French operations. =Latter years= At the Peace of 1814, Saumarez attained the rank of admiral, and in 1819 he was made Rear-Admiral of the United Kingdom, in 1821 Vice-Admiral of the United Kingdom. From 1824 to 1827 he was Commander-in-Chief, Plymouth. He was raised to the peerage as Baron de Saumarez in 1831 and died in Guernsey in 1836. In memory of Saumarez's achievements, there is a statue of him in the National Maritime Museum in London. The public bar at the Duke of Normandie Hotel in Saint Peter Port was named after Saumarez and features a portrait of him. =Relationship with Nelson= Saumarez and Nelson served together in 1797 and 1798, but their relationship was not a close one. In fact on a number of occasions it became quite strained. They first clashed after the Battle of Cape St Vincent. Saumarez had forced the surrender of the Santissima Trinidad but was unable to capture her because Jervis was forced to break off the engagement. Nelson attempted to console Saumarez by telling him that the Spanish had confirmed that the Trinidad had indeed surrendered. Saumarez tersely replied \\"Whoever doubted it, sir? I hope there is no need for such evidence to establish the truth of a report of a British officer.\\" In May 1798, when Saumarez was appointed to Nelson's squadron in the Mediterranean, Nelson preferred to confer with Troubridge and even though, as the senior captain, Saumarez was technically second in command, he was often left out of their conversations. After the Battle of the Nile, while in conversation with Nelson, on the quarterdeck of HMS Vanguard, Saumarez suggested that the tactic of doubling the French line had been a dangerous one as it exposed British ships to 'friendly fire'. Before he had a chance to explain, Nelson cut him short and angrily went below. Nelson decided that Saumarez should escort the prizes home, and they never served together again. Later Nelson wrote a letter saying, \\"I could have formed no opinion of Orion that was not favourable to her gallant and excellent commander (Saumarez) and crew\\". However, the awkwardness between them remained. Family In 1788, Saumarez married Martha le Marchant (d. 1849) of a wealthy Guernsey family, who brought the estate now known as Saumarez Park into the marriage. They had three sons and four daughters: The eldest, James (1789‚Äì1863), succeeded to the peerage, was a clergyman and died without children; he was succeeded in the peerage by his brother, John St. Vincent Saumarez (1806‚Äì1891). Appearances in naval fiction Saumarez appears as a minor character in C. S. Forester's Hornblower novel The Happy Return as a rear-admiral and is mentioned again in the later Hornblower novel The Commodore as the admiral soon to be commanding in the Baltic. Saumerez appears as admiral of the Gibraltar Squadron in Master and Commander and also as admiral of the Baltic Fleet in The Surgeon's Mate, books from Patrick O'Brian's Aubrey‚ÄìMaturin series. In Treachery (2008) (US title The Privateer's Revenge) by Julian Stockwin, Saumerez' purported orders (actually a forgery) result in the disgrace of Thomas Kydd. Saumarez returns as commander of the Baltic Fleet in The Baltic Prize (2017).

He was the younger brother of Anton Rubinstein and a close friend of Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky. Life Born to Jewish parents in Moscow, where his father had just opened a small factory, Rubinstein showed talent at the keyboard early on. He studied piano first with his mother, and while the family was in Berlin between 1844 and 1846, he studied piano with Theodor Kullak and harmony and counterpoint with Siegfried Dehn; during this time both he and his brother Anton attracted the interest and support of Mendelssohn and Meyerbeer. When the family returned to Moscow, Nikolai studied with Alexander Villoing, who also toured with him. He studied medicine to avoid army conscription, graduating from Moscow University in 1855. Brothers Rubinstein: Nikolai and Anton, (1862) As a result of his playing, Rubinstein was welcomed in all the fashionable artistocratic houses in Moscow. He co-founded the Moscow branch of the Russian Musical Society in 1859 and the Moscow Conservatory in 1866 with Prince Nikolai Petrovitch Troubetzkoy, serving as director of the latter until his death in 1881. He hired Tchaikovsky, then newly graduated from the Saint Petersburg Conservatory, to teach harmony at Moscow Conservatory. He actively encouraged Tchaikovsky's creative efforts and performed his compositions. Rubinstein and Tchaikovsky had a well-known falling-out over the latter's First Piano Concerto, but Rubinstein later revised his position and became an ardent champion of the work. Rubinstein conducted the premiere of Tchaikovsky's opera Eugene Onegin in 1879. Tchaikovsky wrote his Piano Trio in A minor in Rubinstein's memory after he died from tuberculosisNikolay Rubinstein. Tchaikovsky Research in Paris. Rubinstein also conducted and performed music of the nationalistic music group \\"The Five\\" to a much greater degree than his brother. In 1869, when the group's leader, Mily Balakirev, was forced to resign as conductor of the St. Petersburg branch of the Russian Musical Society, Rubinstein gave Balakirev his support, playing at concerts of the Free Music School as Balakirev's guest.Maes, 45. He also gave the first performance of Balakirev's piano work Islamey, the work for which he is best known today. Pianism Nikolai Rubinstein was generally regarded as one of the greatest pianists of his time, although now his reputation is overshadowed by that of his brother Anton. His pianistic style was quite at odds with that of his fiery brother. He instead opted for a restrained classicism more in line with the musical values of Clara Schumann than Franz Liszt. Edward Garden writes in the New Grove (2001), \\"His performances emphasized salient details of the structure of a piece and revealed great clarity of detail.\\"Garden, New Grove (2001), 21:850. According to Harold C. Schonberg, Anton Rubinstein is reported to have said that \\"if Nikolai had really worked on it, he could have been the better pianist of the two.\\"Schonberg, 279. One of Nikolai's pupils, Emil von Sauer, wrote a comparison of the two brothers' playing styles in 1895: > It is difficult to say which was the better pianist. In every way as > different as the brothers were in personal appearance‚Äîthe one dark, almost > to blackness; the other very fair ‚Äî so different was their playing. The > playing of Nicholas was more like that of Tausig, only warmer and more > impulsive. Perhaps Anton Rubinstein was the more inspired player of the two, > but he was unequal. Nicholas never varied; his playing both in private and > in public was always the same, and he kept up the same standard of > excellence.As quoted in Schonberg, 279. Students Nikolai Rubinstein's best-known piano students were Sergei Taneyev, Emil von Sauer and Alexander Siloti. Sauer and Siloti went on to study under Franz Liszt.Schonberg, 317, 323‚Äî324. His other notable pupils included Ernst Jedliczka and Henryk Pachulski. As a composer Grave of Nikolai Rubinstein in Novodevichy Cemetery, Moscow. Rubinstein was also a composer of some note, though Garden dismisses his music as \\"unimportant. Among his most popular works is his Tarantella in G minor and his Fantasia on a Theme by Schumann, both for piano solo. When asked why he did not compose more than he did, he replied that his brother Anton \\"composed enough for three.\\"As quoted in Garden, New Grove (2001), 21:850.

The village falls within the Rockingham Ward of the Barnsley Metropolitan Council. Neighbouring villages include Worsbrough, Tankersley and Hoyland Common. The A61 (Sheffield Road) passes north-south through the length of Birdwell, and at the southern end is Birdwell Roundabout which is the junction between the M1 motorway at Junction 36 and the A61. The roundabout also marks the start of the Dearne Valley Parkway, a relatively new dual carriageway which links the M1 at Junction 36 to the A1 at Marr (near Doncaster). Birdwell is run under the auspices of Barnsley Metropolitan Borough Council.  History  The origins of the village of Birdwell date back to the time of the English Civil War, around 1642, when the village name is first mentioned. In the years following the Second World War, open cast mining took place on much of the land to the northern end of Birdwell, and in some areas the remains of the quarries can still be found. Much of the land was subsequently restored to agriculture, mainly pasture with a little low key arable production and since the 1970s was owned by a local farming company. A small pocket of woodland called Parkinson Spring survived the mining activity and whilst little is known of its history, the name 'spring' could infer it was coppiced for the production of spring wood. The predominantly ancient woodlands of Miller Hill and Wigfield Wood are thought to be remnants of the once extensive woodland of the Wortley Park estate, an area through which the M1 motorway was subsequently built. Hangmanstone Depot was the site of Allan Finlay's diesel engine export company Hartwood Exports, where a great number of UK buses and other commercial vehicles ended their lives. Birdwell & Hoyland Common railway station, was a railway station on the South Yorkshire Railway's Blackburn Valley Line between Westwood and High Royds. The station was intended to serve Birdwell, Pilley and Hoyland Common, although the original chosen site was moved half a mile nearer towards Barnsley to serve the purposes of the Earl of Wharncliffe who was, at that time, sinking Wharncliffe Silkstone Colliery nearby. This move away made the station less convenient for most of the population. The station was opened in February 1855, the building having an ornate canopy over its entrance and containing a private waiting room for use by the Earl of Wharncliffe. The station was closed on 7 December 1953.  Landmarks  * Birdwell Club is a former working men's club located on Sheffield Road.

In some areas‚Äîsuch as Philadelphia and along the Ohio River and Mississippi River‚Äîthe local game was called Town Ball. In other regions the local game was named \\"base\\", \\"round ball\\", \\"base ball\\", or just \\"ball\\"; after the development of the \\"New York game\\" in the 1840s it was sometimes distinguished as the \\"New England game\\" or \\"Massachusetts baseball\\". The players might be schoolboys in a pasture with improvised balls and bats, or young men in organized clubs. As baseball became dominant, town ball became a casual term to describe old fashioned or rural games similar to baseball. Rules The rules of town ball varied, but distinguishing characteristics most often cited were: * The number of players on a team was usually more than nine. * There was no foul territory; all struck balls were in play. * In many versions, base runners could be put out by hitting them with the ball‚Äîa practice known as \\"soaking\\" or \\"plugging.\\" Generally the infield was a square or rectangular shape, with four bases or pegs. Similarly to baseball, the fourth base was called home base, as it was the final goal of a runner. However, differently from baseball‚Äîand more like English rounders‚Äîthe striker would stand between first and fourth base, at a kind of fifth base called the striker's stand. The thrower stood in the middle of the square and delivered the ball to be hit by the striker. If the struck ball were caught in mid-air or on the first bounce, the striker was called out. If no one caught it, the striker became a runner and advanced as many bases as possible, with the option to stop at any base as a safe haven. In most varieties of the game, fielders could hit the runner with the ball and if he were not on a base he would be called out. But in some, the cross-out was used: the fielder threw the ball so as to cross the runner's path, between him and the next base. A runner who reached fourth base safely was said to have achieved a round or tally. The concept of innings was used: the team with the bat was \\"in\\", until put \\"out\\" by the opposing side. If one-out, all-out was the rule, the defensive team only needed to retire one man to end the inning. However, the game might also be played as all-out, all-out, meaning that every player had to be retired (as in cricket) before sides were changed. Matches might be played for an agreed-upon number of innings, or until one side had achieved a requisite number of tallies. Town ball and the Doubleday myth Townball's role in the origins of baseball has been debated since the early 1900s, and the two sides of the debate stem from a friendly quarrel between an editor and his publisher. In the 1903 edition of Spalding's Official Base Ball Guide, editor Henry Chadwick, who was born in England, wrote \\"Just as the New York game was improved townball, so was townball an improved form of the two- centuries-old English game of rounders.\\" Albert Goodwill Spalding, star player, sports equipment entrepreneur, and publisher of the Spalding Guide, asserted that baseball's origins were American. Spalding wrote an article titled \\"The Origin and Early History of Baseball\\" for the January 15, 1905 Washington Post. He described the game of Four Old Cat, in which four throwers and four batsmen stand in four corners. \\"Some ingenious American lad\\" got the idea of placing one thrower in the center of the square, wrote Spalding. \\"This was for many years known as the old game of Town Ball, from which the present game of baseball no doubt had its origin, and not from the English children's picnic game of 'Rounders'.\\" Later, in 1905, Spalding organized a panel of experts known as the Mills Commission to investigate the issue. Abner Graves, whose testimony was the basis of the Mills Commission claim that Abner Doubleday invented baseball in 1839, named townball as the \\"old\\" game that the boys of Cooperstown, New York played before baseball. In the townball game that Graves described, the batsman struck the tossed ball with a flat bat, and ran toward a goal fifty feet away, and back again. Graves said there were generally twenty to fifty boys in the field, which generated many collisions among those trying to catch the ball. Philadelphia town ball Most accounts of a game called town ball were recorded many years later as reminiscences or memoirs. It is more difficult to find contemporary descriptions. One of the earliest was a New York Clipper article dated September 19, 1857, reporting a \\"Game of Town Ball\\" at Germantown (now a neighborhood of Philadelphia). Reporting another game, the Clipper for August 11, 1860, commented, \\"The Olympic Club dates its existence back to 1832, so that properly speaking it is the parent Town Ball organization in the city of Philadelphia.\\" Informal groups were playing town ball at Market Street in Philadelphia and across the Delaware River in Camden, New Jersey, in 1831 and 1832. Irving Leitner quotes a 19th-century source: \\"All the players were over 25 years of age, and to see them playing a game like this caused much merriment among the friends of the players. It required 'sand' in those days to go out on the field and play, as the prejudice against the game was very great.\\" The two groups merged in 1833 to form the Olympic Ball Club. In the introduction to his book Baseball, John Montgomery Ward wrote of the Philadelphia game: A copy of the Olympic Ball Club's constitution exists, but it contains only rules for governing the club, and no rules for playing ball. Contemporary accounts describe Philadelphia town ball as played with eleven men on a side, with four bases and the batter standing between 4th and 1st bases. They played two innings of all-out, all- out or eleven innings of one-out, all-out. Typical games were high-scoring with the victorious side often topping 75 runs. The players are said to have made their own bats and balls. They were adept with two types of bats. For a two-handed swing, a flat cricket-type bat was used. For a one-handed swing, a smaller round model, called a delill, was chosen. There is evidence that over the course of three decades the Olympics played varieties of baseball, wicket, and old cat, as well as town ball. In Philadelphia Town Ball, \\"every at bat resulted in a home run or an out\\". The bases were very close together, and were not safe havens, serving merely to mark the circuit the batter-runner must take. \\"Soaking\\" was permitted but rare. In 1860 the Olympics converted to the modern \\"New York game\\", but the old style was still being played in rural areas. That year members of Athletic of Philadelphia ‚Äî originally formed as a town ball club ‚Äî traveled to Mauch Chunk, Pennsylvania, for two contests, one of New York-style baseball and the other of town ball. The Mauch Chunk team defeated the A's, 45‚Äì43, at town ball. But playing New York rules, the A's defeated the country players, 34‚Äì2. The Athletics were soon to be a national baseball powerhouse. The Olympic Club, after a bitterly publicized rivalry with the A's, dropped out of major match play in 1864, and many of the members went back to playing town ball. Town ball in the west * In Cincinnati, Ohio the informal Excelsior Townball Club was formed in 1860; the players were young schoolteachers and their friends, and hospital interns. Reportedly they used a small bat which was swung with one hand, in games of four innings, with 10 to 15 players on a side. The more formal Cincinnati Buckeye Townball Club was established in 1863. * Indiana Author Edward Eggleston remembers a pre- Civil War schoolyard game: * The town of Canton, Illinois was incorporated in 1837. At the first meeting of the town trustees (aldermen), March 27, 1837, Section 36 of the Ordinances was enacted: \\"any person who shall on the Sabbath day play at bandy, cricket, cat, town-ball, corner-ball, over-ball, fives, or any other game of ball, within the limits of the corporation, or shall engage in pitching dollars or quarters, or any other game, in any public place, shall, on conviction thereof, be fined the sum of one dollar.\\" * Henry J. Philpott described himself as \\"a pupil and teacher in country schools within twenty miles of the Mississippi River, and about half-way between St. Louis and St. Paul.\\" He wrote a story called \\"A Little Boys' Game with a Ball\\" for Popular Science Monthly in 1890. Philpott writes that the boys played Old Cat until they had more than eight players; then they switched to town-ball. \\"In 'town-ball' there was as yet no distinction between base-men [infielders] and fielders. After the pitcher and catcher had been selected, the others on that side went where they pleased; and they did not get to bat until they had put all the batters out.\\" He writes that after baseball was introduced, town-ball \\"was so different that for some years the two games were played side by side, each retaining its own name.\\" The Massachusetts Game New Englanders usually called their game \\"base\\" or \\"round ball\\" (from running 'round the bases). The \\"Massachusetts game\\" or \\"New England game\\" was a formalized version with many clubs active in the Boston area. A set of rules was drawn up by the Massachusetts Association of Base Ball Players at Dedham, Massachusetts in 1858. This game was played by ten to fourteen players with four bases 60 feet apart and no foul territory. The ball was considerably smaller and lighter than a modern baseball, and runners were put out by \\"soaking\\"‚Äîhitting them with the thrown ball. Innings were one-out, all-out and the first club to reach 100 runs was the winner. Although it had its adherents until the 1860s, the Massachusetts game was superseded by the three-out, all-out \\"New York game\\" of baseball, with its Knickerbocker Rules which formed the basis of the modern game of baseball. Old-fashioned base ball Another term applied retroactively to precursor baseball games was \\"old-fashioned base ball\\". This game was generally identified as a type of baseball with large numbers on each side, where the fielders threw the ball at the runner. The Knickerbocker Antiquarian Base Ball Club of Newark, New Jersey continued to play old- fashioned base ball at least until 1865. After the Civil War, old-timers still put on exhibitions of traditional baseball at picnics and charity events. For instance, in Mauston, Wisconsin in 1888, the festivities at The Old Settlers Jubilee included \\"an old-fashioned base ball game.\\"http://www.rootsweb.com/~wijuneau/Pioneers21888.html Ironically, the only mention of baseball in The Chronicles of Cooperstown describes an old- fashioned game: > 1877\\\\. A famous game of old-fashioned base ball was played here, in > August‚ÄîJudge Sturges heading the \\"Reds\\" and Judge Edick the \\"Blues\\"‚Äî16 on a > side. The victory was with the \\"Blues.\\" It called together a large concourse > of people. Many articles were written waxing nostalgically for the old game. This nostalgia was satirized by Robert J. Burdette in his story \\"Rollo Learning to Play\\": Varieties of town ball remained a popular schoolyard activity, especially in rural areas, well into the 20th century.http://home.comcast.net/~buffalohead/townball2.htm In recent times the Massachusetts Rules have occasionally been used by \\"vintage\\" baseball clubs, such as the Leatherstocking Base Ball Club of Cooperstown, New York. Famous town ball players =Abraham Lincoln= Project Protoball lists Abraham Lincoln as a player in the 1840s. According to biographer Albert Beveridge, \\"He joined with gusto in outdoor sports‚Äîfoot-races, jumping and hopping contests, town ball, wrestling.\\" In another Protoball reference, Henry C. Whitney, in Lincoln the Citizen writes of the future President in 1860: \\"During the settling on the convention Lincoln had been trying, in one way and another, to keep down the excitement ... playing billiards a little, town ball a little, and story-telling a little.\\" Irving Leitner quotes a story by Frank Blair, grandson of Francis P. Blair, one of Lincoln's political confidants: > There were eight or ten of us, our ages ranging from eight to twelve years. > Although I was but seven or eight years of age, Mr. Lincoln's visits were of > such importance to us boys as to leave a clear impression on my memory. He > drove out to the place quite frequently. We boys, for hours at a time played > 'town ball' on the vast lawn, and Mr. Lincoln would join ardently in the > sport. I remember vividly how he ran with the children; how long were his > strides, and how far his coat-tails stuck out behind, and how we tried to > hit him with the ball, as he ran the bases. He entered into the spirit of > the play as completely as any of us, and we invariably hailed his coming > with delight. =Ty Cobb= In his book My Life in Baseball, Ty Cobb wrote about ballplaying in Georgia around 1898: \\"At eleven and twelve, I liked to play cow-pasture baseball‚Äîwhat we called town ball.\\" He wrote of whacking a string ball and \\"then chasing madly about the bases while an opponent tried to retrieve said pill and sock you with it.\\" In this version of town ball, a home run entitled the hitter to another turn at bat.

It has been adapted for opera, film, radio and television. Plot Conradin, a sickly 10-year old boy, lives in the care of his despised, overbearing and controlling cousin Mrs De Ropp. He relies on his vivid imagination not only to keep him strong enough to survive, but also to serve as his escape from the real world. Rebelling against Mrs De Ropp's oppressive care, Conradin secretly cares for two animals in an unused garden shed: a hen, which he adores, and a polecat-ferret, which he fears and keeps locked in a hutch. Gradually, Conradin begins to venerate the ferret as a god, naming it Sredni Vashtar. He worships it weekly, bringing offerings of flowers and berries, and stolen nutmeg for special occasions. Mrs De Ropp grows concerned over Conradin's visits to the shed. She discovers the hen, and sells it. She announces the sale to Conradin, expecting a protest, but to her surprise the boy does not respond. But in secret, he changes his worshipping rituals and asks of his god an unnamed boon: \\"Do one thing for me, Sredni Vashtar\\". When Conradin's visits to the shed do not cease, Mrs De Ropp investigates further, and discovers the locked hutch. Suspecting guinea pigs, she ransacks his room, finds the key, and goes down to the shed, forbidding Conradin to leave the house. While she is gone, Conradin slowly begins to accept defeat, knowing that his god was not real and that his cousin will come out of the shed in triumph. But when Mrs De Ropp fails to reappear after some time, Conradin begins to chant a song of victory. Eventually he sees the ferret emerge from the shed, with dark wet stains around its jaws and throat. It passes out into the garden. A sour-faced maid announces tea and asks for Mrs De Ropp. Conradin tells her that she has gone to the shed, and makes himself a piece of buttered toast. As he enjoys his toast, there are screams from the maid, calls for help from the kitchen staff, and later the sound of something heavy being carried into the house. As voices discuss fervently who should break the news to the boy, Conradin calmly makes himself another piece of toast. Adaptations On September 15, 1941, an adaptation of \\"Sredni Vashtar\\" began the premier episode of the CBS Radio series The Orson Welles Show. Blanche Yurka portrayed Mrs. De Ropp, with Conrad Binyon as Conradin and Brenda Forbes as Matilda. \\"Sredni Vashtar\\" has been adapted as a chamber opera three times.

The orrery still exists and is the oldest functioning planetarium in the world. Biography Eise Jeltes Eisinga was born on 21 February 1744 in Dronrijp in the Dutch Republic. He was the son of Jelte Eises from Oosterlittens, a wool carder, and Hitje Steffens from Winsum. Although Eisinga was intellectually gifted, he was not allowed to go to school. When he was only 17 years old, he wrote a book about mathematics. When he was 17, he wrote another book about the principles of astronomy. Additional books about special subjects within the field of astronomy followed. Eisinga became a wool carder in Franeker, Netherlands. Through self-education he mastered mathematics and astronomy, which he also studied at the University of Franeker. At the age of 24, he married Pietje Jacobs (? ‚Äì 24 July 1788) and they had three children, one girl and two boys. *Trijntje (April 1773 ‚Äì 26 April 1773) *Jelte (29 May 1774 ‚Äì 31 March 1809) *Jacobus (17 March 1784 ‚Äì 24 March 1858) Due to a political crisis in 1787, Eisinga had to leave Friesland and went to Germany. Later he moved to Visvliet where he worked as a wool comber. He was banned from Friesland for five years and therefore stayed in Visvliet just across the border in Groningen. Meanwhile, his wife died, and on 27 May 1792, he married Trijntje Eelkes Sikkema (21 February 1764) in Visvliet. They had one son and two daughters. *Eelke (14 October 1793 ‚Äì 28 May 1795) *Hittje (16 February 1796 ‚Äì 8 May 1843) *Minke (4 June 1798 ‚Äì 17 July 1870) In 1795 he returned to Franeker. Eisinga remained a wool carder throughout his life, while running his planetarium with the help of public support, and occasionally guest lecturing at the University of Franeker, which Napoleon ordered closed in 1811. Eisinga died on 27 August 1828, at age 84, in Franeker. Orrery The orrery he built in his living room The orrery in Franeker On 8 May 1774 a conjunction of the moon and the planets Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter was forecast to appear. Reverend Eelco Alta, from Boazum, Netherlands, published a book in which he interpreted this as a return to the state of the planets at the day of creation and a likely occasion for Armageddon. Alta predicted that the planets and the moon would collide, with the result that the earth would be pushed out of its orbit and burned by the sun. Due to this prediction there was a lot of panic in Friesland. The canonical view holds that Eisinga decided to build an orrery in his living room to prove that there was no reason for panic. He expected to finish it within six months and eventually finished it in 1781, seven years after he started. During the same year, Uranus was discovered, but there was no room for this planet on the ceiling of his living room, where the orrery was located. However, recent research indicates that this chain of causality is dubious, not least because Eijsinga appears to have commenced construction before the publication of Alta's book.Huib J. Zuidervaart, Speculatie, wetenschap en vernuft. Fysica en astronomie volgens Wytze Foppes Dongjuma (1707-1778), instrumentmaker te Leeuwarden (Leeuwarden: Fryske Akademy, 1995). The construction of the orrery saved Eijsinga a lot of time, however, because he no longer needed to calculate the planets' respective positions by hand. On 30 June 1818, King William I of the Netherlands and Prince Frederik visited the orrery. King William I bought the orrery for the Dutch state. In 1859, the orrery was donated by the Dutch state to the city of Franeker. Recognition Eisinga was rewarded by becoming an honorary citizen of Franeker. The street of his planetarium was renamed \\"Eise Eisingastraat\\". On 5 May 1994 an 80-cent stamp was issued by the post office to celebrate his 250th birthday. In 2006 the planetarium was given permission to use the title \\"royal\\".

Description A thick slice of beef tenderloin A braised tenderloin of beef that has been seared in a heavy skillet on all 4 sides until browned, about 3 to 4 minutes per side. As with all quadrupeds, the tenderloin refers to the psoas major muscle ventral to the transverse processes of the lumbar vertebrae, near the kidneys. The tenderloin is an oblong shape spanning two primal cuts: the short loin (called the sirloin in Commonwealth countries) and the sirloin (called the rump in Commonwealth countries). The tenderloin sits beneath the ribs, next to the backbone. It has two ends: the butt and the \\"tail\\". The smaller, pointed end‚Äîthe \\"tail\\"‚Äîstarts a little past the ribs, growing in thickness until it ends in the \\"sirloin\\" primal cut, which is closer to the butt of the cow. This muscle does very little work, so it is the tenderest part of the beef. Processing and preparation Roast beef tenderloin Whole tenderloins are sold as either \\"unpeeled\\" (meaning the fat and silver skin remain), \\"peeled\\" (meaning that the fat is removed, but silver skin remains), or as PSMOs (\\"pismos\\"), which is short for peeled, silver skin removed, and side muscle (the \\"chain\\") left on. While the most expensive option pound-for-pound, PSMOs offer considerable savings over other tenderloin options as they require little handling by the chef, since the fat and trimmings have already been removed. Since it is the tenderest part of the animal, beef dishes requiring exceptionally tender meat, such as steak tartare, are ideally made from the tenderloin. Cuts The three main \\"cuts\\" of the tenderloin are the butt, the center-cut, and the tail. The butt end is usually suitable for carpaccio, as the eye can be quite large; cutting a whole tenderloin into steaks of equal weight will yield proportionally very thin steaks from the butt end. The center-cut is suitable for portion-controlled steaks, as the diameter of the eye remains relatively consistent. The center-cut can yield the traditional filet mignon or tenderloin steak, as well as the Chateaubriand steak and beef Wellington. The tail, which is generally unsuitable for steaks due to size inconsistency, can be used in recipes where small pieces of a tender cut are called for, such as beef Stroganoff.

Seares used astrophotography as part of Jacobus Kapteyn's effort to uncover the structure of the sidereal universe through research of \\"selected areas.\\" Seares standardized the stellar magnitude system and extended it beyond the 18th magnitude, using absorbing wire gauze screens and reduced apertures to compare stars of varying brightnesses. Seares also made contributions to the measurement and interpretation of stellar color indices and wrote on the brightness of the Milky Way compared to spiral nebulae, which were hypothesized (but not yet fully established) to be other galaxies. Seares also studied interstellar absorption and reddening of starlight. Seares died in 1964. The crater Seares on the Moon is named after him.

Scientific contributions In 1951 Salpeter suggested that stars could burn helium-4 into carbon-12 with the Triple-alpha process not directly, but through an intermediate metastable state of beryllium-8, which helped to explain the carbon production in stars. He later derived the initial mass function for the formation rates of stars of different mass in the Galaxy.

Irish folklore, when mentioned to many people, conjures up images of banshees, fairy stories, leprechauns and people gathering around, sharing stories. Many tales and legends were passed from generations to generations, so were the dances and song in the observing of important occasions such as weddings, wakes, birthday and holidays or, or handcraft traditions. All of the above can be considered as a part of folklore, as it is the study and appreciation of how people lived.  Definition  What constitutes Irish folklore may be rather fuzzy to those unfamiliar with Irish literature. Diarmuid √ì Gioll√°in, for one, declared that folklore was elusive to define clearly. Bo Almqvist (c. 1977) gave an all- encompassing definition that folklore covered \\"the totality of folk culture, spiritual and material\\", and included anything mentioned in Se√°n √ì S√∫illeabh√°in's A Handbook of Irish Folklore (1942)., cited by It was not until 1846 that the word \\"folklore\\" was coined, by English writer William Thoms, to designate \\"the manners, customs, observances, superstitions, ballads, proverbs, &c; of the olden time\\". The term was first translated into Irish as b√©aloideas (lit. 'oral instruction') in 1927. = Folktales and songs = Tales have been traditionally recounted in fireside gatherings, such social gatherings, in which traditional Irish music and dance are also performed, are labeled by some as the c√®ilidh, though this is a term borrowed from Scottish Gaelic. The story-telling, songs and dance were also part of how special occasions were commemorated, on such days as Christmas, Halloween (O√≠che Shamhna, eve of Samhain), Beltane, held on the first day of May, or St. Patrick's Day. Irish folklore is closely tied with the pipe and fiddle, the traditional Irish music and folk dance. The keening Caoineadh Airt U√≠ Laoghaire composed by Eileen Dubh N√≠ Chonaill in her husband's wake is a piece of poetry passed down by folk tradition. Other than folktales and legends, the folkloristic genres is complemented by memorates, beliefs, and belief statements., back cover = Handcraft and herb lore = Also part of Irish folklore are the handed-down skills, such as basket-weaving or St. Bridget's crosses. As an example, shallow wicker baskets called skeeoges as strainers (to empty the boiled potatoes and hot water on, to drain the liquid) were recorded in the Co. Wexford area by Patrick Kennedy in the 19th century. A later folklore collector was unable to ascertain whether this practice was carried out in the locality during the field work in the 1950s (or in the revisit in 1970's). This basket's name skeeoge supposedly derived from the Gaelic word for \\"shield\\" (). The Irish Folklore Commission has accumulated a collection of crosses made on St. Bridget's Day, and various craft objects made of plaited straw, etc., gathered from across the county. Folklore can also include knowledge and skills such as , or to treat an illness, i.e., herb lore.  Common themes  Bunworth Banshee, Fairy Legends and Traditions of the South of Ireland by Thomas Crofton Croker, 1825 There are certain stock motifs, often stereotypes, in Irish folklore. = Fairies = Fairy Trees near Greenan. According to fairy lore, the hawthorn tree, also known as a fairy tree, is said to mark the territory of the fairies. One commentator attributes to Andrew Lang the sweeping definition that Irish folklore is all about fairies. The belief in fairies (sidhe) has been widespread. One type of Irish fairy is the female banshee, the death-messenger with her keening, or baleful crying over someone's death, and known by many different names. Another well- recognized Irish fairy is the leprechaun, which the poet Yeats identifies as the maker of shoes. The cluricaune is a sprite many treat as synonymous to the lepreachaun, and Yeats muses on whether these and the far darrig (fear dearg, \\"red man\\") are the one and the same. Mackillop says these three are the three kinds solitary fairies, but Yeats goes on to say \\"there are other solitary fairies\\", naming the Dullahan (headless horsemen), P√∫ca, and so forth. The changeling is often ascribed to being perpetrated by fairies. The theme is assigned its own migratory legend type, \\"The Changeling\\" (ML 5085). = Fairy land = Supernatural beings such as these fairies named is also connected with the Irish traditional belief in the Otherworld (An Saol Eile). Fairy forts and hawthorn trees, also known as fairy trees, are the places of residency of fairies. To tamper with these sites is seen as hugely disrespectful to the fairies.  Hawthorn tree  There are several trees sacred to Ireland, but the lone hawthorn (aka the \\"may\\" tree) is particularly considered a fairy haunt, and patches underneath where the grass have worn down are reputed to be due to fairies dancing. Though literary fiction more than folklore, two consecutive poems by Samuel Ferguson, \\"The Fairy Thorn\\" and \\"The Fairy Well of Lagnanay\\" describes the lone Fairy Hawthorn (The Whitethorn).  Fairy mounds  The notion that Irish fairies live in fairy mounds (fairy forts, fairy hills) give rise to the names aos s√≠ or daoine s√≠dhe ('people of the sidhe [fairy mound] '). In the instance of \\"The Legend of Knockgrafton\\" (name of a hill), the protagonist named Lusmore is carried inside the fairy \\"moat\\" or rath by the fairy wind (). = Heroic sagas = Other classic themes in Irish folktale literature include C√∫ Chulainn, Children of Lir, Finn MacCool, from medieval heroic and tragic sagas. Folklore material in the 'Pre-Croker period', according to Bo Almqvist's reckoning, do tentatively include various Medieval written texts (the heroic tales in the Ulster Cycle, Finn Cycle, the Cycle of the Kings, and the hagiography of St. Patrick and other saints, etc.), with the proviso that these works can no longer be considered intact folk legends, given the accrued literary layers of the \\"fanciful and fantastic\\". However they are an excellent well-source of comparative study, as collected folktales are sometimes traceable to these medieval sagas. An example is the tale of C√∫ Chulainn's horse remnant in the legend type of \\"The Waterhorse as Workhorse\\" (MLSIT 4086), or so argued by C. W. von Sydow. In the 20th century, the Irish Folklore Commission collected a large corpus of such romantic heroic sagas, particularly the stories of Fionn Mac Cumhail and the Fianna.  History of collecting  = Early collectors = For most of the 19th century, collection of Irish folklore was undertaken by English-speakers, and the material collected were recorded only in English. Thomas Crofton Croker who compiled Fairy Legends and Traditions of the South of Ireland (1825‚Äì28) is considered one of the earliest collectors. Although Alspach's paper focused on the early works \\"contributing .. to the folklore background of the [Celtic] revival\\". Croker is the first among the significant \\"antiquary-folklorists\\" (the label applied by Richard Dorson) to emerge from mere antiquarians. = Tales in the Irish language = The Irish-speaking West, the Gaeltacht included for example the Aran Islands, where some folklore-collecting was performed by Danish linguist Holger Pedersen back in 1896, though the resulting collection was never published until a century later. The playwright J. M. Synge also included a couple of folktales in his The Aran Islands (1907). = Irish Folklore Commission = S√©amus √ì Duilearga (James Hamilton Delargy), who founded the Folklore of Ireland Society and its B√©aloideas magazine in 1927, was later appointed to head the Irish Folklore Commission (IFC) in established by the Irish government in 1935. Se√°n √ì S√∫illeabh√°in was the archivist for the IFC since its inception. After having undergone 3 month tutelage in Uppsala, Sweden under C. W. von Sydow on the methods of folklore archiving, the archivist became instrumental in establishing collecting policies for the IFC. One of √ì S√∫illeabh√°in's projects was the Schools' Scheme for primary school children to collect folklore (1937-1938). IFC established a network of 200 or 300 correspondents all over Ireland to whom long questionnaires were sent out to task them with particular areas of folklore collecting. √ì S√∫illeabh√°in soon compiled a how-tow guidebook for folklore-collecting fieldwork, entitled L√°imh-Leabhar B√©aloideasa (1937) in Irish, later expanded and published in English as A Handbook of Irish Folklore (1942). The methodology was based on the Uppsala system he studied, and the books became the standard bible for any Irish folklore collector. = Folktale classification = An effort to catalogue all the known international folk tales in Ireland, either in print or in oral circulation (as of 1956) was mounted by Se√°n √ì S√∫illeabh√°in and Reidar Thoralf Christiansen, culminating in The Types of the Irish Folktale (1963), a compilation of some 43,000 versions under 700 international tales. Christiansen was the creator of the index of Norwegian migratory legends (ML index), and Bo Almqvist adapted this for Irish legends, calling it MLSIT (for Migratory Legend Suggested Irish Type). Although The Types of the Irish Folktale purportedly deals with folktale but not folk legend, there are found to be some intersections between these comparative study apparatuses.  Sociological trends  Folklore is a part of national identity, and its meaning has evolving through time. = Irish identity= In Ireland the word Folk Lore has deep meaning to its people and brings societies together, it is a word that has ideological significance in this country. To put it succinctly, folklore is an important part of the national identity., quoting Lady Wilde, Ancient Legends, Mystic Charms, and Superstitions of Ireland, : \\"the legends have a peculiar and special value as coming direct from the national heart\\". = Effects of Christianity on Irish folklore = When Christianity was first brought in Ireland during the 5th century by missionaries, they were not able to totally wipe out the pre- existing folklore and beliefs in God-like fairies. But folklore did not remain untouched, and the myths and Christian beliefs were combined such that Irish folklore would ‚Äúenforce Christian ideals but still remain as a concession to early fairy belief systems‚Äù. Christianity altered the importance of some beliefs and define a new place for them in folklore. For example, fairies, who were previously perceived as God, became merely magical, and of much lesser importance. Along with it, a fusion of folklore legends and Christianity was witnessed. One of the major example of this is the existence of legends featuring both Saint Patrick, a central figure in the Irish church, and fairies (for example, ‚ÄúThe Colloquy of the Ancients‚Äù is a dialogue between Saint Patrick and the ghost of Caeilte of the Fianna, an ancient clan of Celtic warriors). All in all, the current Irish folklore shows a strong absorption of Christianity, including its lesson of morality and spiritual beliefs, creating a ‚Äúsingular brand of fairy tale tradition‚Äù. = English colonization = During the 16th century, the English conquest overthrew the traditional political and religious autonomy of the country. = Great Famine = The Great famine of the 1840s, and the deaths and emigration it brought, weakened a still powerful Gaelic culture, especially within the rural proletariat, which was at the time the most traditional social grouping. At the time, intellectuals such as Sir William Wilde expressed concerns on the decay of traditional beliefs: = Modern society = Moreover, in the last decades, capitalism has helped overcoming special spatial barriers making it easier for cultures to merge into one another (such as the amalgam between Samhain and Halloween). All those events have led to a massive decline of native learned Gaelic traditions and Irish language, and with Irish tradition being mainly an oral tradition, this has led to a loss of identity and historical continuity, in a similar nature to Durkheim's anomie.  Folk History  Irish folklore is replete with oral traditions that pertain to historical subjects. This was recognised in Se√°n √ì S√∫illeabh√°in's A Handbook of Irish Folklore, which includes a chapter specifically dedicated to collecting \\"Historical Tradition\\". Irish folk history was commonly known by the name seanchas, a term defined by S√©amus √ì Duilearga as ‚Äúorally preserved social-historical tradition.‚Äù When conducting fieldwork in county Fermanagh, the American folklorist Henry Glassie, a pioneer in the study of folk history, observed that in Irish storytelling ‚Äúhistory is a topic for conversation‚Äù. In his prize-winning works on the memory of the Irish Rebellion of 1798, the Israeli historian Guy Beiner has written in-depth case studies of folk history, powerfully demonstrating the value of folklore for the study of social and cultural history. Beiner has advocated for use of the term \\"vernacular historiography\\", which he argues \\"consciously steers clear of the artificial divides between oral and literary cultures that lie at the heart of conceptualizations of oral tradition\\" and also allows for the inclusion of folklife sources found in ethnological studies of material and visual culture.  In popular culture  Finnish folklorist Lauri Honko has referred to the re-contexted exploitation of folklore as its ‚Äúsecond life‚Äù. Irish folklore material is now being used in marketing (with strategies suggesting tradition and authenticity for goods), movies and TV shows (The Secret of Kells, mention of the Banshee are found in TV shows such as Supernatural, Teen Wolf or Charmed), books (the book series The Secrets of the Immortal Nicholas Flamel, the novel American Gods...), contributing to the creation of a new body of Irish folklore.

It is one of the most elaborate, and certainly the most studied, of all Australian Aboriginal sign languages. Social context While many neighbouring language groups such as Arrernte and the Western Desert Language have auxiliary sign languages, Warlpiri Sign Language, along with Warumungu Sign Language, appears to be the most well developed and widely used ‚Äî it is as complete a system of communication as spoken Warlpiri. This is possibly due to the tradition that widows should not speak during an extended mourning period which can last for months or even years; during this time they communicate solely by sign language. In Warlpiri communities, widows also tend to live away from their families, with other widows or young single women. As a result, it is typical for Warlpiri women to have a better command of the sign language than men, and among older women at Yuendumu, Warlpiri Sign Language is in constant use, whether they are under a speech ban or not.Dail- Jones, M. A. (1984). A Culture in Motion: A Study of the Interrelationship of Dancing, Sorrowing, Hunting and Fighting as Performed by the Warlpiri Women of Central Australia. M.A. Thesis, University of Hawaii, Honolulu. However, all members of the community understand it, and may sign in situations where speech is undesirable, such as while hunting, in private communication, across distances, while ill, or for subjects that require a special reverence or respect. Many also use signs as an accompaniment to speech. Linguistics British linguist Adam Kendon (1988) argues that Warlpiri Sign Language is best understood as a manual representation of the spoken Warlpiri language (a manually coded language), rather than as a separate language; individual signs represent morphemes from spoken Warlpiri, which are expressed in the same word order as the oral language. However, \\"markers of case relations, tense, and cliticised pronouns are not signed.\\" Some spatial grammatical features are present which do not exist in spoken Warlpiri, though spoken Warlpiri incorporates directionals in its verbs, and in such cases sign corresponds to speech.

He is widely regarded as one of the world's leading theoretical cosmologists in the period since 1970, with major theoretical contributions to primordial nucleosynthesis, dark matter, the cosmic microwave background, and structure formation. Peebles was awarded half of the Nobel Prize in Physics in 2019 for his theoretical discoveries in physical cosmology. He shared the prize with Michel Mayor and Didier Queloz for their discovery of an exoplanet orbiting a sun-like star. In his award presentation, Peebles noted that he does not prefer the term \\"Big Bang Theory\\", since \\"it connotes the notion of an event and a position, both of which are quite wrong.\\" While much of his work relates to the development of the universe from its first few seconds, he is more skeptical about what we can know about the very beginning, and stated, \\"It's very unfortunate that one thinks of the beginning whereas in fact, we have no good theory of such a thing as the beginning.\\" Peebles has described himself as a convinced agnostic.  Early life  Peebles was born on April 25, 1935 in St. Boniface, in present-day Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada, the son of Ada Marion (Green), a homemaker, and Andrew Charles Peebles, who worked for the Winnipeg Grain Exchange. He completed his bachelor of science at the University of Manitoba. He then went on to pursue graduate studies at Princeton University, where he received his Ph.D. in physics in 1962, completing a doctoral dissertation titled \\"Observational Tests and Theoretical Problems Relating to the Conjecture That the Strength of the Electromagnetic Interaction May Be Variable\\" under the supervision of Robert Dicke. He remained at Princeton for his whole career. Peebles was a Member in the School of Natural Sciences at the Institute for Advanced Study during the academic year 1977‚Äì78; he made subsequent visits during 1990‚Äì91 and 1998‚Äì99. Academic career Most of Peebles' work since 1964 has been in the field of physical cosmology to determine the origins of the universe. In 1964, there was very little interest in this field and it was considered a \\"dead end\\" but Peebles remained committed to studying it. Peebles has made many important contributions to the Big Bang model. With Dicke and others (nearly two decades after George Gamow, Ralph A. Alpher and Robert C. Herman), Peebles predicted the cosmic microwave background radiation. Along with making major contributions to Big Bang nucleosynthesis, dark matter, and dark energy, he was the leading pioneer in the theory of cosmic structure formation in the 1970s. Long before it was considered a serious, quantitative branch of physics, Peebles was studying physical cosmology and has done much to establish its respectability. Peebles said, \\"It was not a single step, some critical discovery that suddenly made cosmology relevant but the field gradually emerged through a number of experimental observations. Clearly one of the most important during my career was the detection of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation that immediately attracted attention [...] both experimentalists interested in measuring the properties of this radiation and theorists, who joined in analyzing the implications\\". His Shaw Prize citation states \\"He laid the foundations for almost all modern investigations in cosmology, both theoretical and observational, transforming a highly speculative field into a precision science.\\" Peebles has a long record of innovating the basic ideas, which would be extensively studied later by other scientists. For instance, in 1987, he proposed the primordial isocurvature baryon model for the development of the early universe.Hu (June 28, 1994) Similarly, Peebles contributed to establishing the dark matter problem in the early 1970s. Peebles is also known for the Ostriker‚ÄìPeebles criterion, relating to the stability of galactic formation. Peebles' body of work was recognized with him being named a 2019 Nobel Laureate in Physics, \\"for theoretical discoveries in physical cosmology\\"; Peebles shared half the prize with Michel Mayor and Didier Queloz who had been the first to discover an exoplanet around a main sequence star.

Biography Wong was born in Tientsin, Republic of China. He studied Western art at Fu Jen Catholic University, then based in Peking, and finished school by 1944. In 1956, he moved south to British Hong Kong. He was responsible for drawings in Bibles for a French Catholic missionary in the colony and also became the art editor for Hong Kong Catholic magazine, Lok Fung Pao ().Wong, Wendy Siuyi. [2002] (2001) Hong Kong Comics: A History of Manhua. Princeton Architectural Press, New York. Wong became well known in 1961 when he copied the manhua Old Master Q. The comic was one of the most influential pieces of work in Hong Kong under British rule before it was transferred back to China, and was popular across Asia. It voiced the opinions of the citizens in an exaggerated comical sense at a time when comics avoided controversial political issues. From integration with mainlanders to the education gap, there were few limitations being broached by the sensitive subjects which accompanied his stories. The comic became known for maintaining popularity for over 40 years against endless competition with other Hong Kong manhua and Japanese manga. Later adaptations into movies, Chinese animation and other works of fiction continued well after his retirement. He later emigrated to the United States, and had retired by the mid-1990s. In an exhibition showcasing Wong, the Hong Kong Arts Centre called his work, \\"a collective memory of Chinese-speaking communities around the world.\\" Original pieces of Wong's work have been exhibited by both Sotheby's and Christie's auction houses. Personal life Wong was ambidextrous (i.e. capable of drawing with both hands) and particularly enjoyed drawing fish. He used his eldest son's name Wong Chak () as a pen-name and relinquished the comic to him in 1995. Wong died of organ failure on 1 January 2017, at the age of 93. He is also the son of the ethnic- Manchu Chinese warlord Wang Chengbin.

The highest peak is Guru Shikhar at .  Etymology  Aravalli, a composite Sanskrit word from \\"ara\\" and \\"vali\\", literally means the \\"line of peaks\\".  Natural history  = Geology = Map of prominent mountain ranges in India, showing Aravalli in north-west India The Aravalli Range, an eroded stub of ancient mountains, is the oldest range of fold mountains in India.Roy, A. B. (1990). Evolution of the Precambrian crust of the Aravalli Range. Developments in Precambrian Geology, 8, 327‚Äì347. The natural history of the Aravalli Range dates back to times when the Indian Plate was separated from the Eurasian Plate by an ocean. The Proterozoic Aravalli-Delhi orogenic belt in northwest India is similar to the younger Himalayan-type orogenic belts of the Mesozoic-Cenozoic era (of the Phanerozoic) in terms of component parts and appears to have passed through a near-orderly Wilson supercontinental cycle of events. The range rose in a Precambrian event called the Aravalli-Delhi Orogen. The Aravalli Range is a northeast‚Äìsouthwest trending orogenic belt that is located in the northwestern part of Indian Peninsula. It is part of the Indian Shield that was formed from a series of cratonic collisions.Mishra, D.C.; Kumar, M. Ravi. Proterozoic orogenic belts and rifting of Indian cratons: Geophysical constraints. Geoscience Frontiers. 2013 March. 5: 25‚Äì41. In ancient times, Aravalli were extremely high but since have worn down almost completely by millions of years of weathering, whereas the Himalayas being young fold mountains are still continuously rising. Aravalli, being the old fold mountains, have stopped growing higher due to the cessation of upward thrust caused by the stopping of movement of the tectonic plates in the Earth's crust below them. The Aravalli Range joins two of the ancient earth's crust segments that make up the greater Indian craton, the Aravalli Craton which is the Marwar segment of earth's crust to the northwest of the Aravalli Range, and the Bundelkand Craton segment of earth's crust to the southeast of the Aravalli Range. Cratons, generally found in the interiors of tectonic plates, are old and stable parts of the continental lithosphere that has remained relatively undeformed during the cycles of merging and rifting of continents. volcanic arc and geological process of undersea subduction during tactonic collusion global convergent boundary of plate margins It consists of two main sequences formed in Proterozoic eon, metasedimentary rock (sedimentary rocks metamorphised under pressure and heat without melting) and metavolcanic rock (metamorphised volcanic rocks) sequences of the Aravalli Supergroup and Delhi Supergroup. These two supergroups rest over the Archean Bhilwara Gneissic Complex basement, which is a gneissic (high-grade metamorphism of sedimentary or igneous rocks) basement formed during the archean eon 4 Ga ago. It started as an inverted basin, that rifted and pulled apart into granitoid basement, initially during Aravalli passive rifting around 2.5 to 2.0 Ga years ago and then during Delhi active rifting around 1.9 to 1.6 Ga years ago. It started with rifting of a rigid Archaean continent banded gneissic complex around 2.2 Ga with the coexisting formation of the Bhilwara aulacogen in its eastern part and eventual rupturing and separation of the continent along a line parallel to the Rakhabdev (Rishabhdev) lineament to the west, simultaneous development of a passive continental margin with the undersea shelf rise sediments of the Aravalli-Jharol belts depositing on the attenuated crust on the eastern flank of the separated continent, subsequent destruction of the continental margin by accretion of the Delhi island arc (a type of archipelago composed of an arc-shaped chain of volcanoes closely situated parallel to a convergent boundary between two converging tectonic plates) from the west around 1.5 Ga. This tectonic plates collision event involved early thrusting with partial obduction (overthrusting of oceanic lithosphere onto continental lithosphere at a convergent plate boundary) of the oceanic crust along the Rakhabdev lineament, flattening and eventual wrenching (also called strike-slip plate fault, sideways horizontal movement of colliding plates with no vertical motion) parallel to the collision zone. Associated mafic igneous rocks show both continental and oceanic tholeiitic geochemistry (magnesium and iron-rich igneous rocks) from phanerozoic eon (541‚Äì0 million) with rift-related magmatic rock formations. The Aravalli-Delhi Orogen is an orogen event that led to a large structural deformation of the Earth's lithosphere (crust and uppermost mantle, such as Aravalli and Himalayas fold mountains) due to the interaction between tectonic plates when a continental plate is crumpled and is pushed upwards to form mountain ranges, and involve a great range of geological processes collectively called orogenesis. = Minerals = The archean basement had served as a rigid indentor which controlled the overall wedge shaped geometry of the orogen. Lithology of area shows that the base rocks of Aravalli are of Mewar Gneiss formed by high-grade regional metamorphic processes from preexisting formations that were originally sedimentary rock with earliest life form that were formed during the archean eon, these contain fossils of unicellular organism such as green algae and cyanobacteria in stromatolitic carbonate ocean reefs formed during the paleoproterozoic era. Sedimentary exhalative deposits of base metal sulfide ores formed extensively along several, long, linear zones in the Bhilwara aulacogen or produced local concentration in the rifted Aravalli continental margin, where rich stromatolitic phosphorites also formed. Tectonic evolution of the Aravalli Mountains shows Mewar Geniss rocks are overlain by Delhi Supergroup type of rocks that also have post-Aravalli intrusions. Metal sulfide ores were formed in two different epochs, lead and zinc sulfide ores were formed in the sedimentary rocks around 1.8 Ga years ago during Paleoproterozoic phase. The tectonic setting of Zinc-lead-copper sulfides mineralisation in Delhi supergroup rocks in Haryana-Delhi were formed in mantle plume volcanic action around 1 Ga years ago covering Haryana and Rajasthan during mesoproterozoic. In the southern part of Aravalli supergroup arc base metal sulfides were generated near the subduction zone on the western fringe and in zones of back- arc extension to the south-east. Continued subduction produced W-Sn (Tungsten- Tin) mineralisation in S-type (sedimentary unmetamorphosed rock) felsic (volcanic rock) plutons (underground crystallised solidified magma). This includes commercially viable quantities of minerals, such as rock phosphate, lead-zinc-silver mineral deposits at Zawar, Rikahbdev serpentinite, talc and pyrophyllite) and asbestos, apatite, kyanite and beryl.M.

ABC-CLIO, 2008 p77 = Geographical features = The Aravalli Range, seen from the range's highest point at Guru Shikhar, in Rajasthan. The Indian Craton includes five major cratons. Cratons are part of continental crust made up of upper layer called platforms and older bottom layer called basement rocks. shields are part of a craton where basement rock crops out at the surface and it is the relatively oldest and most stable part that are undeformed by the plate tectonics. The Aravalli Craton (Marwar-Mewar Craton or Western Indian Craton) covers Rajasthan as well as western and southern Haryana. It includes the Mewar Craton in the east and Marwar Craton in the west. It is limited by the Great Boundary Fault in the east, the Thar desert in the west, Indo-gangetic alluvium in the north, and the Son River-Narmada River-Tapti River basins in the south. It mainly has quartzite, marble, pelite, greywacke and extinct volcanos exposed in the Aravalli-Delhi Orogen. Malani Igneous Suite is the largest in India and third largest igneous suit in the world.Cratons of India.Cratons of India, lyellcollection.org.

It forms the basement rock for both the Delhi Supergroup and the Aravalli Supergroup. * Aravalli Supergroup: The Aravalli supergroup passes through Rajasthan state, dividing it into two halves, with three-fifths of Rajasthan on the western side towards the Thar Desert and two-thirds on the eastern side consisting of the catchment area of Banas and Chambal rivers bordering the state of Madhya Pradesh. Guru Shikhar, the highest peak in the Aravalli Range at in Mount Abu of Rajasthan, lies near the south-western extremity of the Central Aravalli range, close to the border with Gujarat state. The southern Aravalli Supergroup enters the northeast of Gujarat near Modasa where it lends its name to the Aravalli district, and ends at the centre of the state at Palanpur near Ahmedabad. ** Champaner Group is a rectangular outcrop composed of subgreywacke, siliceous phyllite, pelitic schist, quartzite and pertomict conglomerate. ** Lunavada Group is a polygon area in the south of the Aravali Orogen composed of greywacke-phyllite ** Jharol Group is spread over 200 km2 area with average width of 40 km carbonate-free phyllite and arenite with turbidite facies and argillaceous rocks. ** Udaipur Group is a thick accumulation of greywacke-phyllite basement overlain by dolomite. ** Debari Group consists of carbonates, quartzite, and pelitic rocks which are overlain by the Delwara group. ** Delwara Group is spread over a 500 km2 area with average thickness of 500 m and includes basement orthoquartzite overlain by volcanic congolomerate. ** Unconformities *** Mangalwar/Sandmata Complex and Mewar Gneiss with enclaves of the Jagat group * Delhi Supergroup ** Alwar Group with arenaceous and mafic volcanic rocks *** Delhi Ridge, in the north *** Haryana Aravalli ranges, in the west **** Tosham Hill range basement rocks include quartzite with chiastolite, the upper layers of quartz porphyry ring dyke, felsite, welded tuff and muscovite biotite granite rocks which have commercially nonviable tin, tungsten and copper.

Ravindra Nath Singh and his team of Banaras Hindu University carried out ASI-financed excavations of Indus Valley Civilization site on the grounds of the Government School in Khanak, during 2014 and 2016. They found early to mature Harappan phase IVC materials, pottery, semiprecious beads of lapis lazuli, carnelian and others. They also found evidence of matallurgical activities, such as crucibles (used for pouring molten metal), furnace lining, burnt floor, ash and ore slugs. Ceramic petrography, metallography, scanning electron microscope (SEM, non-destructive, surface images of nanoscale resolution), energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDXA and EDXMA non-destructive, qualitative and quantitative elemental composition) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM, destructive method) scientific studies of the material found prove that the Khanak site was inhabited by the IVC metal-workers who used the locally mined polymetalic tin, and they were also familiar with metallurgical work with copper and bronze. The lowest level of site dates back as far the pre-Harappan era to Sothi-Siswal culture (4600 BCE or 6600 BP) tentatively. = Ganeshwar sunari Cultural Complex = The Ganeshwar sunari Cultural Complex (GSCC) is a collection of third millennium BC settlements in the area of the Aravalli Hill Range.

This corridor is an important habitat for the Indian leopards and jackals of Aravalli. In January 2019, the Wildlife Institute of India announced that they will undertake the survey of leopard and wildlife, using pugmarks and trap cameras, subsequently, leopards and jackals will be tracked via the radio collars. Urban development, especially the highways and railways bisecting the Aravalli range and wildlife corridor in several places pose a great risk. Large parts of Aravalli are legally and physically unprotected, with no wildlife passages and little or no wildlife conservation work resulting in deaths of over 10 leopards in 4 years between January 2015 to January 2019.Death, proof of leopard life in Asola sanctuary, Hindustan Times, 31 January 2019.10-month-old leopard found dead on Gurugram-Faridabad Expressway, India Today, 31 January 2019.Leopard killed in accident on Gurugram-Faridabad road, Times of India, 30 January 2019. The Haryana side of the Gurugram- Faridabad Aravalli hill forests lack availability of water due to which wild animals are seldom seen there. The Government of Haryana used drones for aerial surveys and dug 22 ephemeral pits in 2018 to store the rainwater which became dry during the summer months. In January 2019, the government announced the plan to make the pit perennial by connecting those with pipelines from the nearby villages.Leopards keep away from Haryana side of Asola due to scarcity, Times of India, 1 February 2019. Human activity, such as unplanned urbanisation and polluting industrial plants, also pose a great threat.

The first-ever 2017 wildlife survey of a 200 square kilometre area crossing five districts (Gurgaon, Faridabad, Mewat, Rewari and Mahendergarh) of Haryana by the Wildlife Institute of India (WII) found 14 species, including leopards, striped hyena (7 sightings), golden jackal (9 sightings, with 92% occupancy across the survey area), nilgai (55 sightings), palm civet (7 sightings), wild pig (14 sightings), rhesus macaque (55 sightings), peafowl (57 sightings) and Indian crested porcupine (12 sightings). Encouraged by the first survey, the wildlife department has prepared a plan for a comprehensive study and census of wildlife across the whole Aravalli Range, including radio collar tracking of the wild animals. Well known leopard and hyena habitat is along the Ferozpure Jhirka-Nuh Aravali range as well as Delhi South Ridge (Faridabad-Gurugram) to Farrukhnagar area on the Delhi-Haryana border, with reports of sightings in Saidpur, Lokri and Jhund Sarai Viran villages near the KMP expressway; Bhukarka 7 km from Pataudi; Pathkori, Bhond, Mandawar in Ferozepur Jirka region.Traps set up in four villages of Farrukhnagar after leopard's presence confirmed by pug marks, Hindustan Times, 18 January 2019. =Concerns= In May 1992, some parts of the Aravalli hills in Rajasthan and Haryana were protected from mining through the Ecologically Sensitive Areas clauses of Indian laws. In 2003, the central government of India prohibited mining operations in these areas. In 2004, India's Supreme Court banned mining in the notified areas of Aravalli Range. In May 2009, the Supreme Court extended the ban on mining in an area of 448 km2 across the Faridabad, Gurgaon and Mewat districts in Haryana, covering the Aravalli Range.SC bans all mining activity in Aravali hills area of Haryana, 9 May 2009.Mission Green: SC bans mining in Aravali hills Hindustan Times, 9 May 2009. A 2013 report used high-resolution Cartosat-1 & LISS-IV satellite imaging to determine the existence and condition of mines in the Aravalli Range. In the Guru Gram district, the Aravalli hills occupy an area of 11,256 hectares, of which 491 (4.36%) hectares had mines, of which 16 hectares (0.14%) were abandoned flooded mines. In the Faridabad and Mewat districts, about 3610 hectares were part of mining industry, out of a total of 49,300 hectares. These mines were primarily granite and marble quarries for India's residential and real estate construction applications.Rai and Kumar, Mapping of Mining Areas in Aravalli Hills in Gurgaon, Faridabad & Mewat Districts of Haryana Using Geo-Informatics Technology, International Journal of Remote Sensing & Geoscience, Volume 2, Issue 1, Jan. 2013 In the Central Rajasthan region, Sharma states that the presence of some mining has had both positive and negative effects on neighbouring agriculture and the ecosystem. The rain- induced erosion brings nutrients as well as potential contaminants.Sharma, K. C. (2003). Perplexities and Ecoremediation of Central Aravallis of Rajasthan. Environmental Scenario for 21st Century, , Chapter 20  Economy  The Aravali Range is the source area of many rivers, resulting in development of human settlements with sustainable economy since pre-historic times. The Delhi Mumbai Industrial Corridor Project, Western Dedicated Freight Corridor, Mumbai‚ÄìAhmedabad high-speed rail corridor, North Western Railway network, Jaipur-Kishangarh Expressway and Delhi-Jaipur Expressway, all run parallel to the length of the Aravalli Range providing an economic boost.Jha, Bagis, TNN. 195-km super expressway to link Delhi, Jaipur, The Economic Times, 21 March 2017, Accessed on 20 June 2017.  Tourism  Aravali range is the home of several forests, wildlife, and protected areas, UNESCO heritage listed forts, hundreds of rivers and ancient history to sustain a large tourism industry.  Concerns  Damage to the environment and ecology from the unorganised urbanisation, overexploitation of the natural resources including water and minerals, mining, untreated human waste and disposal, pollution, loss of forest cover and wildlife habitat, unprotected status of most of the Aravalli and the lack of an integrated Aravalli management agency are the major causes of concern.

He was the first African American in the U.S. Navy to serve aboard a fighting ship as an officer, the first to command a Navy ship, the first fleet commander, and the first to become a flag officer, retiring as a vice admiral.  Early life and training  Gravely was born on June 4, 1922 in Richmond, Virginia, the oldest of five children of Mary George Gravely and postal worker Samuel L. Gravely Sr. He attended Virginia Union University but left before graduating to join the Naval Reserve in 1942. He had attempted to enlist in the U.S. Army in 1940 but was turned away due to a supposed heart murmur. After receiving basic training at Naval Station Great Lakes, Illinois, Gravely entered the V-12 Navy College Training Program at the University of California, Los Angeles. Upon graduating from UCLA, he completed Midshipmen's School at Columbia University and was commissioned an ensign on November 14, 1944. His commission came only eight months after the \\"Golden Thirteen\\" became the first African-American officers in the U.S. Navy.  World War II and Korean War  Gravely began his seagoing career as the only black officer aboard the submarine chaser , which was one of two U.S. Navy ships (the other being ) with a predominantly black enlisted crew. Before June 1, 1942, African Americans could only enlist in the Navy as messmen; PC-1264 and Mason were intended to test the ability of African Americans to perform general Navy service. For the remainder of World War II, PC-1264 conducted patrols and escort missions along the east coast of the U.S. and south to the Caribbean. In 1946, Gravely was released from active duty, remaining in the Naval Reserve. He married schoolteacher Alma Bernice Clark later that year; the couple went on to raise three children, Robert, David, and Tracey. He returned to his hometown of Richmond and re-enrolled at Virginia Union University, graduating in 1948 with a degree in history and then working as a railway postal clerk. Gravely was recalled to active duty in 1949 and worked as a recruiter in Washington, D.C. before holding both shore and sea assignments during the Korean War. During that time he served on the USS Iowa as a communications officer. He transferred from the Reserve to the regular Navy in 1955 and began to specialize in naval communications.  Vietnam War and later career  Many of Gravely's later career achievements represented \\"firsts\\" for African Americans. In 1961, he became the first African-American officer to command a U.S. Navy ship, the (Robert Smalls had briefly commanded a Navy ship in the American Civil War, although he was a civilian, not a Navy officer). When he took command of the destroyer escort in January 1962, he was the first African-American officer to command a combat ship. During the Vietnam War he commanded the destroyer as it performed plane guard duty and gunfire support off the coast of Vietnam in 1966, making him the first African American to lead a ship into combat. In 1967 he became the first African American to reach the rank of captain, and in 1971 the first to reach rear admiral. Capt. Samuel Gravely, U.S. Navy photograph circa 1970. At the time of his promotion to rear admiral, he was in command of the guided missile frigate . Gravely commanded Cruiser-Destroyer Group 2. He was later named the Director of Naval Communications. From 1976 to 1978, he commanded the Third Fleet based in Hawaii, then transferred to Virginia to direct the Defense Communications Agency until his retirement in 1980. Gravely's military decorations include the World War II Victory Medal, the Korean Service Medal with two service stars, the United Nations Korea Medal, and the Republic of Korea Presidential Unit Citation.  Later years and legacy  Following his military retirement, Gravely settled in rural Haymarket, Virginia, and worked as a consultant. After suffering a stroke, Gravely died at the National Naval Medical Center in Bethesda, Maryland, on October 22, 2004. He was buried in Arlington National Cemetery. In Richmond, the street on which Gravely grew up was renamed \\"Admiral Gravely Boulevard\\" in 1977. The destroyer , commissioned in 2010, was named in his honor. Vice Admiral Gravely is honored annually in San Pedro, California, aboard Battleship Iowa, at the Gravely Celebration Experience. Each year the organization honors trailblazers exemplifying VADM Gravely's leadership and service with the Leadership & Service Award. An essay competition for U.S. History high school students that explores VADM Gravely's motto: Education, Motivation, Perseverance is affiliated with the annual event.

In the case of the United States military, service stripes are authorized for wear by enlisted members on the lower part of the sleeve of a uniform to denote length of service. Service stripes vary in size and in color. Criteria Army National Guard sergeant Monica Beltran in 2012 with three service stripes, indicating at least 9 years of service. The United States Army authorizes one stripe for each three-year period of service, while the United States Marine Corps, United States Navy, and United States Coast Guard authorize one stripe for each four-year period of duty. In contrast to the Army, the Navy and Marine Corps Good Conduct Medals, a service stripe is authorized for wear by enlisted personnel upon completion of the specified term of service, regardless of the service member's disciplinary history. For example, a soldier with several non-judicial punishments and courts-martial would still be authorized a service stripe for three years' service, although the Good Conduct Medal would be denied. History In 1777, the French ancien r√©gime-era army had used Galons d'anciennet√©, or \\"Seniority Braid\\" (cloth braid chevrons nicknamed brisures > \\"breaks\\") worn on the upper sleeves awarded for each seven years of enlistment. Soldiers who wore such emblems were called briscards (\\"breakers\\"). The practice was continued in Napoleon Bonaparte's army in which they were awarded for 10, 15, and 20 years of service. The French Army later moved them to the lower sleeves and the rank stripes to the upper sleeves. Service chevrons were worn on the lower left sleeve and Wound Stripes were worn on the lower right sleeve (influencing the U.S. Wound Chevron device). In the United States, the concept of a service stripe dates back to 1782 when, during the American Revolution, George Washington ordered that enlisted men who had served for three years \\"with bravery, fidelity and good conduct\\" should wear \\"a narrow piece of white cloth, of angular form\\" on the left sleeve of the uniform coat. In the U.S. Army, sleeve stripes denoted a successful completion of a standard enlistment. They were the same color as the enlisted rank stripes and were \\"half-chevrons\\" (angled strips of cloth). Service during the American Civil War was denoted by a red stripe bordered by the rank stripe color (called a \\"Blood Stripe\\"). The artillery corps, who wore red stripes on their uniforms, wore a white stripe bordered red instead. Wear and use =United States= Sleeve stripes are worn only by enlisted personnel. U.S. Army soldiers, U.S. Navy sailors and U.S. Coast Guardsmen wear their stripes on the bottom cuff of the left sleeve, where U.S. Marines wear them at the bottom cuff of both sleeves. Since 1953 U.S. soldiers wear them on the left sleeve and Overseas Service Bars on the right one. Prior to 1953, Overseas Service Bars were worn on the left sleeve. Service stripes are only worn on formal uniforms, and are not seen on work uniforms. Navy service stripes come in three colors and they are red, gold, and black. They are 7 inches long and three eighths of an inch wide for male chief petty officers; male sailors from rates seaman recruit to petty officer first class wear service stripes 5¬º inches long and three eighths of an inch wide. Female navy sailors wear service stripes 5¬º inches long and a quarter- inch wide. They are worn two inches above the left sleeve cuff on jackets, and 1¬Ω inches above the cuff on service dress blue jumpers and the new summer white jumpers. On the old-style summer white jumpers they are worn two inches above the cuff. Multiple navy service stripes are worn quarter-inch apart from each other. United States Navy, U.S. Marine Corps, and U.S. Coast Guard 1 red U.S. Navy service stripe, denoting 4 years of service. For the U.S. Navy, Marine Corps, and Coast Guard, service stripes are given to those service members for every four years of service. =Color= The U.S. Navy authorizes gold service stripes for those sailors with over twelve cumulative years' of service. Until June 2019, the service had to have been free of disciplinary action in the U.S. Navy and U.S. Navy Reserve. During the period when that rule was in effect, in cases where a disciplinary infraction had occurred, the sailor was not denied a service stripe but simply was authorized the standard red stripe design only. Like the U.S. Navy, the U.S. Coast Guard authorizes gold and red service stripes as well, however the color in the case of the latter does not depend on time in service, but on rank instead: Junior enlisted personnel (i.e. those in paygrades E-1 to E-6) wear red service stripes, whereas chief petty officers (i.e. those in paygrades E-7 to E-9) wear gold service stripes. United States Military Academy These stripes are also used on the sleeves of the full dress uniform worn by cadets of the United States Military Academy at West Point, which denote the number of years a cadet has been at the academy. This is also done by cadets of other military colleges and prep schools. United States Air Force The United States Air Force is the only branch of service that does not authorize service stripes. The Air Force Longevity Service Ribbon is awarded instead. Historically, persons who were in the Army Air Forces and then became part of the Air Force when it was separated from the Army in 1947 could continue to wear their service stripes. U.S. law enforcement use In many civilian law enforcement agencies in the United States, policemen, troopers, constables, and sheriff's deputies will often be awarded service stripes for wear on their long sleeved uniforms, usually on the lower left sleeve. One stripe may be worn for varying lengths of time and differs by agency; for instance the Los Angeles Police Department issues one service stripe for every five years served.

VTAM provides an application programming interface (API) for communication applications, and controls communication equipment such as adapters and controllers. In modern terminology, VTAM provides a communication stack and device drivers. History VTAM was introduced in 1974 after a series of delays as a major component of SNA along with the 370x Network Control Program (NCP) and Synchronous Data Link Control (SDLC). In IBM terminology, VTAM is an access method software allowing application programs to read and write data to and from external devices. It is called 'virtual' because it was introduced at the time when IBM was introducing virtual memory by upgrading the operating systems of the System/360 series to virtual storage versions. VTAM was supposed to be the successor to the older telecommunications access methods, such as Basic telecommunications access method (BTAM) and Telecommunications Access Method (TCAM), which were maintained for compatibility reasons. As such, VTAM is comparable with the Virtual Storage Access Method (VSAM), which was at that time a new and supposedly converged access method for disk storage. =ACF/VTAM= Originally, VTAM was provided free of charge like most systems software of that time. However, VTAM 2 was the last version to be freely available. ACF/VTAM (Advanced Communication Function/Virtual Telecommunications Access Method) was introduced in 1976 and was provided for a licence fee. The major new feature of ACF/VTAM was the Multisystem Networking Facility, which introduced \\"implementation of intersystem communication among multiple S/370s.\\". A limited version of ACF/VTAM known as ACF/VTAME (Advanced Communications Function for the Virtual Telecommunications Access Method Entry) was made available for DOS/VSE systems running on the IBM 4300. =SNA Services= VTAM has been renamed to be the SNA Services feature of Communications Server for OS/390. This software package also provides TCP/IP functions. VTAM is used in multiple enterprises as of September 2019. Features VTAM supports several network protocols, including SDLC, Token Ring, start-stop, Bisync, local (channel attached) 3270 devices, and later TCP/IP. In a VTAM network, communication took place through an integrated communication adapter in the mainframe itself, or by a separate programmable front-end processor, the IBM 3745/3746 Communications Processor, with its own operating system, the Network Control Program NCP. These machines are no longer actively marketed by IBM, but are still supported. IBM provides hardware maintenance and microcode updates for the estimated 20,000 installed 3745/3746 controllers. A robust third party industry of smaller 3745/3746 specialty companies provide such controllers, upgrades, features, and related support services. VTAM and SNA are still in use by many enterprises. Initially, VTAM only allowed communication between mainframes and peripheral equipment such as terminals, distributed processors and minicomputers. Later, 'cross-domain' services were introduced (not to be confused with TCP/IP domains) allowing SNA networks with more than one mainframe. A subsequent development was SNA Network Interconnect (SNI), allowing networks of different organizational entities (firms) to be interconnected with a high degree of independence. Finally, Advanced Peer to Peer Networking functions (APPN) were added to VTAM. In APPN the mainframe is no longer the heart of the network, but all nodes in the network are considered as peers. One of the reasons why APPN was introduced was to act as a DECnet-killer, but by the time APPN was actually shipped the popularity of DECnet had already declined. APPN was considered overly complex and as of 2012 has been largely superseded by TCP/IP.

Engraved by Blake and Linnell.Garnett, R. William Blake, painter and poet 1895 London: Seeley p.61 Wilson Lowry FRS (24 January 1762 ‚Äì 23 June 1824) was an English engraver. Life He was born at Whitehaven, Cumberland, the son of Strickland Lowry, a portrait painter. The family settled in Worcester, and Wilson Lowry, as a boy, left home to work as a house painter in London and Arundel, Sussex. On returning home is received some instruction in engraving from a local craftsman. He went to London at the age of 18 with an introduction to the print seller John Boydell, who gave him work and introduced him to William Blizard, the surgeon. Blizard encouraged Lowry to become a surgeon and for four years he undertook training, but abandoned it. Lowry studied under John Browne, the landscape engraver and also received training at the Royal Academy. Lowry developed a number of special instruments to assist his work: about 1790 he devised a ruling machine; in 1801 a device for generating elliptical curves; in 1806 another for making perspective drawings. Lowry was the first engraver to use diamond points and to discover the composition of a corrosive fluid for biting the lines into steel plates. Lowry specialised in making engraving of architectural and mechanical topics, and excelled in perspective views of machinery. His work appears in Tilloch's Philosophical Magazine, and the Journal of the Society of Arts, Wilkins's Magna Graecia (1807), and Vitruvius (1812), Peter Nicholson's Principles of Architecture (1795-98), and Architectural Dictionary (1819), George Crabb's Technological Dictionary (1823), and the Encyclop√¶dia Metropolitana. Lowry's most famous work in this field was undoubtedly the work he did for Rees's Cyclop√¶dia between 1802 and 1819, including contributing articles, but did work for other encyclopaedias including Pantologia and the British Encyclopedia, or Dictionary of Arts and Sciences. Lowry was a founder member of the Geological Society and was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1812. He died at his residence, Great Titchfield Street, London. Family He married firstly a Miss Porter: they had two daughters, one of whom, Matilda, (who became Mrs Hemming) was a portrait painter. He married secondly Rebecca Delvalle (1761‚Äì1848) a mineralogist: they had a son Joseph Wilson Lowry and a daughter Delvalle Lowry, who married John Varley the landscape painter.

Babywearing has been practiced for centuries around the world. In the industrialized world, babywearing has gained popularity in recent decades. Part of the reason for this shift is due to the influence of advocates of attachment parenting. Babywearing is a form of baby transport which can be enjoyed for as long as mutually desired, often until toddlerhood and beyond.Blois, M, MD. (2005). Babywearing: The Benefits and Beauty of This Ancient Tradition. Pharmasoft Publishing. Woman demonstrates how to use a stretch wrap style sling. Benefits Dr. William Sears, a pediatrician, coined the phrase attachment parenting. One of Sears' principles of attachment parenting is babywearing and he attributes many benefits to babywearing and the in-arms style of parenting. The benefits of babywearing include: * In the wearing of newborns in particular, the mothers' oxytocin levels are increased through the physical contact with the infant, leading to a more intimate maternal bond, easier breastfeeding and better care, thus lowering the incidence of postpartum depression and psychosomatic illness in the mother;\\"\\"Regulation of anxiety during the postpartum period\\"\\", Lonstein, Joseph S., Frontiers in Neuroendocrinology, Volume 28, Issues 2-3, August‚ÄìSeptember 2007, Accessed 2009-05-09 similarly, the father carrying the baby has benefits for the paternal bond. * Infants who are carried are generally calmer, as more of their primal/survival needs are met. The caregiver can be seen, heard, smelled, touched, tasted, provide feeding and the motion necessary for continuing neural development, gastrointestinal and respiratory health and to establish balance (inner ear development) and muscle tone is constant.Morris, D. (1992). What Comforts a Baby? In Babywatching (pp 80-82). New York: Crown Publishers Inc. * Parental rhythms (walking, heartbeat, etc.) can have balancing and soothing effects on infants. * Infants are \\"humanized\\" earlier by developing socially. Babies are closer to people and can study facial expressions, learn languages faster and be familiar with body language.Kitzinger, Sheila. (1989). The Crying Baby. Penguin Books. * Independence is established earlier. * Attachment between child and caregiver is more secure.Anisfeld, E., Casper, V., Nozyce, M., & Cunningham, N. (Oct., 1990). Does Infant Carrying Promote Attachment? An Experimental Study of the Effects of Increased Physical Contact on the Development of Attachment. Child Development, Vol. 61, No. 5, 1617-1627. * Decreases risk of positional plagiocephaly (\\"flat head syndrome\\") caused by extended time spent in a car seat and by sleeping on the back. * Appropriate babywearing, particularly inward-facing babywearing can be beneficial to neck muscle development, and contribute positively to healthy hip development. Kangaroo care, in which the baby's bare body rests against the parent's bare chest, with or without a baby sling, has shown clear benefits to premature and ill infants. Studies of parent-child attachment, parental satisfaction and infant crying point to babywearing as a satisfactory arrangement for both parents and baby. Baby carriers and slings help increase the number of hours a day an infant is held, and proponents believe that the more a baby is held, the less the baby cries.Klaus, M., Kennell, J., Klause, P: Bonding, pp 126,204-5. Addison Wesley Publishing Company, 1995. However, this experience is not universal; for example, the indigenous Munduruku people of Brazil use baby slings to carry their babies all day. The babies are allowed to nurse freely, and are passed from one woman or girl to another to be carried throughout the day. Yet, the Munduruku babies cry very frequently despite being carried all day.  Practicality  Nez Perce cradleboard (1911). Babywearing allows the wearer to have two free hands to accomplish tasks such as laundry while caring for the baby's need to be held or be breastfed. Babywearing offers a safer alternative to placing a car seat on top of a shopping cart. It also allows children to be involved in social interactions and to see their surroundings as an adult would. It follows that many sling and soft carrier users have found that carrying their infant is much easier on the back and shoulders than lugging them in a car seat. The weight of the child is spread more evenly across the upper body and they don't have to struggle with a bulky, hard and awkward car seat. There are many different types of carriers available to purchase or swap, and they can also easily and cheaply be made by the parent or caregiver, also laws in the United States have now limited the legality of manufacturing carriers and slings. Wraps, slings, mei tais, and soft structured carriers with buckles (also referred to as SSCs)make up the vast majority of carriers. In the western world, carriers can also be seen as a fashion statement and be worn as part of an outfit. They come in many different designs and colors and are available in many different types of fabrics from specialist manufacturers, including bamboo, silk, hemp, cotton, wool, fleece, flax/linen and more recently some synthetic blends such as Repreve and Tencel.  Infant feeding and babywearing  Breastfeeding and babywearing often go hand in hand. Many baby slings and other carriers offer mothers privacy and for many mothers, the option of nursing hands-free while tending to other activities or household chores. Not all mothers can nurse hands-free in a baby carrier. Large-breasted mothers and mothers of small or hypotonic infants may need to support the breast or help maintain proper positioning of the baby's head or body. Even so, a properly adjusted baby carrier can help reduce arm strain and allow a mother more freedom of movement while nursing, even if it does not allow her to be completely hands-free. Mother breastfeeding infant in a ring sling baby carrier. Babywearing can help premature babies and babies who are slow weight gainers to gain weight at a faster rate.Hasselmeyer, E. G. (1964). The premature neonate's response to handling. Journal of the American Nursing Association, I. 15-24.Solkoff, N, et al. (1969). Effects of handling on the subsequent development of premature infants. Developmental Psychology, 1(6). 765-768. Since the baby is held up close to the mother, the baby will be able to be nursed more often and often for longer intervals. Not all parents find breastfeeding in a sling or carrier easy. It is important, before attempting to breastfeed in a carrier, to first master the art of breastfeeding without a carrier. Latch and position are vital, and it is important to establish these first before adding a carrier to the mix. Where breastfeeding difficulties exist, babywearing can simplify the other tasks of parenting by allowing a parent free hands to deal with breastpumps, bottles and other supplementation devices.\\"Breastfeeding in a Carrier\\" , TheBabywearer.com Wiki. Some parents prefer, even with the best carriers, to take time out and sit down to nurse a baby. Some babies may reflexively clamp down when nursing while a parent moves around, so nursing while babywearing is not always entirely comfortable. Individual experience will vary radically not only from parent to parent, but also from baby to baby, even within the same family. Some babies nurse very well in slings and carriers, others do not. Where breastfeeding is not possible, babywearing can aid attachment by encouraging closeness during bottle feeding. Daycare providers and foster parents often find that babywearing allows them to better meet the needs of multiple children by freeing hands during times when babies need to be held. It is possible to wear two children at once; this is known as tandem babywearing. This can be done with twins or with two children of different ages, for all the reasons of practicality and enjoyment stated above.  Celebrations Babywearing is celebrated around the world each year during the annual International Babywearing Week. Many countries have formed their own celebrations that run alongside this event such as Australian Babywearing Week. and New Zealand Babywearing Week There are also several babywearing conferences such as WEAR and IBC.  Safety As with any physical activity, there are certain safety precautions which must be considered in babywearing. Most are common sense, but the guidelines are particularly important to remember when carrying a newborn baby that has limited head control. The acronym TICKS http://www.schoolofbabywearing.com/Images/TICKS.pdf was created to assist with remembering the safety basics of babywearing: * Tight * In view * Close enough to kiss * Keep chin off the chest * Supported back The question has been raised as to whether or not babywearing is safe with respect to falls. In the case of a caregiver accidentally tripping or falling while wearing a baby, the wearer's arms would likely be free to break the fall, while the child remained relatively safe close to the carer's center of gravity. If the child was being carried 'in arms' without a carrier, the likelihood of injury would be much higher due to the impossibility of the carer being able to both hold the child safely and protect themselves from injury. Exercise with babies in slings and carriers is now a growing way of mothers being able to undertake exercise and movement-based classes with their babies. It has been reported to increase mother-child bonding through physiological and neurological pathways. It is important to find a safe and qualified provider who can ensure the safety of the mother and the baby in the particular exercise class. Babywearing yoga is particularly popular as it does not involve bouncing and moving fast whilst carrying baby in slings. Further reading on the subject of babywearing safety can be widely found. a father also can do babywearing to make him close with his children. Popular Carrier Types The popularity of baby wearing has brought with it an explosion of types and brands of baby carriers, such as the woven wrap, stretchy wrap, ring sling, mei tai, pouch carrier, soft structured carrier, and backpack baby carrier. and in the past years also breezy carriers made of dri fit fabrics to be used in hot weathers and in water activities Woman talks on phone while infant sleeps in pouch carrier.

The battle ended in a victory for the English and their Burgundian allies. Background After the Treaty of Troyes in 1420, the English king was permitted to occupy all the country north of the Loire. In 1422, with Henry V suddenly dead and an infant King Henry VI of England assuming the throne, hostilities resumed.Burne (1991), p.184 In the early summer of 1423, the French Dauphin Charles assembled an army at Bourges intending to invade Burgundian territory. This French army contained a large number of Scots under Sir John Stewart of Darnley, who was commanding the entire mixed force, as well as Spanish and Lombard mercenaries. This army besieged the town of Cravant. The garrison of Cravant requested help from the Dowager Duchess of Burgundy, who raised troops and in turn sought support from Burgundy's English allies, which was forthcoming. The two allied armies, one English, one Burgundian, rendezvoused at Auxerre on 29 July.Burne (1991), pp.184‚Äì6 Allied preparations The allied commanders held a council of war in Auxerre Cathedral on the evening of 29 July. This led to the drafting of an order of battle, covering a mixture of tactical and disciplinary matters. The army was clearly intending to fight a dismounted action, with horses taken to the rear, and archers were to prepare anti-cavalry stakes. That night the army was ordered to pray for victory. The march was to begin at 10 o'clock the following morning.Smith and DeVries (2005), pp. 91‚Äì2 Armies =Allies= The combined English and Burgundian forces were led by Thomas Montacute, 4th Earl of Salisbury, with Lord Willoughby as second in command. The Anglo- Burgundian army mustered about 4,000 men, including 1500 men-at-arms (500 English and 1000 Burgundian), 2000 English archers, some Burgundian crossbowmen and pioneers and 40 veuglaires (light artillery), manned by the citizens of Auxerre.Smith and DeVries (2005), p. 92 =French= The French army was commanded by Sir John Stewart of Darnley with Louis, Count of Vend√¥me, as second in command. There were about 4,000 Scots. A sizeable French force was present with smaller forces of Aragonese and Lombard mercenaries.Burne (1991), p.184 The Dauphinist army was larger than the Anglo- Burgundian force perhaps by two to three times.Burne (1991), p.185 Battle The allied army marched throughout 30 July and that evening, short of Cravant, sighted the enemy. The following day, having assessed the enemy position as too strong, they crossed the river Yonne and attempted to reach Cravant by another route. Approaching the town from across the river, the allies saw that the French army had changed position and was now waiting for them on the other bank.Burne (1991), p188 For three hours the forces watched each other, neither willing to attempt an opposed river crossing. Eventually, the Scots archers began shooting into the allied ranks. The allied artillery replied, supported by their own archers and crossbowmen. Seeing the Dauphinists were suffering casualties and becoming disordered, Salisbury took the initiative and his army began to cross the waist-high river, some 50 metres wide, under a covering barrage of arrows from the English archers. Meanwhile, another force under Willoughby attacked the Scots across the narrow bridge and divided the Dauphin's army. The French began to withdraw, but the Scots refused to flee and fought on, to be cut down by the hundreds. Perhaps 1,200‚Äì3,000 of them fell at the bridgehead or along the riverbanks, and over 2,000 prisoners were taken, including Darnley (who also lost an eye) and the Comte de Vend√¥me. The Dauphin's forces retreated to the Loire. On 2 August, the English and Burgundian armies withdrew separately from Cravant, the Burgundians marching to Dijon, the English to Montaiguillon.Smith & DeVries (2005), p.92Burne (1991) pp.189‚Äì192 Aftermath The success at Cravant was the first for a joint English and Burgundian army. Despite this success, the allies would rarely fight together again, usually operating separately from one another.Smith & DeVries (2005), p.93 The Dauphinists would suffer an even greater defeat the following year at the Battle of Verneuil.

His recordings include many sets later regarded as classics and reissued by EMI as \\"Great Recordings of the Century\\". He worked in the recording industry from 1927, combining this with the post of junior music critic of The Manchester Guardian. He was assistant to Sir Thomas Beecham at the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden, and in World War II played a role in bringing music to the armed forces and civilians. After the war, Legge founded the Philharmonia Orchestra and worked for EMI as a recording producer. In the 1960s, he quarrelled with EMI and resigned. He attempted to disband the Philharmonia in 1964, but it continued as an independent body without him. After this he had no permanent job, and confined himself to giving masterclasses with, and supervising the recordings of, his second wife, Elisabeth Schwarzkopf. Life =Early years= Legge was born in Shepherds Bush, London, where his father was a tailor.Martland, Peter, \\"Legge, (Harry) Walter (1906‚Äì1979)\\", Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004; online edition, January 2010. Retrieved 7 October 2010 He was educated at the Latymer Upper School in Hammersmith.A music scholarship honouring Legge was established by anonymous donors at Latymer Upper School in January 2006. He excelled in Latin and French, but received no musical training. He left school at 16 and had no further formal education. Encouraged by his father he developed a taste for music, and Richard Wagner in particular, in pursuit of which he taught himself to read music and to speak German.Schwarzkopf, pp. 15‚Äì16 Legge first joined HMV in 1927, writing album and analytical notes and copy for the company's monthly retailing magazine, The Voice, but he caught the eye of the leading record producer, Fred Gaisberg, and was soon taking an active role in HMV recording procedures. Between 1933 and 1938, Legge also worked as a music critic for The Manchester Guardian.Mann, William \\"Legge, Walter\\", Grove Music Online, Oxford Music Online. Retrieved 7 October 2010 In the pre-war years, Legge pioneered \\"subscription\\" recordings, by which the public were invited to pay in advance for their copies of future recordings, thus making it economically possible for EMI to make such \\"niche\\" but classic recordings as the songs of Hugo Wolf and the complete piano works of Beethoven (played by Artur Schnabel).Schwarzkopf pp. 57‚Äì58 Another pre-war recording supervised by Legge, which has been reissued on LP and CD, was Sir Thomas Beecham's set of The Magic Flute, made in Berlin in 1937.Schwarzkopf, p. 59 Beecham invited Legge to join him at the Opera as assistant artistic director. Given a free hand by Beecham he engaged Richard Tauber, Jussi Bj√∂rling, Maria Reining, Hilde Konetzni, Julius Patzak and Helge Rosw√§nge in their Covent Garden debuts.Schwarzkopf, p. 60 During World War II, Legge's poor eyesight prevented him from serving in the armed forces. At Beecham's instigation he took on the musical side of ENSA, arranging concerts for British troops all over the world, and securing the services of musicians such as Solomon, Sir Adrian Boult and John Barbirolli.The Times, 20 September 1943, p. 8; Schwarzkopf, pp. 59, 61 In 1941 Legge married the singer Nancy Evans; they divorced in 1948. =EMI and the Philharmonia= After the war Legge set to work to refresh EMI's catalogue and its roster of star performers. He set up his base in Vienna, then still occupied by the Allies, and contracted German and Austrian artists who were then seriously short of work. These performers included Josef Krips, Irmgard Seefried, Ljuba Welitsch, Hans Hotter, Ludwig Weber, Herbert von Karajan and Elisabeth Schwarzkopf (whom Legge married in 1953).Schwarzkopf, p. 64 Later he was among the first to spot the potential of Maria Callas, whose studio recordings he produced for EMI.Schwarzkopf, p. 67 The repertoire he chose to record was broad, though not extending much earlier than Handel and among modern composers concentrating on the approachable and diatonic.Mann, William \\"Walter Legge\\", Gramophone, May 1979, p. 57. Retrieved 7 October 2010 From the 1940s to the 1960s he supervised a long series of recordings of the works of William Walton. Legge had promoted some Lieder recitals before the war, but in 1945, finding his influence at Covent Garden much diminished under the management of David Webster he again ventured into promoting concerts. For these, and for recordings, he founded a new orchestra, the Philharmonia. Beecham conducted its first concert (for the fee of one cigar) but was unwilling to be the employee of his former assistant and soon founded the Royal Philharmonic in competition with the Philharmonia.Legge, Walter, \\"The Birth of the Philharmonia\\", The Times, 27 December 1975, p. 4 In its early years the Philharmonia became closely identified with Karajan, but when he turned his attentions to the Berlin Philharmonic, Legge worked more and more with Otto Klemperer, a prominent conductor in the 1920s and '30s whose career Legge revitalised. Other eminent musicians of the time whom Legge persuaded to conduct the Philharmonia were Wilhelm Furtw√§ngler, Arturo Toscanini and Richard Strauss. At its peak in the 1950s the Philharmonia was widely rated as the finest British orchestra and one of the finest orchestras in the World. In 1964, concerned at what he saw as falling standards, Legge disbanded the orchestra, which at once re-formed as the New Philharmonia, without him but with Klemperer as chief conductor. =Last years= Legge's employer, EMI, tolerated his independent ways for many years, but in the 1960s attempts were made to curtail his freedom of choice of repertoire, and finally in 1964 he resigned. His memoirs, edited by Elisabeth Schwarzkopf and published in 1982, set out his disenchantment with EMI and its increasingly powerful internal committees: :I am convinced that in the arts, committees are useless. What is necessary are people like Karajan, Culshaw and me; we know not only how to achieve the best artistic results but how to attract the public and carry out the whole operation with carefully chosen collaborators. Democracy is fatal for the arts; it leads only to chaos or the achievement of new and lower common denominators of quality.Schwarzkopf, p. 83 Grave in Zumikon In retirement Legge, together with Schwarzkopf, gave many joint masterclasses for young singers but he failed to find a permanent job. He was offered, and accepted, the directorship of the Wexford Festival, but he suffered a disabling heart attack in 1967 before he could take up the post, and he withdrew. He continued to supervise the EMI recordings made by his wife, but the breach with the company was complete when in 1977 and 1979 he produced her last recordings not for EMI but for Decca, EMI's great rival.Schwarzkopf, p. 288 Legge died in Saint-Jean-Cap-Ferrat, France, at the age of 72. He was cremated, and his ashes were initially placed near those of Hugo Wolf in Vienna, as he had requested.Richard Davis, Geoffrey Parsons: Among Friends, p. 149 After Elisabeth Schwarzkopf's death in 2006, their ashes were buried next to her parents in Zumikon near Z√ºrich, where she had lived from 1982 to 2003. Musical legacy Legge's artistic judgment was sometimes questioned. He was aesthetically conservative; he wrote to a friend, \\"If producers and scenic designers are allowed to continue their writing of graffiti and vulgarity and stupidity on masterpieces ‚Ä¶ not to mention Ch√©reau at Bayreuth ‚Äì we shall be forced to insist that they write the libretto and music to match the rubbish they put on the stage!\\" Legge predicted to John Culshaw and Georg Solti that their Decca recording of Das Rheingold would not sell; it became a classical best-seller.Culshaw p. 91 He was responsible for three recordings of The Magic Flute, conducted by Beecham, Karajan and Klemperer, each of which has incurred the disapproval of critics for omitting the spoken dialogue.See, for example, Hope-Wallace, Philip, \\"Die Zauberfl√∂te\\", Gramophone, November 1964, p. 66 His recording of Fidelio under Klemperer has been compared unfavourably with Klemperer's contemporaneous live recording from Covent Garden, on the grounds that Legge's chosen singers were less effective than their ROH rivals.Blyth, Alan, \\"Fidelio\\", Gramophone, February 2004, p. 81 He was suspicious of stereo recording, and resisted it for as long as he could.Keener, Andrew, \\"News and Views\\", Gramophone, March 1985, p. 7 Nevertheless Legge's legacy is \\"a vast number of outstanding recordings that set standards unlikely ever to be surpassed\\". His recordings of The Dream of Gerontius (Sargent), Tristan und Isolde (Furtw√§ngler), Tosca (De Sabata), Der Rosenkavalier and Falstaff (Karajan), Cos√¨ fan tutte (B√∂hm) and the core German symphonic repertory (Klemperer, Furtw√§ngler, Karajan‚Ä¶) have remained in the catalogue for decades, first on LP and then on CD.

It is often described as the color of the sky on a clear day., On the RGB color wheel, \\"azure\\" (hexadecimal #007FFF) is defined as the color at 210 degrees, i.e., the hue halfway between blue and cyan. In the RGB color model, used to create all the colors on a television or computer screen, azure is created by adding a little green light to blue light. The complementary color of azure is orange. In the X11 color system, which became a standard for early web colors, azure is depicted as a pale cyan or white cyan. Etymology and history A slab of lapis lazuli, the mineral from which azure took its name The color azure ultimately takes its name from the intense blue mineral lapis lazuli. ' is the Latin word for \\"stone\\" and ' is the genitive form of the Medieval Latin ', which is taken from the Arabic lƒÅzaward, itself from the Persian lƒÅ≈æaward, which is the name of the stone in PersianOxford English Dictionary and also of a place where lapis lazuli was mined. The name of the stone came to be associated with its color. The French ', the Italian ', the Polish ', Romanian ' and ', the Portuguese and Spanish ', Hungarian ', and the Catalan atzur, all come from the name and color of lapis lazuli. The word was adopted into English from the French, and the first recorded use of it as a color name in English was in 1374 in Geoffrey Chaucer's work Troilus and Criseyde, where he refers to \\"a broche, gold and asure\\" (a brooch, gold and azure).Maerz and Paul A Dictionary of Color New York:1930 McGraw-Hill Page 190. Also Azure @ Dictionary.Reference.com. Also Azur @ CNRTL.fr (in french). Azure also describes the color of the mineral azurite, both in its natural form and as a pigment in various paint formulations. In order to preserve its deep color, azurite was ground coarsely. Fine-ground azurite produces a lighter, washed-out color. Traditionally, the pigment was considered unstable in oil paints, and was sometimes isolated from other colors and not mixed. The use of the term spread through the practice of heraldry, where \\"azure\\" represents a blue color in the system of tinctures. In engravings, it is represented as a region of parallel horizontal lines, or by the abbreviation az. or b. In practice, azure has been represented by any number of shades of blue. In later heraldic practice a lighter blue, called bleu celeste (\\"sky blue\\"), is sometimes specified. Distinction among indigo, azure and cyan According to the logic of the RGB color wheel, indigo colors are those colors with hue codes between 255 and 225 (degrees), azure colors are those colors with hue codes between 195 and 225, and cyan colors are those colors with hue codes between 165 and 195. Another way of describing it could be that cyan is a mixture of blue and green light, azure is a mixture of blue and cyan light, and indigo is a mixture of blue and violet light. All of the colors shown below in the section shades of azure are referenced as having a hue between 195 and 225 degrees, with the exception of the very pale X11 web color azure ‚Äì RGB (240, 255, 255) ‚Äì which, with a hue of 180 degrees, is a tone of cyan, but follows the artistic meaning of azure as sky blue.

Schonely (born June 1, 1929), nicknamed \\"The Schonz\\", is an American sports broadcaster who was the play-by-play announcer for the Portland Trail Blazers for almost three decades, from the team's launch in 1970 until 1998. A native of Pennsylvania, he worked in radio in Louisiana and Seattle before settling in Portland, Oregon. In addition to his work for the Blazers, he has been a sportscaster for Major League Baseball games, several minor league baseball teams, college sports, National Hockey League games, and junior ice hockey. Background and military career Schonely was born in Norristown, Pennsylvania, the firstborn child of Walter and Juanita Schonely. A stutterer as a child, Schonely worked on a weekly high school informational radio show on WNAR in Norristown, which led to opportunities at radio and television stations in Philadelphia. Upon graduation, he enlisted in the United States Marine Corps and was sent to Guam. While stationed overseas, Schonely transferred to Armed Forces Radio, where he was a disc jockey as well as doing news, sports and interviews. He also did his first play-by-play, calling military football and baseball games. In 1951, Schonely was reassigned to Quantico, Virginia, where he worked on the weekly base newspaper and emceed military events and parades under the guidance of General Clifton B. Cates. Among his duties were escorting military celebrities to New York City, Washington, D.C. and Philadelphia for radio and TV interviews. Early career =Baton Rouge= Upon leaving the Marines, Schonely followed a job offer to WAFB radio and TV in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, where he served in a variety of on-air roles. He covered sports for the radio station, covering the minor league baseball team Baton Rouge Red Sticks and the LSU Tigers football and basketball teams as well as some rodeo events. WAFB promoted a weekly wrestling match, and Schonely became the ring announcer. Schonely filled in as a referee, which eventually led to participating in matches on a tag team. =Seattle= Schonely moved to Seattle in 1956 and joined KOMO radio and then moved over to KOMO-TV, where he worked with future ABC Sports broadcaster Keith Jackson. Once again, Schonely found work in professional wrestling, although he did not pursue it as a career. Schonely also called roller derby games for KTNT-TV. In 1957, Schonely suggested to Keith Allen, then player- coach for the Seattle Totems of the Western Hockey League, that their games be televised and that he should call them. A skeptical Allen agreed, if Schonely could find sponsors. Schonely enlisted friends including a funeral home director, optometrist and restaurateur to sponsor, and KOMO-TV broadcast Totems games on Sunday nights. Schonely called Totems games for 11 years on television and radio, and the team became popular in Seattle for a time. In one incident during a game against the San Francisco Seals at the Cow Palace, an obnoxious fan would hit a siren every time the Seals made a good play, and eventually held the siren up to Schonely's ear. Going to a commercial, Schonely announced: \\"By the time I get back on the air, this guy is going to have a knuckle sandwich.\\" Schonely put his headset down, turned around and slugged him. Security took the man away, and Schonely returned to the air, saying: \\"He got his knuckle sandwich, folks.\\" Schonely moved to KAYO radio in 1959, and the Totems came with him. However, the station switched to a country and western format, and Schonely left the station. Schonely worked as public relations director for Longacres Race Track before returning to broadcasting as sports director for KVI. Schonely brought the Totems to the station, called games for the Washington Huskies and baseball games for the Pacific Coast League Seattle Angels. At that time, the PCL stretched from Hawaii to Little Rock, and the station could not cover all games. Instead, Schonely would receive updates from a reporter at the game via teletype, play sound effects to simulate crowd noise, and call the game as if he were actually present. In 1967, Schonely did West Coast National Hockey League coverage for CBS. Schonely also called major league Seattle Pilots games for the one year they played before moving to Milwaukee. In 1967, Schonely nearly became the radio voice for the Seattle SuperSonics, newly created by NBA expansion. Dick Vertlieb, the team's first general manager, offered the job to Schonely, who was not an avid NBA fan then. Schonely accepted, but was pushed aside at the behest of Union Oil of California, a key sponsor who wanted Bob Blackburn, who was the Sonics' radio voice until the early 1990s. Portland Trail Blazers =Early years= In April 1970, Schonely was approached by Blazers co-founder Harry Glickman, whom Schonely knew as a founder of the Portland Buckaroos. Schonely was the organization's sixth hire. Said Glickman in a 2008 interview: \\"The interview only lasted a few minutes; he opened his mouth and I knew I had the right guy.\\" Schonely moved to Portland to start with the team on July 1, 1970. Schonely's first task was to assemble a radio network, starting with Portland's KOIN as the flagship, and Blazer games were carried on six stations during the first year. Schonely was not as familiar with basketball as with other sports, and had to work hard to learn the game, attending every practice early on. Schonely called the play-by-play on 2,522 Blazers radio and television broadcasts, from Portland's very first preseason outing (September 24, 1970) to the team's appearance in the 1998 NBA Playoffs (April 30, 1998). Schonely's announcing streak was interrupted only once, when he missed the first 25 games of the 1982‚Äì83 season for heart bypass surgery following a heart attack. In 2003, Schonely returned to the team to appear in radio and television segments and act as a team ambassador at charity and community events. =Return to the Blazers= In 2003, Schonely was rehired by the Trail Blazers' new management, a move aimed at reconnecting with Blazers fans disenchanted by the previous management and players' off-court troubles. Schonely's role included hosting pre-game segments, \\"Memorable Moments\\" on television and \\"Blazers Flashback\\" on radio, plus appearances in advertisements and at community events. Team president Steve Patterson called the move \\"smart business\\" and intended to honor the team's past. The move followed general manager Bob Whitsitt's resignation in May. Asked whether he would have responded had the call come from Whitsitt, Schonely said at the time, \\"Probably not.\\" On October 14, 2009, at age 80, Schonely returned to the microphone for the second half of a \\"throwback\\" exhibition game held at Portland's Memorial Coliseum, where the Blazers played from 1970 until 1995. The occasion was billed as a one-quarter tribute, but radio announcer Brian Wheeler let Schonely call the remainder of the game. Schonely's Trail Blazers business card reads, \\"Ambassador\\". Portland Beavers In 2000, Schonely signed a five-year deal to be the play-by-play announcer with the newest incarnation of the Portland Beavers Triple-A franchise, relocated from Albuquerque, New Mexico. Like the original Blazers job, the Beavers offer came from Harry Glickman, this time on behalf of then-Beavers owner Portland Family Entertainment, run by Glickman's son. Schonely, who allowed that he was open to a future role with the Blazers, called games for the Beavers through the 2002 PCL season. While announcing Beavers games, Schonely made use of his famous phrases. Adapted for baseball use, \\"Lickety brindle up the middle\\" meant a base hit going past the pitcher's mound into center field, \\"Bingo, bango, bongo\\" was used on 5‚Äì4‚Äì3 double plays. More occasionally, Schonely deployed \\"Rip City\\" for an outstanding and important play. Other work Schonely has recorded television advertisements for Standard TV & Appliance and other businesses in the Portland area and has served as emcee of the former Fred Meyer Challenge charity golf tournament. Popularity Schonely with former Trail Blazer Mike Harper at a 2013 benefit event According to Oregon sportswriter Kerry Eggers, fans consider Schonely \\"the one constant link with Oregon's only major-league team.\\" NBA trainer Ron Culp said of Schonely in 1990, \\"Bill Schonely is the symbol of the love affair the fans have with the Trail Blazers. ... He's part of their immediate family. Everything else with the Blazers have changed over the past 20 years, but you just don't mess with the Schonz.\\" Schonely is often compared to legendary announcers Chick Hearn and Johnny Most, of the Los Angeles Lakers and Boston Celtics, respectively. At Schonely's induction to the 2002 Oregon Sports Hall of Fame, former Blazers center Bill Walton said: \\"Bill Schonely is as important to sports in the Northwest as Chick Hearn was to sports in Southern California. There are very few people in the history of Western Civilization who have had that kind of an impact.\\" Walton also said: \\"Bill Schonely is the most important figure in the history of Oregon sports, with all due respect to Phil Knight and Maurice Lucas. Bill Schonely is the man who convinced people that sports are worthwhile.\\" A restaurant in the Rose Garden is named in his honor, the Pyramid Taproom at Schonely's Place. The Trail Blazers organization retired Schonely's microphone on November 3, 2003. The 1992 Public Enemy album Greatest Misses features the voice of Schonely calling Trail Blazer games, on the track \\"Air Hoodlum.\\" =Signature phrases= Schonely coined or popularized numerous phrases and sayings during his radio career with the Blazers, which have become synonymous with the Blazermania phenomenon in Oregon, including \\"Rip City\\", \\"Bingo Bango Bongo\\", \\"Climb the golden ladder\\", \\"Lickety brindle up the middle\\" and \\"You've got to make your free throws.\\" Schonely's best-known phrase, \\"Rip City\\", debuted in a game against the Lakers in 1970. The Blazers had fallen behind by a significant margin, yet rallied back to a two-point deficit. When a long jump shot by guard Jim Barnett tied the game, Schonely blurted out, \\"Rip City! All right!\\" an exhortation for which Schonely had no literal explanation. The Blazers lost 136‚Äì114 but the phrase stuck, became synonymous with Blazers basketball and even became a nickname for Portland itself. Schonely is also known for the opening line of each broadcast, \\"Good evening basketball fans, wherever you may be...\\" delivered in some variation since the beginning of his professional sportscasting career in Baton Rouge. =Recognition= In 1999, Schonely was inducted into the Oregon Sports Hall of Fame for Broadcasting. In 2012, Schonely was awarded the Curt Gowdy Media Award from the Basketball Hall of Fame. Personal life Schonely's philanthropic work includes association with the American Heart Association, Life Flight, Cystic Fibrosis Foundation and Providence Child Center Foundation. Schonely sings in his church choir, plays golf, and likes to listen to big-band music. He has four children from his first marriage. He married his second wife Dottie in 1992.

The flowers are trumpet-shaped, 3‚Äì10 cm diameter, white or pink, with (in most species) a sometimes inflated basal epicalyx. The genus bears much similarity to a related genus Convolvulus, and is sometimes combined with it; it is distinguished primarily by the pollen being smooth, and in the ovary being unilocular. Some of the species, notably Calystegia sepium and C. silvatica, are problematic weeds, which can swamp other more valuable plants by climbing over them, but some are also deliberately grown for their attractive flowers. Calystegia species are used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species including Bedellia somnulentella (recorded on C. sepium) and small angle shades. The name is derived from two Greek words kalux, \\"cup\\", and stege, \\"a covering\\", meaning \\"a covering cup\\". .: Merriam-Webster dictionary:Calystegia] Species The following species are recognised in the genus Calystegia: *Calystegia affinis *Calystegia atriplicifolia ‚Äì nightblooming false bindweed *Calystegia binghamiae *Calystegia brummittii *Calystegia catesbiana ‚Äì Catesby's false bindweed *Calystegia collina ‚Äì Coast Range false bindweed *Calystegia felix *Calystegia hederacea ‚Äì Japanese false bindweed *Calystegia √ó howittiorum *Calystegia √ó krauseana *Calystegia longipes ‚Äì Paiute false bindweed, plateau morning glory *Calystegia √ó lucana *Calystegia macaunii ‚Äì Macoun's false bindweed *Calystegia macrostegia ‚Äì island false bindweed *Calystegia malacophylla ‚Äì sierra false bindweed *Calystegia marginata ‚Äì small-flowered white bindweed New Zealand *Calystegia √ó melnikovae *Calystegia occidentalis ‚Äì chaparral false bindweed *Calystegia peirsonii ‚Äì Peirson's false bindweed *Calystegia pellita ‚Äì hairy false bindweed *Calystegia pubescens *Calystegia √ó pulchra ‚Äì hairy bindweed *Calystegia purpurata ‚Äì Pacific false bindweed *Calystegia √ó scania *Calystegia sepium ‚Äì large bindweed, hedge bindweed, bearbind, hedgebell (type species) *Calystegia silvatica ‚Äì great bindweed, shortstalk bindweed *Calystegia soldanella ‚Äì sea bindweed, seashore false bindweed, beach morning glory *Calystegia spithamaea ‚Äì low false bindweed, upright bindweed *Calystegia stebbinsii ‚Äì Stebbins' false bindweed, Stebbins' morning glory *Calystegia subacaulis ‚Äì hillside false bindweed *Calystegia tuguriorum ‚Äì New Zealand bindweed, p≈çuwhiwhi, p≈çwhiwhi, rarotawakeNew Zealand bindweed *Calystegia vanzuukiae File:DSCM1934_Helix_Zaunwinde.jpg File:Flore des serres et des jardins de l'Europe (8595873042).jpgCalystegia sepium (van Houtte, L., 1853) References *Flora of China: Calystegia External links * Category:Convolvulaceae genera Category:Taxa named by Robert Brown (botanist, born 1773) ","title":"Calystegia"},{"id":"864868","text":"is a district located in Saitama Prefecture, Japan.

This type of parrot is generally called a conure in aviculture. It is native to the forests of South America.  Description  The green-cheeked conure is typically long and weighs 60 to 80 g. It is mainly green, with a brown/black/grey crown, white periophthalmic rings, green cheeks, blue primary wing feathers, a grey beak, and its long pointed tail is mostly maroon. It has short transverse striations on its breast and a red abdominal area. Males and females have an identical external appearance.  Taxonomy  The green-cheeked conure has six subspecies:Forshaw (2006). plate 85. * Pyrrhura molinae, (Massena & Souance 1854) ** P. m. australis, Todd 1915 ** P. m. flavoptera, Maijer, Herzog, Kessler, Friggens & Fjeldsa 1998 ** P. m. hypoxantha,(Salvadori 1899) ** P. m. molinae, (Massena & Souance 1854) ** P. m. phoenicura, (Schlegel 1864) ** P. m. restricta, Todd 1947 P. m. sordida naturally occurs as a common green morph or as a rare yellow morph (which however is more frequent in captivity).Collar, N.J. (1997). Green-cheeked Conure (Pyrrhura molinae), page 440 in: del Hoyo, J.; Elliott, A.; and Sargatal, J., eds. (1997). Handbook of the Birds of the World. Vol. 4. Sandgrouses to Cuckoos. Lynx Edicions, Barcelona. Berlo, B.V. (2009). A Field Guide to the Birds of Brazil. Pages 126‚Äì127. Oxford University Press, New York. The yellow morph is also called the yellow-sided conure and was once erroneously considered to be a separate species, P. hypoxantha. As P. hypoxantha was described before P. m. sordida the older name goes first, therefore P. m. sordida is called P. m. hypoxantha these days. The green- cheeked conure is similar to the maroon-bellied parakeet (P. frontalis), and formerly there have been speculations that they were conspecific. It is also similar in appearance to the blaze-winged parakeet and the black-capped parakeet.  Distribution and habitat  The green-cheeked conure occurs in west-central and southern Mato Grosso, Brazil, northern and eastern Bolivia, northwestern Argentina, and western Paraguay. Its habitat is forests and woodland, where it usually forms flocks of 10 to 20 individuals at treetop level, or larger flocks where there is more food. It is also emerging as a popular pet for families and individuals.Forshaw (2006). page 114.  Diet and behavior  Scratching the neck with a corn cob, an example of tool use. The green-cheeked conure eats various seeds, vegetables and fruits. The average clutch is 4‚Äì6 eggs. Average incubation is 25 days, varying from 22 to 25 days. They are the quietest of the conures and can learn tricks and have a limited vocabulary, with extensive training.  Aviculture  A wing-clipped adult yellow-sided green-cheeked parrot, yellow morph P. m. sordida. Note the lighter coloration. Green-cheeked parrots are common in aviculture and are popular companion parrots. They are playful, affectionate and intelligent, known as having a \\"big personality in a small body\\". They can learn to talk, albeit with a limited vocabulary and a gravelly voice. They like to be held (although some like it more than others) and can learn tricks such as lying on their backs, \\"kissing,\\" shaking, hanging upside down and even can be potty trained. Green-cheeked parrots are not very loud at most times, so even an apartment dweller can enjoy their companionship. They can be prone to biting, particularly when young, but an owner can cure this behavior with patience and time. They love fruits, (especially bananas and raisins), and seeds such as sunflower, safflower, and hemp seeds‚Äîall found in their natural environments. Green-cheeked parrots also love table food‚Äîthey are flock animals and love to eat with their family. They can eat potatoes, carrots, corn, bread, pasta, and plain popcorn. A clipped and/or caged bird can become obese from eating too many fatty seeds such as sunflower seeds and peanuts. A bird-pellet diet with a calcium supplement provides proper nutrition and should comprise 60‚Äì70% of their diet. An ideal diet is 70% pellet, 20% fruit and vegetables and <10% treat items. Parrots with health problems related to the kidneys should not be fed a high protein diet, as it may lead to gout; veterinarian prescribed low- protein diets are available for birds with such conditions. Green-cheeked parrots can live to 30 years with proper care, though the average lifespan is typically 10 years due to owner neglect. = Color Variations = In addition to the natural color forms, color varieties have been selectively bred in aviculture: * Cinnamon are lime green and have a lighter, almost pale color to the feathers. The head is tan and the tail feathers are a lighter maroon than in normal green-cheeked parrots. * Yellow-sided have a breast of bright colors and, rarely, have a bright yellow feather on each side of the upper wing. This is a rare recessive character of which only one hatchling in approximately 10 clutches can be found to have. This appearance can increase their value. * Pineapple is cinnamon and yellow-sided combination. They have a breast of bright colors, a tan head and lime green feathers on the back like a cinnamon green-cheeked parrot. The tail feathers are the same as a yellow-sided, showing a halo effect. * Turquoise have a body with some blue-green and green feathers. The end of the wing feathers have a highly iridescent quality if left unclipped. The breast feathers are grayish and the tail feathers are gray.

His collaboration with Charles Darwin on The Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals has assured him a position in the history of behavioural science and psychiatry.  Biography  According to his naturalisation papers, Rejlander was born in Stockholm on October 19, 1813. He was the son of Carl Gustaf Rejlander, a stonemason and Swedish Army Officer. During his youth, his family moved to the Swedish-speaking community in Rauma, Finland (then Russia). In the 1830s, he relocated to England, initially settling in Lincoln, England. In the 1850s he abandoned his original profession as a painter and portrait miniaturist, apparently after seeing how well a photograph captured the fold of a sleeve. He set up as a portraitist in the industrial Midlands town of Wolverhampton, probably around 1846. In the early 1850s he learned the wet-collodion and waxed-paper processes at great speed with Nicholas Henneman in London, and then changed his business to that of a photography studio. He undertook genre work and portraiture. Rejlander also produced nude studies, mainly for use as studies by painters, and later revealed that his early work was made with the aid of a local troupe of theatrical performers. Hard Times, c.1860 Rejlander undertook many experiments to perfect his photography, including combination printing, which he did not invent; however, he created more elaborate and convincing composite photographs than any prior photographer. He had articles feature in the Wolverhampton Chronicle newspaper, on 15 November 1854 an article called \\"Improvement in Calotypes, by Mr. O.G. Rejlander, of Wolverhampton\\" it suggests that by 1854 he was experimenting with combination printing from several negatives. He was a friend of photographer Charles Lutwidge Dodgson (better known by the nom de plume Lewis Carroll), who collected Rejlander's work and corresponded with him on technical matters. Rejlander later created one of the best known and most revealing portraits of Dodgson. Like Dodgson, Rejlander's work included many pictures of \\"undraped\\" children: :\\"The remarks of his contemporaries bear witness to both his attainments and to the influence which he exercised. Some of his critics were exuberant. Thus one speaks of his undraped children as being as 'beautiful as those of Della Robbia, Flamingo, and Raphael.' Mr. H. Robinson, the immediate successor to Rejlander, who was also for many years a rival in seeking public applause for genre photography, calls the foregoing 'wonderful pictures of nude children.'\\"Hector Maclean, \\"The Photographic Pictorialists of Great Britain: Oscar G, Rejlander\\", Camera Obscura 1899, page 597. However his 'Charlotte Baker' photograph is now said to be a forgery, produced by Graham Ovenden Ovenden's friend Howard Grey in the 1970s, rephotographed and printed to look antique by Ovenden. The Two Ways of Life, a moralistic photo montage of Rejlanders own work, 1857 Rejlander participated in the Paris Exhibition of 1855. In 1856 he made his best-known allegorical work, The Two Ways of Life. This was a seamlessly montaged combination print made of thirty-two images (akin to the use of Photoshop today, but then far more difficult to achieve) in about six weeks. First exhibited at the Manchester Art Treasures Exhibition of 1857, the work shows a man being lured to paths of vice or virtue by good and bad angels. The image's partial nudity, which showed real women as they actually appeared and not the idealised forms then common in Victorian art, was deemed 'indecent' by some. Rejlander was also accused of using prostitutes as models, although Rejlander categorically denied this and no proof was ever offered. Reservations about the work subsided when Queen Victoria ordered a 10-guinea copy to give to Prince Albert. Victoria and Albert would go on to purchase three copies of the work, all of which are now lost. Despite this royal patronage, controversy about The Two Ways of Life in Scotland in 1858 led to a secession of a large group from the Photographic Society of Scotland, the secessionists founding the Edinburgh Photographic Society in 1861. They objected to the picture being shown with one half of it concealed by drapes. The picture was also shown at the Birmingham Photographic Society with no such furor or censorship. However the Photographic Society of Scotland later made amends and invited Rejlander to a grand dinner in his honour in 1866, held to open an exhibition that included many of his pictures. Portrait of Alfred Tennyson, 1st Baron Tennyson, 1862 Rejlander moved his studio to Malden Road, London around 1862 and largely abandoned his early experiments with double exposure, photomontage, photographic manipulation and retouching. Instead, he became one of Britain's leading portraitists, creating pictures with psychological charge. He became a leading expert in photographic techniques, lecturing and publishing widely, and sold work through bookshops and art dealers. He also found subject-matter in London, photographing homeless London street children to produce popular 'social-protest' pictures such as \\"Poor Joe,\\" also known as \\"Homeless\\". Charles Lutwidge Dodgson visited Rejlander's Malden Road studio in 1863. Carroll was in the process of relocating his studio and sought Rejlander's advice regarding its design. Around 1863 Rejlander visited the Isle of Wight at the request of Julia Margaret Cameron and helped teach her photography. Some of Rejlander's images were purchased as drawing-aids by Victorian painters of repute, such as Sir Lawrence Alma- Tadema. In 1871 he contributed photographs to Darwin's classic treatise on The Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals.  Personal life  Happy Days, a portrait of Rejlander and Mary Bull, taken by Rejlander, c.1872 Rejlander married Mary Bull in 1862, who was twenty-four years his junior. Mary had been his photographic model in Wolverhampton. Rejlander became seriously ill from about 1874. He died in 1875 with several claims on his estate, and costly funeral expenses. The Edinburgh Photographic Society raised money for his widow on Rejlander's death, and helped set up the Rejlander Memorial Fund.  References   Further reading  * David Elliott (Ed.)

It is approximately 157 kilometres north of Durban, in hilly countryside, overlooking a flat coastal plain and the major harbour town of Richards Bay 16 kilometres away. The N2 freeway runs east from Empangeni intersecting John Ross Highway (R34) which connects Empangeni and Richards Bay. The climate is sub-tropical with an average temperature of 28.4 ¬∞C in summer and 14.5 ¬∞C in Winter. The town is said, by local residents, to not have a real winter, as temperatures are seldom very low. History =Humble Beginnings= In 1851, the Norwegian Missionary Society established a mission station on the banks of the eMpangeni river. The river was named after the profusion of Mpange trees (Trema guineensis) growing along its banks. The mission was later moved to Eshowe, 61 kilometres north-west. In 1894 a magistracy was established. The Zululand Railway reached the town in January 1903 and linked the area to Durban and Eshowe. The government planted eucalyptus trees in 1905 as part of an experimental timber plantation. The plantation was a success and led to a large scale planting along the coastal belt. In 1906 Empangeni became a village. Rapid expansion began when a sugar mill was erected at Felixton. The establishment of the Empangeni Sugar Mill set the area on the road to rapid development. Empangeni was officially proclaimed as a township on 15 January 1931 and declared a borough on 13 October 1960. =The Reign of the Hammerman= In the early 1980's Simon Mpungose terrorised the citizens of Empangeni during his spree of violent murders. The 35-year-old Mpungose was given the name ‚ÄòHammerman‚Äô because he would break into homes in the dead of night and kill the occupants with a hammer before robbing them of their possessions. When he was brought to trial in November 1984, shortly after his arrest that same year, the Empangeni court was told that Mpungose attacked many other people during violent robberies, but never touched the children of his victims. During the trial Mpungose stated that he wanted to die as he had a hard life, complicated by the actions of people who did not understand his plight. He sentenced him to hang, whereupon Mpungose threw his blue tracksuit into the public gallery, shouted, and threatened to expose his penis to the court before he was restrained with handcuffs. He was hanged a year later on Friday, 29 November 1985 in Pretoria.

It is an overview of parties that adhere to some form of liberalism and is therefore a list of liberal parties around the world. Introduction The definition of liberal party is highly debatable. In the list below, it is defined as a political party that adheres to the basic principles of political liberalism. This is a broad political current, including left-wing, centrist and right-wing elements. All liberal parties emphasise individual rights, but they differ in their opinion on an active role for the state. This list includes parties of different character, ranging from classical liberalism to social liberalism, conservative liberalism to national liberalism. Several conservative and/or Christian-democratic parties, such as the British Conservative Party, Germany's Christian Democratic Union and Spain's People's Party, are also considered to be neoliberal leaning or have strong liberal conservative and/or classical liberal factions, whereas some conservative parties, such as Poland's Law and Justice and Hungary's Fidesz, while favour more state intervention also support free market/free market solutions. Conversely, some social-democratic parties, such as the British Labour Party and the Italian Democratic Party, include liberal elements. Social liberalism and social conservatism are not mutually exclusive either, in fact some parties espouse socially liberal economic policies, while maintaining more socially conservative or traditionalist views on society: examples of this include Finland's Centre Party (see also Nordic agrarian parties) and Ireland's Fianna F√°il, both members of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe Party (ALDE Party). In the United States, the two major political forces, the Republican Party and the Democratic Party, are to some extent, liberal (see Liberalism in the United States and Modern liberalism in the United States). Many liberal parties are members of the Liberal International and/or one of its regional partners, such as the ALDE Party in Europe, the Liberal Network for Latin America and the Council of Asian Liberals and Democrats. Generally, membership in these international organizations is an indication that that party is indeed liberal. However, other international organisations, such as the International Democrat Union and the Centrist Democrat International, and regional organisations, such as the European People's Party, the Alliance of European Conservatives and Reformists, the European Democratic Party and the Christian Democrat Organization of America, also have liberal or liberal leaning parties as significant proportions of their membership. Not all the parties using the \\"Liberal\\" or \\"Freedom\\" labels are actually liberal. Moreover, some parties, such as the Freedom Party of Austria, were originally liberal, but have since tilted toward a populist direction and abandoned most of the tenets of liberalism. Finally, some parties, such as the United States Republican Party, Australia's Liberal Party or Norway's Progress Party are liberal mainly from an economic point of view (see economic liberalism, libertarianism and right-libertarianism). International organizations of parties * Liberal International * Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe Party * Liberal Network for Latin America * Council of Asian Liberals and Democrats * Africa Liberal Network * Arab Alliance for Freedom and Democracy Parliamentary parties and other parties with substantial support :This list includes also parties that were represented in the last previous legislature and still exists as well as some banned or exiles parties (Cuba). Liberals might be active in other parties, but that is no reason to include a party. :See the remarks above about the criteria. Minor parties are listed below =Africa= Liberalism is a relatively new current for Africa. Traditionally it only existed more or less in Egypt, Senegal and especially South Africa. * There are very few liberal political parties in Algeria. Ahd 54 and the Algerian Natural Law Party may be considered liberal.

There were allegations that members of the former governing UDF did not adequately tackle corruption. It is unclear if the party will be ideological or personalist in style. * In Morocco, two center-right parties, the Constitutional Union (Union Constitutionnelle) and the Popular Movement (Mouvement Populaire) are both member of the LI.

At times, the anti-clerical and secularist stances promoted by Latin American liberals have resulted in limitations on the civil rights of clergy or others associated with the Church (as in Mexico, where law still prohibits priests from public office). Liberalism in North America has a different background. * In Argentina, the Radical Civic Union historically was a centrist progressive-liberal party, while nowadays it adheres to the Socialist International and its platform is a combination of liberal and social democratic ideas. The UCR's long-time rivals have been Peronism and the Peronist-inspired Justicialist Party. Recreate for Growth had been a short lived attempt to form a market liberal party and has observer status in the Liberal International. This party was in alliance with conservative-liberal Republican Proposal. Also smaller parties, such as the Union of the Democratic Centre, the Progressive Democratic Party, the Liberal Party of Corrientes and the Democratic Party of Mendoza, adhere to conservative-liberal principles. On the libertarian side, stands the Liberal Libertarian Party (dissolved) and the Libertarian Party (now) whose focus is on free markets and individual rights. * In Aruba, the character of the Aruban Liberal Organization (Organisacion Liberal Arubiano) is not clear.

While at least three parties label themselves as \\"liberal\\", the Liberal Front Party (Partido da Frente Liberal), renamed Democrats (Democratas\\"') in 2007, is actually a conservative party. The Liberal Party (Partido Liberal), renamed Party of the Republic (Partido da Rep√∫blica) in 2006, is a populist-conservative party with links to religious organizations, and the Social Liberal Party (Partido Social Liberal) is a conservative party. (Main article: Liberalism in Brazil).'' * In Canada, Liberal refers mainly to the policies and ideas of the Liberal Party of Canada/Parti Lib√©ral du Canada (member LI), the most frequent governing party of Canada for the last century and one of the most successful liberal parties in the world. The Liberal Party of Canada has generally adhered to modern liberalism, supporting a welfare state, and is regarded as a centrist to centre-left party in the Canadian context although some provincial parties such as the British Columbia Liberal Party and Quebec Liberal Party combine liberalism with conservative ideas. (Main article: Liberalism in Canada). * In Chile, originally the Social Democrat Radical Party (Partido Radical Social- Democr√°ta, member SI) was a left of center liberal party, but nowadays it is a social democratic party.

Other parties as the Popular Action (Acci√≥n Popular) and the Union for Peru (Uni√≥n por el Per√∫) are more or less liberal parties. (Main article: Liberalism in Peru). * In Puerto Rico, the Popular Democratic Party (Partido Popular Democr√°tico) is a left of center liberal party. * In Suriname, the Democratic Alternative '91 (Democratisch Alternatief '91) is a center liberal party. * In Trinidad and Tobago, the People's National Movement is a liberal centrist to centre-left party. * In the United States, the primary use of the term liberal is at some variance with European and worldwide usage. In the United States today, it is most associated with the definition of modern liberalism, which is a combination of social liberalism, public welfare and a mixed economy,\\"Liberalism in America: A Note for Europeans\\" by Arthur Schlesinger, Jr. (1956)from: The Politics of Hope (Boston: Riverside Press, 1962). which is in contrast to classical liberalism. In the 19th century it was not a common term in American philosophy or politics, partially because the two main parties were a mixture of populist and nationalist elements. (\\"Conservatism\\" was not a common term until the mid-20th century as well.) The Democratic Party was the party of free trade, low tariffs and laissez-faire entrepreneurialism, while the Republican Party advocated national citizenship, transparency and government efforts to stabilize the currency. Liberalism in the United States was primarily defined by the self-proclaimed liberal presidents Woodrow Wilson and Franklin Roosevelt. While the emphasis on mutual collaboration through liberal institutions as an alternative to the threat and use of force remained consistent with international liberalism, United States liberals also claimed that individuals have a right to expect the government to guarantee social justice. This was in part a consequence of the influence of the ideas of British economist John Maynard Keynes on Franklin D. Roosevelt's New Deal. The New Deal had the effect of stealing the thunder of social democratic forces and the necessity to prevent social unrest strengthened this development. As the term socialism was (and is still) commonly perceived as communistic (as in the ideology of the USSR), many to the left of center moderated their views, aligning with the New Deal liberals. The Democratic Party is identified as the liberal party within the broader definition of liberalism thus putting it in contrast with most other parties listed here. Democrats advocate more social freedoms, affirmative action, and a mixed economy (and therefore modern liberalism). The Republican Party experiences a somewhat fractured economic viewpoint with some members supporting strong free-market and libertarian views (and therefore economic liberalism) and others championing pro-business stances, though both sectors typically mix their fiscal views with strong aspects of social conservatism. The Libertarian Party is the third largest political party in the United States, (though still only getting 1‚Äì2% of the vote in congressional elections), and particularly centers itself on free markets and individual liberty, which is more in line with classical liberalism. (Main article: Liberalism in the United States and Modern liberalism in the United States) * In Uruguay, liberalism organized itself in the nineteenth century in the Colorado Party (Partido Colorado) nowadays a heterogeneous party, divided in factions ranging from conservative to social- democratic; however, its general profile is more or less liberal. (Main article: Liberalism in Uruguay). * In Venezuela, liberalism was a strong force in the nineteenth and beginning of the twentieth century. Nowadays there are three important classical liberal movements (still no parties): Organization for the Liberal Democracy in Venezuela (Organizaci√≥n por la Democracia Liberal en Venezuela), a classical liberal, pro-capitalism think-tank; Liberal Democratic Movement (Movimiento Dem√≥crata Liberal) and \\"Rumbo Propio para el Zulia\\" from Maracaibo, Zulia, a classical liberal autonomist movement. They are going to create together a political party in the next years. (Main article: Liberalism in Venezuela). =Asia= Liberalism has or had some tradition in some countries. Nowadays it is a growing current in East Asia, but in many of these countries liberals tend not to use the label liberal. :Armenia, Azerbaijan, Cyprus, Georgia, Russia, and Turkey are listed under Europe. * In Bangladesh, the Bangladesh Liberal Democratic Party is a small liberal democratic party. * In Burma, the National League for Democracy, observer CALD, a party with liberal and social democratic elements, became the biggest parliamentary party at the latest election.

The Liberal Democratic Party of Iran is forced to exist in exile (based in Sweden). (Main article: Liberalism in Iran). * In Israel, Shinui (◊©◊ô◊†◊ï◊ô, in English Change, member LI) is a strongly anti-clerical, market liberal party without parliamentary representation since 2006. One of its founders, some of its members, and many of its voters joined the new Kadima Party. The center-right Likud calls itself a \\"National-Liberal Party.\\" * In Japan, the word liberal is used by the main conservative party, the Liberal Democratic Party (Jiyu Minshuto).

Your Party was a market liberal or libertarian party. (Main article: Liberalism in Japan). * In South Korea, The current Minjoo Party of Korea (Minjudang, Democratic Party) is a social liberal center-left party.

The Taiwan Solidarity Union is a progressive-centrist party characterised primarily by its Taiwanese nationalism and derives its membership from both the Chinese Nationalist Party's former moderate and Taiwan-oriented fringe and DPP supporters disgruntled by the party's moderation on the question of Taiwanese sovereignty. Its liberal character is questionable, although it is part of the DPP's left-of-centre and pro-Taiwanese Independence Pan-Green alliance (in contrast with the conservative Chinese Nationalist Party (Kuomintang) and People First Party.) (Main article: Liberalism in Taiwan). * In Thailand, the Democrat Party (Pak Prachatipat, member LI, CALD) is a conservative-liberal party. (Main article: Liberalism in Thailand). =Europe= At a pan-European level liberalism exists in some form within generally all members of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe Party (ALDE), within most members of the European Democratic Party (EDP), within many members of the European People's Party (EPP) and some members of the Alliance of European Conservatives and Reformists (AECR). * In Albania, liberalism is weak. Two parties could be considered to embrace liberal values: the Democratic Alliance Party (Partia Aleanca Demokratike, member LI, ALDE) and the Unity for Human Rights Party (Partia Bashkimi p√´r t√´ Drejtat e Njeriut), which is the party of the ethnic minorities. (Main article: Liberalism in Albania.) * In Andorra, the Liberal Party of Andorra (Partit Liberal d'Andorra, member LI, ALDE) is a centre-right liberal party and currently the second-largest political party by parliamentary representation. * In Armenia, traditional liberalism made a comeback following the 2018 Velvet Revolution.

In the Flemish community, Open Flemish Liberals and Democrats (member LI, ALDE), comprising both market and social liberals, is one of the dominant parties. In the French community, the centre-right Reformist Movement (member LI, ALDE) is one of the major parties. Affiliated with this party is the Party for Freedom and Progress in the German community, and until 2011 Democratic Federalist Independent a regionalist party in the Brussels region whose aim is the expansion of linguistic rights of French- speakers. (Main article: Liberalism in Belgium.) * In Bosnia-Herzegovina, liberalism is weak, because of the domination by ethnic parties. A small and rather unsuccessful liberal party is the Liberal Democratic Party (Liberalno demokratska stranka, associate ALDE). More successful is the social liberaI and multi-ethnic Our Party (Na≈°a stranka, associate ALDE). * In Bulgaria, organized liberalism was initially quite unsuccessful. Liberalism is now represented by the mainly Turkish minority party Movement for Rights and Freedoms (Dvi≈æenie za prava i svobodi, observer LI, member ALDE) and the National Movement for Stability and Progress (Nacionalno Dvi≈æenie za Stabilnost i Vazhod, member LI, ALDE), both taking a more or less liberal position. (Main article: Liberalism and radicalism in Bulgaria.) * In Croatia, liberalism is very divided. One could distinguish five parties: the centre Croatian People's Party-Liberal Democrats (Hrvatska narodna stranka ‚Äì Liberalni Demokrati, member ALDE), its two splinters: centrist People's Party - Reformists (Narodna stranka - Reformisti, member EDP) and the left of centre Civic Liberal Alliance (Graƒëansko-liberalni savez, member ALDE); left centrist and Istrian regionalist Istrian Democratic Assembly (Istarski demokratski sabor ‚Äì Dieta Democratica Istriana, member ALDE, observer LI) and the right of centre Croatian Social Liberal Party (Hrvatska socijalno liberalna stranka, member LI, ALDE). (Main article: Liberalism in Croatia). * In Cyprus, the centre-right Liberal Democrats www.liberalscy.org(Fileleftheri Dimokrates, member of the Interlibertarians) and the centre-left United Democrats (Enomeni Dimokrates, member ALDE) are considered liberal parties. See also Liberalism in Cyprus. * In the Czech Republic the Czech Pirate Party, the European Democrats (Evrop≈°t√≠ demokrat√©), the Green Party, the Mayors and Independents, the TOP 09 and the Christian and Democratic Union ‚Äì Czechoslovak People's Party are considered liberal parties. (Main article: Liberalism in the Czech lands). * In Denmark, most parties support liberalism in one form or another, and three parties mark themselves as liberal: the centrist Social Liberal Party (Det Radikale Venstre, member LI, ALDE), the much larger conservative- liberal Venstre (member LI, ALDE) and the liberal‚Äìlibertarian Liberal Alliance. (Main article: Liberalism and radicalism in Denmark). * In Estonia, the Estonian Reform Party (Eesti Reformierakond, member LI, ALDE) is a free market liberal party. The liberal character of the Estonian Centre Party (Eesti Keskerakond, member ALDE) can be disputed. (Main article: Liberalism in Estonia). * In the Faroe Islands, the conservative-liberal Union Party (Sambandsflokkurin) and the social liberal New Self-Government (N√Ωtt Sj√°lvst√Ωri) were or are aligned with the Danish liberal parties. In addition, there are two separatist parties: the liberal-conservative People's Party (F√≥lkaflokkurin, member AECR) and the market liberal Progress (Frams√≥kn), founded in 2011. * In Finland, the dominant LI and ALDE member party is the centrist and agrarian Centre Party (Suomen Keskusta), however the liberal character of this party is questioned. In actuality, the Centre Party has long since become socially more conservative than the liberal-conservative National Coalition Party, since it opted not to support same-sex marriage. The Swedish minority party Swedish People's Party (Svenska Folkpartiet i Finland, member LI, ALDE) has a clearer liberal profile. The original liberal current was until 2011 organized in the Liberals (Liberaalit), after 1995 a very small extra-parliamentary party. At the autonomous islands of √Öland the Liberals for √Öland (Liberalerna p√• √Öland) and the centrist agrarian √Ölandic Centre (√Öl√§ndsk Center, member ALDE) are the dominant forces. (Main article: Liberalism and centrism in Finland). * In France, the Radical Party of the Left (Parti radical de gauche) is a former member of ELDR but not of LI. France had an important liberal tradition, generally associated to Republicanism, from which the right and the left of the political spectrum were generated. On the right- wing there were the Republicans, which organized themselves in 1901‚Äì03 in the moderate-liberal Democratic Republican Alliance and in the liberal- conservative Republican Federation; on the left-wing the Radicals, which founded the Republican, Radical and Radical-Socialist Party in 1901. After World War II, the Republicans gathered in the liberal-conservative National Center of Independents and Peasants, from which the conservative-liberal Independent Republicans seceded in 1962. The original centre-left Radical Party was a declining force in French politics until 1972 when it joined the centre-right, causing the split of Radical-Socialist faction and the foundation of the Radical Party of the Left, closely associated to the Socialist Party. In 1978 both the Republican Party (successor of the Independent Republicans) and the Radical Party were founding components, alongside with Centre of Social Democrats, of the Union for French Democracy (UDF), an alliance of liberal and Christian-democratic forces. The Republican Party, re-founded as Liberal Democracy in 1997 and re-shaped as a free-market libertarian party, left UDF in 1998 and merged into the Gaulist Union for a Popular Movement (UMP), of which it represented the libertarian wing. Also the Radical Party left UDF in 2002 in order to join UMP, of which it is the main social-liberal component, as an associate party. In some ways we can say that the Republican tradition and the Radical one are now re-composed in UMP. Anyway, the lack of a true liberal and libertarian force in France led to the creation in 2006 of Liberal Alternative, whose chances of success are unclear. In 2017, Emmanuel Macron formed the liberal party La R√©publique En Marche! and won the presidential and the National Assembly elections. The Democratic Movement, the successor of the Union for French Democracy, joined forces with La R√©publique En Marche!. (Main article: Liberalism and radicalism in France). * In Georgia, the United National Movement (Nacionaluri Modraoba, member IDU, observer EPP) is a liberal-conservative pro-western party oriented on North- Atlantic integration.

(Main article: Liberalism in Germany). * In Gibraltar, the Liberal Party of Gibraltar (member LI, ALDE) is a social- liberal party favouring Gibraltar's self-determination. * In Greece, the liberal current disappeared, leading to liberals joining the centre-right New Democracy, est. in 1974 and the centre-left PASOK, est. in 1974, parties. Meanwhile, new liberal initiatives have been taken, like e.g. the purely liberal Liberal Alliance (Greek: ¬´Œ¶ŒπŒªŒµŒªŒµœçŒ∏ŒµœÅŒ∑ Œ£œÖŒºŒºŒ±œáŒØŒ±¬ª, Fileleftheri Simmakhia), est. in 2007 and mostly liberal Drassi (Greek: ŒîœÅŒ¨œÉŒ∑, Drassi, member ALDE), est. in 2009. In the latest parliamentary election the social- liberal The River (Greek: Œ§Œø Œ†ŒøœÑŒ¨ŒºŒπ, To Potami) and the Union of Centrists (Greek:ŒàŒΩœâœÉŒ∑ ŒöŒµŒΩœÑœÅœéœâŒΩ, Enosi Kentroon), claimer of Venizelist heritage, became the leading liberal forces (Main article: Liberalism in Greece). * In Hungary, the Alliance of Free Democrats (Szabad Demokrat√°k Sz√∂vets√©ge) was a center market liberal party. Now there are Together 2014 (Egy√ºtt 2014), a social liberal party, and the Hungarian Liberal Party (Magyar Liber√°lis P√°rt), a market liberal party, in parliament. (Main article: Liberalism and radicalism in Hungary). * In Iceland, the Progressive Party (Frams√≥knarflokkurinn, member LI) is an agrarian-centrist party. Bright Future (Bj√∂rt framt√≠√∞, member ALDE), founded in 2012, is a social-liberal party favouring Iceland's membership in the EU. In 2016, the Reform Party emerged as a liberal split from the governing Independence Party. (Main article: Liberalism and centrism in Iceland). * In Ireland, Fine Gael are a centrist, liberal-conservative party whose platform encompasses laissez-faire economic policies and socially liberal stances on issues such as same-sex marriage, abortion, and assisted dying. The Progressive Democrats were a conservative-liberal party with an emphasis on classical liberalism. In recent years the traditionally Irish nationalist centre-right Fianna F√°il ( member of LI and ALDE) has tried to rebrand itself as a liberal party, however the party membership remains conservative on social issues. * In the Isle of Man the Liberal Vannin Party (observer LI) is the only party represented in the House of Keys since most Members are elected as independents. It favours accountability and transparency in government and a further devolution from the United Kingdom. * In Italy, liberals are now divided over the centre-right Forza Italia (originally a merger of liberal and Christian-democratic forces in 1994, and reconstituted in 2013 from The People of Freedom), the Civic Choice party founded in 2013 to support then-Prime Minister Mario Monti, Democratic Centre and Alliance for Italy, small social-liberal parties, and various minor extra- parliamentary movements including the libertarian Act to Stop the Decline and Italian Radicals (member ALDE Party). Also the centrist-populist Italy of Values is a member of ALDE Party, although it is not classifiable as a liberal party in whichever sense. Most members of the late Italian Liberal Party (refounded as a very small party in 2004) and many former members of the Italian Republican Party joined Forza Italia, which is often presented and defined in Italy as a liberal party. This is the reason why the term 'liberals' is more often used when speaking of the centre-right coalition, dominated by Forza Italia, which combines economic liberalism with freedom of conscience on ethical matters. (Main article: Liberalism and radicalism in Italy). * In Kosovo, the New Kosovo Alliance (Aleanca Kosova e Re, member ALDE), Liberal Party of Kosovo (Partia Liberale e Kosoves, associate ALDE), and the Alternative (Alternativa) are considered to be liberal parties, although the second one doesn't seem to have much support. The Independent Liberal Party (Samostalna liberalna stranka, member LI) is a liberal party of the Serbian minority. * In Latvia, the Development/For! is a classical-liberal political party (member ALDE). Development/For! has 13 seats in saeima. Eliminated Latvia's First Party/Latvian Way party (member LI, ALDE) was a centre-right liberal party. (Main article: Liberalism in Latvia). * In Lithuania, the Liberal Movemant (Liberal≈≥ SƒÖj≈´dis) and the Liberal and Centre Union (Liberal≈≥ ir centro sƒÖjunga, member LI), ALDE) are a center liberal parties and the New Union Social Liberals (Naujoji SƒÖjunga (socialliberalai), observer LI), member ALDE) is a left of center liberal party. (Main article: Liberalism in Lithuania). * In Luxembourg, the Democratic Party (Demokratesch Partei//Parti D√©mocratique, member LI, ALDE) is the traditional liberal party. (Main article: Liberalism in Luxembourg). * In Malta the largest liberal party is the social-liberal Democratic Party. The party has 2 seats in the parliament and was formed by dissatisfied members of the Labour Party. There are two minor liberal parties: Alleanza Liberal-Demokratika Malta and Alpha Liberal Democratic Party. * In Moldova, liberalism is divided over the conservative-liberal Liberal Party (Partidul Liberal, member ALDE) and the market liberal Liberal Reformist Party (Partidul Liberal Reformator, observer LI), which splintered of the Liberal Party to stay in government and be part of the Pro-European Coalition in 2013. (Main article: Liberalism in Moldova). * In Montenegro, liberalism is organized in the Liberal Party of Montenegro (Liberalna Partija Crne Gore, observer LI, member ALDE), more or less a liberal party. (Main article: Liberalism in Montenegro). * In the Netherlands, liberalism is divided over two parties. The social-liberal Democrats 66 (Democraten 66, member LI, ALDE) and the conservative-liberal People's Party for Freedom and Democracy (Volkspartij voor Vrijheid en Democratie, member LI, ALDE). Furthermore, in 2004 the Green Left started profiling itself as a 'leftist liberal' party, thus possibly breaking with its socialist roots.

Civic Platform is considered economically liberal or conservative-liberal, however, it is conservative in terms of ideology. Created in 2015, liberal Modern (member ALDE) entered parliament in 2015 elections (Main article: Liberalism in Poland). In Poland, there is also conservative and liberal party KORWiN (Liberty), which was established in 2015 by Janusz Korwin-Mikke. It possesses two deputies in the European Parliament and also two MEPs in polish parliament. * In Portugal, liberalism was a strong force in history, namely during the Liberal Revolution of 1820. In contemporary times, the Social Democratic Party was once an Liberal International member, but left the organisation in 1996, and has taken a more conservative orientation since then, joining the European People's Party. However, many observers still see it as a conservative-liberal party. Currently there is small movement called Movimento Liberal Social trying to achieve the status of political party. The Earth Party (former member ALDE, WEP) is a party that advocates both market economy and environmentalism. The most recent party is Iniciativa Liberal that also became a member of the ALDE, in early December 2017. The party was created as an association in 2016, and was approved as a party by the Constitutional Court in 2017. The party was admitted to the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe Party, a European political party, in November 2017. The party ran for election for the first time in the 2019 European Parliament election in Portugal, garnering 0.9% of the votes, and failing to win any seats in the European Parliament.

Yabloko (Yabloko, Russian Democratic Party, Jabloko - Rossijskaja Demokratiƒçeskaja Partija, member LI, ALDE) and the Right Cause (Pravoye Delo, member IDU) are more or less sharing the ideas of liberalism. While Yabloko is social liberal party, the Right Cause can be seen as a democratic conservative market party.

This ended with absolutist and carlist movements and Francoist Spain in the 20th century. At a national level there were attempts to establish half liberal parties, but they did not succeed until Union, Progress and Democracy (Uni√≥n, Progreso y Democracia), a progressive, social liberal and centralist party. It was replaced as major social liberal party in 2015 by Citizens ‚Äì Party of the Citizenry, which is autonomist and postnationalist. The Libertarian Party of Spain is another option as a liberal party it's defends personal rights and economic freedom, with a libertarian point of view. Different points of view between Libertarian Party and other political parties in Spain Libertarian Party of Spain: What we want On a regional level, the Canarian Coalition (Coalici√≥n Canaria) and the Democratic Convergence of Catalonia (Converg√®ncia Democr√°tica de Catalunya, member ALDE) are nationalist, half liberal parties (Main articles: Canovism, Liberalism and radicalism in Spain). * In Sweden, The Liberals (Liberalerna, member LI, ALDE) is a center-right liberal party.

A clear liberal party is the Our Ukraine (Na≈°a Ukrajina), which should be distinguished from the People's Union Our Ukraine. (Main article: Liberalism in Ukraine). * In the Great Britain, liberalism is now represented mainly by the Liberal Democrats (member LI and ALDE), formed in 1988 from a merger of the historical Liberal Party with the Social Democratic Party. The Liberal Party was re-founded in 1989, still exists, has several Councillors in Britain, but at present no parliamentary representation. The Liberal Democrats, which has hundreds of Councillors and 18 Members of Parliament, were the junior party in a governing coalition with the Conservative Party in 2010‚Äì2015. The counterpart of the Liberal Democrats in Northern Ireland is the Alliance Party of Northern Ireland (member LI, ALDE), which was formed in 1970 as a non-ideological cross-community party. (Main article Liberalism in the United Kingdom) =Oceania= Liberalism has a strong tradition in both Australia and New Zealand. * In Australia, the Liberal Party is a party considered to be centre-right. Within the Liberal Party of Australia, there is a fusion of liberal and conservative views, bound by an opposition to socialism. Many would argue that this party is a classical liberal party and that the perception of what liberalism is has changed, not the Liberal Party (which promotes the free market approach that liberals worldwide used to promote before the 20th century). Former Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull, a member of the Liberal Party, has said that his party is \\"not a conservative party\\". The term small-l liberal generally refers to someone who champions civil liberties and progressive causes such as Australian republicanism and reconciliation with Indigenous Australians. These views are represented strongly within the broad Liberal Party, as well as in parties such as the Australian Democrats, which began its life as a group of social-liberals disaffected with the Liberal Party. The Liberal Democratic Party is a classical liberal and libertarian party. (Main article: Australia). * In the Cook Islands the liberal Democratic Party is one of the two major parties opposing the nationalist Cook Islands Party. * In New Zealand, there is no longer a pure liberal party, as in the past the Liberal Party was the first organised political party, and the Liberal Government from 1891 to 1912 was responsible for many reforms. Similarly to Australia, this party merged with more conservative and free market forces to form the National Party of New Zealand, in order to oppose the advancement of the democratic socialist New Zealand Labour Party. Liberalism nowadays refers to a support for individual liberties and limited government. The term is generally used with a reference to a particular policy area, e.g. \\"market liberalism\\" or \\"social liberalism\\". Unqualified liberalism is less common; in its extreme form it is known by the American term libertarianism. The left of centre New Zealand Democratic Party takes a more or less progressive liberal position in the spectrum, but lost popular support. ACT New Zealand is a classical liberal or libertarian party. (Main article: Liberalism in New Zealand). * In the Solomon Islands, the Solomon Islands Liberal Party considers itself a liberal party.

In architecture it is a decorative device, typically carved in stone, employed to emphasize the apex of a dome, spire, tower, roof, or gable or any of various distinctive ornaments at the top, end, or corner of a building or structure. Where there are several such elements they may be called pinnacles. Smaller finials in materials such as metal or wood are used as a decorative ornament on the tops or ends of poles or rods such as tent-poles or curtain rods or any object such as a piece of furniture. These are frequently seen on top of bed posts or clocks. Decorative finials are also commonly used to fasten lampshades, and as an ornamental element at the end of the handles of souvenir spoons. The charm at the end of a pull chain (such as for a ceiling fan or a lamp) is also known as a finial. During the various dynasties in China, a finial was worn on the top of the hats civil or military officials wore during formal court ceremonies. The finial was changed to a knob for other daily usage (including semi-formal ceremonies). The Pickelhaube is a Central European military helmet with a finial topped by a spike. Roof A Balinese kemuncak on top of a thatched roof of a Balinese temple pavilion. In Java and Bali, a rooftop finial is known as mustaka or kemuncak. Flagpoles French Imperial Eagle of a regiment of the Grande Arm√©e A \\"ball-style\\" finial is often mounted to the top of a stationary flagpole. The United States Army, Navy, Marine Corps and Coast Guard employ a variety of different finials depending on the flag in question, the Marines and Coast Guard deferring to the Navy's protocols.Army Regulation 840-10 Flags, Guidons, Streamers, Tabards, and Automobile and Aircraft Plates, Chapter 8 \\"Flagstaffs and Flagstaff Heads (Finials)\\", ¬ß 8-2, 1 November 1998 Bed posts and curtain rods Bed posts and public garden (park) railings often end in finials. Wooden posts tend to have turned wood finials. While the purpose of finials on bed posts is mostly decorative, they serve a purpose on curtain rods, providing a way to keep a curtain from slipping off the end of a straight rod. Curtain rod finials can be seen to act much like a barometer of public taste. Many designs hark back to the Gothic and Neogothic of architectural finials, while other contemporary finials reflect minimalist, art nouveau and other traditional styles of d√©cor. The use of different materials is as wide as the range of designs with brass, stainless steel, various woods and aluminium being employed with a variety of finishes such as ‚Äòsatin steel‚Äô and 'antique brass'. The durability, strength and machinability of modern alloys have lent themselves to increasingly intricate and dazzling designs. Lamps and light fixtures Some lampshades or light fittings, especially in glass, typically terminate in a finial which also serves to affix the shade to the lamp or fixture. Finials are twisted onto the lamp harp. Typically the finial is externally decorative whilst hiding an internal screw thread. There are several standard thread sizes which are used.

The second syllable is accented, with Japanese's unvoiced vowels making it pronounced almost like \\"ski\\" (but preceded by a \\"t\\" sound). In Japanese martial arts and Okinawan martial arts, tsuki is used to refer to various thrusting techniques. Tsuki in Karate Oi-tsuki Gyaku-tsuki In karate and its variants, the term tsuki is used as a part of a compound word for any one of a variety of thrusting techniques (usually punches). It is never used as a stand-alone term to describe a discrete technique. For example, gyaku seiken chudan-tsuki, more commonly referred to as chudan-tsuki (ÊÆµÁ™Å), refers to a mid-level (chudan) punch (tsuki) executed with the rear (gyaku) arm. Note that in a compound word, where tsuki does not come first, its pronunciation and writing changes slightly due to rendaku, and it is pronounced as \\"zuki\\" (and is sometimes transliterated that way). =Performing a Choku-Tsuki (Straight Punch) in Karate= The choku- tsuki (Áõ¥Á™Å„Åç) ‚Äì straight punch‚Äîis a basic karate technique. It is performed by closing the hand in a fist. Target contact is made with the first two knuckles of the fore-fist, with the fist rotated slightly, both externally and downwards, so as to align the wrist directly behind the first two knuckles. For a right choku-tsuki, the right fist is chambered at a preparatory position, at the hips or by the ribs, with the palm side of the fist pointed upwards. At the same time, the left arm is extended in front of the left hip. To perform the choku-tsuki technique, the right fist is thrust forward in a direct path toward the target, with the elbow directly behind the fist and tracing the fist's path. At the same time, the left fist is pulled back to a chambered position at the hip or at the rib cage. The extending fist remains palm up until the last two inches of the punch, during which it rotates to face down. The elbow remains pointed down, since allowing the elbow to rotate to the side or upwards exposes it to injury from either self-inflicted hyperextension, or from a stiff block by the opponent. Ideally, the fist contacts the target in a vertical to a 45 degree rotated position, with the rest of the fist's rotation taking place following initial contact. Karate gives special emphasis to the withdrawing hand ‚Äì hikite (Âºï„ÅçÊâã) ‚Äì which pulls back as the thrusting arm punches. Practitioners are advised to pay as much attention to the pullback action as to the extension of the main punch. Different karate styles will have slightly different pullback chambering positions, varying from as low as on top of the hip, to as high as the armpit. A straight punch executed from a front stance (zenkutsu-dachi) is called gyaku-tsuki (ÈÄÜÁ™Å„Åç, reverse punch) if the advanced leg and fist are on opposite sides, or oi-tsuki (ËøΩ„ÅÑÁ™Å„Åç, forward punch or lunge punch) if the leg and fist are on the same side. =Tsuki Power Generation= The mechanism of power generation in thrusting techniques varies with karate style. Various karate styles and, in particular, Okinawan karate, emphasize the use of the entire body to generate the power that is delivered through the punch. This can include sequencing the activation of muscles, from lower body to upper body, to create a \\"wave\\" of power. In those styles, the body is typically well aligned and relaxed throughout the strike. On the other hand, Japanese karate styles, such as Shotokan, emphasize the movement of the hips as the main mean for generating power: The hips twist as the withdrawing (non-punching) hikite arm is pulled back while the punching arm is pushed forward, and the karateka is taught to tense the whole body and to push down his or her rear leg as the punch makes contact. =Other Examples of Tsuki Techniques= Other examples of basic tsuki techniques in karate include the following: * Age-tsuki (‰∏ä„ÅíÁ™Å„Åç), rising punch * Kagi-tsuki (Èâ§Á™Å„Åç), hook punch * Mawashi-tsuki (Âõû„ÅóÁ™Å„Åç), roundhouse punch * Morote-tsuki (ÂèåÊâãÁ™Å„Åç), augmented punch using both hands * Jun-tsuki (È†ÜÁ™Å„Åç), punch with the lead arm when stationary or moving back/away * Tate- tsuki (Á´ã„Å¶Á™Å„Åç), vertical fist punch into the middle of the chest (short-range) * Ura-tsuki (Ë£èÁ™Å„Åç), upside-down fist punch into solar plexus area (short-range) * Yama-tsuki (Â±±Á™Å„Åç) or Rete-zuki, two-level double punch (combination of ura-zuki and jodan oi zuki) Tsuki in Aikido and Aiki-jo In aikid≈ç, choku-zuki (straight punch, as described above) is a basic thrusting attack from which throwing and pinning skills are taught. However, because in most aikid≈ç schools the straight punch is the predominant punch from which defensive techniques are taught, there is little need to differentiate it from any other punch. Thus, it is shortened and simply called tsuki. In the aiki-j≈ç practiced in some systems of aikido and utilizing a four-foot wooden staff (j≈ç), tsuki is used literally as part of the name of numerous thrusting techniques with the j≈ç. With the student standing in hidari katate-gamae, the weapon is lifted to the right hand, which slides to the bottom end of the weapon. The student shuffle steps forward (suri-ashi) and the right hand pushes the weapon for the strike, allowing it to slide in the left hand, and coming to rest with the left hand gripping the j≈ç one third the distance from the bottom end. Picture striking a billiard ball with a cue stick, except both hands grip the j≈ç with palms down, and thumbs forward. Tsuki in Kendo Tsuki is one of the five target areas (datotsu-bui) in kendo (along with men, do, hidari kote and migi kote).Japanese-English Dictionary of Kendo, All Japan Kendo Federation, Tokyo, Japan. February 1, 2000 It is a thrust of the point of the shinai to the throat. The target area (datotsu-bui) for tsuki is the tsuki-bu, a multi- layered set of flaps, attached to the men (helmet) that protects the throat. Tsuki is most often done with a two handed grip () and less often with only the left hand(). Tsuki is often disallowed for younger and lower graded players in free practice and in competition (shiai). While variants of tsuki exist in other martial arts, in kendo it has no variants‚Äîthe target is always the same. Unlike most other martial arts that use this term, in kendo, tsuki is a comprehensive term for both the movement and the target. Unlike with other strikes in kendo, the kiai for this strike is not the name of the target (the neck, or kubi) but rather the name of the attack (tsuki).

She repeatedly appears in the Rigvedic hymns, states David Kinsley, where she is \\"consistently identified with dawn, revealing herself with the daily coming of light to the world, driving away oppressive darkness, chasing away evil demons, rousing all life, setting all things in motion, sending everyone off to do their duties\\". She is the life of all living creatures, the impeller of action and breath, the foe of chaos and confusion, the auspicious arouser of cosmic and moral order called the ·πöta in Hinduism. Ushas is the most exalted goddess in the Rig Veda, but not as important or central as the three male Vedic deities Agni, Soma and Indra. She is on par with other major male Vedic deities. She is portrayed as a beautifully adorned young woman riding in a golden chariot or a hundred chariots, drawn by golden red horses or cows, on her path across the sky, making way for the Vedic sun god Surya.Kuiper, F.B.J. (1968). Ancient Indian Cosmogony. Bombay 1983. Schmidt, H.P. Brhaspati und Indra. Wiesbaden 1968. Some of the most beautiful hymns in the Vedas are dedicated to her. Her sister is Ratri, or the night.  Etymology  Vedic ' is derived from the word u·π£√° which means \\"dawn\\". This word comes from Proto- Indo-Iranian *Hu≈°ƒÅÃÅs (\\"u≈°ƒÅ\\" in Avestan), which in turn is from Proto-Indo- European *h‚ÇÇ√©us≈çs (\\"dawn\\"), and is related to \\"ƒì·πìs\\" in Greek and \\"au≈°r√†\\" in Lithuanian. It is also the basis for the word \\"east\\" in Indo-European traditions, state Mallory and Adams. U·π£√°s is an s-stem, i.e. the genitive case is ', whereby it connotes \\"dawn goddess\\" in Indo-European languages. Ushas is related to the Proto-Indo-European goddess '. Her cognates in other Indo- European pantheons include the Greek goddess Eos, the Roman goddess Aurora, the Lithuanian goddess Ausrine, and the English goddess ƒíostre (OE: ƒìastre), whose name is probably the root of the modern English word \\"Easter.\\" A non- Indo-European example, but still closely related, is the Japanese goddess Uzume. Description Ushas is the prominent goddess of dawn in the Vedas. She is depicted as the one who imbues life to all beings, as the \\"life of all life\\" and \\"breath of all breaths\\", according to Jones and Ryan. She is revered as the deity who revivifies earth each day, drives away the chaos and the darkness, sets all things in motion, sends all living beings to do their duties in the Vedas. Ushas is the most important goddess in the Vedic literature, but she is not as important as the three central male deities named Agni, Soma and Indra. She is mentioned in far fewer hymns than these three, but nearly equal or more number of hymns than all other male and female deities in the Vedas. = Rig Veda = Ushas is mentioned in numerous hymns of the Rigveda. Forty of its hymns are dedicated to her, while her name appears in other additional hymns. She is thanked for and petitioned for driving away darkness in hymns 7.78, 6.64 and 10.172; bringer of light urged by Surya in hymn 3.61, and the chaser of evil demons in hymn 8.47. The Rigvedic hymn 1.48 describes her as drawn in a hundred chariots, revealed by the daily arrival of light, one who sets all motion to life and all life to motion, rousing people off to their duties. She is revered for giving strength in hymn 1.44, to ·πöta in hymn 3.61 and 7.75, and participating in daily restoration of order and fighting chaotic forces that threaten the world in hymn 1.113. Ushas is described in Vedic texts as riding in a shining chariot drawn by golden-red horses or cows, a beautiful maiden bedecked with jewels, smiling and irresistibly attractive, who brings cheer to all those who gaze upon her. She dispels darkness, reveals treasures and truths that have been hidden, illuminates the world as it is. Hymn 6.64 associates her with wealth and light, while hymn 1.92 calls her the \\"mother of cows\\" and one, who like a cow, gives to the benefit of all people. Hymn 1.113 calls her \\"mother of the gods\\", while hymn 7.81 states her to be the mother of all living beings who petition her. She is the goddess of the hearth, states hymn 6.64. She symbolizes reality, is a marker of time and a reminder to all that \\"life is limited on earth\\". She sees everything as it is, and she is the eye of the gods, according to hymns 7.75‚Äì77. She is variously mentioned as the sister of Ratri (night), Aditya and one who goes about her ways closely with deities Savitri and Surya. She is also associated with Varuna (sky, water) and Agni (fire). In RV 6.64.1-2 (trans. Jamison), Ushas is invoked as follows: Vedic: 1\\\\. √∫d u ≈õriy√° u·π£√°so r√≥camƒÅnƒÅ √°sthur apƒÅÃÅ·πÉ n√≥rm√°yo r√∫≈õanta·∏• krÃ•·πá√≥ti v√≠≈õvƒÅ sup√°thƒÅ sugƒÅÃÅny √°bh≈´d u v√°svƒ´ d√°k·π£i·πáƒÅ magh√≥nƒ´ 2\\\\. bhadrƒÅÃÅ dadrÃ•k·π£a urviyƒÅÃÅ v√≠ bhƒÅsy √∫t te ≈õoc√≠r bhƒÅn√°vo dyƒÅÃÅm apaptan ƒÅv√≠r v√°k·π£a·∏• krÃ•·πáu·π£e ≈õumb ∞√°mƒÅn√≥·π£o devi r√≥camƒÅnƒÅ m√°hobhi·∏• English translation: 1\\\\.

You reveal your breast as you go in beauty, goddess Dawn, shining with all your might. In the \\"family books\\" of the Rig Veda (e.g. RV 6.64.5), Ushas is the divine daughter --a ' --of Dyaus Pita (\\"Sky Father\\"). 5\\\\. Convey (it)‚Äîyou who as the unsurpassable one with your oxen convey the boon at your pleasure, Dawn, you who are a goddess, o Daughter of Heaven. Become worthy to be seen with your munificence at the early invocation!  Contemporary reverence  The revered Gayatri mantra, states George Williams, remains a daily reminder of Ushas in contemporary Hinduism. According to Sri Aurobindo, Ushas is \\"the medium of the awakening, the activity and the growth of the other gods; she is the first condition of the Vedic realisation. By her increasing illumination the whole nature of man is clarified; through her [mankind] arrives at the Truth, through her he enjoys [Truth's] beatitude.\\", p. 283. Ushas is regionally worshipped during the festival of Chhath Puja, in Bihar and Uttar Pradesh (India), and in Nepal. https://www.teachingbanyan.com/essay/long-essay-on- chhath-puja/amp/ See also *Chhaya *ƒíostre *Ratri *Surya *Saranyu *Shani *Ame-no-Uzume References =Bibliography= Category:Hindu goddesses Category:Rigvedic deities Category:Solar goddesses Category:Haus≈çs Category:Hinduism and cattle Category:Dawn ","title":"Ushas"},{"id":"864931","text":"was a town located in ≈åsato District, Saitama Prefecture, Japan.

In this particular context the term 'Insensitiveness' refers to the likelihood of initiation/detonation by accidental means e.g. impact, friction, electrostatic discharge, application of flame, etc. It is a quantitative measure of the level of stimulus required to cause initiation, typically by shock/impact. The Figure of Insensitiveness is determined from impact testing, typically using a drop-weight tower. In this test, a small sample of the explosive is placed on a small steel anvil which is slotted into a recess in the base of the drop tower. A cylindrical, 1 kilogram steel weight (mounted inside a tube to accurately guide its descent to the impact point in the centre of the anvil) is then dropped onto the test specimen from a measured height. The specimen is monitored both during and after this process to determine whether initiation occurs. This test is repeated many times, varying the drop height according to a prescribed method. Various heights are used, starting with a small distance (e.g. 10 cm) and then progressively increasing it to as high as 3 metres. The series of drop heights and whether initiation occurred are analysed statistically to determine the drop height which has a 50% likelihood of initiating the explosives. The intention of these tests is to develop safety policies/rules which will govern the design, manufacturing, handling and storage of the explosive and any munitions containing it. A reference standard sample of RDX is currently used to calibrate the drop tower, so that the drop height to produce 50% likelihood of initiation in this material is measured and recorded. The drop height required to initiate other explosives can then be related to the RDX standard, so that a ready comparison of impact sensitiveness between different explosives can be made. By convention, explosives having a 50% initiation drop height equal to that of RDX are given a F of I of 80. The scale was originally defined using TNT as the reference standard, with TNT having, by definition, an F of I of exactly 100. On this original scale, RDX yielded an F of I of around 80. Following World War II, when more complex explosive compositions replaced pure TNT as the most common energetic component of weapon systems, RDX was adopted as the reference standard. Sensitiveness should not be confused with Sensitivity which is a measure of how easy it is to detonate an explosive, i.e. how sensitive it is to the mode of initiation to achieve a detonation. In this context an explosive which has greater sensitivity, (like specificity) requires a more specific stimulus in order to detonate it.

It holds collections established during the mid-19th century. The Museum's collection was amassed substantially by major American art and sculpture collectors, a father and son: William Thompson Walters, (1819‚Äì1894), who began serious collecting when he moved to Paris as a nominal Southern/Confederate sympathizer at the outbreak of the American Civil War in 1861; and Henry Walters (1848‚Äì1931), who refined the collection and made arrangements for the construction of a later landmark building to rehouse it. After allowing the Baltimore public to occasionally view his father's and his growing added collections at his West Mount Vernon Place townhouse/mansion during the late 1800s, he arranged for an elaborate stone palazzo-styled structure built for that purpose in 1905‚Äì1909. Located across the back alley, a block south of the Walters mansion on West Monument Street/Mount Vernon Place, on the northwest corner of North Charles Street at West Centre Street. The mansion and gallery were also just south and west of the landmark Washington Monument in the Mount Vernon-Belvedere neighborhood, just north of the downtown business district and northeast of Cathedral Hill. Upon his 1931 death, Henry Walters bequeathed the entire collection of then more than 22,000 works, the original Charles Street Gallery building, and his adjacent townhouse/mansion just across the alley to the north on West Mount Vernon Place to the City of Baltimore, \\"for the benefit of the public.\\" The collection includes masterworks of ancient Egypt, Greek sculpture and Roman sarcophagi, medieval ivories, illuminated manuscripts, Renaissance bronzes, Old Master European and 19th-century paintings, Chinese ceramics and bronzes, Art Deco jewelry, and ancient Near East, Mesopotamian, or ancient Middle East items. In 2000, \\"The Walters Art Gallery\\" changed its long-time name to \\"The Walters Art Museum\\" to reflect its image as a large public institution and eliminate confusion among some of the increasing out-of-state visitors. The following year, \\"The Walters\\" (as it is often known in the city) reopened its original main building after a dramatic three-year physical renovation and replacement of internal utilities and infrastructure. The Archimedes Palimpsest was on loan to the Walters Art Museum from a private collector for conservation and spectral imaging studies. Starting on October 1, 2006, the museum was enabled to make admission free to all, year-round, as a result of substantial grants given by Baltimore City and the surrounding suburban Baltimore County arts agencies and authorities. In 2012, \\"The Walters\\" released nearly 20,000 of its own images of its collections on a Creative Commons license, and collaborated in their upload to the world-wide web and the internet on Wikimedia Commons. This was one of the largest and most comprehensive such releases made by any museum. Permanent collection =Ancient art= The Walters' collection of ancient art includes examples from Egypt, Nubia, Greece, Rome, Etruria and the Near East. Highlights include two monumental 3,000-pound statues of the Egyptian lion- headed fire goddess Sekhmet; the Walters Mummy; alabaster reliefs from the palace of Ashurnasirpal II; Greek gold jewelry, including the Greek bracelets from Olbia on the shores of the Black Sea; the Praxitelean Satyr; a large assemblage of Roman portrait heads; a Roman bronze banquet couch, and marble sarcophagi from the tombs of the prominent Licinian and Calpurnian families.

This forms the basis of the Walters' medieval collection, for which the museum is best known internationally. Considered one of the best collections of medieval art in the United States, the museum's holdings include examples of metalwork, sculpture, stained glass, textiles, icons, and other paintings. The collection is especially renowned for its ivories, enamels, reliquaries, early Byzantine silver, post-Byzantine art, illuminated manuscripts, and the largest and finest collection of Ethiopian Orthodox Church art outside Ethiopia. The Walters' medieval collection features unique objects such as the Byzantine agate Rubens Vase that belonged to the painter Rubens (accession no. 42.562) and the earliest-surviving image of the \\"Virgin of Tenderness\\", an ivory carving produced in Egypt in the 6th or 7th century (accession no. 71.297). Sculpted heads from the royal Abbey of St. Denis are rare surviving examples of portal sculptures that are directly connected with the origins of Gothic art in 12th-century France (accession nos. 27.21 and 27.22). An ivory casket covered with scenes of jousting knights is one of about a dozen such objects to survive in the world (accession no. 71.264). Many of these works are on display in the museum's galleries. Works from the medieval collection are also frequently included in special touring exhibitions, such as Treasures of Heaven, an exhibition about relics and reliquaries that was on view at the Cleveland Museum of Art in (Cleveland, Ohio), the Walters Art Museum, and the British Museum in London in 2010‚Äì11. Works in the medieval collection are the subject of active research by the curatorial and conservation departments of the museum, and visiting researchers frequently make use of the museum's holdings. In-depth technical research carried on these objects is made available to the public through publications and exhibitions, as in the case of the Amandus Shrine (accession no. 53.9), which was featured in a small special exhibition titled The Special Dead in 2008‚Äì09.

Highlights of the collection include Odalisque with Slave by Ingres (a second version); Claude Monet's Springtime; Alfred Sisley's panoramic view of the Seine Valley; and √âdouard Manet's realist masterpiece, The Caf√© Concert. Henry Walters was particularly interested in the courtly arts of 18th-century France. The museum's collection of S√®vres porcelain includes a number of pieces that were made for members of the Royal Bourbon Court at Versailles Palace outside of Paris. Portrait miniatures and the examples of goldsmiths' works, especially snuffboxes and watches, are displayed in the Treasury, along with some exceptional 19th- and early-20th-century works. Among them are examples of Art Nouveau-styled jewelry by Ren√© Lalique, jeweled objects by the House of Faberg√©, including two Russian Imperial Easter eggs, and precious jewels by Tiffany and Co. of New York City. The Walters' collection presents an overview of 19th-century European art, particularly art from France. From the first half of the century come major paintings by Ingres, G√©ricault, and Delacroix. William Walters stayed in Paris with his family during the Civil War, because of his notorious Southern-leanings, and he soon developed a keen interest in contemporary European painting. He either commissioned directly from the artists or purchased at auctions such major works by the Barbizon masters, including Jean-Fran√ßois Millet and Henri Rousseau; the academic masters Jean- L√©on G√©r√¥me and Lawrence Alma-Tadema; and even the modernists Monet, Manet, and Sisley, the Italian Antonio Rotta.

Its exterior was inspired by the Renaissance-revival-style H√¥tel Pourtal√®s in Paris and its interior was modeled after the 17th-century \\"Collegio dei Gesuiti\\" (now the Palazzo dell'Universit√†) built by the Balbi family for the Jesuits in Genoa.

Atemi can be delivered by any part of the body to any part of the opponent's body. They can be percussive or use \\"soft\\" power. Karate is a typical martial art focusing on percussive atemi. The location of nerve and pressure points, such as might be used for certain acupressure methods, also often informs the choice of targets for atemi (see kyusho). Some strikes against vital parts of the body can kill or incapacitate the opponent: on the solar plexus, at the temple, under the nose, in the eyes, genitals, or under the chin. Traditional Japanese martial arts (the ancestors of judo, jujutsu, and aikido) do not commonly practice atemi, since they were supposed to be used on the battlefield against armoured opponents. However, there are certain exceptions. Atemi can be complete techniques in and of themselves, but are also often used to briefly break an opponent's balance (see kuzushi) or resolve. This is the predominant usage of atemi in aikido.The Use of Striking in Aikido A painful but non-fatal blow to an area such as the eyes, face, or some vulnerable part of the abdomen can open the way for a more damaging technique, such as a throw or joint lock. Even if the blow does not land, the opponent can be distracted, and may instinctively contort their body (e.g., jerking their head back from a face strike) in such a way that they lose their balance. The development of atemi techniques arises from the evolution of the Japanese martial arts, in particular jujutsu. Early styles of jujutsu from Sengoku-era Japan were created as a means of unarmed combat for a samurai who had lost his weapons on the battlefield. The purpose of jujutsu was to disarm the opponent and use their own weapon against them. As such, strikes to the body were limited as the intended victim would have been wearing extensive body armour. However, in later styles of jujutsu from Edo-period Japan empty-handed strikes to the body became more common as full-scale military engagement began to decline. This meant that the jujutsu practitioner's opponent would not have been wearing armour and the vital points that form the crux of atemi-waza were more exposed. Atemi waza in original judo Kodokan judo as designed by Jigoro Kano also contained atemi waza (ÂΩì„Å¶Ë∫´ÊäÄ) or body-striking techniques from the several jujitsu styles that inspired Kano, which however were excluded from its sports competition repertoire which limits itself to throws (nage waza) and holds (kansetsu waza): although taught within self defense, kata and sometimes used within informal randori, striking techniques are forbidden in the sport judo competitions rules.'Kodokan Judo Atemi Waza - Study of the official classification of Atemi Waza and Kyusho by Jigoro Kano by Jos√© A.

The chronicles tell of a \\"great battle,\\" in which Alexander's men stormed and sank three Swedish ships, and Alexander himself wounded Birger, the Swedish commander. Following this victory on the Neva, the prince was renamed Alexander Nevsky. The Russian Orthodox Church eventually canonized him, and he is now the patron saint of Saint Petersburg. A church was built on the bank of the Neva in 1799 to commemorate the famous battle. Close by the church are two monuments honoring Alexander Nevsky, in whose memory the church is dedicated.

It is the largest single-subdome mosque in Bosnia and Herzegovina, built in the classical Ottoman style of the era. It was built by one Isakoviƒá-Hranu≈°iƒá who dedicated it to the Sultan, Mehmed the Conqueror, the conqueror of Constantinople. Considered one of the most beautiful mosques of the Ottoman period in the Balkans, the mosque features a roomy interior and high quality decorative details, such as the mihrab. History The original mosque was built in the mid-fifteenth century. Damaged and totally destroyed at the end of that century, it was rebuilt in 1565 and dedicated this time to Suleyman the Magnificent. The first mosque was made of wood and significantly smaller than existing building that was built in 1565. Side rooms were added in 1800 and connected to the central prayer area in 1848. Between 1980 and 1983 the painted decorations in the interior of the mosque were conserved and restored. The burial ground (graveyard) beside the Emperor's Mosque contains the graves of viziers, mullahs, muftis, sheikhs, the employees in the Emperor's Mosque, along with other prominent figures living in Sarajevo. The mosque was damaged during World War II but mostly in the wars during the 1990s, and renovation work is pending. The first settlements in Sarajevo were built around the mosque with the residence of the Sultan's representatives then being built next to the mosque. Isa-bey also built a hammam (public bath) and a bridge that led directly to the mosque. This bridge was disassembled during the Austro-Hungarian government and rebuilt just a few meters upstream where it still exists today. On the other side of the river, he built a caravanserai. For the financing of these facilities, Isa-bey left a heritage of many shops, land and properties.

He writes under the pen name Lao Khamhom (, ). He was named a National Artist in Literature in 1992http://art.culture.go.th/index.php?case=artistDetail&pic;_id=374&art;_id=46 and is best known for his satirical short stories published in his 1958 collection Fa Bo Kan (, ) ['The Sky is No Barrier']. Benedict Anderson argues that Khamsing is the best known short story writer in Thailand.Anderson, Benedict R.O'G and Ruchira Mendiones editors, In The Mirror: Literature and Politics In Siam in the American Era, (Bangkok: Editions Duang Kamol, 1985), 291. Early life Born 25 December 1930 in Bua Yai District of Thailand's northeastern Nakhon Ratchasima Province,Anderson, 291. Khamsing was raised on a farm in the countryside. Khamsing read heavily during his childhood and was encouraged in his studies by his uncle, a Buddhist monk, and other members of his family.Khamsin Srinawk, The Politician and Other Stories, edited by Domnern Garden and Herbert P. Phillips, introduction by Herbert P. Phillips, (Chiang Mai: Silkworm Press, 2000), viii. He was the sixth of seven children by his parents Suay and Kham Srinawk.Martin Platt, \\"Khamsing Srinawk (Lao Khamhom)\\" in Dictionary of Literary Biography, Vol. 348: Southeast Asian Writers (New York: Gale Cengage Learning, 2009) After completing schooling in the local Bua Yai government school, he traveled to Bangkok and simultaneously enrolled in the faculty of journalism at Chulalongkorn University and the faculty of economics at Thammasat University.Anderson, 291. Unable to afford room and board, Khamsing lived in a Buddhist temple in Bangkok while attending night classes and working part time as a journalist until he was overcome with illness and forced to drop out of school.Anderson, 291., Khamsin, viii. As a journalist, he served as a political reporter and feature writer.Nitaya Masavisut, ed. Thai P.E.N. Anthology: Short Stories and Poems of Social Consciousness (Bangkok: P.E.N. International-Thailand Center, 1984) p. 113 He saw journalism as a way to improve society.Platt The first paper he worked for was Naew Na.Homkham...Lao Khamhom: Retrospective on the fifth printing of Fa Bo Kan and its influence on Thai literature, Arts, Humanities, Social Sciences at Maha Sarakham University, December 14‚Äì15, 1994, p. 6 [in Thai] Newspapers were Khamsing's entry to the literary world of Bangkok and he would use these connections to begin publishing his work. His personal farm in Pak Chong District, Nakhon Ratchasima, became a refuge in times of crisis or government suppression of intellectuals, especially in the late-1950s and on his return from exile in the early-1980s. The farm produced corn, cotton, and milk using \\"modern\\" methods.Phillips, \\"Introduction\\" p. ix. It also may have added a mystique to Khamsing's persona as one who could shift between rural and urban contexts seamlessly. More importantly, his farm in later years became a place for young writers to come to learn the craft.Platt, p. 106, 108. From Bangkok, Khamsing took a job with the state forestry service, working in the far north as a forest ranger for three years (1953‚Äì1956). Herbert Phillips, who knew Khamsing, said that it was a time when the author \\"thrived ‚Äì psychologically, physically, and as a reader and writer.\\"Phillips, \\"Introduction,\\" p. ix On his return to Bangkok, he worked for a Cornell anthropology research project with Phillips and others. He took odd jobs as a traveling sewing machine salesman. He even briefly opened his own publishing house named Kwian Thong ('Golden Oxcart').Homkham, p. 6 Publication of Fa Bo Kan A year after his stint in the forestry service, Khamsing began publishing short stories in the newspaper Piyamit () ['Dear Friend']. Other publications where his work appeared include: Chiwit, Sangkhommasat Parithat, Khwan Chai and Chatturat. More extensive publication history can be found in the 1979 Thai edition of his Fa Bo Kan. This corresponded with the relatively free press Thailand enjoyed during the years 1955‚Äì1958. Due to the political power-struggle between CIA- backed Phao Sriyanond and Pentagon-supported Sarit Thanarat, Thai writers and intellectuals were free to express their ideas. This atmosphere of free press quickly evaporated after the 16 September 1957 coup that drove Phao and Plaek Pibulsonggram into exile.Anderson, 18 Anderson argues that Khamsing's Fa Bo Kan, a collection of many of his stories originally published in Piyamit, best symbolizes this period of intellectual freedom.Anderson, 19 Shortly after the publication of Fa Bo Kan, Sarit seized power and established an absolute regime. Sarit's regime reinstated strict censorship, ending the period of free thought through imprisonment, exile, and execution of Thai intellectuals, writers, and progressives.Anderson, 19 This crackdown on progressives and the independent press forced Khamsing to abandon writing for a number of years, during which time he returned to Nakhon Ratchasima to his farm. Travels abroad and return In 1967‚Äì1968 Khamsing was awarded a Time-Life grant to visit the US.Anderson, p. 291 He spent the year working with the publishing house. On his way back to Thailand he visited France, Germany, Israel, and the Ivory Coast, apparently as an official guest studying literary and agricultural activities.Nitaya, p. 114 He was able to lecture at several universities on his work and contemporary Thai literature.Phillips, \\"Introduction,\\" p. ix After his return to Thailand, Suchat Sawatsi invited him to contribute regularly to Sangkhommasat Parithat () ['Social Science Review']. These articles, many of which were concerned with social injustice in rural Thailand, were compiled in a 1975 publication known as Kamphaeng (, ) ['Walls'].Anderson, 291 Suchat, along with Sulak Sivaraksa rediscovered the work of Khamsing after a visit to his farm, which led to the republication of Fa Bo Kan and his writing was disseminated in magazines of university literary clubs.Platt, p. 105 In 1970 Khamsing was married to Prawee. They would subsequently have three daughters together.Platt, p. 105 Political action and exile Khamsing continued writing and working on his farm in Nakhon Ratchasima until the beginning of the 1973 student democracy movement. After the military and police crackdown on student demonstrations at Thammasat University on 14 October 1973, Khamsing became politically active and was elected vice-chairman of the Socialist Party of Thailand.Anderson, 291 It is said that on two occasions in the early-1970s, Khamsing sold off many of his milking cows to finance unsuccessful campaigns for election to Thai parliament.Khamsing, ix In 1975 a Committee for the Revision of Textbooks in the Ministry of Education sought to revise the school curriculum to emphasize the role of average people in society. As a result, on 17 May a new reading list for Mathayom Suksa 4 and 5 was published in Sayam Rat which made the work of Khamsing, along with fifteen others, part of the mandatory reading.Mattani Mojdara Rutnin, Modern Thai Literature (Bangkok: Thammasat University Press, 1988) p. 61. After the Thammasat University massacre of 6 October 1976, Khamsing fled with many others to the jungle, eventually making his way to Laos. His work was banned by the incoming government.Platt, p. 105 Several months later, in 1977 he went into exile with his family to Sweden after a disagreement with the Communist Party of Thailand.Anderson, 291 In Sweden he was made a member of the Swedish Association of Writers and was able to promote his work in Europe.Homkham, p. 6 While in exile, he went on a lecture tour in the US.Platt, p. 106 He also began again working on his first novel Maeo (, ) ['Cat'], which is a metaphor for Thailand itself.Khamsing, ix Khamsing first began working on Maeo after the events of 14 October 1973, but he manuscript was lost in the turmoil of 1976. Eventually, the novel was published in 1983 after Khamsing returned to Bangkok in 1981. Influence on Thai literature Even though he is not a prolific author, Khamsing is credited with starting a shift in Thai literary style and focus. While the majority of Thai literature before the 20th century was dominated by royal and elite authors writing for the kingdom's gentry, Khamsing's divergence from typical Thai literary subject matter created the concept of the Thai peasant as hero.Khamsing, vii By giving voice to the common peasant, often in the vernacular in the village setting, Khamsing's writings, most notably Fa Bo Kan, worked to democratize Thai literature. In his works, Khamsing has depicted the plight of the Thai peasant, and in so doing, seek social justice and the betterment of Thai society in general. His writing is seen as a preeminent example of the \\"life as art\\" movement advocated by Jit Phumisak. His work has been listed as among the best in a century of the Thai short story.Platt, p. 106 In 1992 the National Cultural Commission, with royal support, awarded him the title \\"National Artist of Thailand in Literature,\\" including a stipend for life.Phillips, \\"Introduction,\\" p.ix. His work is now featured in the national school curriculum.Platt, p. 105 His work has been translated into nine languages, including English, Swedish, Danish, Dutch, Japanese, Singhalese, Malay, German, and French. His English translators have included Michael Smythes, Herbert Phillips, and Domnern Garden. In May 2011, Khamsing added his name to what has come to be called the \\"Thai Writers' Manifesto\\", a petition signed by 359 Thai writers and academics calling for drastic revisions to Thailand's l√®se majest√© laws (Article 112 of current Thai Criminal Code), under which numerous Thai and others have been jailed.http://www.thaipoetsociety.com/index.php?topic=3842.0;wap2 References Category:1930 births Khamsing Srinawk Khamsing Srinawk Khamsing Srinawk Category:Living people Category:Chulalongkorn University alumni Category:People from Nakhon Ratchasima Province ","title":"Khamsing Srinawk"},{"id":"865000","text":"Lake Ono and Akagi shrine in Mount Akagi was a village located in Seta District, Gunma Prefecture, Japan.

It served as the British military headquarters on India's west coast until 1887. In conjunction with her sister city, Tellicherry, it was the third-largest city on the western coast of British India in the 18th century after Bombay and Karachi. St. Angelo Fort was built in 1505 by Dom Francisco de Almeida, the first Portuguese Viceroy of India. The Dutch captured the fort from the Portuguese in 1663. They modernised the fort and built the bastions Hollandia, Zeelandia, and Frieslandia that are the major features of the present structure. The original Portuguese fort was pulled down later. A painting of this fort and the fishing ferry behind it can be seen in the Rijksmuseum Amsterdam. The Dutch sold the fort to the king Ali Raja of Arakkal in 1772. The British conquered it in 1790 and used it as one of their major military stations on the Malabar Coast.

It is indigenous to Armenia.\\"‚Ä¶which is indigenous to Armenia,‚Ä¶\\" , World Music: Africa, Europe and the Middle East p.335 Variations of the Armenian duduk are found in other regions of the Caucasus and the Middle East, including Azerbaijan, Georgia, Russia, Turkey, and Iran. It is commonly played in pairs: while the first player plays the melody, the second plays a steady drone called dum, and the sound of the two instruments together creates a richer, more haunting sound. The unflattened reed and cylindrical body produce a sound closer to the English horn than to more commonly known double reeds. Unlike other double reed instruments like the oboe or shawm, the duduk has a very large reed proportional to its size. UNESCO proclaimed the Armenian duduk and its music as a Masterpiece of the Intangible Heritage of Humanity in 2005 and inscribed it in 2008. Duduk music has been used in a number of films, most notably in The Russia House and Gladiator. Etymology The word d√ºd√ºk is of Turkish origin (Ottoman Turkish: ÿØŸàÿØŸàŸÉ‚Äé d√ºd√ºk),D√ºd√ºk in Ni≈üanyan S√∂zl√ºk itself derived from Persian tutak. In Armenia, the instrument is also known as tsiranapogh (’Æ’´÷Ä’°’∂’°÷É’∏’≤). This instrument is not to be confused with the northwestern Bulgarian folk instrument of the same name (see below, Balkan duduk). Similar instruments used in other parts of Western Asia are the mey and balaban. Overview 80px A duduk mouthpiece The duduk is a double reed instrument with ancient origins, having existed since at least the fifth century, while there are Armenian scholars who believe it existed more than 1,500 years before that. The earliest instruments similar to the duduk's present form are made of bone or entirely of cane. Today, the duduk is exclusively made of wood with a large double reed, with the body made from aged apricot wood. The particular tuning depends heavily on the region in which it is played. In the twentieth century, the Armenian duduk began to be standardized diatonic in scale and single-octave in range. Accidentals, or chromatics are achieved using fingering techniques. The instrument's body also has different lengths depending upon the range of the instrument and region. The reed (Armenian: ’•’≤’•’£’∂, eƒ°egn), is made from one or two pieces of cane in a duck-bill type assembly. Unlike other double-reed instruments, the reed is quite wide, helping to give the duduk both its unique, mournful sound, as well as its remarkable breath requirements. The duduk player is called dudukahar (’§’∏÷Ç’§’∏÷Ç’Ø’°’∞’°÷Ä) in Armenian. The performer uses air stored in their cheeks to keep playing the instrument while they inhale air into their lungs. This \\"circular\\" breathing technique is commonly used with all the double-reed instruments in the Middle East. Duduk \\"is invariably played with the accompaniment of a second dum duduk, which gives the music an energy and tonic atmosphere, changing the scale harmoniously with the principal duduk.\\" Duduk Info at Ethnicinstruments.co.uk History Armenian musicologists cite evidence of the duduk's use as early as 1200 BC, though Western scholars suggest it is 1,500 years old.Encyclopedia.com:DJIVAN GASPARYAN Variants of the duduk can be found in Armenia and the Caucasus. The history of the Armenian duduk music is dated to the reign of the Armenian king Tigran the Great, who reigned from 95‚Äì55 B.C.\\"The roots of Armenian duduk music go back to the times of the Armenian king Tigran the Great (95-55 BC)\\": \\"The Duduk and its Music . UNESCO. Accessed February 8, 2010. According to ethnomusicologist Dr. Jonathan McCollum, the instrument is depicted in numerous Armenian manuscripts of the Middle Ages, and is \\"actually the only truly Armenian instrument that's survived through history, and as such is a symbol of Armenian national identity ... The most important quality of the duduk is its ability to express the language dialectic and mood of the Armenian language, which is often the most challenging quality to a duduk player.\\" Balkan duduk While \\"duduk\\" most commonly refers to the double reed instrument described on this page, by coincidence there is a different instrument of the same name played in northwestern Bulgaria. This is a blocked-end flute resembling the Serbian frula, known also as kaval or kavalƒçe in a part of Macedonia,www.macedoniadirect.com/instruments/supelki.htm and as duduk (–¥—É–¥—É–∫) in northwest Bulgaria.For a detailed description of the instrument (in Bulgarian), see Made of maple or other wood, it comes in two sizes: and (duduce). The blocked end is flat. Playing this type of duduk is fairly straightforward and easy, and its sound is clean and pleasant. In popular culture The sound of the duduk has become known to wider audiences through its use in popular film soundtracks. Starting with Peter Gabriel's score for Martin Scorsese's The Last Temptation of Christ, the duduk's archaic and mournful sound has been employed in a variety of genres to depict such moods. Djivan Gasparyan played the duduk in Gladiator, Syriana, and Blood Diamond, among others. It was also used extensively in Battlestar Galactica. In the TV series Avatar: The Last Airbender, its computer-altered sound was given to the fictitious Tsungi horn, most notably played by Iroh and often being featured in the show's soundtrack. The sound of the duduk was used in The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe for a lullaby which Mr. Tumnus plays on a fictitious double flute.Harry Gregson-Williams Talks Narnia & Narnian Lullaby Clip It was also used in the theme song of the Dothraki clan in the TV adaptation Game of Thrones.No flutes allowed: Composer Ramin Djawadi on the music of 'Game of Thrones' , Deutsche Welle The 2010 Eurovision Song Contest entry from Armenia \\"Apricot Stone\\", which finished 7th in the final, featured prominent duduk played by Djivan Gasparyan. =Film soundtracks= The duduk has been used in a number of films, especially \\"to denote otherworldliness, loneliness, and mourning or to supply a Middle Eastern/Central Asian atmosphere\\". * Ararat (2002) by Mychael Danna * Avatar (2009) by James Horner, in the track Shutting Down Grace's Lab * Bedtime Stories (2008) by Rupert Gregson-Williams * Brotherhood of the Wolf (2001) by Joseph LoDuca * Chilean Gothic (2000) by Fractal * Constantine (2005) by Brian Tyler, Klaus Badelt, in the track Circle of Hell * The Crow (1994) by Graeme Revell featuring the duduk player Djivan Gasparyan * Dead Man Walking (1995) by David Robbins * Elektra (2005) by Christophe Beck * Gladiator (2000) by Djivan Gasparyan in the track Duduk of the North * Hotel Rwanda (2004) main theme music\\"Hotel Rwanda Film Music\\" * Hulk (2003) duduk by Pedro Eustache by Danny Elfman * The Island (2005) by Steve Jablonsky * The Kite Runner (2007) by Alberto Iglesias * The Last Temptation of Christ (1988) by Peter Gabriel, featuring the duduk player Vatche Hovsepian * The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe (2005) by Harry Gregson-Williams, in the track A Narnia Lullaby * Munich duduk by Pedro Eustache (2005) by John Williams * Mayrig (1991) by Omar Al Sharif * Next (2007) by Mark Isham * The Passion of The Christ (2004) by Mel Gibson, composer John Debney duduks by Pedro Eustache and Chris Bleth * Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End (2007) by Hans Zimmer * Rendition (2007) by Paul Hepker and Mark Kilian, duduk by Pedro Eustache * Ronin (1998) by Elia Cmiral, duduk by Albert Vardanyan * Syriana (2005) by Alexandre Desplat, duduks by Djivan Gasparyan and Pedro Eustache * The Russia House (1990) by Jerry Goldsmith * The Siege (1998) by Graeme Revell, in the track Torture * Vantage Point (2008) by Atli Orvarsson * Wanted (2008) by Danny Elfman * Warriors of Heaven and Earth (2003) by A.

Hot water crust is traditionally used for producing hand-made pies. As the name suggests, the pastry is made by heating water, melting the fat in it, bringing the mixture to a boil, and finally incorporating the flour. This can be done by beating the flour into the mixture in the pan, or by kneading on a pastry board. Either way, the result is a hot and rather sticky paste that can be used for hand-raising: shaping by hand, sometimes using a dish or bowl as an inner mould. The molded crust retains its shape as it cools, and is prepared for baking with a filling and additional layer of pastry crust on top. Hand-raised hot water crust pastry does not produce a neat and uniform finish, as there will be sagging during the cooking of the filled pie. This is generally accepted as the mark of a hand-made pie. It is possible, however, to bake the pastry in a mould, as with other pies. The pastry is often used to make pork pies, and the pastry allows a wet filling to be held in.

Her search ended in sadness, when she discovered her boyfriend had been murdered by a gang during a bar brawl.

In 1874, they moved to Prescott, Arizona. George Monroe had discovered a water spring there. He turned it into a resort and named it \\"Monroe Springs\\". The attraction drove many tourists from around the country. Mollie Monroe was also a gambler. Apart from her alcoholism, her gambling addiction also led her to lose a considerable amount of money, once selling a gold mine she had discovered for around $2,500 dollars, then gambling the money away in about a week. Despite her addictions, Monroe enjoyed helping needy people, such as prostitutes, lone women and their children. Legend has it that once she met a woman and her children; having been told by the woman that her husband went to town for supplies three days before and had not returned, she went searching for the man, and found him in a bar. She then led him out of the bar, tied him to her horse and dragged him all the way back to his house, staying overnight to make sure he wouldn't leave the house again. A newspaper report also told of her saving the lives of 20 army men when attacked by Apaches. According to the article, she had left the men to look for items to cook with, and when she returned, she noticed that the army men were surrounded by Apache, and that two army men had already been killed. She and her friend, Texas Johnson, fired shots into the air, and the Apaches ran, according to the news. Mollie Monroe was despised by most of Prescott's high society women, for what they viewed as \\"manly manners\\" and, as a popular publication of the time said, \\"morals that are dissolute\\". In 1877, she was found wandering across the streets of Peeples Valley by a policeman named Ed Bowers. Brought to trial, she was found to be insane on May 9 and sent to a sanitarium in Stockton, California. Along the way to Stockton, she and Bowers were attacked by thieves. Other than Bowers losing a watch and some 450 dollars, the lawman and Monroe came out unscathed from the attack. Mollie Monroe's times at the California asylum did not go without controversy: she tried burning the building once, causing her to be sent to San Quentin jail. Once there, she forged a friendship with former Arizona governor A.P.K. Safford (after whom the city of Safford, Arizona is named). Many viewed this as an attempt by Mollie to get out of San Quentin. In 1887, she was sent to a new asylum built in Phoenix. In 1895, she escaped the asylum, and was found four days later. With only a few crackers and a bottle of water taken to support herself, she was found bleeding and in bad overall health. Her health, troubled by her alcohol problems, continued to decline, and in 1902, she died in the Phoenix asylum.

For other meanings of activism, see Activism. The Nationalist activism was an elitist political movement of the early 20th century in Scandinavia, Finland and the Baltic countries. The Activists advocated in brief a close cooperation with Imperial Germany, and active support of Germany's military aims -- primarily directed against Imperial Russia, Bolshevist Russia and the Soviet Union. The activism was revived in both Finland and Sweden in connection with the Winter War. This activism was ideologically related, although distantly, to the thoughts that would result in Fascism in Italy. Activists were often ardent anti-Socialists and deeply suspicious of democracy and parliamentarism. In Scandinavia, activist policies were judged unsuccessful when occasionally (half-ways) implemented, as in the years before the dissolution of the union between Sweden and Norway and in Sweden in the first two years of World War I; but in Finland the Activism was seen as successful in establishing the White Guard, the German-trained J√§gers, the victory in the Finnish Civil War, and the thereby secured independence. While in Finland the activism would continue in movements of the interbellum: the Academic Karelia Society, the Lapua movement and the Patriotic People's Movement; in the Baltic countries and Sweden it hardly survived outside some narrow circles of military officers, industrialists and aristocrats with political ambitions.

Some were underground chambers, usually man-made, close to natural sources of winter ice such as freshwater lakes, but many were buildings with various types of insulation. During the winter, ice and snow would be cut from lakes or rivers, taken into the ice house, and packed with insulation (often straw or sawdust). It would remain frozen for many months, often until the following winter, and could be used as a source of ice during the summer months. The main application of the ice was the storage of foods, but it could also be used simply to cool drinks, or in the preparation of ice-cream and sorbet desserts. During the heyday of the ice trade, a typical commercial ice house would store of ice in a and building. History A cuneiform tablet from c. 1780 BC records the construction of an icehouse by Zimri-Lim, the King of Mari, in the northern Mesopotamian town of Terqa, \\"which never before had any king built.\\" In China, archaeologists have found remains of ice pits from the 7th century BC, and references suggest that these were in use before 1100 BC. Alexander the Great stored snow in pits dug for that purpose around 300 BC. In Rome, in the 3rd century AD, snow was imported from the mountains, stored in straw-covered pits, and sold from snow shops. The ice that formed in the bottom of the pits sold at a higher price than the snow on top.  In the United Kingdom  The ice house entrance, Eglinton Country Park, Scotland The ice house was introduced to Britain around 1660. Various types and designs of ice house exist but British ice houses were commonly brick-lined, domed structures, with most of their volume underground. Ice houses varied in design depending on the date and builder, but were usually conical or rounded at the bottom to hold melted ice. They usually had a drain to take away the melt- water. It is recorded that the idea for ice houses was brought to Britain by travellers who had seen similar arrangements in Italy, where peasants collected ice from the mountains and used it to keep food fresh inside caves. Ice houses were also known as ice wells, ice pits or ice mounds. Game larders and venison larders were sometimes marked on Ordnance Survey maps as ice houses. Bruce Walker, an expert on Scottish Vernacular buildings, has suggested that relatively numerous and usually long-ruined ice houses on country estates have led to Scotland's many legends of secret tunnels. Ice was often imported into the UK from Scandinavia until the 1920s, although from around 1900 the import of ice declined sharply owing to the development of factories in the UK where ice was made artificially. Usually, only large mansions had purpose-built buildings to store ice. Many examples of ice houses exist in the UK, some of which have fallen into disrepair. Good examples of 19th-century ice houses can be found at Ashton Court, Bristol, Albrighton, Bridgnorth, Grendon, Warwickshire, and at Christchurch Mansion, Ipswich, Suffolk, Petworth House, Sussex, Danny House, Sussex, Ayscoughfee Hall, Spalding, Rufford Abbey, Eglinton Country Park in Scotland, Parlington Hall in Yorkshire and Croxteth Hall Liverpool, Burghley House, Stamford and Moggerhanger Park, Moggerhanger, Bedfordshire. An unusual example of an ice house that was converted from a redundant brick springhead can be found in the former grounds of Norton House, Midsomer Norton, Somerset. The largest surviving ice house in the UK is the Tugnet Ice House in Spey Bay. It was built in 1830, and used to store ice for packing salmon caught in the River Spey before transportation to market in London. The ice house at Moggerhanger Park, Moggerhanger, Bedfordshire In 2018, the very large Park Crescent West ice well was discovered in Park Crescent, London. It was created for Samuel Dash in the early 1780s for commercial use before the building of the John Nash crescent was begun in 1806. This ice house is deep, and wide, and is only a few metres away from the Jubilee line on the London Underground. Originally used for the storage of local ice taken from the River Thames in the winter months, it was taken over in the 1820s by the ice merchant William Leftwich, who used it for storing imported ice from the frozen lakes of Norway. A pair of commercial ice wells has been preserved in London, beneath what is now the London Canal Museum at King's Cross. They are around 30 feet in diameter and were originally 42 feet deep. They were built in 1857 and 1863 by the Swiss entrepreneur Carlo Gatti.  In the Republic of Ireland  In 1985, a passage was discovered beneath Ardgillan Castle in Co. Dublin, Republic of Ireland. This passage was found to be the ice house that had been known to exist on the grounds, but whose location had not been rediscovered until this date.  In the United States  A c. 1930 commercial icehouse near Ambler's Texaco Station in Dwight, Illinois, United States Former icehouse in Coney Island, Brooklyn, New York City Ice houses allowed a trade in ice that was a major part of the early economy of the New England region of the United States, which saw fortunes made by people who transported ice in straw-packed ships to the southern states and throughout the Caribbean Sea. Most notable was Frederic Tudor (known as Boston's \\"Ice King\\") who formed the Tudor Ice Company in the early 19th century. In winter months, ice was chipped from a lake surface and often dragged by sled to the ice house. In summer months, icemen delivered it to residences in ice-wagons; the ice would then be stored in an icebox, which was used much like a modern refrigerator. As home and business refrigeration became more commonplace, ice houses fell into disuse, and the home ice delivery business declined until it had virtually disappeared by the late 1960s. Smaller ice houses, often no more than a sawdust pile covered by a makeshift roof or tarpaulin, continued to be maintained for storing ice for use in local events such as fairs. Today, most ice for daily consumption is made in a home freezer, while bulk ice is manufactured, distributed and sold like other retail commodities. = Southern ice houses = In Texas, former ice houses are a cultural tradition. Ice merchants diversified to sell groceries and cold beer, serving as early convenience stores and local gathering places. The widespread 7-Eleven chain of convenience stores in the U.S., first known as Tote'm Stores, developed from ice houses operated by the Southland ice manufacturing company in Dallas and San Antonio in the 1930s. Many Texas ice houses have since converted into open-air bars. In central Texas, southeast Texas (especially the Houston area), and the Texas Hill Country, the word \\"icehouse\\" has become a colloquialism for an establishment that derives the majority of its income from the sale of cold beer. Southland was not the only company in the Southern U.S. to develop a convenience-store corporation from an ice business. Munford, Incorporated, of Atlanta began in the early 20th century by vending both ice and coal from mule-drawn wagons, as the Atlantic Ice and Coal Company. By the 1970s, Munford, Inc. was operating a large chain of convenience stores with the name Majik Market (the company was sold in 1988 and filed Chapter 11 bankruptcy in 1990).

The coat of arms was originally created around the year 1580.  Background  = The lion in Nordic heraldry = Figure 2: Coat of arms of Valdemar Birgersson The heraldic lion is quite common in Western Europe, and several European countries incorporate it into their national coats of arms. In Nordic heraldry, the lion is first found in the coat of arms of Denmark in the later part of the 12th century. Starting in the 13th century, the territory of today's Finland was gradually incorporated into the Swedish kingdom, and this coincided with the period when coats of arms first came into use in northern Europe. The first known use of the lion in Sweden was on the royal seals of Erik Knutsson (died 1216) and Erik Eriksson (1216‚Äì50), who used two and three lions on their seal, respectively. The first king of the Folkunga family, Valdemar Birgersson (1239‚Äì1302), also used 3 lions on his seal (Figure 2). = Finland as a duchy = Folkunga coat of arms Figure 4: Seal of duke Valdemar Bengt Birgersson, the first Duke of Finland (1254‚Äì91, Duke from 1284 until 1291), and Valdemar Magnusson, the second Duke (died 1318, Duke of Finland from 1302 until 1317), both used the later Folkunga coat of arms, which was a crowned lion rampant with three bends sinister, the main difference being that Valdemar's arms had the field strewn with hearts (Figure 3). This version of the arms was quite similar to the modern coat of arms of Finland, but the lion did not yet brandish any weapon.  Creation  When John III assumed the title of \\"Grand Duke of Finland and Karelia\\", shortened to Grand Duke of Finland in 1577 (or soon thereafter), the lion became closely associated with Finland through the grand-ducal coats of arms (Figure 5). The grand-ducal coat of arms is thought to have resulted out of a combination of the G√∂ta lion (originating from the Folkunga lion) and the arms of Karelia (Figure 6). The result was that the lion brandishes one weapon and treads on another. Figure 5: Grand-ducal coat of arms of Finland, tomb of King Gustav Vasa (Uppsala cathedral, Sweden) Figure 6: Coat of arms of Karelia, tomb of King Gustav Vasa (Uppsala cathedral, Sweden) The best-known version of the grand-ducal coat of arms is found on the tomb of Gustavus I (1523‚Äì60) in the Uppsala cathedral (Figure 5). It has been suggested that either Duke John himself, or his brother Eric XIV, was leading the design work on the heraldic signs on the tomb. Neither statement can be confirmed, but it is known that Eric XIV showed an interest in heraldry. The monument was commissioned from Guillaume Boyen (Willem Boy), a Flemish architect and sculptor who had worked in Sweden. He started on the task in Antwerp in 1562, completing it 10 years later; however, the tomb was not in place in Uppsala until the early 1580s, and the finishing work lasted until 1591. In addition to the royal arms of Sweden and those of Finland, the arms of the 11 provinces are depicted. From Finland they include North and South Finland, as well as Tavastia and Karelia. The work of Willem Boy is of exceptional quality, which is perhaps explained by the fact that lions were a dominant feature in the heraldry of Flanders, and he would therefore have had a great deal of exposure to it before receiving the commission for the tomb of Gustavus I. The earliest known blazon from this period states that the arms of Finland represents A crowned lion of gold holding a sword in the right forepaw and trampling with both hindpaws on a Russian sabre (ryssesabel), surrounded by nine silver roses in a red field, over the shield a golden crown with a red cap. As both King Gustavus I and his son, John III, were involved in lengthy wars with Russia, it should come as no surprise that this was a central element in the arms of both the Grand Duchy of Finland, and in that of the coat of arms of the Finnish province of Karelia (Figure 6), which symbolizes the struggle between East and West. The purpose of the nine roses remains unknown, but are now mostly considered to be decorative only. They have sometimes been claimed to represent the nine historical provinces of Finland, but this hypothesis has not found support among prominent scholars.Article on the Coats of arms of Finland, can be found in ThisisFINLAND by Maunu Harmo, Master of Pol. Sc., Former President of Finnish Society of Heraldry. The number of towns in the nominal \\"Grand Duchy of Finland and Karelia\\" in 1580 were also nine,Turku, Porvoo, Rauma, Naantali, Pori, Vyborg, Eken√§s, Helsinki and Priozersk that had been captured from Russia in 1580. but no known historical research provides support for a link between the number of roses and the number of towns in Finland in 1580.  Evolution  = Swedish era = Figure 7: Coat of arms of Swedish Finland (1775) During the following centuries, the arms of Finland were to appear in different versions of varying artistic quality, and it was only in the late 19th century when the Uppsala lion was again taken into use as the prototype for the coat of arms of Finland. The lion experienced several changes during the 17th century. In the funeral banner of Charles X Gustavus (in 1660) it can be seen treading on the sabre with all three free paws; in drawings by Elias Brenner (in the Suecia antique et hodierna by Erik Dahlberg, printed in 1716), it is pictured with a double tail (queue fourch√©e) and with an almost walking posture. =Russian era= Figure 8: Coat of arms of Finland within imperial Russian arms After Finland had been ceded to Russia (as a consequence of the Swedish‚ÄìRussian war of 1808‚Äì1809), Elias Brenner's version of the lion was chosen by the authorities as the model for the new coat of arms of the Grand Duchy of Finland in the Russian Empire. The blazon in the decree of 26 October 1809 states: The shield has a red field, strewn with roses of silver, on which a golden lion with a crown of gold, standing on a silver saber, which it grasps with the left forepaw while holding in the right forepaw an upright sword. Obviously, any interpretation of the lion as trampling on a Russian sabre had been lost at this point in time. During the reform of the Russian official heraldry in 1857, the lion was again changed on the initiative of baron Bernhard Karl von K√∂hne. The blazon states: On a red field strewn with silver roses a crowned lion of gold, holding in the right forepaw an upright sword and in the left one a curved sword on which it rests with the right hindpaw. The main changes were that the lion had started to resemble a dog rather than a lion, and the crown on top of the shield had been changed to an arched crown without a cap, and with a small Russian eagle on the rim. The sword in the right forepaw had shrunk in size, to the point of resembling a dagger rather than a sword (Figure 8). During the years when the Russian emperors attempted russification of Finland (1899‚Äì1905 and 1908‚Äì17), the use of the arms of Finland increased significantly, and eventually became popular in the broader population. The director of the Finnish National Archives, Karl August Bomansson (1827‚Äì1906) made the first significant study on the arms of Finland in modern times. He restored the appearance of the arms in 1886, so that it closely resembled the Uppsala lion. However, there was a slight deviation on how the lion tramples on the saber, and the arched crown with the imperial eagle in the von K√∂hne version was replaced with a crown similar to that of a German princely crown. This version of the arms was subsequently used in the early years of Finnish independence. = Early independence = Figure 9: Unapproved design for the greater coat of arms Figure 10:Coat of arms of the Kingdom of Finland (1918) During the 1920s and 1930s, the national arms became the subject of some controversy, and the debate centered on whether the lion should be replaced with a bear, which had an important place in the national folklore. Already in 1557, the bear had emerged as the emblem of Finnia Septentrionalis (\\"North Finland\\", at the time roughly the same as Satakunta and northern Southwest Finland) and continues to be used as the coat of arms of Satakunta. However, outside Finland, the bear was usually regarded as a symbol of Russia. The debate was however not settled, and throughout most of the 20th century, versions of the arms were used that closely adhered to the Uppsala lion. In 1936, a state committee suggested a compromise that Finland should have a \\"greater\\" and a \\"smaller\\" coat of arms. The greater coat of arms was proposed to have two bears as supporters of the arms (Figure 9), with a base of spruce twigs and with the motto vapaa, vankka, vakaa (\\"free, firm, steadfast\\"). This would have given the bear a place in the national heraldry, but the design was never confirmed, nor was this version of the arms taken into use.Pikku J√§ttil√§inen. WSOY 1985. . Page 1040. = Today = The blazon of the national coat of arms was finally settled in 1978, when the law of 26 May 1978 (381/78) described the coat of arms as follows: On a red field, a crowned lion, the right forepaw replaced with an armoured hand brandishing a sword, trampling on a saber with the hindpaws, the lion, crowned and armed, the weapons hilted and the armour garnished gold, the blades and the armour silver, the field strewn with nine roses of silver.Law on the coat of arms of Finland (Laki Suomen vaakunasta 26.5.1978/381). Hosted by Finlex. (This is, however, a direct translation from Finnish; the heraldic blazon would be Gules, a lion crowned Or rampant striking with a sword Argent on his armoured dexter arm, trampling on a sabre Argent; surmounted with nine roses Argent) The coat of arms appears on the Finnish state flag. The Finnish lion is also used in a wide variety of emblems of different state authorities, often modified to depict the duties of the unit or the authority. On the other hand, the Finnish municipalities and regions usually use heraldic motifs drawn from elsewhere, leaving the lion for state use (exceptions exist, such as the Coat of arms of Jakobstad). The Finnish lion also appears as an armed force's generals' rank insignia and in the navy as part of an officer's rank insignia.

Opposite is the start of Matins in the Little Office, illustrated by the Annunciation to Joachim, as the start of a long cycle of the Life of the Virgin.Plummer, plates 1-2 An early 15th-century French book of hours (MS13, Society of Antiquaries of London) open to an illustration of the 'Adoration of the Magi'. Bequeathed to the Society in 1769 by the Revd Charles Lyttleton, Bishop of Carlisle and President of the Society (1765-8). The book of hours is a Christian devotional book popular in the Middle Ages. It is the most common type of surviving medieval illuminated manuscript. Like every manuscript, each manuscript book of hours is unique in one way or another, but most contain a similar collection of texts, prayers and psalms, often with appropriate decorations, for Christian devotion. Illumination or decoration is minimal in many examples, often restricted to decorated capital letters at the start of psalms and other prayers, but books made for wealthy patrons may be extremely lavish, with full-page miniatures. These illustrations would combine picturesque scenes of country life with sacred images. Books of hours were usually written in Latin (the Latin name for them is horae), although there are many entirely or partially written in vernacular European languages, especially Dutch. The English term primer is usually now reserved for those books written in English. Tens of thousands of books of hours have survived to the present day, in libraries and private collections throughout the world. The typical book of hours is an abbreviated form of the breviary which contained the Divine Office recited in monasteries. It was developed for lay people who wished to incorporate elements of monasticism into their devotional life. Reciting the hours typically centered upon the reading of a number of psalms and other prayers. A typical book of hours contains the Calendar of Church feasts, extracts from the Four Gospels, the Mass readings for major feasts, the Little Office of the Blessed Virgin Mary, the fifteen Psalms of Degrees, the seven Penitential Psalms, a Litany of Saints, an Office for the Dead and the Hours of the Cross.Danish Royal Library Most 15th-century books of hours have these basic contents. The Marian prayers Obsecro te (\\"I beseech thee\\") and O Intemerata (\\"O undefiled one\\") were frequently added, as were devotions for use at Mass, and meditations on the Passion of Christ, among other optional texts. History Example of a more affordable en thus more common book of hours: Excerpt from a \\"simple\\" Middle Dutch book of hours. Made in the 2nd half of the fifteenth century in Brabant. Even this level of decoration is richer than those of most books, though less than the lavish amounts of illumination in luxury books, which are the ones most often seen reproduced. The book of hours has its ultimate origin in the Psalter, which monks and nuns were required to recite. By the 12th century this had developed into the breviary, with weekly cycles of psalms, prayers, hymns, antiphons, and readings which changed with the liturgical season.Eamon Duffy, \\"A Very Personal Possession: Eamon Duffy Tells How a Careful Study of Surviving Books of Hours Can Tell Us Much About the Spiritual and Temporal Life of Their Owners and Much More Besides.\\" History Today 56.11 (Nov 2006): 12(7). Eventually a selection of texts was produced in much shorter volumes and came to be called a book of hours.John Harthan \\"The Book of Hours: With a Historical Survey and Commentary by John Harthan.: New York: Crowell, 1977. During the latter part of the thirteenth century the Book of Hours became popular as a personal prayer book for men and women who led secular lives. It consisted of a selection of prayers, psalms, hymns and lessons based on the liturgy of the clergy. Each book was unique in its content though all included the Hours of the Virgin Mary, devotions to be made during the eight canonical hours of the day, the reasoning behind the name 'Book of Hours'.Warwick Hirst, The Fine Art of Illumination, Heritage Collection, Nelson Meers Foundation, State Library of New South Wales, Sydney 2003. Many books of hours were made for women. There is some evidence that they were sometimes given as a wedding present from a husband to his bride.John Harthan Frequently they were passed down through the family, as recorded in wills. Although the most heavily illuminated books of hours were enormously expensive, a small book with little or no illumination was affordable much more widely, and increasingly so during the 15th century. The earliest surviving English example was apparently written for a laywoman living in or near Oxford in about 1240. It is smaller than a modern paperback but heavily illuminated with major initials, but no full-page miniatures. By the 15th century, there are also examples of servants owning their own Books of Hours. In a court case from 1500, a pauper woman is accused of stealing a domestic servant's prayerbook.Eamon Duffy Very rarely the books included prayers specifically composed for their owners, but more often the texts are adapted to their tastes or sex, including the inclusion of their names in prayers. Some include images depicting their owners, and some their coats of arms. These, together with the choice of saints commemorated in the calendar and suffrages, are the main clues for the identity of the first owner. Eamon Duffy explains how these books reflected the person who commissioned them. He claims that the \\"personal character of these books was often signaled by the inclusion of prayers specially composed or adapted for their owners.\\" Furthermore, he states that \\"as many as half the surviving manuscript Books of Hours have annotations, marginalia or additions of some sort. Such additions might amount to no more than the insertion of some regional or personal patron saint in the standardized calendar, but they often include devotional material added by the owner. Owners could write in specific dates important to them, notes on the months where things happened that they wished to remember, and even the images found within these books would be personalized to the owners- such as localized saints and local festivities.Duffy, E. (January 01, 2006). A VERY PERSONAL POSSESSION - Eamon Duffy tells how a careful study of surviving medieval Books of Hours can tell us much about the spiritual and temporal life of their owners and much more besides. History Today, 56,11, 12. By at least the 15th century, the Netherlands and Paris workshops were producing books of hours for stock or distribution, rather than waiting for individual commissions. These were sometimes with spaces left for the addition of personalized elements such as local feasts or heraldry. Black Hours, Morgan MS 493, Pentecost, Folios 18v, c 1475‚Äì80. Morgan Library & Museum, New York The style and layout for traditional books of hours became increasingly standardized around the middle of the thirteenth century. The new style can be seen in the books produced by the Oxford illuminator William de Brailes who ran a commercial workshop (he was in minor orders). His books included various aspects of the Church's breviary and other liturgical aspects for use by the laity. \\"He incorporated a perpetual calendar, Gospels, prayers to the Virgin Mary, the Stations of the Cross, prayers to the Holy Spirit, Penitential psalms, litanies, prayers for the dead, and suffrages to the Saints. The book‚Äôs goal was to help his devout patroness to structure her daily spiritual life in accordance with the eight canonical hours, Matins to Compline, observed by all devout members of the Church. The text, augmented by rubrication, gilding, miniatures, and beautiful illuminations, sought to inspire meditation on the mysteries of faith, the sacrifice made by Christ for man, and the horrors of hell, and to especially highlight devotion to the Virgin Mary whose popularity was at a zenith during the 13th century.\\"Webb, M., & Albers, M. J. (January 01, 2001). The Design Elements of Medieval Books of Hours. Journal of Technical Writing and Communication, 31, 354. This arrangement was maintained over the years as many aristocrats commissioned the production of their own books. By the end of the 15th century, the advent of printing made books more affordable and much of the emerging middle-class could afford to buy a printed book of hours, and new manuscripts were only commissioned by the very wealthy. Paper was rare and most books of hours consisted of parchment sheets made from the skins of either sheep or goats.[5] The Kitab salat al-sawai (1514), widely considered the first book in Arabic printed using moveable type, is a book of hours intended for Arabic-speaking Christians and presumably commissioned by Pope Julius II. Decorations A full-page miniature of May, from a calendar cycle by Simon Bening, early 16th century. Example of a French-Latin book of hours. The miniatures have didactical purposes. Excerpt from the Book of Hours of Alexandre Petau. Made in the 16th century, Rouen. As many books of hours are richly illuminated, they form an important record of life in the 15th and 16th centuries as well as the iconography of medieval Christianity. Some of them were also decorated with jewelled covers, portraits, and heraldic emblems. Some were bound as girdle books for easy carrying, though few of these or other medieval bindings have survived. Luxury books, like the Talbot Hours of John Talbot, 1st Earl of Shrewsbury, may include a portrait of the owner, and in this case his wife, kneeling in adoration of the Virgin and Child as a form of donor portrait. In expensive books, miniature cycles showed the Life of the Virgin or the Passion of Christ in eight scenes decorating the eight Hours of the Virgin, and the Labours of the Months and signs of the zodiac decorating the calendar. Secular scenes of calendar cycles include many of the best known images from books of hours, and played an important role in the early history of landscape painting. From the 14th century decorated borders round the edges of at least important pages were common in heavily illuminated books, including books of hours. At the beginning of the 15th century these were still usually based on foliage designs, and painted on a plain background, but by the second half of the century coloured or patterned backgrounds with images of all sorts of objects, were used in luxury books. Second-hand books of hours were often modified for new owners, even among royalty. After defeating Richard III, Henry VII gave Richard's book of hours to his mother, who modified it to include her name. Heraldry was usually erased or over- painted by new owners. Many have handwritten annotations, personal additions and marginal notes but some new owners also commissioned new craftsmen to include more illustrations or texts. Sir Thomas Lewkenor of Trotton hired an illustrator to add details to what is now known as the Lewkenor Hours. Flyleaves of some surviving books include notes of household accounting or records of births and deaths, in the manner of later family bibles. Some owners had also collected autographs of notable visitors to their house. Books of hours were often the only book in a house, and were commonly used to teach children to read, sometimes having a page with the alphabet to assist this. Towards the end of the 15th century, printers produced books of hours with woodcut illustrations, and the book of hours was one of the main works decorated in the related metalcut technique. The luxury book of hours Veronica, Vinca, Viola tricolor, Bellis perennis, and Chelidonium majus. The lower butterfly is Aglais urticae, the top left butterfly is Pieris rapae. The Latin text is a devotion to Saint Christopher). In the 14th century the book of hours overtook the psalter as the most common vehicle for lavish illumination. This partly reflected the increasing dominance of illumination both commissioned and executed by laymen rather than monastic clergy. From the late 14th century a number of bibliophile royal figures began to collect luxury illuminated manuscripts for their decorations, a fashion that spread across Europe from the Valois courts of France and the Burgundy, as well as Prague under Charles IV, Holy Roman Emperor and later Wenceslaus. A generation later, Duke Philip the Good of Burgundy was the most important collector of manuscripts, with several of his circle also collecting.Thomas, 8-9 It was during this period that the Flemish cities overtook Paris as the leading force in illumination, a position they retained until the terminal decline of the illuminated manuscript in the early 16th century. The most famous collector of all, the French prince John, Duke of Berry (1340‚Äì1416) owned several books of hours, some of which survive, including the most celebrated of all, the Tr√®s Riches Heures du Duc de Berry. This was begun around 1410 by the Limbourg brothers, although left incomplete by them, and decoration continued over several decades by other artists and owners. The same was true of the Turin- Milan Hours, which also passed through Berry's ownership. By the mid-15th century, a much wider group of nobility and rich businesspeople were able to commission highly decorated, often small, books of hours. With the arrival of printing, the market contracted sharply, and by 1500 the finest quality books were once again being produced only for royal or very grand collectors. One of the last major illuminated book of hours was the Farnese Hours completed for the Roman Cardinal Alessandro Farnese in 1546 by Giulio Clovio, who was also the last major manuscript illuminator.

The Duke is seated at the right, in blue. The Baptism of Saint Augustine, folio 37v The Nativity of Jesus, folio 44v The Tr√®s Riches Heures du Duc de Berry () or Tr√®s Riches Heures (), is the most famous and possibly the best surviving example of manuscript illumination in the late phase of the International Gothic style. It is a book of hours: a collection of prayers to be said at the canonical hours. It was created between and 1416 for the extravagant royal bibliophile and patron John, Duke of Berry, by the Limbourg brothers.Manion 1996, p. 308. When the three painters and their sponsor died in 1416, possibly victims of plague, the manuscript was left unfinished. It was further embellished in the 1440s by an anonymous painter, who many art historians believe was Barth√©lemy d'Eyck. In 1485‚Äì1489, it was brought to its present state by the painter Jean Colombe on behalf of the Duke of Savoy. Acquired by the Duc d'Aumale in 1856, the book is now MS 65 in the Mus√©e Cond√©, Chantilly, France. Consisting of a total of 206 leaves of very fine quality parchment, in height by in width, the manuscript contains 66 large miniatures and 65 small. The design of the book, which is long and complex, has undergone many changes and reversals. Many artists contributed to its miniatures, calligraphy, initials, and marginal decorations, but determining their precise number and identity remains a matter of debate. Painted largely by artists from the Low Countries, often using rare and costly pigments and gold,; originally published at humanities.uchicago.edu. and with an unusually large number of illustrations, the book is one of the most lavish late medieval illuminated manuscripts. After three centuries in obscurity, the Tr√®s Riches Heures gained wide recognition in the late nineteenth and twentieth centuries, despite having only very limited public exposure at the Mus√©e Cond√©. Its miniatures helped to shape an ideal image of the Middle Ages in the collective imagination, often being interpreted to serve political and nationalist agendas.Camille, throughout This is particularly true for the calendar images, which are the most commonly reproduced. They offer vivid representations of peasants performing agricultural work as well as aristocrats in formal attire, against a background of remarkable medieval architecture. Historical context The \\"Golden Age\\" of the book of hours in Europe took place from 1350‚Äì1480; the book of hours became popular in France around 1400 (Longnon, Cazelles and Meiss 1969). At this time many major French artists undertook manuscript illumination. =Duke of Berry= John, Duke of Berry, is the French prince for whom the Tr√®s Riches Heures was made. Berry was the third son of the future king of France, John the Good, and the brother and uncle of the next two kings. Little is known of Berry‚Äôs education, but it is certain that he spent his adolescence among arts and literature (Cazelles and Rathofer 1988). The young prince lived an extravagant life, necessitating frequent loans. He commissioned many works of art, which he amassed in his Saint Chapelle mansion. Upon Berry‚Äôs death in 1416, a final inventory was done on his estate that described the incomplete and unbound gatherings of the book as the \\"tr√®s riches heures\\" (\\"very rich[ly decorated] hours\\") to distinguish it from the 15 other books of hours in Berry's collection, including the Belles Heures (\\"beautiful hours\\") and Petites Heures (\\"little hours\\") (Cazelles and Rathofer 1988). =Provenance= The Tr√®s Riches Heures has changed ownership many times since its creation. The gatherings were certainly in Berry's estate on his death in 1416, but after this little is clear until 1485. A good deal is known about the lengthy and messy disposal of Berry's goods to satisfy his many creditors, which was disrupted by the insanity of the king and the Burgundian and English occupation of Paris, but there are no references to the manuscript.Reynolds, 526‚Äì528 It seems to have been in Paris for much of this period, and probably earlier; some borders suggest the style of the Parisian Bedford Master's workshop, and works from the 1410s to the 1440s by the Bedford workshop ‚Äî later taken over by the Dunois Master ‚Äî use border designs from other pages, suggesting that the manuscript was available for copying in Paris. Cover of the bound manuscript Duke Charles I of Savoy acquired the manuscript, probably as a gift, and commissioned Jean Colombe to complete the manuscript around 1485‚Äì1489. Sixteenth-century Flemish artists imitated the figures or entire compositions found in the calendar (Cazelles and Rathofer 1988). The manuscript belonged to Margaret of Austria, Duchess of Savoy (1480‚Äì1530), Governor of the Habsburg Netherlands from 1507 to 1515 and again from 1519 to 1530. After this its history is unknown until the 18th century, when it was given its present bookbinding with the arms of the Serra family of Genoa, Italy. It was inherited from the Serras by Baron Felix de Margherita of Turin and Milan. The French Orleanist pretender, Henri d'Orl√©ans, Duke of Aumale, then in exile at Twickenham near London, bought it from the baron in 1856. On his return to France in 1871 Aumale placed it in his library at the Ch√¢teau de Chantilly, which he bequeathed to the Institut de France as the home of the Mus√©e Cond√©.Camille, 72‚Äì77, 82; Pognon, 15 =Recent history= duc d'Aumale with a friend in his study at Chantilly When Aumale saw the manuscript in Genoa he was able to recognize it as a commission of Berry, probably because he was familiar with a set of plates of other manuscripts of Berry published in 1834, and subsidized by the government of the duke's father, King Louis Philippe I.Camille, 75 Aumale gave the German art historian Gustav Friedrich Waagen breakfast and a private view of the manuscript at Orleans House, just in time for a 10-page account to appear in Waagen's Galleries and Cabinets of Art in Great Britain in 1857, so beginning its rise to fame.Camille, 79‚Äì80 He also exhibited it in 1862 to the members of the Fine Arts Club.Camille, 78 The connection with the \\"tr√®s riches heures\\" listed in the 1416 inventory was made by L√©opold Victor Delisle of the Biblioth√®que nationale de France and communicated to Aumale in 1881, before being published in 1884 in the Gazette des Beaux-Arts; it has never been seriously disputed.Camille, 80‚Äì81 The manuscript took pride of place in a three-part article on all of Berry's manuscripts then known, and was the only one illustrated, with four plates in heliogravure.Camille, 83‚Äì84; Delisle However the manuscript was called the \\"Grandes Heures du duc de Berry\\" in this, a title now given to another manuscript, based on its larger page size. The name \\"Heures de Chantilly\\" was also used in the next decades.Camille, 84 A monograph with 65 heliogravure plates was published by Paul Durrieu in 1904, to coincide with a major exhibition of French Gothic art in Paris where it was exhibited in the form of 12 plates from the Durrieu monograph, as the terms of Aumale's bequest forbade its removal from Chantilly.Camille, 82, 86 The work became increasingly famous, and increasingly reproduced. The first colour reproductions, using the technique of photogravure, appeared in 1940 in the French art quarterly Verve. Each issue of this lavish magazine cost three hundred francs.Camille, 86‚Äì88 In January 1948, the very popular American photo-magazine Life published a feature with full-page reproductions of the 12 calendar scenes, at a little larger than their actual size but at very low- quality. Catering to American sensibilities of the time, the magazine censored one of the images by retouching the genitals of the peasant in the February scene.Camille, 86‚Äì90 The Mus√©e Cond√© decided in the 1980s, somewhat controversially, to remove the manuscript completely both from public display and scholarly access, replacing it with copies of a complete modern facsimile.Camille 1990, pp. 73‚Äì74. Note, however, that in 2008, Timothy Husband, Curator of the Department of Medieval Art at The Metropolitan Museum of Art, reported that he was allowed to examine the manuscript at the Chantilly Library for \\"many uninterrupted hours\\" (Husband 2008, p. viii). Michael Camille argues that this completes the logic of the reception history of a work that has almost entirely become famous through reproductions of its images, with the most famous images having been seen in the original by only a very small number of people. Artists The Limbourg brothers. Christ Led to Judgment, folio 143rHusband 2008, p. 314. There has been much debate regarding the identity and number of artists who contributed to the Tr√®s Riches Heures. =The Limbourg brothers= In 1884, L√©opold Delisle correlated the manuscript with the description of an item in an inventory drawn up after Berry's death: \\"several gatherings of a very rich book of hours [tr√®s riches heures], richly historiated and illuminated, that Pol [Paul] and his brothers made\\".Item XXV in Delisle 1884, p. 106: \\"une layette plusieurs cayers d'unes tr√®s riches heures que faisoient Pol et ses fr√®res, tr√®s richement historiez et enluminez\\". The English translation (without the bracketed explanatory additions) is from Manion 1996, p. 308. Delisle's resulting attribution to Paul de Limbourg and his two brothers, Jean and Herman, \\"has received general acceptance and also provided the manuscript with its name.\\" The three Limbourg brothers had originally worked under the supervision of Berry‚Äôs brother, Philip the Bold, Duke of Burgundy, on a Bible Moralis√©e and had come to work for Berry after Philip‚Äôs death. By 1411, the Limbourgs were permanent members of Berry's household (Cazelles and Rathofer 1988). It is also generally agreed that another of Berry's books of hours, the Belles Heures, completed between 1408 and 1409, can also be attributed to the brothers. It is thought that the Limbourg contribution to the Tr√®s Riches Heures was between about 1412 and their deaths in 1416. Documentation from 1416 was found indicating that Jean, followed by Paul and Herman, had died. Jean de Berry died later that year (Cazelles and Rathofer 1988). Apart from the main campaign of illumination, the text, border decorations, and gilding were most likely executed by assistants or specialists who remain unknown. The choice of castles in the calendar is one factor in the dating of the brothers' contribution. The Ch√¢teau of Bic√™tre, just outside Paris, was one of Berry's grandest residences, but does not appear in the calendar. It seems likely that this was because no image had been created by October 1411, when a large mob from Paris looted it and set it on fire in the Armagnac‚ÄìBurgundian Civil War. However the ch√¢teaux at Dourdan (April) and √âtampes (July) are both shown, although Berry lost them to the Burgundians at the end of 1411, with √âtampes being badly damaged in the siege.Pognon, 13 Man of Sorrows, with Duke Charles I of Savoy and his wife from 1485 to 1489; folio 75r =Jean Colombe= Folio 75 of the Tr√®s Riches Heures includes Duke Charles I of Savoy and his wife. The two were married in 1485 and the Duke died in 1489, implying that it was not one of the original folios. The second painter was identified by Paul Durrieu as Jean Colombe,Pognon, 10 who was paid 25 gold pieces by the Duke to complete certain canonical hours (Cazelles and Rathofer 1988). The funeral of Raymond Diocr√®s, folio 86v There were some miniatures which were incomplete and needed filling in, for example, the foreground figures and faces of the miniature illustrating the Office of the Dead, known as the Funeral of Raymond Diocr√®s.Manion 1996, p. 309. There are other subtle differences between the miniatures created by the Limbourgs and Colombe. Colombe chose to set large miniatures in frames of marble and gold columns. His faces are less delicate, with more pronounced features. He also used a very intense blue paint that is seen in the landscape of some miniatures. Colombe is worked in his own style without attempting to imitate that of the Limbourgs (Cazelles and Rathofer 1988). In folio 75 he followed the Limbourgs by including a depiction of one of his patron's castles in the Duchy of Savoy in the landscape background. =The Intermediate Painter= The \\"intermediate painter\\", also called the Master of the Shadows, as shadows are an element of his style, is often thought to be Barth√©lemy van Eyck (strictly the miniaturist known as the Master of Ren√© of Anjou, who is now normally identified with the documented painter Barth√©lemy van Eyck)Reynolds, 532 who would probably have been at work in the 1440s. Other scholars put his work as early as the 1420s, though there is no documentation for this.Pognon, 15 At any rate, the intermediate artist is assumed to have worked on the manuscript sometime between 1416 and 1485. Evidence from the artistic style, as well as the details of costume, suggests that the Limbourgs did not paint some of the calendar miniatures. Figures in the miniatures for January, April, May, and August are dressed in styles from 1420. The figures strolling in October are dressed in a sober fashion indicative of the mid-fifteenth century. It is known that the gatherings fell into hands of King Charles VII after Berry's death, and it is assumed that the intermediate painter is associated with his court (Cazelles and Rathofer 1988). Catherine Reynolds, in an article of 2005, approached the dating of the \\"intermediate painter\\"'s work through the borrowings from it visible in the work of other Parisian illuminators, and placed it in the late 1430s or at the start of the 1440s. This is inconveniently early for what she describes as the \\"generally accepted\\" identification with Barth√©lemy van Eyck, and in any case she detects a number of stylistic differences between van Eyck and the \\"intermediate painter.\\"Reynolds, 532‚Äì533 Jonathan Alexander sees no stylistic need to hypothesize an intermediate painter at all.Alexander February, attributed to Paul Limbourg, or the \\"Rustic painter\\" =Attribution of the calendar miniatures= The artists of the calendar miniatures have been identified as follows (Cazelles and Rathofer 1988): *January: Jean *February: Paul *March: Paul and Colombe *April: Jean *May: Jean *June: Paul, Jean, Herman, and Colombe (?) *July: Paul *August: Jean *September: Paul and Colombe *October: Paul and Colombe (?) *November: Colombe *December: Paul Pognon gives the following breakdown of the main miniatures in the Calendar, using more cautious stylistic names for the artists:Pognon, 12‚Äì13 * January: the courtly painter * February: the rustic painter * March: the courtly painter (landscape) and the Master of the Shadows (figures) * April: the courtly painter * May: the courtly painter * June: the rustic painter * July: the rustic painter * August: the courtly painter * September: the rustic painter (landscape)? and the Master of the Shadows (figures) * October: the Master of the Shadows * November: Jean Colombe * December: the Master of the Shadows In addition Pognon identifies the \\"pious painter\\" who painted many of the religious scenes later in the book during the initial campaign. The \\"courtly\\", \\"rustic\\" and \\"pious\\" painters would probably equate to the three Limbourg brothers, or perhaps other artists in their workshop. There are alternative analyses and divisions proposed by other specialists. Function A breviary consists of a number of prayers and readings in a short form, generally for use by the clergy. The book of hours is a simplified form of breviary designed for use by the laity where the prayers are intended for recital at the canonical hours of the liturgical day. Canonical hours refer to the division of day and night for the purpose of prayers. The regular rhythm of reading led to the term \\"book of hours\\".(Cazelles and Rathofer 1988) The book of hours consists of prayers and devotional exercises, freely arranged into primary, secondary and supplementary texts. Other than the calendar at the beginning, the order is random and can be customized for the recipient or region. The Hours of the Virgin were regarded as the most important, and therefore subject to the most lavish illustration. The Tr√®s Riches Heures is rare in that it includes several miracles performed before the commencement of the passion (Cazelles and Rathofer 1988).

All bi-folios are complete rectangles and the edges are unblemished and therefore must have been cut from the centre of skins of sufficient size. The folios measure 30 cm in height by 21.5 cm in width, although the original size was larger as evidenced by several cuts into the miniatures. The tears and natural flaws in the vellum are infrequent and almost go unnoticed (Cazelles and Rathofer 1988). =Illustrations= The ground colors were moistened with water and thickened with either gum Arabic or tragacanth gum. Approximately ten shades are used besides white and black. The detailed work required extremely small brushes and probably a lens (Longnon, Cazelles and Meiss 1969). Contents The contents of the book are typical of those of a book of hours, though the quantity of illumination is extremely unusual. *The Calendar: Folios 1‚Äì13 ::A generalized calendar (not specific to any year) of church feasts and saints' days, often illuminated with representations of the Labours of the Months, is a usual part of a book of hours, but the illustrations of the months in the Tr√®s Riches Heures are exceptional and innovative in their size, and the best known element of the decoration of the manuscript.Reynolds, 530 Up to this point any scenes of the labours had been smaller images on the same page as the calendar text, though later 15th-century calendars often adopted the Limbourg's innovation of a full-page miniature, though most had smaller pages than here. They were also unprecedented in mostly showing one of the duke's castles in the background. They are filled with details of the delights and labors of the months, from the Duke's court to his peasants, a counterpart to the prayers of the hours.Pognon, 10, 16‚Äì40 Each illustration is surmounted with its appropriate hemisphere showing a solar chariot, the signs and degrees of the zodiac, and numbering the days of the month and the martyrological letters for the ecclesiastic lunar calendar. Each month of the calendar is allotted an opening of two pages, on the righthand page the calendar listing notable feast days and on the left the miniature. January is the largest miniature in the calendar and includes the Duke of Berry at a New Year‚Äôs Day feast (Longnon, Cazelles and Meiss 1969). September, with the Ch√¢teau de Saumur ::Several of the miniatures depict the Duke, fields or castles he owned, and places he visited. This shows the personal function of the book of hours, as it is customized to suit the patron (Cazelles and Rathofer 1988). ::The September miniature was almost certainly painted in two phases: first, the upper section with the sky and ch√¢teau was painted in the middle of the fifteenth century, around 1438-1442, in the time of Ren√© d‚ÄôAnjou and Yolande d‚ÄôAragon; then the lower scene of grape-picking was completed by Jean Colombe from a sketch left by his predecessor. In general, artists started with the background, then painted in the characters before finishing with their faces. ::In the foreground, it is grape-picking time. The woman in a white and red apron looks pregnant. Other young peasants are picking the purple bunches, while one of them is tasting the grapes. A further character holding a basket is walking towards a mule which is carrying two panniers. The grapes are being loaded either into the mules' panniers or into the vats on the cart pulled by two oxen. ::In the background stands the Ch√¢teau de Saumur with its chimneys and weathervanes decorated with golden fleurs-de-lys. It was built by Louis II d'Anjou then given to his wife Yolande d‚ÄôAragon, the mother of King Ren√© and mother-in-law of Charles VII, over whom she had a considerable sway. The presence of this ch√¢teau can be explained by the important role played by Yolande in the early years of the reign of Charles VII and by how much the king enjoyed staying there. On the left, behind the enceinte, stands a clock- tower, the chimneys of the kitchens and a gate leading to a drawbridge. A horse is coming out and a woman with a basket on her head is on her way in. ::In front of the ch√¢teau, between the vines and the moat can be seen a tilting ground surrounded by palisades, where tournaments were held. ::The architectural design of the ch√¢teau draws the gaze up towards the dreamily poetic volutes. The towers conceal their protective nature beneath festive trappings, redolent of fabulous adventures in the forests of Arthurian legends and suggestive of the presence of God in His creation. As Fran√ßois Cali put it: \\"These extravagant towers are a dream landscape with constellations of canopies, pinnacles, gables and arrows, with their crockets fluttering against the light.\\" ::In the middle of the grape pickers, a character is showing his behind. This intentionally grotesque touch contrasts with the extraordinary elegance of the ch√¢teau. Jean Colombe's peasants lack the dignity they have in the other miniatures. The Anatomical Zodiac Man Purgatory, f. 113v, Jean Colombe *Anatomical Zodiac Man: Folio 14 ::The Anatomical Zodiac Man concludes the calendar. The twelve signs of the zodiac appear over the corresponding anatomical regions. It contains Berry's coat of arms of three fleurs-de-lis on a blue background. Such an image appears in no other book of hours, but astrology was one of Berry's interests, and several works on the subject were in Berry's library.Pognon, 40; Bober 1948, pp. 2‚Äì3; Cazelles and Rathofer The two figures are sometimes regarded as male and (looking out at the viewer) female, but Pognon finds both \\"strangely hermaphrodite\\", and intentionally so.Pognon, 40 *Readings from the Gospels: Folios 17‚Äì19 *Prayers to the Virgin: Folios 22‚Äì25 *Fall of Man: Folio 25 ::This part is represented in four stages within the same miniature. The Fall of Man is thought to have been by Jean de Limbourg and was to belong to a series of miniatures not originally intended for the Tr√®s Riches Heures. *Hours of the Virgin Matins: Folios 26‚Äì60 ::Illustrated with a cycle of the Life of the Virgin, with the page showing the Rest on the Flight to Egypt by Jean Colombe.Pognon, 66 *Psalms: Folio 61‚Äì63 ::The illustrations for the psalms employ a literal interpretation of the text that is rare for the late medieval period (Manion 1995). *The Penitential Psalms: Folio 64‚Äì71 ::This section begins with the \\"Fall of the Angels\\", which bears a lot of similarity to a panel painting by a Sienese painter dating from 1340 to 1348, now at the Louvre (Longnon, Cazelles and Meiss 1969). The Limbourgs may have known this work. This miniature has been identified as not originally intended for the Tr√®s Riches Heures. The final opening has a double-page image of the Procession of Saint Gregory that surrounds the text columns, with depictions of the skyline of Rome.Pognon, 71‚Äì73 *Hours of the Cross: Folios 75‚Äì78 ::In this section Christ is depicted as the Man of Sorrows, exhibiting wounds and surrounded by instruments of the passion. This is a common iconographic type in fourteenth-century manuscripts (Cazelles and Rathofer 1988). *Hours of the Holy Ghost: Folios 79‚Äì81 Pentecost, f. 79r *Office of the Dead: Folios 82‚Äì107 ::Colombe painted all the miniatures of this section, other than ‚ÄúHell‚Äù, which was painted by a Limbourg brother. ‚ÄúHell‚Äù is based on a description from a thirteenth-century Irish monk Tundal (Cazelles and Rathofer 1988). This miniature may not have been originally intended for the manuscript. Meiss and subsequent writers have argued that the full-page miniatures that codicological data show were inserted on single leaves were not originally designed for the Tr√®s Riches Heures (including the Anatomical Man, folio 14v; The Fall, folio 25r; the Meeting of the Magi, folio 51v; the Adoration of the Magi, folio 52r; the Presentation, folio 54v; the Fall of the Rebel Angels, folio 64v; Hell, folio 108r; the Map of Rome, folio 141v). Margaret Manion, however, has suggested that, \\"although the subjects are handled in an innovative manner, they fit within the context of the prayerbook and could well have been part of a developing collaborative plan.\\" ::The funeral image shows a reputed incident at the funeral of Raymond Diocres, a famous Parisian preacher, when in the middle of his Requiem Mass he was said to have lifted up his coffin lid, and announced to the congregation \\"I have been condemned to the just judgement of God\\".Pognon, 74 *Short Weekday Offices: Folios 109‚Äì140 ::The Presentation of the Virgin takes place in front of Bourges Cathedral, in Berry's ducal capital (Longnon, Cazelles and Meiss 1969). *Plan of Rome: Folio 141 *Hour of the Passion: Folio 142‚Äì157 *Masses for the Liturgical Year: Folios 158‚Äì204 ::Folio 201 depicts the martyrdom of Andrew the Apostle. The Duke of Berry was born on Saint Andrew's Day, 1340; consequently this miniature was of great importance to him (Cazelles and Rathofer 1988). Stylistic analysis The Limbourg brothers had artistic freedom but worked within a framework of the religious didactic manuscript. Several artistic innovations by the Limbourg brothers can be noticed in the Tr√®s Riches Heures. In the October miniature, the study of light was momentous for Western painting (Cazelles and Rathofer 1988). People were shown reflected in the water, the earliest representation of this type of reflection known thus far. Miniature scenes had new informality, with no strong framing forms at the edges. This allowed for continuity beyond the frame of view to be vividly defined. The Limbourgs developed a more naturalistic mode of representation and developed portraiture of people and surroundings. Religious figures do not inhabit free open space and courtiers are framed by vegetation. This is reminiscent of a more classical representation (Longnon, Cazelles and Meiss 1969). Some conventions used by the Limbourgs, such as a diaper background or the portrayal of night, were influenced by artists such as Taddeo Gaddi. These conventions were transformed completely into the artist's unique interpretation (Longnon, Cazelles and Meiss 1969). Manion offers a stylistic analysis of the psalter specifically. The psalters offer a systematic program of illuminations corresponding to the individual psalms. These images are linked together, but are not in the numerical order of the psalter. This emphasizes the idea of the abbreviated psalter, where each psalm is illustrated once (Manion 1995). The miniatures are not modeled on any specific visual or literary precedence when compared with other fourteenth century psalters. The manuscript offers a literal interpretation of the words and lacks a selection of more personal prayers. This emphasizes the didactic use of the book of hours (Manion 1995).

It is part of the Nevada System of Higher Education (NSHE). The college opened on September 3, 2002, as Nevada's first state college. Its main campus is located on a site in the southern foothills of Henderson. Nevada State College has around 3,300 undergraduate students from a variety of ethnic and cultural backgrounds. In terms of minority or underrepresented students at NSC, close to 20% of the student body is Hispanic/Latino, 11% is Black or African American, 10% is Asian, and 2% is Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander. The college's average student age is 29, and 61% of its students attend part-time. The vast majority of Nevada State College's students are from Nevada. Nevada State College's enrollment has grown from 177 students in 2002 to 3,389 in 2012, making it one of the fastest growing institutions of higher education in the country on a percentage basis. During this period, however, some of Nevada State College's programs suffered from lower than expected enrollments. However, enrollment for 2010 increased by 23.3% compared to the year before.Nevada State College Faces Possible Closures, CBS Channel 8 website. http://www.8newsnow.com/global/story.asp?s=12008480 Accessed February 19, 2010.Review-Journal http://www.reviewjournal.com/news/budgets-shrinking- enrollments Accessed March 24, 2010.

History In 1999, the Nevada Legislature created the Advisory Committee to Examine Locating a 4-Year State College in Henderson, Nev. In December 1999, the Nevada Board of Regents approved the establishment of Nevada State College. In February 2000, the committee recommended the new institution be named Nevada State College at Henderson. The committee members determined Henderson should be part of the official name as they felt additional state colleges would be created in the state. Later that month, the Henderson City Council, after having evaluated several potential sites, voted to locate Nevada State College northeast of Lake Mead Drive and Boulder Highway that was to be part of The LandWell Company's Provenance master-planned community. In March, James Rogers, owner of several television stations and later chancellor of the Nevada System of Higher Education, agreed to chair the college's foundation. Opponents of the creation of Nevada State College feared at the time that its creation would take resources from UNLV. However, proponents of the college argued the ‚Äúproposed college would be up to $3,000 cheaper than educating them at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas. The savings would come from smaller salaries for professors, who would teach four classes (per semester), rather than the three or fewer taught by UNLV professors.‚ÄùPatton, N. (January 4, 2001). Report urges state to fund new college. Review-Journal, p. 8B. In April 2000, the Board of Regents voted 8-3 to begin negotiations for the Boulder Highway / Lake Mead site despite some concerns that the site was near a permanent toxic waste storage facility. The original site of the college, first proposed in 2000 and on approximately 300 acres northeast of Lake Mead Drive and Boulder Highway near downtown Henderson raised environmental concerns as it was approximately one mile from a toxic waste storage facility, which prompted the Nevada Board of Regents in 2001 to select the college's present day siteMiller, V.

Among the different educational institutions of the NHSE, the largest 2009 budget cuts by the state legislature were for Nevada State College at 24.1%. Neighboring College of Southern Nevada had its budget cut by only 4.9%. Students protestested the cuts which left student services understaffed and about 25% of the university's teaching and administrative positions vacant in 2008. The Nevada System of Higher Education faced a $900 million budget deficit and there were proposals to close down Nevada State College along with other NHSE programs and schools.

The future Christenson Education Building and the Student Village dorm buildings are currently under construction. NSC currently leases the Dawson building on Nevada State Dr. which was originally the only building when the college opened, and purchased the J. Russell and Carol Raker Student Success Center on Paradise Hills Dr. which contains the financial aid office and student advising. NSC no longer leases two auxiliary buildings in downtown Henderson on Water Street. =On-going campus planning activities= In 2010, the Nevada Board of Regents approved the college's campus master plan, which calls for the development of roughly six million square feet of academic, residential, retail, and cultural space by full campus build-out in order to accommodate 25,000-30,000 students. =Sustainability Initiatives= As it relates to sustainable planning and design, NSC's campus master plan is informed by three central goals: (1) achieve operational carbon neutrality, (2) become a model of sustainable development for the city, county and region, and (3) enable the campus to serve as a learning and training tool for topics related to sustainable development. Academics NSC's Board-approved mission is to provide \\"educational, social, cultural, economic and civic advancement to the citizens of Nevada. To this end, the college addresses the state‚Äôs need for increased access to higher education through teaching practices and support services that promote the success of its largely first-generation, low income, under-represented student population. Nevada State College places special emphasis on meeting the state‚Äôs need for highly skilled, well-educated teachers and nurses and offers a wide range of baccalaureate degree programs grounded in the liberal arts and sciences.\\" =Accreditation= In August 2011, Nevada State College received independent accreditation at the baccalaureate degree level from the Northwest Commission on Colleges and Universities. The Northwest Commission on Colleges and Universities approved NSC as a Candidate for Accreditation in July 2006.

In geometry, Euler's rotation theorem states that, in three-dimensional space, any displacement of a rigid body such that a point on the rigid body remains fixed, is equivalent to a single rotation about some axis that runs through the fixed point. It also means that the composition of two rotations is also a rotation. Therefore the set of rotations has a group structure, known as a rotation group. The theorem is named after Leonhard Euler, who proved it in 1775 by means of spherical geometry. The axis of rotation is known as an Euler axis, typically represented by a unit vector . Its product by the rotation angle is known as an axis-angle. The extension of the theorem to kinematics yields the concept of instant axis of rotation, a line of fixed points. In linear algebra terms, the theorem states that, in 3D space, any two Cartesian coordinate systems with a common origin are related by a rotation about some fixed axis. This also means that the product of two rotation matrices is again a rotation matrix and that for a non-identity rotation matrix one eigenvalue is 1 and the other two are both complex, or both equal to ‚àí1. The eigenvector corresponding to this eigenvalue is the axis of rotation connecting the two systems. Euler's theorem (1776) Euler states the theorem as follows:Novi Commentarii academiae scientiarum Petropolitanae 20, 1776, pp. 189‚Äì207 (E478) > Theorema. Quomodocunque sphaera circa centrum suum conuertatur, semper > assignari potest diameter, cuius directio in situ translato conueniat cum > situ initiali.'' or (in English): > When a sphere is moved around its centre it is always possible to find a > diameter whose direction in the displaced position is the same as in the > initial position. Figure 1: Blue great circle on sphere transforms into red great circle when rotated about diameter through . =Proof= Euler's original proof was made using spherical geometry and therefore whenever he speaks about triangles they must be understood as spherical triangles. Previous analysis To arrive at a proof, Euler analyses what the situation would look like if the theorem were true. To that end, suppose the yellow line in Figure 1 goes through the center of the sphere and is the axis of rotation we are looking for, and point is one of the two intersection points of that axis with the sphere. Then he considers an arbitrary great circle that does not contain (the blue circle), and its image after rotation (the red circle), which is another great circle not containing . He labels a point on their intersection as point . (If the circles coincide, then can be taken as any point on either; otherwise is one of the two points of intersection.) Figure 2: Arcs connecting preimage and image of with bisector of the angle at . Now is on the initial circle (the blue circle), so its image will be on the transported circle (red). He labels that image as point . Since is also on the transported circle (red), it is the image of another point that was on the initial circle (blue) and he labels that preimage as (see Figure 2). Then he considers the two arcs joining and to . These arcs have the same length because arc is mapped onto arc . Also, since is a fixed point, triangle is mapped onto triangle , so these triangles are isosceles, and arc bisects angle . Figure 3: goes to , but must coincide with . Construction of the best candidate point Let us construct a point that could be invariant using the previous considerations. We start with the blue great circle and its image under the transformation, which is the red great circle as in the Figure 1. Let point be a point of intersection of those circles. If ‚Äôs image under the transformation is the same point then is a fixed point of the transformation, and since the center is also a fixed point, the diameter of the sphere containing is the axis of rotation and the theorem is proved. Otherwise we label ‚Äôs image as and its preimage as , and connect these two points to with arcs and . These arcs have the same length. Construct the great circle that bisects and locate point on that great circle so that arcs and have the same length, and call the region of the sphere containing and bounded by the blue and red great circles the interior of . (That is, the yellow region in Figure 3.) Then since and is on the bisector of , we also have . Proof of its invariance under the transformation Now let us suppose that is the image of . Then we know and orientation is preserved, so must be interior to . Now is transformed to , so . Since is also the same length as , . But , so and therefore is the same point as . In other words, is a fixed point of the transformation, and since the center is also a fixed point, the diameter of the sphere containing is the axis of rotation. Final notes about the construction Euler's original drawing Euler also points out that can be found by intersecting the perpendicular bisector of with the angle bisector of , a construction that might be easier in practice. He also proposed the intersection of two planes: *the symmetry plane of the angle (which passes through the center of the sphere), and *the symmetry plane of the arc (which also passes through ). :Proposition. These two planes intersect in a diameter. This diameter is the one we are looking for. :Proof. Let us call either of the endpoints (there are two) of this diameter over the sphere surface. Since is mapped on and the triangles have the same angles, it follows that the triangle is transported onto the triangle . Therefore the point has to remain fixed under the movement. :Corollaries. This also shows that the rotation of the sphere can be seen as two consecutive reflections about the two planes described above. Points in a mirror plane are invariant under reflection, and hence the points on their intersection (a line: the axis of rotation) are invariant under both the reflections, and hence under the rotation. Another simple way to find the rotation axis is by considering the plane on which the points , , lie. The rotation axis is obviously orthogonal to this plane, and passes through the center of the sphere. Given that for a rigid body any movement that leaves an axis invariant is a rotation, this also proves that any arbitrary composition of rotations is equivalent to a single rotation around a new axis. Matrix proof A spatial rotation is a linear map in one-to-one correspondence with a rotation matrix that transforms a coordinate vector into , that is . Therefore, another version of Euler's theorem is that for every rotation , there is a nonzero vector for which ; this is exactly the claim that is an eigenvector of associated with the eigenvalue 1. Hence it suffices to prove that 1 is an eigenvalue of ; the rotation axis of will be the line , where is the eigenvector with eigenvalue 1. A rotation matrix has the fundamental property that its inverse is its transpose, that is : \\\\mathbf{R}^\\\\mathsf{T}\\\\mathbf{R} = \\\\mathbf{R}\\\\mathbf{R}^\\\\mathsf{T} = \\\\mathbf{I}, where is the identity matrix and superscript T indicates the transposed matrix. Compute the determinant of this relation to find that a rotation matrix has determinant ¬±1. In particular, : 1=\\\\det(\\\\mathbf{I})=\\\\det\\\\left(\\\\mathbf{R}^\\\\mathsf{T}\\\\mathbf{R}\\\\right) = \\\\det\\\\left(\\\\mathbf{R}^\\\\mathsf{T}\\\\right)\\\\det(\\\\mathbf{R}) = \\\\det(\\\\mathbf{R})^2 \\\\quad\\\\Longrightarrow \\\\quad \\\\det(\\\\mathbf{R}) = \\\\pm 1. A rotation matrix with determinant +1 is a proper rotation, and one with a negative determinant ‚àí1 is an improper rotation, that is a reflection combined with a proper rotation. It will now be shown that a proper rotation matrix has at least one invariant vector , i.e., . Because this requires that , we see that the vector must be an eigenvector of the matrix with eigenvalue . Thus, this is equivalent to showing that . Use the two relations : \\\\det(-\\\\mathbf{A}) = (-1)^{3} \\\\det(\\\\mathbf{A}) = - \\\\det(\\\\mathbf{A}) \\\\quad for any matrix A and : \\\\det\\\\left(\\\\mathbf{R}^{-1} \\\\right) = 1 \\\\quad (since ) to compute :\\\\begin{align} \\\\det(\\\\mathbf{R} - \\\\mathbf{I}) =\\\\det\\\\left((\\\\mathbf{R} - \\\\mathbf{I})^\\\\mathsf{T}\\\\right) &= \\\\det\\\\left(\\\\mathbf{R}^\\\\mathsf{T} - \\\\mathbf{I}\\\\right) = \\\\det\\\\left(\\\\mathbf{R}^{-1} - \\\\mathbf{R}^{-1}\\\\mathbf{R}\\\\right) \\\\\\\\\\\\ &= \\\\det\\\\left(\\\\mathbf{R}^{-1} (\\\\mathbf{I} - \\\\mathbf{R}) \\\\right) = \\\\det\\\\left(\\\\mathbf{R}^{-1} \\\\right) \\\\, \\\\det( -(\\\\mathbf{R} - \\\\mathbf{I}) ) = - \\\\det(\\\\mathbf{R} - \\\\mathbf{I})\\\\quad \\\\Longrightarrow\\\\quad \\\\det(\\\\mathbf{R} - \\\\mathbf{I}) = 0. \\\\end{align} This shows that is a root (solution) of the characteristic equation, that is, : \\\\det(\\\\mathbf{R} - \\\\lambda \\\\mathbf{I}) = 0\\\\quad \\\\hbox{for}\\\\quad \\\\lambda=1. In other words, the matrix is singular and has a non-zero kernel, that is, there is at least one non-zero vector, say , for which : (\\\\mathbf{R} - \\\\mathbf{I}) \\\\mathbf{n} = \\\\mathbf{0} \\\\quad \\\\Longleftrightarrow \\\\quad \\\\mathbf{R}\\\\mathbf{n} = \\\\mathbf{n}. The line for real is invariant under , i.e., is a rotation axis. This proves Euler's theorem. Equivalence of an orthogonal matrix to a rotation matrix Two matrices (representing linear maps) are said to be equivalent if there is a change of basis that makes one equal to the other. A proper orthogonal matrix is always equivalent (in this sense) to either the following matrix or to its vertical reflection: : \\\\mathbf{R} \\\\sim \\\\begin{pmatrix} \\\\cos\\\\phi & -\\\\sin\\\\phi & 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\sin\\\\phi & \\\\cos\\\\phi & 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & 0 & 1\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\end{pmatrix}, \\\\qquad 0\\\\le \\\\phi \\\\le 2\\\\pi. Then, any orthogonal matrix is either a rotation or an improper rotation. A general orthogonal matrix has only one real eigenvalue, either +1 or ‚àí1. When it is +1 the matrix is a rotation. When ‚àí1, the matrix is an improper rotation. If has more than one invariant vector then and . Any vector is an invariant vector of . =Excursion into matrix theory= In order to prove the previous equation some facts from matrix theory must be recalled. An matrix has orthogonal eigenvectors if and only if is normal, that is, if . This result is equivalent to stating that normal matrices can be brought to diagonal form by a unitary similarity transformation: : \\\\mathbf{A}\\\\mathbf{U} = \\\\mathbf{U}\\\\; \\\\operatorname{diag}(\\\\alpha_1,\\\\ldots,\\\\alpha_m)\\\\quad \\\\Longleftrightarrow\\\\quad \\\\mathbf{U}^\\\\dagger \\\\mathbf{A}\\\\mathbf{U} = \\\\operatorname{diag}(\\\\alpha_1,\\\\ldots,\\\\alpha_m), and is unitary, that is, : \\\\mathbf{U}^\\\\dagger = \\\\mathbf{U}^{-1}. The eigenvalues are roots of the characteristic equation. If the matrix happens to be unitary (and note that unitary matrices are normal), then : \\\\left(\\\\mathbf{U}^\\\\dagger\\\\mathbf{A} \\\\mathbf{U}\\\\right)^\\\\dagger = \\\\operatorname{diag}\\\\left(\\\\alpha^*_1,\\\\ldots,\\\\alpha^*_m\\\\right) = \\\\mathbf{U}^\\\\dagger\\\\mathbf{A}^{-1} \\\\mathbf{U} = \\\\operatorname{diag}\\\\left(\\\\frac{1}{\\\\alpha_1},\\\\ldots,\\\\frac{1}{\\\\alpha_m}\\\\right) and it follows that the eigenvalues of a unitary matrix are on the unit circle in the complex plane: : \\\\alpha^*_k = \\\\frac{1}{\\\\alpha_k} \\\\quad\\\\Longleftrightarrow\\\\quad \\\\alpha^*_k\\\\alpha_k = \\\\left\\\\alpha_k\\\\right^2 = 1,\\\\qquad k=1,\\\\ldots,m. Also an orthogonal (real unitary) matrix has eigenvalues on the unit circle in the complex plane. Moreover, since its characteristic equation (an th order polynomial in ) has real coefficients, it follows that its roots appear in complex conjugate pairs, that is, if is a root then so is . There are 3 roots, thus at least one of them must be purely real (+1 or ‚àí1). After recollection of these general facts from matrix theory, we return to the rotation matrix . It follows from its realness and orthogonality that we can find a such that: : \\\\mathbf{R} \\\\mathbf{U} = \\\\mathbf{U} \\\\begin{pmatrix} e^{i\\\\phi} & 0 & 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & e^{-i\\\\phi} & 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & 0 & \\\\pm 1 \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\end{pmatrix} If a matrix can be found that gives the above form, and there is only one purely real component and it is ‚àí1, then we define R to be an improper rotation. Let us only consider the case, then, of matrices R that are proper rotations (the third eigenvalue is just 1). The third column of the matrix will then be equal to the invariant vector . Writing and for the first two columns of , this equation gives : \\\\mathbf{R}\\\\mathbf{u}_1 = e^{i\\\\phi}\\\\, \\\\mathbf{u}_1 \\\\quad\\\\hbox{and}\\\\quad \\\\mathbf{R}\\\\mathbf{u}_2 = e^{-i\\\\phi}\\\\, \\\\mathbf{u}_2. If has eigenvalue 1, then and has also eigenvalue 1, which implies that in that case . Finally, the matrix equation is transformed by means of a unitary matrix, : \\\\mathbf{R} \\\\mathbf{U} \\\\begin{pmatrix} \\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{2}} & \\\\frac{i}{\\\\sqrt{2}} & 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{2}} & \\\\frac{-i}{\\\\sqrt{2}} & 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & 0 & 1\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\end{pmatrix} = \\\\mathbf{U} \\\\underbrace{ \\\\begin{pmatrix} \\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{2}} & \\\\frac{i}{\\\\sqrt{2}} & 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{2}} & \\\\frac{-i}{\\\\sqrt{2}} & 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & 0 & 1\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\end{pmatrix} \\\\begin{pmatrix} \\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{2}} & \\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{2}} & 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\frac{-i}{\\\\sqrt{2}} & \\\\frac{i}{\\\\sqrt{2}} & 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & 0 & 1\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\end{pmatrix} }_{=\\\\;\\\\mathbf{I}} \\\\begin{pmatrix} e^{i\\\\phi} & 0 & 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & e^{-i\\\\phi} & 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & 0 & 1 \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\end{pmatrix} \\\\begin{pmatrix} \\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{2}} & \\\\frac{i}{\\\\sqrt{2}} & 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{2}} & \\\\frac{-i}{\\\\sqrt{2}} & 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & 0 & 1\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\end{pmatrix} which gives : \\\\mathbf{U'}^\\\\dagger \\\\mathbf{R} \\\\mathbf{U'} = \\\\begin{pmatrix} \\\\cos\\\\phi & -\\\\sin\\\\phi & 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\sin\\\\phi & \\\\cos\\\\phi & 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & 0 & 1\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\end{pmatrix} \\\\quad\\\\text{ with }\\\\quad \\\\mathbf{U'} = \\\\mathbf{U} \\\\begin{pmatrix} \\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{2}} & \\\\frac{i}{\\\\sqrt{2}} & 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{2}} & \\\\frac{-i}{\\\\sqrt{2}} & 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & 0 & 1\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\end{pmatrix} . The columns of are orthonormal. The third column is still , the other two columns are perpendicular to . We can now see how our definition of improper rotation corresponds with the geometric interpretation: an improper rotation is a rotation around an axis (here, the axis corresponding to the third coordinate) and a reflection on a plane perpendicular to that axis. If we only restrict ourselves to matrices with determinant 1, we can thus see that they must be proper rotations. This result implies that any orthogonal matrix corresponding to a proper rotation is equivalent to a rotation over an angle around an axis . Equivalence classes The trace (sum of diagonal elements) of the real rotation matrix given above is . Since a trace is invariant under an orthogonal matrix similarity transformation, : \\\\mathrm{Tr}\\\\left[\\\\mathbf{A} \\\\mathbf{R} \\\\mathbf{A}^\\\\mathsf{T}\\\\right] = \\\\mathrm{Tr}\\\\left[ \\\\mathbf{R} \\\\mathbf{A}^\\\\mathsf{T}\\\\mathbf{A}\\\\right] = \\\\mathrm{Tr}[\\\\mathbf{R}]\\\\quad\\\\text{ with }\\\\quad \\\\mathbf{A}^\\\\mathsf{T} = \\\\mathbf{A}^{-1}, it follows that all matrices that are equivalent to by such orthogonal matrix transformations have the same trace: the trace is a class function. This matrix transformation is clearly an equivalence relation, that is, all such equivalent matrices form an equivalence class. In fact, all proper rotation rotation matrices form a group, usually denoted by SO(3) (the special orthogonal group in 3 dimensions) and all matrices with the same trace form an equivalence class in this group. All elements of such an equivalence class share their rotation angle, but all rotations are around different axes. If is an eigenvector of with eigenvalue 1, then is also an eigenvector of T, also with eigenvalue 1. Unless , and are different. Applications =Generators of rotations= Suppose we specify an axis of rotation by a unit vector , and suppose we have an infinitely small rotation of angle about that vector. Expanding the rotation matrix as an infinite addition, and taking the first order approach, the rotation matrix is represented as: : \\\\Delta R = \\\\begin{bmatrix} 1&0&0\\\\\\\\\\\\ 0&1&0\\\\\\\\\\\\ 0&0&1 \\\\end{bmatrix} \\\\+ \\\\begin{bmatrix} 0 & z&-y\\\\\\\\\\\\ -z& 0& x\\\\\\\\\\\\ y &-x& 0 \\\\end{bmatrix}\\\\,\\\\Delta \\\\theta = \\\\mathbf{I}+\\\\mathbf{A}\\\\,\\\\Delta \\\\theta. A finite rotation through angle about this axis may be seen as a succession of small rotations about the same axis. Approximating as where is a large number, a rotation of about the axis may be represented as: : R =\\\\left(\\\\mathbf{1}+\\\\frac{\\\\mathbf{A}\\\\theta}{N}\\\\right)^N \\\\approx e^{\\\\mathbf{A}\\\\theta}. It can be seen that Euler's theorem essentially states that all rotations may be represented in this form. The product is the \\"generator\\" of the particular rotation, being the vector associated with the matrix . This shows that the rotation matrix and the axis‚Äìangle format are related by the exponential function. One can derive a simple expression for the generator . One starts with an arbitrary plane (in Euclidean space) defined by a pair of perpendicular unit vectors and . In this plane one can choose an arbitrary vector with perpendicular . One then solves for in terms of and substituting into an expression for a rotation in a plane yields the rotation matrix which includes the generator . :\\\\begin{align} \\\\mathbf{x}&=\\\\mathbf{a}\\\\cos \\\\alpha + \\\\mathbf{b}\\\\sin \\\\alpha \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\mathbf{y}&=-\\\\mathbf{a}\\\\sin \\\\alpha + \\\\mathbf{b}\\\\cos \\\\alpha \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\cos \\\\alpha &= \\\\mathbf{a}^\\\\mathsf{T}\\\\mathbf{x} \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\sin \\\\alpha &= \\\\mathbf{b}^\\\\mathsf{T}\\\\mathbf{x} \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[8px] \\\\mathbf{y} &= -\\\\mathbf{ab}^\\\\mathsf{T}\\\\mathbf{x}+\\\\mathbf{ba}^\\\\mathsf{T}\\\\mathbf{x}=\\\\left( \\\\mathbf{ba}^\\\\mathsf{T}-\\\\mathbf{ab}^\\\\mathsf{T} \\\\right)\\\\mathbf{x} \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[8px] \\\\mathbf{x}'&=\\\\mathbf{x}\\\\cos \\\\beta + \\\\mathbf{y}\\\\sin \\\\beta \\\\\\\\\\\\ &=\\\\left( \\\\mathbf{I}\\\\cos \\\\beta +\\\\left( \\\\mathbf{ba}^\\\\mathsf{T}-\\\\mathbf{ab}^\\\\mathsf{T} \\\\right)\\\\sin \\\\beta \\\\right)\\\\mathbf{x} \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[8px] \\\\mathbf{R} &= \\\\mathbf{I}\\\\cos \\\\beta + \\\\left( \\\\mathbf{ba}^\\\\mathsf{T}-\\\\mathbf{ab}^\\\\mathsf{T} \\\\right)\\\\sin\\\\beta \\\\\\\\\\\\ &= \\\\mathbf{I} \\\\cos \\\\beta + \\\\mathbf{G} \\\\sin \\\\beta \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[8px] \\\\mathbf{G} &= \\\\mathbf{ba}^\\\\mathsf{T}-\\\\mathbf{ab}^\\\\mathsf{T} \\\\end{align} To include vectors outside the plane in the rotation one needs to modify the above expression for by including two projection operators that partition the space. This modified rotation matrix can be rewritten as an exponential function. :\\\\begin{align} \\\\mathbf{P_{ab}} &= -\\\\mathbf{G}^2 \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\mathbf{R} &= \\\\mathbf{I} - \\\\mathbf{P_{ab}} + \\\\left( \\\\mathbf{I} \\\\cos \\\\beta + \\\\mathbf{G} \\\\sin \\\\beta \\\\right)\\\\mathbf{P_{ab}}= e^{\\\\mathbf{G}\\\\beta } \\\\end{align} Analysis is often easier in terms of these generators, rather than the full rotation matrix. Analysis in terms of the generators is known as the Lie algebra of the rotation group. =Quaternions= It follows from Euler's theorem that the relative orientation of any pair of coordinate systems may be specified by a set of three independent numbers. Sometimes a redundant fourth number is added to simplify operations with quaternion algebra. Three of these numbers are the direction cosines that orient the eigenvector. The fourth is the angle about the eigenvector that separates the two sets of coordinates. Such a set of four numbers is called a quaternion. While the quaternion as described above, does not involve complex numbers, if quaternions are used to describe two successive rotations, they must be combined using the non-commutative quaternion algebra derived by William Rowan Hamilton through the use of imaginary numbers. Rotation calculation via quaternions has come to replace the use of direction cosines in aerospace applications through their reduction of the required calculations, and their ability to minimize round-off errors. Also, in computer graphics the ability to perform spherical interpolation between quaternions with relative ease is of value. Generalizations In higher dimensions, any rigid motion that preserves a point in dimension or is a composition of at most rotations in orthogonal planes of rotation, though these planes need not be uniquely determined, and a rigid motion may fix multiple axes. A screw motion. A rigid motion in three dimensions that does not necessarily fix a point is a \\"screw motion\\". This is because a composition of a rotation with a translation perpendicular to the axis is a rotation about a parallel axis, while composition with a translation parallel to the axis yields a screw motion; see screw axis. This gives rise to screw theory.

She appeared in the first-ever episode, broadcast on 9 December 1960, and stayed with the show until 2 April 1980. Development Ena was the widowed caretaker of the Glad Tidings Mission Hall and spent much of her time criticising the activities and loose morals of the street's other residents. One of the main characters during the 1960s, she was featured less regularly in the 1970s due to the declining health of actress Violet Carson, and was written out in 1980. Almost always wearing a double-breasted overcoat and hairnet, she spent much of her free time in the series' early years with her two cronies, Martha Longhurst (Lynne Carol) and Minnie Caldwell (Margot Bryant), in the snug bar of local pub The Rovers Return Inn, drinking milk stout. Ena particularly criticised Elsie Tanner (Pat Phoenix), whom she believed had loose morals. In turn, Elsie strongly disliked Ena for her seemingly incessant gossip and desire to know about the private lives of others; and the two confronted each other frequently. The final episode featuring Ena was broadcast on 2 April 1980. It attracted little media or public attention, as the producers intended her to continue in the series ‚Äì the character was merely going to stay with a friend, Henry Foster, in St Annes while her flat in Coronation Street was being renovated. Unfortunately all subsequent storylines involving Ena had to be scrapped owing to Carson being too ill to appear, due to the symptoms of pernicious anemia. Violet Carson died on Boxing Day 1983 at the age of 85, thus putting to rest any rumours of Ena's return. Following her departure in 1980 no further mention of Ena was made, and it was assumed she had moved to St Annes permanently. The first reference to her after this was in the 1985 spin-off video \\"The Jubilee Years\\" when Ken Barlow revealed that Ena died \\"a couple of years ago\\", placing her death around the same time as that of Carson's. The first mention of Ena's death in the show itself was on 27 November 1989, during a scene in the Rovers Return when Deirdre says to builder Maurice Jones: \\"Ena Sharples would be turning in her grave.\\" In 2010 a short online video titled \\"Ken: A Life On The Street\\" reiterated that she was no longer alive when Ken Barlow (William Roache) told his grandson Simon (Alex Bain) that she was \\"long dead now\\". This is available as an extra on the Tram Crash DVD, released in 2011. Storylines =Backstory= Ena Schofield was born in Weatherfield on 24 November 1899. She had two elder siblings, Alice Raynold (n√©e Schofield) (1885‚Äì1965) and Tom Schofield (d. 1973). During her school days Ena met Martha Hartley (Lynne Carol) and Minnie Carlton (Margot Bryant), establishing lifelong friendships. An attentive student with a strong Christian upbringing, Ena became devoted to her religion and developed a firm belief in the importance of rules, regulations and morals. She also quickly learned to be self-sufficient, taking on factory work when she was only 11. In 1915 Ena became engaged to Phil Moss, nephew of Gladys Arkwright, her mentor at the Glad Tidings Mission Hall. However he enlisted for military service in the Great War and was killed in battle, devastating Ena. In 1914 Ena had become friends with Albert Tatlock after Dinky Low, a local boy Ena had a crush on, asked her to write to Albert. Ena and Albert became close enough that he would stay with her family while on leave but, when he asked her if she wanted to be more than friends, she declined, stating that she was still mourning Phil. Around 1917 Ena met Alfred Sharples, who had been sent home because of a leg injury. There was an instant chemistry but Ena was upset to learn he was already married, and broke contact with him. When the war ended Alfred and Ena met up again and he told her that his marriage had been in name only ‚Äì he'd had to marry the daughter of someone his father had owed money to. Alfred also informed Ena that his wife had recently died, so Ena decided to give him another chance. Ena married Alfred in 1920 and they had three children: Vera, Madge and Ian. Ian died after only two days and Alfred died in 1937 during the Depression, leaving Ena a widow with two children. As Vera and Madge grew up Ena alienated them through her judgemental and frequently interfering nature ‚Äì a point of much contention for Ena. Madge and her mother became almost completely estranged after Madge emigrated in 1950. =1960‚Äì1980= In 1960 Ena was in conflict with the Mission's new lay preacher Leonard Swindley (Arthur Lowe), who objected to her frequenting the Rovers. Ena collapsed due to the stress, but walked out of hospital to return to her post so that Martha Longhurst (Lynne Carol), who had taken on her responsibilities while she recovered, could not steal her job. In 1961 Ena was sacked for spreading a rumour that Coronation Street was being demolished, which turned out to be untrue. Swindley was forced to re-hire her when a suitable replacement could not be found (Ena had bribed the other candidates to turn the job down). Still unhappy with the working conditions, however, Ena walked out of the job later in the year and moved in with Minnie Caldwell (Margot Bryant), with Albert Tatlock (Jack Howarth) briefly taking on the caretaker position. She was eventually offered her job back. Ena had a health scare in 1962 when she suffered a minor stroke, brought on by hypostatic pneumonia. She quickly regained her speech and mobility, but the following year was diagnosed with arteriosclerosis. Despite her willingness to gossip Ena was very guarded about her private life, and berated Martha for discussing her health problems with Ena's daughter, Vera Lomax (Ruth Holden). Later that year Ena's great nephew, Tom Schofield (David Holliday), visited her and invited her to her brother's home in the US for an extended stay. Ena jumped at the chance to go abroad for the first time and meet the family she never knew she had. Upon her return Ena was horrified to see the Mission converted into a Community Centre, with social worker Ruth Winter (Colette O'Neil) employed there full-time. She quit upon hearing the news and moved in with Minnie at No.5. Despite being out of work, Ena was soon occupied with other problems as Vera came to stay, having separated from her husband Bob Lomax. Vera had debts to pay but not the money to pay them, so Ena gave her the money ‚Äì even though it was all her savings. A disoriented Ena was later caught accidentally stealing from a supermarket. In court Ena pleaded not guilty, but refused to give her age when questioned, saying only that she was over 21. She was subsequently fined 40/-. To offset her money problems Ena took on the job of live-in housekeeper at No.9 for Len Fairclough (Peter Adamson) although, when the Community Centre at the Mission closed down, Ena moved back into the vestry. Vera came to stay again later in 1966, claiming to be ill. Ena did not believe her until she spoke to Vera's doctor, who said that Vera had a brain tumour and had just a month to live; however Vera had not yet been told that her condition was terminal. Ena watched her daughter decline over several weeks until she died in Ena's bed in January 1967. The Mission was closed permanently a year later, when it was demolished along with the factory to make way for a block of two-storey maisonettes. Ena was offered a place at an old folk's nursing home, which she unsurprisingly declined, choosing to lodge with her old friend Henry Foster at St. Annes after briefly living with Minnie; nevertheless when the maisonettes were built Ena moved into No.6, a purpose-built OAP ground floor flat. Ena was pleased, as it occupied the exact spot where the vestry had been. In 1969 Ena became bored with the maisonette and moved into a flat above Ernest Bishop's (Stephen Hancock) camera shop. With Glad Tidings gone the closest place of worship was the Victoria Street Mission, and Ena kept close tabs on the comings and goings there. She was delighted in 1970 to meet young Tony Parsons (David Hill), who shared her passion for the harmonium. Recognising his talent Ena made him her prot√©g√© and gave him lessons, while seeing about getting him a scholarship. When the maisonettes were demolished in 1971, one of the buildings which replaced them was a community centre. Despite her age Ena was determined to secure the position of caretaker, and scared off her competitor Hetty Thorpe (Margery Withers) by warning her about the violence in the area. With no-one else to take the job, Ena was selected for the job and she moved into a flat adjacent to the Centre. Ena's age and ability to do the work was a constant concern to the Council. A co-caretaker was foisted on her (none other than Albert Tatlock), though she insisted on being called Senior Caretaker. In 1973 Ena suffered two heart attacks, but refused to move away as she wanted to die in the street. When she disappeared with the Centre keys at Christmas, preventing the children from getting any presents, Ena assumed she'd be sacked; she left to stay with Henry Foster in St. Annes, however she was allowed to keep her job. Later in the 1970s Ena alternated between Weatherfield and St. Anne's. Her friends gradually left her life ‚Äì Martha had died in 1964 and Minnie left in 1976 to live at Whaley Bridge with their old friend Handel Gartside (Harry Markham). In 1977 Councillor Tattersall (George Waring) tried to sack Ena so that his niece could take her job, but Alf Roberts (Bryan Mosley) fought on Ena's behalf. The Lomaxes offered to house Ena but she declined. In 1980 Ena dumped herself on Elsie Tanner (Pat Phoenix) and later Albert, while the flat was being re-decorated. Angered by the lack of progress that prevented her from moving back into her home, she left to stay in St. Annes, unsure about whether or not to return to Coronation Street. Ena was never seen in Weatherfield again, and all subsequent references to her were in the past tense. In 1989 Deirdre Barlow (Anne Kirkbride) said that, due to recent events in Coronation Street, ‚ÄúEna Sharples would be turning in her grave‚Äù, confirming that she had died by this time. Reception In a book written about Women and Soap Opera, Ena was described as \\"brusque and uncompromising, refusing to adjust to the changing times\\". Ena has also been described as \\"a Coronation Street prototype, a strong, bossy woman\\". In an interview Violet Carson described Ena as the eternal busybody, the rock of ages; when things are going well, she is the old bag, when things are going wrong, she is the first one they turn to\\". Actor Michael Melia has claimed in an interview that he thought the character of Ena was \\"the most forbidding face on the street. A harridan in a hair-net with a surly expression that could stop a grown man in his tracks.\\" References Category:Coronation Street characters Category:Television characters introduced in 1960 Category:Female characters in television Category:Fictional people from Manchester ","title":"Ena Sharples"},{"id":"865161","text":"Joseph Alexander Daul (born 13 April 1947) is a French politician who served as President of the European People's Party (EPP) from 2013 until 2019. He previously served as Leader of the European People's Party group in the European Parliament from 2007 to 2014 and a Member of the European Parliament (MEP) from France from 1999 until 2014. He is a member of The Republicans, part of the EPP. Daul had previously come to prominence as the chairman of the European Parliament's powerful Committee on Agriculture, a position he was elected to on 23 July 2004, and previously, from 2002, as chairman of the Conference of Committee Chairmen. He has been mayor of Pfettisheim (Bas-Rhin) since 1989, and is an officer of the Agricultural Order of Merit, knight of the National Order of Merit and knight of the Legion of Honour. In addition to French, he speaks standard German and Alsatian, the Alemannic variety of German spoken in his native Alsace.  Early life  Daul comes from a large family (six brothers and sisters) and at the age of 20 he took over a small family farm of 7 ha which he has since managed with his wife and, for the last few years, his son. While the operation has grown to 75 ha, it is still family run and specialises in beef production and the cultivation of sugar beet.  Career in national politics  Daul became active in the agricultural trade union movement, through the Centre National des Jeunes Agriculteurs (CNJA ‚Äì National Centre for Young Farmers). He completed his professional training and general education and in 1976 he was appointed national Vice-Chairman of the CNJA with responsibility for European affairs. Daul also became a member of the Committee of Professional Agricultural Organisations (COPA) and of the European Economic and Social Committee in Brussels. At the age of 35 he continued his trade union activities beyond the youth sector and combined his professional life as a farmer with positions of responsibility at a regional, (professional organisations, cooperatives, Chamber of Agriculture), national and European levels. In 1997, when the 'mad cow' crisis arose, he was chair of the National Federation of Beef Producers in France and of the 'beef' group in Europe. These activities, together with his experience as mayor of his town (1000 inhabitants) led to a more active role in politics when, in 1999, he was asked to represent the farming and rural communities on the RPR list under Nicolas Sarkozy. Daul also became deputy mayor in his home town, vice- president of the Community of Councils and chairman of the Strasbourg Abattoir Management Cooperative (160 employees).  Member of the European Parliament  After having been elected in 1999, Daul joined the then EPP-ED Group, now EPP Group. Daul became a member of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, appointed chairman in January 2002. In 2002, Daul was appointed chairman of the Conference of Committee Chairmen, which is responsible for co- ordinating 'horizontal' issues affecting the 20 parliamentary committees and for preparing the draft agenda for the plenary part-sessions. As part of the reform of the European Parliament, the Conference put forward proposals for making its work more efficient. Daul also co-chaired, together with the committee chairmen concerned, the hearings of the Commissioners and transmitted the conclusions to the President of the European Parliament. Finally, in 2005 and 2006, he and Socialist MEP Richard Corbett were Parliament's representatives for a new round of negotiations with the Council and Commission on comitology, giving Parliament, for the first time, the right to block the adoption of Commission implementing measures. The 'Lisbon Strategy' Group headed by Daul explored questions of employment and in this capacity Daul co-chaired two meetings in 2005 and 2006 between the European Parliament and the national parliaments. As a member of the European Parliament Delegation for the WTO negotiations, Daul formed part of the European Parliament delegation to the ministerial conferences in Seattle (1999), Doha (2001) and Cancun (2003). He was involved in the preparatory work for the ministerial conferences by regularly meeting ambassadors in Geneva to represent the position of the European Parliament. In January 2007, he was elected chairman of the EPP Group. He remains member of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development and substitute member of the Committee on International Trade and of the Delegation to the ACP-EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly. He is also chairman of the European Parliamentary Association (EPA). On 12 November 2013, Daul was elected president of the European People's Party, succeeding the late Wilfried Martens, while also remaining chairman of the EPP Group in the European Parliament. However, he decided not to run again in the European elections in 2014 and to leave his position as Chairman of the EPP Group in the European Parliament to dedicate all his time to his new function. He WAS re-elected as President of the EPP at the Madrid Congress in October 2015. In 2019, he was succeeded by Donald Tusk.Jones Ekblom, Ivana Sekularac and Igor Ilic (20 November 2019), EU's Tusk to lead struggling European center-right umbrella group Reuters.  Recognition  Among other honours, Daul is an \\"Officier de la L√©gion d'Honneur\\", \\"Chevalier de l'Ordre National du M√©rite\\" and \\"Officier du M√©rite Agricole\\".  Controversy  Daul was under investigation for misuse of public funds in France. He was part of an inquiry into the diversion of ‚Ç¨16 million (¬£10.6 million) of agricultural money in the 1990s that has also ensnared three former agriculture ministers. He was placed under investigation in 2004 for allegedly diverting money to finance the farmers' union, the FNSEA, and to pay his own staff. He was not accused of benefiting personally but of \\"complicity and concealment of the abuse of public funds\\". On 8 August 2007, the court had, however, asked that all charges against him be dropped, stating that the cases made against him did not require legal punishment.Affaire Unigrains ‚Äì Le parquet demande un non-lieu g√©n√©ral  Notes   External links  * Daul's website as Chairman of the EPP in the European Parliament - Category:1947 births Category:Knights of the National Order of Merit (France) Category:Living people Category:MEPs for France 1999‚Äì2004 Category:MEPs for East France 2004‚Äì2009 Category:MEPs for East France 2009‚Äì2014 Category:People from Strasbourg Category:Presidents of the European People's Party Category:Union for a Popular Movement MEPs ","title":"Joseph Daul"},{"id":"865164","text":"Side view of the main Southeastern front of Villa Farnese The Villa Farnese, also known as Villa Caprarola, is a pentagonal mansion in the town of Caprarola in the province of Viterbo, Northern Lazio, Italy, approximately 50 kilometres north-west of Rome. This villa should not be confused with the Palazzo Farnese and the Villa Farnesina, both in Rome. A property of the Republic of Italy, Villa Farnese is run by the Polo Museale del Lazio. The Villa Farnese is situated directly above the town of Caprarola and dominates its surroundings. It is a massive Renaissance and Mannerist construction, opening to the Monte Cimini, a range of densely wooded volcanic hills. It is built on a five-sided plan in reddish gold stone; buttresses support the upper floors. As a centerpiece of the vast Farnese holdings, Caprarola has always been an expression of Farnese power, rather than a villa in the more usual agricultural or pleasure senses. History Prospetto principale di Palazzo di Caprarola by Giuseppe Vasi, c. 1746‚Äì1748 In 1504, Cardinal Alessandro Farnese, the future Pope Paul III, acquired the estate at Caprarola. He had designs made for a fortified castle or rocca by the architects Antonio da Sangallo the Younger and Baldassare Peruzzi.Coffin David, The Villa in the Life of Renaissance Rome, Princeton University Press, 1979: 281-5 Surviving plan drawings by Peruzzi show a pentagonal arrangement with each face of the pentagon canted inwards towards its center, to permit raking fire upon a would-be scaling force, both from the center and from the projecting bastions that advance from each corner angle of the fortress. Peruzzi's plan also shows a central pentagonal courtyard and it is likely that the later development of the circular central court was also determined by the necessities of the pentagonal plan. The pentagonal fortress foundations, constructed probably between 1515 and 1530,Coffin, 1979: 281 became the base upon which the present villa sits; so the overall form of the villa was predetermined by the rocca foundations. Subsequently, Cardinal Alessandro Farnese, a grandson of Pope Paul III, and a man who was known for promoting his family's interests, planned to turn this partly constructed fortified edifice into a villa or country house. In 1556, he commissioned Giacomo Barozzi da Vignola as his architect,Coffin, 1979: 285 building work commenced in 1559 and Vignola continued to work on the villa at Caprarola until his death in 1573.Partridge, Loren W. \\"Vignola and the Villa Farnese at Caprarola\\", Part I The Art Bulletin 52.1 (March 1970:81-87), Part II Farnese was a courteous man of letters; however, the Farnese family as a whole became unpopular with the following pope, Julius III, and, accordingly, Alessandro Farnese decided it would be politic to retire from the Vatican for a period. He therefore selected Caprarola on the family holding of Ronciglione, being both near and yet far enough from Rome as the ideal place to build a country house. Design The Scala Regia in the Villa Farnese The villa is one of the finest examples of Renaissance architecture. Ornament is used sparingly to achieve proportion and harmony. Thus while the villa dominates the surroundings, its severe design also complements the site. This particular style, known today as Mannerism, was a reaction to the ornate earlier High Renaissance designs of twenty years earlier. Vignola, the architect chosen for this difficult and inhospitable site, had recently proved his mettle in designing Villa Giulia on the outskirts of Rome for the preceding pope, Julius III. Vignola in his youth had been heavily influenced by Michelangelo. For the villa at Caprarola, his plans as built were for a pentagon constructed around a circular colonnaded courtyard.Partridge Loren W., \\"The Farnese Circular Courtyard at Caprarola: God, Geopolitics, Genealogy, and Gender\\", The Art Bulletin 83.2 (June 2001:259-293) In the galleried court, paired Ionic columns flank niches containing busts of the Roman Emperors, above a rusticated arcade, a reworking of Bramante's scheme for the \\"House of Raphael\\", in the Borgo rione, Rome. A further Bramantesque detail is the entablature that breaks forward over the columns, linking them above, while they stand on separate bases. The interior loggia formed by the arcade is frescoed with Raphaelesque grotesques, in the manner of the Vatican Logge. The gallery and upper floors were reached by five spiral staircases around the courtyard: the most important of these is the Scala Regia (\\"Royal Stairs\\") rising through the principal floors. =Approach and entrance= The approach to the Villa Farnese is from the town's main street, which is centred on the villa, to a piazza from which stairs ascend to a series of terraces beginning with the subterranean basement excavated from the tuff, surrounded by steep curving steps leading to the terrace above. This basement floor in the foundations, which functioned as a carriage entrance in inclement weather, features a massive central column with a series of buttresses and retaining walls; on the exterior, large heavily grilled doors in the rusticated walls appear to lead into the guardrooms of a fortress, while above them a curved balustraded external double stairway leads to the terrace above. This in turn has a formal double staircase to the principal entrance on the Piano dei Prelati floor which is accessed from the broad terrace. This bastion-like floor, which appears in the elevation as a second ground floor, is rusticated, the main door a severe arch flanked by three windows on each side. The facade at this level is terminated by massive solid corner projections. Above this is the double-height piano nobile, where five huge arched windows incongruously dominate the facade over the front door; above this sit a further two floors for housing gentlefolk with servants above them, the numerous windows divided on the exterior by rusticated pilasters in dressed stone. Fasti Farnesiani ( Farnese Deeds\\") by Taddeo Zuccari, portrays Francis I of France and Charles V =Interiors= The villa's interiors are arranged over five floors, each floor designed for a different function. The main rooms are located on the first floor or piano nobile, where a large central loggia (now glazed in) looks down over the town, its main street and the surrounding countryside. This hall is known as the Room of Hercules on account of its fresco decorations,Partridge, Loren W. \\"The Sala d'Ercole in the Villa Farnese at Caprarola, Part I\\" The Art Bulletin 53.4 (December 1971:467-486), \\"Part II\\" The Art Bulletin 54.1 (March 1972:50-62). and was used as a summer dining hall. It has a grotto-like fountain with sculpture at one end. To either side of the loggia are two circular rooms: one is the chapel, the other accommodates the principal staircase or Scala Regia, a graceful spiral of steps supported by pairs of Ionic columns rising up through three floors and frescoed by Antonio Tempesta. The two grand apartments at first floor level are symmetrically-matched in plan and complete the remaining enclosure of the courtyard. Each has a series of five rooms with state rooms, which begin with the largest reception hall nearest the entrance and proceed, with increasing intimacy and decreased size, to a bedroom, wardrobe and studiolo at the northern end; an ordered suite that would become standardized in the 17th century as the Baroque state apartment. The different orientations of these two apartments allows for a seasonal differentiation; the east, or summer apartment is associated with the active life, the west, or winter range with the contemplative life.Baumgart, 1935 noted by Kish 1953:51; Coffin, 1979: 296-7. The scrupulous symmetrical balance of the two apartments is carried through by their matching parterre gardens, each reached by a bridge across the moat and cut into the hillslope. The suites are famous for their Mannerist frescoes. The iconographic program of frescoes expressing the glory of the Farnese was worked out by the humanists in Farnese's court, notably his secretary, Annibale Caro;Robertson, Clare. \\"Annibal Caro as Iconographer: Sources and Method Annibal Caro as Iconographer: Sources and Method\\" Journal of the Warburg and Courtauld Institutes 45 (1982:160-181); see also Baumgart, Fritz. \\"La Caprarola di Ameto Orti\\", Studi Romanzi, 25 (1935:80); in 240 Latin verses, La Caprarola of Ameto Orti (c 1585-89) describes the beauties of the Farnese castello. The fresco cycles portray the exploits of Alexander the Great, and of course of the Farnese themselves: in the Sala dei Fasti Farnesiani (the Room of Farnese Deeds), decorated by the brothers Taddeo and Federico Zuccari, the Farnese are depicted at all their most glorious moments, from floor to coffered ceiling.Partridge, Loren W. \\"Divinity and Dynasty at Caprarola: Perfect History in the Room of Farnese Deeds\\", The Art Bulletin 60.3 (September 1978:494-530). Other artists employed in fresco decoration include Giacomo Zanguidi (il Bertoia), Raffaellino da Reggio, Antonio Tempesta, Giacomo del Duca, and Giovanni De Vecchi. The Flemish painters Joos van Winghe and Bartholomaeus Spranger assisted il Bertoia with the decorations in the rooms he had been commissioned to finish.V√©ronique B√ºcken, \\"Deux flamands dans l‚Äôatelier de Jacopo Bertoja: Joos van Winghe et Bartholomaeus Spranger\\", in: Jadranka Bertini (red.), Lelio Orsi e la cultura del suo tempo. Atti del convegno internazionale di studi, Reggio Emilia ‚Äì Novellara 1988, Bologna, 1990, pp. 49‚Äì56 Among the frescoed subjects of the contemplative winter suite is the famous \\"Room of the World Map\\" or Sala del Mappamondo, displaying the whole known world as it was in 1574 when the frescoes were completed.Kish, G. \\" 'The Mural Atlas' of Caprarola\\" Imago Mundi 10 (1953:51-56); the date 1574 is worked into the border of the map of Europe (p. 53); Kish identifies the sources in contemporary printed maps; the ideology of status, service, and personal merit behind the presentation of maps was interpreted by Partridge, Loren W. \\"The Room of Maps at Caprarola, 1573-75\\" The Art Bulletin, 77.3 (September 1995:413-444); the frescoes are revisited by Quinlan-McGrath, Mary. \\"Caprarola's Sala della Cosmografi\\", Renaissance Quarterly 50.4 (Winter 1997:1045-1100). Above, the frescoed vault depicts the celestial spheres and the constellations of the zodiac. =Gardens= The gardens of the villa are as impressive as the building itself, a significant example of the Italian Renaissance garden period. The villa's fortress theme is carried through by a surrounding moat and three drawbridges. Two facades of the pentagonal arrangement face the two gardens cut into the hill; each garden is accessed across the moat by a drawbridge from the apartments on the piano nobile and each is a parterre garden of box topiary with fountains. A grotto- like theatre was once here. A walk through the chestnut woods beyond, leads to the giardino segreto, or secret garden, with its well-known casino. The Casino The Casino, a small habitable summerhouse with two loggie for al fresco dining. It was built probably on designs by Giacomo del Duca, with later alterations were made to the area around the casino by the architect Girolamo Rainaldi.Coffin, 1979: 302 although later alterations were made to the area around the casino by the architect Girolamo Rainaldi. The casino is approached by stairs contained between heavily rusticated grotto walls, with a central catena d'acqua, a cascaded rill or 'water-staircase', which the water flows down to a stone basin. At the top of the steps and set in an oval space are large statues of two reclining river gods to either side of a large central vase fountain. Stairs built into the oval walls lead up to the parterred terrace in front of the south facade of the casino. This part of the terrace is lined by stone herms with cypress trees. To the north of the casino is a private garden which steps up slightly and accommodates roses. Today Alessandro Farnese died in 1589 bequeathing his estates to relations - the Farnese dukes of Parma. The Cardinal's fabulous collection was transferred eventually to Charles III of Spain in Naples. In the 19th century the villa became for a while the residence of the heir to the throne of the newly united Italy. Elements of the villa's Renaissance gardens have influenced many estate gardens of the 19th and 20th century by landscape designers, such as Beatrix Farrand, A.E. Hanson, and Florence Yoch. 1920s gardens with a catena d'acqua include the Harold Lloyd Estate in Beverly Hills and 'Las Tejas' in Montecito, California, with the latter also having a casino in direct homage to the original at Villa Farnese.Streatfield, David. \\"California Gardens: Creating a New Eden.\\" Abbeville Press. New York, London, Paris. 1994. . pp. 127. 107-11. Today the casino and its gardens are one of the homes of the President of the Italian Republic. The empty main villa, owned by the State, is open to the public. The numerous rooms, salons and halls with their marbles and frescoes, and the architecture of the great palazzo-like villa are still as impressive and daunting as they were first intended to be.

He served as the first chancellor of the University of Warwick from its foundation in 1965 to 1977. Background, education and early career Radcliffe was born in Llanychan, Denbighshire, Wales, the son of an army captain. His maternal grandfather was President of the Law Society between 1890 and 1891. Radcliffe was educated at Haileybury College. He was then conscripted in World War I but his poor eyesight limited the options for service so he was allocated to the Labour Corps. After the War, he attended New College, Oxford as a scholar, and took a first in literae humaniores in 1921. In 1922 he was elected to a prize fellowship at All Souls College, Oxford. He won the Eldon Law Scholarship in 1923. He was called to the bar by the Inner Temple in 1924, and joined the chambers of Wilfred Greene, later the Master of the Rolls. He practised at the Chancery bar, and was appointed a King's Counsel in 1935. During World War II, Radcliffe joined the Ministry of Information becoming its Director-General by 1941, where he worked closely with the Minister Brendan Bracken. In 1944 he was made a Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire (KBE). He returned to the bar in 1945. Indian Boundary Committees Radcliffe, a man who had never been east of Paris, was given the chairmanship of the two boundary committees set up with the passing of the Indian Independence Act. He was faced with the daunting task of drawing the borders for the new nations of Pakistan and India in a way that would leave as many Hindus and Sikhs in India and Muslims in Pakistan as possible. Radcliffe submitted his partition map on 9 August 1947, which split Punjab and Bengal almost in half. The new boundaries were formally announced on 14 August 1947 ‚Äì the day of Pakistan's independence and the day before India became independent of the United Kingdom. Radcliffe's efforts saw some 14 million people ‚Äì roughly seven million from each side ‚Äì flee across the border when they discovered the new boundaries left them in the \\"wrong\\" country. In the violence that ensued after independence, estimates of loss of life accompanying or preceding the partition vary between several hundred thousand and two million, and millions more were injured. After seeing the mayhem occurring on both sides of the boundary, Radcliffe refused his salary of 40,000 rupees (then 3,000 pounds). He was made a Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the British Empire in 1948. The poet W. H. Auden referred to Radcliffe's role in the partition of India and Pakistan in his 1966 poem \\"Partition\\". Later career In 1949, Radcliffe was made a Lord of Appeal in Ordinary, sworn of the Privy Council, and created a life peer as Baron Radcliffe, of Werneth in the County of Lancaster. Unusually, he had not previously been a judge. In the 1940s and 1950s he chaired a string of public enquiries in addition to his legal duties and continued to hold numerous trusteeships, governorships and chairmanships right up until his death. He chaired the Committee of Enquiry into the Future of the British Film Institute (1948), whose recommendations led to the modernisation of the BFI in the post- war period. From 1957 he was chairman of the Radcliffe Committee, called to enquire into the working of the monetary and credit system. The committee published a report known as the Radcliffe report which suggested reforms on how monetary policy is run. He was also a frequent public speaker and wrote numerous books: he gave the BBC Reith Lecture in 1951 ‚Äì a series of seven broadcasts titled Power and the State which examined the features of democratic society, and considered the problematic notions of power and authority. He also presented the Oxford University Romanes Lecture in 1963 on Mountstuart Elphinstone. In 1962 he was made a hereditary peer as Viscount Radcliffe, of Hampton Lucy in the County of Warwick. Personal life Lord Radcliffe married Antonia Mary Roby, daughter of Godfrey Benson, 1st Baron Charnwood and former wife of John Tennant, in 1939. He died in April 1977, aged 78. He had no issue and the viscountcy of Radcliffe became extinct on his death. In 2006, two sets of Chancery barristers' chambers in Lincoln's Inn merged and adopted the name \\"Radcliffe Chambers\\" in his honour.

History Named after the 18th century conservative philosopher Edmund Burke, the Edmund Burke Foundation was founded in 2000 by a group of young conservatives, including professor Andreas Kinneging and journalist Bart Jan Spruyt, unsatisfied with the consensus of Dutch politics, the level of public debate and what they believe is the dangerous drift of philosophy and culture in the Netherlands. From 2000 to 2005, the Foundation was active as both a think-tank and an educational group. In that time, the foundation took positions that are both fiscally and socially conservative. It organized an annual summer school for undergraduate students, conferences, seminars and lectures on topics such as the multicultural society, education, health care, foreign policy and defense. Conservatives associated with the Foundation were, for example, in favor of health care privatization and tax cuts. The Foundation has links with conservative thinktanks in the US, such as the Heritage Foundation and the American Enterprise Institute. Speakers at the foundation's events included Roger Scruton, the Burke scholar Peter Stanlis, Dutch writer Leon de Winter, Islam-expert Reuel Marc Gerecht, Frits Bolkestein and Onno Ruding, former finance minister of The Netherlands. In the summer of 2005, the Board of the Foundation decided to focus its activities more exclusively on its educational, cultural and philosophical programs, taking the Intercollegiate Studies Institute explicitly as a role model. Consequently, Bart Jan Spruyt stepped back as full-time managing director of the think-tank to join the political party of Geert Wilders, but remained a member of the governing Board of the Foundation. Several former employees then spun off the think-tank activities into a new group called the European Independent Institute. Media activities In its think tank period, the Burke Foundation regularly published reports and studies on a variety of topics, including the Dutch health care sector, privatization, wasteful government spending and conservative philosophy and thought. Members of the Burke Foundation published articles and op-eds in numerous newspapers, and many newspapers devoted substantial attention to the activities of the Foundation. Those newspapers include De Telegraaf, de Volkskrant, NRC Handelsblad, Het Parool, Trouw, Nederlands Dagblad, and weekly magazines such as HP/De Tijd, Elsevier, and De Groene Amsterdammer. Members of the Burke Foundation also appeared regularly on TV and Radio programs, including NOVA, Den Haag Vandaag, TweeVandaag, and the Radio 1 News program. Funding The Foundation received substantial support during its think-tank period from a variety of sources, including small private donors, Dutch entrepreneurs, and various multinational corporations, such as Pfizer and Microsoft.

Reduction is performed by simmering or boiling a liquid such as a stock, fruit or vegetable juices, wine, vinegar, or a sauce until the desired concentration is reached by evaporation. This is done without a lid, enabling the vapor to escape from the mixture. Different components of the liquid will evaporate at slightly different temperatures, and the goal of reduction is to drive away those with lowest points of evaporation. While reduction does concentrate the flavors left in the pan, reducing too much will drive away all liquid in the sauce, leaving a \\"sticky, burnt coating\\" on the pan. Sauces from basic brown sauce to B√©chamel sauce and even tomato sauce are simmered for long periods (from 1 to 10 hours) but not boiled. Simmering not only develops the maximum possible flavor, but also allows impurities to collect at the top and be skimmed off periodically as the sauce cooks. Boiling diffuses the impurities into the liquid and results in a bitter taste and unclear stock. Broths are also simmered rather than boiled, and for the same reasons.

Its nine members, the Priori, were chosen from the ranks of the guilds of the city: six of them from the major guilds, and two from the minor guilds. The ninth became the Gonfaloniere of Justice. Selection of members The names of all guild members over thirty years old were put in eight leather bags called borse. Every two months, these bags were taken from the church of Santa Croce, where they were ordinarily kept, and in a short ceremony drawn out at random. Only men who were not in debt, had not served a recent term, and had no relation to the names of men already drawn, would be considered eligible for office. Service in the Signoria Immediately after they were elected, the nine were expected to move into the Palazzo della Signoria, where they would remain for the two months of their office. There they were paid a modest sum to cover their expenses and were provided with green-liveried servants. The Priori had a uniform of crimson coats, lined with ermine and with ermine collars and cuffs. In undertaking their governmental duties, the Signoria was required to consult two other elected councils collectively known as Collegi.

A water polo ball is a ball used in water polo and canoe polo, usually characterized by a bright yellow color and ease of grip ability, so as to allow it to be held with one hand despite its large size. Standard water polo ball characteristics Ball weight is 400-450 grams (14-16 ounces) and inflated to 90-97 kPa (kilopascals) gauge pressure (13-14 psi) for men and 83-90 kPa (12-13 psi) for women.FINA Water Polo Rules: Section 3, The BallCanoe Polo Competition Rules Water polo balls come in two main sizes: a size 5 (68-71 cm in circumference), intended for use by men, and a size 4 (65-67 cm in circumference), intended for women. Smaller balls are sometimes used by juniors for \\"mini-polo,\\" though these miniature balls do not typically come in standard sizes and are often coloured green. Development of the water polo ball The modern game originated in the late 19th century as a form of rugby football, played in rivers in England and Scotland, with a small 3 to 4 inch ball constructed of rubber imported from colonial plantations in India. This \\"water rugby\\" came to be called \\"water polo\\" based on the English pronunciation of the Balti word for ball, pulu. The original ball soon gave way to a football (soccer ball), which allowed for passing and swimming above water with the ball. However, the leather football absorbed water and became extremely heavy, slippery and out- of-control when wet. In 1936, James R. (\\"Jimmy\\") Smith, California water polo coach and author of several books on water polo mechanics, developed a ball made with an inflatable bladder and a rubber fabric cover, which improved performance.International Swimming Hall of Fame, Biography: Jimmy Smith Retrieved December 17, 2006 The new ball was red, but by 1948 yellow was adopted for better visibility by players. It became the official FINA and Olympic ball in 1956. Recent changes to water polo balls A new style of water polo ball introduced in 2005 In the first half of 2005, FINA allowed a change to the standard water polo ball used in official games. This change permitted a coloured middle stripe (blue, green, red, black, or yellow) with the normal yellow stripes flanking the coloured. In May 2006, the NCAA and National Federation of State High School Associations Rules Committees announced a rule change allowing the colored balls to be used in all NCAA and NFHS sanctioned games.USA Water Polo: NCAA and NFHS Make Rule Change to Allow Colored Water Polo Balls Retrieved December 17, 2006 The current rule states that the water polo ball must be ‚Äúyellow with black lines,‚Äù but new wording will allow for colored panels. Mikasa Sports, manufacturer of the new colored ball, claims that the new ball benefits teams by making it easier for them to keep track of their balls, differentiating the women‚Äôs balls from the men‚Äôs and teaching proper rotation on the ball.

The grey stripe corresponds to œÅs0 = (110 ¬± 60) œÉdc Tc (the units are the same as those in the original Nature paper). In superconductivity, Homes's law is an empirical relation that states that a superconductor's critical temperature (Tc) is proportional to the strength of the superconducting state for temperatures well below Tc close to zero temperature (also referred to as the fully formed superfluid density, \\\\rho_{s0}) multiplied by the electrical resistivity \\\\rho_{dc} measured just above the critical temperature. In cuprate high-temperature superconductors the relation follows the form \\\\rho_{dc}^\\\\alpha\\\\,\\\\rho_{s0}^\\\\alpha/8 \\\\simeq 4.4\\\\,T_c , or alternatively \\\\rho_{s0}^\\\\alpha/8 \\\\simeq 4.4\\\\,\\\\sigma_{dc}^\\\\alpha\\\\, T_c. Many novel superconductors are anisotropic, so the resistivity and the superfluid density are tensor quantities; the superscript \\\\alpha denotes the crystallographic direction along which these quantities are measured. Note that this expression assumes that the conductivity and temperature have both been recast in units of cm‚àí1 (or s‚àí1), and that the superfluid density has units of cm‚àí2 (or s‚àí2); the constant is dimensionless. The expected form for a BCS dirty-limit superconductor has slightly larger numerical constant of ~8.1. The law is named for physicist Christopher Homes and was first presented in the July 29, 2004 edition of Nature, and was the subject of a News and Views article by Jan Zaanen in the same issue in which he speculated that the high transition temperatures observed in the cuprate superconductors are because the metallic states in these materials are as viscous as permitted by the laws of quantum physics. A more detailed version of this scaling relation subsequently appeared in Physical Review B in 2005, in which it was argued that any material that falls on the scaling line is likely in the dirty limit (superconducting coherence length Œæ0 is much greater than the normal-state mean-free path l, Œæ0‚â´ l); however, a paper by Vladimir Kogan in Physical Review B in 2013 has shown that the scaling relation is valid even when Œæ0~ l, suggesting that only materials in the clean limit (Œæ0‚â™ l) will fall off of this scaling line. Francis Pratt and Stephen Blundell have argued that Homes's law is violated in the organic superconductors. This work was first presented in Physical Review Letters in March 2005. On the other hand, it has been recently demonstrated by Sasa Dordevic and coworkers that if the dc conductivity and the superfluid density are measured on the same sample at the same time using either infrared or microwave impedance spectroscopy, then the organic superconductors do indeed fall on the universal scaling line, along with a number of other exotic superconductors. This work was published in Scientific Reports in 2013.

It is similar to SimCity, in that the game involves successfully developing a town into a larger metropolis; however, the focus is more on the ability of the citizens to use transportation to get around the area (hence the name). Very fine control of traffic flow is given to the player -- details all the way down to speed limits and right-of-way at intersections are options that can be selected in-game. Due to Mobility's focus on getting around, most of the structures that can be built are dedicated to transportation, such as bus stops, parking decks, and train stations, although there are other basic gameplay items such as zones. The current Microsoft Windows version is 3.02, released on 26 October 2012. The Linux version is still limited to 2.00. It is released as shareware, available on the Mobility Web site.

The band formed in 2000 with members vocalist Mark Chavez, guitarist Tim Fluckey, guitarist Mike Ransom, bassist Dave DeRoo, and drummer Kris Kohls. After their first two albums, Adema, and Unstable, the band was plagued with years of conflict and lineup changes. Ransom left the band in 2003 followed by Chavez later in 2004 due to conflicts between themselves and other members of the band. Luke Caraccioli replaced Chavez in early 2005 for one album, Planets, but then left a few months later in late 2005. Vocalist Bobby Reeves and guitarist Ed Farris, both from the band Level, were recruited to join as well, but only released one album, Kill the Headlights in 2007, before entering a hiatus. The band's original line up reformed in late 2009 and toured, but both Ransom and Chavez left again before any new music would be recorded. Fluckey took over lead vocals from 2011 to 2017. The lineup released an EP, Topple the Giants. In 2013 Ransom returned once again; Chavez rejoined the band again in March 2017, only to leave again in 2019. He was replaced by Ryan Shuck History =2000‚Äì2002: Formation and self-titled release= Before Adema, lead vocalist Mark Chavez, half-brother of Korn's lead vocalist, Jonathan Davis, played guitar for B.P.D. (Big, Powerful, and Dangerous), guitarist Tim Fluckey formerly played with Juice along with bassist Dave DeRoo, who previously played with Sexart along with Orgy guitarist Ryan Shuck and Jonathan Davis, guitarist Mike Ransom formerly played saxophone of Ska band Mento Buru, and drummer Kris Kohls formerly played with Cradle of Thorns. The band's eponymous debut album, Adema, was released in August 2001 to moderate success. Its two major singles, \\"Giving In\\" and \\"The Way You Like It,\\" received significant airplay on rock radio. All of the lyrics were written by Chavez, and the album was produced by Bill Appleberry (7th House) and Tobi Miller (The Wallflowers guitarist). Adema's eponymous debut album was certified gold, and the band received a spot on the main stage during the Ozzfest tour. They kept playing live with the Music as a Weapon, SnoCore Rock, and Projekt Revolution tours. In 2002, Adema released Insomniac's Dream, an EP, as a \\"gift to fans.\\" The single from the album, \\"Immortal,\\" was written for the video game Mortal Kombat: Deadly Alliance. Besides the single, it included a track from international versions of Adema, a cover to Alice in Chains's \\"Nutshell\\", and four remix versions of songs from Adema. 2002 also marked Adema's inclusion in the Resident Evil Soundtrack, contributing the track \\"Everyone\\" from their debut album. =2003‚Äì2004: Unstable and lineup changes= Adema's second album, Unstable, was released by Arista in August 2003. It was produced by Howard Benson, whose credits also include producing albums with P.O.D., Hoobastank and Cold. The band has vigorously fought the label \\"nu metal,\\" preferring to be classified as traditional rock. While Unstable was not a significant break from their earlier sound, Chavez compared it to the rawness of Nirvana, and bassist DeRoo hoped that Chavez's stronger voice (the result of voice lessons) would result in a more mainstream sound. \\"We don't go onstage and nu metal,\\" said drummer Kohls. \\"We're sick of that phrase. ROCK ‚Äì it's such a broad word that it doesn't categorize you.\\" Chavez and guitarist Ransom had a bitter rivalry that ended when first Ransom, then Chavez, left the band. The rest of the band has blamed Chavez for \\"personal problems\\" that held the band back musically, but Chavez claimed that it was differences in the direction of the music. The feud with Ransom put the rest of the band in the middle. While DeRoo wouldn't comment specifically on what the supposed problems were, he insinuated that Chavez was caught up in drugs. During 2003, when the band released and toured for Unstable, Chavez and Ransom didn't speak to one another. The band claimed that the split was no surprise. Ransom left in December, while the remaining four members finished touring. Amidst this conflict, Unstable sold over 66% less than the band's debut album. In December, the band learned that Arista was dropping them during a label merger. A large number of Arista's staff was fired in a management shakeup by its parent company, Sony. L.A. Reid, who originally signed the band, had left the label a week earlier. The band has blamed low sales of Unstable on being dropped. The band continued to write, but in February 2004, Chavez started to lose interest. He quit the band in September. Note on sales figures: These numbers come from Nielsen SoundScan, from September 2004. These sales figures appear to have stabilized. While the remaining three members remained on good terms with Ransom, their attitude towards Chavez was much less favorable. With regards to the split with Adema, Adema blamed the split on Chavez's disinterest in the band. However, Chavez acknowledged personal problems and claimed that \\"it takes two to tango,\\" and that his decision precipitated from an argument with drummer Kohls over the direction of the band. Chavez would form the band Midnight Panic with his cousin and old bandmates Cesareo Garasa and Mike Montano, which released the self-titled Midnight Panic EP before dissolving. =2004‚Äì2005: Planets with Luke Caraccioli= The remaining three Adema members regrouped to write new music and auditioned for a new lead singer. After Kohls heard a demo from Rewind Yesterday, another Bakersfield band, he was impressed by the group's lead singer, Luke Caraccioli. Adema asked Caraccioli to front the band. Luke Caraccioli accepted a few months later in January 2005. Adema signed to metal label Earache Records in Spring 2004 when its manager, Al Dawson, heard them at a show. Under their new label, the band gained more control over their direction than they had when signed with Arista. Adema lauded Earache for allowing \\"bands to express themselves creatively.\\" On April 5, 2005, the band would deliver their next album, Planets produced by Nick Forcillo. They released the album's first single, \\"Tornado,\\" back on February 18, 2005. Planets, as an album, was musically, a significant break from Adema's two earlier albums; it was much closer to rock than Adema's nu metal history. In comparison to the previous albums, which featured heavy usages of programming and synthesizers, 'Planets' features stronger piano melodies and guitar-drive harmonics. g Kohls said that the band relied on influences from classic rock. and that the band proved that they were \\"so much more than\\" a nu metal band. The writing for the album was shared between the four members with Tim recording all of the guitar portions of the album. As a former marine, Caraccioli played his first show with Adema in the Persian Gulf in April 2005. They performed for American troops stationed in Iraq, Afghanistan, Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates for the Armed Forces Entertainment. Though the Iraq War was still raging, the band stressed that the tour was apolitical. Adema then promoted the release by touring with Brides of Destruction, a band that Kohls had briefly been involved in. Though proud of their identity change, the band noted that they had a mixture of fans from both the \\"old\\" and \\"new\\" Adema at live shows. In September of that year, the band released a second single from the album, \\"Planets.\\" The music video for the single was featured in the film, Cry Wolf. In October 2005, after only 10 months, Luke Caraccioli left the band, citing personal reasons. Following his departure, the band got in touch with Mark Chavez and according to the band, both parties were back on good terms. Both parties even had talks about Chavez singing for Adema again and even wrote some new songs together, nothing transpired from these events until August 2009. =2006‚Äì2008: Kill The Headlights with Bobby Reeves and hiatus= In March 2006, Adema announced a new vocalist, Bobby Reeves, a former member of the band LEVEL. In August, the band recruited guitarist Ed Faris, also a former member of LEVEL. With their new lineup, the band signed onto Immortal Records in February 2007. They released Kill the Headlights, produced by Marshall Altman (Marc Broussard, Zebrahead) in August 2007. The first single, \\"Cold and Jaded,\\" was released in July. In early 2008 Dave Deroo announced the band has decided to go on a \\"hiatus\\" to regroup, take a break, and assured fans they have not broken up. =2009‚Äì2011: Reunion and departure of original lineup= On August 13, 2009, Mark Chavez posted a blog on his official Myspace page stating that he has returned to Adema. He also plans for the band to write an album and begin touring before the release of said album. The blog read: It was later confirmed that both Mark Chavez and original guitarist Mike Ransom were back in the band. A second blog from the band's Myspace stated that both Bobby Reeves and Ed Faris had agreed to leave the band and that this was the right thing to do for Adema and their fans, the blog went on to say, \\"This SURE won't be the last you see of Bobby or Ed, and we wanted to take the time to thank them for their service in the line of duty...\\" Adema announced on their official Twitter page that the first rehearsal with the original lineup in 6 years took place November 15, 2009. The original members of Adema played their first show together in over 5 years on January 14, 2010, at Whisky A Go Go in West Hollywood. A full 2010 tour list across the United States has also been posted on the band's Myspace and Facebook page and new material was announced to be released around February 2011. The band went on their 2010 tour. However, Mike Ransom was unable to join them due to his commitments with recording an album with his band, Black Heart Vacancy. He left once again in November. Mark Chavez abruptly left Adema once again before the start of the 2011 tour to pursue his solo project. Guitarist Tim Fluckey and Bassist David DeRoo have since taken over vocal duties. The reason behind Chavez's departure was that he had another conflict with the band. Chavez brought his wife with him on the band's 2010 tour. When the band didn't let her on the 2011 tour, he reportedly told the other members, \\"Alright, if you think you can do this without me, you go right ahead.\\" In January 2011, bassist David DeRoo was arrested just prior to performing a concert in Connecticut, and was charged with being a fugitive of the law. A warrant for his arrest was issued in July 2010 for violating his probation issued from a prior DUI incident in November 2008. DeRoo's bond was set at US$1 million. Being contractually obligated to fulfill their already scheduled 2011 tour dates, Tim Fluckey, Kris Kohls and touring fill-in and the Mentors lead vocalist and drummer Marc DeLeon performed as Adema in the absence of DeRoo. =2011‚Äì2013: Topple the Giants= On their official Facebook page, the band announced on July 19, 2011, \\"We're going in the studio this week! New music coming soon!\\". Since then they had also announced a new EP, \\"Topple the Giants\\", available for download in February 2012 along with a special edition disc in March. It included new songs along with old songs re-recorded with the current line-up. A full-length album was announced to be released later in summer 2012. However, on May 22, 2012, they announced that their new EP \\"that was slated for release on all digital formats today has been delayed until further notice.\\" After finally signing a deal with Pavement Entertainment in early 2013, the band had announced they would release Topple the Giants on the release date of April 2, 2013. Many have called the cover one of the worst metal album covers of all time. =2013‚Äì17: Mike Ransom's second return= On September 13, 2013, it was announced by Dave DeRoo that Mike Ransom had returned to the band once again. =2017‚Äìpresent: Mark Chavez's third tenure and tour with Ryan Shuck= On March 27, 2017, Mark Chavez was seen rehearsing with original members of Adema, signifying his return to band. They performed with him at the Whisky A Go Go on May 24, 2017, his first show with the band in six years. The band later confirmed that they were working on a new album. Following their last shows in December of that year, no news emerged until June 2019, when it was announced that Chavez had departed again.

The main economic activity is farming with large bacon and processed food factories situated around the town. The N3 freeway passes close to the town, linking it to the rest of South Africa. Location Estcourt is located at the confluence of the Bushmans and the Little Bushmans River. It is also on the main Durban - Johannesburg railway line some 160 km north of Durban and 25 km south of the Tugela River crossing. In earlier years the main road, later to become the N3, passed through the town. The town itself is 1196 m above sea level and lies in the hilly country that dominates most of the Natal Midlands. The Drakensberg lies some 41 km to the west of the town. The Nineteenth Century The earliest identifiable inhabitants of the Estcourt area were the bushmen, a hunter-gather people, though rock engravings dating from four different Iron Age periods have been found on the farm Hattingsvlakte. The bushmen had been displaced by the Bantu people, a pastoral people and in particular the Zulu, a tribe that traced its origins as a separate nation to the early eighteenth century. The bushmen had sought sanctuary in the foothills of the Drakensberg. In the early nineteenth century the Zulu king Shaka used the weapon of Mfecane (genocide) to build his empire. Thus, when the white settlers first arrived in the Estcourt area, the land appeared to be almost uninhabited.Bulpin, T.V. Natal and the Zulu Country, T.V.Bulpin Publications Ltd., Cape Town, 1966 =The First Settlers= The first recorded settlement in the Estcourt area was in 1838 when a group of Voortrekkers encamped on the banks of the Bushmans River in anticipation of securing land right from Dingane kaSenzangakhona, the Zulu king. The negotiator, Piet Retief, and his party were murdered by Dingane on 6 February 1838 and on 17 February attacks, since known as the Weenen massacre, were launched on the Voortrekker encampments along the Bloukrans River, the Bushmans River and the Mooi River. After a Voortrekker retaliation at the Battle of Blood River, Dingane was deposed and his place taken by Mpande. Panda seceded the land south of the Tugela River to the settlers which included the area that was to become Estcourt. The Voortrekkers set up the Natalia Republic, but after the Battle of Congella in 1842, they abandoned their settlements and moved into the interior, leaving Natalia to the British who established the Colony of Natal. Thus Natal acquired an English-speaking rather than an Afrikaans-speaking settler community and Estcourt, being so close to the Tugela River become a frontier outpost. In 1847 Clem Heeley was the owner of an inn and trading store at a ford on the Bushman's River. On 4 December that year a military post known as Bushman's River Post was established on a hill dominating the ford, whilst at the same time a village known as Bushman's River was established across the river.Pearce, RO - Sable and Murray - The story of Estcourt High School, The Natal Witness, Pietermaritzburg, 1946 On 4 January 1848 the Surveyor General recommended that the seat for the new magisterial district of Impofane be located at Bushmans River Drift. Initially the recommendation was ignored and the magistracy was located at Weenen, some 30 km away but in 1859, with the growing importance of Estcourt, the seat was moved there. =The Byrne Settlers and the Name \\"Estcourt\\"= The settler community was further strengthened by the arrival of the Byrne Settlers - English immigrants whose settlement in the Colony was sponsored by Thomas Estcourt, a North Wiltshire, MP. In 1946 there appears have been conflicting suggestions of why the town was called \\"Estcourt\\" - one body of opinion favouring the view that the town was named after Captain Estcourt, a member of the party who established the military outpost in 1847 and the other favouring the view that the town was named after Thomas Estcourt MP in 1863. Pearce, after extensive research which was backed up by the Ralfe family legend, supported the latter view which is now the accepted view. =The Settlement Grows= In 1872 an Anglican church was built on the banks of the Bushman's River, and Fort Durnford was built in 1874 by Lt-Col Durnford, a military engineer, as a base for the Natal Mounted Police. The fort became a substantial stronghold, and was used to protect transport riders and the herds of cattle driven across the ford. It is as secure as any castle with drinking water tanks in the basement, a drawbridge, moat and two secret tunnels. The confirmation of large deposits of coal in the Dundee area in 1880, some 100 km north of Estcourt led to the building of a railway line to link the coalfields with Durban. In 1885 the railway reached Estcourt and a bridge that is still in use today was built across the Bushman's River. The completion of the line to the coalfields the following year provided Estcourt with a good communications link to the coast. After a number of attempts to establish private schools had failed due to lack of support, the town's first government school, the Estcourt Government School was established in 1886 with an initial role of 45 children. In accordance with the prevailing colonial policy, the school only admitted pupils of European descent. In 1895, the traveller Ingram described Estcourt as having \\" ... buildings [that] are strong and substantial, being for the most part constructed of hewn stone. A fort crowns the hill to the southward. There are in the town three churches, four hotels, and at the station a railway bar, A commodious sanatorium in connection with the Roman Catholic Mission has recently been established near the town. The population is put down at about 300 residents, though on market days, quite a large throng of farmers are to be met in its streets.\\" The mission station itself had been opened in 1892 - the second Augustinian Sisters establishment in Natal staffed mainly by French-speaking nuns from Canada and France. The mission had a school, sanatorium and a chapel for the Roman Catholic families in the town. The sanatorium was well used during the period when the railway line was being constructed and during the Boer War. Due to an economic depression after the war the school was unable to survive and the sanatorium had to complete with a nursing home that was run by one of the two doctors in the town. Changing attitudes after Vatican II and the opening of hospitals run by the Provincial Departments contributed to the order closing its mission and the sanatorium in Estcourt in the late 1960s. In 1899, when he arrived at Estcourt as a war correspondent, Churchill described the town as \\"a South African town‚Äîthat is to say, it is a collection of about three hundred detached stone or corrugated iron houses, nearly all one- storied, arranged along two broad streets‚Äîfor space is plentiful‚Äîor straggling away towards the country\\". =The Boer War= When the Anglo-Boer War broke out on 10 October 1899, the Boer forces had 21,000 men ready to invade the Colony of Natal. Ranged against them, the British had 13,000 men. The Boers under the command of General Petrus Joubert crossed the border into the Natal Colony and rapidly advanced to the Tugela river, laying siege to Ladysmith, some 40 km north of the river and entrapping some 8,000 British regulars.Meredith M, Diamonds, Gold and War - The Making of South Africa; Chapter 39, Pocket Books, London 2007 Estcourt effectively became the front and this is where General Sir Redvers Buller first established his Natal headquarters and where Winston Churchill, then a war correspondent based himself. On 15 November a raiding party ambushed an armoured train at Frere, 20 km north of Estcourt taking 70 prisoners including Churchill.Symons, J - Buller's Campaign - Cresset, London 1963 After another raiding party was surprised on 23 November at Willow Grange, 10 km to the south of Estcourt, the Boers withdrew to a position behind the Tugela River. British reinforcements arrived and once Ladysmith was relieved on 1 March 1900, formal Boer opposition melted away and the colony was secured. The Twentieth Century As the twentieth century dawned, Estcourt's position as a communications hub was enhanced by the building of the Estcourt - Weenen railway line in 1907 to enable agricultural produce from Weenen to reach the main cities. (This line was closed in 1983). =Municipal Development= Estcourt became a municipality in 1914. The Augustinian Order of Natal, having been present in the town since the 1890s built a chapel in 1929. In the last census of the century, taken in 1991, the population of Esctourt was recorded as being approximately 3 407 whites, 710 coloureds, 5 432 Asians and 1 296 blacks. =Industrial development= During the twentieth century, Estcourt developed from being a market town serving the local farming community to one in which the products from the farming community were used in the manufacture of consumer products. At some time close to the start of the twentieth century, Joseph Baynes, a Byrne settler and dairy industry pioneer, established a milk processing plant in Estcourt under the name of the Natal Creamery Ltd. Baynesfield Museum This factory was located adjacent to the railway station. Baynes died in 1925 and in 1927 the factory, which by this time was owned by South African Condensed Milk Ltd. was bought by Nestl√©. Today the factory produces Coffee, MILO and NESQUIK.Nestl√©s S.A. Home Page In August 1917 the Farmer's Co-operative Bacon Factory Limited was founded and the building of the factory commenced. The factory was opened on 6 June 1918 by the Prime Minister General Louis Botha and marketed its products under the brand name Eskort. In August 1920, the company secured the services of Mr. H.W. Lambert of Scotland as 'sausage maker', thereby starting a tradition for quality sausages whose reputation has since become world famous. The following year the factory commenced exports to the United Kingdom and during the Second World War supplied over one million tins of sausages to the Allied forces all over the world and over 12 tonnes of bacon weekly to convoys calling at Durban harbour. A sister plant was built in Heidelberg and in 1967 the Eskort brand was the largest processed meat brand in South Africa. In 1998 the company was converted from a cooperative to a limited liability company.Eskort Limited Home Page 1948 saw the establishment of the Masonite factory in Estcourt. Masonite was a hardboard product developed in the United States in 1924 by William H. Mason. The mill is in Estcourt, but its headquarters are in Durban and uses timber harvested from 21 922 ha of productive commercial plantations owned by the company. The mill currently employs 900 people and chips 600 logs a day.Masonite Home Page In 1963 the 58.5 million cubic metre Wagendrift Dam was constructed on the Bushman's River some 2 km upstream from the town of Estcourt. The dam was designed to irrigate 3,000 ha of land that lay upstream from the river's confluence with the Tugela River. =Education= At the turn of the century, the Estcourt Government School had about 100 children and offered formal education only at primary level, although the occasional bright student was coached at secondary level to enable them to enter university. By the 1920s the school had expanded to 226 children and in 1924 four children sat the matriculation exam. This sparked a growth in demand for secondary education, and in 1927 the school was split into two - Estcourt Junior School retaining the old school building and Estcourt High School (as the secondary school later became known) moving to Hospital Hill on the outskirts of the town. The new school had a boarding establishment, and soon the boarders outnumbered the day pupils. After the Second World War, both schools continued to grow and in 1960 a second primary school - Drakensview School - was built to accommodate the overflow from the Estcourt Junior School. Towards the end of the twentieth century, the Siraatul Haq Islamic School and Madrasah was established to serve the large local Muslim community with a combined educational option, offering both Islamic and a secular academic curriculum. As of 2018, it is the best performing private school in the district. Estcourt Today During the Apartheid era, Esctourt was a predominantly white and Asian town. The nearby Wembezi township was home to a large black population. In 1995 these two areas were incorporated into a transitional local council prior to the setting up of the uMtshezi Municipality. The new council continues to display the old Estcourt coat of arms on its letterheads. In 2008, the estimated population of the uMtshezi Municipality was 57189 blacks, 1726 coloureds, 6155 Asians and 3244 whites.

The Coeur d'Alene have sovereign control of their Coeur d'Alene Reservation, which includes a significant portion of Lake Coeur d'Alene and its submerged lands. In Idaho v. United States (2001), the United States Supreme Court ruled against the state's claim of the submerged lands of the lower third of Lake Coeur d'Alene and related waters of the St. Joe River. It said that the Coeur d'Alene were the traditional owners and that the Executive Branch and Congress had clearly included this area in their reservation, with compensation for ceded territory. This area was designated in 1983 by the Environmental Protection Agency as Bunker Hill Mine and Smelting Complex, the nation's second-largest Superfund site for cleanup. Concerned at the slow pace of progress, in 1991 the tribe filed suit against mining companies for damages and cleanup costs, joined in 1996 by the United States and in 2011 by the state of Idaho. Settlements were reached with major defendants in 2008 and 2011, providing funds to be used in removal of hazardous wastes and restoration of habitat and natural resources. Historically the Coeur d'Alene occupied a territory of 3.5 million acres in present-day northern Idaho, eastern Washington and western Montana. They lived in villages along the Coeur d'Alene, St. Joe, Clark Fork, and Spokane rivers, as well as sites on the shores of Lake Coeur d'Alene, Lake Pend Oreille, and Hayden Lake. Their native language is Snchitsu'umshtsn, an Interior Salishan language. They are one of the Salish language peoples, which tribes occupy areas of the inland plateau and the coastal areas of the Pacific Northwest. French Canadian fur traders in the late 18th or early 19th century referred to these people as the C≈ìur d'Al√®ne, meaning \\"heart of an awl,\\" in reference to their savvy in trading. British traders and later colonists adopted the French term for the people. Geography Historically, the Coeur d'Alene lived in what would become the Panhandle region of Idaho and neighboring areas of what is today eastern Washington and western Montana, occupying an area of more than 3.5 million acres (5,632,704 km¬≤) of grass-covered hills, camas-prairie, forested mountains, lakes, marshes and river habitat. The territory extended from the southern end of Lake Pend Oreille in the north, running along the Bitterroot Range of Montana in the east, to the Palouse and North Fork of the Clearwater River in the south, to Steptoe Butte and up to just east of Spokane Falls in the west. At the center of this region was Lake Coeur d'Alene. The abundant natural resources included trout, salmon, and whitefish. The tribe supplemented hunting and gathering activities by fishing the St. Joe and Spokane rivers. They used gaff hooks, spears, nets, and traps and angled for fish. History Coeur d'Alene Tribe original territory The tribe's oral history tells their creation story and their lengthy connections to this territory. The earliest written description of the Coeur d'Alene people comes from the journals of Alexander Henry the younger, a fur trader with the North West Company. He and British explorer David Thompson traded and traveled in the area from 1810 to 1814. He wrote about the Coeur d'Alene: > The Skeetshue [Skitsuish] or Pointed Hearts [Coeur d'Alene] Indians dwell > further southward [than the Kallispell or Pend d'Oreille tribes], about > Skeetshue [Coeur d'Alene] Lake and [Spokane] River; they are a distinct > nation, and have a different language [Salish] from the Flat Heads. They are > very numerous, and have a vast number of horses, as their country is open > and admits of breeding them in great abundance.Journals of Alexander Henry > and David Thompson, edited by Elliott Coues, Vol. II, p. 711 Ross Cox, a clerk with the Pacific Fur Company and then the North West Company, spent considerable time at the trading post of Spokane House between 1812 and 1817: > The Pointed Hearts, or as the [French] Canadians call them, les Coeurs d' > Al√™nes (Hearts of Awls), are a small tribe inhabiting the shores of a lake > about fifty miles to the eastward of Spokan House. Their country is > tolerably well stocked with beaver, deer, wild-fowl, &c.; and its vegetable > productions are similar to those of Spokan. Some of this tribe occasionally > visited our fort at the latter place with furs to barter, and we made a few > excursions to their lands. We found them uniformly honest in their traffic; > but they did not evince the same warmth of friendship for us as the Spokans, > and expressed no desire for the establishment of a trading post among them. > > About twenty years before our arrival [hence in the early 1790s], the > Spokans and Pointed Hearts were at war, caused by a kind of Trojan origin. A > party of the former [Spokane Indians] had been on a hunting visit to the > land of the latter [Coeur d'Alene], and were hospitably received. One day, a > young Spokan discovered the wife of a Pointed Heart alone, some distance > from the village, and violated her. Although she might have born this in > silence from one of her own tribe, she was not as equally forbearing with > regard to a stranger, and immediately informed her husband of the outrage. > He lost no time in seeking revenge, and shot the Spokan as he entered the > village. The others fled to their own lands, and prepared for war. A > succession of sanguinary conflicts followed, in the course of which the > greatest warriors of both side were nearly destroyed. At the end of a year, > however, hostilities ceased; since which period they have been at peace. The > two nations now intermarry, and appear to be on the best terms of > friendship.See Chapter 22 of Ross Cox's The Columbia River, or scenes and > adventures during a residence of six years on the western side of the Rocky > Mountains among various tribes of Indians hitherto unknown; together with \\"A > Journey across the American Continent,\\" first published in 1831). Many of the tribe were converted to Roman Catholicism in 1842 by Fr. Pierre- Jean De Smet, a Belgian Jesuit missionary from St. Louis, Missouri, who was active throughout the Northwest. The twin towns of De Smet and Tensed (originally Temsed), Idaho, are named for him. The United States acquired this territory in 1846 by treaty with Great Britain. European-American settlers and other immigrants began to move from the United States into parts of the territory in the 1840s. After the Indian defeat in the Skitswish War of May‚ÄìSeptember 1858, many more speculators were attracted after the discovery of silver in 1863 in the north Panhandle near the city of Coeur d'Alene. Mining and development revealed this to be an area of the second-largest silver deposits in the United States. In 1873 the Coeur d'Alene lands were reduced to approximately when President Ulysses S. Grant established the Coeur d'Alene Indian Reservation by executive order. Chief Peter Moctelme traveled to Washington D.C. to meet with the President to discuss his disagreement of allotments. Upon ratification, Chief Peter Moctelme's land was reduced by 1/3 and sold to white settlers. The US agreement with the tribe \\"expressly included part of the St. Joe River (then called the St. Joseph), and all of Lake Coeur d'Alene except a sliver cut off by the northern boundary.\\" As of 1885, Congress had neither ratified the 1873 agreement nor compensated the Tribe. This inaction prompted the Tribe to petition the Government again, to \\"make with us a proper treaty of peace and friendship ... by which your petitioners may be properly and fully compensated for such portion of their lands not now reserved to them; [and] that their present reserve may be confirmed to them.\\" Successive government acts put a reservation boundary across Lake Coeur d'Alene, rather than following customary practice of using the high water line, and reduced the size of the reservation to near Plummer, south of the town of Coeur d'Alene. 20th century to present Due to extensive mining and smelting operations in the Panhandle during the 19th and 20th centuries, there was hazardous waste in water discharges and pollution in air emissions. The mining industry \\"left several thousand acres of land and tributaries, connected to the Coeur d'Alene Basin, contaminated with heavy metals.\\" These mining operations have contributed \\"an estimated 100 million tons of mine waste to the river system.\\" In the early 21st century, the federally recognized Tribe has approximately 2,000 enrolled citizens. The Tribe manages the sovereign Coeur d'Alene Reservation, which includes the lower third of Lake Coeur d'Alene and the Saint Joe River, and their submerged lands. Members of the tribe reside in such area cities as DeSmet, Harrison, Parkline, Plummer, St. Maries (part on the reservation, population 734), Tensed, and Worley. In 1935, Ignace Garry was one of a group of chiefs who managed the tribe. In 1949 he was selected as the last traditional chief of the Coeur d'Alene; he served until his death in 1965. During this period the tribe worked to restore its government under the Indian Reorganization Act of 1934. It gained approval of a written constitution in 1949 and elected representatives to the Tribal Council. In the 1950s, the tribe was one of several that came under termination pressure by the United States Congress. It helped found the Affiliated Tribes of Northwest Indians, an organization to represent the Salish peoples in both Coastal and Plateau tribes, and resisted termination of its federal status. Within Idaho, in the late 20th century the Coeur d'Alene organized with the four other federally recognized tribes in the state to form the Five Tribes Council, including the Kootenai Tribe of Idaho, Nez Perce, Shoshone-Bannock, and Shoshone-Paiute. The peoples work together for mutual benefit, for instance, in applying for grants or negotiating with the state government on Native American affairs. =Government= The tribe reorganized under a written constitution approved by the Bureau of Indian Affairs, United States Department of Interior, on September 2, 1949, and amended in 1961. The constitution provides for an elected Tribal Council to serve as the legislature and governing body of the Tribe. It defined all tribal members of voting age as the General Council. At the time, the Tribe was still governed by Ignace Garry, the last traditional chief. The seven members of the tribal council are elected by citizens of the tribe to 3-year terms; with staggered expiration years. The elected head of the tribe is the Chairman. Since 2005, the chairman has been Chief James Allan (\\"Chief\\" is his given first name). Born in 1972 in Spokane, Allan grew up in Idaho on the Coeur d'Alene Reservation and graduated from Eastern Washington University in Cheney. He served in administrative and elected positions in the tribe and with the National Congress of American Indians in Washington, DC before being elected as chairman.\\"Tribal Council: Chief Bio\\" , Coeur d'Alene Tribe website Joseph Garry, son of Chief Ignace, was the first Native American to be elected to the Idaho state legislature. He also served as chairman of the tribe for 10 years. In 1984 his niece, Jeanne Givens, was the first Native American woman to be elected to the Idaho state legislature, serving two terms.Maureen Dolan, \\"The last traditional chief\\", CDA Press, 10 November 2010; accessed 30 May 2016 The Coeur d'Alene Tribe operates a health care facility, the Benewah Medical Center, which opened in 1998. The center was recognized as a national model for Indian Health Care and rural health care. The clinic provides comprehensive primary care services including dental, mental health services, and community health outreach services to both the Native American population and general community.\\"Area Offices: Portland; Tribe: Coeur d'Alene\\" , US Indian Health Service =Economy= Tribal businesses include the Coeur d'Alene Casino, Hotel, and Circling Raven Golf Club in southwestern Kootenai County, about three miles (5 km) northwest of Worley and thirty miles (50 km) south of the city of Coeur d'Alene, via U.S. Route 95. Tribal gaming employs about 500 and generates about $20 million in profits annually, funding programs, contributing to economic development. The tribe also operates the Benewah Automotive Center, the Benewah Market, the first three floors of the Coeur d'Alene Resort, and Ace Hardware, which are located a few miles south of Worley at Plummer, in northwestern Benewah County. The tribe has invested in two businesses, a manufacturing plant (BERG Integrated Systems), and a bakery (HearthBread Bakery), in both of which the tribe owns a majority share. The tribal farm covers about . It produces wheat, barley, peas, lentils, and canola. It also harvests timber among its natural resources. =Culture= Tribal traditions include a respect and reverence for natural law, and for responsible environmental stewardship. The tribe is active in the protection, conservation and enhancement of fish and wildlife resources; as well as conservation issues that impact tribal land and water resources. Traditionally the tribe had a flexible kinship system with both paternal and maternal lines recognized within the extended family. People may claim ancestors on either side, and address all cousins the same. This enabled them to have a flexible society, as they would live in differently sized groups during different seasons, in order to adapt to the environment. Environmental suit, land claim and compensation In 1991, the Coeur d'Alene Tribe began the Coeur d'Alene Basin Restoration Project. That year tribal leaders, including Henry SiJohn, Lawrence Aripa, and Richard Mullen, decided to file a lawsuit against the mining companies, as they were concerned that cleanup progress by EPA and the state was too slow in the Basin and at the Bunker Hill Mine and Smelting Complex Superfund site. They filed suit against Hecla Mining Company, ASARCO and other companies for damages and recovery of cleanup costs of the site. In 1996 their suit was joined by the United States. In 2001 the United States and the Coeur d'Alene litigated a 78-day trial against Hecla and ASARCO over liability issues. In 2008, ASARCO LLC, reached a settlement of $452 million with the Coeur d'Alene Tribe and United States for the Bunker Hill siteBecky Kramer, \\"Hecla Mining Co. settles Superfund cleanup lawsuit\\", The Spokesman, 14 June 2011; accessed 31 May 2016 after emerging from Chapter 11 bankruptcy.\\"Hecla Mining Company to Pay $263 Million in Settlement to Resolve Idaho Superfund Site Litigation and Foster Cooperation\\", Press release, US Department of Justice, 13 June 2011; accessed 31 May 2016 In 2011 the government, the Coeur d'Alene, and the state of Idaho (which joined the suit that year) reached settlement with the Hecla Mining Company to resolve one of the largest cases ever filed under CERCLA, the Superfund statute. Hecla Mining Company will pay $263.4 million plus interest to the United States and other parties to \\"resolve claims stemming from releases of wastes from its mining operations. Settlement funds will be dedicated to restoration and remediation of natural resources in the Coeur d'Alene Basin.\\" The trustees intend to restore habitat for fish, birds and other natural resources, for stewardship while working for economic progress in the region. This was one of the top 10 settlement cash awards in Superfund history. In a related case, at the turn of the 21st century, U.S. courts ruled in Idaho v. United States (2001) that the Coeur d'Alene tribe has legal jurisdiction over the submerged land of the lower third of Lake Coeur d'Alene, which the US holds in trust for the tribe, as well as under a related of the St. Joe River.Idaho v. United States 533 U.S. 262 (2001), JUSTIA: US Supreme Court, accessed 30 May 2016 The case was initiated by the US government to \\"quiet title\\" with the state, and the Tribe entered to assert its interest. The State of Idaho had appealed a lower court decision but that was upheld by the United States Supreme Court. The tribe has worked with the US Department of Justice in filing suit also against the Union Pacific Railroad over contamination of the lake and related lands.Dennis Zotigh, \\"Meet Native America: Paulette E.

The prison was in operation between 1949 and 1989. The island is located in the northern Adriatic Sea just off the coast of Primorje-Gorski Kotar County, Croatia with an area of approximately . Exposed to strong bora winds, particularly in the winter, the island's surface is almost completely devoid of vegetation, giving Goli Otok (\\"barren island\\" in Croatian) its name. It is also known as 'Croatian Alcatraz' because of its island location and high security. Goli Otok prison Despite having long been an occasional grazing ground for local shepherds' flocks, the barren island was apparently never permanently settled other than by the prisoners during the 20th century. Throughout World War I, Austria-Hungary sent Russian prisoners of war from the Eastern Front to Goli Otok. In 1949, the entire island was officially made into a high-security, top secret prison and labor camp run by the authorities of the People's Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, together with the nearby Sveti Grgur island, which held a similar camp for female prisoners. Until 1956, throughout the Informbiro period, it was used to incarcerate political prisoners. These included known and alleged Stalinists, but also other Communist Party of Yugoslavia members or even non-party citizens accused of exhibiting sympathy or leanings towards the Soviet Union. Many anti-communists (Serbian, Croatian, Macedonian, Albanian and other nationalists etc.) were also incarcerated on Goli Otok. Non-political prisoners were also sent to the island to serve out simple criminal sentences and some of them were sentenced to death. A total of approximately 16,000 political prisoners served there, of which between 400 and 600 died on the island. Other sources, largely based on various individual statements, claim almost 4,000 prisoners died in the camp.Goli Otok, AestOvest, Osservatorio Balcani e Caucaso 2008 The prison inmates were forced to labor (in a stone quarry, pottery and joinery), without regard to the weather conditions: in the summer the temperature would rise as high as , while in the winter they were subjected to the chilling bora wind and freezing temperatures. The prison was entirely inmate-run, and its hierarchical system forced the convicts into beating, humiliating, denouncing and shunning each other. Those who cooperated could hope to rise up the hierarchy and receive better treatment.https://www.tportal.hr/vijesti/clanak/nikada-necemo-saznati-cija-je- konkretno-ideja-o-osnivanju-logora-na-golom-otoku-foto-20190210 After Yugoslavia normalized relations with the Soviet Union, Goli Otok prison passed to the provincial jurisdiction of the People's Republic of Croatia (as opposed to the Yugoslav federal authorities). Regardless, the prison remained a taboo topic in Yugoslavia until the early 1980s. Antonije Isakoviƒá wrote the novel Tren (Moment) about the prison in 1979, waiting until after Josip Broz Tito's death in 1980 to release it. The book became an instant bestseller.Daniel J. Goulding, Liberated cinema: the Yugoslav experience, 1945-2001, Indiana University Press, 2002. (p. 159) The prison was shut down on 30 December 1988 and completely abandoned in 1989. Since then it has been left to ruin. It has since become a tourist attraction and is populated by shepherds from Rab.

The R-tree was proposed by Antonin Guttman in 1984 and has found significant use in both theoretical and applied contexts. A common real-world usage for an R-tree might be to store spatial objects such as restaurant locations or the polygons that typical maps are made of: streets, buildings, outlines of lakes, coastlines, etc. and then find answers quickly to queries such as \\"Find all museums within 2 km of my current location\\", \\"retrieve all road segments within 2 km of my location\\" (to display them in a navigation system) or \\"find the nearest gas station\\" (although not taking roads into account). The R-tree can also accelerate nearest neighbor search for various distance metrics, including great-circle distance.  R-tree idea  The key idea of the data structure is to group nearby objects and represent them with their minimum bounding rectangle in the next higher level of the tree; the \\"R\\" in R-tree is for rectangle. Since all objects lie within this bounding rectangle, a query that does not intersect the bounding rectangle also cannot intersect any of the contained objects. At the leaf level, each rectangle describes a single object; at higher levels the aggregation of an increasing number of objects. This can also be seen as an increasingly coarse approximation of the data set. Similar to the B-tree, the R-tree is also a balanced search tree (so all leaf nodes are at the same depth), organizes the data in pages, and is designed for storage on disk (as used in databases). Each page can contain a maximum number of entries, often denoted as M. It also guarantees a minimum fill (except for the root node), however best performance has been experienced with a minimum fill of 30%‚Äì40% of the maximum number of entries (B-trees guarantee 50% page fill, and B*-trees even 66%). The reason for this is the more complex balancing required for spatial data as opposed to linear data stored in B-trees. As with most trees, the searching algorithms (e.g., intersection, containment, nearest neighbor search) are rather simple. The key idea is to use the bounding boxes to decide whether or not to search inside a subtree. In this way, most of the nodes in the tree are never read during a search. Like B-trees, R-trees are suitable for large data sets and databases, where nodes can be paged to memory when needed, and the whole tree cannot be kept in main memory. Even if data can be fit in memory (or cached), the R-trees in most practical applications will usually provide performance advantages over naive check of all objects when the number of objects is more than few hundred or so. However, for in-memory applications, there are similar alternatives that can provide slightly better performance or be simpler to implement in practice. The key difficulty of R-tree is to build an efficient tree that on one hand is balanced (so the leaf nodes are at the same height) on the other hand the rectangles do not cover too much empty space and do not overlap too much (so that during search, fewer subtrees need to be processed). For example, the original idea for inserting elements to obtain an efficient tree is to always insert into the subtree that requires least enlargement of its bounding box. Once that page is full, the data is split into two sets that should cover the minimal area each. Most of the research and improvements for R-trees aims at improving the way the tree is built and can be grouped into two objectives: building an efficient tree from scratch (known as bulk- loading) and performing changes on an existing tree (insertion and deletion). R-trees do not guarantee good worst-case performance, but generally perform well with real-world data. While more of theoretical interest, the (bulk- loaded) Priority R-tree variant of the R-tree is worst-case optimal, but due to the increased complexity, has not received much attention in practical applications so far. When data is organized in an R-tree, the neighbors within a given distance r and the k nearest neighbors (for any Lp-Norm) of all points can efficiently be computed using a spatial join. This is beneficial for many algorithms based on such queries, for example the Local Outlier Factor. DeLi- Clu, Density-Link-Clustering is a cluster analysis algorithm that uses the R-tree structure for a similar kind of spatial join to efficiently compute an OPTICS clustering.  Variants  *Priority R-tree *R* tree *R+ tree *RR* tree *Hilbert R-tree *X-tree  Algorithm  = Data layout = Data in R-trees is organized in pages that can have a variable number of entries (up to some pre- defined maximum, and usually above a minimum fill). Each entry within a non- leaf node stores two pieces of data: a way of identifying a child node, and the bounding box of all entries within this child node. Leaf nodes store the data required for each child, often a point or bounding box representing the child and an external identifier for the child. For point data, the leaf entries can be just the points themselves. For polygon data (that often requires the storage of large polygons) the common setup is to store only the MBR (minimum bounding rectangle) of the polygon along with a unique identifier in the tree. = Search = In range searching, the input is a search rectangle (Query box). Searching is quite similar to searching in a B+ tree. The search starts from the root node of the tree. Every internal node contains a set of rectangles and pointers to the corresponding child node and every leaf node contains the rectangles of spatial objects (the pointer to some spatial object can be there). For every rectangle in a node, it has to be decided if it overlaps the search rectangle or not. If yes, the corresponding child node has to be searched also. Searching is done like this in a recursive manner until all overlapping nodes have been traversed. When a leaf node is reached, the contained bounding boxes (rectangles) are tested against the search rectangle and their objects (if there are any) are put into the result set if they lie within the search rectangle. For priority search such as nearest neighbor search, the query consists of a point or rectangle. The root node is inserted into the priority queue. Until the queue is empty or the desired number of results have been returned the search continues by processing the nearest entry in the queue. Tree nodes are expanded and their children reinserted. Leaf entries are returned when encountered in the queue. This approach can be used with various distance metrics, including great- circle distance for geographic data. = Insertion = To insert an object, the tree is traversed recursively from the root node. At each step, all rectangles in the current directory node are examined, and a candidate is chosen using a heuristic such as choosing the rectangle which requires least enlargement. The search then descends into this page, until reaching a leaf node. If the leaf node is full, it must be split before the insertion is made. Again, since an exhaustive search is too expensive, a heuristic is employed to split the node into two. Adding the newly created node to the previous level, this level can again overflow, and these overflows can propagate up to the root node; when this node also overflows, a new root node is created and the tree has increased in height.  Choosing the insertion subtree  At each level, the algorithm needs to decide in which subtree to insert the new data object. When a data object is fully contained in a single rectangle, the choice is clear. When there are multiple options or rectangles in need of enlargement, the choice can have a significant impact on the performance of the tree. In the classic R-tree, objects are inserted into the subtree that needs the least enlargement. In the more advanced R*-tree, a mixed heuristic is employed. At leaf level, it tries to minimize the overlap (in case of ties, prefer least enlargement and then least area); at the higher levels, it behaves similar to the R-tree, but on ties again preferring the subtree with smaller area. The decreased overlap of rectangles in the R*-tree is one of the key benefits over the traditional R-tree (this is also a consequence of the other heuristics used, not only the subtree choosing).  Splitting an overflowing node  Since redistributing all objects of a node into two nodes has an exponential number of options, a heuristic needs to be employed to find the best split. In the classic R-tree, Guttman proposed two such heuristics, called QuadraticSplit and LinearSplit. In quadratic split, the algorithm searches for the pair of rectangles that is the worst combination to have in the same node, and puts them as initial objects into the two new groups. It then searches for the entry which has the strongest preference for one of the groups (in terms of area increase) and assigns the object to this group until all objects are assigned (satisfying the minimum fill). There are other splitting strategies such as Greene's Split, the R*-tree splitting heuristic (which again tries to minimize overlap, but also prefers quadratic pages) or the linear split algorithm proposed by Ang and Tan (which however can produce very irregular rectangles, which are less performant for many real world range and window queries). In addition to having a more advanced splitting heuristic, the R*-tree also tries to avoid splitting a node by reinserting some of the node members, which is similar to the way a B-tree balances overflowing nodes. This was shown to also reduce overlap and thus increase tree performance. Finally, the X-tree can be seen as a R*-tree variant that can also decide to not split a node, but construct a so-called super-node containing all the extra entries, when it doesn't find a good split (in particular for high-dimensional data). = Deletion = Deleting an entry from a page may require updating the bounding rectangles of parent pages. However, when a page is underfull, it will not be balanced with its neighbors. Instead, the page will be dissolved and all its children (which may be subtrees, not only leaf objects) will be reinserted. If during this process the root node has a single element, the tree height can decrease. = Bulk- loading = * Nearest-X: Objects are sorted by their first coordinate (\\"X\\") and then split into pages of the desired size. * Packed Hilbert R-tree: variation of Nearest-X, but sorting using the Hilbert value of the center of a rectangle instead of using the X coordinate. There is no guarantee the pages will not overlap. * Sort-Tile-Recursive (STR): Another variation of Nearest-X, that estimates the total number of leaves required as l=\\\\lceil \\\\text{number of objects} / \\\\text{capacity}\\\\rceil, the required split factor in each dimension to achieve this as s=\\\\lceil l^{1/d}\\\\rceil, then repeatedly splits each dimensions successively into s equal sized partitions using 1-dimensional sorting. The resulting pages, if they occupy more than one page, are again bulk-loaded using the same algorithm. For point data, the leaf nodes will not overlap, and \\"tile\\" the data space into approximately equal sized pages. * Overlap Minimizing Top-down (OMT): Improvement over STR using a top-down approach which minimizes overlaps between slices and improves query performance. * Priority R-tree  See also  * Segment tree * Interval tree ‚Äì A degenerate R-tree for one dimension (usually time). * Bounding volume hierarchy * Spatial index * GiST  References   External links  * ","title":"R-tree"},{"id":"865252","text":"Ottaviano Del Turco (born 7 November 1944) is an Italian politician.

He was educated in the public schools and by private instructors. In 1894, he moved to Shelbyville, where he worked as a clerk at a hardware store. Two years later, he and his half-brother, W.A. McCord, opened a bookstore in Lewisburg (in Marshall County). From 1900 to 1910, McCord worked as a traveling salesman,Jim Nance McCord at the Biographical Directory of the United States Congress gaining invaluable insight into the needs of Middle Tennessee farmers. In 1901, McCord married Vera Kercheval, daughter of William Kercheval, publisher of the Lewisburg-based newspaper, the Marshall Gazette.William Thomas Hale and Dixon Merritt, A History of Tennessee and Tennesseans (Lewis Publishing Company, 1913), pp. 1715-1716.\\"Biographies of George Wythe Ewing and William K. Kercheval,\\" Goodspeed's History of Tennessee, 1886. Accessed at USGWarchives.net, 17 December 2012. In 1910, he began a long newspaper career as editor and publisher of the Gazette after purchasing a stake in the paper from his father-in-law. Two years later, he bought out his father-in-law's remaining shares. As an editor, McCord supported the \\"Independent\\" Democrats, a pro-temperance faction of the state Democratic Party, in the early 1910s. In the 1930s, he supported Franklin D. Roosevelt and the New Deal. In 1942, McCord was elected president of the Tennessee Press Association. McCord had a lifelong interest in livestock breeding, focusing mainly on Jersey cattle and Tennessee Walking Horses. He began working as an auctioneer of purebred Jersey cattle in 1920, and helped convince the U.S. Department of Agriculture to establish an experimental dairy farm specializing in Jersey cattle near Lewisburg in the 1930s. In 1935, McCord helped form the Tennessee Walking Horse Breeders Association. McCord's political career began in 1914, when he was elected to the Marshall County Court. In 1916, he was elected Mayor of Lewisburg, serving until 1942 (13 consecutive terms). He was an elector for Roosevelt in 1932, and was a delegate to the Democratic National Convention in 1940. In 1942, he ran unopposed for the 5th district seat in the U.S. House of Representatives (the incumbent, Percy Priest, had been redistricted). Governor In 1944, McCord sought his party's nomination for governor in the race to succeed the incumbent, Prentice Cooper, who was term-limited.Phillip Langsdon, Tennessee: A Political History (Franklin, Tenn.: Hillsboro Press, 2000), pp. 336-343. With the support of powerful Memphis political boss, E. H. Crump, McCord won the primary by a lopsided margin over Nashville attorney Rex Manning and Knoxville law professor John R. Neal, and defeated the Republican candidate, Greeneville attorney John Wesley Kilgo, in the general election, 275,746 votes to 158,742. During his first term, McCord obtained significant appropriations for education, including $4 million for monthly raises for teachers and principals, and funding to provide tuition assistance for returning World War II veterans. He also signed a retirement law for state employees. In the 1946 gubernatorial campaign, McCord beat back a primary challenge from former governor Gordon Browning (who was in Germany and did not actively campaign), and easily defeated the Republican candidate, W.O. Lowe, in the general election. The 1946 primary was marred by an uprising known as the \\"Battle of Athens,\\" which erupted when several hundred ex-World War II veterans launched an armed assault on the jail in Athens, Tennessee, where the sheriff and several Crump-linked figures had retreated with ballot boxes, presumably to fix local elections.Jennifer Brooks, \\"Battle of Athens,\\" Tennessee Encyclopedia of History and Culture, 2009. Retrieved: 17 December 2012. McCord dispatched the state guard to restore order. During his second term, McCord enacted a 2% sales tax, which Crump had reluctantly agreed not to oppose. The revenue from this tax was used to build new schools, buy school buses, and help implement the state's first comprehensive program for grades 1 through 12. McCord also enacted right-to-work legislation, which was made possible by the Taft-Hartley Act of 1947. The enactment of this law alienated the party's organized labor constituency. In the governor's race of 1948, Browning, determined to break the Crump machine, ran a strong campaign for the nomination. He assailed McCord for the sales tax, and accused Crump of voter fraud. Gradually, important constituencies, including veterans, black voters, rural voters, and organized labor, began abandoning Crump and McCord. On election day, Browning defeated McCord for the nomination, 231,852 votes to 158,854. It was the first defeat of a Crump-backed candidate in a major state election in over two decades. Later life McCord was a delegate to the limited state constitutional convention of 1953, which submitted several important changes to the voters for approval, most notably extension of the gubernatorial term from two to four years, and the repeal of the state's poll tax.Governor Prentice Cooper Papers (finding aid) , Tennessee State Library and Archives, April 2002.

Due to close orbital similarities, most of the other, smaller, members of the L5 group are hypothesized to be fragments of 5261 Eureka that were detached after it was spun up by the YORP effect (consistent with its rotational period of 2.69 h). The infrared spectrum for 5261 Eureka is typical for an A-type asteroid, but the visual spectrum is consistent with an evolved form of achondrite called an angrite. A-class asteroids are tinted red in hue, with a moderate albedo. The asteroid is located deep within a stable Lagrangian zone of Mars, which is considered indicative of a primordial origin‚Äîmeaning the asteroid has most likely been in this orbit for much of the history of the Solar System. Satellite On November 28, 2011, a natural satellite of 5261 Eureka was found. It has yet to be named, and its provisional designation is S/2011 (5261) 1.

The loudspeaker broadcasts the voice or voices of those on the other end of the telephone line, while the microphone captures all voices of those using the speakerphone. The term speakerphone is also sometimes used for loudspeaker, as in \\"put it on speakerphone\\". Many telephones have an integrated speakerphone function which can be activated by pushing a single button. This button transfers the sound input and output from the handset to the ambient microphone and loudspeaker. Devices designed specifically for speakerphone use often have multiple microphone inputs arranged radially around the device to maximize sound input, such as may occur around a conference table. The most sophisticated units allow the connection of additional satellite microphones that can be placed some distance from the main unit. Types of speakerphones Speakerphones may be broadly divided into two classes of Duplex: * Half-duplex * Full-duplex Half-duplex speakerphones only allow sound to travel in one direction at a time, either: 1) into the speakerphone from the telephone line and out of its internal speaker to its user, or 2) from its user, into the microphone, and out through the telephone line. While the users of the speakerphone are speaking, the phone only transmits sound to the telephone line; its internal speaker is cut off and no sound arriving from the telephone line can be heard by the user. While the user of the speakerphone is quiet, the speakerphone only receives sound from the telephone line and its internal speaker broadcasts that sound to its user. There is a very definite, noticeable switching action each time the phone \\"changes directions\\" and a cough or other transient noise in the room may interrupt incoming sound from the far end of the telephone connection. Full-duplex speakerphones are able to transmit and receive simultaneously and there is no discernible change of transmission direction. These phones are much more complicated and often employ sophisticated digital signal processing algorithms to sort out the incoming sound and the sound in the room for echo cancellation. Their cost is also higher than for a half- duplex speakerphone. Speakerphone setup Many modern speakerphones must first be calibrated to the acoustic characteristics of the room in which they will be used. During this calibration phase, they may make a variety of noises including ascending tones or chiming sounds. This calibration may be automatic or manually invoked by the user, and it may need to be repeated if the speakerphone is relocated within the room. A failure to be properly calibrated can be indicated by the occurrence of echoing, ringing sounds, or feedback. Handset vs. base speakerphone Many cordless telephones have a handset speakerphone as well as a base speakerphone. The handset speakerphone allows hands free conversations away from the base unit. The base speakerphone is located in the base unit. The user must be at the base unit, but still gets the added benefits of having hands free conversations. Most base speakerphones have a secondary keypad for dialing calls on the base unit.

Whenever the course of the problem lasts long, chronic liver disease ensues. Signs and symptoms Some of the signs and symptoms of liver disease are the following: * Jaundice * Confusion and altered consciousness caused by hepatic encephalopathy. * Thrombocytopenia and coagulopathy. * Risk of bleeding symptoms particularly taking place in gastrointestinal tract * Ascites, the accumulation of fluid in the abdominal cavity. Cause Ground glass hepatocytes Primary biliary cirrhosis Budd-chiari syndrome There are more than a hundred different kinds of liver disease. These are some of the most common: * Fascioliasis, a parasitic infection of liver caused by a liver fluke of the genus Fasciola, mostly the Fasciola hepatica. * Hepatitis, inflammation of the liver, is caused by various viruses (viral hepatitis) also by some liver toxins (e.g. alcoholic hepatitis), autoimmunity (autoimmune hepatitis) or hereditary conditions. * Alcoholic liver disease is a hepatic manifestation of alcohol overconsumption, including fatty liver disease, alcoholic hepatitis, and cirrhosis. Analogous terms such as \\"drug-induced\\" or \\"toxic\\" liver disease are also used to refer to disorders caused by various drugs. * Fatty liver disease (hepatic steatosis) is a reversible condition where large vacuoles of triglyceride fat accumulate in liver cells. Non- alcoholic fatty liver disease is a spectrum of disease associated with obesity and metabolic syndrome. * Hereditary diseases that cause damage to the liver include hemochromatosis, involving accumulation of iron in the body, and Wilson's disease. Liver damage is also a clinical feature of alpha 1-antitrypsin deficiency and glycogen storage disease type II. * In transthyretin-related hereditary amyloidosis, the liver produces a mutated transthyretin protein which has severe neurodegenerative or cardiopathic effects. Liver transplantation can give a curative treatment option. * Gilbert's syndrome, a genetic disorder of bilirubin metabolism found in a small percent of the population, can cause mild jaundice. * Cirrhosis is the formation of fibrous tissue (fibrosis) in the place of liver cells that have died due to a variety of causes, including viral hepatitis, alcohol overconsumption, and other forms of liver toxicity. Cirrhosis causes chronic liver failure. * Primary liver cancer most commonly manifests as hepatocellular carcinoma or cholangiocarcinoma; rarer forms include angiosarcoma and hemangiosarcoma of the liver. (Many liver malignancies are secondary lesions that have metastasized from primary cancers in the gastrointestinal tract and other organs, such as the kidneys, lungs.) * Primary biliary cirrhosis is a serious autoimmune disease of the bile capillaries. * Primary sclerosing cholangitis is a serious chronic inflammatory disease of the bile duct, which is believed to be autoimmune in origin. * Budd‚ÄìChiari syndrome is the clinical picture caused by occlusion of the hepatic vein. Mechanism Liver disease can occur through several mechanisms: =DNA damage= One general mechanism, increased DNA damage, is shared by some of the major causes of liver disease. These major causes include infection by hepatitis B virus or hepatitis C virus, alcohol abuse, and obesity. Viral infection by hepatitis B virus (HBV) or hepatitis C virus (HCV) causes an increase of reactive oxygen species (ROS). The increase in intracellular ROS is about 10,000-fold upon chronic HBV infection and 100,000-fold after HCV infection. This increase in ROS causes inflammation and further increase in ROS. ROS cause more than 20 types of DNA damage. Oxidative DNA damage is mutagenic and also causes epigenetic alterations at the sites of DNA repair. Epigenetic alterations and mutations affect the cellular machinery that may cause the cell to replicate at a higher rate or result in the cell avoiding apoptosis, and thus contribute to liver disease. By the time accumulating epigenetic and mutational changes eventually cause hepatocellular carcinoma, epigenetic alterations appear to have an even larger role in carcinogenesis than mutations. Only one gene, TP53, is mutated in more than 20% of liver cancers while 41 genes each have hypermethylated promoters (repressing gene expression) in more than 20% of liver cancers. Alcohol consumption in excess causes a build-up of acetaldehyde. Acetaldehyde and free radicals generated by metabolizing alcohol induce DNA damage and oxidative stress. In addition, activation of neutrophils in alcoholic liver disease contributes to the pathogenesis of hepatocellular damage by releasing reactive oxygen species (which can damage DNA). The level of oxidative stress and acetaldehyde-induced DNA adducts due to alcohol consumption does not appear sufficient to cause increased mutagenesis. However, as reviewed by Nishida et al., alcohol exposure, causing oxidative DNA damage (which is repairable), can result in epigenetic alterations at the sites of DNA repair. Alcohol-induced epigenetic alterations of gene expression appear to lead to liver injury and ultimately carcinoma. Obesity is associated with higher risk of primary liver cancer. As shown with mice, obese mice are prone to liver cancer, likely due to two factors. Obese mice have increased pro-inflammatory cytokines. Obese mice also have higher levels of deoxycholic acid (DCA), a product of bile acid alteration by certain gut microbes, and these microbes are increased with obesity. The excess DCA causes DNA damage and inflammation in the liver, which, in turn, can lead to liver cancer. =Other relevant aspects= A common form of liver disease is viral infection. Viral hepatitides such as Hepatitis B virus and Hepatitis C virus can be vertically transmitted during birth via contact with infected blood. According to a 2012 NICE publication, \\"about 85% of hepatitis B infections in newborns become chronic\\". In occult cases, Hepatitis B virus is present by HBV DNA, but testing for HBsAg is negative. High consumption of alcohol can lead to several forms of liver disease including alcoholic hepatitis, alcoholic fatty liver disease, cirrhosis, and liver cancer. In the earlier stages of alcoholic liver disease, fat builds up in the liver's cells due to increased creation of triglycerides and fatty acids and a decreased ability to break down fatty acids. Progression of the disease can lead to liver inflammation from the excess fat in the liver. Scarring in the liver often occurs as the body attempts to heal and extensive scarring can lead to the development of cirrhosis in more advanced stages of the disease. Approximately 3‚Äì10% of individuals with cirrhosis develop a form of liver cancer known as hepatocellular carcinoma.According to Tilg, et al., gut microbiome could very well have an effect, be involved in the pathophysiology, on the various types of liver disease which an individual may encounter. =Air pollutants= Particulate matter (PM) or carbon black (CB) are common pollutants. The following factors are the harmful effects of liver exposure under PM or CB. First, they have an obvious direct toxic effect on the liver. Chemicals will affect metabolism and impact liver function. Second, inflammation of liver caused by PM and CB impact lipid metabolism and fatty liver disease. Third, PM and CB can translocate from lung to liver. PM and CB can easily translocate from lung to liver. Because they are very diverse and each has different toxicodynamics, detailed mechanisms are not clear. Water-soluble fractions of PM is the most important part for PM translocation to liver through extra-pulmonary circulation. When PM goes through blood vessel into blood, it combines with immune cells, that will stimulate innate immune responses. Pro-inflammatory cytokines will be released and cause disease progression. Diagnosis A number of liver function tests (LFTs) are available to test the proper function of the liver. These test for the presence of enzymes in blood that are normally most abundant in liver tissue, metabolites or products. serum proteins, serum albumin, serum globulin, alanine transaminase, aspartate transaminase, prothrombin time, partial thromboplastin time. Imaging tests such as transient elastography, ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging can be used to examine the liver tissue and the bile ducts. Liver biopsy can be performed to examine liver tissue to distinguish between various conditions; tests such as elastography may reduce the need for biopsy in some situations. In liver disease, prothrombin time is longer than usual. In addition, the amounts of both coagulation factors and anticoagulation factors are reduced because the liver cannot productively synthsize them as it did when healthy. Nonetheless, there are two exceptions in this falling tendency, that are, coagulation factor VIII and von Willebrand factor, a platelet adhesive protein. Both inversely rise in the setting of hepatic insufficiency, thanks to the drop of hepatic clearance and compensatory productions from other sites of the body. Fibrinolysis generally proceeds faster in the scenarios of acute liver failure as well as advanced stage of liver disease in contrast to chronic liver disease in which concentration of fibrinogen remains unchanged. A previously undiagnosed liver disease may become evident first after autopsy. Following are gross pathology images: File:Gross pathology of alcoholic liver cirrhosis.jpgDiffuse cirrhosis File:WƒÖtroba marska (Ultima Thule).jpgMacronodular cirrhosis File:Nutmeg liver (crop).jpgNutmeg texture of congestive hepatopathy File:Human liver with metastatic lesions from primary pancreas carcinoma (2).jpgLiver metastases Treatment Ursodeoxycholic acid Anti-viral medications are available to treat infections such as hepatitis B. Other conditions may be managed by slowing down disease progression, for example: * By using steroid-based drugs in autoimmune hepatitis. * Regularly removing a quantity of blood from a vein (venesection) in the iron overload condition, hemochromatosis. * Wilson‚Äôs disease, a condition where copper builds up in the body, can be managed with drugs that bind copper, allowing it to be passed from the body in urine. * In cholestatic liver disease, (where the flow of bile is affected due to cystic fibrosis) a medication called ursodeoxycholic acid (URSO, also referred to as UDCA) may be given.

Gameplay Violence is a satire of conventional dungeon-bashing games, set in a contemporary metropolis where the player characters dash from room to room killing the occupants and stealing their belongings. In a style reminiscent of Mad, it is relentlessly user-hostile, taking time out to insult the reader wherever possible (it opens with the words, \\"Welcome to Violence, you degraded turd\\") and uses a system where the user can buy experience points for cash from the designer or publisher. Despite the innovative game design and exhaustive lists of equipment and weapons (including both belt and orbital sanders), monster types and possible scenarios, it is largely and deliberately unplayable because of an exhaustive rule-set. The rule-set provides information on a range of things related to killing. Weapons, combat styles, and the like are intricately detailed, considering the short length of the volume. Violence is a rant against the traditional styles of Dungeons & Dragons, MMORPGs, and the Grand Theft Auto series, written to simultaneously annoy, enrage and challenge the reader. As a game, it is of little value, but is useful as an insight into the mindset of its author and an indictment of an endemic style of role-playing. The cover art was by Clint Langley. A Spanish language edition exists. History Violence (1999), by Greg Costikyan (aka Designer X), was one of the New Style role-playing games published by Hogshead Publishing. According to Shannon Appelcline, Violence \\"was probably the least loved of the New Style games. Like Power Kill it was a largely social commentary. It used humor and satire to critique violence in role-playing games and was sufficiently biting that Wallis thought of it as a Modest Proposal for the role-playing Game industry. Set in the modern day, Violence lets players do dungeon crawls into places like the homes of illegal immigrants, kills them and takes their stuff. However, satire did not necessarily produce a playable role-playing game on its own.\\" In August 2005, Costikyan released Violence under a Creative Commons license, and made it available for download. Violence was part of a series of experimental and alternative role-playing games published by Hogshead Publishing.

Early life Cyril Edward Gourley was born in Wavertree, Liverpool and educated at Calday Grange Grammar School and Liverpool University, graduating in 1913. First World War service Gourley had joined 7th Lancashire Battery of the IV West Lancashire (Howitzer) Brigade, Royal Field Artillery (Territorial Force) in May 1914. He was mobilised with his unit on the outbreak of war in August 1914 and went with it to the Western Front. His battery was transferred to CCLXXVI (276) Brigade in 1916. In September 1917, he was awarded the Military Medal for conspicuous gallantry in putting out a fire near an ammunition dump. =Victoria Cross= Gourley was 24 years old, and a sergeant in D (Howitzer) Battery of 276th (West Lancashire) Brigade, RFA, when the following deed took place for which he was awarded the VC.National Archives. On 30 November 1917 at Little Priel Farm, east of Epehy, France, during the Battle of Cambrai, Sergeant Gourley was in command of a section of howitzers of the 55th (West Lancashire) Division. During an enemy advance, when their forces were within a few hundred yards of him, both to the front and on one flank, and though plagued by snipers, Sergeant Gourley managed to keep one gun firing. At one point he pulled the gun out of the pit and engaged a machine-gun at 500 yards, knocking it out with a direct hit. All day he held the Germans in check, firing over open sights on enemy parties, thereby saving his guns, which were withdrawn at nightfall.Anon, History pp. 35‚Äì42Anon, History; Appendix VI.Coop, p. 173.Litchfield, Appendix II.Farndale, Western Front, p. 250.

A History of Calday Grange Grammar School, West Kirby, 1636-1976 (1976) Post-war From 1919, Gourley worked for Lever Brothers, travelling widely to open up new business for the company. On his retirement a director of the company spoke of \\"...his quiet, gentle courteousness and his readiness to do all he could for other people. In fact he was a jolly good man to have beside you when you were in trouble\\". In 1925, the Gourley family moved to Hill Close, School Lane, off Column Road, Grange, West Kirby; the house was later renamed Gourley Grange and the lane renamed Gourley's Lane in his honour. The gardens created by the Gourley family have now been redeveloped as a small housing estate. During the Second World War, Gourley was a firewatcher in Liverpool. In 1952, he moved to Haslemere, Surrey, where he died on 31 January 1982. He is buried in Grange Cemetery, West Kirby, Wirral.Findagrave Gourley never married. The Trustees of The Cyril Edward Gourley Victoria Cross Endowment, Registered Charity 525987, set up in his honour after the First World War from local donations, provide grants to University Students who attended schools, or reside in the Hoylake and West Kirby area, subject to certain conditions.

It is considered the primary form of ensemble for the interpretation of the most sacred and \\"high-class\\" compositions of the Thai classical repertoire, including the Buddhist invocation entitled sathukan () as well as the suites called phleng rueang. It is also used to accompany traditional Thai theatrical and dance forms including khon () (masked dance-drama), lakhon (classical dance), and shadow puppet theater. Piphat in the earlier time was called phinphat. It is analogous to its Cambodian musical ensemble of pinpeat and Laotian ensemble of pinphat. Types of piphat The smallest piphat, called piphat khrueang ha, is composed of six instruments: pi nai (oboe); ranat ek (xylophone); khong wong yai (gong circle); taphon or other Thai drums; glong thad, a set of two large barrel drums beaten with sticks; and ching (small cymbals). Often other small percussion instruments such as krap or chap are used. A slightly larger piphat ensemble is called piphat khrueang khu, and consists of eight musical instruments. The other two instruments are the ranat thum (xylophone), which produces a deeper sound than the ranat ek, and khong wong lek, a gong circle that is higher in pitch than the khong wong yai. The largest form of piphat ensemble is the piphat khrueang yai, which consists of ten musical instruments. Another ones are ranat ek lek and ranat thum lek; these are almost the same as their ancestors, the ranat ek and ranat thum, but they have keys made from metal instead of wood. =Piphat khrueang ha= Wong piphat khrueang ha (, ) is an ensemble consisting of: # 1 pi nai - bass oboe # 1 taphon - secondary beat # 1 ching - main beat # 1 khong wong yai - bass gongs hung in a nearly full circular track # 2 glong thad - Thai tympani # 1 ranat ek - treble xylophone =Piphat khrueang khu= Wong piphat khrueang khu (, ) is developed from piphat khrueang ha, by arranging instruments in pairs of treble-bass. It consists of: # 1 pi nai - bass oboe # 1 pi nok - treble oboe # 1 taphon - secondary timekeeper # 1 glong songna or 2 glong khaek # 2 glong thad - Thai tympani # 1 ching - main timekeeper # 1 chap # 1 khong wong yai - bass gongs hung in semicircular track # 1 khong wong lek - treble version of gongs hung in semicircular track # 1 khong mong # 1 ranat ek - treble xylophone # 1 ranat thum - bass xylophone =Piphat khrueang yai= Wong piphat khrueang yai (, ) is arranged by adding ranat ek lek (‡∏£‡∏∞‡∏ô‡∏≤‡∏î‡πÄ‡∏≠‡∏Å‡πÄ‡∏´‡∏•‡πá‡∏Å; treble metallophone) and ranat thum lek (‡∏£‡∏∞‡∏ô‡∏≤‡∏î‡∏ó‡∏∏‡πâ‡∏°‡πÄ‡∏´‡∏•‡πá‡∏Å; bass metallophone) to the wong piphat khrueang khu. =Piphat nang hong= Wong piphat nang hong (, ) is an ensemble used in funerals. It is arranged by replacing the pi nai and pi nok with a pi chawa. The name nang hong comes from name of its main music, which is intended for funeral ceremonies. A royal variant, Wong piphat nang hong khruang yai (for the King) or Wong piphat nang hong khrueang khu (for senior members of the Royal Family), introduced during the reign of King Vajiravudh (Rama VI) for use in royal funerals of the Chakri Dynasty, was reinstated during the reign of King Bhumibol Adulyadej (Rama IX) in 1995, during the state funeral rites for Srinagarindra, the Princess Mother, upon the initiative of Princess Maha Chakri Sirindhorn, the Princess Royal, after years of absence.http://www.bangkokpost.com/print/1123237/ If playing for the king, the royal funeral ensemble has 10 to 12 instruments played, a few more than the simple ensemble, for senior members 8 to 9 instruments are used. In some funerals in Thailand the nang hong variant ensemble is supplemented by Western instruments like trumpets, saxophones, clarinets and even a drum kit, guitars and an electric piano. Some of these have also appeared in the normal ensembles. =Piphat duek dam ban= Wong piphat duek dam ban (, , literally \\"ancient ensemble\\") was proposed by Prince Naris for using in Thai opera. It consists of: #1 ranat ek #1 taphon #1 ranat thum #1 ranat thum lek #1 khong wong yai #1 ching #1 taphon - \\"tympani\\" made by using two taphons arranged together. #1 saw u #1 khlui u - bass flute #1 khlui phiang aw - medium #1 wong khong chai - a set of 7 khong chai with different size hung on wooden bar. =Piphat mon= Piphat Mon exhibited at Cit√© de la Musique, Paris The piphat mon is believed to derive from the Mon people, an ancient Mon-Khmer-speaking people of mainland Southeast Asia, and uses special instruments such as an upright gong circle called khong mon. Wong piphat mon (, ) has three sizes: Piphat mon khrueang ha Wong piphat mon khrueang ha (, ) consists of: #1 ranat ek #1 pi mon - bass oboe with horn-shaped end. #1 khong mon wong yai - a set of bass gongs set in vertical frame (unlike khong wong yai, which gongs are set in horizontal semicircular frame). #1 poengmang khok (‡πÄ‡∏õ‡∏¥‡∏á‡∏°‡∏≤‡∏á‡∏Ñ‡∏≠‡∏Å) or khok poeng (‡∏Ñ‡∏≠‡∏Å‡πÄ‡∏õ‡∏¥‡∏á) - Mon drums set in cage-shaped frame. # ching, chap and khong mong Piphat mon khrueang khu Wong piphat mon khrueang khu (, ) is arranged by adding ranat thum and khong mon wong lek to the piphat mon khrueang ha. Piphat mon khrueang yai Wong piphat mon khrueang yai (, ) is arranged by adding ranat ek lek and ranat thum lek to the piphat mon khrueang khu. The piphat mon ensemble is usually used in funerals, but it can be used for other events as well. The piphat ensemble can be mixed with the khrueang sai ensemble to create a new ensemble called khrueang sai prasom piphat (‡πÄ‡∏Ñ‡∏£‡∏∑‡πà‡∏≠‡∏á‡∏™‡∏≤‡∏¢‡∏õ‡∏£‡∏∞‡∏™‡∏°‡∏õ‡∏µ‡πà‡∏û‡∏≤‡∏ó‡∏¢‡πå or ‡πÄ‡∏Ñ‡∏£‡∏∑‡πà‡∏≠‡∏á‡∏™‡∏≤‡∏¢‡∏ú‡∏™‡∏°‡∏õ‡∏µ‡πà‡∏û‡∏≤‡∏ó‡∏¢‡πå). Similar ensembles The three major indigenous genres of gong-chime music prevalent in Southeast Asia includes the gamelan of western Indonesia; the kulintang of the southern Philippines, eastern Indonesia, and eastern Malaysia; and the piphat of Thailand, Cambodia, Laos, and the hsaing waing of Burma. The Cambodian equivalent of the piphat is called pinpeat. The Myanmar equivalent to piphat is known as hsaing waing. The instrumentation is very similar to the Piphat Mon, which indicates a common origin.

Along with Greek MEP Dimitris Tsatsos, he was one of the European Parliament's two official observers at the EU negotiations that culminated in the Treaty of Nice, a deal which he later harshly criticized. Brok has been an early proponent of having the European Union abandon its old method of leaving constitutional negotiations to national leaders. In 2013, however, he opposed German plans to hold national referendums for major decisions on Europe; he argued that \\"[i]f this was implemented in Germany, it would be seen abroad as putting an end to further development of the EU, the EU would become ineffective.\\"Sabine Siebold and Noah Barkin (November 12, 2013), German parties urge referendums on major EU decisions Reuters.

According to journalist Lutz M√ºkke (2005) Brok used his influence to ban Hajo Friedrich, who published a critical article concerning Brok's muddy activities, from the political ressort of the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung. In an interview with the German newspaper Die Tageszeitung, Brok reflected his activities and stated that for him politics was not profession, but hobby. Accordingly, critics of Brok call him a \\"hobbyist\\". In 2011, members of the European Parliament Committee on Legal Affairs voted unanimously against a request by German prosecutors to lift Brok‚Äôs immunity in a tax blunder.Wording of the rejection of the request for waiver of the immunity of Elmar Brok Italian MEP Francesco Speroni had been tasked to write the parliament's view on the matter.Valentina Pop (February 28, 2011), [Veteran MEP keeps immunity in tax blunder] EUobserver.

Femen accused Brok of soliciting the services of Ukrainian prostitutes and insulting Ukrainian women. Although Femen never disclosed its source, instead mentioning \\"reliable informations\\"(sic), the Kyiv Post reported shortly after that circumstantial evidence points to First Deputy Prosecutor General of Ukraine Renat Kuzmin being involved. The European External Action Service denied all allegations against Brok, citing his intensive agenda during his visit.

Its vertical drop of is the eighth largest in New England and the fifth largest in Vermont.Accurate Ski Resort Ranking with monthly updates. Verticalfeet.com. Retrieved 2014-04-12. Although mostly located in the town of Jay, Vermont, part of the resort, including the summit of Jay Peak, the Jet Triple Chair area and much of the Big Jay backcountry descent, is located in the town of Westfield, Vermont. The resort is just 4 miles (6.5 km) south of the Canada‚ÄìUnited States border, above which is the Province of Quebec. Jay Peak Resort was owned and operated by a group of investors headed by Bill Stenger. The resort opened for skiing in 1957, and it now includes year-round activities. The mountain offers 78 trails served by nine lifts. It receives the most snowfall of any ski area in the Northeastern U.S. In 2008, prior to a major expansion of the resort's facilities, the property was valued by the town of Jay at slightly over $12 million. On April 14, 2016 Jay Peak and sister mountain Burke Mountain Ski Area (QBurke) were seized by US government officials amid complaints regarding fraudulent offerings of securities.Official Case Documents case: 16-21301 from SEC\\"Jay Peak could close\\", April 25, 2016 The resort's liquidity issues were resolved for the timebeing, and the resort remains operational; it has been offered for sale by the government receiver. History View of Jay Peak from the north, showing many ski trails The ski trails were carved into the mountain during the 1950s primarily by its first ski school director/general manager, Walter Foeger, an Austrian and former racer who had previously trained the Spanish Olympic ski team. He arrived in 1956. He developed a method of teaching parallel skiing that avoided first having to teach the student snowplow/stem turns. Instead, students were taught to change direction by means of a slight hop keeping the tips of the skis on the snow, and displacing the back of the skis sideways. He called his ski teaching method \\"Natur Teknik\\" (natural technique). The Jay Peak ski school offered a \\"learn to ski in a week\\" guarantee. The method was adopted by a number of other ski areas. In 1955, the resort's first ski lift, a T-bar, was purchased. In January 1957, the resort opened for skiing. In 1968 Weyerhaeuser invested $300,000 in the predecessor organization, Jay Peak, Inc., and loaned it $2.2 million. A 48-room hotel was built in the mid-1970s. In 1978 Mont Saint-Sauveur International bought the resort. In 2006, the resort employed 550 people in the winter, 100 in the summer. In 2007, the resort agreed to pay the State of Vermont $105,000 for violating stormwater rules in polluting a stream while building a new golf course. Despite a drop in skier visits statewide during the 2006‚Äì2007 season, Jay Peak saw a record year with skier visits up 7%. In 2007‚Äì2008, the resort reported a record 320,000 skiers for the winter. In 2008, it was the second biggest employer in the area. Before 2008, Mount Saint Sauveur Incorporated, a Canadian firm, owned the resort. They started an EB-5 program to finance development. In 2008, a group headed by Bill Stenger purchased the resort. Stenger's plan was to invest $100 million in capital improvements for the resort over the next few years. The resort company raised $250 million for improvements in 2009‚Äì2010, from 250 investors from 43 companies through the incentive of the federal EB-5 visa. Under this visa, every $500,000 invested in the U.S. that results in ten new jobs gains the investor permanent residence. A three-way swap was made with the State of Vermont in 2010. The State deeded to the resort; the resort relinquished its lease to a parcel of nearby undeveloped forest back to the state; and the resort sold to the Green Mountain Club to ensure that the nearby of Long Trail would have a permanent buffer from ski- area development. In 2010, $13 million worth of improvements were made including an indoor ice arena, a parking garage, an enclosed beginners surface lift, and a new RFID ticketing system. The old Hotel Jay was razed and replaced with a new 170-room one. The new facilities also include a spa, conference center and water park.\\"Pump House Indoor Waterpark\\", Jay Peak Resort, accessed March 11, 2013 Also in 2010, Yankee magazine named Jay as the best ski resort in New England. In 2011, the resort agreed to pay an $80,000 fine to the United States Environmental Protection Agency for filling in of wetlands to construct a golf course in 2004‚Äì2006, without a permit from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. This was the same event for which the resort paid a fine to the state in 2007. Management planned to expand the skiing to a new area to be known as the West Bowl. The expansion has been postponed several times, and it is unsure whether the resort has the support of the state to conduct such major construction in the forest. Trails and lifts Jay Peak As of 2013, the mountain currently offers 78 trails covering nearly of skiable terrain. About two dozen of these are off-piste tree-skiing areas, or Glades, covering approximately .\\"Jay Peak 2012‚Äì2013 Trail Guide\\" , Jay Peak Resort, accessed March 11, 2013 Jay Peak is home to the \\"Face Chutes,\\" arguably the most challenging and steepest marked terrain in the east with an average slope of 56.5 percent (almost 30¬∞) and a maximum slope of 73.9 percent (37¬∞). The \\"Face Chutes\\" consist of four skiable lines, the most challenging being the 3 lines to skier's right, all of which are extremely narrow and include a mandatory cliff drop. Jay Peak is currently serviced by eight lifts: 1 aerial tramway, 3 quads, 1 triple, 1 double and 2 magic carpets. These lifts give the mountain an uphill capacity of approximately 12,000 skiers/hour. The oldest of these lifts, the 60-person aerial tramway, also known as the \\"tram\\", is the only one of its type in the state of Vermont. This tramway was originally installed in 1966 by Von Roll, and upgraded in 2000 with new cabins from Swoboda. In 1985, the resort purchased the Jet Triple chair from Doppelmayr to replace a T-Bar. This was followed in 1987 with the purchase of the Bonaventure Quad which replaced a double chairlift. In 1999 the resort removed the Green Mountain Double chair, which had serviced the north side of the mountain for 30 years, and replaced it with the Green Mountain Flyer (dubbed the \\"Green Mountain Freezer\\" by skiers because of its notoriously cold ride due to the strong winds blowing on it), the mountain's first high-speed detachable chairlift. The other four lifts are shorter and lower on the mountain. In May of 2016 the state raised concerns over the safety of the arial tramway which resulted in $4.5 million worth of electronic upgrades and carriage overhauls of the tramway. The capacity of the two tram cars was reduced to 45 at this time as well. To gain access to the lifts, an RFID system scans a chip embedded in a plastic card which is typically held in the skier's pocket. Snowfall The summit is at an elevation of 3,858 feet (1,176 m), with a 2,015 foot (614 m) vertical drop. Jay Peak has the largest average annual snowfall (355 inches or 9 metres) of any ski area in Eastern North America. In 2000-2001, the resort reported of snowfall. In 2007‚Äì2008, the resort reported of snowfall. Between 2008 and 2014, the resort averaged of snowfall annually. Other facilities The resort has two base lodges and a small lodge at the summit where the aerial tram terminates. There are also hotel facilities and a large number of ski-in/ski-out condominium units on the lower part of the mountain. There is a league-sized hockey rink, the Ice Haus, with room for 700 spectators. Next to it is a 220 space parking garage, where 80% of the slots are covered. In 2011, an indoor water park named The Pump House opened. It features the longest \\"lazy river\\" in Vermont.  EB-5 Fraud  On April 14, 2016 Jay Peak and a commonly owned mountain, Burke Mountain Ski Area (QBurke), were seized by US government officials amid securities fraud complaints. The resort's liquidity issues were resolved, and the resort remains operational under management of the SEC designated receiver. On January 15, 2019, the receiver announced that the resort has been offered for sale.

Hamilton, the first book in The Night's Dawn Trilogy. It is followed by The Neutronium Alchemist and The Naked God. It was first published in the United Kingdom by Macmillan Publishers on 26 January 1996. The first US edition, which was broken into two volumes, Emergence and Expansion (the UK paperback is not), followed in July and August 1997 from Time Warner Books. The second US edition, published by Orbit Books in October 2008, is published in a single volume. In some countries, the paperback editions were split into two (Germany and the United States), three (France) or four volumes (Italy and Portugal) per book. Usually the first volume is a translation of \\"Emergence\\". Background The novel is set in the 26th and 27th centuries. The opening chapters cover a period of some thirty years, with the bulk of the story set in the years 2610 and 2611 AD. A timeline in the appendix briskly covers the future history of the human race, from the settling of the Moon and the opening up of space to commercial exploitation to the founding of the Confederation. Essentially, humanity has split into two strands, the Adamists and Edenists. The Edenists possess the affinity gene, which allows telepathic communication between one another and the construction and use of bio- technological (or 'bitek') constructs, including sentient, living starships (voidhawks) and enormous space habitats. The Edenists have a much greater standard of living than their Adamist counterparts. The Adamists are 'classic' humans who employ mechanical and cybernetic technology and use implants (including 'neural nanonics', essentially computer systems built into the brain which allow anything from enhanced memory and entertainment access to controlling starships) to achieve their ends. The Adamists reject bitek for religious and cultural reasons, but it is later revealed that certain individuals working within Earth's government have discouraged the use of bitek for fear of losing their ability to influence the development of mankind. Some Adamists still use bitek, such as 'blackhawks', advanced living spacecraft similar to Edenist voidhawks but with enhanced combat capabilities. The Adamists are divided into numerous nation-states. The largest and most populous is Govcentral, an amalgamation of Earth's former countries and its orbital ring of 974 large asteroid settlements known as the O'Neill Halo, with their (official) combined population of roughly forty billion. By this time Earth has been ravaged by global warming, with the destruction of the ozone layer, the cessation of ocean currents and the near-poisoning of the surface by carbon dioxide forcing humanity to retreat within vast domed cities known as arcologies. Huge 'armada storms' continuously batter the cities of Earth. Other notable states include the monarchist Kulu Kingdom, the communist Moon- Mars alliance, the Oshanko Imperium, New Washington, New California and Srinagar. The Edenists inhabit sentient habitats orbiting gas giants, which they mine for helium-3, the driving force of the Edenist economy. Helium-3 is necessary in the fusion reactors that provide energy for virtually all electric systems, including the energy patterning nodes essential to the interstellar ZTT (zero-temporal transit) drive. There are 8,310 habitats in existence, 4,250 of them in orbit around Jupiter and 268 around Saturn. The Jovian Consensus is the second most populous member-state of the Confederation, with more than nine billion inhabitants, but has by far the highest standard of living. Despite their cultural, ideological and religious differences (Edenists are virtually all atheists), the Edenists and Adamists generally work together in a forum known as the Confederation, which seeks to regulate interstellar trade, prevent war and repress the use and spread of antimatter, the most feared weapon of mass destruction at the time of the novels. As of 2610 there are 862 planets and 12,370 independent asteroid settlements in the Confederation. Humanity has only encountered three extraterrestrial races: the Jiciro, a race in the stages of an Industrial Revolution that the Confederation is observing discreetly; the Tyrathca, an insectoid species fleeing the destruction of their homeworld through a nova; and the Kiint, an incredibly advanced, ancient species who adopt a slightly condescending policy of non-interference in human affairs, but occasionally help with scientific research in areas of mutual interest. The Kiint only occupy one planet and do not possess starships, claiming to have passed beyond the need for economics and now exist purely to learn more about the universe. The Confederation has also found the ruins of a race known as the Laymil who apparently committed racial suicide some two thousand years prior to the start of the novels, for reasons unknown. Plot summary The Reality Dysfunction opens in the year 2581 with a war raging between two worlds, Omuta and Garissa, over three hundred and eighty seven mineral-rich asteroids known as the Dorados. The war escalates in a matter of months and it is rumoured that Garissa has developed an ultimate weapon of mass destruction known only as 'The Alchemist'. The Alchemist deployment mission, on the starship Beezling and its two escorts, is intercepted by blackhawk mercenaries. Two of the ships survive, although they are crippled and stranded far from the nearest system. Dr. Alkad Mzu, creator of the Alchemist, survives the attack. Shortly after, the Omutans drop fifteen antimatter planet-busters on Garissa, rendering the planet uninhabitable and killing the majority of the ninety-five million inhabitants. The Confederation imposes a 30-year blockade around Omuta, and executes its government. Many millions of years earlier, the extremely rare conditions on a moon orbiting a gas giant in a remote galaxy allow for the creation of a lifeform able to 'transcend' to a purely energy-based (later known as energistic) state, the Ly-Cilph. The Ly-cilph become explorers of the universe, determined to know all that can be known about space and time. Over the course of aeons, they explore the universe and, presently, one arrives in the Milky Way galaxy. An Edenist voidhawk named Iasius returns home to Saturn to die. As is traditional, a mating flight is called, with many voidhawks and even a blackhawk, Udat, joining Iasius on its final voyage into Saturn's atmosphere. As it descends, the other ships energise its bitek eggs, which are taken to nest in Saturn's rings. After several months, when the eggs are large enough, the infant children of Iasius' captain, Athene, are placed within them, so ship and captain experience infancy together, forming an unbreakable bond of love. The ship that grows from the egg energised by Udat, Oenone, becomes the most notable of the new brood of voidhawks, and its captain, Syrinx, the most wilful. As with many Edenists, Syrinx and Oenone volunteer to serve a tour of duty with the Confederation Navy, but the destruction of their fellow ship Graeae (commanded by Syrinx's brother, Thetis) by an Adamist starship (called the Dymasio) using antimatter causes Syrinx to take a dim view of Adamists in general from that point on. She finishes her service with the Navy and then goes into cargo shipping. A group of colonists arrive on the frontier world of Lalonde from Earth. Grossly overpopulated, with tens, sometimes hundreds of millions of people crammed into domed cities called arcologies, many people on Earth dream of escaping to virgin worlds with open skies above their heads. However, Lalonde is a typical stage-one colony world, dirty and corrupt with a ridiculously low level of technology. The latest colonists, mostly from Earth's European arcologies, vow to create a peaceful, safe society. They are taken by steamboat up the mighty Juliffe River to found their new township, which they name Aberdale. Among the colonists are the Skibbow family, whose patriarch, Gerald, is excited about the prospect of living as a farmer. His teenage daughter, Marie, is less impressed and vows to escape back to Earth at the first opportunity. Also among the colonists are Father Horst Elwes, a Christian priest, and a large number of 'Ivets' (Involuntary Transportees), petty criminals from Earth sentenced to work on the colony worlds to repay their debt to society. Unbeknown to the authorities, one of the Ivets, Quinn Dexter, is a member of the Light Brother sect (devil worshippers) and is armed with highly advanced information implants which have escaped detection. Dexter soon exerts his command over all the other Ivets through the use of satanic rituals, whilst simultaneously ingratiating himself with the colonists. His act does not fool Powel Manani, the town's assigned settlement supervisor. Around this time the Ly-cilph arrives on Lalonde and studies Aberdale. Its curiosity is piqued when Father Elwes manages to see it, since few species are capable of perceiving it. Joshua Calvert is a resident of Tranquillity, an independent bitek habitat (one of only five such habitats) orbiting the gas giant Mirchusko. Tranquillity was founded to study the Ruin Ring, the remains of some forty thousand alien habitats which apparently self-destructed two thousand years ago. It was created by the strictly Christian Kulu Kingdom, but when its founder Prince Michael Saldana chose to also accept affinity gene implants and have them inherited by his children, Tranquillity was excommunicated by the Kingdom and its leaders disinherited. Since then it has flourished as a tax haven, a trustworthy base for blackhawk mating flights, and an exclusive business locale in its area of the Confederation. Calvert has inherited a trader starship, the Lady MacBeth, from his late father, but the ship was heavily damaged in an unknown incident (Calvert makes up several stories during the course of the novel to explain this incident, all false; the incident is later explained in the short story 'Escape Route' in the short story collection A Second Chance at Eden) and is no longer operational. Calvert dreams of making a big find in the Ruin Ring to finance repairs. Much to his surprise, Calvert indeed strikes lucky, finding a virtually intact memory core with the first-ever images of the reason for the Laymil racial suicide. However, decoding the information will take some time. Calvert sells his find for nearly seven million six hundred thousand fuseodollars, fixes up the Lady MacBeth and begins his life as a trader captain. He also starts a relationship with Ione Saldana, the current ruler of Tranquillity. Also on Tranquillity is Dr. Alkad Mzu, who has been imprisoned on the habitat for nearly thirty years. How she escaped the situation at the start of the novel is not explained. Mzu is kept under the watchful eye of half a dozen major Confederation intelligence agencies to ensure that her knowledge of the Alchemist is not revealed to anyone else. From time to time, Mzu asks ship captains for passage off the habitat, knowing that such requests will be vetoed by Ione Saldana. She asks both Calvert and Meyer, the captain of the Udat, for aid but both times they refuse to help after Saldana intervenes. On Lalonde Dexter encounters a group of people hiding in the jungle, led by the authoritative Laton. Laton is a 'Serpent', an Edenist who has rejected his society and, for lack of a better term, 'gone bad'. More than thirty-five years ago Laton tried to stage a coup to seize control of a habitat called Jantrit, using a proteanic virus to threaten it with destruction. In the resulting chaos the habitat was destroyed (the only Edenist habitat ever lost) with more than a million deaths. The Confederation Navy believed it had killed Laton, but Laton had evaded capture and fled into obscurity in the wilds of Lalonde. Laton, impressed with Dexter's resourcefulness (but disgusted by his religion), offers him a place in his organisation, whose goal is the discovery of true immortality. Dexter pretends to agree, knowing refusal will mean death. Realising that Dexter is faking his interest, Laton arranges for the villagers to discover that the Ivets are satanists. In the resulting chaos most of Dexter's followers are killed. The remaining few take Powel Manani prisoner and sacrifice him in a grisly ceremony. At this moment, the observing Ly-cilph detects a strange energy current streaming from Manani through a quantum fracture in the space-time continuum. The Ly-cilph attempts to investigate by following the energy current, only to find it flooding into an energistic vacuum. Unable to extricate itself, the Ly-cilph goes into hibernation whilst still halfway between the two dimensions. This allows the strange energy forms in the dimension beyond to cross back into our universe. The result is utter mayhem. Several of the strange entities seize control of Dexter and his followers, in effect 'possessing' them. Able to call upon powers from the other realm, such as the ability to control and alter matter and hurl powerful white fireballs around, they then seize control of Aberdale and Laton's compound, forcing the inhabitants to accept possession or death. Father Elwes escapes onto the savannah with most of Aberdale's children, but not before one of the possessed reveals a terrible secret: the possessing entities are the souls of humans who have died and been trapped, some of them for millennia, in an absolute void where the only way to pass the time is to parasitically feed on the memories and experiences of others. And there are billions of them in the darkness still screaming for escape. At the moment Laton is possessed, he manages to generate a tremendously powerful affinity SOS. This reaches the only two Edenists on the planet, a pair of agents from the Edenist Intelligence agency. They travel upriver to investigate, but are neutralised by the possessed. They manage to alert Ralph Hiltch (the Kulu External Security Agency's Lalonde head of station) and Kelven Solanki (from Confederation Navy Intelligence) to the threat, although not its nature. With the subversion spreading across the planet, the governor authorises the recruitment of mercenaries to put down what he perceives as an 'Ivet uprising'. Unbeknown to the governor, several possessed have already infiltrated the capital, Durringham, and taken passage on ships bound for other worlds. One of these ships is the Lady MacBeth. Calvert has hit on the idea of transporting Lalonde's legendarily tough wood (called Mayope) to the pastoral planet of Norfolk, which has banned all high technology. The idea sounds crazy, but it gets around Norfolk's ban on high-tech items and gives Calvert access to the planet's lucrative market in 'Norfolk Tears', the most desired alcoholic beverage in the galaxy. Calvert also begins a relationship with Louise Kavanagh, the young and naive daughter of Joshua's business partner, Grant. Although Calvert treats the relationship as a bit of fun, Louise falls in love with Joshua and, due to her planet's lack of chemical contraceptive, falls pregnant shortly after he leaves. Unfortunately for Norfolk, Calvert's passenger on the flight from Lalonde was a man called Quinn Dexter. Syrinx and Oenone arrive at Atlantis, the only planet colonised by Edenists (and unsurprisingly, entirely covered in a vast planet-ranging ocean), to purchase seafood to transport to Norfolk to trade for their Tears. During the stay at Pernik Island, Syrinx develops a relationship with an Edenist by the name of Mosul, the son of the family patriarch and guardian of the family fishing business. Mosul and Syrinx develop a contract which includes Syrinx's return to distribute ten percent of Syrinx's stock to the inhabitants of Pernik Island. However, the possessed have infiltrated Atlantis, led by the possessed Laton. They have taken control of Pernik Island and plan to possess Syrinx in the hope of possessing Oenone as well. Syrinx is captured and tortured as a prelude to possession. The plot backfires when Laton, having taken the time to study his possessing soul, manages to gain access to Pernik Island. He saves Syrinx, allows the crew of Oenone to rescue her (and gives them a message to take to Jupiter), and then causes the island to self-destruct, killing all of the possessed on it. Laton's departure from Lalonde was observed by a reporter. Within days half the Confederation knows that the most infamous Serpent of them all has returned, and a Confederation- wide quarantine to prevent the spread of Laton and his proteanic virus is enacted. On Tranquillity data from the Laymil information stack reveals that their homeworld in the Mirchusko system (which does not seem to exist any more) was taken over by a 'reality dysfunction', triggered by the 'Galheith research death essence tragedy'. The data shows the Laymil homeworld being overrun by a red cloud of unknown origin. On Lalonde the possessed close to within a few hundred kilometres of Durringham. As they advance, a strange red cloud starts forming above centres of possessed activity. Ralph Hiltch and Kelven Solanki evacuate their respective personnel from the planet. Hiltch's team manage to capture a possessed before they leave (this possessed is controlling the body of Gerald Skibbow of Aberdale) Solanki's report reaches the Confederation Navy, which swiftly organises a fleet to quarantine Lalonde. On Norfolk Quinn Dexter manages to reassert control of his body, by feeding his possessor images of his depraved activities as a satanist to the point where the possessor starts behaving like Dexter and then retreats into a catatonic state. Enhanced with his ex-possessor's energistic power, Dexter swiftly organises the possessed and they rapidly start taking over the planet. Several more possessed reach the independent bitek habitat Valisk in the Srinagar system and begin possessing several inhabitants as a prelude to taking over the entire habitat. They are led by Kiera, who has possessed the body of Marie Skibbow from Aberdale. Dariat, one of the children of Rubra, the eccentric genius who founded Valisk and then transferred his personality into it upon his death, becomes aware of their activities and volunteers to help them, so he can revenge himself upon the manipulative Rubra. His knowledge of the habitat's surveillance techniques and how to evade them proves invaluable to the possessed. They kill him, and then guide his soul into a new body to give him the same powers they possess. The Kulu embassy staff reach Ombey, the nearest Kulu colony world to Lalonde. However, when they bring their possessed prisoner out of zero-tau (a form of suspension which reduces energy movements to zero, effectively freezing time), they find the possessing spirit has fled, leaving the traumatised, broken form of Gerald Skibbow within. Princess Kirsten Saldana, the Saldana family member responsible for Ombey, is rapidly forced to declare a state of emergency when it is revealed that three personnel from the embassy staff were possessed and have begun spreading across the planet. Ralph Hiltch is brought in to advise. The Lady MacBeth reaches Tranquillity at the same time that representatives of the Lalonde government are forming a mercenary fleet and army to save the planet. Keen to protect his investment, Calvert volunteers to accompany the fleet. They reach Lalonde (of which a sizable portion is covered by a strange red cloud) and begin landing mercenaries on the surface, but many of the landing teams are rapidly possessed and return to the orbiting ships. A full-scale space battle erupts when the Confederation Navy squadron arrives to blockade the planet and the possessed ships start firing on them. The mercenary team from the Lady MacBeth evades possession and manage to take a prisoner whose possessor is called Shaun Wallace, who tells them that the red cloud will hide Lalonde from the universe. He reveals that the possessed can hear the cries for help from the possessed still in 'the beyond' and they desperately need to escape them. Once the cloud encircles Lalonde completely, the combined will of the possessed can physically move the planet onto another plane of existence where the cries of the possessed will not reach them. The mercenary team evacuates to a nearby settlement belonging to the alien Tyrathca. The xenocs are extremely agitated by the human's newly revealed ability to become 'elemental' as they call it. They have built a statue to their 'Sleeping God', which 'sees the universe' and they believe will save them. A reporter accompanying the mission, Kelly Tirrel, takes images of the statue and notes that there is no record of the Tyrathca having a god due to their highly unimaginative nature. They move on and discover Father Elwes and the children from Aberdale in hiding on the savannah. They manage to arrange a pick-up from the Lady MacBeth. The mercenary team sacrifices itself against an attack by possessed masquerading as the stereotypical knights in shining armour in order to give the children, Elwes and Kelly, time to evacuate. A message hidden in the request for aid given by Alkad Mzu to Captain Meyer of the Udat is revealed, offering him a vast sum of money for his help in aiding her escape. Meyer agrees and has Udat make a wormhole jump into the interior of Tranquillity. Mzu arranges to be in place for a pick-up, but underestimates the ability and sheer power of Tranquillity to enforce its will through affinity. Udat is compelled to jump back out with Mzu perilously hanging onto a rope ladder trailing from the blackhawk. The story continues in The Neutronium Alchemist. Reception Cliff Ramshaw reviewed The Reality Dysfunction for Arcane magazine, rating it an 8 out of 10 overall. Ramshaw comments that \\"Hamilton's wide scope and weak characters mean that the initial stages of the novel flounder. It isn't until after page 200 or so that the plot begins to take shape; after page 300 things are motoring along at a more than acceptable rate. Towards the end the epic scale really pays off: the tension mounts and mounts as a wide array of human forces, hampered by ignorance and communication failures, attempts to halt an invasion on a colony world seemingly without strategic value.\\"  References  *  External links  *Official Peter F.

Johann Conrad Dippel, also spelled Johann Konrad Dippel (10 August 1673 ‚Äì 25 April 1734), was a German pietist theologian, physician, alchemist and occultist.  Life  Dippel was born at Castle Frankenstein near M√ºhltal and Darmstadt, and therefore once at his school the addendum Franckensteinensis and once at his university the addendum Franckensteina- Strataemontanus was used. He studied theology, philosophy and alchemy at the University of Giessen, obtaining a master's degree in theology in 1693. He published many theological works under the name Christianus Dem√≥critus, and most of them are still preserved. Circa 1700, he turned to Hermetic studies and alchemy as a key to nature. Between 1700 and 1702, he engaged in a bitter dispute with the Reformed Court Preacher Conrad Broeske in Offenbach, with whom he shared millenarian hopes for soon-coming renewal in Christendom. He accused Broeske of compromise and collusion with the authorities after Broeske refused to publish Dippel's \\"The Scourging Papacy of the Protestants\\" on the Offenbach press. Dippel's reputation as a controversial theologian earned him both defenders and enemies throughout all of Europe. Emanuel Swedenborg was probably both his most notable supporter and, later, staunch critic: Swedenborg began as a disciple of Dippel, but eventually dismissed him as a \\"most vile devil ... who attempted wicked things\\". Swedenborg clarified that he was at first enamored by Dippel's emotionally charged writings and agreed with his attempts to dissolve traditional churches for a more personal faith and rejection of the Bible as the literal Word of God; however, he eventually criticized Dippel as \\"bound to no principles, but was in general opposed to all, whoever they may be, of whatever principle or faith ... becoming angry with any one for contradicting him\\". Swedenborg went so far as to suggest that Dippel was merely a cultish opportunist who used his theological charisma for his own financial gain and social influence, actively leading people away from traditional faith in order to \\"take away all their intelligence of truth and good, and leaving them in a kind of delirium.\\"Swedenborg, Emanuel. A compendium of the theological and spiritual writings of Emanuel Swedenborg (1854) pp. 418‚Äì420 Dippel led an adventurous life, often getting into trouble because of his disputed opinions and his problems with managing money. He was eventually imprisoned for heresy, where he served a seven-year sentence. He created an animal oil known as \\"Dippel's oil\\", which was supposed to be the equivalent to the alchemists' dream of the \\"elixir of life\\". At one point, Dippel attempted to purchase Castle Frankenstein in exchange for his elixir formula, which he claimed he had recently discovered; the offer was turned down.Gothic Immortals: The Fiction of the Brotherhood of the Rosy Cross by Marie Roberts contains a translation of a letter Dippel wrote in which he requested to be the lord of Castle Frankenstein in exchange for the Elixir of Life. According to Stahl, Dippel and the pigment maker Diesbach used potassium carbonate contaminated with this oil in producing red dyes. To their surprise, they obtained a blue pigment \\"Berliner Blau\\", also called \\"Preussisch Blau\\" or \\"Prussian blue\\".Stahl, Georg Ernst: Experimenta, Observationes, Animadversiones, CCC Numero, Chymicae et Physicae, Berlin 1731, 281‚Äì283. There are claims that during his stay at Castle Frankenstein, he practiced alchemy and anatomy. He was allegedly working with nitroglycerin, which led to the destruction of a tower at the Castle Frankenstein. But this seems to be a modern myth, for it is an anachronism. Nitroglycerin hadn't been discovered in Dippel's time. And although the history of the castle during Dippel's lifetime is well documented, the destruction of a tower ‚Äì though surely a remarkable event ‚Äì is nowhere mentioned. Other rumours about Dippel appear to be modern inventions, too. For example, that which said he performed experiments with cadavers, in which he attempted to transfer the soul of one cadaver into another. Soul-transference with cadavers was a common experiment among alchemists at the time and was a theory that Dippel supported in his writings, thus making it possible that Dippel pursued similar objectives,Eric John Holmyard, Alchemy. Dover Publications, 1990 but there is no direct evidence to link him to these specific acts. There is also no evidence to the rumour that he was driven out of town when word of his activities reached the ears of the townspeople ‚Äî though he was often banned from countries, notably Sweden and Russia, for his controversial theological positions. He also eventually had to flee to Giessen after killing a man in a duel. Dippel did, however, experiment quite frequently with dead animals, of which he was an \\"avid dissector\\".Jared Christman. Grave Pawns. 2010, p. 48 In his dissertation Maladies and Remedies of the Life of the Flesh, Dippel claims to have discovered both the elixir of life and the means to exorcize demons through potions that he concocted from boiled animal bones and flesh. This is the same essay in which Dippel claimed to believe that souls could be transferred from one corpse to another by using a funnel.Johann Konrad Dippel (writing as Christianus Democritus). Maladies and Remedies of the Life of the Flesh. Originally published in German in 1736 Some of Dippel's contemporaries, notably Johann Heinrich Jung, believed that toward the end of his life, Dippel lost his faith altogether after years of bitter disputes with other Christian leaders. Calling Christ \\"an indifferent being\\",Jung, Johann Heinrich. Theobald, or the Fanatic (1835), pp. 25‚Äì28 Dippel shifted all of his energy exclusively on his alchemical experiments. He set up a lab near Wittgenstein (which was eventually converted into a pub named after him, DippelshofThe pub's official website: http://www.dippelshof.de/), and at this point in his life historical records are vague on his activities and thus grew folkloric in nature.Florescu, Radu. In Search of Frankenstein. New York, NY: New York Graphic Society, 1975 . During this time, at least one local minister apparently accused Dippel of grave-robbing, experimenting on cadavers, and keeping company with the Devil.‚ÄúFrankenstein's castle offers Halloween chills.‚Äù Today. MSNBC Travel, 28 October 2008 For the most part, Dippel kept to himself and his work; he perhaps even actively perpetuated the rumours that he had sold his soul to the Devil in exchange for secret knowledge, as relying on his reputation as a dark sorcerer better enabled him to find audiences with those willing to pay for his knowledge of the philosopher's stone and the elixir of life.Curran, Bob. Man-Made Monsters (2010). p. 45 He died at Castle Wittgenstein near Bad Laasphe, probably from a stroke, though some contemporaries suspected poisoning. A year before his death, he wrote a pamphlet in which he claimed to have discovered an elixir that would keep him alive until the age of 135.  Connection to the novel Frankenstein  Dippel's connection to the Castle Frankenstein gave rise to the theory that he was a model for Mary Shelley's 1818 novel Frankenstein; or, The Modern Prometheus, although that idea remains controversial. This hypothesis was probably first suggested by Radu Florescu in his book In Search of Frankenstein (1975), which speculated that Shelley (then Mary Wollstonecraft) visited the castle during her travels on the Rhine with Percy Shelley, where they might have heard local stories about Dippel, which by then would have grown legendary and notorious. Florescu also notes that the Shelleys reference a brief interaction while touring the countryside around Castle Frankenstein with students of the University of Strasbourg, of which Dippel was once a student; these students could have told them stories about the infamous alumnus. In addition, the Shelleys knew several members of the so-called \\"Kreis der Empfindsamen\\", a literary circle that met in Darmstadt from 1769 to 1773; Castle Frankenstein was frequently used as a location for their public readings, thus making it possible that Dippel's legends could have come up during conversations between those in the circle and the Shelleys. A local historian, Walter Scheele, believes that the legends told in the villages surrounding the castle were transmitted by Jacob Grimm to Mary Jane Clairmont, translator of Grimm's fairy tales and stepmother of Mary Wollstonecraft Godwin. Scheele also claims that, in 1814, Mary, her half- sister Claire Clairmont, and Percy Bysshe Shelley are said to have visited Castle Frankenstein, on their way to Lake Geneva. Other historians, whether their field of research is Grimm, Shelley, or the Castle Frankenstein, do not see any evidence for this. Scheele's claimed letter of Grimm is nowhere to be found. And no evidence can be found that Clairmont was considered the translator for Grimm's Fairy Tales.Mary Shelley‚Äôs Frankenstein, Castle Frankenstein and the alchemist Johann Conrad Dippel Regardless of the historical validity of the connection, however, Dippel's status as Frankenstein's prototype seems assured in current popular culture (similar to Count Dracula's equally controversial interchangeability with the historical Vlad the Impaler\\"Filing for Divorce: Count Dracula vs Vlad Tepes\\" (from \\"Dracula: The Shade and the Shadow\\", ed. Elizabeth Miller, Westcliff-on-Sea: Desert Island Books, 1998)). In addition to Florescu's speculative work, the Dippel/Frankenstein merging has appeared in several works of fiction: Robert Anton Wilson's fantasy novel The Earth Will Shake features Dippel as a monster-making, globe-hopping magician who calls himself Frankenstein;Wilson, Robert Anton. The Earth Will Shake: The History of the Early Illuminati. New Falcon Publications, 1982 the science fiction novel The Frankenstein Murders portrays Dippel as an assistant to Victor Frankenstein;Bradshaw, Kathlyn. The Frankenstein Murders.

Back Bay Books; August 20, 2007Garrett, Martin. Mary Shelley. Oxford University Press, 2002 In particular, Miranda Seymour finds it curious that Mary speaks of \\"gods [making entirely] new men\\" in her journal so soon after her travels through the regions surrounding Castle Frankenstein;Seymour, Miranda. Mary Shelley. Atlanta, GA: Grove Press, 2002. pp. 110‚Äì111 if rumors indeed existed throughout the area that Dippel experimented on cadavers in an attempt to create life, Seymour argues, Mary's phrasing could be more than merely coincidental. In his book Frankenstein: The First 200 Years, Christopher Frayling refers to a passage in Mary's diaries later in her life in which she expresses a desire to return to the region surrounding Castle Frankenstein to take in more of its folklore‚Äîimplying that she is already familiar with at least some of the local legends.Frayling, Christopher. Frankenstein: The First Two Hundred Years. Reel Art Press, 2018. For now, however, the connection remains a subject of an ongoing debate.Fantasmagoriana (Tales of The Dead), edited and translated by A. J. Day. Fantasmagoriana Press, 2005 In popular culture Johann Dippel is mentioned as the teacher of one of the characters in season 1, chapter 6, \\"Lost and Found\\", of TV series The Frankenstein Chronicles (Benjamin Ross and Barry Langford, 2015). In season 2, Laurence Fox plays Dippel's son, who is also involved in resurrections, though he is not mentioned as having met the Shelleys. Dippel appears as a minor character in Larry Correia's Monster Hunter series of novels as Konrad Dippel. There, he is credited with the creation of the Frankenstein monster, and contrary to Mary Shelley's novel, he is also credited with teaching the monster human mannerisms, as well as the German language.

The earliest conflicts began during the Byzantine‚ÄìOttoman wars, waged in Anatolia in the late 13th century before entering Europe in the mid 14th century, followed by the Bulgarian‚ÄìOttoman wars and the Serbian‚ÄìOttoman wars waged beginning in the mid 14th century. Much of this period was characterized by Ottoman expansion into the Balkans. The Ottoman Empire made further inroads into Central Europe in the 15th and 16th centuries, culminating in the peak of Ottoman territorial claims in Europe.Alexander Lyon Macfie, The Eastern Question 1774-1923 (2nd ed 1996).L.S. Stavrianos, The Balkans since 1453 (1958) The Ottoman‚ÄìVenetian Wars spanned four centuries, starting in 1423 and lasting until 1718. This period witnessed the fall of Negroponte in 1470, the fall of Famagusta (Cyprus) in 1571, the defeat of the Ottoman fleet at the Battle of Lepanto in 1571 (at that time the largest naval battle in history), the fall of Candia (Crete) in 1669, the Venetian reconquest of Morea (Peloponnese) in the 1680s and its loss again in 1715. The island of Corfu under Venetian rule remained the only Greek island not conquered by the Ottomans.Kakissis, Joanna, Athens & the Islands, (National Geographic Society, 2011), p. 224. In the late seventeenth century, European powers began to consolidate against the Ottomans and formed the Holy League, reversing a number of Ottoman land gains during the Great Turkish War of 1683‚Äì99. Nevertheless, Ottoman armies were able to hold their own against their European rivals until the second half of the eighteenth century. * In the nineteenth century the Ottomans were confronted with insurrection from their Serbian (1804‚Äì1817) and Greek (1821‚Äì1832) subjects. This occurred in tandem with the Russo-Turkish wars, which further destabilized the empire. The final retreat of Ottoman rule came with the First Balkan War (1912‚Äì1913), followed by the signing of the Treaty of S√®vres at the close of World War I.  Rise of the Ottomans (1299‚Äì1453)  =Byzantine Empire= Conquest of Constantinople by Sultan Mehmed the Conqueror in 1453 After striking a blow to the weakened Byzantine Empire in 1356 (or in 1358 - disputable due to a change in the Byzantine calendar), (see S√ºleyman Pasha) which provided it with Gallipoli as a basis for operations in Europe, the Ottoman Empire started its westward expansion into the European continent in the middle of the 14th century. Constantinople fell in 1453 after the Battle of Varna (1444) and the Second Battle of Kosovo (1448). The remaining Greek states fell in 1461 (Despotate of the Morea and Empire of Trebizond) (see: Ottoman Greece). =Bulgarian Empire= In the latter half of the 14th century, the Ottoman Empire proceeded to advance north and west in the Balkans, completely subordinating Thrace and much of Macedonia after the Battle of Maritsa in 1371. Sofia fell in 1382, followed by the capital of the Second Bulgarian Empire Tarnovgrad in 1393, and the northwest remnants of the state after the Battle of Nicopolis in 1396. =Serbian Empire= A significant opponent of the Ottomans, the young Serbian Empire, was worn down by a series of campaigns, notably in the Battle of Kosovo in 1389, in which the leaders of both armies were killed, and which gained a central role in Serbian folklore as an epic battle and as the beginning of the end for medieval Serbia. Much of Serbia fell to the Ottomans by 1459, the Kingdom of Hungary made a partial reconquest in 1480, but it fell again by 1499. Territories of Serbian Empire were divided between Ottoman Empire, the Republic of Venice and the Kingdom of Hungary, with remaining territories being in some sort of a vassal status towards Hungary, until its own conquest.  Growth (1453‚Äì1683)  The defeat in 1456 at the Siege of N√°ndorfeh√©rv√°r (Belgrade) held up Ottoman expansion into Catholic Europe for 70 years, though for one year (1480‚Äì1481) the Italian port of Otranto was taken, and in 1493 the Ottoman army successfully raided Croatia and Styria. =Wars in Albania and Italy= Albanian assault on a Turkish encampment in 1457 The Ottomans took much of Albania in the 1385 Battle of Savra. The 1444 League of Lezh√´ briefly restored one part of Albania, until Ottomans captured complete territory of Albania after capture of Shkod√´r in 1479 and Durr√´s in 1501. The Ottomans faced the fiercest resistance from Albanians who gathered around their leader, George Castriot, son of a feudal nobleman, and managed to fend off Ottoman attacks for more than 25 years, culminating at the siege of Shkodra in 1478‚Äì79. It has been argued that Albanian resilience halted the Ottoman advance along the Eastern flank of the Western Civilization, saving the Italian peninsula from Ottoman conquest. Merely two years after the collapse of the Albanian resistance, Sultan Mehmet II launched an Italian campaign, which failed thanks to Christian recapture of Otranto and Sultan's death in 1481. =Conquest of Bosnia= The Ottoman Empire first reached Bosnia in 1388 where they were defeated by Bosnian forces in the Battle of Bileƒáa and then were forced to retreat.Finkel, Caroline, Osman's Dream, (Basic Books, 2004), 20. After the fall of Serbia in 1389 Battle of Kosovo, where the Bosnians participated through Vlatko Vukoviƒá, the Turks began various offensives against the Kingdom of Bosnia. The Bosnians defended themselves but without much success. The Bosnians resisted strongly in the Bosnian Royal castle of Jajce (the siege of Jajce), where the last Bosnian king Stjepan Toma≈°eviƒá tried to repel the Turks. The Ottoman army conquered Jajce after a few months in 1463 and executed the last King of Bosnia, ending Medieval Bosnia. The House of Kosaƒça held Herzegovina until 1482. The Ottomans defeated the Hungarian Fortress of Jajce in the year 1527. Bihaƒá and the westernmost areas of Bosnia were finally conquered by the Ottomans in 1592. =Croatia= Croatian captain Petar Kru≈æiƒá led the defense of the Klis Fortress against a Turkish invasion and siege that lasted for more than two and a half decades. During this defense, an elite Croatian military faction of Uskoci was formed. After the fall of the Kingdom of Bosnia into Ottoman hands in 1463, the southern and central parts of the Kingdom of Croatia remained unprotected, the defense of which was left to Croatian gentry who kept smaller troops in the fortified border areas at their own expense. The Ottomans meanwhile reached the river Neretva and, having conquered Herzegovina (Rama) in 1482, they encroached upon Croatia, skillfully avoiding the fortified border towns. A decisive Ottoman victory at the Battle of Krbava Field shook all of Croatia. However, it did not dissuade the Croats from making persistent attempts at defending themselves against the attacks of the superior Ottoman forces. After almost two hundred years of Croatian resistance against the Ottoman Empire, victory in the Battle of Sisak marked the end of Ottoman rule and the Hundred Years' Croatian‚ÄìOttoman War. The Viceroy's army, chasing the fleeing remnants at Petrinja in 1595, sealed the victory. =Conquest of central parts of Hungarian Kingdom= Battle of Moh√°cs in 1526, Ottoman miniature The Kingdom of Hungary, which at the time spanned the area from Croatia in the west to Transylvania in the east, was also gravely threatened by Ottoman advances. The origins of such a deterioration can be traced back to the fall of the √Årp√°d ruling dynasty and their subsequent replacement with the Angevin and Jagiellonian kings. After a series of inconclusive wars over the course of 176 years, the kingdom finally crumbled in the Battle of Moh√°cs of 1526, after which most of it was either conquered or brought under Ottoman suzerainty. (The 150-year Turkish rule, as it is called in Hungary, lasted until the late 17th century but parts of the Hungarian Kingdom were under Ottoman rule from 1421 and until 1718.) =Conquest of Serbia= As a result of heavy losses inflicted by the Ottomans in the Battle of Maritsa in 1371, the Serbian Empire had dissolved into several principalities. In the Battle of Kosovo in 1389, Serbian forces were again annihilated. Throughout the 15th and 16th centuries, constant struggles took place between various Serbian kingdoms and the Ottoman Empire. The turning point was the fall of Constantinople to the Turks. In 1459, following the siege, the temporary Serbian capital of Smederevo fell. Zeta was overrun by 1499. Belgrade was the last major Balkan city to endure Ottoman forces. Serbs, Hungarians, and European crusaders defeated the Turkish army in the Siege of Belgrade in 1456. After repelling Ottoman attacks for over 70 years, Belgrade finally fell in 1521, along with the greater part of the Kingdom of Hungary. The Vojvodina rebellion between 1526 and 1528 led to the proclamation of the Second Serbian Empire in Vojvodina, which was among the last Serbian territories to resist the Ottomans. The Serbian Despotate fell in 1459, thus marking the two-century-long Ottoman conquest of Serbian principalities. = 1463‚Äì1503: Wars with Venice = Ottoman advances resulted in some of the captive Christians being carried deep into Turkish territory The wars with the Republic of Venice began in 1463. A favorable peace treaty was signed in 1479 after the lengthy siege of Shkodra (1478‚Äì79). In 1480, now no longer hampered by the Venetian fleet, the Ottomans besieged Rhodes and captured Otranto.Ottoman Empire on the Offensive, 1300 - 1600 War with Venice resumed from 1499 to 1503. In 1500, a Spanish‚ÄìVenetian army commanded by Gonzalo de C√≥rdoba took Kefalonia, temporarily stopping the Ottoman offensive on eastern Venetian territories. The offensive resumed after the Ottoman victory of Preveza (1538), fought between an Ottoman fleet commanded by Hayreddin Barbarossa and that of a Christian alliance assembled by Pope Paul III. = 1462‚Äì1483: Wallachian and Moldavian campaigns = In 1462, Mehmed II was driven back by Wallachian prince Vlad III Dracula in the Night Attack at T√¢rgovi≈üte. However, the latter was imprisoned by Hungarian king Matthias Corvinus. This caused outrage among many influential Hungarian figures and Western admirers of Vlad's success in the battle against the Ottoman Empire (and his early recognition of the threat it posed), including high-ranking members of the Vatican. Because of this, Matthias granted him the status of distinguished prisoner. Eventually, Dracula was freed in late 1475 and was sent with an army of Hungarian and Serbian soldiers to recover Bosnia from the Ottomans. There he defeated Ottoman forces for the first time. Upon this victory, Ottoman forces entered Wallachia in 1476 under the command of Mehmed II. Vlad was killed and, according to some sources, his head was sent to Constantinople to discourage the other rebellions. (Bosnia was completely added to Ottoman lands in 1482.) The Turkish advance was temporarily halted after Stephen the Great of Moldavia defeated the armies of the Ottoman Sultan Mehmed II at the Battle of Vaslui in 1475, one of the greatest defeats of the Ottoman Empire until that time. Stephen was defeated the next year at RƒÉzboieni (Battle of Valea AlbƒÉ), but the Ottomans had to retreat after they failed to take any significant castle (see Siege of Neam»õ Citadel) as a plague started to spread in the Ottoman army. Stephen's search for European assistance against the Turks met with little success, even though he had \\"cut off the pagan's right-hand\\", as he put it in a letter. = 1526‚Äì1566: Conquest of the Kingdom of Hungary = Ottoman soldiers in the territory of present-day Hungary The Ottoman campaign in Hungary in 1566, Crimean Tatars as vanguard After the Ottoman victory in the Battle of Moh√°cs in 1526, only the southwestern part of the Kingdom of Hungary was actually conquered.The Battle of Mohacs, 1526 The Ottoman campaign continued between 1526 and 1556 with small campaigns and major summer invasions ‚Äì troops would return south of the Balkan Mountains before winter. In 1529, they mounted their first major attack on the Austrian Habsburg Monarchy, attempting to conquer the city of Vienna (Siege of Vienna). In 1532, another attack on Vienna with 60,000 troops in the main army was held up by the small fort (800 defenders) of K≈ëszeg in western Hungary, fighting a suicidal battle.Castles and History in Northern Transdanubia The invading troops were held up until winter was close and the Habsburg Empire had assembled a force of 80,000 at Vienna. The Ottoman troops returned home through Styria, laying waste to the country. In the meantime, in 1538, the Ottoman Empire invaded Moldavia. In 1541, another campaign in Hungary took Buda and Pest (which today together form the Hungarian capital Budapest) with a largely bloodless trick: after concluding peace talks with an agreement, troops stormed the open gates of Buda in the night. In retaliation for a failed Austrian counter-attack in 1542, the conquest of the western half of central Hungary was finished in the 1543 campaign that took both the most important royal ex-capital, Sz√©kesfeh√©rv√°r, and the ex-seat of the cardinal, Esztergom. However, the army of 35‚Äì40,000 men was not enough for Suleiman to mount another attack on Vienna. A temporary truce was signed between the Habsburg and Ottoman Empires in 1547, which was soon disregarded by the Habsburgs. In the major but moderately successful campaign of 1552, two armies took the eastern part of central Hungary, pushing the borders of the Ottoman Empire to the second (inner) line of northern v√©gv√°rs (border castles), which Hungary originally built as defence against an expected second Mongol invasion‚Äîhence, afterwards, borders on this front changed little. For Hungarians, the 1552 campaign was a series of tragic losses and some heroic (but pyrrhic) victories, which entered folklore‚Äîmost notably the fall of Dr√©gely (a small fort defended to the last man by just 146 menHungary - Dr√©gelypal√°nk), and the Siege of Eger. The latter was a major v√©gv√°r with more than 2,000 men, without outside help. They faced two Ottoman armies, which were surprisingly unable to take the castle within five weeks. (The fort was later taken in 1596.) Finally, the 1556 campaign secured Ottoman influence over Transylvania (which had fallen under Habsburg control for a time), while failing to gain any ground on the western front, being tied down in the second (after 1555) unsuccessful siege of the southwestern Hungarian border castle of Szigetv√°r. The Ottoman Empire conducted another major war against the Habsburgs and their Hungarian territories between 1566 and 1568. The 1566 Siege of Szigetv√°r, the third siege in which the fort was finally taken, but the aged Sultan died, deterring that year's push for Vienna. = 1522‚Äì1573: Rhodes, Malta and the Holy League = The siege of Malta ‚Äì Arrival of the Turkish Fleet by Matteo Perez d'Aleccio Ottoman forces invaded and captured the island of Rhodes in 1522, after two previous failed attempts (see Siege of Rhodes).Timeline: 1501 to 1600 The Knights of Saint John were banished to Malta, which was in turn besieged in 1565. After a siege of three months, the Ottoman army failed to control all of the Maltese forts. Delaying the Ottomans until bad weather conditions and the arrival of Sicilian reinforcements, made Ottoman commander Kƒ±zƒ±lahmedli Mustafa Pasha quit the siege. Around 22,000 to 48,000 Ottoman troops against 6,000 to 8,500 Maltese troops, the Ottomans failed to conquer Malta, sustaining more than 25,000 lossesArnold Cassola, The 1565 Great Siege of Malta and Hipolito Sans's La Maltea (Publishers Enterprise Group: Malta, 1999)., including one of the greatest Muslim corsair generals of the time, Dragut, and were repulsed. Had Malta fallen, Sicily and mainland Italy could have fallen under the threat of an Ottoman invasion. The victory of Malta during this event, which is nowadays known as the Great Siege of Malta, turned the tide and gave Europe hopes and motivation. It also marked the importance of the Knights of Saint John and their relevant presence in Malta to aid Christendom in its defence against the Muslim conquest. The Ottoman naval victories of this period were in the Battle of Preveza (1538) and the Battle of Djerba (1560). Battle of Lepanto on 7 October 1571 The Mediterranean campaign, which lasted from 1570 to 1573, resulted in the Ottoman conquest of Cyprus. A Holy League of Venice, the Papal States, Spain, the Knights of Saint John in Malta and initially Portugal was formed against the Ottoman Empire during this period. The League's victory in the Battle of Lepanto (1571) briefly ended Ottoman predominance at sea. = 1570‚Äì1571: Conquest of Cyprus = In the summer of 1570, the Turks struck again, but this time with a full-scale invasion rather than a raid. About 60,000 troops, including cavalry and artillery, under the command of Lala Mustafa Pasha landed unopposed near Limassol on July 2, 1570, and laid siege to Nicosia. In an orgy of victory on the day that the city fell‚ÄîSeptember 9, every public building and palace was looted. Word of the superior Ottoman numbers spread, and a few days later Mustafa took Kyrenia without having to fire a shot. Famagusta, however, resisted and put up a defense that lasted from September 1570 until August 1571. The fall of Famagusta marked the beginning of the Ottoman period in Cyprus. Two months later, the naval forces of the Holy League, composed mainly of Venetian, Spanish, and Papal ships under the command of Don John of Austria, defeated the Ottoman fleet at the Battle of Lepanto in one of the decisive battles of world history. The victory over the Turks, however, came too late to help Cyprus, and the island remained under Ottoman rule for the next three centuries. In 1570, the Ottoman Empire first conquered Cyprus, and Lala Mustafa Pasha became the first Ottoman governor of Cyprus, challenging the claims of Venice. Simultaneously, the Pope formed a coalition between the Papal States, Malta, Spain, Venice and several other Italian states, with no real result. In 1573 the Venetians left, removing the influence of the Roman Catholic Church. = 1593‚Äì1669: Austria, Venice and Wallachia = Hondius, just at the end of the Long War, 1606 * Long War (15-year war with Austria, 1593‚Äì1606) ends with status quo. * Michael the Brave campaign against the Ottoman Empire (1593‚Äì1601) * War with Venice 1645‚Äì1669 and the conquest of Crete (see Cretan War (1645‚Äì1669)). * Austro- Turkish War (1663‚Äì1664): failed Ottoman attempt to defeat and invade Austria. = 1620‚Äì1621: Poland-Lithuania = Was fought over Moldavia. The Polish army advanced into Moldavia and was defeated in the Battle of ≈¢u≈£ora. The Next year, the Poles repelled the Turkish invasion in the Battle of Khotyn. Another conflict started in 1633 but was soon settled. = 1657‚Äì1683 Conclusion of wars with Habsburgs = Transylvania, the Eastern part of the former Hungarian Kingdom, gained semi-independence in 1526, while paying tribute to the Ottoman Empire. In 1657, Transylvania felt strong enough to attack the Tatars to the East (then the Empire's vassals), and later the Ottoman Empire itself, which had come to the Tatars' defence. The war lasted until 1662, ending in defeat for the Hungarians. The Western part of the Hungarian Kingdom (Partium) was annexed and placed under direct Ottoman control. At the same time, there was another campaign against Austria between 1663 and 1664. Despite being defeated in the Battle of Saint Gotthard on 1 August 1664 by Raimondo Montecuccoli, the Ottomans secured recognition of their conquest of Nov√© Z√°mky in the Peace of Vasv√°r with Austria, marking the greatest territorial extent of Ottoman rule in the former Hungarian Kingdom.The years 1300 and later = 1672‚Äì1676: Poland-Lithuania = The Polish‚ÄìOttoman War (1672‚Äì1676) ended with the Treaty of ≈ªurawno, in which the Commonwealth ceded control of most of its Ukrainian territories to the empire. = 1683‚Äì1699: Great Turkish War ‚Äì Loss of Hungary and the Morea = Battle of Vienna on 12 September 1683 by Gonzales Franciscus Casteels The Great Turkish War started in 1683, with a grand invasion force of 140,000 men1683 Siege of Vienna marching on Vienna, supported by Protestant Hungarian noblemen rebelling against Habsburg rule. To stop the invasion, another Holy League was formed, composed of Austria and Poland (notably in the Battle of Vienna), Venetians and the Russian Empire, Vienna had been besieged by the Ottoman Empire for two months. The battle marked the first time the Commonwealth and the Holy Roman Empire had cooperated militarily against the Ottomans, and it is often seen as a turning point in history, after which \\"the Ottoman Turks ceased to be a menace to the Christian world\\". In the ensuing war that lasted until 1699, the Ottomans lost almost all of Hungary to the Holy Roman Emperor Leopold I. After winning the Battle of Vienna, the Holy League gained the upper hand and reconquered Hungary (Buda and Pest were retaken in 1686, the former under the command of a Swiss-born convert to Islam). At the same time, the Venetians launched an expedition into Greece, which conquered the Peloponnese. During the 1687 Venetian attack on the city of Athens (conquered by the Ottomans), the Ottomans turned the ancient Parthenon into an ammunitions storehouse. A Venetian mortar hit the Parthenon, detonating the Ottoman gunpowder stored inside and partially destroying it.Theodor E. Mommsen, The Venetians in Athens and the Destruction of the Parthenon in 1687, American Journal of Archaeology, Vol. 45, No. 4 (October ‚Äì December 1941), pp. 544‚Äì556 The war ended with the Treaty of Karlowitz in 1699. Prince Eugene of Savoy first distinguished himself in 1683 and remained the most important Austrian commander until 1718.Habsburg-Ottoman War, 1683‚Äì1699Decline of Islamaic and Ottoman Power  Stagnation (1699‚Äì1828)  = 18th century = Austrian conquest of Belgrade: 1717 by Eugene of Savoy, during the Austro-Turkish War (1716‚Äì1718) The second Russo-Turkish War took place 1710‚Äì1711 near Prut. It was instigated by Charles XII of Sweden after the defeat at the Battle of Poltava, in order to tie down Russia with the Ottoman Empire and gain some breathing space in the increasingly unsuccessful Great Northern War. The Russians were severely beaten but not annihilated, and after the Treaty of Prut was signed the Ottoman Empire disengaged, allowing Russia to refocus its energies on the defeat of Sweden. The Ottoman‚ÄìVenetian War started in 1714. It overlapped with the Austro- Turkish War (1716‚Äì1718), in which Austria conquered the remaining areas of the former Hungarian Kingdom, ending with the Treaty of Passarowitz in 1718. Another war with Russia started in 1735. The Austrians joined in 1737; the war ended in 1739 with the Treaty of Belgrade (with Austria) and the Treaty of Ni≈° (with Russia). The fourth Russo-Turkish War started in 1768 and ended in 1774 with the Treaty of K√º√ß√ºk Kaynarca. Another war with Russia started in 1787 and a concurrent war with Austria followed in 1788; the Austrian war ended with the 1791 Treaty of Sistova, and the Russian war ended with the 1792 Treaty of Jassy. An invasion of Egypt and Syria by Napoleon I of France took place in 1798‚Äì99, but ended due to British intervention. Napoleon's capture of Malta on his way to Egypt resulted in the unusual alliance of Russia and the Ottomans resulting in a joint naval expedition to the Ionian Islands. Their successful capture of these islands led to the setting up of the Septinsular Republic. = 19th century = Greek War of Independence The First Serbian Uprising took place in 1804, followed by the Second Serbian Uprising in 1815; Serbia was fully liberated by 1867. Officially recognized independence followed in 1878. The sixth Russo-Turkish War began in 1806 and ended in May 1812, just 13 days before Napoleon's invasion of Russia. Moldavian‚ÄìWallachian (Romanian) Uprising (starting simultaneously with the Greek Revolution). The Greek War of Independence, taking place from 1821 to 1832, in which the Great Powers intervened from 1827, including Russia (seventh Russo-Turkish war, 1828‚Äì1829), achieved independence for Greece; the Treaty of Adrianople ended the war.

The ninth and final Russo-Turkish War started in 1877, the same year the Ottomans withdrew from the Constantinople Conference. Romania then declared its independence and waged war on Turkey, joined by Serbians and Bulgarians and finally the Russians (see also History of Russia (1855‚Äì92)). Austria occupied Bosnia in 1878. The Russians and the Ottomans signed the Treaty of San Stefano in early 1878. After deliberations at the Congress of Berlin, which was attended by all the Great Powers of the time, the Treaty of Berlin (1878) recognized several territorial changes. Eastern Rumelia was granted some autonomy in 1878, rebelled and joined Bulgaria in 1885. Thessaly ceded to Greece in 1881, but after Greece attacked the Ottoman Empire to help the Second Cretan Uprising in 1897, Greece was defeated in Thessaly.  Dissolution (1908‚Äì22)  Public demonstration in the Sultanahmet district of Constantinople, 1908 =Italo-Turkish War= In 1911, Italy invaded Ottoman Tripolitania (During the decolonisation of Africa, Tripolitania became Libya), which was controlled by the Ottoman Empire. The war ended with the annexation of the Tripolitania. =Ilinden‚ÄìPreobrazhenie Uprising= Bulgarian insurrection from 1903. See Ilinden‚ÄìPreobrazhenie Uprising. = 1912‚Äì13: Balkan Wars = Surrender of Ioannina by Esat Pasha to the Greek Crown Prince Constantine during the First Balkan War. Two Balkan Wars, in 1912 and 1913, entailed further action against the Ottoman Empire in Europe. The Balkan League first conquered Macedonia and most of Thrace from the Ottoman Empire, and then fell out over the division of the spoils. Albania declared its independence from the Ottoman Empire in 1912, after several rebellions and uprisings. This reduced Turkey's possessions in Europe (Rumelia) to their present borders in Eastern Thrace. =World War I= World War I (1914‚Äì1918) became the ultimate cause of the collapse of the Ottoman Empire, which formally ended in 1922. However, during wartime operations the Empire prevented the British Royal Navy from reaching Constantinople, stopping an Entente invasion in the Battle of Gallipoli (1915‚Äì1916). Nevertheless, under the provisions of the Treaty of Lausanne (1923) the Empire ultimately fell. See also References Further reading * Anderson M.S.

The 3D acquired distribution arises from the convolution of the real light sources with the PSF. A point source as imaged by a system with negative (top), zero (center), and positive (bottom) spherical aberration. Images to the left are defocused toward the inside, images on the right toward the outside. The point spread function (PSF) describes the response of an imaging system to a point source or point object. A more general term for the PSF is a system's impulse response, the PSF being the impulse response of a focused optical system. The PSF in many contexts can be thought of as the extended blob in an image that represents a single point object. In functional terms, it is the spatial domain version of the optical transfer function of the imaging system. It is a useful concept in Fourier optics, astronomical imaging, medical imaging, electron microscopy and other imaging techniques such as 3D microscopy (like in confocal laser scanning microscopy) and fluorescence microscopy. The degree of spreading (blurring) of the point object is a measure for the quality of an imaging system. In non-coherent imaging systems, such as fluorescent microscopes, telescopes or optical microscopes, the image formation process is linear in the image intensity and described by linear system theory. This means that when two objects A and B are imaged simultaneously, the resulting image is equal to the sum of the independently imaged objects. In other words: the imaging of A is unaffected by the imaging of B and vice versa, owing to the non-interacting property of photons. In space-invariant system, i.e. the PSF is the same everywhere in the imaging space, the image of a complex object is then the convolution of the true object and the PSF. Introduction By virtue of the linearity property of optical non-coherent imaging systems, i.e., : Image(Object1 \\\\+ Object2) = Image(Object1) + Image(Object2) the image of an object in a microscope or telescope can be computed by expressing the object-plane field as a weighted sum over 2D impulse functions, and then expressing the image plane field as the weighted sum over the images of these impulse functions. This is known as the superposition principle, valid for linear systems. The images of the individual object-plane impulse functions are called point spread functions, reflecting the fact that a mathematical point of light in the object plane is spread out to form a finite area in the image plane (in some branches of mathematics and physics, these might be referred to as Green's functions or impulse response functions). Application of PSF: Deconvolution of the mathematically modeled PSF and the low-resolution image enhances the resolution. When the object is divided into discrete point objects of varying intensity, the image is computed as a sum of the PSF of each point. As the PSF is typically determined entirely by the imaging system (that is, microscope or telescope), the entire image can be described by knowing the optical properties of the system. This imaging process is usually formulated by a convolution equation. In microscope image processing and astronomy, knowing the PSF of the measuring device is very important for restoring the (original) object with deconvolution. For the case of laser beams, the PSF can be mathematically modeled using the concepts of Gaussian beams. For instance, deconvolution of the mathematically modeled PSF and the image, improves visibility of features and removes imaging noise. Theory The point spread function may be independent of position in the object plane, in which case it is called shift invariant. In addition, if there is no distortion in the system, the image plane coordinates are linearly related to the object plane coordinates via the magnification M as: :(x_i, y_i) = (M x_o, M y_o). If the imaging system produces an inverted image, we may simply regard the image plane coordinate axes as being reversed from the object plane axes. With these two assumptions, i.e., that the PSF is shift-invariant and that there is no distortion, calculating the image plane convolution integral is a straightforward process. Mathematically, we may represent the object plane field as: : O(x_o,y_o) = \\\\int\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\int O(u,v) ~ \\\\delta(x_o-u,y_o-v) ~ du\\\\, dv i.e., as a sum over weighted impulse functions, although this is also really just stating the shifting property of 2D delta functions (discussed further below). Rewriting the object transmittance function in the form above allows us to calculate the image plane field as the superposition of the images of each of the individual impulse functions, i.e., as a superposition over weighted point spread functions in the image plane using the same weighting function as in the object plane, i.e., O(x_o,y_o). Mathematically, the image is expressed as: :I(x_o,y_o) = \\\\int\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\int O(u,v) ~ \\\\mathrm{PSF}(x_i/M-u , y_i/M-v) \\\\, du\\\\, dv in which \\\\mbox{PSF}(x_i/M-u,y_i/M-v) is the image of the impulse function Œ¥(xo ‚àí u, yo ‚àí v). The 2D impulse function may be regarded as the limit (as side dimension w tends to zero) of the \\"square post\\" function, shown in the figure below. 220px We imagine the object plane as being decomposed into square areas such as this, with each having its own associated square post function. If the height, h, of the post is maintained at 1/w2, then as the side dimension w tends to zero, the height, h, tends to infinity in such a way that the volume (integral) remains constant at 1. This gives the 2D impulse the sifting property (which is implied in the equation above), which says that when the 2D impulse function, Œ¥(x ‚àí u,y ‚àí v), is integrated against any other continuous function, , it \\"sifts out\\" the value of f at the location of the impulse, i.e., at the point . The concept of a perfect point source object is central to the idea of PSF. However, there is no such thing in nature as a perfect mathematical point source radiator; the concept is completely non-physical and is rather a mathematical construct used to model and understand optical imaging systems. The utility of the point source concept comes from the fact that a point source in the 2D object plane can only radiate a perfect uniform-amplitude, spherical wave ‚Äî a wave having perfectly spherical, outward travelling phase fronts with uniform intensity everywhere on the spheres (see Huygens‚ÄìFresnel principle). Such a source of uniform spherical waves is shown in the figure below. We also note that a perfect point source radiator will not only radiate a uniform spectrum of propagating plane waves, but a uniform spectrum of exponentially decaying (evanescent) waves as well, and it is these which are responsible for resolution finer than one wavelength (see Fourier optics). This follows from the following Fourier transform expression for a 2D impulse function, :\\\\delta (x,y) \\\\propto \\\\int\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\int e^{j(k_x x + k_y y)} \\\\, d k_x\\\\, d k_y 400px The quadratic lens intercepts a portion of this spherical wave, and refocuses it onto a blurred point in the image plane. For a single lens, an on-axis point source in the object plane produces an Airy disc PSF in the image plane. It can be shown (see Fourier optics, Huygens‚ÄìFresnel principle, Fraunhofer diffraction) that the field radiated by a planar object (or, by reciprocity, the field converging onto a planar image) is related to its corresponding source (or image) plane distribution via a Fourier transform (FT) relation. In addition, a uniform function over a circular area (in one FT domain) corresponds to the Airy function, in the other FT domain, where is the first- order Bessel function of the first kind. That is, a uniformly-illuminated circular aperture that passes a converging uniform spherical wave yields an Airy function image at the focal plane. A graph of a sample 2D Airy function is shown in the adjoining figure. 300px Therefore, the converging (partial) spherical wave shown in the figure above produces an Airy disc in the image plane. The argument of the Airy function is important, because this determines the scaling of the Airy disc (in other words, how big the disc is in the image plane). If Œòmax is the maximum angle that the converging waves make with the lens axis, r is radial distance in the image plane, and wavenumber k = 2œÄ/Œª where Œª = wavelength, then the argument of the Airy function is: . If Œòmax is small (only a small portion of the converging spherical wave is available to form the image), then radial distance, r, has to be very large before the total argument of the Airy function moves away from the central spot. In other words, if Œòmax is small, the Airy disc is large (which is just another statement of Heisenberg's uncertainty principle for Fourier Transform pairs, namely that small extent in one domain corresponds to wide extent in the other domain, and the two are related via the space-bandwidth product). By virtue of this, high magnification systems, which typically have small values of Œòmax (by the Abbe sine condition), can have more blur in the image, owing to the broader PSF. The size of the PSF is proportional to the magnification, so that the blur is no worse in a relative sense, but it is definitely worse in an absolute sense. The figure above illustrates the truncation of the incident spherical wave by the lens. In order to measure the point spread function ‚Äî or impulse response function ‚Äî of the lens, a perfect point source that radiates a perfect spherical wave in all directions of space is not needed. This is because the lens has only a finite (angular) bandwidth, or finite intercept angle. Therefore, any angular bandwidth contained in the source, which extends past the edge angle of the lens (i.e., lies outside the bandwidth of the system), is essentially wasted source bandwidth because the lens can't intercept it in order to process it. As a result, a perfect point source is not required in order to measure a perfect point spread function. All we need is a light source which has at least as much angular bandwidth as the lens being tested (and of course, is uniform over that angular sector). In other words, we only require a point source which is produced by a convergent (uniform) spherical wave whose half angle is greater than the edge angle of the lens. Due to intrinsic limited resolution of the imaging systems, measured PSFs are not free of uncertainty. In imaging, it is desired to suppress the side-lobes of the imaging beam by apodization techniques. In the case of transmission imaging systems with Gaussian beam distribution, the PSF is modeled by the following equation: PSF(f,z)=I_r(0,z,f)\\\\exp(-z\\\\alpha(f))-\\\\dfrac{2\\\\rho^2}{0.36{\\\\frac{cka}{\\\\text{NA}f}}\\\\sqrt{{1+\\\\left ( \\\\frac{2\\\\ln 2}{c\\\\pi}\\\\left ( \\\\frac{\\\\text{NA}}{0.56k} \\\\right )^2 fz\\\\right )}^2}}, where k-factor depends on the truncation ratio and level of the irradiance, NA is numerical aperture, c is the speed of light, f is the photon frequency of the imaging beam, Ir is the intensity of reference beam, a is adjustment factor and is the radial position from the center of the beam on the corresponding z-plane. History and methods The diffraction theory of point spread functions was first studied by Airy in the nineteenth century. He developed an expression for the point spread function amplitude and intensity of a perfect instrument, free of aberrations (the so-called Airy disc). The theory of aberrated point spread functions close to the optimum focal plane was studied by Zernike and Nijboer in the 1930‚Äì40s. A central role in their analysis is played by Zernike's circle polynomials that allow an efficient representation of the aberrations of any optical system with rotational symmetry. Recent analytic results have made it possible to extend Nijboer and Zernike's approach for point spread function evaluation to a large volume around the optimum focal point. This extended Nijboer-Zernike (ENZ) theory allows studying the imperfect imaging of three-dimensional objects in confocal microscopy or astronomy under non-ideal imaging conditions. The ENZ-theory has also been applied to the characterization of optical instruments with respect to their aberration by measuring the through-focus intensity distribution and solving an appropriate inverse problem.  Applications  = Microscopy = An example of an experimentally derived point spread function from a confocal microscope using a 63x 1.4NA oil objective. It was generated using Huygens Professional deconvolution software. Shown are views in xz, xy, yz and a 3D representation. In microscopy, experimental determination of PSF requires sub- resolution (point-like) radiating sources. Quantum dots and fluorescent beads are usually considered for this purpose.Light transmitted through minute holes in a thin layer of silver vacuum or chemically deposited on a slide or cover- slip have also been used, as they are bright and do not photo-bleach. Theoretical models as described above, on the other hand, allow the detailed calculation of the PSF for various imaging conditions. The most compact diffraction limited shape of the PSF is usually preferred. However, by using appropriate optical elements (e.g., a spatial light modulator) the shape of the PSF can be engineered towards different applications. = Astronomy = The point spread function of Hubble Space Telescope's WFPC camera before corrections were applied to its optical system. In observational astronomy, the experimental determination of a PSF is often very straightforward due to the ample supply of point sources (stars or quasars). The form and source of the PSF may vary widely depending on the instrument and the context in which it is used. For radio telescopes and diffraction-limited space telescopes, the dominant terms in the PSF may be inferred from the configuration of the aperture in the Fourier domain. In practice, there may be multiple terms contributed by the various components in a complex optical system. A complete description of the PSF will also include diffusion of light (or photo- electrons) in the detector, as well as tracking errors in the spacecraft or telescope. For ground-based optical telescopes, atmospheric turbulence (known as astronomical seeing) dominates the contribution to the PSF. In high- resolution ground-based imaging, the PSF is often found to vary with position in the image (an effect called anisoplanatism). In ground-based adaptive optics systems, the PSF is a combination of the aperture of the system with residual uncorrected atmospheric terms. = Lithography = Overlapped PSF peaks. When the peaks are as close as ~ 1 wavelength/NA, they are effectively merged. The FWHM is ~ 0.6 wavelength/NA at this point. The PSF is also a fundamental limit to the conventional focused imaging of a hole,The Natural Resolution with the minimum printed size being in the range of 0.6-0.7 wavelength/NA, with NA being the numerical aperture of the imaging system.Principles and Practice of Light MicroscopyCorner Rounding and Line-end Shortening For example, in the case of an EUV system with wavelength of 13.5 nm and NA=0.33, the minimum individual hole size that can be imaged is in the range of 25-29 nm. A phase-shift mask has 180-degree phase edges which allow finer resolution. = Ophthalmology = Point spread functions have recently become a useful diagnostic tool in clinical ophthalmology. Patients are measured with a Shack-Hartmann wavefront sensor, and special software calculates the PSF for that patient's eye. This method allows a physician to simulate potential treatments on a patient, and estimate how those treatments would alter the patient's PSF. Additionally, once measured the PSF can be minimized using an adaptive optics system. This, in conjunction with a CCD camera and an adaptive optics system, can be used to visualize anatomical structures not otherwise visible in vivo, such as cone photoreceptors.

With a speed of , she captured the Blue Riband from Cunard Line's and . Germany came to dominate the Atlantic, and by 1906 they had five four-funnel superliners in service, four of them owned by North German Lloyd and part of the so-called \\"\\". At around the same time the American financier J. P. Morgan's International Mercantile Marine Co. was attempting to monopolise the shipping trade, and had already acquired Britain's other major transatlantic line, the White Star Line.Maxtone-Graham 1972, p. 11. In the face of these threats the Cunard Line was determined to regain the prestige of dominance in ocean travel not only for the company, but also for the United Kingdom.Floating Palaces. (1996) A&E.; TV Documentary. Narrated by Fritz Weaver. By 1902, Cunard Line and the British government reached an agreement to build two superliners, Lusitania and Mauretania, with a guaranteed service speed of no less than . The British government was to loan ¬£2,600,000 (¬£ in 2015) for the construction of the ships, at an interest rate of 2.75%, to be paid back over twenty years, with a stipulation that the ships could be converted to armed merchant cruisers if needed.Layton, J. Kent. (2007) Lusitania: An Illustrated Biography, Lulu Press, pp. 3, 39. Further funding was acquired when the Admiralty arranged for Cunard to be paid an additional sum per year to their mail subsidy.Vale, Vivian, The American Peril: Challenge to Britain on the North Atlantic, 1901‚Äì04, pp. 143‚Äì183. Design and construction Mauretania after being launched, 20 September 1906 Workmen standing below Mauretanias original three-bladed propellers in dry dock left Mauretania and Lusitania were both designed by Cunard naval architect Leonard Peskett, with Swan Hunter and John Brown working from plans for an ocean greyhound with a stipulated service speed of twenty-four knots in moderate weather, as per the terms of her mail subsidy contract. Peskett's original configuration for the ships in 1902 was a three-funnel design, when reciprocating engines were destined to be the powerplant. A giant model of the ships appeared in Shipbuilder's magazine in this configuration. Cunard decided to change power plants to Parson's new turbine technology, and the ship's design was again modified when Peskett added a fourth funnel to the ship's profile. Construction of the vessel finally began with the laying of the keel in August 1904. In 1906, Mauretania was launched by the Duchess of Roxburghe.Maxtone-Graham 1972, p. 25. At the time of her launch, she was the largest moving structure ever built, and slightly larger in gross tonnage than Lusitania. The main visual differences between Mauretania and Lusitania were that Mauretania was five feet longer and had different vents.Layton 2007, p. 44. Mauretania also had two extra stages of turbine blades in her forward turbines, making her slightly faster than Lusitania. Mauretania and Lusitania were the only ships with direct-drive steam turbines to hold the Blue Riband; in later ships, reduction-geared turbines were mainly used.Williams, Trevor. (1982) A short history of twentieth-century technology. Oxford University Press, p. 174. Mauretanias usage of the steam turbine was the largest application yet of the then-new technology, developed by Charles Algernon Parsons.Maxtone-Graham 1972, p. 15. During speed trials, these engines caused significant vibration at high speeds; in response, Mauretania received strengthening members aft and redesigned propellers before entering service, which reduced vibration.Maxtone-Graham 1972, pp. 38‚Äì39. Mauretania was designed to suit Edwardian tastes. The ship's interior was designed by Harold Peto, architect, and her public rooms were fitted out by two notable London design houses ‚Äì Ch. Mellier & Sons and Turner and Lord,Maxtone-Graham 1972, p. 31. with twenty-eight different types of wood, along with marble, tapestries, and other furnishings such as the stunning octagon table in the smoking room.Maxtone-Graham 1972, pp. 33‚Äì36. Wood panelling for her first class public rooms was supposedly carved by three hundred craftsmen from Palestine but this seems unlikely, unnecessary and was probably executed by the yard or subcontracted, as were the majority of the second and third class areas.Maxtone-Graham 1972, p. 33. The multi-level first-class dining saloon of straw oak was decorated in Francis I style and topped by a large dome skylight. A series of elevators, then a rare new feature for liners, with grilles composed of the relatively new lightweight aluminum, were installed next to Mauretanias walnut grand staircase. A new feature was the Verandah Caf√© on the boat deck, where passengers were served beverages in a weather- protected environment, although this was enclosed within a year as it proved unrealistic. Comparison with the Olympic class 237x237px The White Star Line's vessels were almost longer and slightly wider than Lusitania and Mauretania. This made the White Star vessels about 15,000 gross register tons larger than the Cunard vessels. Both Lusitania and Mauretania were launched and had been in service for several years before , Titanic and were ready for the North Atlantic run. Although significantly faster than the Olympic class would be, the speed and port turnaround times of Cunard's vessels was not sufficient to allow the line to run a weekly two-ship transatlantic service from each side of the Atlantic. A third ship was needed for a weekly service, and in response to White Star's announced plan to build the three Olympic- class ships, Cunard ordered a third ship: . Like Olympic, Cunard's Aquitania had a lower service speed, but was a larger and more luxurious vessel. With their increased size the Olympic-class liners could offer many more amenities than Lusitania and Mauretania. Both Olympic and Titanic offered swimming pools, turkish baths, a gymnasium, a squash court, large reception rooms, √Ä la Carte restaurants separate from the dining saloons, and many more staterooms with private bathroom facilities than their two Cunard rivals. Heavy vibrations as a by-product of the four steam turbines on Lusitania and Mauretania plagued both ships throughout their careers. When Lusitania sailed at top speed the vibrations were so severe that Second and Third Class sections of the ship could become uninhabitable.Archibald, Rick & Ballard, Robert.The Lost Ships of Robert Ballard, Thunder Bay Press: 2005; p. 46. In contrast, the Olympic-class liners utilized two traditional reciprocating engines and only one turbine for the central propeller, which greatly reduced vibration. Because of their greater tonnage and wider beam, the Olympic-class liners were also more stable at sea and less prone to rolling. Lusitania and Mauretania both featured straight prows in contrast to the angled prows of the Olympic liners. Designed so that the ships could plunge through a wave rather than crest it, the unforeseen consequence was that the Cunard liners would pitch forward alarmingly, even in calm weather, allowing huge waves to splash the bow and forward part of the superstructure.Archibald, Rick & Ballard, Robert.\\"The Lost Ships of Robert Ballard,\\" Thunder Bay Press: 2005; pp. 51-52. The vessels of the Olympic class also differed from Lusitania and Mauretania in the way in which they were compartmented below the waterline. The White Star vessels were divided by transverse watertight bulkheads. While Lusitania also had transverse bulkheads, it also had longitudinal bulkheads running along the ship on each side, between the boiler and engine rooms and the coal bunkers on the outside of the vessel. The British commission that had investigated the sinking of Titanic in 1912 heard testimony on the flooding of coal bunkers lying outside longitudinal bulkheads. Being of considerable length, when flooded, these could increase the ship's list and \\"make the lowering of the boats on the other side impracticable\\" ‚Äî and this was precisely what later happened with Lusitania. Furthermore, the ship's stability was insufficient for the bulkhead arrangement used: flooding of only three coal bunkers on one side could result in negative metacentric height. On the other hand, Titanic was given ample stability and sank with only a few degrees list, the design being such that there was very little risk of unequal flooding and possible capsize. Lusitania did not carry enough lifeboats for all her passengers, officers and crew on board at the time of her maiden voyage (actually carrying four lifeboats fewer than Titanic would carry in 1912). This was a common practice for large passenger ships at the time, since the belief was that in busy shipping lanes help would always be nearby and the few boats available would be adequate to ferry all aboard to rescue ships before a sinking. After Titanic sank, Lusitania and Mauretania would be equipped with only six more clinker-built wooden boats under davits, making for a total of 22 boats rigged in davits. The rest of their lifeboat accommodations were supplemented with 26 collapsible lifeboats, 18 stored directly beneath the regular lifeboats and eight on the after deck. The collapsibles were built with hollow wooden bottoms and canvas sides, and needed assembly in the event they had to be used. This contrasted with Olympic and Britannic which received a full complement of lifeboats all rigged under davits. This difference would have been a major contributor to the high loss of life involved with Lusitanias sinking, since there was not sufficient time to assemble collapsible boats or life-rafts, had it not been that the ship's severe listing made it impossible for lifeboats on the port side of the vessel to be lowered, and the rapidity of the sinking did not allow the remaining lifeboats that could be directly lowered (as these were rigged under davits) to be filled and launched with passengers. When Britannic, working as a hospital ship during World War I, sank in 1916 after hitting a mine in the Kea channel the already davited boats were swiftly lowered saving nearly all on board, but the ship took nearly three times as long to sink as Lusitania and thus the crew had more time to evacuate passengers.  Early career (1906‚Äì1914)  Mauretania during a speed trial off St. Abbs, Scotland, 18 September 1907. Best speed obtained was 25.73 knots sea trials, passing Castle Wemyss and the Station Clock Tower on the Measured Mile, Skelmorlie, 1 October 1907 Mauretania departed Liverpool on her maiden voyage on 16 November 1907 under the command of Captain John Pritchard, and on the return voyage (30 November‚Äì5 December 1907) captured the record for the fastest eastbound crossing of the Atlantic, with an average speed of . On 23 December 1907, Mauretania was again at New York City and moored to Pier 54 in the North River when a squall with high winds struck, causing mooring posts on Pier 54 to give way. Mauretania went partially adrift, and her bow swung around and struck several barges which were bringing her coal and taking off ashes; the barges Roan and Tomhicken and the boats Eureka 32 and Eureka 36 were damaged and the barge Ellis P. Rogers was lost. In subsequent litigation, the Cunard Line was found liable for damages.Anonymous, The Federal Reporter, Volume 174, St. Paul, Minnesota: West Publishing Company, 1910, pp. 166‚Äì175.Department of Commerce and Labor Bureau of Navigation Fortieth Annual List of Merchant Vessels of the United States for the Year Ending June 30, 1908, Washington, D.C.: Government Printing Office, 1908, p. 383. In September 1909, Mauretania captured the Blue Riband for the fastest westbound crossing ‚Äî a record that was to stand for more than two decades. In December 1911, as in New York City in December 1910, Mauretania broke loose from her moorings while in the River Mersey and sustained damage that caused the cancellation of her special speedy Christmas voyage to New York. In a quick change of events Cunard rescheduled Mauretanias voyage for Lusitania, which had just returned from New York, under the command of Captain James Charles. Lusitania completed Christmas crossings for Mauretania,Layton 2007, p. 120. carrying travelers back to New York. Mauretania was on a westbound voyage from Liverpool to New York, beginning 10 April 1912, and was docked at Queenstown, Ireland, at the time of the disaster. Mauretania was transporting Titanics cargo manifest carried by registered mail. Traveling on Mauretania at the time was the chairman of the Cunard line, Mr A.A. Booth, who organised a vigil for the Titanic victims. In the spring of 1913 westbound transatlantic passage aboard Mauretania cost roughly $17 for third class passengers, as shown in the original ticket at right. 3rd class ticket on Mauretania, 1913 In July 1913 King George and Queen Mary were given a special tour of Mauretania, then Britain's fastest merchant vessel, adding further distinction to the ship's reputation. On 26 January 1914, while Mauretania was in the middle of annual refit in Liverpool, four men were killed and six injured when a gas cylinder exploded while they were working on one of her steam turbines. Damage to the ship was minimal; she was repaired in the new Gladstone drydock and returned to service two months later. World War I (1914‚Äì1919) Shortly after Great Britain declared war on Germany on 4 August 1914, Mauretania made a dash for safety in Halifax, arriving on 6 August. Shortly after, she and were requested by the British government to become armed merchant cruisers,Layton 2007, pp. 170‚Äì171. but their huge size and massive fuel consumption made them unsuitable for the duty, and they resumed their civilian service on 11 August. Later, due to lack of passengers crossing the Atlantic, Mauretania was laid up in Liverpool until May 1915 at the time that Lusitania was sunk by a German U-Boat. HMT Mauretania with her second geometric dazzle camouflage scheme designed by Norman Wilkinson Mauretania was about to fill the void left by Lusitania, but she was ordered by the British government to serve as a troop ship to carry British soldiers during the Gallipoli Campaign. She avoided becoming prey for German U-boats because of her high speed and the seamanship of her crew. As a troopship, she was painted in dark greys with black funnels, as were her contemporaries. HMHS Mauretania; a simulated image made from a retouched November trials postcard ‚Äì the number of lifeboats confirms this When combined forces from the British empire and France began to suffer heavy casualties, Mauretania was ordered to serve as a hospital ship, along with her fellow Cunarder Aquitania and White Star's , to treat the wounded until 25 January 1916. In medical service the vessel was painted white with buff funnels and large medical cross emblems surrounding the vessel and possibly illuminated signs starboard and port. Seven months later, Mauretania once again became a troop ship late in 1916 when requisitioned by the Canadian government to carry Canadian troops from Halifax to Liverpool. Her war duty was not yet over when the United States declared war on Germany in 1917, and she carried thousands of American troops. The ship was known by the Admiralty as HMS TuberoseOcean liners of the past: the Cunard express liners Lusitania and Mauretania. Published by Patrick Stephens, 1970 (p. 207). until the end of the war, but the vessel's name was never changed by Cunard. Starting in March 1918, Mauretania received two forms of dazzle camouflage, a type of abstract colour scheming designed by Norman Wilkinson in 1917 in an effort to confuse enemy ships. The first camouflage scheme, applied early in March 1918, was curvilinear in nature and largely broad areas of olive with blacks, greys and blues. The second scheme was the more geometric design commonly referred to as \\"dazzle\\"; this design, applied by July 1918, was mostly several dark blues and greys with some black. After her war service, she was repainted in a drab grey scheme and finally full Cunard livery by the middle of 1919. Post-war career (1919‚Äì1934) Verandah Caf√© on the boat deck Mauretania returned to civilian service on 21 September 1919. Her busy sailing schedule prevented her from having an extensive overhaul scheduled in 1920. However, in 1921 Cunard Line removed her from service when fire broke out on E deck and decided to give her a much needed overhaul. She returned to the Tyne shipyard where she was built, where her boilers were converted to oil firing,Maxtone-Graham 1972, pp. 342‚Äì345. and returned to service in March 1922. Cunard noticed that Mauretania struggled to maintain her regular Atlantic service speed. Although the ship's service speed had improved and it now burned only of oil per 24 hours, compared to of coal previously, it was not operating at her pre-war service speeds. On one crossing in 1922 the ship managed an average speed of only . It was during these years her promenade was enclosed. Cunard decided that the ship's once revolutionary turbines were in desperate need of an overhaul. In 1923, a major refitting was begun in Southampton. Mauretanias turbines were dismantled. Halfway through the overhaul, the shipyard workers went on strike and the work was halted, so Cunard had the ship towed to Cherbourg, France, where the work was completed at another shipyard. In May 1924, the ship returned to Atlantic service. Mauretanias Second Class Smoking Room alt= In 1928 Mauretania was refurbished with a new interior design and in the next year her speed record was broken by a German liner, ,Maxtone-Graham 1972, p. 255. with a speed of . On 27 August, Cunard permitted the former ocean greyhound to have one final attempt to recapture the record from the newer German liner. She was taken out of service and her engines were adjusted to produce more power to give a higher service speed; however, this was still not enough. Bremen simply represented a new generation of ocean liners that were far more powerful and technologically advanced than the aging Cunard liner. Even though Mauretania did not beat her German rival, the ship lost by just a fraction after decades of design improvement and beat all her own previous speed records both east and westbound. In 1929 Mauretania collided with a train ferry near Robbins Reef Light. No one was killed or injured and her damage was quickly repaired. In 1930, with a combination of the Great Depression and newer competitors on the Atlantic run, Mauretania became a dedicated cruise shipMaxtone-Graham 1972, p. 340. running six day cruises from New York to Pier 21 in Halifax, Nova Scotia. On 19 November 1930, Mauretania rescued 28 people and the ship's cat of the Swedish cargo ship which foundered in the Atlantic Ocean south east of Cape Race, Newfoundland. In June 1933, she was painted white for cruise service. When Cunard Line merged with White Star Line in 1934, Mauretania, along with , , and other aging ocean liners, were deemed surplus to requirements and withdrawn from service. Retirement and scrapping The two former rivals, Olympic (left) and Mauretania (right) moored along the \\"new\\" Western Docks in Southampton in 1935, before Mauretania‚Ä≤s final voyage to the breaker's yard in Rosyth, Scotland Cunard White Star withdrew Mauretania from service following a final eastward crossing from New York to Southampton in September 1934. The voyage was made at an average speed of , equalling the original contractual stipulation for her mail subsidy. She was then laid up at Southampton, her twenty-eight years of service at a close. In May 1935 her furnishings and fittings were put up for auction by Hampton and Sons and on 1 July that year she departed Southampton for the last time to Metal Industries shipbreakers at Rosyth. One of her former captains, the retired commodore Sir Arthur Rostron, captain of during the rescue, came to see her on her final departure from Southampton. Rostron refused to go aboard Mauretania before her final journey, stating that he preferred to remember the ship as she was when he commanded her. 324x324px En route to Rosyth, Mauretania stopped at her birthplace on the Tyne for half an hour, where she drew crowds of sightseers. Rockets were fired from her bridge, messages relayed, and she was boarded by the Lord Mayor of Newcastle. The mayor bade her farewell from the people of Newcastle, and her last captain, A. T. Brown, then resumed his course for Rosyth. Approximately 30 miles north of Newcastle is the small seaport of Amble, Northumberland. The local town council sent a telegram to the ship stating, \\"Still the finest ship on the seas.\\" To which Mauretania replied with, \\"to the last and kindliest port in England, greetings and thanks.\\" Amble, to this day, is still known as 'Amble, the Friendliest Port', and this is still seen on signs when entering the town. With masts cut down to fit, the ship passed under the Forth Bridge and was delivered to the breakers. Mauretania arrived at Rosyth in Scotland at about 6 am on 4 July 1935 during a half-gale, passing under Forth Bridge. By 6:30 am she passed the entrance to the Metal Industries yards under the command of Pilot Captain Whince. A lone kilted piper was present at the quayside, playing a funeral lament for the popular vessel. It was reported to author and historian John Maxtone-Graham that upon the final shut-down of her great engines, she gave a dark \\"final shudder...\\". Mauretania had her last public inspection on 8 July, a Sunday with 20,000 in attendance, with the monies raised going to local charities. Scrapping began shortly after and with great rapidity. Unusually, she was cut up afloat in drydock, with a complex system of wooden battens and pencil marks to monitor her balance. In a month her funnels were gone. By 1936 she was little more than a hulk, and she was beached at the tidal basin at Metal Industries and her remaining structure was scrapped by 1937. To prevent a rival company using the name and to keep it available for a future Cunard White Star liner, arrangements were made for the Red Funnel Paddle Steamer Queen to be renamed Mauretania in the interim before the launch of the new RMS Mauretania in 1938.Adams, R. B. [1986] Red Funnel and Before. Kingfisher Publications. The demise of the beloved Mauretania was protested by many of her loyal passengers, including President Franklin D. Roosevelt, who wrote a private letter against the scrapping.

The bar was panelled with great quantities of richly carved and gilt old growth African mahogany, which came from her first class lounge. The neon sign made for the 1937 opening on the south wall still advertises Mauretania and her bow lettering was used above the entrance. Additionally, nearly the complete first class reading-writing room, with the original chandeliers and ornate gilt grilled bookcases, has been serving as the boardroom at Pinewood Studios, west of London. The colour is no longer shimmering silver sycamore ‚Äì it has been altered over the years to an amber. According to a Channel 4 programme about coast properties the whole of the Second Class drawing room from the ship form the interior of a white and blue house overlooking Poole Harbour. The drawing room is overlooked by a balustraded circular veranda which is also original. Other panels and fittings were used to decorate the foyer and auditorium areas of the now defunct Windsor Cinema in Carluke. Some of the timber panelling was also used in the extension (completed in 1937) of St John the Baptist's Catholic Church in Padiham, Lancashire. An original model of Mauretania is displayed at the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, D.C. after a long stay on the retired Queen Mary in Long Beach, California. A gift from Franklin Delano Roosevelt, it was repainted white and green sometime in the 1930s. The ship's bell is currently located in the reception of the Lloyds Registry of Shipping, Fenchurch Street, London. Annually for Remembrance Day, Lloyds Register observe two minutes of silence and lay a wreath at its base in honour of servicemen and women.

Originally a model of Lusitania, it was converted to represent Mauretania after Lusitania was torpedoed.Paul Moloney, \\"Toronto's Lusitania model bound for Halifax\\", Toronto Star, 30 January 2010. Another large builder's model is situated aboard the ocean liner Queen Elizabeth 2, currently located in Dubai. This model was also originally Lusitania, and, like the Maritime Museum of the Atlantic's model, it was converted into Mauretania after Lusitania was lost.\\"The Mauretania model on board QE2\\" The QE2 Story When inspecting the model, one can tell it was Lusitania by examining the different boom crutches and bridge front, which is on the boat deck level. A model of the vessel which was originally commissioned by Cunard is now held in the collection of the National Maritime Museum in Greenwich. In 2010, a complete African mahogany pilaster from the first class lounge, fluted with an intricate gilt acanthus motif and intact rams head capital, was discovered and restored to its former glory. Since 2012, it has been on permanent display in the Discovery Museum's Segedunum Annex at Wallsend, just a few hundred yards from where it was carved and installed in the Swan Hunter fitting out basin, over a century earlier. Many examples of the liner's fixtures and fittings exist in private collections as well, including large sections of moulding, panelling, ceilings, samples of her turbine blades and much more. Mauretania is remembered in a song, \\"The fireman's lament\\" or \\"Firing the Mauretania\\", collected by Redd Sullivan.Hugill, Stan in Spin, The Folksong Magazine, Volume 1, # 9, 1962. The song starts \\"In 19 hundred and 24, I ... got a job on the Mauretania\\"; but then goes on to say \\"shovelling coal from morn till night\\" (not possible in 1924 as she was oil-fired by then). The number of \\"fires\\" is said to be 64. Hughie Jones also recorded the song but the last verse of Hughie's version calls upon \\"all you trimmers\\" whereas Redd Sullivan's version calls upon \\"stokers\\". The Clive Cussler Isaac Bell novel The Thief is set aboard Mauretania. A terrible fire engulfs the forward storage area but it is brought under control. Mauretania is also mentioned in Rudyard Kipling's poem \\"The Secret of the Machines\\": > The boat-express is waiting your command! > You will find the Mauretania at the quay, > Till her captain turns the lever 'neath his hand, > And the monstrous nine-decked city goes to sea. The Mauretania appears in The Country Mouse and the City Mouse Adventures episode \\"Posh Mice\\" in which the title characters travel among the mice and rat passengers on the ship's maiden voyage and thwart a steward's attempts to steal two Italian immigrants' papers and life savings during the voyage. The historical novel Maiden Voyage by British writer Roger Harvey set in Newcastle in the 1900s gives an accurate account of the building of Mauretania and features characters involved with her turbine engines. The climax of two love stories and a thriller comes as the ship approaches New York on her maiden voyage.Maiden Voyage by Roger Harvey, New Generation (2017), See also * RMS Lusitania * RMS Aquitania * RMS Olympic Notes References Further reading   * External links * Tyne & Wear Archives Service Mauretania website * Mauretania Home at Atlantic Liners * Category:Ships of the Cunard Line Category:Blue Riband holders Category:World War I passenger ships of the United Kingdom Category:Passenger ships of the United Kingdom Category:Steamships Category:Four funnel liners Category:RMS Titanic Category:Troop ships of the United Kingdom Category:1906 ships Category:Hospital ships in World War I Category:Ships built by Swan Hunter Category:Ships built on the River Tyne Category:Maritime incidents in 1907 ","title":"RMS Mauretania (1906)"},{"id":"865357","text":"Two classes of destroyer of the United States Navy are known as the Farragut class: * is a class of 8 ships launched in 1934-1935 * is a class of 10 ships launched in 1958-1960 Category:Destroyers ","title":"Farragut-class destroyer"},{"id":"865366","text":"Camilo Mori Serrano (September 24, 1896 in Valpara√≠so, Chile ‚Äì December 7, 1973 in Santiago, Chile) was a painter and a founder of the Grupo Montparnasse. The son of an Italian immigrant, Camilo Mori entered the \\"Escuela de Bellas Artes\\" (School of Fine Arts) at the University of Chile in 1914 and studied under masters Juan Francisco Gonz√°lez, Rich√≥n Brunet and Alberto Valenzuela Llanos. In 1920, he was sent by the Chilean government to further his studies in Europe. Over the next three years, Mori spent time in Rome and Paris. He joined the gathering of artists in the Montparnasse Quarter in Paris, France. There, his encounter with Pablo Picasso and Juan Gris greatly influenced his ideas of painting. However it was the influence of the works of Paul C√©zanne that challenged Mori to move away from the Realism that marked his earlier work. He started experimenting with a variety of styles which later formed the basis of modern art. He exhibited in the Salon d'Automne of 1920 in Paris, where his \\"Circo de la Feria\\" received an honorable mention. He returned to Chile and became one of the founding members of the Grupo Montparnasse, a key influence in the diffusion of the new European painting trends in Chile. In 1928 Camilo Mori was named director of the National Museum of Fine Arts (Spanish: Museo Nacional de Bellas Artes or MNBA). During his tenure in this post, he was responsible for many initiatives aimed at promoting art in Chile. In 1928, as an initiative to mitigate the closure of the School of Fine Arts, Mori was once again sent by the Chilean government to Europe, this time to direct the studies of a group of young painters known as the \\"Generation of 1928\\" (Spanish: Generacion del 28), which culminated in 26 of the most outstanding young Chilean artists being sent to study in Paris for five years. Mori returned to Chile in 1933, where he accepted a position as professor of drawing and color at the Universidad de Chile, a post he retained for over 30 years. In 1937 he moved to the United States where he spent two years exploring some of the newest artistic trends of the time. He was placed in charge of supervising the decoration of, and created a mural for, the pavilion of Chile at the 1939 New York World's Fair. For his contribution to Chilean art, in 1950 he received the National Prize of Art. His work was complex and multifaceted and moved through Post- Impressionism, Expressionism, Cubism and Surrealism, with the common trend among them being a prominent treatment of color.

Biography He was born on 8 October 1835 to a landowning family in Wesselburen in the Holstein region. At the age of 16 attended the Polytechnic School in Hannover. Starting in 1855, his early working life was spent in railroad engineering for the Hanover and Oldenburg state railways, designing some famous bridges and making some of the earliest uses of steel trusses. Even during his early railway years, Mohr had developed an interest in the theories of mechanics and the strength of materials. In 1867, he became professor of mechanics at Stuttgart Polytechnic, and in 1873 at Dresden Polytechnic. Mohr had a direct and unpretentious lecturing style that was popular with his students. In addition to a lone textbook, Mohr published many research papers on the theory of structures and strength of materials. In 1874, Mohr formalised the idea of a statically indeterminate structure. Mohr was an enthusiast for graphical tools and developed the method, for visually representing stress in three dimensions, previously proposed by Carl Culmann. In 1882, he famously developed the graphical method for analysing stress known as Mohr's circle and used it to propose an early theory of strength based on shear stress. He also developed the Williot-Mohr diagram for truss displacements and the Maxwell-Mohr method for analysing statically indeterminate structures, it can also be used to determine the displacement of truss nodes and forces acting on each member. The Maxwell-Mohr method is also referred to as the virtual force method for redundant trusses. He retired in 1900, yet continued his scientific work in Dresden until his death on 2 October 1918.

He was imprisoned from 1978-1988, 1990-1998, 2003-2005, and briefly in 2011 on state security charges related to his activism. In 2003, The New York Times described him as \\"Vietnam's most renowned dissident\\". Early life Que was born in 13 April 1942 in Hanoi in northern Vietnam, then occupied by the Imperial Japanese Army. His family, including his mother and five siblings immigrated to Saigon after the Geneva Accords, fleeing communist rule in North Vietnam. He received an M.D. from Saigon University at age 22. In the 1960s and early 70s, he trained in Europe on a United Nations scholarship, specializing in radiotherapy. In 1974, he joined the teaching staff at Saigon University, and the following year became the director of Cho-Ray Hospital. He had the opportunity to leave the country but chose to stay to provide medical care to the poor. However, he was removed from his post one year later for criticizing the communist regime's discriminatory health care policy. He then formed the pro-democracy group National Front for Progress. He also became Amnesty International's first member in Vietnam and began publishing two underground newspapers, \\"The Uprising\\" (Vung Day) for youth and \\"The People‚Äôs Uprising\\" (Toan Dan Vung Day) for the general public, to question the government‚Äôs violations of basic human rights and to demand that the government reduce military spending and invest in the welfare of the people. In 1978, he was arrested for his continued critique of national health care policy, along with 47 associates, and imprisoned without trial; many were tortured and five died in captivity. When Dr. Que demanded improvement in the treatment of political prisoners, he was incarcerated in a five-by-six foot cell without sanitary facilities for two months. He was sentenced for 10 years imprisonment. 1990-1998 imprisonment Que formed a new pro-democracy group following his arrest called the High Tide of Humanism Movement (). On 14 June 1990, he was arrested again. On 29 November 1991, after a half-hour sham trial he was sentenced to twenty years of hard labor plus five years' house arrest for treason after sending documents to Amnesty International; according to the Vietnamese national press agency, \\"reactionary forces used them to denigrate Vietnam\\" and \\"attempting to overthrow the people's government\\". Que's family and human rights groups reported that he was assigned to hard labor despite declining health. Vietnam's foreign ministry denied the statement. In April 1991, U.S. Senator Bob Kerrey attempted repeatedly to meet with Que, but was refused; U.S. Senator Charles S. Robb, whose district included Que's brother, was blocked by the Vietnamese government from meeting with Que to bring him medicine in August 1993. Que's case was also taken up by the European Parliament, Amnesty International, and France. Que was released in a 1998 general amnesty that included fellow dissident Doan Viet Hoat. Both Que and Hoat were offered resettlement in the United States on the condition that they leave the country. Que refused, stating that he would rather stay in prison than be forced into exile. Later activism Que remained in Vietnam, and on 12 May 1999, posted a statement to the Internet advocating free elections for the National Assembly. On 17 March 2003, Que was arrested for again after he wrote a series of articles about Vietnamese media censorship, with the regime accusing him of \\"espionage\\". On 29 January 2004, the Ho Chi Minh People's Court found him guilty of \\"abusing democratic rights to jeopardise the interests of the state, and the legitimate rights and interests of social organisations and citizens\\" and sentenced to 30 months' imprisonment. On September 22, 2004 Que was secretly sent to a hard labor camp (gulag) in Thanh Hoa Province. However, he was granted an amnesty on 31 January 2005 for T·∫øt, the Vietnamese New Year, along with fellow dissidents Nguyen Van Ly, Nguyen Dinh Huy, and Huynh Van Ba. In mid-February 2011, Que posted an Internet appeal for mass demonstrations in Vietnam on the model of the Arab Spring uprisings, calling on citizens to make a \\"clean sweep of Communist dictatorship and build a new, free, democratic, humane and progressive Vietnam\\". He was then detained by the authorities for \\"directly violating the stability and strength of the people's government\\". Following a raid on his home, police reported that they had found thousands of anti-government documents in his home. A government media report stated that he had been caught \\"red-handed keeping and distributing documents\\" calling for revolution. Amnesty International named him a prisoner of conscience and called for his immediate release. On 6 March 2012, former U.S. Representative Joseph Cao organized a Vietnamese-American lobbying effort for Que, Nguyen Van Ly, Dieu Cay, and other Vietnamese political prisoners, calling on the administration of President Barack Obama and the U.S. Congress to take a stronger stand on their behalf. Awards In 1995, Que was given the Robert F. Kennedy Human Rights Award by the Robert F. Kennedy Center for Justice and Human Rights. The Center praised his work \\"promoting greater freedom of expression and human rights in Viet Nam\\". In 2004, he was a finalist for the US-based Civil Courage Prize, which \\"honors civil courage ‚Äî steadfast resistance to evil at great personal risk ‚Äî rather than military valor\\". He ultimately won a \\"Certificate of Distinction in Civil Courage\\" and a $1,000 cash prize.

This squeeze occurs when declarer has two or more losers remaining. By cashing winners, declarer forces the squeezed defender to discard cards so that he cannot defeat the contract. Eventually, the defender will be forced to unguard a potential winner, exposing it to capture or be put on lead and forced to lead a suit that will cost his side a trick. Examples South is in a 6 contract with 11 top tricks on the K lead. To perform a simple squeeze, South would have to lose a trick at some point to rectify the count. This will not work on this hand because the only menaces South has are in clubs and spades. Ducking a trick in clubs would allow East to guard the suit. South must rely on a strip squeeze to make the hand. The first club trick is won, and the hearts then the diamonds are cashed. South remains with Q 4 J and A3 4 in dummy. West must choose between baring the K or Q. If West keeps K x, South puts West on lead with a club to lead away from the spade. Otherwise, South plays a spade to the Ace to drop West's King. An experienced West will try to make things as difficult as possible for South so that the correct route to 12 tricks is not certain. Making the key discard before the final winner is cashed will introduce as much ambiguity as possible. Although in double-dummy it is impossible to go wrong, occasionally South will make the wrong decision in competition. Squeezes often require declarer to know the location of specific high cards or the number of cards a defender holds in a particular suit, in order to know what cards the squeezee will be forced to play. Examples 2a and 2b illustrates: Again South needs three of the remaining tricks in a notrump contract. In Example 2a the presence of the diamond loser means that when South cashes the A, West is not squeezed. He can safely discard his idle 7. However, when South next plays the 3, West is squeezed again. East wins the Q, but must lead to dummy's winners. In Example 2b East's 3 2 are replaced by the 3 2 and declarer must know East's club length in order to make the correct play. If South cashes the A and then leads the 3, East wins the Q and will take the rest of the tricks. In this case, the correct play is for South to lose the Q immediately, before taking the A, in order to rectify the count. Now East is forced to lead a club to South's ace, and West is squeezed as before. But with East's hand as shown in Example 2a, losing the Q first does not work. East can return a spade, and declarer will score only the A. Not only does the squeeze position disappear, but there is no entry to cash the A. See also *Bridge Squeezes Complete by Clyde E.

Deep Thought was initially developed at Carnegie Mellon University and later at IBM. It was second in the line of chess computers developed by Feng-hsiung Hsu, starting with ChipTest and culminating in Deep Blue. In addition to Hsu, the Deep Thought team included Thomas Anantharaman, Mike Browne, Murray Campbell and Andreas Nowatzyk. Deep Thought became the first computer to beat a grandmaster in a regular tournament game when it beat Bent Larsen in 1988, but was easily defeated in both games of a two-game match with Garry Kasparov in 1989 as well as in a correspondence match with Michael Valvo. It was named after Deep Thought, a fictional computer in Douglas Adams' series, The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy. The naming of chess computers has continued in this vein with Deep Blue, Deep Fritz, Deep Junior, etc. Deep Thought won the North American Computer Chess Championship in 1988 and the World Computer Chess Championship in the year 1989, and its rating, according to the USCF was 2551. In 1994, Deep Thought 2 won the North American Computer Chess Championship for the fifth time, with its rating estimated at around 2600. It was sponsored by IBM. Some engineers who designed Deep Thought also worked in the design of Deep Thought 2. Its algorithms were quite simple evaluation functions, but it could examine half a billion chess positions per move in tournament games, which is sufficient to reach depth of 10 or 11 moves ahead in complex positions. Despite that, using the technique of singular extensions it could also follow lines of forced moves that reach even further, which is how it once found a checkmate in 18 moves.

It contains more than 200 species of annuals and perennials. Species in this genus can be found worldwide, except the Antarctic, in diverse habitats. The name Cardamine is derived from the Greek kardamon, cardamom, an unrelated plant in the ginger family, used as a pungent spice in cooking. Description The leaves can have different forms, from minute to medium in size. They can be simple, pinnate or bipinnate. They are basal and cauline (growing on the upper part of the stem), with narrow tips. They are rosulate (forming a rosette). The blade margins can be entire, serrate or dentate. The stem internodes lack firmness. The nearly radially symmetrical flowers grow in a racemose many-flowered inflorescence or in corymbs. The white, pink or purple flowers are minute to medium-sized. The petals are longer than the sepals. The fertile flowers are hermaphroditic. Taxonomy The genus Cardamine was first formally named in 1753 by Carl Linnaeus in his Species Plantarum. , there are 230 accepted species in Kew's Plants of the World Online database. An additional 31 new species found in New Zealand were described in 2017 but are not listed in the Plants of the World Online .

Carlos Valdes portrays Cisco Ramon in The CW's Arrowverse, especially The Flash, in which he is one of the Flash's teammates. Publication history Vibe's first appearance was in Justice League of America Annual #2 (October 1984), and he was created by Gerry Conway and Chuck Patton. Fictional character biography Cisco Ramon began his career as Vibe shortly after Aquaman disbanded the original Justice League. When young Cisco heard that a new Justice League was forming in his own hometown Detroit, he decided to give up his position as the leader of a local street gang, Los Lobos, to join. What made Cisco a candidate was his metahuman ability to emit powerful vibratory shock waves. Vibe's presence on the team caused Aquaman and the Martian Manhunter to harbor some strong doubts about the new JLA, particularly after he got the League involved in a rumble with a rival gang.Justice League of America #233 (December 1984) Vibe soon proved his mettle during the League's battles against Cadre,Justice League of America #233-236 (December 1984-February 1985). DC Comics Anton AllegroJustice League of America #237-239 (July‚ÄìSeptember 1985). DC Comics and Amazo.Justice League of America #241-243 (August‚ÄìOctober 1985). DC Comics He stayed with the League through the Crisis on Infinite Earths crossover, when his powers played a vital role in defeating Despero.Justice League of America #254 (September 1986). DC Comics During Darkseid's assault on Earth during the Legends mini-series, the Justice League of America was disbanded and Cisco left his JLA comrades to seek the familiar solace of the streets. Vibe was attacked by one of Professor Ivo's androids, and became the first Justice League member to be killed in the line of duty. The Martian Manhunter brought Vibe's body back to the League's mountain sanctuary, where Vibe was laid to rest in a cryogenic chamber. Cisco's dead form has twice been resurrected by evil-doers.JLA Annual #2 (1998)Martian Manhunter vol. 2 #12 (November 1999). DC Comics One of Vibe's brothers, Armando Ramon, developed a similar set of vibratory powers. In the Trinity maxi-series, reality is altered, and a living Cisco is shown as a member of The League, an underground version of the Justice League.Trinity #25 (November 2008). DC Comics Soon after Superman, Batman and Wonder Woman return, his head is disintegrated by an energy blast, killing him again. In a Justice League of America tie-in to the \\"Blackest Night\\" storyline, Vibe was reanimated as a member of the Black Lantern Corps, rising from his coffin in the Hall of Justice.Justice League of America (vol. 2) #39 (November 2009) Alongside the Black Lantern Steel, Vibe attacked his former teammates, Gypsy and Vixen, until Doctor Light destroyed him.Justice League of America (Vol. 2) #40 (December 2009). DC Comics =The New 52= In DC's Free Comic Book Day 2012 sample during The New 52, a gatefold revealed various characters who would make an appearance in Justice League over the coming year, one of which was Vibe. Geoff Johns revealed that Vibe's return would be explored in greater detail in the third story arc of Justice League. On August 26, 2012, DC announced a new Justice League of America title which would feature Vibe. On November 5, 2012, DC announced that Vibe would star in his own ongoing monthly title. It was written by Andrew Kreisberg and drawn by Pete Woods and debuted in February 2013. In new continuity, Vibe's powers derive from being \\"caught in the event horizon of a Boom Tube\\", in which \\"interdimensional forces rewrote his DNA\\". Justice League of America's Vibe lasted for ten issues, with the final issue released on December 18, 2013. Powers and abilities As his name suggests, Vibe's powers revolve around vibration, frequency, and resonance. His powers enabled him to create shock waves of considerable strength that could shatter concrete or steel as well as affect the physical world as seismic vibrations (and even earth manipulation) or the fabric of spacetime (interdimensional, transdimensional and extradimensional portals). Vibe's reintroduction in 2013 redefined his powers as having to do with interdimensional physics. Vibe's waves have the power to disrupt the Speed Force, making him one of the few characters who poses a serious threat to the Flash. For this reason, Steve Trevor recruits him into the JLA, which exists to guard against the threat of the main Justice League going rogue.Johns, Geoff. Justice League of America #1 (2013) Amanda Waller says that \\"Cisco Ramon might be one of the most powerful super-humans on the planet. He wields vibrational powers that could in theory shake the Earth apart. And he's the only person we know of who can find and track inter-dimensional breaches.\\"Gates, Sterling. Justice League of America's Vibe #3 (2013) He is also undetectable by security cameras. In addition, his agility is above average (and he was a super breakdancer). Under Batman's secret tutelage, Vibe became a more skilled combatant. In the 2014 series The Flash, Vibe's powers first manifested as precognitive/retrocognitive visions brought-on by touch or by a strong-enough imprint. In time, he developed his powers to the point where he can produce focused waves of concussive, vibrational force and interdimensional breaches. In other media =Television= * Vibe made several non-voiced appearances in Justice League Unlimited. This version was often seen next to the Detroit League's other members (but did not get a major role in any episode). His most prominent action is in the episode \\"Flashpoint\\" helping rescue New Mexico's civilians in the aftermath of the Cadmus facility's destruction. He is also shown with fellow Detroit-era members Vixen, Steel and Gypsy in the final 'curtain call' of the series finale \\"Destroyer\\". * Vibe made an appearance in his 2-part DC Nation Shorts cartoon short Enter Extremo, voiced by Carlos Alazraqui. * In an episode of Teen Titans Go entitled \\"My Name Is Jose\\", Raven cast a spell giving Robin Vibe's powers. * Cisco Ramon appeared in Young Justice: Outsiders, voiced by Jacob Vargas. * Vibe made a non-speaking cameo appearance in Harley Quinns season 2 finale \\"The Runaway Bridesmaid\\", where he received a key to the city from the mayor of Gotham for his role in saving the city alongside the Justice League. Arrowverse Carlos Valdes as Cisco Ramon / Vibe on the CW series The Flash. Carlos Valdes portrays Cisco Ramon/Vibe in The CW's Arrowverse, being part of the main cast of The Flash. This version of the character is a mechanical engineering genius at S.T.A.R. Labs within Central City with known metahuman powers to detect anomalies within reality and sonic manipulation. He is a part of Team Flash, who support Barry Allen/The Flash saving lives and fighting crime. A talented engineer and creative mind, Cisco builds much of the Flash's equipment and is fond of assigning colorful nicknames to criminal metahumans. In season one, he becomes good friends with Barry. Although Cisco initially appears unaffected by S.T.A.R. Labs' particle accelerator blast which was behind the Flash's and many others' powers, he begins having visions of people from other timelines and is eventually revealed to be a metahuman. Cisco's abilities later helps Team Flash discover Harrison Wells is actually the future speedster Eobard Thawne/Reverse-Flash. Cisco is also shown to have a rocky relationship with his brother Dante Ramon. In season two, Cisco embraces his metahuman status and takes the \\"Vibe\\" nickname. After witnessing the abilities of his evil Earth-2 doppelg√§nger Reverb, Cisco starts developing his powers to a greater degree; learning to open dimensional portals and emit powerful destructive blasts. In season three, Cisco's relationship with Barry is temporarily strained after finding out that Barry's timeline changes lead to Dante's death. But after he changes history himself during an alien invasion, he understands why Barry did what he did and reconciles with him. He also grows more confident in using his powers offensively, to trigger visions, and to open up portals across Central City and to other worlds. In the season five finale, Cisco chooses to get rid of his powers by taking the metahuman cure he had developed earlier in the season so he can live a normal life. However, the Monitor gives Cisco his powers back in the \\"Crisis on Infinite Earths\\" crossover event so he can help avert Crisis. His character has also made appearances on other Arrowverse shows (Arrow, Legends of Tomorrow, and Supergirl). =Film= The character's Earth-3 counterpart Breakdance is shown in Justice League: Crisis on Two Earths, voiced by Carlos Alazraqui.

It is a think tank, used by policymakers and academics, performing research and analysis on global crises. ICG has described itself as \\"working to prevent wars and shape policies that will build a more peaceful world\\". It has been characterized by right-wing organizations and publications as \\"left-leaning\\" or \\"liberal\\".  Overview  The International Crisis Group (ICG) states that it provides early warning through its monthly CrisisWatch bulletin, a global conflict tracker which is designed to identify both risks of escalation and opportunities to advance peace. The organisation says that it produces detailed analysis and advice on specific policy issues that are affecting conflict or potential conflict situations; that it engages with policy-makers, regional organisations and other key actors to promote peaceful solutions to major conflicts; and that it offers new strategic and tactical thinking on intractable conflicts and crises. The ICG has been characterized by right-wing organizations and publications as \\"liberal\\" and as a \\"a left-leaning advocacy organization\\".https://freebeacon.com/culture/author-nyt-anti-israel-piece- works-group-funded-qatar/ They differentiate themselves from other Western think tanks, noting their permanent field presence, which forms the basis of the organisation's methodology. It has regional programmers covering Africa, Asia, Europe and Central Asia, Latin America and the Caribbean, the Middle East and North Africa, and the United States. , ICG had 110 staff members.  Funding  Investor and philanthropist George Soros provided the organisation's seed funding and continues to support it. The first government representative to offer financial support was Finnish President Martti Ahtisaari, in March 1994. That same year, Gareth Evans, as Foreign Minister of Australia, pledged $500,000. A January 1995 meeting in London brought many international figures together and approved a proposal for an annual budget of $8 million and 75 full-time staff. In mid-1995, the organisation was formally registered in the U.S. as a tax-exempt non-profit. From 1996 to 1999, Crisis Group had an annual budget of around $2 million and around 20 full-time staff; by 2017 its budget had risen to over $17 million. Crisis Group received funding under grants from governments, charitable foundations, private companies and individual donors. For the financial year ending June 30, 2019, it received 43% of its funding from governments, 31% from foundations, 22% from the private sector, 2% from in-kind contributions and 2% from investment income. In a 2014 paper for Third World Quarterly, social researcher Berit Bliesemann de Guevara writes that ICG's significant budget was a requirement of its activities, though small compared to government research agencies. She notes that \\"Critics have argued that it is not the amount but the sources of the ICG's funding which have opened Western policymakers' doors to its advocacy, while at the same time (possibly) compromising the ICG's political independence\\". She notes that the ICG has \\"contradict[ed] the idea of simple, straightforward connections between donors and reporting\\" through the broad variety of its donors.  Organisation  = Offices = Crisis Group is headquartered in Brussels, with advocacy offices in Washington DC, New York and London. Other legally registered offices are based in Bogota, Colombia; Dakar, Senegal; Istanbul, Turkey; and Nairobi, Kenya. As of June 2018, Crisis Group has a presence in Abu Dhabi, Abuja, Bangkok, Beirut, Caracas, Gaza City, Guatemala City, Hong Kong, Jerusalem, Johannesburg, Juba, Kabul, Kiev, Mexico City, Mogadishu, Rabat, Tbilisi, Toronto, Tunis and Yangon. = Board of trustees = Robert Malley, who previously served in the Obama administration as a senior adviser, became president and CEO of ICG in January 2018. His predecessors in the position include: former UN Under-Secretary-General for Peacekeeping Operations Jean-Marie Gu√©henno, former UN High Commissioner for Human Rights and Justice of the Supreme Court of Canada Louise Arbour, and former Foreign Minister of Australia Gareth Evans. Malley had his ties to the Obama electoral campaign severed in May 2008, when it became public that Malley had been in discussions with the militant Palestinian group Hamas, listed by the U.S. State Department as a terrorist organisation.https://www.timesofisrael.com/can-one-time-proponent-of-outreach- to-islamists-get-obamas-is-strategy-in-sync/ The board of trustees is chaired by Mark Malloch Brown, former UN Deputy Secretary-General and Administrator of the United Nations Development Programme. The Vice-Chair of the Board is Ayo Obe, lawyer, columnist and TV presenter from Nigeria. Past board members have included Sandy Berger and Stephen Solarz. Chairmen emeritus are Martti Ahtisaari and Gareth Evans.  Awards  Crisis Group's \\"In Pursuit of Peace Award‚Äù was established in 2005, and is associated with a gala event in New York City. Recipients include U.S. Presidents Bill Clinton and George H.W. Bush; Hillary Clinton; former Brazilian President Lula da Silva; Nobel Peace Prize laureates Martti Ahtisaari and Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, and financier and philanthropist George Soros. Recipients for 2018 included: Frank Giustra, founder of the Radcliffe Foundation and a prolific entrepreneur and financier; and H.R.H. Prince Zeid Raad Al Hussein, UN High Commissioner for Human Rights and the Olympic Refugee and Paralympic Teams.  Research about the ICG  In 2014, the journal Third World Quarterly published a special issue about the ICG and its role in knowledge production about conflict, featuring 10 separate critiques about the ICG, ranging from its influence on foreign-policy makers, \\"manufacturing\\" crises, and the methodologies it deploys in gathering its research. The ICG's briefings and reports were described as having \\"a generally good reputation\\" among policymakers in the issue's introduction, which also notes that while academics working on conflict often cite the ICG's analysis, there is little academic research about the ICG itself.  Criticism  In 2010, Tom Hazeldine argued in an article published in New Left Review that the ICG \\"styles itself as independent and non-partisan, but has consistently championed NATO's wars to fulsome transatlantic praise\\". The ICG generated controversy in April 2013 as it awarded Myanmar President Thein Sein its \\"In Pursuit of Peace Award\\", with the award ceremony coinciding with the publication of a Human Rights Watch report of ethnic cleansing by Sein's administration. The ICG was criticised in September 2016 for its 2011 report entitled \\"The Syrian Regime's Slow-motion Suicide\\", with Nicholas Noe arguing: \\"Regrettably, ICG's overconfidence in regime suicide not only encouraged the premature and disastrous rejection of diplomacy that has helped prolong the Syria war. It also essentially abdicated the main role for which peace, promotion, and conflict mitigation NGOs exist in the first place: Advocating for strong international engagement and negotiated solutions that regard the safety of civilian populations as paramount\\".

Born in Bad Bergzabern, Rhenish Palatinate, in modern-day Germany, Culmann's father, a pastor, tutored him at home before enrolling him at the military engineering school at Metz to prepare for entry to the √âcole Polytechnique. Culmann's ambitions were frustrated by an attack of typhoid and, after a long convalescence, he attended the Karlsruhe Polytechnic School. He joined the Bavarian civil service in 1841 as an apprentice engineer in the design of railroad bridges.Hartenberg (1981) Continuing his mathematical studies, in particular under L. C. Schn√ºrlein, in 1847 Culmann transferred to Munich so that he could improve his English in anticipation of a study tour to the United Kingdom and the United States. His tour lasted from 1849 to 1851, studying the comparative designs of truss bridges and developing new analytical techniques to facilitate his investigations. In 1855, he took up the chair of engineering sciences at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology, Z√ºrich, holding the post until his death. Inspired by the work of Jean-Victor Poncelet, Culmann was a pioneer of graphical methods in engineering, publishing his seminal book on the topic, Die graphische Statik (Graphic Statics) in 1865.

Representing the Democratic Party, he was the dominant force in the city's politics for most of the first half of the 20th century, during which the city had a commission form of government. He also usually dominated Tennessee politics from the 1920s to the 1940s. He was elected and served as mayor of Memphis from 1910 to 1915 and again briefly in 1940. However, he effectively appointed every mayor who was elected from 1915 to 1954. Career A native of Holly Springs in northern Mississippi, where he was born in 1874, Crump, at the age of 19, moved to Memphis, Tennessee on September 21, 1893, according to the Holly Springs Reporter.William D. Miller, Mr. Crump of Memphis (Baton Rouge: Louisiana State University Press, 1964) p. 25. When he first arrived in Memphis, the ongoing Panic of 1893, the worst recession in the United States history to that time, made it hard for Crump to find work. Eventually, he obtained a clerical position with Walter Goodman Cotton Company located on Front Street in downtown Memphis.William D. Miller, Mr. Crump of Memphis, p. 34. This was the start of a successful business career as a broker and trader. In early 1901, Crump began seriously courting a 23-year-old young woman by the name of Bessie Byrd McLean. Bessie, or \\"Betty,\\" McLean was a prominent Memphis socialite and has been described as \\"one of the city's most beautiful and most sought after women.\\"William D. Miller, Mr. Crump of Memphis, p. 38. She was the only child of Mr. and Mrs. Robert McLean. Her father was then serving as the vice president of the William R. Moore Dry Goods Company. Crump and McLean were married on January 22, 1902, at the Calvary Episcopal Church. Politics Alongside his rising business career, Crump began to make the political connections that served him for the rest of his life. He was a delegate to the Tennessee Democratic State Convention in 1902 and 1904. In 1905, he was named to the municipal Board of Public Works, and was elected to the powerful position of Commissioner of Fire and Police in 1907, among three commissioners who governed the city.David Tucker, \\"Edward Hull 'Boss' Crump,\\" Tennessee Encyclopedia of History and Culture. Starting in the 1910s, Crump began to build a political machine which came to have statewide influence. He was particularly adept in his use of what were at the time two politically weak minority groups in Tennessee: blacks and Republicans. Unlike most Southern Democrats of his era, Crump was not opposed to blacks voting; Memphis blacks were reliable Crump machine voters for the most part. The party often paid the poll taxes required by state law since the late 1880s; otherwise this requirement resulted in disenfranchising many poor blacks. One of Crump's lieutenants in the black community was funeral director N. J. Ford, whose family (in the persons of several sons, including Harold Sr. and John Ford, daughter Ophelia, and grandson Harold, Jr.) became influential in Memphis, state and national politics, continuing to be so today. A symbiotic relationship developed in which blacks aided Crump, and he aided them, as was usual in politics. Crump also skillfully manipulated Republicans, who were numerically very weak in the western two-thirds of the state due to the disenfranchisement of blacks, but dominated politics in East Tennessee. Frequently, they found it necessary to align with Crump in order to accomplish any of their goals in the state government. Crump was influential for nearly half a century. He usually preferred to work behind the scenes and served only three two-year terms as mayor of Memphis (1910-1915) at the beginning of his career. He essentially named the next several mayors. His rise to prominence disturbed many of the state political leaders in Nashville. The \\"Ouster Law\\", designed to remove officials who refused to enforce state laws, was passed primarily with Crump and his lax enforcement of state Prohibition in mind. He was county treasurer of Shelby County from 1917 to 1923. He was elected seven times as a delegate to the Democratic National Convention. Crump became involved in earnest in state politics during the 1928 gubernatorial election when Henry Horton was seeking election in his own right. Horton had earlier been speaker of the state senate and succeeded to the position of governor when Austin Peay died in office. Crump supported Hill McAlister in the Democratic primary, while the Nashville machine of Luke Lea supported Governor Horton. Horton won the primary despite the strong vote for McAlister in populous Shelby County. When Horton ran for reelection in 1930, Crump and Lea cut a deal, and Crump swung his formidable political machine behind Horton.Lee, David D. (1979). Tennessee in Turmoil: Politics in the Volunteer State, 1920-1932. Memphis, TN: Memphis State University Press. 204 p. Horton defeated independent Democrat L. E. Gwinn in the primary and Republican C. Arthur Bruce in the general election. After years of working behind the scenes, Crump decided to run for U.S. Representative in 1930. He was easily elected to the Tenth District, which was then co-extensive with Shelby County (it became the Ninth in 1932). He served two terms: from March 4, 1931, to January 3, 1935. (The Twentieth Amendment was enacted in 1933, shifting the starting date of Congressional terms.) During this time, he was also a regent of the Smithsonian Institution. He remained hugely influential in Memphis as well. He was in constant communication with his operatives there and visited during each congressional recess. In 1936, Crump was named to the Democratic National Committee, serving on that body until 1945. In 1939, he was elected a final time as mayor, although that term was officially served by Walter Chandler. Chandler was U.S. Representative for the Ninth District, and Crump thought that Chandler's time was better spent tending to congressional matters in Washington than campaigning for mayor in Memphis. So, without a platform, without a speech, and without opposition, Crump was elected mayor of Memphis.Currotto, William F. 2000. Mr. Ed of Memphis: The Red Snapper or the Red Headed Man, 1874-1954. Crump was sworn in at a few minutes past midnight on January 1, 1940, in a snow storm on the platform of the railroad station, just before leaving for New Orleans to see the Sugar Bowl. In high humor, he resigned immediately. Vice Mayor Joseph Boyle became Mayor until the next day, when the faithful City Commission met and elected Chandler. Watkins Overton's term had ended at midnight, and thus Memphis had four mayors in less than twenty-four hours. Crump's statewide influence began to wane in the late 1940s. Edward J. Meeman, editor of the Memphis Press-Scimitar, opposed Crump's initiatives and called for a city manager government and abolition of the poll tax to weaken the power of the machine. He also worked to unseat U. S. Senator Tom Stewart, whom Crump supported in the 1948 Democratic primary against his intra-party challenger, U.S. Representative Estes Kefauver. Gordon Browning, a one-time prot√©g√© whom Crump had helped elect governor in 1936, was elected governor again in 1948, this time over Crump's opposition. For the rest of his life, Crump's influence was largely limited to Memphis. In 1952, his longtime associate, Senator Kenneth McKellar, was defeated in the Democratic primary ‚Äî in those days with a practically powerless state Republican party, the real contest in Tennessee ‚Äî by Congressman Albert Gore, Sr. A final triumph for Crump was the victory in 1952 of his chosen candidate, Frank G. Clement in the gubernatorial primary over Browning. Crump died less than two years later. He is interred at Elmwood Cemetery in Memphis. Political machine From the 1910s to the 1950s, Memphis was a locus of machine politics under the direction of \\"Boss\\" Crump, a Democrat. He obtained a state law in 1911 to establish a small commission to manage the city. The city retained a form of commission government until 1967, but Crump was in full control at all times. He used all of the familiar techniques of the big city boss: ballot manipulation, patronage for friends, and frustrating bureaucratic obstacles for the opposition. Crump built a complex alliance with established power figures at the local, state, and national levels. He ensured that dissidents had little or no voice. At the center of his network was \\"Cotton Row,\\" the business elite that dominated the cotton industry. Secondly, he included the modernizers: business-oriented progressives who were most concerned with upgrading the city's waterfront, parks, highways, and skyscrapers, as well as a moderately good school system. Working-class whites got their share of jobs, but labor unions had marginal influence. Roger Biles argues that the political system was virtually unchanged from 1910 into the 1950s and 1960s, thanks to Crump's wire-pulling. Crump was the leading Tennessee supporter of Franklin Roosevelt and the New Deal. In return, the city received ample relief programs, which provided jobs for the unemployed, as selected by machine lieutenants. The city also got major federal building projects, which helped to fund the business community. Crump incorporated the black leadership in his outer circle by dispensing patronage in return for (i.e., buying) the black vote. Memphis was one of the largest southern cities in which blacks could vote, although segregation was as rigid as elsewhere in the South. Legacy Statue of E.H. Crump in Overton Park, Memphis, Tennessee. *Crump was a strong supporter of fire service and for many years the Memphis Fire Department was considered one of the best in the country; it still has a high reputation. *He believed that separate operations for each municipal utility were inherently inefficient and combined them; in the early 21st century, Memphis Light, Gas and Water is one of the largest combined municipal utilities in the United States. *Crump thought that cities should not be too noisy; Memphis has strong noise ordinances that are more aggressively enforced than those of many other jurisdictions. *He was an early supporter of requiring automobile safety inspections; all of Memphis-registered vehicles were inspected annually (twice a year until the 1990s), until June 28, 2013, when all city inspections ceased after a de-funding of the department by the Memphis City Council. *The city's Crump Stadium, E.

It is best known for its highly regarded nature documentaries, including The Blue Planet and Planet Earth, and has a long association with David Attenborough's authored documentaries, starting with 1979's Life on Earth. The Natural History Unit is a specialist department within BBC Factual Production, which is itself part of BBC Studios. Each year it produces around 100 hours of television and 50 hours of radio programmes, making it the largest wildlife documentary production house in the world. The BBC commissions programmes from the Unit for broadcast on five terrestrial television channels (BBC One, BBC Two, BBC Four, CBBC and CBeebies) and BBC Radio 4. Content is marketed internationally under the BBC Earth brand by the corporation's commercial arm, BBC Studios. Original content is also broadcast on the Earth Unplugged YouTube channel. The Unit has been based in Broadcasting House, Bristol since its formation in 1957, and has been headed by Julian Hector since 2016. History =First steps in natural history broadcasting= The BBC natural history unit's links to Bristol date back to the 1940s, when Desmond Hawkins, then a young producer, joined the West Region staff. His personal interest in the subject led to a radio series called The Naturalist, which began on the Home Service in 1946 and proved an immediate success, later augmented by Out of Doors and Birds in Britain. By the early 1950s, Hawkins had been promoted to Head of Programmes, West Region and was keen to translate his success to the developing medium of television. At the time, radio still commanded much higher audiences than the fledgling television service, but Hawkins was not alone in recognising the potential for natural history programmes for the newer medium. His vision was shared by Frank Gillard, the regional Head, and the two men would become the driving force behind the establishment of the Natural History Unit (NHU) in Bristol. Until such formalities were completed, natural history programmes were the responsibility of the Features office of the West Region. One of the first programmes was an outside broadcast from the Wildfowl and Wetlands Trust's centre at Slimbridge in 1953, the first TV collaboration between the BBC and Peter Scott. Occasional programmes continued the following year, but it was not until 1955 that the BBC began a regular studio-based series, Look, presented by Scott. One of the early problems for the Unit was the difficulty in sourcing film stock. At the time, the only wildlife cameramen were amateurs, and the footage wasn't always good enough for broadcast. The embryo unit's first film camera, a clockwork Bolex, was bought from a Bristol camera shop with petty cash by Desmond's assistant, Tony Soper. Some of Scott's own expedition films were used for early episodes of Look. One particularly outstanding film from 1955, shot by Heinz Sielmann, showed woodpeckers inside a nest hole. =Unit formation= By 1957, with Look firmly established and Gillard and Hawkins lobbying hard, the BBC management in London approved the official formation of a Natural History Unit. Gillard was on the search for a senior producer to head the new Unit, and asked David Attenborough to take on the role. Attenborough had good credentials (he was a trained zoologist) but declined, having recently settled in London with his young family. Instead, he was placed in charge of the newly formed Travel and Exploration Unit, striking a deal which would allow him to continue to film his popular Zoo Quest (1954‚Äì1963) series alongside natural history output from the fledgling Bristol unit. The Travel and Exploration Unit in London also introduced viewers to more exotic wildlife, and made household names of the first natural history presenters. Armand and Michaela Denis filmed East African wildlife for their On Safari programmes, whilst another pioneering husband-and-wife team, Hans and Lotte Hass, created some of the first underwater films. Nicholas Crocker, a senior producer with West Region, became the Unit's first Head in September 1957. Founder members included Tony Soper (producer) and Christopher Parsons (assistant film editor), both of whom would go on to play a major part in the Unit's development. Although much of the Unit's early output concentrated on British and European wildlife, one of its first productions to be broadcast was Faraway Look featuring Peter Scott in Australia. The early programmes were limited by the available technology, but it was also a time of great experimentation in style and content, bringing the Unit notable success. Animal Magic (1962‚Äì1983), presented by Johnny Morris and Tony Soper, was a successful format for young audiences which ran for over 20 years. The Unit also collaborated with Gerald Durrell on several films of his animal-collecting expeditions, beginning with the studio-based series To Bafut for Beef (April 1958), using African footage shot by Durrell. =Colour television arrives= In the early 1960s, natural history filmmaking was being held back by the limitations of the available technology, particularly the restrictions of shooting often fast-moving subjects in poor light and spectacularly colourful subjects in black and white. The second of these problems was about to be resolved. Around the same time, the technology to broadcast and receive colour television was being developed, and the BBC made funds available to begin filming in colour to allow filmmakers to experiment with the latest equipment in preparation for the switchover. The Major (1963), produced by Parsons and filmed largely by New Forest cameraman Eric Ashby, told the story of an ancient English oak and was the Unit's first colour production. This was one of six films made for the BBC by part-time film- makers Ron Peggs and Leslie Jackman. Leslie filmed the insect sequences at his home in Paignton using specimens collected by John Burton. Colour transmission finally arrived in 1967 on BBC 2 under the stewardship of David Attenborough, who had retired from programme-making to move into BBC administration. The first natural history film to be shown in colour was Ron Eastman's The Private Life of the Kingfisher (1968), written and produced by Jeffery Boswall. Attenborough, by then controller of BBC 2, wanted to make a strong statement on BBC's second channel of the boundless possibilities that colour television offered, and recognised that natural history was the obvious subject matter to choose. He commissioned a series called The World About Us (1969‚Äì1982) that would broadcast in a 50-minute Sunday evening slot. Because of the challenge of producing enough colour material, the commission was shared between the NHU and London's Travel and Exploration Unit. The extended opportunities offered by the 50-minute format and improvements in film technology and expertise finally allowed the NHU to begin showcasing its talent. =Birth of the 'personal view' series= One of Attenborough's main achievements as Controller of BBC 2 was to commission Civilisation (1969), a major series presented by the respected art historian Kenneth Clark. It was a resounding success with critics and the public, pioneering the 'personal view' form of documentary films for television. Parsons, by then an experienced producer with the NHU, recognised the potential for a similar treatment with natural history as the subject and approached Attenborough in 1970 with the idea. Attenborough was receptive, even to the idea that he should present the series, but both men realised at that time that it was beyond the scope of the Unit's capabilities. When Attenborough resigned from his administrative duties to return to programme making at the start of 1973, planning for the proposed series resumed. It was another three years before the resourcing and financing were agreed, the outline episode scripts written (by Attenborough) and a production team in place. Parsons would serve as series producer and share production duties for the individual episodes with Richard Brock and John Sparks. Filming took place in 39 countries, featured over 650 different species and involved over 1 million miles of travel. Attenborough himself has said that if it had not been for computerised airline schedules, the series would have probably been impossible to undertake. When it was finally broadcast in 1979 on BBC 1, Life on Earth drew an audience of 15 million people in the UK and was eventually seen by an estimated 500 million people worldwide. =Building on success= The Natural History Unit made its name with Life on Earth, and was rewarded by being awarded departmental status by BBC management in December 1979. Christopher Parsons, by then its most experienced producer, became the first official Head of the Unit. It celebrated its silver jubilee in 1982 with the miniseries Flight of the Condor, and sealed its reputation as one of the foremost production companies for popular natural history films in the following decades. A succession of series have followed the format established by Life on Earth, often presented or narrated by Attenborough, and transmitted on the BBC's main channel. The Blue Planet (2001) and Planet Earth (2006) typify these signature programmes, characterised by high production values, specially-commissioned musical scores and often ground-breaking footage of wildlife from around the globe. The NHU has also diversified into other programme formats. Its Diary series have featured African big cats, elephants, orang-utans and bears in a nightly wildlife soap opera. Among of the longest-running programmes has been Wildlife on One (1977‚Äì2005) which was broadcast in a regular evening slot. The Continents strand on BBC Two has featured series on all the world's major land areas over the past eighteen years, including Spirits of the Jaguar (1996), Land of the Tiger (1997), Andes to Amazon (2000) and Wild Down Under (2003). Also on BBC Two, the annual Springwatch (since 2005) and Autumnwatch (since 2006) series have brought live pictures of British wildlife into millions of homes. =50 years of wildlife film making= In 2007, the Unit celebrated its 50th anniversary and was rewarded with a special award at the International Broadcasting Convention in recognition of its unique contribution to wildlife film and documentary making. On television, the anniversary was marked with the broadcast of Saving Planet Earth, a conservation-themed series which helped to raise over ¬£1.5 million for the BBC Wildlife Fund. In October 2007, the BBC announced that the NHU would suffer cuts of a third in both staff numbers and its ¬£37 million annual budget, as a result of the Government's decision to impose a lower than inflation increase in the television licence fee. The cutbacks were widely condemned within the media industry and by programme-makers, including David Attenborough. In response to the criticism, Keith Scholey, Factual Controller of BBC Vision, promised that the BBC would \\"continue to make and show the ambitious, large-scale, truly memorable series that audiences associate with BBC natural history output\\". Titles affected by the cuts include the BBC Two Wild strand. Productions already underway were not affected by the cuts, so the following year came Wild China, Pacific Abyss, Lost Land of the Jaguar and Big Cat Live, as well as the Unit's most ambitious radio event to date, World on the Move. Natural World also received a three-year commission from BBC Two on its 25th anniversary. Modern Era Post 2010, a greater emphasis was placed on climate change, which several special programmes broadcast focusing on the issue. More broadly, series looked at the negative effects of climate change and habitat destruction within series that did not focus solely on the topic.  Filmography  Since its inception in the 1950s, the Natural History Unit has produced a wealth of material for television, radio, and more recently, cinema. Being the first and the largest production unit devoted to natural history programme making, it maintains an extensive archive of images and sound recordings as well as film materials. The filmography article presents a chronological summary of the Unit's major television and film productions.  In production  As well as returning series such as Natural World and Springwatch and natural history content for BBC One's The One Show, the Unit has a number of television series currently in production: * Perfect Planet (5 x 60min, transmission on BBC One in 2020)'' * Frozen Planet II (6 x 60min, transmission on BBC One in 2021)'' * Planet Earth III (8 x 60min, transmission on BBC One in 2022)'' * Green Planet (5 x 60min, transmission on BBC One in 2021) * Mating Game (5 x 60min, transmission on BBC Two in 2021) * Life In Colour (3 x 60min, transmission on BBC One in 2021) * Extinction (1 x 60min, transmission on BBC One in 2021) * Prehistoric Planet (episodes and duration unknown, transmission on Apple TV+ with release year unknown)  Awards and recognition  The Natural History Unit as a whole was awarded the Gold Medal at the 2001 Royal Television Society awards for its \\"outstanding contribution over the past 44 years to broadcasting about the natural world\\". It was praised for being \\"a national resource for people's understanding and love of wildlife on our planet, and a symbol of both quality and talent in public service broadcasting\\". NHU filmmakers are regularly nominated and rewarded at film festivals such as Wildscreen, the Missoula International Wildlife Film Festival and the Jackson Hole Wildlife Film Festival and their output has been recognised by the wider broadcasting industry too, winning several Emmys and BAFTAs and the coveted Prix Italia on three occasions. Further details are provided in the relevant articles for specific series. Recognition has also come in the form of high audience viewing figures and audience approval ratings, particularly for 'blue-chip' series such as Planet Earth. When first screened in the UK it was watched by more than 8 million people. In 2008, episodes of Life in Cold Blood and the Wildlife Special miniseries Tiger: Spy in the Jungle both reportedly achieved the highest-ever audience appreciation index (AI) rating for a factual programme.

Set in the near future against the background of a British space programme, it tells the story of the first manned flight into space, supervised by Professor Bernard Quatermass of the British Experimental Rocket Group. When the spaceship that carries the first successful crew returns to Earth, two of the three astronauts are missing, and the third ‚Äì Victor Carroon ‚Äì is behaving strangely. It becomes apparent that an alien presence entered the rocket during its flight, and Quatermass and his associates must prevent the alien from destroying the world. Originally comprising six half-hour episodes, it was the first science fiction production to be written especially for a British adult television audience. Previous written-for-television efforts such as Stranger from Space (1951‚Äì52) were aimed at children, whereas adult entries into the genre were adapted from literary sources, such as R.U.R. (1938 and again in 1948) and The Time Machine (1949). The serial was the first of four Quatermass productions to be screened on British television between 1953 and 1979. It was transmitted live from the BBC's original television studios at Alexandra Palace in London, one of the final productions before BBC television drama moved to west London. As well as spawning various remakes and sequels, The Quatermass Experiment inspired much of the television science fiction that succeeded it, particularly in the United Kingdom, where it influenced successful series such as Doctor Who and Sapphire and Steel. It also influenced successful Hollywood films such as 2001: A Space Odyssey and Alien. Production The serial was written by BBC television drama writer Nigel Kneale, who had been an actor and an award-winning fiction writer before joining the BBC. The BBC's Head of Television Drama, Michael Barry, had committed most of his original script budget for the year to employing Kneale. An interest in science, particularly the idea of 'science going bad', led Kneale to write The Quatermass Experiment. The project originated when a gap formed in the BBC's schedules for a six-week serial to run on Saturday nights during the summer of 1953, and Kneale's idea was to fill it with \\"a mystifying, rather than horrific\\" storyline. Rudolph Cartier, one of the BBC's best-regarded directors, directed the serial. He and Kneale had collaborated on the play Arrow to the Heart, and worked closely on the initial storyline to make it suit the television production methods of the time. Kneale claimed to have picked his leading character's unusual last name at random from a London telephone directory. He chose the character's first name, Bernard, in honour of astronomer Bernard Lovell. The working titles for the production were The Unbegotten and Bring Something Back...!, the latter a line of dialogue spoken in the second episode. Kneale had not finished scripting the serial's final two episodes before the first episode was broadcast. The production had an overall budget of just under ¬£4000.Equivalent to approximately ¬£100,000 , according to the Bank of England inflation calculator tool . By comparison, the BBC's drama commissioning notes for independent producers, , specify a budget of ¬£500,000 ‚Äì ¬£800,000 per hour for a drama airing at 9pm on BBC One, five to eight times more than the amount spent on the whole of The Quatermass Experiment. The theme music used was \\"Mars, Bringer of War\\" from Gustav Holst's The Planets. Each episode was rehearsed from Monday to Friday at the Student Movement House on Gower Street in London, with camera rehearsals taking place all day on Saturday before transmission. The episodes were then transmitted live‚Äîwith a few pre-filmed 35mm film inserts shot before and during the rehearsal period‚Äîfrom Studio A of the BBC's original television studios at Alexandra Palace in London. It was one of the last major dramas to be broadcast from the Palace, as the majority of television production was soon to transfer to Lime Grove Studios, and it was made using the BBC's oldest television cameras, the Emitrons, installed with the opening of the Alexandra Palace studios in 1936. These cameras gave a (by modern standards) poor- quality picture, with areas of black and white shading across portions of the image. The Quatermass Experiment was transmitted weekly on Saturday night from 18 July to 22 August 1953. Episode one (\\"Contact Has Been Established\\") was scheduled from 8.15 to 8.45 p.m.; episode two (\\"Persons Reported Missing\\"), 8.25‚Äì8.55 p.m.; episodes three and four (\\"Very Special Knowledge\\" and \\"Believed to be Suffering\\"), 8.45‚Äì9.15 p.m.; and the final two episodes (\\"An Unidentified Species\\" and \\"State of Emergency\\") from 9.00 to 9.30 p.m. Due to the live performances, each episode overran its slot slightly, from two minutes (episode four) to six (episode six). The long overrun of the final episode was caused by a temporary break in transmission to replace a failing microphone. Kneale later claimed that the BBC's transmission controllers had threatened to take them off the air during one significant overrun, to which Cartier replied, \\"Just let them try!\\" Some BBC documentation suggests that at least one transmitter region did cut short the broadcast of the final episode. The BBC intended that each episode be telerecorded onto 35mm film, a relatively new process that allowed for the preservation of live television broadcasts. Sale of the serial had been provisionally agreed upon with the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, and Cartier wanted the material available to use for trailers and recaps. Only poor-quality copies of the first two episodes were recorded before the idea was abandoned, although the first of these was later shown in Canada. During the telerecording of the second episode, an insect landed on the screen being filmed, and can be seen on the image for several minutes. It is very unlikely that material from the third to sixth episodes of the serial will ever be recovered to the BBC's archives. The two existing episodes are the oldest surviving examples of a multi-episodic British drama production, and some of the earliest existing examples of British television drama at all, with only a few earlier one-off plays surviving. In November 1953, it was suggested that the existing two episodes could be combined and followed with a condensed live production of the latter part of the story for a special Christmas omnibus repeat of the serial. This idea was later abandoned. Although Cartier and star Reginald Tate were keen to make an all-film omnibus version for television, this also did not come to fruition. In 1963, one of the existing episodes was selected as a representative of early British programming for the Festival of World Television at the National Film Theatre in London. Plot Reginald Tate as Professor Bernard Quatermass in a shot from the second episode, \\"Persons Reported Missing\\" Along with his laboratory assistants, Professor Bernard Quatermass anxiously awaits the return to Earth of his new rocketship and its crew, who have become the first humans to travel into space. The rocket is at first thought to be lost, having dramatically overshot its planned orbit, but eventually it is detected by radar and returns to Earth, crash-landing in Wimbledon, London. When Quatermass and his team reach the crash area and succeed in opening the rocket, they discover that only one of the three crewmen, Victor Carroon, remains inside. Quatermass and his chief assistant Paterson (Hugh Kelly) investigate the rocket's interior and are baffled by what they find: the space suits of the others are present, and the instruments on board indicate that the door was never opened in flight, but there is no sign of the other two crewmen. Carroon, gravely ill, is cared for by the Rocket Group's doctor, Briscoe (John Glen), who has been having a secret affair with Carroon's wife, Judith (Isabel Dean). It is not just Quatermass who is interested in what happened to Carroon and his crewmates; journalists such as James Fullalove (Paul Whitsun-Jones) and Scotland Yard's Inspector Lomax (Ian Colin) are also keen to hear his story. Carroon is abducted by a group of foreign agents whose government wants the information they believe obtained while travelling in space. It is clear that there is something critically wrong: he appears to have absorbed the consciousness of the other two crew members, and is slowly mutating into a plant-like alien organism. As the police chase the rapidly transforming Carroon across London, Quatermass analyses samples of the mutated creature in a laboratory, and realises that it has the ability to end all life on Earth should it spore. A television crew working on an architectural programme locates the creature in Westminster Abbey, and Quatermass and British Army troops rush in to destroy it in the hour just before it will bring about doomsday. Quatermass convinces the consciousness of the three crewmen buried deep inside the creature to turn against it and destroy it. This appeal to the remnants of their humanity succeeds in defeating the organism. =Episode list= Cast and crew Following the success of The Quatermass Experiment, Nigel Kneale became one of the best-regarded screenwriters in the history of British television. In addition to the various Quatermass spin-offs and sequels, he wrote acclaimed productions such as Nineteen Eighty-Four (1954) and The Stone Tape (1972). A tribute article by writer and admirer Mark Gatiss, published on the BBC News Online website shortly after Kneale's death in 2006, praised his contribution to British television history. \\"He is amongst the greats‚Äîhe is absolutely as important as Dennis Potter, as David Mercer, as Alan Bleasdale, as Alan Bennett.\\" Kneale's actions were represented on screen in the final episode of The Quatermass Experiment. He manipulated the monster seen in Westminster Abbey at the climax, with his hands stuck through a photographic blow-up of the interior of the Abbey. The monster actually consisted of gloves covered in various plant and other materials, prepared by Kneale and his girlfriend (and future wife) Judith Kerr. The couple kept the gloves as a memento, and still owned them fifty years later, when Kneale wore them again in a television documentary about his career. Rudolph Cartier had emigrated from Germany in the 1930s to escape its Nazi regime, and joined the staff of the BBC the year before The Quatermass Experiment was made. He collaborated with Kneale on several further productions, and became a major figure in the British television industry. He directed important productions such as Kneale's Nineteen Eighty-Four adaptation, the two further BBC Quatermass serials, and one-off plays such as Cross of Iron (1961) and Lee Oswald: Assassin (1966). His 1994 obituary in The Times praised his contribution to 1950s television drama: \\"At a time when studio productions were usually as static as the conventional theatre, he was widely respected for a creative contribution to British television drama which gave it a new dimension.\\" The same piece also named The Quatermass Experiment as a high point in his career, calling the serial \\"a landmark in British television drama as much for its visual imagination as for its ability to shock and disturb.\\" Quatermass was played by the experienced Reginald Tate, who had appeared in various films, including The Way Ahead (1944). He died two years later, while preparing to take the role of the Professor again in Quatermass II. Tate was the second choice for the part; Cartier had previously offered it to Andr√© Morell, who declined the role. (Morell did later play Quatermass in the third instalment of the series, Quatermass and the Pit.) Victor Carroon was played by Scottish actor Duncan Lamont, who later appeared in the film Mutiny on the Bounty (1962), and as a different character in the film adaptation of Quatermass and the Pit (1967). He enjoyed working on The Quatermass Experiment so much that, although he was not required for the final episode, he went to Alexandra Palace to lend moral support. While there, he helped Kneale and Kerr to prepare their 'monster' prop. Appearing in a small role as a drunk was Wilfrid Brambell, who later appeared as a tramp in Quatermass II. Brambell, who also appeared in Cartier and Kneale's production of Nineteen Eighty-Four, later became widely known for his roles in the sitcom Steptoe and Son (1962‚Äì74) and the film A Hard Day's Night (1964). The 74-year-old actress Katie Johnson played a supporting part; she later became well known and won a British Film Award for her role as the landlady Mrs. Louisa Wilberforce in the film The Ladykillers (1955). Reception and influence The Quatermass Experiment achieved favourable viewing figures in 1953, opening with an estimated audience of 3.4 million for the first episode, increasing to 5 million for the sixth and final episode, and averaging 3.9 million for the entire serial. The Times estimated that one year before The Quatermass Experiment was broadcast, in August 1952, the total television audience consisted of about 4 million people. In March of that year, the BBC estimated that an average of 2.25 million people watched BBC programmes each evening. In 1954 Cecil McGivern, the Controller of Programmes at BBC Television, referred to the success of the serial in a memo discussing the impending launch of a new commercial television channel, ending the BBC's monopoly. \\"Had competitive television been in existence then, we would have killed it every Saturday night while The Quatermass Experiment lasted. We are going to need many more 'Quatermass Experiment' programmes.\\"Quoted in Following Kneale's death in 2006, film historian Robert Simpson said that the serial had been \\"event television, emptying the streets and pubs for the six weeks of its duration.\\" When the digital television channel BBC Four remade the serial in 2005, the channel's controller, Janice Hadlow, described the original as \\"one the first 'must-watch' TV experiences that inspired the water cooler chat of its day\\". Viewers' responses were generally positive. Letters praising the production were sent to the BBC's listings magazine, the Radio Times, while the writer and producer were also applauded by readers of TV News magazine, which nominated them for one of the publication's \\"TV Bouquet\\" awards. Looking back at The Quatermass Experiment in a 1981 article for The Times, journalist Geoffrey Wansell highlighted the finale: > \\"Westminster Abbey undoubtedly dominated television during the summer of > 1953 but it was not just the Coronation of the Queen that sticks in my mind > now. It is also the memory of Professor Bernard Quatermass grappling with > the pulsating giant plant that threatened to destroy the world from its > rooting place in the Abbey's nave‚Ä¶ The Quatermass Experiment frightened the > life out of a vast new generation of television viewers whose sets had been > acquired in order to watch the Coronation‚Ä¶ Quatermass was one of the first > series on British television to make life seem potentially terrifying.\\" Subsequent audience research showed that technical problems interrupting the final episode's broadcast had a negative impact on audiences' views of the serial; the audience felt that the climax had been spoiled. Despite such problems‚Äîand the existence of only the first two episodes in the archives‚ÄîThe Quatermass Experiment continued to earn critical praise in the decades following its transmission. The British Film Institute's \\"Screenonline\\" website describes the serial as \\"one of the most influential series of the 1950s\\", adding that \\"with its originality, mass appeal and dynamism, The Quatermass Experiment became a landmark of science fiction and the cornerstone of the genre on British television.\\" The website of the Museum of Broadcast Communications praises the serial's underlying themes as its most effective feature. \\"The Quatermass Experiment's depiction of an Englishman's transformation into an alienated monster dramatized a new range of gendered fears about Britain's postwar and post-colonial security. As a result, or perhaps simply because of Kneale and Cartier's effective combination of science fiction and poignant melodrama, audiences were captivated.\\" The website also points to the programme's influence on the British science- fiction television productions that followed, claiming that \\"with [The Quatermass Experiment] began a British tradition of science fiction television which runs in various forms from Quatermass to A for Andromeda to Blake's 7, and from Doctor Who to Red Dwarf.\\" Kneale disliked Doctor Who‚Äîthe most successful of the British science-fiction programmes‚Äîsaying that it had stolen his ideas. An article for The Daily Telegraph in 2005 described Doctor Who as the \\"spiritual successor\\" to the Quatermass serials, and Mark Gatiss, a scriptwriter for Doctor Who, wrote of his admiration of Kneale in an article for The Guardian in 2006. \\"Kneale wrote that [1953] was 'an over-confident year' and he piloted his hugely influential tale like a rocket into the drab schedules of Austerity Britain‚Ä¶ What sci-fi piece of the past 50 years doesn't owe Kneale a huge debt?\\" In 2007, Gatiss appeared as the character Professor Lazarus in the Doctor Who episode \\"The Lazarus Experiment\\". The Radio Times noted in its preview of the episode that \\"Tonight's story is an enjoyable synthesis of She, The Fly and The Quatermass Experiment‚Äîeven down to the final battle in a London cathedral.\\" Other media The popularity of The Quatermass Experiment gained the attention of the film industry, and Hammer Film Productions quickly purchased the rights to make an adaptation. It was released in 1955, and starred the American actor Brian Donlevy, supported by the English actor Jack Warner, with Val Guest directing and co-writing the screenplay. Nigel Kneale was unhappy with the result, and was especially displeased with the casting of Donlevy as Quatermass. He stated in an interview, \\"[Donlevy] was then really on the skids and didn't care what he was doing. He took very little interest in the making of the films or in playing the part. It was a case of take the money and run. Or in the case of Mr Donlevy, waddle.\\" The film was titled The Quatermass Xperiment to emphasise its X-certificate status. In America the film was renamed The Creeping Unknown after the title Shock! was considered for that territory, and an alternative opening title sequence with that name was prepared. The BBC was also pleased with the success of The Quatermass Experiment and in 1955 a sequel, Quatermass II, was broadcast, with John Robinson in the title role following Tate's death. This was followed in 1958 by Quatermass and the Pit, and both serials also had feature film versions made by Hammer. The character returned to television in a 1979 serial, simply titled Quatermass, for Thames Television. A script book of The Quatermass Experiment, containing several production stills from the missing episodes, was published by Penguin Books in 1959. To coincide with the broadcast of the Thames serial, it was republished in 1979 with a new introduction by Kneale. In April 2005, BBC Worldwide released a boxed set of all their Quatermass material on DVD, containing digitally restored versions of the two existing episodes of The Quatermass Experiment, the two subsequent BBC serials, and various extra material, including PDF files of photocopies of the original scripts for episodes three to six. However, the quality of these photocopies is in some cases quite poor. On 2 April 2005, the digital television channel BBC Four broadcast a live remake of the serial, abridged to a single special, also entitled The Quatermass Experiment.

He helped establish Cumberland University in 1842, serving as the first president of its board of trustees, and was a cofounder of the Cumberland School of Law, one of the oldest law schools in the South. He served as a Tennessee state attorney general in the late 1820s and early 1830s, and was a justice of the Tennessee Supreme Court in the 1850s and early 1860s. He also served one term in the United States House of Representatives (1841-1843). In 1863, he was elected Governor of Tennessee by the state's Confederates, but never took office.Phillip Langsdon, Tennessee: A Political History (Franklin, Tenn.: Hillsboro Press, 2000), pp. 162-163. Early life and career Robert Looney Caruthers was born near Carthage, Tennessee, the youngest of seven children of Samuel and Elizabeth Looney Caruthers. His father had represented Sullivan County at the constitutional convention of the State of Franklin in the 1780s.John W. Green, \\"Judges Robert L. Caruthers and Archibald Wright.\\" Accessed: 16 October 2012. After his death, Robert went to live with an uncle in Columbia, Tennessee, where he attended Woodward Academy. He later attended Washington College near Jonesborough and Greeneville College in Greeneville, and studied law under Judge Samuel Powell in Greeneville. Caruthers returned to Carthage in 1823 to practice law. He served as the clerk for the Tennessee House of Representatives for the 1823-1824 term, and worked as editor of the Tennessee Republican newsletter. In 1826, he moved to Lebanon, Tennessee, and married Sally Sanders, a niece of Andrew Jackson's wife, Rachel Donelson Jackson.Ligon and Bobo: About Us. Retrieved: 16 October 2012. That same year, he was appointed attorney general for the Sixth Judicial District (based in Lebanon) by Governor Sam Houston. He served in this position until 1832. In 1834, he was elected brigadier general in the Tennessee militia. In 1836, he and Alfred O. P. Nicholson published A Compilation of the Statutes of Tennessee, which remained the state's standard compilation of statutes for over two decades.A. V. Goodpasture, \\"An Account of the Compilation of the Statute Laws of Tennessee,\\" American Historical Magazine and Tennessee Historical Society Quarterly, Vol. 7, No. 1 (January 1901), p. 74. In 1835, Caruthers was elected to the Tennessee House of Representatives, representing Wilson County. He served on the House Judiciary Committee, and did not seek reelection. He was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives for Tennessee's 7th District for the 1841-1843 term. Once again, he served just one term, and did not seek reelection. In 1844, he was the Whig elector for Tennessee's at-large district, and as such, canvassed the state for unsuccessful presidential candidate Henry Clay. In 1852, Caruthers was appointed by Governor William B. Campbell to fill the term of Nathan Green (who had retired) as Middle Tennessee's justice of the Tennessee Supreme Court. The following year, the state legislature voted to give Caruthers a full term. In 1854, after the state constitution was amended to allow popular election of justices, Caruthers managed to win reelection to the court. One of Caruthers' most important decisions on the court was his opinion in Rippy v. State (1858), which involved killing in self-defense. In this decision, he rejected a literal interpretation of a statement in Judge John Catron's opinion in Grainger v. State, issued three decades earlier, that suggested a person did not need sufficient grounds to kill in self-defense, but merely needed to testify that there was imminent danger. Caruthers' opinion reinstated the \\"sufficient grounds\\" rule. He wrote of Grainger, \\"no case has been more perverted and misapplied by advocates and juries.\\"Timothy Huebner, \\"Grainger v. State,\\" Tennessee Encyclopedia of History and Culture, 2009. Retrieved: 16 October 2012. Prior to the outbreak of the Civil War, Caruthers was a delegate to the Washington Peace Convention in February 1861, which sought to find a peaceful resolution to the sectional strife between the North and South. He remained pro-Union until the Battle of Fort Sumter in April 1861, after which he aligned himself with the Confederacy.\\"The Rebel Governor, Caruthers,\\" Memphis Bulletin, 16 September 1863.

Caruthers was officially elected on August 6, but the state constitution required that the governor-elect take the oath of office before the General Assembly. Since the Union Army controlled most of Middle and West Tennessee at this time, the Assembly was unable to convene, and Caruthers never officially took office. Confederates continued to recognize Harris as governor until the end of the war. Union forces, in the meantime, had installed Andrew Johnson as military governor. Cumberland University Cumberland University was established in Lebanon by the Cumberland Presbyterian Church in 1842. Winstead Paine Bone, in his book, A History of Cumberland University, wrote that Caruthers, a member of the Cumberland Presbyterian Church, \\"had more to do with the founding of Cumberland University than any other person.\\"Winstead Paine Bone, A History of Cumberland University (Nashville: Parthenon Craftsmen, 1935), pp. 40-42. He was appointed president of the school's first board of trustees in the Summer of 1842, and helped the school secure a charter in December of the following year. He remained president of the board until his death in 1882. In 1847, Caruthers and his brother, Abraham Caruthers, founded the Cumberland School of Law, one of the first law schools in the South.Frank Burns, \\"Cumberland University Law School,\\" Tennessee Encyclopedia of History and Culture, 2009. Retrieved: 16 October 2012. The school, which had an initial enrollment of seven students, held its first classes in Robert Caruthers' law office. As an instructor, Abraham Caruthers abandoned the lecture system, and instead assigned a chapter from a law text, and quizzed each student on the chapter the following day, considering this the best way to determine the areas in which a student was struggling. He also held moot courts. During the Civil War, Nathan Green, Jr., whose father had been succeeded by Robert Caruthers on the Tennessee Supreme Court in 1852, managed to keep the school open. Caruthers joined the Cumberland School of Law's faculty as a Professor of Law in 1868, replacing Judge Henry Cooper.Lucius Salisbury Merriam, Higher Education in Tennessee (Washington: Government Printing Office, 1893), pp. 196 In 1878, in memory of his brother, Abraham, he funded the construction of Caruthers Hall, which housed the law school for several decades. He resigned from the faculty in 1880. In 1961, Cumberland University sold the law school to Birmingham-based Samford University. Death and legacy The Caruthers House (2010) Caruthers died in Lebanon on October 2, 1882. He was buried in the city's Cedar Grove Cemetery.

He is also known for his work in the theory of statistical inference and in multivariate analysis. Biography Born in London, Bartlett was raised in a poor family but won a scholarship to Latymer Upper School in Hammersmith, where he was inspired to the study of statistics by a chapter in Hall and Knight's Algebra. In 1929, he won a scholarship to Queens' College, Cambridge where he read mathematics, graduating with the rank of wrangler. He attended lectures on statistics by John Wishart, on relativity by Arthur Eddington and on quantum mechanics by Paul Dirac. In one of his lectures Wishart described his geometric derivation of the Wishart distribution. Overnight Bartlett worked out a proof using characteristic functions. Bartlett was Wishart's first post-graduate student and they wrote two papers together. This was the beginning of Bartlett's involvement with multivariate analysis. During his Queens years, he rowed for the college. In 1933, Bartlett was recruited by Egon Pearson to the new statistics department at University College, London. Pearson was already working with Jerzy Neyman. Also in the college were Ronald A. Fisher and J. B. S. Haldane. Bartlett was stimulated by all of them, most of all by the work of Fisher, criticising some of it (for example, fiducial inference) while developing other parts (for example conditional inference). Relations between the two men fluctuated; sometimes Bartlett was in Fisher's good books, but often not. In 1934, Bartlett became statistician at the ICI agricultural research station at Jealott's Hill. Not only did he deal with practical problems but he worked on statistical theory, as well as on problems in genetics but he became interested in the characterisation of intelligence. He remembered Jealott's Hill as the best working environment of his career. Bartlett left ICI for the University of Cambridge in 1938 but at the outset of World War II was mobilised into the Ministry of Supply, conducting rocket research alongside Frank Anscombe, David Kendall and Pat Moran. After the war Bartlett's renewed Cambridge work focused on time-series analysis and stochastic process. With Jo Moyal he planned a large book on probability, but the collaboration did not work out and Bartlett went ahead and published his own book on stochastic processes. He made a number of visits to the United States. In 1947 he became professor of mathematical statistics at the University of Manchester where he not only developed his interests in epidemiology but also served as an able and active administrator. In 1960, he took up the chair of statistics at University College, London before serving the last eight years of his academic life as professor of biomathematics at the University of Oxford. He retired in 1975. After his retirement Bartlett remained active in statistics, visiting the Institute of Advanced Studies at the Australian National University several times. He had married Sheila, daughter of C. E. Chapman, in 1957, the couple parenting a daughter. Bartlett died in Exmouth, Devon. Bartlett is known for Bartlett's method for estimating power spectra and Bartlett's test for homoscedasticity.

Television Beck portrayed Perry White, Clark Kent's boss in Filmation's The New Adventures of Superman animated series and was narrator as well. He was the announcer for the first season of Tom Corbett, Space Cadet on television. Film In 1966, Beck dubbed the English voice of the judge listing Tuco's many crimes before sentencing him to death by hanging in The Good, the Bad and the Ugly, and used his deep, dramatic, modulated voice as the narrator of Woody Allen's Take the Money and Run in 1969. He also narrated the cult comedy film Cry Uncle! in 1971, and was one of the players in National Lampoon's first comedy album Radio Dinner in 1972. He was prominent as well in Allen's 1987 film Radio Days, dubbing the voice of the on-the-spot newsman. Animation Beck had a prolific career in animation, becoming one of the regular voice actors at Famous Studios in the mid-1940s. He voiced Bluto in the Popeye cartoons, Little Lulu's father, the fox in the Baby Huey cartoons, and Buzzy the Crow, who was a foil for Katnip the Cat in a number of cartoons. Beck used a black dialect for the voice of Buzzy. He was also the voice of King Leonardo in the 1960s TV cartoon series of the same name. He also had a part in the Peanuts 1977 film Race for Your Life, Charlie Brown as the snickering cat, Brutus. He narrated the 1980s G.I. Joe animated TV series. His other voice work included network TV promos (he did a series of promos for NBC's NFL coverage for much of the 1980s), narration for sketches on Saturday Night Live, movie trailers, and commercials for everything from toys to shampoo (one of Beck's very last commercials was for Infusium Shampoo).

He was a Taoist and one of the founders of the Quanzhen School in the 12th century during the Jin dynasty (1115‚Äì1234). He was one of the Five Northern Patriarchs of Quanzhen. He also appears as a character in works of wuxia fiction. Name * Family name: Wang () * Given names: Zhongfu (); Dewei (); Zhe () * Courtesy names: Yunqing (); Shixiong (); Zhiming () * Pseudonym: Chongyangzi () Life Wang was born with his birth name as \\"Zhongfu\\" in a wealthy family in 1113. He was educated in Chinese classics and martial arts. Wang intended to start a rebellion against the Jurchen Jin dynasty, which conquered northern China in the Jin‚ÄìSong Wars.Jing-shen Tao, \\"The Jurchen in Twelfth-Century China\\". University of Washington Press, 1976, . Pages 106-107. According to tradition, in the summer of 1159 when he was 48, he met three Taoist immortals in a tavern, Zhongli Quan, L√º Dongbin, and Liu Haichan. They trained him in secret forms of Taoism. He changed his name to \\"Zhe\\" and adopted the Taoist name \\"Chongyang\\". In 1160, Wang met one of the immortals again and was provided with a set of written instructions called \\"Ganshui Xianyuan Lu\\". Those written instructions included the names of two men who would later become his disciples (Ma Yu and Tan Chuduan). Wang built a tomb for himself near Mount Zhongnan and called it \\"Tomb of the Living Dead\\". He lived in it for three years. At the end of the three years, Wang filled the tomb with earth and built a hut on top of it and called it \\"Complete Perfection Hut\\". He spent the next four years in the hut studying Taoism and imparting his knowledge to others. During that time, he met Tan Chuduan, who became his disciple after he cured Tan from illness. Qiu Chuji and Tan traveled around the local towns and villages with Wang and founded five Taoist congregations. Wang's teachings were referred to the \\"Teachings of the Complete Perfection\\" (after the hut) and his branch of Taoism became known as the Quanzhen School. In 1167, Wang burnt down the hut and travelled east to Shandong, where he met Ma Yu and Ma's wife, Sun Bu'er. They became his disciples as well. He accepted a total of seven disciples who later became known as \\"Seven Masters of Quanzhen\\" or \\"Seven Elders of Quanzhen\\". They are also called the \\"Seven Immortals\\" or \\"Seven Perfected Beings\\". In 1187, Emperor Shizong of Jin summoned Wang's disciple Wang Chuyi (and, according to some sources, also Qiu Chuji) to preach in his inner palace. Later, he requested the presence of Wang Chuyi at his deathbed. Shizong's successor, Emperor Zhangzong, banned the teaching of Quanzhen Taoism. He considered them as causing heretical and detrimental to society;He converted to Quanzhen's teachings later and let Wang Chuyi stay in Yanjing (present-day Beijing) for a year. Shizong's grandson Wanyan Shou later wrote a biography for Wang Chongyang. He was immortalized in the Longmen Grottoes. Writings Wang was the author of many poems of Taoist instruction. According to legend, Liu Chuxuan became a follower of Wang after reading one of Wang's poems. Wang's writings include: *\\"An Anthology of Complete Perfection by Chongyang\\" (Chongyang Quanzhen Ji) *\\"Chongyang's Anthology on Teaching Transformation\\" (Chongyang Jiaohua Ji) *\\"Chongyang's Anthology of the Ten Transformations by Dividing Pears\\" (Chongyang fenli shihua ji) (The phrase \\"to divide a pear\\" is a pun for \\"to separate,\\" these were writings intended to convince Ma Yu and Sun Bu'er to separate in order to better cultivate the Dao.) Disciples Wang Chongyang and his seven disciples, depicted in Changchun Temple, Wuhan The most notable ones among Wang's seven disciples were Sun Bu'er and Qiu Chuji. Sun's husband, Ma Yu, was one of the seven, while she became an important role model for female Taoists. Ma Yu later succeeded Wang as the leader of the Quanzhen School. Qiu Chuji gained the favour of Genghis Khan and founded the White Cloud Monastery in Beijing. Genghis Khan granted tax-exempt status to all Quanzhen schools and placed Qiu in charge of all religions in China. Each of the seven disciples founded his or her own lineage of Quanzhen Taoism. They are as follows: # Ma Yu () founded the Yuxian lineage (Meeting the Immortals) # Tan Chuduan () founded the Nanwu lineage (Southern Void) # Liu Chuxuan () founded the Suishan lineage (Mount Sui) # Qiu Chuji () founded the Longmen lineage (Dragon Gate) # Wang Chuyi () founded the Yushan lineage (Mount Yu) # Hao Datong () founded the Huashan lineage (Mount Hua) # Sun Bu'er () founded the Qingjing lineage (Clarity and Stillness) In fiction =Condor Trilogy= Wang is mentioned by name in the wuxia novel The Legend of the Condor Heroes and its sequel The Return of the Condor Heroes, by Jin Yong. He was depicted as a patriotic martial artist, and one of the top five champions of the Mount Hua martial arts contest. After his death, his seven apprentices, known as the \\"Seven Immortals of Quanzhen\\", inherit his legacy and promote Quanzhen to become one of the leading orthodox sects in the jianghu (martial artists' community). In The Return of the Condor Heroes, Wang had a romantic relationship with Lin Chaoying, the founder of the Ancient Tomb Sect, in his early life. He lost to Lin in a martial arts contest and had to keep his promise to hand over his base of operations to her and become a Taoist. =Other appearances= In the manhua series Oriental Heroes by Hong Kong artist Wong Yuk-long, Wang Chongyang is noted as the creator of the 'Nine Solar Art'.

It is part of the Municipality of Lambton Shores in Lambton County.  History  Grand Bend is situated on the traditional territory of the Attawandaron and Ojibwe/Chippewa First Nations. It was ceded to the crown as part of a parcel called the Huron Tract, in Treaty 27, 1829. In the 1830s a group of English and Scottish settlers bought lots from the Canada Company, a land development firm. One of the original settlers, Benjamin Brewster gave his name to the village after he and his business partner David Smart secured rights to dam the Ausable River and started a sawmill in 1832. The villagers were mainly the families of the millhands and fisherman. Their homesteads were situated on the south side of the present village. For twenty years Brewster existed as an isolated lumbering community. Until the opening of the highway to Goderich in 1850, both people and provisions had to travel by water. Once road connections were complete, the village was no longer solely dependent on the forests for its livelihood and opportunities for new businesses emerged. Typical of many pioneer communities, the village assumed many different names throughout its history--Brewster's Mills, Websterville and Sommerville are all recorded. Early French Canadian settlers in the area referred to the present location of the village as \\"Aux Croches\\", 'at the bends'.Rayburn, Alan (1997), Place Names of Ontario (University of Toronto Press), Toronto-Buffalo-London, ), pp.140-141 Grand Bend survived as a name, perhaps because it was the most appropriate--the tight hairpin turn in the original Ausable River where mills were first established. Land ownership controversies =Noble v Alley= Improved roads and the arrival of the automobile near the turn of the century had the greatest influence on the growth of Grand Bend. Businesses were established to serve visitors and travellers along the highway, and with the beach, \\"The Bend\\" became a summer destination. In the 1940s, however, Grand Bend became the centre of a major controversy in the landmark court case of Noble v Alley. Wolf, a London, Ontario merchant, faced court challenges when he purchased property at Beach O'Pines in contravention of a restrictive covenant that prohibited the ownership of lots or cottages by persons of \\"Jewish, Hebrew, Semitic, Negro or coloured race or blood\\". The case was finally heard by the Supreme Court of Canada which ruled that the restrictive covenant as constituted was invalid.; Globe and Mail 13 June 1949, p. 5 =Gibbs v Grand Bend= In the late 1980s, a landowner went to the Supreme Court of Ontario seeking a declaration that he was the successor in title to the entire north beach of Grand Bend, amounting to , by virtue of a land grant given to the Canada Company in 1836. Although successful at trial in 1989, it was overturned at the Ontario Court of Appeal in 1995, which held that, while the beach did not constitute lands reserved to the Crown, the owners had lost ownership to it over the years because of implied dedication and acceptance for public recreational use. As he was required to give the public access to the beach, he subsequently charged parking fees to the visitors and personally cleaned up the beach every night. In 1998 he reached agreement with the province and the village of Grand Bend to sell the property. There was a separate continuing ownership dispute relating to the harbour at the mouth of the Ausable River. Main Street in Grand Bend A couple outside on the Lake Huron surf at Grand Bend, July 1951 Present day Grand Bend is home to a variety of stores and eateries. The main strip is the centre of activity in the town, with shopping during the day and night life venues during the evening drawing crowds. The atmosphere of Grand Bend has given the town a reputation of being Florida north. As well as Main Street, Grand Bend acts as a regional cultural centre, boasting art galleries in the town and the Huron Country Playhouse on the outskirts. Today, Grand Bend's year-round population of 2,000 people swells to about 50,000 in the summer months on holiday weekends. The demographic population of Grand Bend is quite diverse. Families owning vacation homes in the adjacent communities of Oakwood Park, Southcott Pines and Beach O' Pines, are from Ontario, Michigan and as far as New York, Florida, Texas and the American west coast. Among these are the Romney family. The town as well serves as the backdrop of the docu-drama MTV Show Grand Benders, filmed from 2011 to the present and produced by MDF Productions. The Pinery Provincial Park and the Lambton Heritage Museum are located seven kilometres south of Grand Bend. Also, in the vicinity one can explore a number of 'Gems of Nature' accessible by marked and maintained hiking trails. Grand Bend Motorplex has a dragstrip that hosts an International Hot Rod Association race and the IHRA Canadian Nationals, Canada's longest running and largest drag race.

It was originally scheduled as the group's first album for release in May 1988, but the master tapes were damaged in a fire, necessitating the rewriting and recording of the material, which was released as Storm the Studio. Armed Audio Warfare is actually a compilation of unreleased and rare tracks that give a flavour of how that first album may have sounded had it been released as planned.Sleeve notes to original Vinyl pressing on Wax Trax!  Composition and background  The album contains rare tracks from, or related to, various releases of the band from its inception to late 1988. According to the liner notes, \\"Genocide\\" is a \\"burnt\\" remix of \\"God O.D.\\", recorded in December 1988. The song is composed of part of the lyrics from \\"God O.D.\\" but with a darker, more industrial instrumentation, and a lack of sampling. \\"Repulsion\\" is a track previously released on a compilation by Sweatbox, the band's first record label, in May 1988. \\"Mister President\\" is a previously unreleased, sample-heavy track recorded in February 1988 with a notable clip from the introduction of Monty Python's Previous Record. The fourth track, \\"Reanimator\\", contains significant dub influences. It was to be released as part of the \\"Re-Animator\\" single in August 1988, but the single never had a commercial release.Miller, Christopher (October 1998). Meat Beat Manifesto Discography. Digital Chemist. Retrieved 5 April 2014. Tracks 5, 6, and 7 are part of the band's first release, the November 1987 Suck Hard EP, as an A-side and two B-sides, respectively. On almost all releases of Armed Audio Warfare, there is a misprint that inverts the titles of tracks 6 and 7. \\"Kneel and Buzz\\" has a raw, live sound, plus samples from the communications of the Apollo 11 mission. The title itself is a pun on the names of astronauts Neil (Armstrong) and Buzz (Aldrin). \\"Fear Version\\" is a very short, yet intense track recorded in January 1988 that was intended to be on the Suck Hard CD reissue, but the single was subsequently never released in that format. \\"Give Your Body Its Freedom\\" is cited, in the liner notes, as the original version of the track \\"Strap Down (Roar of the Underground)\\", from the June 1988 single Strap Down. The lengthy song contains live vocals, heavy sampling and distinct sections, including a rather intense buildup and climax contrasted with a calm final minute. The tenth track, \\"Marrs Needs Women\\", is the first of two tracks added to the CD reissue of Armed Audio Warfare. It is an extended version of the B-side \\"Mars Needs Women\\" from the November 1988 God O.D. single. It has a funk-oriented sound, along with samples from the films The War of the Worlds and Mars Needs Women. The eleventh and final song, \\"Cutman\\", is a previously unreleased track, with five distinct parts, densely layered samples and soul, jazz and hip-hop influences.

A session is established at a certain point in time, and then ‚Äòtorn down‚Äô - brought to an end - at some later point. An established communication session may involve more than one message in each direction. A session is typically stateful, meaning that at least one of the communicating parties needs to hold current state information and save information about the session history in order to be able to communicate, as opposed to stateless communication, where the communication consists of independent requests with responses. An established session is the basic requirement to perform a connection-oriented communication. A session also is the basic step to transmit in connectionless communication modes. However any unidirectional transmission does not define a session.Sessionless- oriented protocol and session-oriented protocol Communication Transport may be implemented as part of protocols and services at the application layer, at the session layer or at the transport layer in the OSI model. * Application layer examples: ** HTTP sessions, which allow associating information with individual visitors ** A telnet remote login session * Session layer example: ** A Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) based Internet phone call * Transport layer example: ** A TCP session, which is synonymous to a TCP virtual circuit, a TCP connection, or an established TCP socket. In the case of transport protocols that do not implement a formal session layer (e.g., UDP) or where sessions at the application layer are generally very short-lived (e.g., HTTP), sessions are maintained by a higher level program using a method defined in the data being exchanged. For example, an HTTP exchange between a browser and a remote host may include an HTTP cookie which identifies state, such as a unique session ID, information about the user's preferences or authorization level. HTTP/1.0 was thought to only allow a single request and response during one Web/HTTP Session. Protocol version HTTP/1.1 improved this by completing the Common Gateway Interface (CGI), making it easier to maintain the Web Session and supporting HTTP cookies and file uploads. Most client-server sessions are maintained by the transport layer - a single connection for a single session. However each transaction phase of a Web/HTTP session creates a separate connection. Maintaining session continuity between phases requires a session ID. The session ID is embedded within the <A HREF> or <FORM> links of dynamic web pages so that it is passed back to the CGI. CGI then uses the session ID to ensure session continuity between transaction phases. One advantage of one connection-per-phase is that it works well over low bandwidth (modem) connections.  Software implementation  TCP sessions are typically implemented in software using child processes and/or multithreading, where a new process or thread is created when the computer establishes or joins a session. HTTP sessions are typically not implemented using one thread per session, but by means of a database with information about the state of each session. The advantage with multiple processes or threads is relaxed complexity of the software, since each thread is an instance with its own history and encapsulated variables. The disadvantage is large overhead in terms of system resources, and that the session may be interrupted if the system is restarted. When a client may connect to any server in a cluster of servers, a special problem is encountered in maintaining consistency when the servers must maintain session state. The client must either be directed to the same server for the duration of the session, or the servers must transmit server-side session information via a shared file system or database. Otherwise, the client may reconnect to a different server than the one it started the session with, which will cause problems when the new server does not have access to the stored state of the old one.  Server-side web sessions  Server-side sessions are handy and efficient, but can become difficult to handle in conjunction with load-balancing/high-availability systems and are not usable at all in some embedded systems with no storage. The load-balancing problem can be solved by using shared storage or by applying forced peering between each client and a single server in the cluster, although this can compromise system efficiency and load distribution. A method of using server-side sessions in systems without mass-storage is to reserve a portion of RAM for storage of session data. This method is applicable for servers with a limited number of clients (e.g. router or access point with infrequent or disallowed access to more than one client at a time).  Client-side web sessions  Client-side sessions use cookies and cryptographic techniques to maintain state without storing as much data on the server. When presenting a dynamic web page, the server sends the current state data to the client (web browser) in the form of a cookie. The client saves the cookie in memory or on disk. With each successive request, the client sends the cookie back to the server, and the server uses the data to \\"remember\\" the state of the application for that specific client and generate an appropriate response. This mechanism may work well in some contexts; however, data stored on the client is vulnerable to tampering by the user or by software that has access to the client computer. To use client-side sessions where confidentiality and integrity are required, the following must be guaranteed: # Confidentiality: Nothing apart from the server should be able to interpret session data. # Data integrity: Nothing apart from the server should manipulate session data (accidentally or maliciously). # Authenticity: Nothing apart from the server should be able to initiate valid sessions. To accomplish this, the server needs to encrypt the session data before sending it to the client, and modification of such information by any other party should be prevented via cryptographic means. Transmitting state back and forth with every request is only practical when the size of the cookie is small. In essence, client-side sessions trade server disk space for the extra bandwidth that each web request will require. Moreover, web browsers limit the number and size of cookies that may be stored by a web site. To improve efficiency and allow for more session data, the server may compress the data before creating the cookie, decompressing it later when the cookie is returned by the client.  HTTP session token  A session token is a unique identifier that is generated and sent from a server to a client to identify the current interaction session. The client usually stores and sends the token as an HTTP cookie and/or sends it as a parameter in GET or POST queries. The reason to use session tokens is that the client only has to handle the identifier‚Äîall session data is stored on the server (usually in a database, to which the client does not have direct access) linked to that identifier. Examples of the names that some programming languages use when naming their HTTP cookie include JSESSIONID (JSP), PHPSESSID (PHP), CGISESSID (CGI), and ASPSESSIONID (ASP).  Session management  In human‚Äìcomputer interaction, session management is the process of keeping track of a user's activity across sessions of interaction with the computer system. Typical session management tasks in a desktop environment include keeping track of which applications are open and which documents each application has opened, so that the same state can be restored when the user logs out and logs in later. For a website, session management might involve requiring the user to re-login if the session has expired (i.e., a certain time limit has passed without user activity). It is also used to store information on the server-side between HTTP requests. =Desktop session management = A desktop session manager is a program that can save and restore desktop sessions. A desktop session is all the windows currently running and their current content. Session management on Linux-based systems is provided by X session manager. On Microsoft Windows systems, session management is provided by the Session Manager Subsystem (smss.exe); user session functionality can be extended by third-party applications like twinsplay. =Browser session management= Session management is particularly useful in a web browser where a user can save all open pages and settings and restore them at a later date. To help recover from a system or application crash, pages and settings can also be restored on next run. Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Internet Explorer, OmniWeb and Opera are examples of web browsers that support session management. Session management is often managed through the application of cookies. =Web server session management= Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is stateless: a client computer running a web browser must establish a new Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) network connection to the web server with each new HTTP GET or POST request. The web server, therefore, cannot rely on an established TCP network connection for longer than a single HTTP GET or POST operation. Session management is the technique used by the web developer to make the stateless HTTP protocol support session state. For example, once a user has been authenticated to the web server, the user's next HTTP request (GET or POST) should not cause the web server to ask for the user's account and password again. For a discussion of the methods used to accomplish this see HTTP cookie and Session ID In situations where multiple web servers must share knowledge of session state (as is typical in a cluster environment) session information must be shared between the cluster nodes that are running web server software. Methods for sharing session state between nodes in a cluster include: multicasting session information to member nodes (see JGroups for one example of this technique), sharing session information with a partner node using distributed shared memory or memory virtualization, sharing session information between nodes using network sockets, storing session information on a shared file system such as a distributed file system or a global file system, or storing the session information outside the cluster in a database. If session information is considered transient, volatile data that is not required for non- repudiation of transactions and does not contain data that is subject to compliance auditing (in the U.S. for example, see the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act for examples of two laws that necessitate compliance auditing) then any method of storing session information can be used. However, if session information is subject to audit compliance, consideration should be given to the method used for session storage, replication, and clustering. In a service-oriented architecture, Simple Object Access Protocol or SOAP messages constructed with Extensible Markup Language (XML) messages can be used by consumer applications to cause web servers to create sessions. =Session management over SMS= Just as HTTP is a stateless protocol, so is SMS. As SMS became interoperable across rival networks in 1999, and text messaging started its ascent towards becoming a ubiquitous global form of communication,Hppy bthdy txt! BBC News World Edition, http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/2538083.stm 3 December 2002. various enterprises became interested in using the SMS channel for commercial purposes. Initial services did not require session management since they were only one-way communications (for example, in 2000, the first mobile news service was delivered via SMS in Finland). Today, these applications are referred to as application-to-peer (A2P) messaging as distinct from peer-to- peer (P2P) messaging. The development of interactive enterprise applications required session management, but because SMS is a stateless protocol as defined by the GSM standards,GSM Doc 28/85 \\"Services and Facilities to be provided in the GSM System\\" rev2, June 1985 early implementations were controlled client-side by having the end-users enter commands and service identifiers manually.

A non-Batesian species, Pseudopieris nehemia, is in the centre. Batesian mimicry is a form of mimicry where a harmless species has evolved to imitate the warning signals of a harmful species directed at a predator of them both. It is named after the English naturalist Henry Walter Bates, after his work on butterflies in the rainforests of Brazil. Batesian mimicry is the most commonly known and widely studied of mimicry complexes, such that the word mimicry is often treated as synonymous with Batesian mimicry. There are many other forms however, some very similar in principle, others far separated. It is often contrasted with M√ºllerian mimicry, a form of mutually beneficial convergence between two or more harmful species. However, because the mimic may have a degree of protection itself, the distinction is not absolute. It can also be contrasted with functionally different forms of mimicry. Perhaps the sharpest contrast here is with aggressive mimicry, where a predator or parasite mimics a harmless species, avoiding detection and improving its foraging success. The imitating species is called the mimic, while the imitated species (protected by its toxicity, foul taste or other defenses) is known as the model. The predatory species mediating indirect interactions between the mimic and the model is variously known as the [signal] receiver, dupe or operator. By parasitizing the honest warning signal of the model, the Batesian mimic gains an advantage, without having to go to the expense of arming itself. The model, on the other hand, is disadvantaged, along with the dupe. If impostors appear in high numbers, positive experiences with the mimic may result in the model being treated as harmless. At higher frequency there is also a stronger selective advantage for the predator to distinguish mimic from model. For this reason, mimics are usually less numerous than models, an instance of frequency dependent selection. Some mimetic populations have evolved multiple forms (polymorphism), enabling them to mimic several different models and thereby to gain greater protection. Batesian mimicry is not always perfect. A variety of explanations have been proposed for this, including limitations in predators' cognition. While visual signals have attracted most study, Batesian mimicry can employ deception of any of the senses; some moths mimic the ultrasound warning signals sent by unpalatable moths to bat predators, constituting auditory Batesian mimicry.  Historical background  Henry Walter Bates described the form of mimicry that bears his name in 1861. Henry Walter Bates (1825‚Äì1892) was an English explorer-naturalist who surveyed the Amazon rainforest with Alfred Russel Wallace in 1848. While Wallace returned in 1852, Bates remained for over a decade. His field research included collecting almost a hundred species of butterflies from the families Ithomiinae and Heliconiinae, as well as thousands of other insects specimens. In sorting these butterflies into similar groups based on appearance, inconsistencies began to arise. Some appeared superficially similar to others, even so much so that Bates could not tell some species apart based only on wing appearance. However, closer examination of less obvious morphological characters seemed to show that they were not even closely related. Shortly after his return to England he read a paper on his theory of mimicry at a meeting of the Linnean Society of London on 21 November 1861, which was then published in 1862 as 'Contributions to an Insect Fauna of the Amazon Valley' in the society's Transactions.; Reprint: He elaborated on his experiences further in The Naturalist on the River Amazons. Bates put forward the hypothesis that the close resemblance between unrelated species was an antipredator adaptation. He noted that some species showed very striking coloration, and flew in a leisurely manner, almost as if taunting predators to eat them. He reasoned that these butterflies were unpalatable to birds and other insectivores, and were thus avoided by them. He extended this logic to forms that closely resembled such protected species, mimicking their warning coloration but not their toxicity. This naturalistic explanation fitted well with the recent account of evolution by Wallace and Charles Darwin, as outlined in his famous 1859 book The Origin of Species. Because this Darwinian explanation required no supernatural forces, it met with considerable criticism from anti-evolutionists, both in academic circles and in the broader social realm.  Aposematism  The yellow-banded poison dart frog (Dendrobates leucomelas) has conspicuous aposematic coloration. Most living things have predators and therefore are in a constant evolutionary arms race to develop antipredator adaptations, while the predator adapts to become more efficient at defeating the prey's adaptations. Some organisms have evolved to make detection less likely, for example by nocturnality and camouflage. Others have developed chemical defences such as the deadly toxins of certain snakes and wasps, or the noxious scent of the skunk. Such prey often send clear and honest warning signals to their attackers with conspicuous aposematic (warning) patterns. The brightness of such warning signs is correlated with the level of toxicity of the organism. In Batesian mimicry, the mimic effectively copies the coloration of an aposematic animal, known as the model, to deceive predators into behaving as if it were distasteful. The success of this dishonest display depends on the level of toxicity of the model and the abundance of the model in the geographical area. The more toxic the model is, the more likely it is that the predator will avoid the mimic. The abundance of the model species is also important for the success of the mimic because of frequency dependent selection. When the model is abundant, mimics with imperfect model patterns or slightly different coloration from the model are still avoided by predators. This is because the predator has a strong incentive to avoid potentially lethal organisms, given the likelihood of encountering one. However, in areas where the model is scarce or locally extinct, mimics are driven to accurate aposematic coloration. This is because predators attack imperfect mimics more readily where there is little chance that they are the model species. Frequency dependent selection may also have driven Batesian mimics to become polymorphic in rare cases where a single genetic switch controls appearance, as in the swallowtail butterflies (the Papilionidae) such as the pipevine swallowtail.  Classification and comparisons  Batesian mimicry is a case of protective or defensive mimicry, where the mimic does best by avoiding confrontations with the signal receiver. It is a disjunct system, which means that all three parties are from different species. An example would be the robber fly Mallophora bomboides, which is a Batesian mimic of its bumblebee model and prey, B. americanorum (now more commonly known as Bombus pensylvanicus), which is noxious to predators due to its sting. Batesian mimicry stands in contrast to other forms such as aggressive mimicry, where the mimic profits from interactions with the signal receiver. One such case of this is in fireflies, where females of one species mimic the mating signals of another species, deceiving males to come close enough for them to eat. Mimicry need not involve a predator at all though. Such is the case in dispersal mimicry, where the mimic once again benefits from the encounter. For instance, some fungi have their spores dispersed by insects by smelling like carrion. In protective mimicry, the meeting between mimic and dupe is not such a fortuitous occasion for the mimic, and the signals it mimics tend to lower the probability of such an encounter. A case somewhat similar to Batesian mimicry is that of mimetic weeds, which imitate agricultural crops. In weed or Vavilovian mimicry, the weed survives by having seeds which winnowing machinery identifies as belonging to the crop. Vavilovian mimicry is not Batesian, because man and crop are not enemies. By contrast, a leaf-mimicking plant, the chameleon vine, employs Batesian mimicry by adapting its leaf shape and colour to match that of its host to deter herbivores from eating its edible leaves. Another analogous case within a single species has been termed Browerian mimicry (after Lincoln P. Brower and Jane Van Zandt BrowerBrower, L. P. (1970) Plant poisons in a terrestrial food chain and implications for mimicry theory. In K. L. Chambers (ed) Biochemical Coevolution Corvallis, OR: Oregon State Univ. pp. 69-82.). This is a case of bipolar (only two species involved) automimicry; the model is the same species as its mimic. Equivalent to Batesian mimicry within a single species, it occurs when there is a palatability spectrum within a population of harmful prey. For example, monarch (Danaus plexippus) caterpillars feed on milkweed species of varying toxicity. Some feed on more toxic plants, and store these toxins within themselves. The more palatable caterpillars thus profit from the more toxic members of the same species. Another important form of protective mimicry is M√ºllerian mimicry, discovered by and named after the naturalist Fritz M√ºller. In M√ºllerian mimicry both model and mimic are aposematic, so mimicry may be mutual, does not necessarily constitute a bluff or deception, and as in the wasps and bees may involve many species in a mimicry ring.  Imperfect Batesian mimicry  The hoverfly Spilomyia longicornis is an imperfect Batesian mimic of wasps, lacking their long antennae and wasp waist. In imperfect Batesian mimicry, the mimics do not exactly resemble their models. An example of this is the fly Spilomyia longicornis, which mimics vespid wasps. However, it is not a perfect mimic. Wasps have long black antennae and this fly does not. Instead, they wave their front legs above their heads to look like the antennae on the wasps.Curran, C. H. (1951). Synopsis of the North American species of Spilomyia (Syrphidae, Diptera). American Museum Novitates. http://digitallibrary.amnh.org/bitstream/handle/2246/2364//v2/dspace/ingest/pdfSource/nov/N1492.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed;=y. Many reasons have been suggested for imperfect mimicry. Imperfect mimics may simply be evolving towards perfection. They may gain advantage from resembling multiple models at once. Humans may evaluate mimics differently from actual predators. Mimics may confuse predators by resembling both model and nonmimic at the same time (satiric mimicry). Kin selection may enforce poor mimicry. The selective advantage of better mimicry may not outweigh the advantages of other strategies like thermoregulation or camouflage. Only certain traits may be required to deceive predators; for example, tests on the sympatry/allopatry border (where the two are in the same area, and where they are not) of the mimic Lampropeltis elapsoides and the model Micrurus fulvius showed that color proportions in these snakes were important in deceiving predators, but that the order of the colored rings was not.  Acoustic mimicry  Tiger moths like Cycnia tenera are aposematic by sound, emitting ultrasonic warning signals. They are mimicked by pyralid moths, which are not foul-tasting but emit similar sounds. Predators may identify their prey by sound as well as sight; mimics have accordingly evolved to deceive the hearing of their predators. Bats are nocturnal predators that rely on echolocation to detect their prey. Some potential prey are unpalatable to bats, and produce an ultrasonic aposematic signal, the auditory equivalent of warning coloration. In response to echolocating red bats and big brown bats, tiger moths such as Cycnia tenera produce warning sounds. Bats learn to avoid the harmful moths, but similarly avoid other species such as some pyralid moths that produce such warning sounds as well. Acoustic mimicry complexes, both Batesian and M√ºllerian, may be widespread in the auditory world.

It lies immediately east of Sligachan. It is one of only two Corbetts on Skye. From many angles the hill resembles a perfect cone of scree, though it is linked to the rest of the Red Hills by way of a bealach, the Bealach na Sgairde (pronounced b'ya-loch na skaar-st'ya), meaning the pass of scree. In 1889, a Gurkha named Harkabir Tharpa scaled Glamaig in 37 minutes; his total time for the round trip, starting and finishing at sea level in the bar of the Sligachan Inn was 55 minutes. Legend has it that he ran it in bare feet, and his record stood until the 1980s, despite being attempted by Olympians such as Chris Brasher in the 1950s. From Sligachan one route of ascent (whether running or hillwalking) is simply to head up the scree aiming for the summit - this climb is very arduous, due to the unrelenting gradient and the slipperiness of the scree. Descent may be made by way of ascent; alternatively one may continue along the Red Cuillin ridge to take in other peaks to the south. A slightly less arduous (but longer) climb approaches the mountain from its eastern end at Sconser. Climb first to the secondary summit, An Coileach (The Cockerel), then follow the whaleback ridge to the primary summit, Sgurr Mhairi (Mary's Peak). Once An Coileach is reached at , the more-or-less level ridge allows some respite from the gradient, with a gentler ascent of the final to Sgurr Mhairi. From the summit there are excellent views of both the Black Cuillin and the Isle of Raasay. Glamaig Hill Race Glamaig has been the site of an annual hill race since the 1980s. It begins and finishes at the Sligachan Hotel.

As traditionally defined the genus was very species-rich, ranging through Europe, Asia and North America, but this arrangement was found to be paraphyletic to the certainly distinct prairie dogs, marmots, and antelope squirrels. As a consequence, all the former Spermophilus species of North America have been moved to other genera, leaving the European and Asian species as true Spermophilus (the only exceptions are two Asian Urocitellus). Some species are sometimes called susliks (or sousliks). This name comes from Russian —Å—É—Å–ª–∏–∫, suslik.The Free Dictionary In some languages, a derivative of the name is in common usage, for example suse≈Ç in Polish. The scientific name of this genus means \\"seed-lovers\\" (gr. œÉœÄŒ≠œÅŒºŒ± sperma, genitive œÉœÄŒ≠œÅŒºŒ±œÑŒøœÇ spermatos ‚Äì seed; œÜŒØŒªŒøœÇ philos ‚Äì friend, lover). Habitat and behavior As typical ground squirrels, Spermophilus live in open habitats like grasslands, meadows, steppe and semideserts, feed on the low plants, and use burrows as nests and refuge. They are diurnal and mostly live in colonies, although some species also can occur singly. They are found in both lowlands to highlands, hibernate during the colder months (up to 8 months each year in some species) and in arid regions they may also aestivate during the summer or fall. The distributions of the various species are mostly separated, often by large rivers, although there are regions inhabited by as many as three species and rarely two species may even form mixed colonies. A few species are known to hybridize where their ranges come into contact. Appearance Spermophilus are overall yellowish, light orangish, light brownish or greyish. Although many are inconspicuously mottled or spotted, or have orange markings on the head, overall they lack strong patterns, except in S. suslicus, which commonly has brown upperparts with clear white spotting. Size varies with species and they have a head-and-body length of . Before hibernation the largest S. fulvus may weigh up to and the largest S. major up to almost , but they always weigh much less earlier in the year and other species are considerably smaller, mostly less than even in peak condition before hibernation. All have a fairly short tail that‚Äîdepending on exact species‚Äîis around 10‚Äì45% of the length of the head-and-body. Relationship with humans Ground squirrels may carry fleas that transmit diseases to humans (see Black Death), and have been destructive in tunneling underneath human habitation.Encyclop√¶dia Britannica  Species  Spermophilus suslicus, a species that commonly has clearly white-spotted upperparts A generic revision was undertaken in 2007 by means of phylogenetic analyses using the mitochondrial gene cytochrome b. This resulted in the splitting of Spermophilus into eight genera, which with the prairie dogs, marmots, and antelope squirrels are each given as numbered clades. The exact relations between the clades are slightly unclear. Among these, these exclusively Palearctic species are retained as the genus Spermophilus sensu stricto (in the strictest sense). * Spermophilus sensu stricto, Old World ground squirrels :* Alashan ground squirrel, Spermophilus alashanicus :* Brandt's ground squirrel, Spermophilus brevicauda :* European ground squirrel, Spermophilus citellus :* Daurian ground squirrel, Spermophilus dauricus :* Red-cheeked ground squirrel, Spermophilus erythrogenys :* Yellow ground squirrel, Spermophilus fulvus :* Russet ground squirrel, Spermophilus major :* Caucasian Mountain ground squirrel, Spermophilus musicus :* Spermophilus nilkaensis :* Spermophilus pallidicauda :* Little ground squirrel, Spermophilus pygmaeus :* Spermophilus ralli :* Spermophilus relictus :* Speckled ground squirrel, Spermophilus suslicus :* Taurus ground squirrel, Spermophilus taurensis :* Asia Minor ground squirrel, Spermophilus xanthoprymnus =Prehistoric species= Discovery and examination of one of the best preserved Eurasian ground squirrel fossils yet recovered allowed the study of many previously unknown aspects of ground squirrel cranial anatomy, and prompted a critical reassessment of their phylogenetic position.

Born about 1645, it is likely that Exquemelin was a native of Honfleur, France, who on his return from buccaneering settled in Holland, possibly because he was a Huguenot. In 1666 he was engaged by the French West India Company and went to Tortuga, where he worked as an indentured servant for three years. There he enlisted with the buccaneers, in particular with the band of Henry Morgan, whose confidante he was, probably as a barber-surgeon, and remained with them until 1674. Shortly afterwards he returned to Europe and settled in Amsterdam where he qualified professionally as a surgeon, his name appearing on the 1679 register of the Dutch Surgeons' Guild. However, he was later once again in the Caribbean as his name appears on the muster-roll as a surgeon in the attack on Cartagena in 1697.Jack Beeching, \\"Introduction\\" in A. O. Exquemelin, The Buccaneers of America, London: Folio Society, 1972. The bibliographic legacy of Exquemelin's History of the Buccaneers of America is complex. It was first published in Dutch (1678), then translated into German (1679), Spanish (1681) and English (1684).Richard Frohock, Buccaneers and Privateers: The Story of the English Sea Rover, 1675‚Äì1725, University of Delaware Press, 2012, 28. The German translation is a faithful translation of the original Dutch. The Spanish translation adds new material quite freely and without acknowledgment, and mistranslates the Dutch frequently, while the English translation appears to be as much a translation of the Spanish edition, including most of its deviations from the Dutch original. The French translation of 1686 is substantially a new work with many additions, including new pirate biographies (Daniel Montbars and Alexandre Bras-de-Fer) and complete rearrangements in some sections incorporating new material of unknown source. Subsequent editions and translations added additional new material and whole biographies. Following publication of the English translation in 1684, Henry Morgan took steps to discredit the book and successfully brought a libel suit against the book's publishers William Crooke and Thomas Malthus. Morgan particularly objected to the description of the capture of the third castle at Portobello in 1668 where the book said he had ordered the construction of ladders wide enough for three men to climb abreast; when they were completed he \\"commanded all the religious men and women whom he had taken prisoners to fix them against the walls of the castle ... these were forced, at the head of the companies to raise and apply them to the walls ... Thus many of the religious men and nuns were killed\\". In Morgan's affidavit he stated that he had \\"against evil deeds, piracies and robberies the greatest abhorrence and distrust\\", and that \\"for the kind of men called buccaneers\\", he \\"always had and still has hatred\\". The court found in his favour and the book was retracted; damages of ¬£200 were paid to him. The passage about the use of nuns and monks as a human shield was retracted from subsequent publications in England.

Like a number of other ground squirrels, they are sometimes called prairie dogs or gophers, though the latter name belongs more strictly to the pocket gophers of family Geomyidae, and the former to members of the genus Cynomys. Taxonomy Fossil specimen This squirrel was named after the Scottish naturalist Sir John Richardson. North Dakota is nicknamed the Flickertail state after the squirrel . The nickname Dakrat is derived from \\"Dakota Rat\\" and is a commonly used name around Minot, North Dakota and on Minot Air Force Base. . Habitat Native to the short grass prairies, Richardson's ground squirrel is found mainly in the northern states of the United States, such as North Dakota and Montana, and in western Canada, including central and southern Alberta and southern Saskatchewan.Animal Diversity Webhttp://fieldguide.mt.gov/speciesDetail.aspx?elcode=AMAFB05040 The range of this animal expanded as forests were cleared to create farmland. They are not simply restricted to prairie; sometimes they adapt to suburban environments, causing them to be seen as pests because of the burrows they dig. It is not unusual to find squirrels digging tunnels under the sidewalks and patios of urban homes. Description Typical adults are about long. Weights vary greatly with time of year and with location: at emergence from hibernation the squirrels weigh between for females and between for males. But by the time they hibernate again, their weight may have risen to nearly . Males are slightly larger and heavier than females on average. They are dark brown on the upper side and tan underneath. The tail is shorter and less bushy than in other ground squirrels, and the external ears are so short as to look more like holes in the animal's head. Behavior is more like that of a prairie dog than a typical ground squirrel. The tail is constantly trembling, so the animal is sometimes called the \\"flickertail\\". Males have an average life expectancy of 3 years, while females average 4 years. However, in captivity some individuals may live for 5 to 7 years. Behavior Exhibiting territorial behavior Richardson's ground squirrels appear to live communally, but they organize their social structure around female kinship. A female Richardson's ground squirrel will tolerate the presence of closely related females, but are territorial towards other individuals. Individuals are territorial around their nest sites. The burrows of Richardson's ground squirrels are grouped closely together in colonies, and individuals give audible alarm calls when possible predators approach. Recent research has shown that in some cases, ultrasonic alarm calls are given, and are responded to by other members of the colony. Richardson's ground squirrels use two audible alarm calls, a high-pitched whistle and a 'chirp' call. The whistle is given in response to terrestrial predators, while the chirp is given in response to aerial predators such as hawks. Predators include hawks, owls, snakes, weasels, badgers and coyotes. Eating a dandelion =Feeding= These animals are omnivores, eating seeds, nuts, grains, grasses and insects. In addition they have cannibalistic tendencies, where they will consume the corpses of other ground squirrels after dragging them down their burrows or indeed on the surface. =Hibernation= Adult ground squirrels may hibernate as early as July, though in their first year, the young ground squirrels do not hibernate until September. The males emerge from hibernation in March, and establish territories before the females emerge a couple of weeks later. Abandoned burrows are sometimes taken over by other grassland species such as the burrowing owl. =Reproduction= Female Richardson's ground squirrels produce one litter per year. Litter size averages 6, though the maximum size recorded is 14. The young are born in April or May. Young ground squirrels remain underground in the burrow until they are approximately 30 days old, emerging from natal burrows late May to mid-June. At emergence, the young weigh 50 to 100 grams. Relationship with humans In a suburban environment Because they will readily eat crop species, Richardson's ground squirrels are sometimes considered to be agricultural pests, although this is not their legal status in all jurisdictions. The government of Saskatchewan declared the animals pests in 2010, allowing local governments to employ gopher control measures.In areas with few natural predators, overpopulation and increasing density can drive ground squirrels to expand into suburban neighborhoods. =Control measures= Farmers and ranchers have developed a variety of ways to exterminate ground squirrels besides trapping, shooting and poisoning. One such process fills the burrows with a mixture of oxygen and propane and then ignites the gas mixture. This kills the ground squirrels with a concussive force that also collapses the tunnel systems. While both solutions are effective, ground squirrels from outside of the treated areas will eventually spread back into the area. The Saskatoon Wildlife Federation sponsored a 12-week \\"gopher derby\\" in 2002, in an effort to reduce what it considered an overpopulation of the squirrels. Cash prizes were awarded for the most number of animals killed, with the animals' tails being presented as proof of the kill. The Canadian Humane Society called the contest cruel and barbaric. Despite the criticism, the derby was repeated in 2003. By 2004, the ground squirrel population had dropped and the contest was cancelled. The Gopher Hole Museum in Torrington, Alberta, Canada, has a large selection of stuffed ground squirrels of many varieties and colors. =Pet trade= The Richardson's ground squirrel in recent years has become popular in the exotic pet trade.

It first appeared in Halo: Combat Evolved, and was remade for Halo 2 as \\"Coagulation\\", as well as for Halo: Reach as \\"Hemorrhage\\" and Halo: The Master Chief Collection as \\"Bloodline\\". It also had spiritual successors in Halo 3's \\"Valhalla\\", in Halo 4 and Halo Wars as \\"Ragnarok\\", and in Halo 5's \\"Basin\\". Taking place in a canyon on the Halo ringworld that resembles the American Southwest, it was designed for the Capture the flag game mode but can also be used for other modes, such as deathmatch. Blood Gulch was one of Halo's most critically acclaimed and influential multiplayer maps, and played a significant role in the machinima series Red vs. Blue.  Level content  Blood Gulch takes place in a box canyon on a Halo ring that is enclosed on all sides by high natural walls. The canyon's interior is a \\"vast expanse of undulating landscape and scattered pieces of natural cover\\", with a base on each end for the Red and Blue teams. The map is balanced but lopsided in terms of tactical advantage, with the Red team having access to a ridge, while the Blue team is located near a tunnel system in the canyon wall. Each base is conducive to traditional FPS gameplay, with \\"two entrances, an open ceiling, and sloping paths to the roof\\". On top of each base, a teleporter can transport players (from either team) to the midst of the valley's no man's land, leaving them vulnerable to snipers. Warthog jeeps can easily traverse the landscape, making them ideal for escaping with the flag. In the Halo 2 variant of the map, each base has a third, below ground level, in which a Banshee can be found. When playing the gamemode ‚ÄúRocket Slayer‚Äù, the Warthogs are replaced with Scorpion tanks.  Development  Jaime Griesemer, the designer of Halo: Combat Evolved, stated that the design of Blood Gulch was responsible for the Scorpion tank remaining in the game, saying that the developers wanted to remove it, as it was not used in the game's campaign mode enough, but found it fun enough to drive around Blood Gulch that it was left in the game. He also stated that the game's sniper rifle was given a scope due to the distance between Blood Gulch's two bases.  Reception  Wes Fenlon from PC Gamer opined that \\"if there's anything truly and utterly timeless about Halo, it's that voice playing over the warm blue sky and dusty fields of Blood Gulch\\". IGN's Ryan Mccaffrey consider Coagulation, the Halo 2 iteration of Blood Gulch, to be the Halo series' arguably most famous map, \\"the boxed desert canyon that's been home to countless CTF matches and Red vs. Blue episodes\\". Edge called the map a \\"showcase\\" for Halo's \\"wonderful ability to segue in and out of tense firefights and moments of ridiculous slapstick\\". The publication praised the map for its wide open design and combination of ground combat and third-person vehicles, which, while taken for granted in the modern day, was rare at the time of Halo's release and required \\"a different approach to map design\\". In Engadget's coverage of the reveal of the Blood Gulch map returning for Halo: Reach, Richard Mitchell remarked that it is \\"probably the most well-remembered map in Halo history\\", while the version in Reach is \\"very familiar and very different\\", drawing attention to the fact that players can leave the canyon. Good Game called the map \\"Halo's most iconic\\" and said that \\"teamwork is at the core of the Gulch\\", while \\"the best way to experience the gulch has always been behind the wheel\\". GameZone called the map \\"easily a standout of the franchise\\", citing how often it has been remade across games. Ryan McCaffrey of Official Xbox Magazine called Blood Gulch \\"one of the best multiplayer maps to grace any first-person shooter\\" and praised the map's successor, Hemmorage, that carries over the map's terrain. Phil Spencer, head of the Xbox brand, called Blood Gulch his favorite Halo map, citing its terrain, large amount of vehicle combat and the excitement of coordinating friends to capture the flag. Blood Gulch was recreated by a fan for the game Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, with Kotaku calling the map \\"very nicely done\\".

A Whig, Jones twice defeated rising politician James K. Polk for the governorship (in 1841 and 1843). He was the first native-born Tennessean to be elected governor. Jones's first gubernatorial term was marked by gridlock with the state senate, which was led by a group of Democratic senators known as the \\"Immortal Thirteen.\\" His second term was more productive, as his fellow Whigs controlled both houses of the legislature. Though he later joined the Democratic Party, Jones's speaking skills and campaign style helped to solidify Tennessee's Whigs as one of the strongest Whig movements in the South. Early life A thin man whose nickname was \\"Lean Jimmy\\" (he stood 6'2\\" but weighed only 125 pounds), Jones was born in Davidson County, Tennessee, the son of Peter and Catherine Chappell Jones. His parents died when he was still young, and he was raised by an uncle in Wilson County. He occasionally attended public schools. After marrying Sarah Munford in 1829, he purchased a farm near Lebanon, Tennessee. In 1836, Jones supported the presidential campaign of Hugh Lawson White, a former Democrat who had turned against Andrew Jackson and joined the Whig Party. The following year, Jones was elected to the Tennessee House of Representatives, representing Wilson County. He was reelected in 1839. In 1840, Jones was an elector for presidential candidate William Henry Harrison.Phillip Langsdon, Tennessee: A Political History (Franklin, Tenn.: Hillsboro Press, 2000), pp. 99-103, 127-129. While in the legislature, Jones studied law, but never practiced. Governor In 1841, the Tennessee Whigs nominated Jones as their candidate for governor. The Whigs believed that Jones, widely known as an entertaining speaker and storyteller, was their best shot to defeat incumbent governor, James K. Polk. After besting Polk in a series of debates in the Spring of 1841, Jones won the election by just 3,000 votes out of over 100,000 cast. William G. Brownlow's A Political Register praising Jones' victory in the 1843 election Following the election of 1841, Whigs controlled the state House of Representatives, but Democrats held onto the state senate by a 13 to 12 margin. One of the first tasks of the new government was to fill the U.S. Senate seats left vacant by the resignations of Alexander O. Anderson and Alfred O. P. Nicholson. Democrats demanded one of the two seats go to a Democrat, a request the Whigs rejected. The 13 Democrats in the state senate, who became known as the \\"Immortal Thirteen,\\" refused to allow a joint session of the legislature (where Whigs, who controlled the House, would have a numerical majority) to choose the replacement senators, and Tennessee thus had no representation in the U.S. Senate for most of 1842 and 1843. Though the government was mostly gridlocked by the Immortal Thirteen during Jones's first term, it did manage to enact debt reform legislation in 1842. In the election of 1843, Polk canvassed the state extensively in hopes of taking back the governor's office, but he was again unsuccessful. Furthermore, Whigs gained control of the state senate, ending the \\"Immortal Thirteen\\" gridlock, and two Whigs were appointed to the state's U.S. Senate seats. Jones's second term saw the establishment of a state school for the blind in Nashville and a school for the deaf in Knoxville. In 1843, Nashville, which had been serving as the temporary capital of the state for years (as had several other places before it), was officially selected as the state's permanent capital. The cornerstone for the Tennessee State Capitol was laid while Jones was still governor. U.S. Senate and later life Jones did not seek a third term, choosing instead to accept an offer to become president of the Memphis and Charleston Railroad. He was an elector for Zachary Taylor in the U.S. presidential election of 1848. In 1851, the state legislature chose Jones to replace Hopkins L. Turney in the U.S. Senate. Jones supported Winfield Scott in the presidential election of 1852, but afterward began to drift apart from the Whig Party, which was imploding over the issue of slavery. In 1854, he railed against northern Whigs for refusing to support the Kansas-Nebraska Act. After the collapse of the Whig Party, Jones refused to join the American Party with other southern Whigs, and supported James Buchanan in the 1856 presidential election. He endorsed Stephen Douglas in the election of 1860. After serving in the United States Senate, Jones retired to his farm near Memphis, where he died. He was interred in the city's Elmwood Cemetery.

Gleb Kotelnikov with his invention, the knapsack parachute. Professional career  In 1911, he created his first parachute RK-1 (which stands for Rantseviy (knapsack) or Russian Kotelnikova (by Kotelnikov), 1st model), that was successfully employed in 1914 during World War I. Later on, Kotelnikov significantly improved the design of his parachute, creating new models, including RK-2 with a softer knapsack, RK-3, and a few cargo parachutes, all of which would be adopted by the Soviet Air Force. Having witnessed the death of a talented Russian pilot Lev Matsivich and been shocked by it, he became obsessed with the idea of constructing a parachute, to which he devoted several years of his life as well as all his personal savings. In 1911 he applied for a patent to the Committee on Inventions in France and was granted the patent under the number 438612, in which he summarized the function of his parachute: > The working principle of the apparatus is as follows: in case of an > emergency, a pilot, wearing it on his back, could throw himself out of an > aircraft, opening a knapsack by pulling a cord attached to its lock. In case > of an unexpected fall the device can work quite automatically. For that > purpose the lock of the parapack is connected with a carriage of an aircraft > by means of a cord which would open the lock of a parapack being stretched > under the weight of a falling man. At first G.Kotelnikov called his invention a safety apparatus, a knapsack- parachute and later on it got the name of RK-1. In 1912, on a road near Tsarskoye Selo (now part of St. Petersburg) Kotelnikov successfully demonstrated the braking effects of the parachute by accelerating a Russo-Balt automobile to the top speed, and then opening a parachute attached to the back seat, thus inventing the drogue parachute.Parachuting at the site Divo: The Russian Book of records and achievements In aviation, however, drag chutes were used for the first time only in 1937 by the Soviet airplanes in the Arctic that were providing support for the famous polar expeditions of the era, such as the first drifting ice station North Pole-1, launched the same year. The drag chute allowed to land safely on the ice-floes of smaller size. Tomb of Kotelnikov at the Novodevichy Cemetery in Moscow. Monument to the RK-1 test in Kotelnikovo.

In his late years, Kotelnikov wrote a book about the invention and subsequent development of parachutes. Kotelnikov died November 22, 1944, during World War II. The village Saalisi, where he first tested his parachute was renamed Kotelnikovo in his honor. His grave at Novodevichy Cemetery in Moscow became a place of pilgrimage for Russian paratroopers.

Gameplay  The gameplay in Pac-Man Plus is nearly identical to that of the original Pac- Man. The player controls Pac-Man and attempts to score as many points as possible by eating all the Pac-Dots in the maze while avoiding the four ghosts that chase him around the maze and will kill him if they catch him. Eating a Power Pellet will cause the ghosts to turn blue and become vulnerable for a short period of time, allowing Pac-Man to eat them for extra points. Once the maze has been cleared, it will be refilled as the gameplay continues. The most noticeable differences between the original game and Plus are various tweaks to the graphics: the maze is green instead of blue, vulnerable ghosts are shorter and have a stem and leaf sticking out of their heads, the fruits have been replaced by new items (including a can of Coca-Cola) and the ghosts' eyes are now a pixel closer to each other. In addition to these cosmetic changes, Plus also changes the gameplay slightly: eating a bonus item will cause the ghosts to turn both vulnerable and invisible, and doubles their point value while they are vulnerable. Eating a Power Pellet also sometimes has unpredictable results, such as turning the maze invisible or turning only three of the four ghosts blue (the latter of which makes it impossible to clear a round by using a pattern). The ghosts are also faster and more aggressive than they were in the original Pac-Man, which makes the game seem overall faster-paced and more difficult by comparison.  Development  Midway advertised the game as \\"the only legal PAC-MAN conversion package\\"Quoted from the official flyer and called it \\"Exciting!\\" and \\"New!\\".Emdkay.net Pac-Man Plus was an upgrade kit for Namco Pac-Man boards. It consisted of a module which connected via a ribbon cable to the socket originally occupied by the Z-80 microprocessor. The module contained its own Z-80 microprocessor as well as additional components. It was potted with epoxy to prevent easy reverse-engineering. Additionally, the kit also replaced the 4 Pac-Man program roms on the main game board with a new code. Two other roms containing updated data for drawing character and maze were also exchanged. Finally, two relatively tiny supplementary roms containing new color data completed the modification.  Legacy  There were no contemporary home versions.

It is based on Pac-Man and its derivatives but, like Baby Pac-Man, and Pac-Man Plus, was created without the authorization of Namco. This was one of several games that eventually led to the termination of the licensing agreement between Namco and Bally Midway in 1984. Unlike prior games in the series, the maze in Jr. Pac-Man scrolls horizontally and has no escape tunnels. Gameplay Title screen The gameplay of Jr. Pac-Man is very similar to that of its predecessors: The player controls the eponymous Jr. Pac-Man (who wears an animated propeller beanie), and scores points by eating all of the dots in the maze, while four ghosts chase him around the maze and attempt to kill him. The player can eat an energizer to turn the ghosts blue, making them vulnerable for a short period of time, and allowing the player to eat them for extra points. Once the maze is cleared, a new maze is presented and the gameplay continues. The mazes are now two times the width of the monitor and scroll horizontally. A total of seven mazes appear throughout the game, and five of them have six energizers instead of four, but none of them have tunnels that wrap around from one side of the screen to the other. As in the previous games, bonus items (such as tricycles, kites, and balloons) appear in each round, starting above the ghosts' lair and moving around the maze as in Ms. Pac-Man. As an item encounters dots, it changes them into larger dots that are worth 50 points instead of 10, but they also slow Jr. Pac-Man down more than regular dots as he eats them. If an item has been out for long enough and then encounters an energizer, it will self-destruct, taking the energizer with it. If Jr. Pac-Man should die, all larger dots will disappear from the maze, except if there are only a few left, which revert to their original smaller size. The game's intermissions center around the developing relationship between Jr. Pac-Man and a small red (female) ghost named Yum-Yum (who is apparently the daughter of Blinky).

He is remembered best as the first actor to play the television science-fiction character Professor Bernard Quatermass, in the 1953 BBC Television serial The Quatermass Experiment. Early life Reginald Tate was born in Garforth, near Leeds in the West Riding of Yorkshire, and went to school in York. During the First World War he served with the Northamptonshire Regiment and later with the Royal Flying Corps.Pixley, p. 6. He left the armed forces after the end of the war and studied acting at Leeds College of Music and Drama. He made his first professional acting appearance at Leeds Art Theatre in 1922, and for the next four years was a resident performer both there and at the city's Little Theatre. In 1926, he moved to London, with his first major role being in a production of Romeo and Juliet at the Strand Theatre. He had particular success with the lead role of Stanhope in R. C. Sherriff's play Journey's End, playing the part in a 1929 tour of Australia and New Zealand and again for a 1934 revival production at the Criterion Theatre in London. Film and television career He made his film debut in 1934 in Whispering Tongues, and later in the decade also began to appear in the newer medium of television. On 11 November 1937, Tate appeared as Stanhope again in a production of Journey's End made by the BBC's fledgling television service, one of its earliest major drama productions.Vahimagi, p. 8. His performance was praised by the television critic of The Times newspaper, who wrote that: \\"his performance [was] brilliantly full of fiery disillusionment. It successfully dominated the stage--no easy matter when Osborne is played as well as Mr. Basil Gill played him.\\" At the beginning of the Second World War he joined the Royal Air Force Volunteer Reserve. He was given the rank of pilot officer, and by the time his service came to an end in 1944 he had been promoted to squadron leader. He also continued to act during the war, and performed small roles in the well- known films The Life and Death of Colonel Blimp (1943) and The Way Ahead (1944). He also had a top supporting role as the intelligence officer, Major Richards, in another classic British war movie, The Next of Kin (1942). After the end of the war he continued to perform for theatre and increasingly for television. He met the Austrian television director Rudolph Cartier when Cartier cast him in his BBC production of It Is Midnight, Dr Schweitzer in February 1953. Cartier was impressed with Tate's performance, and later that year offered him the lead role in The Quatermass Experiment, a science-fiction serial he was directing, written by BBC staff scriptwriter Nigel Kneale. Tate was the second choice for the part of Professor Bernard Quatermass; Cartier had previously offered it to his co-star It Is Midnight, Dr Schweitzer, Andr√© Morell, who declined the role.Murray, p. 28. Morell would later play Quatermass for the third instalment of the series, Quatermass and the Pit. Tate however was a success in the part, and in a 1986 interview Nigel Kneale named him as his favourite of all the actors to have played the character. The serial itself was also a success, with the British Film Institute later describing it as \\"one of the most influential series of the 1950s.\\" Tate took an increased interest in television, and later in 1953 enrolled on the BBC's staff training course to become a television producer.Pixley, p. 15. He also began to spend much of his spare time teaching acting classes at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art (RADA), feeling that he had experience which might be useful to younger actors. Death When the BBC commissioned a second Quatermass serial in 1955, Tate was eager to participate and play the Professor again.Murray, p. 50. Production was due to begin in September, and on 7 August 1955 he produced his first television play, Night Was Our Friend.Pixley, p. 17. Only sixteen days after this, late at night on 23 August, he collapsed outside his home in London. He had suffered a heart attack, and despite being rushed to hospital in Putney he died soon afterwards.

In North America, it was distributed by Midway Games. Controlling Pac- Man, the player must make it to the end of each stage to return a lost fairy back to its home in Fairyland. Pac-Man will need to avoid obstacles, such as falling logs and water-spewing fire hydrants, alongside his enemies the Ghost Gang. Eating large flashing Power Pellets will cause the ghost to turn blue, allowing Pac-Man to eat them for points. It was the first game to run on the Namco Pac-Land hardware. Pac-Land was created by Namco Research and Development 1 programmer Yoshihiro Kishimoto, who was tasked with creating an arcade game based on the American Pac-Man cartoon series by Hanna-Barbera. The backgrounds were made to be vibrant and colorful, and the characters to be detailed and move smoothly to match the show's animation style. The control scheme was inspired by Konami's Track & Field, using buttons instead of a traditional joystick to make it stand out among other games at the time. A new arcade system was created to make it easier to develop the game and was used for several later Namco games, including Baraduke and Metro-Cross. Pac-Land was well-received by critics for its colorful graphics, stage designs, and soundtrack, although was often criticized for its difficulty. It is cited as an important and influential game in the platform genre, paving the way for many games to follow such as Alex Kidd, Ghosts'n Goblins, Wonder Boy, and Super Mario Bros.. It was ported to several home consoles and computers, including the Family Computer, TurboGrafx-16, Commodore 64 and Atari Lynx. It is the first platform game in the Pac-Man series, and was followed by Pac-Man 2: The New Adventures (1993). Gameplay Arcade version screenshot, taken from the American Midway release. Controlling Pac-Man, the player is tasked with reaching the end of each level while avoiding enemies and other obstacles. Stages are known in-game as \\"trips\\" and are broken into four sections ‚Äî the first three have Pac-Man running to return a lost fairy back to \\"Fairyland\\", and the last having Pac-Man return home to his family. Pressing either of the directional buttons will make Pac-Man walk in that direction, and repeatedly tapping either button will make him run. Pac-Man can also jump over pits and obstacles by pressing the jump button. In each stage, Pac-Man will encounter the four ghosts from the original game ‚Äî Blinky, Pinky, Inky, and Clyde ‚Äî alongside a purple ghost named Sue, originally a replacement for Clyde in Ms. Pac-Man. Eating large flashing Power Pellets will cause the ghosts to turn blue for a short time, allowing Pac-Man to eat them for bonus points. The ghosts are often seen driving vehicles, such as airplanes, buses, cars, pogo-sticks, and flying saucers, and will sometimes drop miniature ghost enemies from the air to try and hit Pac-Man. Other types of obstacles are also present in stages, such as water-spewing fire hydrants, springboards, falling logs, quicksand, and geysers. Trips consist of cities, forests, deserts, and abandoned castles. Most trip sections end with a large sign saying \\"BREAK TIME\\" with a church on a hill in the background, and bonus points are awarded for jumping at certain points at the end of each section. The final section of a trip gives Pac-Man a special pair of boots that will allow him to jump infinitely into the air, and tasks the player with returning home to Pac-Man's family. The player can find hidden items by pushing against specific objects in certain stages, including a helmet that protects Pac-Man from falling mini ghosts, an item that makes Pac-Man temporarily invincible, and a Galaxian flagship that awards the player a large sum of points. Jumping in certain spots will reveal fruit items that can be consumed for points. The game features the theme song from the Pac-Man cartoon series, which plays in a constant loop throughout. The North American version of the game by Midway features the characters being re-designed to more closely resemble the designs found in the show, while the Japanese Namco version has the characters modeled after Pac-Man marketing material and cabinet artwork. Development Pac-Land was programmed by Yoshihiro Kishimoto of Namco Development Division 1, who would later work on the Family Stadium franchise. After seeing the success of the American Pac-Man cartoon series by Hanna-Barbera, Namco requested Kishimoto that he create an arcade game based on the show. Kishimoto stated that the hardest part of development were Pac-Man's animations. Most arcade games in Japan at the time simply used two or three frames to convey movement, which he found unconvincing. The team wanted the game's backgrounds to be vibrant and colorful, and to have the characters move smoothly to replicate the show's animation style. Pac-Man himself was given 24 different frame patterns, alongside several facial expressions and clothing swaps. The game's controls were heavily influenced by Konami's Track & Field (1983), a game that allowed the player to become faster by constantly tapping the button in succession; Kishimoto thought the idea was interesting and that it would make it stand out among other games. To allow for two-layer scrolling backgrounds, more sprites, and more colors, the team created the Namco Pac-Land arcade board, which was used for several later Namco games including Baraduke (1985) and Metro-Cross (1985). The game was tested in Yokohama, where Kishimoto recalls the springboards being difficult for new players. Pac-Land was originally released in Japan in October 1984, and later published in North America by Midway Games. =Conversions= The first home port of Pac-Land was for the Nintendo Family Computer, released in Japan on November 21, 1985. Versions for the Amstrad CPC, ZX Spectrum, MSX, and Atari ST were published by British company Grandslam Entertainment in 1988, followed by a Commodore 64 release by Gannon Designs. Namco released a PC-Engine version in June 1989, which was later released for the TurboGrafx-16 by NEC in January 1990. Atari Games developed and published an Atari Lynx portable version in 1992, and Dempa Softworks released a Sharp X68000 conversion in 1994. Pac-Land is in the 1996 compilation Namco Museum Vol. 4 for the PlayStation alongside five other Namco arcade games from the 1980s, and later in the iOS game Namco Arcade. In 2014, it was ported to the Xbox 360, PlayStation 3, and PC as part of Pac-Man Museum, and the Famicom version was digitally re-released for the Wii U Virtual Console and Namco Museum Archives Volume 2. Aside from the Namco Arcade version, all home ports of the game are based on the Japanese Namco version. Reception and legacy Pac-Land was well received by critics for its colorful graphics, level structure, and challenge. It is considered an important and influential game in the platform genre, paving the way for games such as Ghosts'n Goblins, Alex Kidd, and Wonder Boy. Pac-Man creator Toru Iwatani has since labeled it as his favorite Pac-Man sequel for its interesting concept and gameplay. He said Shigeru Miyamoto told him it had a profound influence on the creation of Super Mario Bros. Reviewing the Atari Lynx conversion, IGN praised the game's colorful graphics, controls, and faithfulness to the arcade original. Raze magazine echoed a similar response, saying the visuals, stage layouts, and soundtrack added replay value to the game. Computer + Video Games called the TurboGrafx-16 version a \\"marvelous conversion\\" for its vibrant visuals, stage layouts, gameplay, and accuracy to the coin-op game; they had a similar response for the Lynx version, claiming its accuracy to the original would entice fans of the arcade release. Japanese publication Famitsu praised the PC-Engine version's graphics and overall challenge, awarding it the \\"Silver Hall of Fame\\" badge. Raze disliked the Lynx port's limited amount of lives and lack of continues, saying that the high difficulty would repel younger players. IGN stated it provided little replay value for veteran players, adding that it could be easily finished. AllGame was particularly critical of the TurboGrafx-16 version, lambasting its poor graphics, bland stage layouts, and lack of challenge, jokingly saying it was only recommended to collectors interested in \\"the most morbidly poor games in existence\\". In a retrospective review for the TurboGrafx-16 conversion, IGN disliked the game's difficulty for lacking any real challenge, and said the game seems to have been made simply to keep Pac-Man relevant at the time instead of as a \\"real deal\\" game. Shortly after the game's release, Namco produced a board game adaptation for its Fantasy Board Game series, based on the player reaching the end of the board without losing the \\"fairy chip\\". A Japanese LCD handheld game was released in 1990. Many of Pac-Man's moves in the Super Smash Bros. series are directly based on Pac-Land, such as his fire hydrant attack. Super Smash Bros. for Wii U and Super Smash Bros. Ultimate include a stage based on the game, featuring automatic scrolling.

The film was awarded the FIPRESCI Prize at the 1998 Cannes Film Festival for \\"its bold tracking of controversial contemporary themes, richly-layered subtext, and remarkable fluidity of visual style,\\" and the cast received the National Board of Review award for best ensemble performance.\\"Happiness ‚Äì Awards\\". IMDb. Amazon.com. Retrieved February 6, 2014. The film spawned the pseudo-sequel Life During Wartime which premiered at the 2009 Venice Film Festival. Plot Trish Maplewood (Cynthia Stevenson), the eldest Jordan sister, is an upper middle class housewife married to psychiatrist Bill Maplewood (Dylan Baker) and has three children. She appears to have the perfect marriage, but she is unaware of Bill's secret life: he is a pedophile who is obsessed with 11-year-old Johnny Grasso, a classmate of their son, Billy (Rufus Read). When Johnny comes to the Jordan house for a sleepover, Bill drugs and rapes him. Later, Bill learns that another boy, Ronald Farber, is home alone while his parents are away in Europe. Under the guise of attending a PTA meeting, Bill drives to the boy's house and rapes him as well. After Johnny is taken to the hospital and found to have been sexually abused, the police arrive at the Maplewood residence to question Bill. After alerting his wife to the police presence, Bill begins by asking the two detectives, \\"You said something about Ronald Farber?\\" The two detectives, looking puzzled, say nothing. Bill then stammers, \\"I mean, Johnny Grasso.\\" Out on bail, he tearfully admits to Billy that he \\"fucked\\" the boys, that he enjoyed it, and that he would do it again. When Billy asks, \\"Would you ever fuck me?\\", his father replies, \\"No... I'd jerk off instead.\\" Helen Jordan (Lara Flynn Boyle), the middle sister, is a successful author who is adored and envied by everyone she knows, and can have any man she wants. Her charmed life leaves her ultimately unfulfilled, however. She despairs that no one wants her for herself, and that the praise regularly heaped upon her is undeserved. She is fascinated by an unknown man who makes obscene phone calls to her apartment and tries to seek out a relationship with him. But she is disappointed when she finds out the man is her neighbor Allen (Philip Seymour Hoffman), to whom she is not attracted. Allen‚Äîwho is coincidentally one of Bill's patients‚Äîsinks into depression as Helen's rejection ruins his fantasies, and he realizes that a woman who truly cares for him, Kristina (Camryn Manheim), has been right under his nose all along. However, she had recently killed the apartment doorman after he raped her. While Allen is still content with her friendship after she confided this in him, it is revealed by Helen the genitals of the doorman were discovered by police less than six months later in Kristina's freezer. Joy (Jane Adams), the youngest sister, is overly sensitive and lacking direction. She works in telephone sales, but leaves to do something more fulfilling: teaching at an immigrant-education center. Her students call her a scab because their original teacher was striking, and she begins to feel empty in that job, too. Joy is also constantly let down in her personal life. After a rejected suitor, Andy (Jon Lovitz), calls Joy shallow at the beginning of the film and then goes on to kill himself, Helen tries to set her up with other men. Expecting to hear from a suitor, she instead gets an obscene call from Allen. Later one of her Russian students, Vlad (Jared Harris), offers her a ride in his taxi and they end up having sex. She is initially smitten, but she soon realizes Vlad was using her and that he may be married. After being attacked by his wife and lending him $500 in return for the guitar and stereo he stole from her, she is back to being alone. Finally, the sisters' parents, Mona and Lenny, are separating after 40 years of marriage, but will not get divorced. Lenny (Ben Gazzara) is bored with his marriage, but does not want to start another relationship; he simply \\"wants to be alone.\\" As Mona (Louise Lasser) copes with being single during her twilight years, Lenny tries to rekindle his enthusiasm for life by having an affair with a neighbor. It is no use, however, as Lenny eventually finds that he has become incapable of feeling. The only person who seems happy at the end is Billy, who throughout the film attempts to make himself ejaculate and finally succeeds after masturbating to a sunbather in a bikini.

The Sundance Film Festival refused to accept the film, alleging it to be too disagreeable.\\"Happiness di Todd Solondz: quando la felicit√† √® una chimera‚Ä¶\\". Published at Cinema 10. October Films was the initial distributor for the film and even helped financed it. However, October Films' owner Seagram refused to release the movie and dropped it from the company. Good Machine ended up releasing the movie on their own, creating a new distribution arm in the process. =Rating= Due to adult themes, Happiness received an NC-17 rating from the MPAA, and that caused the film to be limited in distribution; the film also had difficulty in advertising. For that particular reason, Happiness surrendered its NC-17 rating and was instead released unrated. Reception =Critical reception= Roger Ebert gave the film four out of four stars, and rated it number 5 in his top 10 films of 1998. In his review, he wrote: \\"...the depraved are only seeking what we all seek, but with a lack of ordinary moral vision... In a film that looks into the abyss of human despair, there is the horrifying suggestion that these characters may not be grotesque exceptions, but may in fact be part of the mainstream of humanity.... It is not a film for most people. It is certainly for adults only. But it shows Todd Solondz as a filmmaker who deserves attention, who hears the unhappiness in the air and seeks its sources.\\" In a letter written to playwright Robert Patrick, Quentin Crisp stated that Happiness \\"mistook pleasure for happiness and was quite absurd\\". In his review in Time Out New York, Andrew Johnston observed, \\"As repulsive as some of the characters are, Solondz makes most of them deeply sympathetic. And every scene works on several levels at once: The film's most hilarious moments all have poignant undercurrents, while the saddest--and most disturbing--are frequently sidesplitting at the same time.\\" On review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an 81% approval rating based on 48 critic reviews, with an average rating of 7.82/10. The site's critical consensus states that \\"Happiness is far from a cheerful viewing experience, but its grimly humorous script and fearless performances produce a perversely moving search for humanity within everyday depravity.\\" On Metacritic, the film holds a rating of 81 out of 100 based on 30 reviews, indicating \\"universal acclaim\\". =Awards= * 1998 Cannes Film Festival ‚Äì FIPRESCI Prize, Parallel Sections * 1999 Golden Globes ‚Äì Nominated for Best Screenplay (Todd Solondz) * 1998 National Board of Review, USA ‚Äì Best Acting by an Ensemble * 1999 Independent Spirit Awards ‚Äì Nominated for Best Director (Todd Solondz), Best Male Lead (Dylan Baker), Best Supporting Male (Philip Seymour Hoffman) * 1998 S√£o Paulo International Film Festival ‚Äì International Jury Award * 1998 Fort Lauderdale International Film Festival ‚Äì Critic's Choice Award: Best Actor ‚Äì Dylan Baker; Best Film * 1998 Toronto International Film Festival ‚Äì Metro Media Award * 1999 British Independent Film Award ‚Äì Best Foreign Film, English Language * 1999 Fantasporto ‚Äì Directors' Week Award ‚Äì Todd Solondz Music Robbie Kondor wrote the film's score.

He also served several terms in the Tennessee House of Representatives, and was Speaker of the House for the 1855‚Äì1857 term. A lifelong Whig, Brown campaigned to keep Tennessee in the Union in the years leading up to the Civil War. However, once the war began, he sided with the Confederacy. Early life Brown was born in Giles County, Tennessee, the son of Duncan and Margaret Smith Brown. His ancestors were Scots-Irish, and his grandfather, Angus Brown, was a veteran of the American Revolution. His father was an ardent Whig. Brown enrolled in the Manual Labor Academy in Spring Hill, Tennessee, and taught school in Giles County to pay his way. After studying law under Judge James Trimble, he was admitted to the bar in 1834, and briefly practiced in Pulaski, Tennessee. In 1835, Brown moved to Texas, but quickly grew disillusioned with the lack of organization there, and returned to Tennessee after a few months. In 1836, he fought with the First Tennessee Mounted Volunteers in the Second Seminole War, and eventually rose to the rank of sergeant-major. Tennessee politics Brown was a founding member of Tennessee's Whig Party. He was an elector for Hugh Lawson White in 1836,Phillip Langsdon, Tennessee: A Political History (Franklin, Tenn.: Hillsboro Press, 2000), pp. 117‚Äì121, 158. and campaigned for William Henry Harrison and Henry Clay in the presidential elections of 1840 and 1844, respectively. He was elected to the Tennessee House of Representatives in 1837, becoming the legislature's youngest member during the 1837-1839 term.Joseph Baylen, \\"A Tennessee Politician in Imperial Russia, 1850-1853,\\" Tennessee Historical Quarterly, Vol. 14 (1955), pp. 227‚Äì252. In 1843, Brown ran a competitive race against Democratic incumbent Aaron V. Brown (no relation) for the 6th District congressional seat, but was defeated. In 1847, Brown won the Whig nomination for governor. His opponent was once again Aaron Brown, who had been elected governor in 1845. Aaron Brown, an associate of President James K. Polk, was an ardent supporter of the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War, while Neill Brown opposed it. The war was initially popular, but Tennesseans had grown weary of it by 1847, and Neill Brown was able to win the election by a narrow margin. The Whigs also gained control of the state legislature. During Brown's lone term as governor, he oversaw the completion of a state school for the blind in Nashville and a state school for the deaf in Knoxville, both of which were launched during the administration of fellow Whig governor James C. Jones earlier in the decade. Brown also signed a law calling for true public schools to be established throughout the state, but it was left to local governments to implement the provisions of this law, and very little was to come out of it. The end of the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War raised the issue of the expansion of slavery into the newly acquired territory. Brown opposed the Wilmot Proviso, which called for slavery to be banned in all territory acquired as a result of the war, but the division in the national Whig Party on the issue damaged the party's image in slave-holding Tennessee. Though Brown fought a competitive campaign in 1849, he was defeated in his bid for reelection by General William Trousdale. Minister to Russia Following Brown's defeat in the Tennessee gubernatorial race of 1849, President Zachary Taylor, at the urging of Tennessee Whig Senator John Bell, appointed Brown U.S. Minister to Russia on May 2, 1850. Brown arrived in St. Petersburg in late July 1850, and was presented to Emperor Nicholas I on August 13, 1850. Unaccustomed to the harsh Russian winter, Brown fell ill just a few months after his arrival, and briefly resigned as minister in January 1851, stating that the Russian climate was \\"unfitting for the abodes of Man.\\" Upon his recovery in March 1851, however, he withdrew his resignation. Portrait of Brown by Nicola Marschall Brown arrived in Russia at a turbulent time in Russo-American affairs. The Emperor was uneasy about the recent Revolutions of 1848, which consisted largely of democratic revolts against monarchies, and was aware that many Americans sympathized with these revolts. Americans, likewise, were angry over Russia's intervention in the Hungarian Revolution of 1848 and its deposing of pro-democracy leader Lajos Kossuth, and some Americans were calling for intervention on behalf of the revolutionaries. Though Brown personally disapproved of Nicholas's actions, he nevertheless warned American leaders that Kossuth was a troublemaker, and argued that American intervention would be disastrous. Brown had a somewhat pessimistic view of Russian society. He stated that Russians lacked the spirit of invention, and were consistently copying other countries' innovations in both industry and art. \\"All they have is borrowed,\\" he wrote, \\"except the miserable climate.\\" While he praised Nicholas's work ethic, he thought the emperor micromanaged his various departments. Brown was constantly frustrated by bureaucratic delays, and found Russian censorship of mail and media appalling. He was also puzzled by the rise of slavophilia, which he believed could not compete with western culture. In spite of his misgivings about Russian society, Brown urged the United States to compete in the vast Russian market. He helped convince the Emperor to abandon an increase in duties on cotton imports, and secured Russian approval of the Clayton‚ÄìBulwer Treaty between the U.S. and Britain. In his last weeks in office, Brown expressed concern over the build-up to the Crimean War, and the effect such a conflict might have on U.S. commercial interests. Secession crisis, the Civil War and later life Upon his return from Russia, Brown resumed his role as a leader of Tennessee's Whigs. After the collapse of the national Whig Party, he aligned himself with the American Party (\\"Know Nothings\\"), and in 1855 was once again elected to the state House of Representatives, this time representing Davidson County. He was selected as speaker shortly afterward. In the mid-1850s, Brown campaigned across the state on behalf of presidential candidate Millard Fillmore, but was largely outshone by rising Democratic politician and future Confederate governor Isham Harris, who was campaigning on behalf of James Buchanan.Memorial Addresses on the Character of Isham G. Harris (Washington, D.C.: Government Printing Office, 1898), p. 56. Brown attended the Constitutional Union Party convention in 1860, and helped nominate fellow Tennessean John Bell as the party's presidential candidate.Oliver Perry Temple, East Tennessee and the Civil War (Johnson City, Tenn.: Overmountain Press, 1995), pp. 122, 219-220, 228-229. On April 18, 1861, following the attack on Fort Sumter in South Carolina, Brown and several other Whig leaders published a letter reaffirming their pro-Union stance. While they dismissed secession, \\"both as a constitutional right and as a remedy for existing evils,\\" they nevertheless stated that Tennessee and other southern states were obliged to defend themselves should federal troops invade. In May 1861, Oliver Perry Temple, a Whig attorney from Knoxville, met with Brown and several other Whig leaders in Nashville. Temple later recalled that Brown seemed \\"paralyzed\\" by the rapid rise of secessionist sentiment in the city, but nevertheless delivered an \\"eloquent\\" denunciation of secession. Shortly after this meeting, however, Brown abandoned his support for the Union, and marched with a parade in Nashville in support of the new Confederate States of America. When Union soldiers occupied Nashville in 1862, Brown was jailed and his house was burned. Following the war, Tennessee's radical governor, William Brownlow, ordered the arrest of Isham Harris, and offered a $5,000 reward for his capture. Exiled in England, but longing to return to Tennessee, Harris contacted Brown in 1867, and asked for his help. Brown paid a visit to Brownlow, with whom he had campaigned throughout the 1850s, and appealed for clemency on Harris's behalf. Brownlow immediately granted the request and offered Harris immunity, and withdrew the arrest warrant.Oliver Perry Temple, Notable Men of Tennessee (New York: The Cosmopolitan Press, 1912), p. 337. Although Brown was not elevated to elective office post-war, his was an influential voice. He served on committees and gave an inspiring, heart-felt speech at the June 1868 Democratic State Convention.Nashville Union & Dispatch Convention Coverage June 10, 1868 Brown also attended the state constitutional convention of 1870, which composed the current Constitution of Tennessee. He also campaigned for his younger brother, John C. Brown, who served as governor of Tennessee from 1871 to 1875. Brown died on January 30, 1886, and is interred at Mount Olivet Cemetery in Nashville, Tennessee.

He served as Governor of Tennessee from 1851 to 1853, and was the state's last Whig governor. He also served four terms in the United States House of Representatives, from 1837 to 1843, and from 1866 to 1867.John Thweatt, \\"William Bowen Campbell,\\" Tennessee Encyclopedia of History and Culture, 2009.

During the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War, Campbell commanded the First Regiment Tennessee Volunteers, known as the \\"Bloody First\\" for its high casualty rate.Phillip Langsdon, Tennessee: A Political History (Franklin, Tenn.: Hillsboro Press, 2000), p. 125. At the outbreak of the American Civil War, Campbell opposed secession, and briefly served as a general in the Union Army.  Early life  Campbell was born on Mansker's Creek in Sumner County, Tennessee, to David and Catherine Bowen Campbell. He studied law at Abingdon, Virginia, with his father's cousin, Virginia Governor David Campbell, and attended lectures at Winchester Law School. He returned to Tennessee in 1829 in order to establish a law practice at Carthage, in Smith County. He was admitted to the bar in 1830. In 1831, he was appointed attorney general for a state circuit, and moved to Sparta, Tennessee.  Military and political career  In 1835, Campbell moved back to Carthage, and was elected to Smith County's seat in the Tennessee House of Representatives. He resigned his seat in 1836, however, in order to fight in the Second Seminole War. He served as a captain under Colonel William Trousdale. In 1837, Campbell successfully ran against Trousdale for the state's 6th District seat in the United States House of Representatives. The campaign was \\"spirited,\\" though there was no bitterness between the two candidates. In 1839, Campbell ran for reelection, again defeating Trousdale. He ran unopposed in 1841. Near the end of his third term in 1843 he resigned and returned to his law practice in Carthage. That same year, he was appointed major-general of the Tennessee militia. Upon the outbreak of the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War in 1846, Campbell answered Tennessee Governor Aaron V. Brown's call for volunteers. He was elected colonel of the First Regiment Tennessee Volunteers on June 3, 1846, and arrived with his regiment in Texas the following month.St. George L. Sioussat, \\"Mexican War Letters of Col. William Bowen Campbell, of Tennessee, Written to Governor David Campbell, of Virginia, 1846-1847,\\" Tennessee Historical Magazine, Vol. 1, No. 2 (June 1915), pp. 129‚Äì135. At the Battle of Monterrey later that year, this company lost one-third of its men in an assault on the town's citadel, earning the nickname, the \\"Bloody First.\\" Campbell's company also saw action at the Siege of Veracruz and the Battle of Cerro Gordo in 1847. After the war, Campbell was appointed by the legislature to a state circuit court judgeship. In 1851, he received the Whig nomination for governor. His opponent was William Trousdale, his old Seminole War superior, who had been elected in a close election in 1849. Trousdale had endorsed the Nashville Convention of 1850, in which southern states threatened to secede if the federal government attempted to ban slavery in newly acquired territories, and blasted the Compromise of 1850, which admitted California as a free state. He accused Campbell of being \\"too favorable to northern views.\\" Campbell on the other hand called the Compromise a \\"work of wisdom,\\"Stanley Folmsbee, Robert Corlew, and Enoch Mitchell, Tennessee: A Short History (Knoxville: University of Tennessee Press, 1969), pp. 230‚Äì232. and derided the Nashville Convention as treasonous. Running with the campaign slogan, \\"Boys, follow me!\\" which he had yelled at the Battle of Monterrey, Campbell edged Trousdale by a vote of 63,333 to 61,673.Philip Hamer, Tennessee: A History, 1673‚Äì1932, Vol. 1 (New York: American Historical Society, Inc., 1933), pp. 482‚Äì485. As governor, Campbell called for a more rational approach to resolving sectional strife, and demanded an end to the \\"insane\\" talk of secession. After his initial term in 1853, he did not run for reelection, instead choosing to accept a position as President of the Bank of Middle Tennessee in Lebanon, Tennessee. The Whigs nominated Gustavus A. Henry, who was defeated by the Democratic candidate Andrew Johnson in the general election.  Secession and the Civil War  Following the collapse of the Whig Party in the mid-1850s, Campbell threw his support behind the American Party (\\"Know Nothings\\"), which many Tennessee Whigs had joined. He was again appointed to a circuit court judgeship in 1859, and continued campaigning against secession. In 1860, he supported Constitutional Union Party candidate and fellow Tennessee Whig John Bell for president. In May 1861, as a wave of pro-secession sentiment swept through Middle Tennessee in the wake of the attack on Fort Sumter, Tennessee's ex-Whigs and others opposed to secession convened in Nashville, and nominated Campbell to oppose Isham Harris in the gubernatorial election later that year. Campbell declined this offer, however.Oliver Perry Temple, East Tennessee and the Civil War (Johnson City, Tenn.: Overmountain Press, 1995), pp. 227‚Äì228. Governor Harris offered him a command in the Confederate Army, but he declined this, as well. In early 1862, after the Union Army occupied Middle Tennessee, Assistant Secretary of War Thomas A. Scott recommended Campbell for military governor, but the appointment went to Andrew Johnson. On May 12, 1862, Campbell chaired a convention of Tennessee Unionists that mapped out a plan to bring the state back into the Union.Philip Hamer, Tennessee: A History, 1673‚Äì1932, Vol. 2 (New York: American Historical Society, Inc., 1933), p. 573. Shortly afterward, President Abraham Lincoln appointed him brigadier general in the Union Army. He accepted this commission, but resigned in January 1863, in part for health issues, and in part because he did not want to fight against his friends and neighbors. In 1864, Campbell aligned himself with the Democratic Party, and supported George B. McClellan for the presidency. Though he disagreed with Johnson over several issues, namely election regulations Johnson had installed as military governor, he generally supported the Johnson presidency's Reconstruction policies. After the war, Campbell was elected to the state's 5th District seat in the House of Representatives, but was prevented by Radical Republicans from taking his seat for several months. Campbell defended Johnson during his impeachment hearings in the House in 1867, and served as an advisor during his trial in the Senate.  Death  Camp Bell, Campbell's family home. Campbell died on August 19, 1867 at his family home of Camp Bell. He is interred at Cedar Grove Cemetery in Lebanon, Tennessee.  Family  William Bowen Campbell was a great-grandson of two early Scots-Irish Virginia pioneers, \\"Black\\" David Campbell (b. 1710) and \\"White\\" David Campbell (b. 1706). His paternal grandfather, a son of \\"Black David\\" known as Captain David Campbell (1753‚Äì1832), was an early Knox County pioneer who built Campbell's Station, which has evolved into modern Farragut, Tennessee. Captain David Campbell was married to Margaret Campbell, a daughter of \\"White David.\\" Her brothers (i.e., William B. Campbell's great-uncles) included Colonel Arthur Campbell (1743‚Äì1811) and Judge David Campbell (1750‚Äì1812), and her nephews included Governor David Campbell (1779‚Äì1859) and Colonel John B. Campbell (1777‚Äì1814). She was a cousin of General William Campbell of Kings Mountain fame.Margaret Campbell Pilcher, Historical Sketches of the Campbell, Pilcher and Kindred Families (Nashville: Marshall and Bruce Company, 1911). Campbell's mother, Catherine Bowen, was a granddaughter of General William Russell (1735‚Äì1793), who had helped draft the Declaration of Independence. The house built in 1787 by Campbell's maternal grandfather, Captain William Bowen (1742‚Äì1804), still stands in modern Goodlettsville, and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places as the Bowen-Campbell House.David Calease, Layton Carr, Keith Shumann, Carroll Van West, The War of 1812 in Tennessee Driving Tour: Possible Sites to be Included, January 2011, p. 5. A house built by Campbell's uncle, John Henry Bowen (1770‚Äì1822), still stands in Gallatin, and is listed on the National Register as the Trousdale Place. After his uncle's death, the house was, ironically, purchased by William Trousdale, Campbell's future gubernatorial opponent. Campbell married Frances Owen in 1835.

The award is retroactive to the establishment of the U.S. Air Force as an independent service in September 1947. The ribbon is also retroactive for any service with the U.S. Army Air Forces, U.S. Army Air Corps, or U.S. Army Air Service prior to the creation of the U.S. Air Force as a separate service as long as the serviceman was on active duty on or after 18 September 1947. Criteria The Air Force Longevity Service Award is awarded for completing four years of Active, Air Force Reserve, or Air National Guard service. For members of the Air Force Reserve and Air National Guard, creditable service must have been in a drilling status with regular attendance of at least minimum monthly weekend drills and annual training. Air Force Reserve and Air National Guard mobilized to full-time active duty continue to accrue eligibility in the same manner as active duty Air Force personnel. Service as a student at a United States service academy, typically the USAF Academy, is also creditable so long as the member graduated. The ribbon is awarded to both officers and enlisted personnel, in contrast to service stripes which are only provided to enlisted members of the military.

He was the state's first governor from West Tennessee. A pivotal figure in the state's history, Harris was considered by his contemporaries the person most responsible for leading Tennessee out of the Union and aligning it with the Confederacy during the Civil War.Allan Nevins, Grover Cleveland: A Study in Courage (New York: Dodd, Mead, 1934), pp. 194, 256, 543-546, 576.Philip Hamer, Tennessee: A History, 1673-1932 (New York: American Historical Society, Inc., 1933), pp. 508, 513‚Äì514, 527‚Äì528, 534, 539‚Äì546, 554, 591, 639.Oliver Perry Temple, Notable Men of Tennessee (New York: The Cosmopolitan Press, 1912), p. 337. Harris rose to prominence in state politics in the late 1840s when he campaigned against the anti-slavery initiatives of northern Whigs. He was elected governor amidst rising sectional strife in the late 1850s, and following the election of Abraham Lincoln in 1860, persistently sought to sever the state's ties with the Union. His war- time efforts eventually raised over 100,000 soldiers for the Confederate cause. After the Union Army gained control of Middle and West Tennessee in 1862, Harris spent the remainder of the war on the staffs of various Confederate generals. Following the war, he spent several years in exile in Mexico and England.Leonard Schlup, \\"Isham Green Harris,\\" Tennessee Encyclopedia of History and Culture, 2009. Retrieved: 5 October 2012. After returning to Tennessee, Harris became a leader of the state's Bourbon Democrats. During his tenure in the U. S. Senate, he championed states' rights and currency expansion. As the Senate's president pro tempore in the 1890s, Harris led the charge against President Grover Cleveland's attempts to repeal the Sherman Silver Purchase Act.Leonard Schlup, \\"Isham Green Harris,\\" Historical Dictionary of the Gilded Age (New York: M. E. Sharpe, 2003), pp. 216‚Äì217. Early life and career Harris was born in Franklin County, Tennessee near Tullahoma. He was the ninth child of Isham Green Harris, a farmer and Methodist minister, and his wife Lucy Davidson Harris. His parents had moved from North Carolina to Middle Tennessee in 1806. He was educated at Carrick Academy in Winchester, Tennessee, until he was fourteen. He moved to Paris, Tennessee, where he joined up with his brother William, an attorney, and became a store clerk. In 1838, with funds provided by his brother, Harris established his own business in Ripley, Mississippi, an area that had only been recently opened to settlers after a treaty with the Chickasaw Indians.Hall (1985) p.185. Elliott (2009) Chapter 1 kindle location 222‚Äì279. While in Ripley, Harris studied law. He sold his successful business three years later for $7,000 and returned to Paris where he continued studying law under Judge Andrew McCampbell. On May 3, 1841, he was admitted to the bar in Henry County and began a lucrative practice in Paris. He was considered one of the leading criminal attorneys in the state. On July 6, 1843, Harris married Martha Mariah Travis (nicknamed \\"Crockett\\"), the daughter of Major Edward Travis, a War of 1812 veteran. The couple had seven sons. By 1850 the family had a farm and a home in Paris. By 1860 their total property was worth $45,000 and included twenty slaves and a plantation in Shelby County.Hall (1985) p.185. Elliott (2009) Chapter 1 kindle location 300‚Äì333. In 1847, Henry County Democrats convinced Harris to run for the district's Tennessee Senate seat in hopes of countering a strong campaign by local Whig politician William Hubbard. Anti-war comments made in August by the district's Whig congressional candidate, William T. Haskell, damaged Hubbard's campaign, and he quit the race. Harris easily defeated the last minute Whig replacement, Joseph Roerlhoe. Shortly after taking his seat, he sponsored a resolution condemning the Wilmot Proviso, which would have banned slavery in territories acquired during the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War.Sam Davis Elliott, Isham G. Harris: Confederate Governor and United States Senator of Tennessee (Baton Rouge: Louisiana State University Press, 2010), pp. 15‚Äì19. In 1848, Harris was an elector for unsuccessful presidential candidate Lewis Cass. In May of that year, he engaged in a six-hour debate in Clarksville with Aaron Goodrich, elector for Zachary Taylor. Harris was nominated as the Democratic candidate for the state's 9th District seat in the U.S. House of Representatives in 1849. After successfully tying his opponent to unpopular positions of the national Whig Party, Harris won the election easily. He spent much of his term attacking the Compromise of 1850, though he also chaired the House Committee on Invalid Pensions. Harris was re-elected to a second term, but after Whigs gained control of the state legislature in 1851, his district was gerrymandered, and he did not seek a third term. Governor of Tennessee In 1856, Harris was chosen as the presidential elector for the state's at-large district, a position that required him to canvass the state on behalf of Democratic candidate James Buchanan. He largely outshone the district's Whig elector, ex-Governor Neill S. Brown.Memorial Addresses on the Character of Isham G. Harris (Washington, D.C.: Government Printing Office, 1898), p. 56. This campaign elevated Harris to statewide prominence. Washington B. Cooper In 1857, Tennessee's Democratic governor, Andrew Johnson, was seriously injured in a train accident and was unable to run for reelection.Phillip Langsdon, Tennessee: A Political History (Franklin, Tenn.: Hillsboro Press, 2000), pp. 128, 134, 140‚Äì146, 150‚Äì154, 176. Harris was nominated as his replacement and embarked on a campaign that included a series of debates with his opponent, Robert H. Hatton. With sectional strife in Congress fueling both campaigns, these debates were often heated, and fights frequently broke out among spectators (and in one instance, between Harris and Hatton). Hatton was unable to distance himself from northern abolitionists, and Harris won the election by a vote of 71,178 to 59,807. Harris's victory was not only the death knell for the state's Know Nothings,Stanley Folmsbee, Robert Corlew, and Enoch Mitchell, Tennessee: A Short History (Knoxville: University of Tennessee Press, 1969), pp. 238‚Äì239, 314. who had briefly risen to prominence following the collapse of the national Whig Party, but also represented a shift in Tennessee politics toward the Democratic Party. During the previous two decades, Whigs and Democrats had been evenly matched statewide, with Whigs controlling East Tennessee, Democrats controlling Middle Tennessee, and the two parties evenly split in West Tennessee. The nationwide debate over the Kansas‚ÄìNebraska Act and the Dred Scott case pushed the issue of slavery to the forefront in the mid-1850s, and the balance in West Tennessee was tipped in favor of the Democrats. Harris's 11,000 vote victory was relatively large, considering his predecessor, Johnson, had won by just over 2,000 votes in both 1853 and 1855. In 1859, Harris ran for reelection against John Netherland, who had been nominated by a hodge-podge group of ex-Whigs, ex-Know Nothings, and disgruntled Democrats, known as the Opposition Party. Harris again campaigned on fears of northern domination, while Netherland argued that the U.S. Constitution provided the best protection for Southern rights, and thus it was in the state's interest to remain in the Union. On election day, Harris prevailed by over 8,000 votes. The Opposition Party, however, showed its strength by capturing 7 of the state's 10 congressional seats. Secession and the Civil War Harris, photographed as a member of General Albert Sidney Johnston's staff during the Civil War Harris endorsed John C. Breckinridge for president in 1860, and warned that the state must consider secession if the \\"reckless fanatics of the north\\" should gain control of the federal government. Following Lincoln's election in November, Harris convened a special session of the legislature on January 7, 1861, which ordered a statewide referendum on whether or not Tennessee should consider secession. Pro-Union newspapers assailed Harris's actions as treasonous. The Huntingdon Carroll Patriot wrote that Harris was more deserving of the gallows than Benedict Arnold. William \\"Parson\\" Brownlow, editor of the Knoxville Whig, particularly despised Harris, calling him \\"Eye Sham\\" and \\"King Harris,\\" and slammed his actions as autocratic.E. Merton Coulter, William G. Brownlow: Fighting Parson of the Southern Highlands (Knoxville, Tenn.: University of Tennessee Press, 1999), pp. 146, 344. When the referendum was held in February, Tennesseans rejected secession by a vote of 68,000 to 59,000. Following the Battle of Fort Sumter in April 1861, President Lincoln ordered Harris to furnish 50,000 soldiers for the suppression of the rebellion. Reading his response to Lincoln before a raucous crowd in Nashville on April 17, Harris said, \\"Not a single man will be furnished from Tennessee,\\" and stated he would rather cut off his right arm than sign the order. On April 25, Harris addressed a special session of the state legislature, stating that the Union had been destroyed by the \\"bloody and tyrannical policies of the Presidential usurper,\\" and called for an end to the state's ties to the United States. Shortly afterward, the legislature authorized Harris to enter into a compact with the new Confederate States of America. In May 1861, Harris began organizing and raising soldiers for what would become the Army of Tennessee. That same month, a steamboat, the Hillman, which was carrying a shipment of lead to Nashville from St. Louis, was seized by the Governor of Illinois. In response, Harris seized $75,000 from the customs office in Nashville. On June 8, 1861, Tennesseans voted in favor of the Ordinance of Secession, 104,913 to 47,238. A group of pro-Union leaders in East Tennessee, which had rejected the Ordinance, petitioned Harris to allow the region to break away from the state and remain with the Union. Harris rejected this, and sent troops under Felix K. Zollicoffer into East Tennessee. In the gubernatorial election later that year, William H. Polk, brother of former President James K. Polk, ran against Harris on a pro-Union ticket but was defeated 75,300 to 43,495. The Union Army invaded Tennessee in November 1861 and had gained control of Nashville by February of the following year. Harris and the state legislature moved to Memphis, but after that city fell, Harris joined the staff of General Albert Sidney Johnston. At the Battle of Shiloh on April 6, Harris found Johnston slumping in his saddle and asked if he was wounded, to which Johnston replied \\"Yes, and I fear seriously.\\" Harris and other staff officers moved the general to a small ravine and attempted to render aid, but Johnston died within a few minutes. Harris and the others secretly moved his body to Shiloh Church so as not to dampen the morale of Confederate troops. Harris spent the remainder of the war as an aide-de-camp on the staffs of various Confederate generals, among them Joseph E. Johnston, Braxton Bragg, John B. Hood, and P. G. T. Beauregard. Andrew Johnson was appointed military governor by President Lincoln in March 1862, though Harris was still recognized as governor by the Confederacy. In 1863, Tennessee's Confederates elected Robert L. Caruthers as a successor to Harris, but Caruthers never took office. Harris was still issuing edicts as governor as late as November 1864. After the war, the United States Congress passed a joint resolution allowing the governor of Tennessee to offer a reward for the apprehension of Harris because he was \\"guilty of treason, perjury and theft\\".p. 80, United States. Congress. Report of the Joint Committee on Reconstruction at the First Session Thirty-ninth Congress. Washington, DC: Government Printing Office, 1866. Brownlow, who had become governor, issued a warrant for the arrest of Harris and placed a $5,000 bounty on him. Brownlow taunted Harris in the warrant, stating, \\"His eyes are deep and penetrating‚Äîa perfect index to a heart of a traitor‚Äîwith the scowl and frown of a demon resting upon his brow. His study of mischief and the practice of crime have brought upon him premature baldness and a gray beard.\\" He further noted that Harris \\"chews tobacco rapidly and is inordinately fond of liquors.\\" Harris fled to Mexico, where he and several other ex-Confederates attempted to rally with Emperor Maximilian.Bob Leith, \\"Southerners Seek Safer Pastures,\\" Ironton Tribune, 3 June 2012. Retrieved: 6 October 2012. After Maximilian's fall in 1867, however, Harris was again forced to flee, this time to England. Later that year, after learning Brownlow would rescind the warrant, Harris returned to Tennessee. Passing through Nashville, he called on Brownlow, who is said to have greeted him with the statement, \\"While the lamp holds out to burn, the vilest sinner may return.\\" Afterward, he returned to Memphis to practice law. United States Senate Puck magazine in 1886 By 1877, the Tennessee state legislature, which was once again controlled by Democrats, elected Harris to one of the state's U.S. Senate seats. One of his earliest assignments, in the 46th Congress (1879‚Äì81), was the District of Columbia Committee. Subsequent assignments included the Committee on Epidemic Diseases in the 49th Congress through the 52nd Congress (1885‚Äì93) and the Committee on Private Land Claims in the 54th Congress (1895‚Äì97). During his first term in the Senate, Harris became the leader of Tennessee's Bourbon Democrats, a wing of the Democratic Party that generally supported laissez- faire capitalism and the gold standard. As such, Harris spent his early Senate career advocating strict constructionism and limited government, states' rights, and low tariffs. In 1884, he was interviewed by President-elect Grover Cleveland for a cabinet position. In 1887, he gave an impassioned speech in favor of the repeal of the Tenure of Office Act. In 1890, Harris denounced the Lodge Bill, which would have protected voting rights for African-Americans in the South, arguing that it violated states' rights. Though a Bourbon Democrat, Harris, representing an agrarian state, was also a \\"Silver Democrat\\", believing pro-silver policies protected farmers. He supported the Bland‚ÄìAllison Act of 1878, which authorized the federal government to purchase silver to prevent deflation in crop prices. He also supported the act's replacement, the Sherman Silver Purchase Act of 1890. In 1893, President Cleveland, concerned that the Sherman Act was depleting the U.S. gold supply, sought its repeal. When the vote came up in the Senate in October, Harris, as president pro tempore, launched a filibuster in hopes of preventing the act's repeal, but was unsuccessful. Disgruntled over the repeal of the Sherman Act, Harris campaigned for unsuccessful presidential candidate and gold standard opponent William Jennings Bryan in 1896. Death and legacy Harris's grave at Elmwood Cemetery Harris died in office on July 8, 1897. His funeral was held in the Senate chamber of the United States Capitol. Congressman Walter P. Brownlow, a nephew of Harris' old rival Parson Brownlow, was among those who delivered a memorial address in his honor.Walter P. Brownlow, \\"Memorial Address for Isham G. Harris\\" (Government Printing Office, 1898), pp. 105-115. He is interred at Elmwood Cemetery in Memphis.

The Creeping Unknown in the United States) is a 1955 British science fiction horror film drama from Hammer Film Productions, based on the 1953 BBC Television serial The Quatermass Experiment written by Nigel Kneale. The film was produced by Anthony Hinds, directed by Val Guest, and stars Brian Donlevy as the eponymous Professor Bernard Quatermass and Richard Wordsworth as the tormented Carroon. Jack Warner, David King-Wood, and Margia Dean appear in co-starring roles. The film's storyline concerns three astronauts that have been launched into space aboard a single stage to orbit rocket. The returning spacecraft, designed by Professor Quatermass, crash lands with only one of its original crew aboard, Victor Carroon (Richard Wordsworth). Something has infected him during the spaceflight, and he begins mutating into an alien organism which, if it spawns, will engulf the Earth and destroy humanity. When the mutating Carroon escapes from custody, Quatermass and Scotland Yard's Inspector Lomax (Jack Warner), have just hours to track it down and prevent a catastrophe. Like its source TV serial, the film was a major success in the UK and brought public attention to Hammer Film Productions' name around the world. The film's US release was as a double feature with The Black Sleep.McGee, Mark Thomas; Robertson, R.J. (2013). \\"You Won't Believe Your Eyes\\". Bear Manor Media. . Page 254 Plot The British- American Rocket Group, headed by the taciturn Professor Bernard Quatermass, launches its first manned rocket into outer space. Shortly thereafter, all contact is lost with the rocket and its three-man crew: Carroon, Reichenheim and Green. The large rocket later returns to Earth, crashing into an English country field. Quatermass and his assistant Marsh arrive at the scene. With them are the local emergency services, Carroon's wife Judith, Rocket Group physician Dr. Briscoe and Blake, a Ministry official who chides Quatermass repeatedly for launching the rocket without official permission. The rocket's hatch is finally opened, and the space-suited Carroon stumbles out. There is no sign of the other two crew. Carroon is in shock, only able to say the words, \\"Help me\\". Inside the rocket, Quatermass and Marsh find only the fastened but completely empty spacesuits of the two missing men. Carroon is taken to Briscoe's laboratory facility on the grounds that conventional hospitals and doctors would have no idea how to evaluate or treat the world's first returned astronaut, now suffering from some sort of adverse outer space event. Even under Briscoe's attentive care, Carroon remains mute, generally immobile, but alert with eyes that now have a feral and cunning quality. Briscoe discovers an oddly disfigured area on his shoulder and notices changes in his face, suggesting some sort of mutation of the underlying bone structure. Meanwhile, Scotland Yard Inspector Lomax has undertaken investigation of the other two men's disappearance and, having surreptitiously fingerprinted Carroon as a suspect, alerts Quatermass that the prints are like nothing human. At Judith's insistence that Briscoe is not helping her husband, Quatermass agrees to have Carroon transferred to a regular hospital, under guard. Marsh, meanwhile, has developed the film from the rocket's interior view camera, and Quatermass, Lomax and Briscoe watch it. The crew are seen for a time at their duties, then suddenly, something seems to heavily buffet the ship. After that, there is a nightmarish wavering distortion of the cabin's atmosphere, and the men react as if something frightening, yet not visible, is there with them. One by one they collapse, Carroon being the last. Quatermass and Briscoe determine from the evidence that something living in outer space has entered the spaceship, dissolved Reichenheim and Green in their sealed spacesuits, and evidently entered Carroon's body, who is now in the process of being transformed by this unknown entity. Not knowing any of this, Carroon's wife, Judith, hires a private investigator, Christie, to break her husband out of the secured hospital. The escape is successful, but not before Carroon smashes a potted cactus in his hospital room, which fuses to his flesh. In the lift he kills Chistie and absorbs the life force in his body, leaving a shrivelled husk. Judith quickly discovers what is happening to her husband. Carroon disappears into the London night, leaving her unharmed, but completely traumatized. Inspector Lomax initiates a manhunt for Carroon, who goes to a nearby chemist's shop and kills the chemist, using his swollen, crusty, cactus-thorn-riddled hand and arm as a cudgel and leaving a twisted, empty man-husk to be found by the police. Quatermass theorizes that Carroon has taken select chemicals to \\"speed up a change going on inside of him\\". After hiding on a river barge, Carroon encounters a little girl, leaving her unharmed through sheer force of will. That night he is in the zoo, barely visible amongst some shadowed bushes, now with far less of his human form remaining. In the morning, scattered animal carcasses are found, their life forces having been absorbed, with a slime trail leading away from the zoo. Among the bushes, Quatermass and Briscoe also find a small but living remnant of Carroon, and take it back to their laboratory. Following an examination, Quatermass concludes that some kind of predatory alien life has completely taken over and will eventually release reproduction spores, endangering the entire planet. The remnant, having now grown much larger, breaks out of its glass cage, but dies of starvation on the floor. On a police tip from a vagrant, Lomax and his men track the Carroon mutation to Westminster Abbey, where it has crawled high up on a metalwork scaffolding. It is now a gigantic shapeless mass of combined animal and plant tissue with eyes, distended nodules, and tentacle-like fronds filled with spores. Quatermass arrives and orders London's electrical power centres be combined and the generated power quickly diverted to the Abbey. Heavy duty electrical cable is run and attached to the bottom of the metal scaffolding. The alien creature is cremated by electrocution before it can release its spores. The threat eliminated, Quatermass quickly walks out of the Abbey, preoccupied by his thoughts. He ignores all who ask questions. Marsh, his assistant, approaches and asks \\"What are you going to do?\\" Never breaking stride, Quatermass offhandedly replies, \\"I'm going to start again\\". He leaves Marsh behind, walking off into the dark, and sometime later a second manned rocketship roars into outer space.

Among the plot changes are the elimination of the gangster episode. The most significant plot change, however, occurs at the climax of the film. In the television version, Quatermass appeals to the last vestiges of the creature's humanity and convinces it to commit suicide to save the world. In the film Quatermass kills the creature by massive electrocution. Nigel Kneale was critical of the changes made for the film adaptation, and also of the casting of Brian Donlevy, whose brusque interpretation of Quatermass was not to his liking. To make the film's plot convincing to audiences, Guest employed a high degree of realism, directing the film in a style akin to a newsreel. The film was shot on location in London, Windsor, Bray, and at Hammer's Bray Studios. Carroon's transformation was effected by makeup artist Phil Leakey, who worked in conjunction with cinematographer Walter J. Harvey to accentuate Wordsworth's naturally gaunt features to give him an increasingly menacing, yet tragically in-pain, appearance. Special effects, including a model of the fully mutated creature seen at the climax, were provided by Les Bowie. The music was composed by James Bernard, the first of many scores he wrote for Hammer. Hammer marketed the film in the United Kingdom by dropping the \\"E\\" from \\"Experiment\\" in the title to emphasise the adults-only 'X' Certificate given to the film by the British Board of Film Censors. Upon general release in 1955, the film formed one half of the highest grossing double bill in the UK. It was the first Hammer production to attract the attention of a major US distributor, in this case United Artists, who distributed the film under the title The Creeping Unknown. Its success led to Hammer producing an increasing number of horror films, including two sequels Quatermass 2 (1957) and Quatermass and the Pit (1967), making them synonymous with the genre. The Quatermass Xperiment is regarded as the first of these \\"Hammer Horrors\\". =Development= The Quatermass Experiment was originally a six-part TV serial broadcast by BBC Television in 1953. Written by Nigel Kneale, it was an enormous success with critics and audiences alike, later described by film historian Robert Simpson as \\"event television, emptying the streets and pubs\\". Among its viewers was Hammer Films producer Anthony Hinds, who was immediately keen to buy the rights for a film version. Incorporated in 1934, Hammer had developed a niche for itself making second features, many of which were adaptations of successful BBC Radio productions. Hammer contacted the BBC on 24 August 1953, two days after the transmission of the final episode, to inquire about the film rights. Nigel Kneale also saw the potential for a film adaptation and, at his urging, the BBC touted the scripts around a number of producers, including the Boulting Brothers and Frank Launder and Sidney Gilliat. Kneale met with Sidney Gilliat to discuss the scripts but Gilliat was reluctant to buy the rights as he felt any film adaptation would inevitably receive an ‚ÄòX‚Äô Certificate from the British Board of Film Censors (BBFC), restricting admission to persons over the age of sixteen. Hammer was not so reticent, deciding from the outset that they would deliberately pursue an ‚ÄòX‚Äô Certificate. Hammer's offer met some resistance within the BBC, with one executive expressing reservations that The Quatermass Experiment was not suitable material for the company, but the rights were nevertheless sold for an advance of ¬£500. Nigel Kneale was a BBC employee at the time, which meant that his scripts were owned entirely by the BBC. He received no extra payment for the sale of the film rights. This became a matter of some resentment on Kneale's part, and when his BBC contract came up for renewal he demanded and secured control over any future film rights for his work. Despite this, Kneale remained bitter over the affair until the BBC made an ex-gratia payment of ¬£3,000 to him in 1967, in recognition of his creation of Quatermass. The film was co-produced by Robert L. Lippert, an American film producer and distributor. Hammer had entered into an arrangement with Lippert in 1951 under which Lippert provided finance and supplied American stars for Hammer's films and distributed them in the United States. In return Hammer's distribution arm, Exclusive Films, distributed Lippert's films in the United Kingdom. Quota laws in the UK meant that US films had to have a British supporting feature, so it was in the American studios' interests to fund these features to recover a greater proportion of the box office receipts. =Writing= The first draft of the screenplay was written by Richard Landau, an American who had worked on six previous Hammer productions, including Spaceways (1953), one of the company's first forays into science fiction. Landau made significant changes in condensing the action to less than half the length of the original teleplay. The opening thirty minutes of the television version are covered in just two minutes in the Hammer film. In the process Landau played up the horror elements of Kneale's original teleplay. Aware that the film would be co-funded by American backers, Landau added a transatlantic dimension to the script: Quatermass's \\"British Rocket Group\\" became the \\"British-American Rocket Group\\" and the character of his assistant, Briscoe, was rewritten as a US Air Force flight surgeon. Quatermass himself was demoted to a doctor and written much more as an action hero than the thoughtful scientist created by Nigel Kneale. Some characters from the television version, such as the journalist James Fullalove, are omitted altogether. Judith Carroon's role in the film version is reduced to little more than that of the stricken astronaut's anxious wife, whereas in the television version she is also a prominent member of Quatermass's Rocket Group. A subplot involving an extramarital affair between her and Briscoe is also left out of the film version. Kneale was particularly aggravated by the dropping from his original teleplay the notion that Carroon has absorbed not only the bodies but also the memories and the personalities of his two fellow astronauts. This change leads to the most significant difference between the two versions: in the television version, Quatermass makes a personal appeal to the last vestiges that remain of the three absorbed astronauts to make the creature commit suicide before it can spore, whereas in the film version Quatermass kills the creature by electrocution. Director Val Guest defended this change believing it was \\"filmically a better end to the story\\". He also felt it unlikely that Brian Donlevy's gruff interpretation of Quatermass would lend itself to talking the creature into submission. Having fallen foul of the censors with some of their earlier films, Hammer had an informal agreement to submit scripts in advance of shooting for comment by the BBFC. When the draft script for The Quatermass Xperiment was submitted, Board Secretary Arthur Watkins replied, \\"I must warn you at this stage that, while we accept this story in principle for the ‚ÄòX‚Äô category, we could not certificate, even in that category, a film treatment in which the horrific element was so exaggerated as to be nauseating and revolting to adult audiences\\". The BBFC were particularly concerned with the violence in the scenes where Carroon escapes from hospital and with how graphic the depiction would be of Caroon's transformation into the alien creature. The script was refined further by director Val Guest, who cut 30 pages from Landau's script. One of Guest's key script contributions was to tailor the dialogue to suit the brusque style of star Brian Donlevy. With an American actor cast as Quatermass, Guest reverted Briscoe to a British character and reinstated Quatermass's title of professor. Guest also adapted some sections of the script in response to the concerns of the BBFC. Further stylistic changes were sought by the BBC, who retained a script approval option after the sale of the rights and asked Nigel Kneale to work on their suggested changes, much to his indignation, . Kneale was tasked with rewriting any scenes featuring BBC announcers to match the BBC's news reporting style. =Casting= Irish-American actor Brian Donlevy was brought in by Robert L. Lippert to play the title role of Quatermass to provide an interest for American audiences. Donlevy, in his own words, specialised in \\"he-men roles ‚Äì rough, tough and realistic\\". Nominated for an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for Beau Geste (1939), he was also known for his appearances in The Great McGinty (1940) and The Glass Key (1942). At the time he appeared as Quatermass, his career was in decline, however. Donlevy's no-nonsense portrayal of Quatermass is very different from that of Reginald Tate in the television version. It was not to Nigel Kneale's liking, who said, \\"I may have picked Quatermass's surname out of a phone book, but his first name was carefully chosen: Bernard, after Bernard Lovell, the creator of Jodrell Bank. Pioneer, ultimate questing man. Donlevy played him as a mechanic, a creature with a completely closed mind\\". Responding to Kneale's criticisms, Val Guest said, \\"Nigel Kneale was expecting to find Quatermass like he was on television, a sensitive British scientist, not some American stomping around, but to me Donlevy gave it absolute reality\\". By this stage in his career, Donlevy was suffering from alcoholism; it was some weeks into the shoot before Guest became aware that the flask of coffee he always carried on set was laced with brandy. Guest found, however, that \\"Brian was all right, no problem at all once you kept him sober\\". He reprised the role of Quatermass in Quatermass 2 (1957) but was replaced by Andrew Keir in the third film, Quatermass and the Pit (1967). Inspector Lomax was played by Jack Warner, who appeared by arrangement with the J. Arthur Rank Organisation, with whom he was contracted. At the time, he was best known as the star of Here Come the Huggetts (1948) and its sequels. Shortly after finishing The Quatermass Xperiment, he made his first appearance on television in the role he is most associated with: the title character in Dixon of Dock Green (1955‚Äì76). Warner plays Lomax in a lighthearted fashion and there is a running joke in the film involving Lomax's futile attempts to find the time to have a shave with his electric razor. Richard Wordsworth was cast by Val Guest as the hapless Victor Carroon because \\"he had the right sort of face for the part\\". He was best known at the time for his work in the theatre. His performance in The Quatermass Xperiment is frequently compared with that of Boris Karloff in Frankenstein (1931).See, for example, ; ; . Guest, aware of the risk of an actor going over the top with the part, directed Wordsworth to \\"hold back just a mite of what you're feeling\\". Summing up Wordsworth's performance, film critic Bill Warren said, \\"All Carroon's anguish and torment are conveyed in one of the best mime performances in horror and science fiction films... A sequence in which he is riding in a car with his wife is uncanny: only the alien is visible for a long moment\\". Wordsworth went on to appear in three more Hammer films: The Camp on Blood Island (1958), The Revenge of Frankenstein (1958), and The Curse of the Werewolf (1961). He remained known predominantly as a stage actor, among other things devising and starring in a one-person show dedicated to his great-great grandfather, the poet William Wordsworth. Another American star provided by Robert L. Lippert was Margia Dean, who played Judith Carroon. A former beauty queen, Dean was allegedly cast on account of her association with the 20th Century Fox president, Spyros Skouras. According to executive producer Michael Carreras, \\"Skouras had a girlfriend who was an actress and he wanted her in pictures, but he didn't want her in pictures in America, because of the tittle-tattle or whatever, so he set it up through his friend Bob Lippert\\". Val Guest recalled of her, \\"She was a sweet girl, but she couldn't act\\". Her American accent was considered out of place in the film, and so her lines were dubbed in post production. Among the other actors that appear in the film are Thora Hird, Gordon Jackson, David King-Wood, Harold Lang, Lionel Jeffries, and Sam Kydd, many of whom appeared regularly in films directed by Val Guest. The Quatermass Xperiment also saw an early role for Jane Asher, who plays the little girl whom Carroon encounters when he is on the run. =Filming= Bray Studios, where many of the interior scenes in The Quatermass Xperiment were filmed. Val Guest was hired to direct the film. He began his career co-writing comedies such as Oh, Mr Porter! (1937) and Ask a Policeman (1939) before moving into directing with Miss London Ltd. (1943). His first directing job for Hammer was on Life with the Lyons (1954) and he went on to direct their first two colour features: The Men of Sherwood Forest (1954) and Break in the Circle (1954). Guest had little interest in science fiction and was unenthusiastic about directing the film; he reluctantly took copies of Nigel Kneale's television scripts with him on holiday in Tangiers and only began reading them after being teased for his \\"ethereal\\" attitude by his wife, Yolande Donlan. Impressed by what he read and pleased to be offered the opportunity to break away from directing comedy films, he took the job. In his approach to directing the film, Guest sought to make \\"a slightly wild story more believable\\" by creating a \\"science fact\\" film, shot \\"as though shooting a special programme for the BBC or something\\". Influenced by Elia Kazan's Panic in the Streets (1950), Guest employed a cin√©ma v√©rit√© style, making extensive use of hand-held camera, even on set, an unusual technique for the time which horrified several of the technicians employed on the film. To inject pace and add further realism into the story, Guest directed his actors to deliver their lines rapid-fire and to overlap the dialogue. A meticulous planner, he created storyboards for every shot and mounted them on a blackboard so as to brief the crew for each day's scenes. As a consequence, some members of the crew found Guest's approach to be too mechanical. Principal photography began on 12 October 1954 with a night shoot at Chessington Zoo and continued from 18 October 1954 into December. The budget was ¬£42,000, low even by the standards of Hammer at the time. Special effects technician Les Bowie recalled, \\"We did Quatermass on a budget so low it wasn't a real budget. I did it for wages not as a proper effects man who gets allocated a certain budget for a movie\\". The shots of the emergency services rushing to the rocket crash site at the beginning of the movie were filmed in the village of Bray, Berkshire, where Hammer's studios were located. The scenes with the crashed rocket were shot in a corn field at Water Oakley, near Bray. It was originally intended to make the crash site look more spectacular by setting fire to the field but bad weather interfered. Guest used a wide-angle lens for these shots to convey a feeling of vastness to the scene. Carroon's encounter with the little girl was filmed at the East India Docks in London. A second unit, under cameraman Len Harris, conducted additional location shooting around London for the montage scenes of the police search for Carroon. For the shot of the lights of London going out when the electricity is diverted to Westminster Abbey, an agreement was made with one of the engineers at Battersea Power Station to turn off the lights illuminating the outside of the station; however the engineer misunderstood and briefly cut all the power along the River Thames. Most of the remaining location shooting was done in the Windsor area. The rest of the film was shot at Hammer's Bray Studios, with the New Stage there housing the sets for the hospital and the interior of Westminster Abbey. Michael Carreras had written to the Abbey seeking permission to film there but was refused. The rooms of Down Place, the former country house Bray Studios were built around, were used for other scenes such as Inspector Lomax's office. Art director James Elder Wills, in his final film for Hammer, made great use of the existing architecture of Down Place to enhance the effectiveness of his sets. =Makeup and special effects= Quatermass (Brian Donlevy) (centre) and Briscoe (David King-Wood) (left) examine Carroon (Richard Wordsworth) (seated) in a scene from The Quatermass Xperiment. Makeup artist Phil Leakey worked with cinematographer Walter J. Harvey to accentuate the shadows around Wordworth's face to give him a skeletal appearance. The work of makeup artist Phil Leakey in transforming Richard Wordsworth's Carroon into the mutating creature was a key contribution to the effectiveness of the film. Val Guest, Anthony Hinds, and Leakey all agreed that the makeup should make Carroon appear pitiful rather than ugly. Leakey placed a light above the actor in the makeup chair and then worked on accentuating the shadows cast by his eyebrows, nose, chin and cheekbones. The makeup was a liquid rubber solution mixed with glycerine to give the impression of sweat. Leakey's job was made easier by Wordsworth's natural high cheekbones and hollow temples and he also worked closely with cinematographer Walter J. Harvey to ensure the lighting in each shot emphasised Wordsworth's features. Leakey also created Carroon's mutating arm. The hand was created from a cast of the hand of an arthritis victim, enlarged and exaggerated by Leakey. The rest of the arm was built up using latex and rubber and, inside, had a series of plastic tubes through which fluid was pumped to give the effect of the arm swelling. A large sponge-rubber prosthetic was used for a brief scene in the zoo showing Carroon's mutation had advanced further. The shrivelled corpses of Carroon's victims, glimpsed from time to time in the film, were also made by Leakey. Les Bowie provided the special effects: he had made his name perfecting an improved technique for matte painting, called the delineating matte, and formed a company with Vic Margutti that specialised in matte effects. Bowie provided a number of matte paintings to enhance the scale of certain key shots in the film, including the crashed rocket, the Westminster Abbey set, and the shot of Quatermass walking away from the Abbey at the climax of the film. Partly because of the concerns raised by the BBFC and partly on account of the low budget, Val Guest kept the creature largely off-screen for much of the film, feeling that audiences' imaginations would fill in the blanks more effectively than he and the special effects team could deliver on-screen. For the climactic scenes at Westminster Abbey, however, Bowie created a monster from tripe and rubber and photographed it against a model of the Abbey. Sparks and fireworks were used for the shots of the creature being electrocuted. Michael Carreras felt something was missing when he viewed the first cut of this scene: he said, \\"There was this great glob of something hanging about on the scaffolding. And they had put in the best music they could and put the best effects on it, but it meant nothing as far as I was concerned ‚Ä¶ absolutely nothing at all\\". An eye was added to the model of the monster and a human scream added to the soundtrack to give the creature some semblance of humanity in its final moments. Models were also used for the rocket blasting off in the film's final shot. =Music= John Hotchkis was originally hired to compose the music but, when he fell ill, Anthony Hinds asked conductor John Hollingsworth to recommend a replacement. Hollingsworth suggested James Bernard, with whom he had worked on a number of BBC radio productions. Bernard sent Hinds a tape of the score of one of these productions, an adaptation of The Duchess of Malfi, and was duly hired. Bernard watched the film a number of times, stopping after each reel to make notes and discuss where the music would be needed. Val Guest was not involved in any of the music sessions; Anthony Hinds supervised Bernard and made the final decisions as to where the music should occur. Bernard composed the music at his piano and then worked out the orchestration, which was performed by the Royal Opera House Orchestra. Hollingsworth restricted the arrangement of the score to just the string and percussion sections: Bernard recalled, \\"I had not written for film before and had only used strings for the BBC scores, so I think that John thought it would be better to see how I got on with these two sections before letting me loose with a full orchestra\\". The score runs to 20 minutes and uses a rising and falling three-note semitone throughout. Bernard's biographer, David Huckvale, argues that Bernard's use of atonal strings to create a sense of menace predates Bernard Herrmann's score for Psycho (1960), which is usually cited as the first film to employ the technique. Remarking on the effectiveness of the score, the film critic John Brosnan said, \\"Of prime importance, is the contribution of the soundtrack, in this case supplied by James Bernard who never wrote a more unnerving, jangly score\\". Bernard went on to become Hammer's most prolific composer, scoring 23 Hammer films between 1955 and 1974. Several cues from The Quatermass Xperiment were released on CD in 1999 by GDI Records on a compilation titled The Quatermass Film Music Collection. Reception =Cinema release= The Quatermass Xperiment had its premi√®re at the London Pavilion on 26 August 1955. As expected, The Quatermass Xperiment received an ‚ÄòX‚Äô Certificate from the BBFC, restricting admission to persons over the age of sixteen. It was only the twelfth film to receive the certificate since its introduction in 1951. Whereas most other studios were nervous of this new certificate, Hammer, who had noticed the success of the similarly ‚ÄòX‚Äô-rated Les Diaboliques (1954), chose to exploit it by dropping the \\"E\\" from \\"Experiment\\" in the title of the film. \\"X is not an unknown quantity\\" was the tagline Exclusive Films used to sell the picture to cinema managers, urging them to \\"Xploit the Xcitement\\" of the film. On subsequent re-releases, the film reverted to the title The Quatermass Experiment. The Quatermass Xperiment premi√®red on 26 August 1955 at the London Pavilion on Piccadilly Circus. The supporting feature was The Eric Winstone Band Show. It performed extremely well during its West End run, taking ¬£3,500 a week at the box office. Timed to coincide with the broadcast of the television sequel, Quatermass II, the film went on general release in the United Kingdom on 20 November 1955 in a double bill with the French film Rififi. This became the most successful double bill release of 1955 in the UK. In some parts of the UK, the Watch Committees of local councils demanded certain scenes, mainly close-up shots of Carroon's victims, be removed before allowing the film to be exhibited in their jurisdictions. In the United States, Robert L. Lippert attempted to interest Columbia Pictures in distributing the film but they felt it would be competition for their own production, It Came From Beneath The Sea, which was on release at the time. Because Quatermass was unknown in the US, Lippert had renamed the film Shock!. Unable to secure a sale, he retitled it again, this time to The Creeping Unknown. United Artists eventually acquired the distribution rights in March 1956 for a fee of $125,000. The Creeping Unknown was packaged in a double bill with a Gothic horror movie called The Black Sleep, starring Basil Rathbone, Lon Chaney, Jr. and Bela Lugosi. Four minutes, mainly of expository material, were cut from the runtime of the film. It opened in US theatres in June 1956 and was so successful that United Artists offered to part-fund a sequel. According to a report in Variety, published on 6 November 1956, a nine-year- old boy died of a ruptured artery at a cinema in Oak Park, Illinois during a showing of this double bill. The Guinness Book of Records subsequently recorded the incident as the only known case of an audience member dying of fright while watching a horror film. =Critical response= The Times newspaper critic gave the film a generally favourable assessment: \\"Mr. Val Guest, the director, certainly knows his business when it comes to providing the more horrid brand of thrills... The first part of this particular film is well up to standard. Mr. Brian Donlevy, as the American scientist responsible for the experiment, is a little brusque in his treatment of British institutions but he is clearly a man who knows what he is doing. Mr. Jack Warner, representing Scotland Yard, is indeed a comfort to have at hand when Things are on the rampage\\". Positive reviews also came from Peter Burnup in the News of the World, who found that \\"with the added benefit of bluff, boisterous Brian Donlevy... all earnest addicts of science fiction will undoubtedly love every minute of it\\", while the reviewer in The Manchester Guardian praised \\"a narrative style that quite neatly combines the horrific and the factual\\". Today's Cinema called it \\"one of the best essays in science fiction to date\\". Film historian Bruce G. Hallenbeck notes a degree of national pride in some of the positive reviews. For instance, Paul Dehn in the News Chronicle said, \\"This is the best and nastiest horror film I have seen since the War. How jolly that it is also British\\"! Similarly, William Whitebait in the New Statesman, who found the film to be \\"better than either War of the Worlds or Them!\\", also called for \\"a couple of cheers for the reassurance that British films can still, once in a while, come quick\\". On a less positive note, Frank Jackson of Reynolds News quipped \\"That TV pseudo- science shocker The Quatermass Xperiment has been filmed and quitermess they've made of it too\\", before slating the film as \\"82 minutes of sick-making twaddle\\". The horror content of the film was mentioned in several reviews: Patrick Gibbs of the Daily Telegraph said the film \\"gives the impression that it originated in the strip of some horror comic. It remains very horrid and not quite coherent\\", while the reviewer in the Daily Mirror found the film to be \\"a real chiller thriller but not for the kids\\" and Dilys Powell of The Sunday Times found the film \\"exciting but distinctly nauseating\\". Another unimpressed critic was Fran√ßois Truffaut, who wrote in Cahiers du cin√©ma that \\"This one is very, very bad, far from the small pleasure we get, for example, from the innocent science fiction films signed by the American Jack Arnold... The subject could have been turned into a good film, not lacking in spice; with a bit of imagination... None of this is in this sadly English film\\". Upon its release in the United States Variety praised the film as an \\"extravagant piece of science fiction. Despite its obvious horror angles, production is crammed with incident and suspense\\". According to Hallenbeck, many US critics found Brian Donlevy's gruff Quatermass a breath of fresh air from the earnest hero scientists of American science fiction films, such as Gene Barry's character in War of the Worlds. Other US trade reviews were mixed. Harrison's Reports felt, \\"the story is, of course, quite fantastic but it has enough horrific ingredients to go over with those who enjoy scary doings\\". Film Bulletin was not impressed. \\"Its strong point is an eerie atmosphere . . . but fails to build the suspense essential in this kind of film . . . Val Guest's direction is heavy with cliches.\\" Among the critics and film historians who have reviewed The Quatermass Xperiment in the years since its release have been John Baxter who said, in Science Fiction in the Cinema (1970), \\"In its time, The Quatermass Experiment was a pioneering sf film... Brian Donlevy was stiff but convincing... Much of the film is saved, however, by Richard Wordsworth... one of the finest such performances since Karloff's triumphs of the Thirties\\". This view was echoed by John Brosnan in The Primal Screen (1991): \\"One of the best of all alien possession movies\\", he wrote, \\"Not since Boris Karloff as Frankenstein's monster has an actor managed to create such a memorable, and sympathetic, monster out of mime alone\\". Bill Warren in Keep Watching The Skies! (1982) found that \\"the buildup is slightly too long and too careful\\" but also said, \\"It's an intelligent, taut and well-directed thriller; it showcases Nigel Kneale's ideas well; it's scary and exciting. It was made by people who cared about what they were doing, who were making entertainment for adults. It is still one of the best alien invasion films\\". Steve Chibnall, writing for the British Film Institute's Screenonline, describes The Quatermass Xperiment as \\"one of the high points of British SF/horror cinema\\". The horror fiction writer Stephen King praised the film in his non-fiction book Danse Macabre (1991) as one of his favourite horror movies between 1950 and 1980 . The film director John Carpenter, who later collaborated with Nigel Kneale on the film Halloween III: Season of the Witch (1982), has claimed that The Quatermass Xperiment \\"had an enormous, enormous impact on me ‚Äì and it continues to be one of my all-time favourite science- fiction movies\\". Legacy The success of The Quatermass Xperiment came at an opportune time for Hammer. By 1955 the deal with Robert L. Lippert had expired and the company produced just one feature film that year, Women Without Men. Many of the independent cinemas that provided the market for Hammer's films in the UK were struggling in the face of competition from television and faced closure. The Quatermass Xperiment gave Hammer a much needed box office hit and was also the first film to bring the company to the attention of a major film distributor, in this case United Artists. From this point onward, Hammer was increasingly able to deal directly with the major distributors and no longer needed intermediaries like Lippert. This ultimately spelt the end for Exclusive Films, Hammer's own distribution company, which was wound down in the late 1950s. Hammer quickly sought to capitalise on its good fortune with a sequel. Staff member Jimmy Sangster pitched a story about a monster emerging from the Earth's core. However, when the company asked Nigel Kneale for permission to use the character of Quatermass, he refused, not wanting to lose control of his creation. Nevertheless, the film went ahead, as X the Unknown (1956), again capitalising on the 'X' Certificate in its title and featuring a newly created scientist character, very much in the Quatermass mould, played by Dean Jagger. Quatermass did eventually return to cinema screens in Quatermass 2 (1957) and Quatermass and the Pit (1967), both of which had screenplays written by Nigel Kneale and based on serials originally written by him and presented by BBC Television. Rival British film companies also tried to cash in with science fiction films of their own, including Satellite in the Sky, The Gamma People and Fire Maidens from Outer Space (all 1956). The Quatermass Xperiment was Hammer's first film to be adapted from a television drama. Market research carried out by the company showed that it was the horror aspect of the film, rather than the science fiction, that most appealed to audiences. Three of the four films Hammer made in 1956 were horror films: X the Unknown, Quatermass 2 and The Curse of Frankenstein. The enormous success of the latter of these cemented Hammer's reputation for horror and the company became synonymous with the genre. Michael Carreras later said, \\"The film that must take all the credit for the whole Hammer series of horror films was really The Quatermass Xperiment\\". Home media The Quatermass Xperiment was released in 2003 by DD Video on Region 2 DVD. It contained a number of extra features including a commentary by director Val Guest and Hammer historian Marcus Hearn, as well as an interview with Val Guest, an original trailer, and a production booklet written by Marcus Hearn and Jonathan Rigby. A Region 1 made-on-demand DVD-R, sourced from a high-definition master, was released in 2011 by MGM. The film had been previously released on VHS cassette and LaserDisc. In other media The film was adapted into a 16-page comic strip published in two parts in the March‚ÄìApril 1977 and June 1977 issues of the magazine The House of Hammer (volume 1, issue #'s 8 and 9, published by General Book Distribution). It was drawn by Brian Lewis from a script by Les Lilley and Ben Aldrich. The cover of issue 9 featured a painting by Lewis of Professor Quatermass.

Miller's primary research focus is the structure and function of cell membranes, especially chloroplast thylakoid membranes. Miller is a co-author of a major introductory college and high school biology textbook published by Prentice Hall since 1990. Miller, who is Roman Catholic, is opposed to creationism, including the intelligent design (ID) movement. He has written three books on the subject: Finding Darwin's God; Only a Theory; and The Human Instinct. Miller has received the Laetare Medal at the University of Notre Dame. In 2017, he received the inaugural St. Albert Award from the Society of Catholic Scientists. Biography Miller graduated from Rahway High School in Rahway, New Jersey, and then received his Sc.B. in biology in 1970 from Brown University. He earned his Ph.D. in biology from the University of Colorado at Boulder in 1974. From 1974 to 1980, he taught at Harvard University.  Research  His research involves problems of structure and function in biological membranes, especially chloroplast thylakoid membranes, often involving electron microscopy. Science advocacy Miller has voiced his support for what he calls \\"pro-science\\" candidates in politics. He has campaigned for school board and education candidates who support the teaching of evolution in Kansas and Ohio. In the science community, he has sought to elevate the understanding of scientists of the roots of the creationist movement, and to encourage the popularization of scientific concepts. Miller has appeared in court as a witness, and on panels debating the teaching of intelligent design in schools. In 2002, the Ohio State Board of Education held a public debate between two scientists, including Miller, and two proponents of intelligent design. He testified for the plaintiffs, but only as a fact witness (not as an expert), in Selman v. Cobb County, testing the legality of stickers calling evolution a \\"theory, not a fact\\" that were placed on the biology textbook Miller authored. In 2005, the judge ruled that the stickers violated the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment to the United States Constitution. This decision was vacated on appeal because of missing records of the previous trial. The case was remanded for additional evidentiary inquiry and new findings, and a list of factual issues that the court would probably want to address included as item 15 a reference to Miller's testimony regarding \\"the colloquial or popular understanding of the term [theory]\\" and the suggested question as to whether he has any qualifications to testify as an expert on the popular meaning of the word \\"theory\\". The case was remanded back to the lower court and was eventually settled out of court.Selman, et al. vs. Cobb County Board of Education , 25 May 2006. Miller was also the plaintiff's lead expert witness in the 2004-2005 Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District case, challenging the school board's mandate to incorporate intelligent design into the curriculum. The judge in that case also ruled decisively in favor of the plaintiffs. He spoke at the Skeptics Society's Origins Conference in October 2008, and at the Veritas Forum on topics such as the relationship between science and religion and the existence of God. Miller has appeared on the Comedy Central television show The Colbert Report, and has made many appearances on C-SPAN debating proponents of creationism and intelligent design. He has debated several supporters of intelligent design including biochemist Michael J. Behe. He gave a Faraday Institute lecture in April 2009 on \\"God, Darwin and Design\\"Darwin Online listing and appeared on the Today Programme arguing, \\"The issue of God is an issue on which reasonable people may differ, but I certainly think that it's an over-statement of our scientific knowledge and understanding to argue that science in general, or evolutionary biology in particular, proves in any way that there is no God.\\"News recap, Today Programme, BBC, 29 April 2009.

Early life Phoenix was born at St Mary's Hospital in Fallowfield, Manchester, to Annie (n√©e Noonan), originally of County Galway, Ireland, and Thomas \\"Tom\\" Manfield. Phoenix claimed that she had also been born in Galway, although she later stated that she was merely agreeing with something her elderly mother had already told the press. When Phoenix was eight years old, her father was involved in a car accident; in court, it was revealed that his marriage was bigamous as he had never divorced his first wife, who was living some miles away and who he had been paying maintenance to for many years. She later described this period in her life as a \\"nightmare\\", saying that \\"I lost my safe, secure, normal world\\". Her mother later married Richard Pilkington. Phoenix attended Fallowfield Central School. As a child, she nursed early theatrical ambitions, appearing regularly on the radio in Children's Hour at the age of 11, after having submitted a monologue. After leaving school, she worked as a filing clerk for the electricity charging department of Manchester Corporation, performing in amateur dramatics in her spare time. She joined the Arts Theatre in Manchester and other Northern repertory companies. Career Phoenix's big break came in 1948, when she played Sandy Powell's wife in the Mancunian Film Studios film Cup-tie Honeymoon, followed by a summer season in Blackpool with Thora Hird in the show Happy Days. Exposure led to more serious work with Joan Littlewood's Theatre Workshop at the Theatre Royal, Stratford East. She also worked as a writer for ventriloquist Terry Hall and comedian Harry Worth. Some undistinguished film work followed in 1958 (Blood of the Vampire and Jack the Ripper) and in 1960, she returned to Manchester with her ambition all but spent. Phoenix's fortunes improved when she was given her best known role as Elsie Tanner, the devil-may-care divorc√©e who lived at No. 11 in Coronation Street. By this time, she had changed her name from Pilkington to Phoenix, after the mythological bird that rose from the ashes. She featured in the programme from 1960 to 1973 and again from 1976 to 1984. In 1972 she was invited to open a brand new speedway track at Ellesmere Port and her character as Elsie Tanner helped to draw a record crowd of around 10,000 to the track at Thornton Road, Ellesmere Port, home of the \\"Gunners\\". Her character became known for her fiery red hair and was described by Prime Minister James Callaghan as \\"the sexiest thing on television\\". During her periods of absence from the series, she failed in her attempts to find suitable alternative roles. She left the series for the final time in January 1984. In the story, her character moved to Portugal to meet up with an old flame until 2004 when the character died in a car crash (off screen). Phoenix's popularity gained her a part in the British film The L-Shaped Room (1962) in which she played a prostitute and which also featured her future husband Antony Booth in a small role. After her final departure from Coronation Street, she appeared in a one- act television play, Hidden Talents, in 1986. At this time, she was suffering from advanced lung cancer; in the play, she played a woman dying of cancer. She also starred in short-lived sitcom Constant Hot Water the same year, playing a Bridlington landlady. She was the subject of This Is Your Life in 1972 when she was surprised by Eamonn Andrews on the set of Coronation Street. In 1985, she was interviewed for a magazine by long-time fan, the singer Morrissey, who also featured her on the cover of one of the Smiths' singles, \\"Shakespeare's Sister\\". Personal life Phoenix's love life was often fodder for tabloid stories. Her first marriage was to actor Peter Marsh, whom she married in Bradford Cathedral in 1953; the marriage lasted only a year, and they were divorced in 1961. On 23 December 1972, she married her Coronation Street co-star Alan Browning. The marriage lasted less than seven years, as Browning had alcohol-related problems and died from liver failure in September 1979.http://www.corrie.net/profiles/actors/phoenix_patricia.html She later married actor Anthony Booth, the father-in-law of former Prime Minister Tony Blair. Phoenix wrote two volumes of autobiography: All My Burning Bridges (1974) and Love, Curiosity, Freckles and Doubt (1983). She was a practising Catholic and a lifelong supporter of the Labour Party, campaigning for Tony Blair at the 1983 general election for him to be elected as the Member of Parliament for Sedgefield which he successfully won. Phoenix also campaigned with Booth for former Minister for Technology Tony Benn at the Chesterfield by-election in 1984, which Benn won. She also owned the Navigation Inn, a pub in Buxworth. Death In March 1986, Phoenix, who smoked 60 cigarettes a day, was diagnosed with lung cancer after collapsing at home. She continued to work following her diagnosis, hiding her illness from most people, including her lover Anthony Booth. In the summer of 1986, her condition deteriorated, forcing her to undergo more extensive treatment and confirming mild speculation in the press that she had health problems. It later leaked that she had just weeks to live and had been given the last rites. Phoenix married Booth in hospital in Stockport on 9 September 1986, attracting much media attention. Eight days later, she died in her sleep, aged 62. At her request, her funeral service at the Holy Name Church in Manchester featured a large brass band; according to Coronation Street histories written by show historian Daran Little, she wanted the event that marked her death to be as lively as her life. Booth's daughter Cherie was amongst the mourners, alongside her husband, Labour MP (and future Prime Minister) Tony Blair. Legacy Since her death, Phoenix has been portrayed by Kym Marsh, Denise Black, Debbie Rush and Sue Johnston (who have all also appeared in Coronation Street as, respectively, Michelle Connor, Denise Osborne, Anna Windass and Gloria Price), Lynda Rooke and Jessie Wallace in various dramas depicting her life, both on stage and television. She is commemorated by a blue plaque outside Granada Studios, the location for most of her work on Coronation Street.

Amport House is a manor house (at ) in the village of Amport, near Andover, Hampshire. It is now a Grade II listed building. History The current house, which was built in an Elizabethan style, was constructed near the village of Amport in 1857 by John Paulet, 14th Marquess of Winchester and replaced two earlier houses built on the site. The last of the Paulet family to reside at Amport was Henry Paulet, 16th Marquess of Winchester, who (facing high levels of taxation at the end of the First World War) sold the estate in lots between November 1918 and July 1919. Not long afterwards the house was purchased by Colonel Sofer Whitburn DSO, who in 1923 engaged Sir Edwin Lutyens and Gertrude Jekyll to redesign the gardens. At the start of the Second World War, the house was requisitioned to be used as the headquarters of Royal Air Force Maintenance Command; as well as ceding them use of the house, Sofer Whitburn is said to have donated his entire wine cellar to the Officers' Mess as a patriotic gesture. He sold the house in 1943 (with the RAF still in possession); ultimately the RAF itself bought the property in 1957. Later that year the Royal Air Force Chaplains' School moved from Dowdeswell Court in Dowdeswell to Amport House. The School, which had included a Royal Navy chaplain staff member, became the tri-service Armed Forces Chaplaincy Centre in 1996 on the closure of the depot of the Royal Army Chaplains' Department at Bagshot Park. A converted stable block of the house no longer holds the Museum of Army Chaplaincy; the museum is moving to a new site at Beckett Lodge, Shrivenham, near Swindon and is due to open in late 2020. There is also a gatehouse and a pleached avenue of lime trees, believed to be the longest such avenue in the United Kingdom.  Closure  In September 2016 it was announced that Amport House would be put up for sale by the Ministry of Defence as part of a programme of defence estate rationalisation. A Better Defence Estate, published in November 2016, indicates that the site would close by 2020, which it subsequently did and was relocated to Shrivenham. The licence for the publication of banns of marriage and the solemnisation of such marriages which had been granted to the chapel in January 2000 in accordance with the Marriage Act 1949 was cancelled in July 2020.

He was born into an Ulster aristocratic family at St James's, Westminster, and served for less than a year as a representative in the Irish House of Commons for Carrickfergus before succeeding his father as second Marquess of Donegall in 1799. Lord Donegall was admitted to the Irish Privy Council in 1803 and later served as Lord Lieutenant of County Donegal from 1831 until his death. He was also made a Knight of the Order of St Patrick in 1821 on the occasion of King George IV's visit to Ireland A lifelong gambler, Lord Donegall married the daughter of Edward May, a moneylender and owner of a gambling house. This may have been an agreement to resolve some debts. In 1818 it came to light that Anna May was illegitimate and had been under age when she married. The result of a 1753 law meant that the marriage was invalid which would have disinherited the children from the titles. Proceedings were put in place to resolve the situation but it was the changing of the marriage act in 1822 which allowed the eldest son to retain his place in the inheritance. Lord Donegall died heavily in debt in 1844 at his home at Ormeau, County Down (which formed the basis of Ormeau Park), and was buried in St Nicholas's Church, Carrickfergus.

Telematics can involve any of the following: Lexus Gen V navigation system * the technology of sending, receiving and storing information using telecommunication devices to control remote objects * the integrated use of telecommunications and informatics for application in vehicles and to control vehicles on the move * global navigation satellite system technology integrated with computers and mobile communications technology in automotive navigation systems * (most narrowly) the use of such systems within road vehicles, also called vehicle telematics  History  Telematics is a translation of the French word t√©l√©matique which was first coined by Simon Nora and Alain Minc in a 1978 report to the French government on the computerization of society. It referred to the transfer of information over telecommunications and was a portmanteau blending the French words t√©l√©communications (\\"telecommunications\\") and informatique (\\"computing science\\"). The original broad meaning of telematics continues to be used in academic fields but in commerce it now generally means vehicle telematics.  Vehicle telematics  Telematics ‚Äî # The convergence of telecommunications and information processing, the term later evolved to refer to automation in automobiles, such as the invention of the emergency warning system for vehicles. GPS navigation, integrated hands-free cell phones, wireless safety communications and automatic driving assistance systems all are covered under the telematics umbrella. # The science of telecommunications and informatics applied in wireless technologies and computational systems. 802.11p, the IEEE standard in the 802.11 family and also referred to as Wireless Access for the Vehicular Environment (WAVE), is the primary standard that addresses and enhances Intelligent Transport System.  Practical applications of vehicle telematics  Share bicycle with solar powered electronics to track and account for its usage Vehicle telematics can help improve the efficiency of an organization. Practical applications include: = Vehicle tracking = Vehicle tracking is monitoring the location, movements, status and behaviour of a vehicle or fleet of vehicles. This is achieved through a combination of a GPS (GNSS) receiver and an electronic device (usually comprising a GSM GPRS modem or SMS sender) installed in each vehicle, communicating with the user (dispatching, emergency or co-ordinating unit) and PC-based or web-based software. The data is turned into information by management reporting tools in conjunction with a visual display on computerised mapping software. Vehicle tracking systems may also use odometry or dead reckoning as an alternative or complementary means of navigation. GPS tracking is usually accurate to around 10‚Äì20 metres, but the European Space Agency has developed the EGNOS technology to provide accuracy to 1.5 metres. = Trailer tracking = Trailer tracking is tracking the movements and position of an articulated vehicle's trailer unit, through the use of a location unit fitted to the trailer and a method of returning the position data via mobile communication network, IOT (Internet of things) or geostationary satellite communications, for use through either PC- or web-based software. Cold-store freight trailers that deliver fresh or frozen foods are increasingly incorporating telematics to gather time-series data on the temperature inside the cargo container, both to trigger alarms and record an audit trail for business purposes. An increasingly sophisticated array of sensors, many incorporating RFID technology, is being used to ensure the cold chain. = Container tracking = Freight containers can be tracked by GPS using a similar approach to that used for trailer tracking i.e. a battery-powered GPS device communicating its position via mobile phone or satellite communications. Benefits of this approach include increased security and the possibility to reschedule the container transport movements based on accurate information about its location. According to Berg Insight the installed base of tracking units in the intermodal shipping container segment reached 190,000 at the end of 2013. Growing at a compound annual growth rate of 38.2 percent, the installed base will reach 960,000 units at the end of 2018. = Fleet management = Fleet management is the management of a company's fleet. Fleet management includes the management of ships and or motor vehicles such as cars, vans and trucks. Fleet (vehicle) Management can include a range of functions, such as vehicle financing, vehicle maintenance, vehicle telematics (tracking and diagnostics), driver management, fuel management, health and safety management and dynamic vehicle scheduling. Fleet Management is a function which allows companies that rely on transport in their business to remove or minimize the risks associated with vehicle investment, improving efficiency, productivity and reducing their overall transport costs, providing 100% compliance with government legislation and Duty of Care obligations. These functions can either be dealt with by an in- house Fleet Management department or an outsourced Fleet Management provider. = Telematics Standards = The Association of Equipment Management Professionals (AEMP) developed the industry's first telematics standard. In 2008, AEMP brought together the major construction equipment manufacturers and telematics providers in the heavy equipment industry to discuss the development of the industry's first telematics standard. Following agreement from Caterpillar, Volvo CE, Komatsu, and John Deere Construction & Forestry to support such a standard, the AEMP formed a standards development subcommittee, chaired by Pat Crail CEM, to develop the standard. This committee consisted of developers provided by the Caterpillar/Trimble joint venture known as Virtual Site Solutions, Volvo CE, and John Deere. This group worked from February 2009 through September 2010 to develop the industry's first standard for the delivery of telematics data. The result, the AEMP Telematics Data Standard V1.1 was released in 2010 and officially went live on October 1, 2010. As of November 1, 2010, Caterpillar, Volvo CE, John Deere Construction & Forestry, OEM Data Delivery, and Navman Wireless are able to support customers with delivery of basic telematics data in a standard xml format. Komatsu, Topcon, and others are finishing beta testing and have indicated that they will be able to support customers before the end of 2010. The AEMP's telematics data standard was developed to allow end users to integrate key telematics data (operating hours, location, fuel consumed, and odometer reading where applicable) into their existing fleet management reporting systems. As such, the standard was primarily intended to facilitate importation of these data elements into enterprise software systems such as those used by many medium to large construction contractors. Prior to the standard, end users had few options for integrating this data into their reporting systems in a mixed- fleet environment consisting of multiple brands of machines and a mix of telematics-equipped machines and legacy machines (those without telematics devices where operating data is still reported manually via pen and paper). One option available to machine owners was to visit multiple websites to manually retrieve data from each manufacturer's telematics interface and then manually enter it into their fleet management program's database. This option was cumbersome and labor-intensive. A second option was for the end user to develop an API (Application Programming Interface), or program, to integrate the data from each telematics provider into his or her database. This option was quite costly, as each telematics provider had a different procedure for accessing and retrieving the data and the data format varied from provider to provider. This option automated the process, but because each provider required a unique, custom API to retrieve and parse the data, it was an expensive option. In addition, another API had to be developed any time another brand of machine or telematics device was added to the fleet. A third option for mixed-fleet integration was to replace the various factory- installed telematics devices with devices from a third party telematics provider. Although this solved the problem of having multiple data providers requiring unique integration methods, this was by far the most expensive option. In addition to the expense, many of the third-party devices available for construction equipment are unable to access data directly from the machine's electronic control modules (ECMs), or computers, and as such are more limited than the device installed by the OEM (Cat, Volvo, Deere, Komatsu, etc.) in the data they are able to provide. In some cases, these devices are limited to location and engine run time, although they are increasingly able to accommodate a number of add-on sensors to provide additional data. The AEMP Telematics Data Standard provides a fourth option. By concentrating on the key data elements that drive the majority of fleet management reports (hours, miles, location, fuel consumption), making those data elements available in a standardized xml format, and standardizing the means by which the document is retrieved, the standard allows the end user to use one API to retrieve data from any participating telematics provider. Because one API can retrieve data from any participating telematics provider, as opposed to the unique API for each provider that was required previously, integration development costs are greatly reduced. The current draft version of the AEMP Telematics Data Standard is now called the AEM/AEMP Draft Telematics API Standard which expands the original standard, Version 1.2 to include 19 data fields (with fault code capability). This new draft standard is a collaborative effort of AEMP and the Association of Equipment Manufacturers (AEM), working on behalf of their members and the industry. This Draft API replaces the current version 1.2. The Draft API does not currently cover some types of equipment, e.g., agriculture equipment, cranes, mobile elevating work platforms, air compressors and other niche products. In addition to the new data fields, the AEM/AEMP Draft Telematics API (Application Programming Interface) Standard also changes how the data is accessed in an effort to make it easier to consume and integrate with other systems and processes. It includes standardized communication protocols for the ability to transfer telematics information in mixed equipment fleets to end user business enterprise systems, enabling the end user to employ their own business software to collect and then analyze asset data from mixed equipment fleets without the need to work across multiple telematics provider applications. To achieve a globally recognized standard for conformity worldwide, the AEM/AEMP Draft Telematics API Standard will be submitted for acceptance by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO). Final language is dependent upon completion of the ISO acceptance process. = Satellite navigation = Satellite navigation in the context of vehicle telematics is the technology of using a GPS and electronic mapping tool to enable the driver of a vehicle to locate a position, plan a route and navigate a journey. = Mobile data = Mobile data is the use of wireless data communications using radio waves to send and receive real time computer data to, from and between devices used by field based personnel. These devices can be fitted solely for use while in the vehicle (Fixed Data Terminal) or for use in and out of the vehicle (Mobile Data Terminal). See mobile Internet. The common methods for mobile data communication for telematics was based on private vendors RF communication infrastructure. During the early 2000, manufacturers of mobile data terminals/AVL devices, moved to try cellular data communication in order to offer cheaper ways to transmit telematics information and wider range based on the country full coverage of cellular providers. Ever since then, thanks to the cellular providers that offered low GPRS (2.5G) and later UMTS (3G) rates, mobile data is almost totally offered to telematics customers by cellular communication. = Wireless vehicle safety communications = Wireless vehicle safety communications telematics aid in car safety and road safety. It is an electronic sub-system in a car or other vehicle for the purpose of exchanging safety information, about such things as road hazards and the locations and speeds of vehicles, over short range radio links. This may involve temporary ad hoc wireless local area networks. Wireless units will be installed in vehicles and probably also in fixed locations such as near traffic signals and emergency call boxes along the road. Sensors in the cars and at the fixed locations, as well as possible connections to wider networks, will provide the information, which will be displayed to the drivers in some way. The range of the radio links can be extended by forwarding messages along multi-hop paths. Even without fixed units, information about fixed hazards can be maintained by moving vehicles by passing it backwards. It also seems possible for traffic lights, which one can expect to become smarter, to use this information to reduce the chance of collisions. Further in the future, it may connect directly to the adaptive cruise control or other vehicle control aids. Cars and trucks with the wireless system connected to their brakes may move in convoys, to save fuel and space on the roads. When any column member slows down, all those behind it will automatically slow also. There are also possibilities that need less engineering effort. A radio beacon could be connected to the brake light, for example. Network ideas were scheduled for test in fall 2008, in Europe where radio frequency bandwidth has been allocated. The 30 MHz allocated is at 5.9 GHz, and unallocated bandwidth at 5.4 GHz may also be used. The standard is IEEE 802.11p, a low-latency form of the Wi-Fi local area network standard. Similar efforts are underway in Japan and the USA.\\"Car Talk\\", IEEE Spectrum, October 2008, p. 16 =Emergency warning system for vehicles= Telematics technologies are self-orientating open network architecture structures of variable programmable intelligent beacons developed for application in the development of intelligent vehicles, with the intent to accord (blend, or mesh) warning information with surrounding vehicles in the vicinity of travel, intra-vehicle, and infrastructure. Emergency warning systems for vehicles telematics are developed particularly for international harmonization and standardization of vehicle-to-vehicle, infrastructure-to-vehicle, and vehicle-to-infrastructure real-time Dedicated Short Range Communication (DSRC) systems. Telematics most commonly relate to computerized systems that update information at the same rate as they receive data, enabling them to direct or control a process such as an instantaneous autonomous warning notification in a remote machine or group of machines. By use of telematics as applied to intelligent vehicle technologies, instantaneous direction travel cognizance of a vehicle may be transmitted in real-time to surrounding vehicles traveling in the local area of vehicles equipped (with EWSV) to receive said warning signals of danger. =Intelligent vehicle technologies= Telematics comprise electronic, electromechanical, and electromagnetic devices ‚Äî usually silicon micromachined components operating in conjunction with computer controlled devices and radio transceivers to provide precision repeatability functions (such as in robotics artificial intelligence systems) emergency warning validation performance reconstruction. Intelligent vehicle technologies commonly apply to car safety systems and self-contained autonomous electromechanical sensors generating warnings that can be transmitted within a specified targeted area of interest, say within 100 meters of the emergency warning system for vehicles transceiver. In ground applications, intelligent vehicle technologies are utilized for safety and commercial communications between vehicles or between a vehicle and a sensor along the road. On November 3, 2009 the most advanced Intelligent Vehicle concept car was demonstrated in New York City. A 2010 Toyota Prius became the first LTE connected car. The demonstration was provided by the NG Connect project, a collaboration of automotive telematic technologies designed to exploit in-car 4G wireless network connectivity. =Carsharing= Telematics technology has allowed carsharing services to emerge, such as Local Motion, Uber, Lyft, Car2Go, Zipcar worldwide or City Car Club in the UK. Telematics-enabled computers allow organizers to track members' usage and bill them on a pay-as-you-drive basis. Some systems show users where to find an idle vehicle.Gizmag Sharing system Car Clubs such as Australia's Charter Drive use telematics to monitor and report on vehicle use within pre-defined geofence areas, in order to demonstrate the reach of their transit media car club fleet. =Auto insurance / Usage-based insurance (UBI)= The basic idea of telematics auto insurance is that a driver's behavior is monitored directly while the person drives and this information is transmitted to an insurance company. The insurance company then assesses the risk of that driver having an accident and charges insurance premiums accordingly. A driver who drives less responsibly, will be charged a higher premium than a driver who drives smoothly and with less calculated risk of claim propensity. Other benefits can be delivered to end users with Telematics2.0 based telematics as customer engagement can be enhanced with direct customer interaction. Telematics auto insurance was independently invented and patentedNowotarski, Mark, \\"Progressive Builds a Fortress of Patent Protection\\", Insurance IP Bulletin, October 15, 2004 by a major U.S. auto insurance company, Progressive Auto Insurance and a Spanish independent inventor, Salvador Minguijon Perez (European Patent EP0700009B1). The Perez patents cover monitoring the car's engine control computer to determine distance driven, speed, time of day, braking force, etc. Ironically, Progressive is developing the Perez technology in the US and European auto insurer Norwich Union is developing the Progressive technology for Europe. Both patents have now since been overturned in courts due to prior work in the commercial insurance sectors. According to ABI Research global insurance telematics subscriptions could exceed 107 million in 2018, up from 5.5 million at the end of 2013.Global Insurance Telematics Subscriptions to Exceed 100 million by 2018, but Auto Insurance Faces Dramatic Changes, ABI Research PTOLEMUS estimates UBI will represent more than 100 million telematics policies generating in excess of ‚Ç¨50 billion in premiums globally by 2020. Trials conducted by Norwich Union in 2005 have found that young drivers (18- to 23-year-olds) signing up for telematics auto insurance have had a 20% lower accident rate than average. Theoretical economic research in 2007 on the social welfare effects of Progressive's telematics technology business process patents have questioned whether the business process patents are pareto efficient for society. Preliminary results suggest that it is not, but more work is needed. The progressive patents have been overturned in the US Legal system Apr 2014 on grounds of lack of originality. The smartphone as the in- vehicle device for insurance telematics has been discussed in great detailHandel, P.; Skog, I.; Wahlstrom, J.; Bonawiede, F.; Welch, R.; Ohlsson, J.; Ohlsson, M., \\"Insurance Telematics: Opportunities and Challenges with the Smartphone Solution,\\" Intelligent Transportation Systems Magazine, IEEE , vol.6, no.4, pp.57,70, winter 2014 URL: and the instruments are available for the design of smartphone-driven insurance telematics.

G. Ballard, published in 1966.http://www.jgballard.ca/criticism/crystal_world_perry- wilkie.html  Overview  The novel tells the story of a physician trying to make his way deep into the jungle to a secluded leprosy treatment facility. While trying to make it to his destination, his chaotic path leads him to try to come to terms with an apocalyptic phenomenon in the jungle that crystallises everything it touches. Ballard previously used the theme of apocalyptic crystallisation in the 1964 short story \\"The Illuminated Man\\" (included in The Terminal Beach), which is also set in the same locations.  Plot summary  Cover of 1967 Berkley Books paperback edition. The protagonist is Edward Sanders, an English medical doctor, who arrives to the river port of Port Matarre, in Cameroon. From here he tries to reach a leprosy treatment facility where his friends, Max and Suzanne Clair, live. Soon, however, he starts to recognize that a mysterious phenomenon is crystallizing the jungle along with its living creatures. The same phenomenon is reported to be present also in the Florida everglades and in the Pripyat Marshes (Soviet Union) as well. Scientific explanations of the phenomenon are provided within the book: however, Ballard offers mostly an interior and psychological perspective about it, directly through Sanders' experiences. Several facts, furthermore, remain unexplained: for example, the ability of jewels to liquefy the crystals. The crystals also have the property to keep objects and beings in a suspended state of existence. Many passages deal with this characteristic, pointing out its capability to stop time and life. In his route towards the deep of the forest, Sanders gets involved in a personal feud between Ventress, a Belgian architect, and Thorensen, the director of a diamond mine. In one of the most striking episodes of the novel, Sanders discovers the reason of the deadly rivalry to be Ventress' former wife, Serena, who is terminally ill with tuberculosis. After a final confrontation, Thorensen decides to remain in his house within the jungle, in spite of the encroaching crystallization process. Two of the other characters met by Sanders in his voyage spontaneously make the same decision: Balthus, an apostate priest, and Suzanne. The latter, nearly gone mad and sporting the first symptoms of leprosy, is portrayed towards the end of the novel as the leader of a band of lepers who set for the interior of the crystallizing forest, clearly to never come back. After having barely escaped from the now quickly spreading crystallization, Sanders reaches Port Matarre. Here, however, he makes the same decision as Balthus and Suzanne. In the final pages, Sanders goes back to the river to face the same fate as Suzanne. Reception Richard A. Lupoff described The Crystal World as the best of Ballard's \\"catastrophe novels,\\" saying it was \\"Idiosyncratic but highly effective [and] a very important science fiction book.\\"\\"Lupoff's Book Week\\", Algol 28, 1977, p.56.

It was the home of No. 2 and No. 81 Signal Units, which dealt with high frequency radio communications. Day-to-day operations were overseen (parented in RAF speak) by RAF Brize Norton due to the larger base's proximity to Bampton Castle and that Brize was the home of No. 38 Group Tactical Communications Wing (and successors until 2006).

The XDK includes libraries, a compiler, and various tools used to create software for the Xbox. The XDK has the option to integrate itself into Microsoft Visual Studio 2002 or 2003. This is needed if one wants to develop applications or games for the Xbox. The XDK also includes a tool to record in-game footage, which has been widely used to create high-quality screenshots and trailers.  Purpose  The XDK allows software creators to create, run and distribute applications on the Xbox platform. Xbox 360 XDK's were issues in XDK's (Fat and Slim development kits), XNA Kits (Development kits used for XNA development), Stress Kits (Used to test the power of the Xbox 360 and issued to Microsoft developers only), and Demo kits (Used to demo games) All Devkits include a sidecar which was used to emulate the DVD drive and act as a hard drive. Bundled with XDK's is a windows application called Xbox Neighborhood used to connect to your console, enable memory editing, and integrate to Visual Studio 2010 for Xbox 360 XeX game development. Xbox development environment The Xbox BIOS is based on the NT 5.0 kernel, but does not have all of the resources or capabilities of the Windows 2000 operating system, (for example: neither DirectShow, registry, or DLL are natively supported on the Xbox). Because of the constraints on the hardware and environment of the Xbox, all software development for the Xbox (and all video game consoles systems in general) are focused on reserving the limited resources that exist, the main limitation of which is the amount of available RAM. =Compiling games and applications for the Xbox= *The Xbox Software Development Kit (SDK) (with libraries) is required to compile video games and applications for the Xbox. Review of XBMC in Hardcore Gamer Magazine Also required to compile (and program in) is Microsoft Visual Studio .NET. Xbox embedded operating system *The Xbox does not have an operating system per se, instead it only has a simple BIOS. **Everything else must go into the main executable and its (XDK and own-made) libraries. *Only a single process (executable program) can run at a time on the Xbox. *Xbox hard drive file system (FATX) has many limitations, among them a maximum file name length of 42 characters. *The Xbox has four non-standard USB ports but the Xbox SDK does not contain a full USB stack, thus to add support for USB hardware devices, the developer would have to code the entire USB stack from scratch. XDK and Xbox specific software limitations This is a list of XDK, Xbox hardware, and Xbox operating system specific limitations. *UDF (Universal Disk Format) file system limitation: The Xbox only supports UDF version 1.02 (designed for DVD- Video), which has a maximum file size of 1 GB (a DVD in a newer UDF version with a video that is larger than 1GB will not play), with the same applying to UDF/ISO hybrid formats (a.k.a. UDF Bridge format). A workaround is to burn discs in the ISO 9660 format. The ISO 9660 format has a 2GB (Gigabyte) maximum file size, which cannot be bypassed. *The Xbox hard disk is formatted in FATX (File Allocation Table for Xbox) which has a 4GB (4096 Megabyte) maximum file size, and only supports file/folder names up to 42 characters, a maximum of 255 character full path, and a maximum number of 4096 files/folders in a single folder, plus in the root of each partition, the maximum number of files/folders is 256. FATX also does not support all standard ASCII characters in file/folder names (for example < > = ? : ; \\" * +, / \\\\¬§ &). *The USB flash drive reader/writer class used by the Xbox operating system has a few limitations as well. It is limited to USB flash drives and hard disks compatible with USB Mass Storage Device Class following the USB 1.1 standard, with a maximum size of 4 GB. It can read and write to FATX formatted flash drives, but can only read FAT12, FAT16 (including VFAT), and FAT32. NTFS formatted drives are not supported yet. *With its 733 MHz Intel Pentium III- like CPU and 64MB shared memory, the Xbox has neither a fast enough CPU nor sufficient RAM to play HDTV videos encoded in native 720p/1080i resolution.

In 2005, after nine years of operation, AMANDA officially became part of its successor project, the IceCube Neutrino Observatory. AMANDA consists of optical modules, each containing one photomultiplier tube, sunk in Antarctic ice cap at a depth of about 1500 to 1900 metres. In its latest development stage, known as AMANDA-II, AMANDA is made up of an array of 677 optical modules mounted on 19 separate strings that are spread out in a rough circle with a diameter of 200 metres. Each string has several dozen modules, and was put in place by \\"drilling\\" a hole in the ice using a hot-water hose, sinking the cable with attached optical modules in, and then letting the ice freeze around it. Diagram from the related precursor Project DUMAND illustrating the strings of sensors and detail of one of the sensors AMANDA detects very high energy neutrinos (50+ GeV) which pass through the Earth from the northern hemisphere and then react just as they are leaving upwards through the Antarctic ice. The neutrino interacts with nuclei of oxygen or hydrogen atoms contained in the surrounding water ice through the weak nuclear force, producing a muon and a hadronic shower. The optical modules detect the Cherenkov radiation from these latter particles, and by analysis of the timing of photon hits can approximately determine the direction of the original neutrino with a spatial resolution of approximately 2 degrees. AMANDA's goal was an attempt at neutrino astronomy, identifying and characterizing extra-solar sources of neutrinos. Compared to underground detectors like Super-Kamiokande in Japan, AMANDA was capable of looking at higher energy neutrinos because it is not limited in volume to a manmade tank; however, it had much less accuracy because of the less controlled conditions and wider spacing of photomultipliers. Super-Kamiokande can look at much greater detail at neutrinos from the Sun and those generated in the Earth's atmosphere; however, at higher energies, the spectrum should include neutrinos dominated by those from sources outside the solar system. Such a new view into the cosmos could give important clues in the search for Dark Matter and other astrophysical phenomena. After two years of integrated operation as part of IceCube, the AMANDA counting house (in the Martin A. Pomerantz Observatory) was decommissioned in July and August 2009.

The process of learning these skills is called socialization. Lack of such skills can cause social awkwardness. Interpersonal skills are the acts a person uses to interact with, and relate to, others; they are related to the categories of dominance vs. submission, love vs. hate, affiliation vs. aggression, and control vs. autonomy (Leary, 1957). Positive interpersonal skills include persuasion, active listening, delegation, and stewardship, among others. Social psychology is the academic discipline that does research related to social skills and studies how skills are learned by an individual through changes in attitude, thinking, and behavior. Enumeration and categorization Social skills are the tools that enable people to communicate, learn, ask for help, get needs met in appropriate ways, get along with others, make friends, develop healthy relationships, protect themselves, and in general, be able to interact with the society harmoniously. Social skills build essential character traits like trustworthiness, respectfulness, responsibility, fairness, caring, and citizenship. These traits help build an internal moral compass, allowing individuals to make good choices in thinking and behavior, resulting in social competence. The important social skills identified by the Employment and Training Administration are: * Coordination ‚Äì Adjusting actions in relation to others' actions. * Mentoring ‚Äì Teaching and helping others how to do something (e.g. a study partner). * Negotiation ‚Äì Discussion aimed at reaching an agreement. * Persuasion ‚Äì The action or fact of persuading someone or of being persuaded to do or believe something. * Service Orientation ‚Äì Actively looking for ways to evolve compassionately and grow psycho-socially with people. * Social Perceptiveness ‚Äì Being aware of others' reactions and able to respond in an understanding manner. Social skills are goal oriented with both main goals and sub-goals. For example, a workplace interaction initiated by a new employee with a senior employee will first contain a main goal. This will be to gather information, and then the sub-goal will be to establish a rapport in order to obtain the main goal. Takeo Doi in his study of consciousness distinguished this as tatemae, meaning conventions and verbal expressions and honne, meaning true motive behind the conventions. Causes of deficits Deficits in social skills were categorized by Gresham in 1998, as failure to recognize and reflect social skills, a failure to model appropriate models, and failure to perform acceptable behavior in particular situations in relation to developmental and transitional stages.Teaching Social Skills to Youth, p. 7 Social skill deficits are also a discouragement for children with behavioral challenges when it comes to adult adjustment. =Alcohol misuse= Social skills are often significantly impaired in people suffering from alcoholism. This is due to the neurotoxic long-term effects of alcohol misuse on the brain, especially the prefrontal cortex area of the brain. The social skills that are typically impaired by alcohol abuse, include impairments in perceiving facial emotions, prosody perception problems, and theory of mind deficits. The ability to understand humor is also often impaired in alcohol abusers. Impairments in social skills can also occur in individuals who suffer from fetal alcohol spectrum disorders. These deficits persist throughout the affected people's lives, and may worsen over time due to the effects of aging on the brain. =ADHD and hyperkinetic disorder= People with ADHD and hyperkinetic disorder often have difficulties with social skills, such as social interaction. Approximately half of ADHD children and adolescents will experience peer rejection, compared to 10‚Äì15 percent of non-ADHD youth. Adolescents with ADHD are less likely to develop close friendships and romantic relationships; they are usually regarded by their peers as immature or as social outcasts, with an exception for peers that have ADHD or related disorders themselves, or a high level of tolerance for such symptoms. As they begin to mature, however, it becomes easier to make such relationships. Training in social skills, behavioral modification, and medication have some beneficial effects. It is important for ADHD youth to form friendships with people who are not involved in deviant/delinquent activities and/or significant mental illness/developmental disabilities in order to reduce emergence of later psychopathology. Poor peer relationships can contribute to major depression, criminality, school failure, and substance use disorders. =Autism= People with autistic spectrum disorders including autism and Asperger syndrome are often deficient in social skills. The concept of social skills has been questioned in terms of the autistic spectrum.Raymond G. Romanczyk, Sara White, and Jennifer M. Gillis (2005): Social Skills Versus Skilled Social Behavior: A Problematic Distinction in Autism Spectrum Disorders. Journal of Early and Intensive Behavior Intervention 2 (3), pp. 177‚Äì94 In response for the needs of children with autism, Romanczyk has suggested for adapting comprehensive model of social acquisitions with behavioral modification rather than specific responses tailored for social contexts. =Anxiety and depression= Individuals with few opportunities to socialize with others often struggle with social skills. This can often create a downward spiral effect for people with mental illnesses like anxiety or depression. Due to anxiety experienced from concerns with interpersonal evaluation and fear of negative reaction by others, surfeit expectations of failure or social rejection in socialization leads to avoiding or shutting down from social interactions. Individuals who experience significant levels of social anxiety often struggle when communicating with others, and may have impaired abilities to demonstrate social cues and behaviors appropriately. The use of social media can also cause anxiety and depression. Internet is causing many problems, according to a study from the National library of Medicine, National institute of health, with a sample size of 3560 students. Problematic internet use may be present in about 4% of high school students in the United States, it may be associated with depression. About one third of respondents (28.51%) reported spending fifteen or more hours per week on the internet. Although other studies show positive effects from internet use. Liu, Timothy C et al. ‚ÄúProblematic Internet use and health in adolescents: data from a high school survey in Connecticut‚Äù Journal of clinical psychiatry vol. 72,6 (2011): 836-45. Depression can also cause people to avoid opportunities to socialize, which impairs their social skills, and makes socialization unattractive. = Anti-social behaviors = The authors of the book Snakes in Suits: When Psychopaths Go to Work explore psychopathy in workplace. The FBI consultants describe a five phase model of how a typical psychopath climbs to and maintains power. Many traits exhibited by these individuals include: superficial charm, insincerity, egocentricity, manipulativeness, grandiosity, lack of empathy, low on agreeableness, exploitativeness, independence, rigidity, stubbornness and dictatorial tendencies. Babiak and Hare say for corporate psychopaths, success is defined as the best revenge and their problem behaviors are repeated \\"ad infinitum\\" due to little insight and their proto-emotions such as \\"anger, frustration, and rage\\" is refracted as irresistible charm. The authors note that lack of emotional literacy and moral conscience is often confused with toughness, the ability to make hard decisions, and effective crisis management. Babiak and Hare also emphasizes a reality they identified with psychopaths from studies that psychopaths are not able to be influenced by any sort of therapy.Baibak, P; Hare, R. D Snakes in Suits: When Psychopaths Go to Work (2007) At the University at Buffalo in New York, Emily Grijalva has investigated narcissism in business; she found there are two forms of narcissism: \\"vulnerable\\" and \\"grandiose\\". It is her finding that \\"moderate\\" level of grandiose narcissism is linked to becoming an effective manager. Grandiose narcissists are characterized as confident; they possess unshakable belief that they are superior, even when it's unwarranted. They can be charming, pompous show-offs, and can also be selfish, exploitative and entitled.Emily Grijalva, Gender Differences in Narcissism: A Meta-Analytic Review, Psychological Bulletin, December 2014. Jens Lange and Jan Crusius at the University of Cologne, Germany associates \\"malicious-benign\\" envy within narcissistic social climbers in workplace. It is their finding that grandiose narcissists are less prone to low self-esteem and neuroticism and are less susceptible to the anxiety and depression that can affect vulnerable narcissists when coupled with envy. They characterize vulnerable narcissists as those who \\"believe they are special, and want to be seen that way‚Äìbut are just not that competent, or charming.\\" As a result, their self-esteem fluctuates a lot. They tend to be self-conscious and passive, but also prone to outbursts of potentially violent aggression if their inflated self-image is threatened.\\" Richard Boyatzis says this is an unproductive form of expression of emotions that the person can‚Äôt share constructively, which reflects lack of appropriate skills.HBR's 10 Must Reads on Collaboration Eddie Brummelman, a social and behavioral scientist at the University of Amsterdam in the Netherlands and Brad Bushman at Ohio State University in Columbus says studies show that in western culture narcissism is on the rise from shifting focus on the self rather than on relationships and concludes all narcissism to be socially undesirable (\\"unhealthy feelings of superiority\\"). David Kealy at the University of British Columbia in Canada states that narcissism might aid temporarily but in the long run it is better to be true to oneself, have personal integrity, and be kind to others.New Scientist Magazine, 9 July 2016 Management =Behavior therapy= To behaviorists, social skills are learned behaviors that allow people to achieve social reinforcement. According to Schneider & Byrne (1985), who conducted a meta-analysis of social skills training procedures (51 studies), operant conditioning procedures for training social skills had the largest effect size, followed by modeling, coaching, and social cognitive techniques.Schneider, B.H. & Byrne, B.M.

The rationale for this type of approach to treatment is that people meet a variety of social problems and can reduce the stress and punishment from the encounter in a safe environment. It also addresses how they can increase reinforcement by having the correct skills.

The later development of the drive-through restaurant encouraged the development of better holders for drinks, and a more fast-paced life and longer commute times made many drivers desire to drink their morning coffee in the car on the way to work. The 1960s saw coffee cups with wide, flat, rubberised bases being sold, which would keep them steady on the dash or console. A little later, aftermarket cup holders began to be sold. These often clipped onto the door windows, although other designs wedge in between the front seats and the center console. Built-in cup holders began to be available in the 1920s. Minivans were pioneers in their availability, and they still offer the greatest number of them. Over time, automotive cup holders have become larger and more sophisticated, so that they can hold a variety of different cup sizes securely. Many offer spring-loaded holders that clasp the cup securely, no matter how large or small. The development of ever-larger cups by fast-food chains and convenience stores in the United States has proven a challenge to automotive designers; many fast-food chains now offer 44 fl.oz. (1.3 L) drinks. The automobile cup-holder has also driven the development of \\"car cups\\" designed to fit within most cars' cup holders; these have a narrower base but flare outward after a short cylindrical distance. The installation of cup holders in automobiles increased significantly after Stella Liebeck v. McDonald's Corporation, in which a 79-year-old woman in Albuquerque, New Mexico ordered hot coffee from a McDonald's restaurant and, when it spilled, was scalded so severely she required skin grafts. In her suit against McDonald's the jury awarded her US$2.7 million in damages (later reduced by the judge to US$640,000). Before the inevitable appeal could be heard, the case was settled privately for an undisclosed sum. Desktop cup holder Earlier wood versions of cup holders for tops of desks have been around decades such as one featured in a U.S. Airline catalog in the late 1980s. Cup holders for edges of desks and tables really picked up steam in the U.S. around 2006. Cup holders for such a use weren't for sale on the internet in the U.S. during most or all of 2005 and possibly not prior. The 1st appearance 2005 to 2006 was by Antro Technology with a cup holder for the edge of a construction table. The 2nd was a South Korean import with a clip for an indoor table. People sometimes drink beverages at their tables and work desks. It is very easy to knock over a cup or mug full of hot tea or coffee and this can then damage expensive laptops or keyboards. Also the hot liquid may cause injury to people or damage to books or carpets. On a table or work desk, coffee cups can be knocked over by the person sitting and working at the desk by their arms or hands. This can happen very easily if they are disturbed e.g. by a telephone call or by a sudden impulse move. Coffee cups on desks can also be knocked over by pets such as dogs or cats who may jump up on to the desk. Coffee or tea can also spill out of a cup if the table is knocked by a person walking by. Several devices were patented to hold coffee cups. The main problem in the endeavor is to provide a mechanism to hold the handle of the cup which usually protrudes a few centimeters from the side of the mug. Another problem facing the inventors is the varying sizes of coffee cups. Some devices which were patented are as follows. * US patent number 5984136 1999. This cup holder has slots to hold the handle and relies on an extended base to hold the cup upright. * US patent number 6039206 2000. This cup holder features legs which extend when the cup is placed into the holder. * US patent number D645,308 2011. This cup holder for a surface solves a lot of previous problems. It was shown shortly before being granted on U.S. television however it was never sold. In Japan several patents were applied for, but they were not finalized. They have since been commercialized by other manufacturers. These are: * Number 2006314739. * Number 2995040642. This cup holder has slots to accommodate the cups handle and has a suction cup to attach the holder to a smooth flat surface, so that it is held securely. New Zealand patent number 565067. This is a completely free-standing desktop coffee cup holder that can sit on any flat surface this was invented by Digby Green, George Green and Aly Matthews. It can be manufactured in several materials, e.g. wood, metal or plastic. It has been manufactured in plastic by Adovationz Ltd in New Zealand under the brand name of Adkaf. Dorian Gibbs of Los Angeles, California had the earliest workable cup holder that attaches to a flat edge in the U.S. with US 5,842,671 granted Dec. 1, 1998. US 6,929,229 was granted on Aug. 16, 2005 to Chris D. Palmby of Bellingham, Washington. Perry Segretto of Elmhurst, Illinois had a similar cup holder pending like Palmby's in the U.S. around the same time. Segretto and Michael Koczor sold a cup holder called Drink Hold'em featured on HGTV's \\"I want that.\\" Antro Technology sold one similar briefly. A South Korean company imported a clip type cup holder to the U.S. No lawsuits were involved to slow the product though mail was received. An agenda regarding jobs with a patent trolls interest occurred during the time of the Obama Administration. A wide variety of cup holders that attach to cylinders were produced in the late 2000s and early 2010s. The bus/train/boat cup holder Cup holder installed on a bus. Before the automobile cup holders, many buses and trains were built with wall-mounted cup holders. These cup holders are usually constructed by thin stainless steel plates. Some of them are covered by rubber. There are now many cup holders available which can be screwed to the walls of boats and buses and recreational vehicles. Another popular cup holder for boats is the \\"drop in\\" cup holder. This is a round plastic item, that has a lip at the top. It requires that a hole is drilled into the boat's table or console and then the unit is inserted and the lip holds it in place. These do not accommodate cups with handles. Cinema cup holder AMC Theatres patented cup holder armrests in 1981. The cup holder tree These are devices which hold several mugs usually in a kitchen or dining room. People often buy sets of mugs for use in a family or guest situation and they need a place to store them ready for use. These cup holder trees are available in two types. The first type has a base with a vertical mast from which there are hooks to hold each cup or of an \\"accordion\\" arm where pegs are placed at each junction of a pivot point. The second type is screwed or mounted underneath shelves or in kitchen cupboards etc. See also * Bottle cage * Podstakannik, a hand-held tea glass holder References  External links  * \\"How U.S. car design came to include cup holders\\".

RAF Barkston Heath has the Naval and Army Elements of No. 3 Flying Training School RAF (No. 3 FTS) which, for a period between approximately 1995 and 2010, operated the Slingsby T67M260 Firefly, followed by the Grob Tutor T1 operated between 2010 and 2018. No. 3 FTS currently provide elementary flying training for Royal Navy and Army Air Corps students on the Grob Prefect T1. A secondary role of RAF Barkston Heath is as a Relief Landing Ground for the flying training activities at RAF Cranwell.  History  At the time of its construction, Barkston Heath was intended for use by the RAF's No. 7 Group, in common with a number of other airfields in the Grantham area. =United States Army Air Forces use= Douglas C-47 Skytrain assigned to 314th Troop Carrier Squadron at RAF Barkston Heath in 1945. In late 1943, Barkston Heath was made available to the United States Army Air Force's Ninth Air Force. It was earmarked for basing troop carrier units scheduled to be transferred from Sicily to participate in the forthcoming cross-Channel invasion, Operation Overlord. During its time as a USAAF airfield, Barkston Heath was designated as USAAF station 483.  61st Troop Carrier Group  The first US personnel arrived on 13 February from Sciacca, Sicily, and most of their Douglas C-47 Skytrains on the 17th and 18th, although not all aircraft were in place until a month later. These new occupants were the 61st Troop Carrier Group with its components being: * 14th Troop Carrier Squadron (3I) * 15th Troop Carrier Squadron (Y9) * 53d Troop Carrier Squadron (3A) * 59th Troop Carrier Squadron (X5) The 61st TCG was part of the 52nd Troop Carrier Wing, IX Troop Carrier Command. The headquarters of the 61st Troop Carrier Group moved to an Advanced Landing Ground (ALG) at Abbeville (ALG B-92), France, on 13 March 1945, but its squadrons went to RAF Chipping Ongar from where they participated in Operation Varsity on 24 March carrying British paratroops who dropped near Wesel.  349th Troop Carrier Group  An increased demand for theatre air transport brought the 349th TCG from Baer Field Indiana in late March 1945, with its Curtiss C-46 Commando transports. Group headquarters was established at Barkston on 30 March, but the group only remained three weeks before moving to Rove/Amy, France, on 18 April. The squadrons of the 349th TCG were coded as follows: the 23rd -08, 312th -9E, 313th -3F, and 314th -LY. It was assigned to the 52nd Troop Carrier Wing. In May, a detachment of C-46s from this group returned to airlift British 1st Airborne Division troops to Norway. =Royal Air Force use= The USAAF returned control of the airfield to the Air Ministry in June 1945 when the war in Europe ended. Barkston Heath was used by No. 256 Maintenance Unit RAF and No. 2 Squadron RAF Regiment. From May 1948 it was assigned to RAF Cranwell as a relief landing ground, and this role continues today. In the 1960s, 2 of the 4 Jet Provost training squadrons of the RAF College were resident and operated out of Barkston Heath, with instructors and cadets commuting daily from nearby Cranwell. The airfield was also used during the 1980s by a number of privately owned aircraft of various types, and for several years it has also been the venue for the British National Model Aircraft Championships. From 1983 to 1989 Barkston was home to 'A' Flight 25 Squadron (with Bristol Bloodhound surface-to-air missiles) when they returned from RAF Bruggen in Germany. For a while Barkston was the home of Red Dragon flight delivering Prince Charles's basic flight training.  Elementary Flying Training  A line-up of Slingsby T67 Firefly aircraft of the Defence Flying Training School at Barkston Heath in 2008. On 1 April 1995, the Joint Elementary Flying Training School (JEFTS), which provided training to RAF and Fleet Air Arm (FAA) pilots, relocated to Barkston Heath from RAF Topcliffe in North Yorkshire. The school was equipped with eighteen civilian registered Slingsby T67M Firefly trainer aircraft. In 1996 the Army Air Corps (AAC) joined JEFTS and the school operated as a tri-service organisation until 2003 when the RAF decided to instead provide elementary flying training through its network of University Air Squadrons. JEFTS as a result was renamed the Defence Elementary Flying Training School in July 2003, with the FAA element re- establishing itself as 703 Naval Air Squadron (703 NAS) and the AAC element as No. 674 Squadron. In November 2009 the Fireflies were retired and replaced with the Grob Tutor T1. =Other units= The following units were also here at some point: *No. 1 Elementary Flying Training School RAF *No. 2 Central Flying School RAF *No. 2 Flying Instructors School RAF *No. 3 (Coastal) Operational Training Unit RAF *No. 7 Equipment Disposal Depot RAF *No. 85 Squadron RAF *RAF College *RAF College Flying Training School RAF *RAF College Service Flying Training School RAF  Infrastructure and facilities  A communications mast, buildings and crash gate at RAF Barkston Heath. The RAF Barkston Heath site extends to . It has three runways, 06/24 which is long, 10/28 which is long and 18/36 which is long, all constructed from asphalt. The airfield has limited facilities and relies on its parent station RAF Cranwell for support. The main building at Barkston Heath is the Operational Support Building which was re-opened in January 2018 after refurbishment as part of the UK Military Flying Training System (UKMFTS) programme. It was renamed the Esmonde Building in memory of Lieutenant Commander Eugene Esmonde, a distinguished Fleet Air Arm pilot who was a posthumous recipient of the Victoria Cross. Out of six T2 type hangar and one B1 type constructed during the Second World War, only two T2 type remain on the site. Due to the relatively small aircraft that used Barkston Heath over the years, there has never been a requirement to lengthen the airfield's runways, consequently its war-time layout has remained largely preserved, including fifty aircraft hardstandings and loop dispersals.  Role and operations  = Defence Elementary Flying Training School = left RAF Barkston Heath is home to the Defence Elementary Flying Training School, comprising 703 Naval Air Squadron (703 NAS) and No. 674 Squadron Army Air Corps. Both units operate the Grob Prefect T1 in the elementary flying training role. Aircraft and support are provided by a civilian contractor, Ascernt Flight Training, as part of the UK Military Flying Training System contract. Ascent also provides a significant proportion of the instructional staff, the Air Traffic Control service is provided by NATS Solutions Ltd, Affinity provide engineering personnel and other Station support personnel are provided by NBC and the MoD. Although the school trains Fleet Air Arm and Army Air Corps crews, it is under the command of the RAF's No. 3 Flying Training School, based at nearby RAF Cranwell.  703 Naval Air Squadron  703 NAS trains Fleet Air Arm pilots destined to fly both rotary (AgustaWestland Merlin and AgustaWestland Wildcat) and fixed wing aircraft (Lockheed Martin F-35B II Lightning and BAE Hawk). Helicopter students graduate to No. 1 Flying Training School (1 FTS) at RAF Shawbury in Shropshire, whereas fast jet students move onto No. 4 Flying Training School at RAF Valley in Anglesey.  No. 674 Squadron  No. 674 Squadron of the Army Air Corps trains British Army pilots who will go onto No. 1 Flying Training School and eventually fly front-line helicopters such as the Boeing Apache and AgustaWestland Wildcat. = Relief Landing Ground = Barkston Heath acts as a Relief Landing Ground for the flying training activities at RAF Cranwell, which is four minutes flying time away.

Instead of adding new elements to the real numbers, Nelson's approach modifies the axiomatic foundations through syntactic enrichment. Thus, the axioms introduce a new term, \\"standard\\", which can be used to make discriminations not possible under the conventional axioms for sets. Thus, IST is an enrichment of ZFC: all axioms of ZFC are satisfied for all classical predicates, while the new unary predicate \\"standard\\" satisfies three additional axioms I, S, and T. In particular, suitable nonstandard elements within the set of real numbers can be shown to have properties that correspond to the properties of infinitesimal and unlimited elements. Nelson's formulation is made more accessible for the lay- mathematician by leaving out many of the complexities of meta-mathematical logic that were initially required to justify rigorously the consistency of number systems containing infinitesimal elements. Intuitive justification Whilst IST has a perfectly formal axiomatic scheme, described below, an intuitive justification of the meaning of the term standard is desirable. This is not part of the formal theory, but is a pedagogical device that might help the student interpret the formalism. The essential distinction, similar to the concept of definable numbers, contrasts the finiteness of the domain of concepts that we can specify and discuss with the unbounded infinity of the set of numbers; compare finitism. * The number of symbols one writes with is finite. * The number of mathematical symbols on any given page is finite. * The number of pages of mathematics a single mathematician can produce in a lifetime is finite. * Any workable mathematical definition is necessarily finite. * There are only a finite number of distinct objects a mathematician can define in a lifetime. * There will only be a finite number of mathematicians in the course of our (presumably finite) civilization. * Hence there is only a finite set of whole numbers our civilization can discuss in its allotted lifespan. * What that limit actually is, is unknowable to us, being contingent on many accidental cultural factors. * This limitation is not in itself susceptible to mathematical scrutiny, but that there is such a limit, whilst the set of whole numbers continues forever without bound, is a mathematical truth. The term standard is therefore intuitively taken to correspond to some necessarily finite portion of \\"accessible\\" whole numbers. The argument can be applied to any infinite set of objects whatsoever ‚Äì there are only so many elements that one can specify in finite time using a finite set of symbols and there are always those that lie beyond the limits of our patience and endurance, no matter how we persevere. We must admit to a profusion of nonstandard elements ‚Äî too large or too anonymous to grasp ‚Äî within any infinite set. =Principles of the standard predicate= The following principles follow from the above intuitive motivation and so should be deducible from the formal axioms. For the moment we take the domain of discussion as being the familiar set of whole numbers. * Any mathematical expression that does not use the new predicate standard explicitly or implicitly is an internal formula. * Any definition that does so is an external formula. * Any number uniquely specified by an internal formula is standard (by definition). * Nonstandard numbers are precisely those that cannot be uniquely specified (due to limitations of time and space) by an internal formula. * Nonstandard numbers are elusive: each one is too enormous to be manageable in decimal notation or any other representation, explicit or implicit, no matter how ingenious your notation. Whatever you succeed in producing is _by-definition_ merely another standard number. * Nevertheless, there are (many) nonstandard whole numbers in any infinite subset of N. * Nonstandard numbers are completely ordinary numbers, having decimal representations, prime factorizations, etc. Every classical theorem that applies to the natural numbers applies to the nonstandard natural numbers. We have created, not new numbers, but a new method of discriminating between existing numbers. * Moreover, any classical theorem that is true for all standard numbers is necessarily true for all natural numbers. Otherwise the formulation \\"the smallest number that fails to satisfy the theorem\\" would be an internal formula that uniquely defined a nonstandard number. * The predicate \\"nonstandard\\" is a logically consistent method for distinguishing large numbers ‚Äî the usual term will be illimited. Reciprocals of these illimited numbers will necessarily be extremely small real numbers ‚Äî infinitesimals. To avoid confusion with other interpretations of these words, in newer articles on IST those words are replaced with the constructs \\"i-large\\" and \\"i-small\\". * There are necessarily only finitely many standard numbers - but caution is required: we cannot gather them together and hold that the result is a well-defined mathematical set. This will not be supported by the formalism (the intuitive justification being that the precise bounds of this set vary with time and history). In particular we will not be able to talk about the largest standard number, or the smallest nonstandard number. It will be valid to talk about some finite set that contains all standard numbers - but this non-classical formulation could only apply to a nonstandard set. Formal axioms for IST IST is an axiomatic theory in the first-order logic with equality in a language containing a binary predicate symbol ‚àà and a unary predicate symbol st(x). Formulas not involving st (i.e., formulas of the usual language of set theory) are called internal, other formulas are called external. We use the abbreviations :\\\\begin{align}\\\\exists^\\\\mathrm{st}x\\\\,\\\\phi(x)&=\\\\exists x\\\\,(\\\\operatorname{st}(x)\\\\land\\\\phi(x)),\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\forall^\\\\mathrm{st}x\\\\,\\\\phi(x)&=\\\\forall x\\\\,(\\\\operatorname{st}(x)\\\\to\\\\phi(x)).\\\\end{align} IST includes all axioms of the Zermelo‚ÄìFraenkel set theory with the axiom of choice (ZFC). Note that the ZFC schemata of separation and replacement are not extended to the new language, they can only be used with internal formulas. Moreover, IST includes three new axiom schemata ‚Äì conveniently one for each letter in its name: Idealisation, Standardisation, and Transfer. =I: Idealisation= *For any internal formula \\\\phi without free occurrence of z, the universal closure of the following formula is an axiom: *:\\\\forall^\\\\mathrm{st}z\\\\,(z\\\\text{ is finite}\\\\to\\\\exists y\\\\,\\\\forall x\\\\in z\\\\,\\\\phi(x,y,u_1,\\\\dots,u_n))\\\\leftrightarrow\\\\exists y\\\\,\\\\forall^\\\\mathrm{st}x\\\\,\\\\phi(x,y,u_1,\\\\dots,u_n). *In words: For every internal relation R, and for arbitrary values for all other free variables, we have that if for each standard, finite set F, there exists a g such that R(g, f) holds for all f in F, then there is a particular G such that for any standard f we have R(G, f), and conversely, if there exists G such that for any standard f, we have R(G, f), then for each finite set F, there exists a g such that R(g, f) holds for all f in F. The statement of this axiom comprises two implications. The right-to-left implication can be reformulated by the simple statement that elements of standard finite sets are standard. The more important left-to-right implication expresses that the collection of all standard sets is contained in a finite (nonstandard) set, and moreover, this finite set can be taken to satisfy any given internal property shared by all standard finite sets. This very general axiom scheme upholds the existence of \\"ideal\\" elements in appropriate circumstances. Three particular applications demonstrate important consequences. Applied to the relation ‚â† If S is standard and finite, we take for the relation R(g, f): g and f are not equal and g is in S. Since \\"For every standard finite set F there is an element g in S such that for all f in F\\" is false (no such g exists when ), we may use Idealisation to tell us that \\"There is a G in S such that for all standard f\\" is also false, i.e. all the elements of S are standard. If S is infinite, then we take for the relation R(g, f): g and f are not equal and g is in S. Since \\"For every standard finite set F there is an element g in S such that for all f in F\\" (the infinite set S is not a subset of the finite set F), we may use Idealisation to derive \\"There is a G in S such that for all standard f.\\" In other words, every infinite set contains a nonstandard element (many, in fact). The power set of a standard finite set is standard (by Transfer) and finite, so all the subsets of a standard finite set are standard. If S is nonstandard, we take for the relation R(g, f): g and f are not equal and g is in S. Since \\"For every standard finite set F there is an element g in S such that for all f in F\\" (the nonstandard set S is not a subset of the standard and finite set F), we may use Idealisation to derive \\"There is a G in S such that for all standard f.\\" In other words, every nonstandard set contains a nonstandard element. As a consequence of all these results, all the elements of a set S are standard if and only if S is standard and finite. Applied to the relation < Since \\"For every standard, finite set of natural numbers F there is a natural number g such that for all f in F\\" ‚Äì say, ‚Äì we may use Idealisation to derive \\"There is a natural number G such that for all standard natural numbers f.\\" In other words, there exists a natural number greater than each standard natural number. Applied to the relation ‚àà More precisely we take for R(g, f): g is a finite set containing element f. Since \\"For every standard, finite set F, there is a finite set g such that for all f in F\\" ‚Äì say by choosing itself ‚Äì we may use Idealisation to derive \\"There is a finite set G such that for all standard f.\\" For any set S, the intersection of S with the set G is a finite subset of S that contains every standard element of S. G is necessarily nonstandard. =S: Standardisation= *If \\\\phi is any formula (it may be external) without a free occurrence of y, the universal closure of *:\\\\forall^\\\\mathrm{st}x\\\\,\\\\exists^\\\\mathrm{st}y\\\\,\\\\forall^\\\\mathrm{st}t\\\\,(t\\\\in y\\\\leftrightarrow(t\\\\in x\\\\land\\\\phi(t,u_1,\\\\dots,u_n))) :is an axiom. *In words: If A is a standard set and P any property, internal or otherwise, then there is a unique, standard subset B of A whose standard elements are precisely the standard elements of A satisfying P (but the behaviour of B's nonstandard elements is not prescribed). =T: Transfer= *If \\\\phi(x,u_1,\\\\dots,u_n) is an internal formula with no other free variables than those indicated, then *:\\\\forall^\\\\mathrm{st}u_1\\\\dots\\\\forall^\\\\mathrm{st}u_n\\\\,(\\\\forall^\\\\mathrm{st}x\\\\,\\\\phi(x,u_1,\\\\dots,u_n)\\\\to\\\\forall x\\\\,\\\\phi(x,u_1,\\\\dots,u_n)) :is an axiom. *In words: If all the parameters A, B, C, ..., W of an internal formula F have standard values then holds for all xs as soon as it holds for all standard xs--from which it follows that all uniquely defined concepts or objects within classical mathematics are standard. Formal justification for the axioms Aside from the intuitive motivations suggested above, it is necessary to justify that additional IST axioms do not lead to errors or inconsistencies in reasoning. Mistakes and philosophical weaknesses in reasoning about infinitesimal numbers in the work of Gottfried Leibniz, Johann Bernoulli, Leonhard Euler, Augustin-Louis Cauchy, and others were the reason that they were originally abandoned for the more cumbersome real number-based arguments developed by Georg Cantor, Richard Dedekind, and Karl Weierstrass, which were perceived as being more rigorous by Weierstrass's followers. The approach for internal set theory is the same as that for any new axiomatic system - we construct a model for the new axioms using the elements of a simpler, more trusted, axiom scheme. This is quite similar to justifying the consistency of the axioms of non-Euclidean geometry by noting they can be modeled by an appropriate interpretation of great circles on a sphere in ordinary 3-space. In fact via a suitable model a proof can be given of the relative consistency of IST as compared with ZFC: if ZFC is consistent, then IST is consistent. In fact, a stronger statement can be made: IST is a conservative extension of ZFC: any internal formula that can be proven within internal set theory can be proven in the Zermelo‚ÄìFraenkel axioms with the Axiom of Choice alone.Nelson, Edward (1977).

CIA Director George Tenet (left) and UN Ambassador John Negroponte look on from behind. The Senate Select Committee on Intelligence found that many of the allegations in the speech were not supported by the underlying intelligence. The Senate Report on Iraqi WMD Intelligence (formally, the \\"Report of the Select Committee on Intelligence on the U.S. Intelligence Community's Prewar Intelligence Assessments on Iraq\\") was the report by the United States Senate Select Committee on Intelligence concerning the U.S. intelligence community's assessments of Iraq during the time leading up to the 2003 invasion of Iraq. The report, which was released on July 9, 2004, identified numerous failures in the intelligence-gathering and -analysis process. The report found that these failures led to the creation of inaccurate materials that misled both government policy makers and the American public. The Committee's nine Republicans and eight Democrats agreed on the report's major conclusions and unanimously endorsed its findings. They disagreed, though, on the impact that statements on Iraq by senior members of the Bush administration had on the intelligence process. The second phase of the investigation, addressing the way senior policymakers used the intelligence, was published on May 25, 2007. Portions of the phase II report not released at that time include the review of public statements by U.S. government leaders prior to the war, and the assessment of the activities of Douglas Feith and the Pentagon's Office of Special Plans.  Background  After the 1991 Gulf War, Iraq agreed to destroy its stockpiles of weapons of mass destruction (WMD) and dismantle its WMD programs. To verify compliance, UN inspection teams were to be given free access to the country. Over the next seven years, inspectors sometimes complained about non-cooperation and evasiveness by the Iraqi government. Iraqi officials in turn complained that some weapons inspectors were acting as spies for foreign intelligence agencies. In 1998, after a critical report on the Iraqi government's noncompliance was issued by UN weapons inspector Richard Butler, U.S. President Bill Clinton announced that he would launch airstrikes on Iraqi targets (see Operation Desert Fox). Butler evacuated his inspectors and the bombing proceeded. After the bombing campaign, Iraq refused to allow weapons inspectors to re-enter the country. After George W. Bush became president in January 2001, and especially after the September 11 attacks, the U.S. government increased its attention on Iraq. In the first half of 2002, a series of public statements by President Bush and senior members of his administration indicated a willingness to use force, if necessary, to remove Saddam Hussein from power. On October 1, 2002, the CIA delivered a classified National Intelligence Estimate (NIE) assessing the threat represented by Iraq's WMD activities. Three days later, CIA Director George Tenet published an unclassified white paper on the subject of Iraq's WMD capabilities. Over the next two weeks, a joint resolution authorizing the use of force was passed by both houses of Congress. Over the next several months the U.S. conducted a diplomatic effort at the United Nations, seeking to obtain that body's approval for a new WMD inspection regime, and, potentially, for the use of force to overthrow the Iraqi government. The UN Security Council passed resolution 1441 on November 8, 2002, calling on Iraq to make \\"an accurate full, final, and complete disclosure\\" of its WMD programs, and threatening \\"serious consequences\\" if it did not comply. In the wake of resolution 1441, Iraq allowed UN weapons inspectors to return to the country. While the inspections were taking place, the U.S. continued to lobby the members of the UN Security Council to pass a resolution explicitly authorizing the use of force against Iraq. As part of that effort U.S. Secretary of State Colin Powell gave a presentation to the UN on February 5, 2003, in which he detailed false intelligence gatherings provided by the Israeli government regarding Iraqi WMD. The USA was faced with the opposition of a majority of the Security Council's members, including Germany, France, and Russia, and afterwards abandoned the effort to obtain an explicit use-of- force authorization from the UN. Operation Iraqi Freedom. \\"The people of the United States and our friends and allies will not live at the mercy of an outlaw regime that threatens the peace with weapons of mass murder.\\" The Senate committee found that many of the administration's pre-war statements about Iraqi WMD were not supported by the underlying intelligence. On March 20, 2003, the U.S. and its allies invaded Iraq, an action that led to the overthrow of the government of Saddam Hussein. Over the ensuing year, U.S. and allied forces searched for evidence supporting the pre-invasion claims about Iraqi WMD stockpiles and programs. The lead role in this search was played by the Iraq Survey Group (ISG), consisting of investigators from the U.S. Department of Defense and the CIA. Although scattered remnants of Iraq's WMD stockpiles from the time of the 1991 Gulf War were found, the ISG's final report concluded that Iraq did not possess significant WMD capabilities at the time of the invasion Iraq. The ISG also stated that Iraq had intended to restart all banned weapons programs as soon as multilateral sanctions against it had been dropped. As these facts were emerging in June 2003, U.S. Senator Pat Roberts (R-KS), chairman of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, announced that the Committee, as part of its regular oversight responsibility, would conduct a \\"thorough and bipartisan review\\" of Iraqi WMD and ties to terrorist groups. On June 20, 2003, Senator Roberts and Senator John D. Rockefeller IV (D-WV), the Committee's vice chairman, issued a joint press release announcing that the committee would conduct a detailed review of the Iraqi WMD intelligence process, including the following areas: * the quantity and quality of U.S. intelligence on Iraqi weapons of mass destruction programs, ties to terrorist groups, Saddam Hussein's threat to stability and security in the region, and his repression of his own people; * the objectivity, reasonableness, independence, and accuracy of the judgments reached by the Intelligence Community; * whether those judgments were properly disseminated to policy makers in the Executive Branch and Congress; * whether any influence was brought to bear on anyone to shape their analysis to support policy objectives; and * other issues we mutually identify in the course of the Committee's review.  Investigation committee membership  The following nine Republicans were members of the Committee at the time the investigation was launched: Committee Chairman C. Patrick Roberts (R-KS), Orrin G. Hatch (R-UT), R. Michael DeWine (R-OH), Christopher S. \\"Kit\\" Bond (R-MO), C. Trent Lott (R-MS), Olympia J. Snowe (R-ME), Charles Hagel (R-NE), C. Saxby Chambliss (R-GA), and John W. Warner (R-VA). The following eight Democrats made up the rest of the Committee: Vice-Chairman John D. \\"Jay\\" Rockefeller IV (D-WV), Carl Levin (D-MI), Dianne Feinstein (D-CA), Ronald L. Wyden (D-OR), Richard J. Durbin (D-IL), B. Evans \\"Evan\\" Bayh III (D-IN), Johnny R. \\"John\\" Edwards (D-NC), and Barbara A. Mikulski (D-MD). = Chronology = In the course of the investigation, Committee staff reviewed more than 30,000 pages of documentation provided by the intelligence community. The Committee requested that it be supplied copies of the President's Daily Briefs (PDBs) concerning Iraq's WMD capabilities and ties to terrorism, but the White House denied that request. An article by journalist Murray Waas has described a specific controversy over the PDB for September 21, 2001, which allegedly said that the US intelligence community had \\"no evidence\\" linking Saddam Hussein to the September 11 attacks, and \\"scant credible evidence\\" that Iraq had any significant collaborative ties with al Qaeda. Committee staff also interviewed more than 200 people, including intelligence analysts and senior officials with the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), Defense Intelligence Agency, the Department of Defense, and other federal entities involved in intelligence gathering and analysis. The Committee also held a series of hearings on the intelligence concerning Iraqi WMD and ties to terrorism. On February 12, 2004, Senators Roberts and Rockefeller announced an expansion of the scope of the investigation. The new elements added to the investigation were: * the collection of intelligence on Iraq from the end of the Gulf War to the commencement of Operation Iraqi Freedom; * whether public statements and reports and testimony regarding Iraq by U.S. Government officials made between the Gulf War period and the commencement of Operation Iraqi Freedom were substantiated by intelligence information; * the postwar findings about Iraq's weapons of mass destruction and weapons programs and links to terrorism and how they compare with prewar assessments; * prewar intelligence assessments about postwar Iraq; * any intelligence activities relating to Iraq conducted by the Policy Counterterrorism Evaluation Group (PCTEG) and the Office of Special Plans within the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Policy; and * the use by the Intelligence Community of information provided by the Iraqi National Congress (INC). On June 17, 2004, Senators Roberts and Rockefeller announced that the completed report had been unanimously approved by the Committee's members, and that they were working with the CIA on the issue of declassification. The completed report, with blacked-out text (\\"redactions\\") made by the CIA, was released on July 9, 2004. The report did not cover most of the new topics announced in the February 12, 2004, press release; instead, those topics were now to be covered in a separate report, to be completed later, covering \\"phase two\\" of the investigation.  Phase I conclusions  The 511-page report focuses much of its attention on the October, 2002, classified National Intelligence Estimate (NIE) titled Iraq's Continuing Programs for Weapons of Mass Destruction. The report includes 117 formal conclusions, as well as supporting discussion and background information. = General conclusions on intelligence relating to Iraq's WMD and ties to terrorism = The report's first conclusion points to widespread flaws in the October 2002 NIE, and attributes those flaws to failure by analysts in the intelligence community: :Most of the major key judgments in the Intelligence Community's October 2002 National Intelligence Estimate (NIE), Iraq's Continuing Programs for Weapons of Mass Destruction, either overstated, or were not supported by, the underlying intelligence reporting. A series of failures, particularly in analytic trade craft, led to the mischaracterization of the intelligence. Subsequent conclusions fault the intelligence community for failing to adequately explain to policymakers the uncertainties that underlay the NIE's conclusions, and for succumbing to \\"group think,\\" in which the intelligence community adopted untested (and, in hindsight, unwarranted) assumptions about the extent of Iraq's WMD stockpiles and programs. The committee identified a failure to adequately supervise analysts and collectors, and a failure to develop human sources of intelligence (HUMINT) inside Iraq after the departure of international weapons inspectors in 1998. It also cited the post-9/11 environment as having led to an increase in the intensity with which policymakers review and question threat information. = Niger and the Iraqi nuclear program = Section II of the report discussed the handling of intelligence indicating that Iraq might be attempting to purchase uranium from Niger. The report examined the role played by former ambassador Joseph Wilson in investigating the issue, and the way Wilson's assessment was communicated within the intelligence community. It also discusses the process whereby references to Iraq's uranium-procurement efforts were removed from some speeches at the behest of intelligence officials, but left in President Bush's 2003 State of the Union address. The report concludes that prior to October, 2002, it was reasonable for the intelligence community to assess Iraq may have been attempting to obtain uranium from Africa. Section III of the report discusses assessments of Iraq's domestic nuclear program. It focuses a significant amount of attention on the intelligence process that took place in the spring of 2001 regarding Iraq's attempts to purchase 60,000 high-strength aluminum tubes. The CIA concluded that the tubes could be intended for constructing centrifuges for a uranium- enrichment program (i.e., for a restarted Iraqi nuclear weapons program); analysts in the Department of Energy and the Department of Defense considered that to be unlikely. The October 2002 NIE stated that Iraq appeared to be reconstituting its nuclear weapons program. The Committee's report concluded that this view was not supported by the underlying intelligence, and the report agreed with the opinion of the State Department's Bureau of Intelligence and Research, expressed as an \\"alternative view\\" in the NIE, that the available intelligence did not make \\"a compelling case for reconstitution\\" of the Iraqi nuclear program. The committee reached several conclusions critical of poor communications between the CIA and other parts of the intelligence community concerning this issue. = Biological weapons, chemical weapons, and delivery systems = The sections of the report concerned with assessments of Iraq's biological weapons programs, chemical weapons programs, and delivery systems contain extensive discussion of the problem of inadequate \\"human intelligence\\" for intelligence gathering in Iraq. There is discussion of \\"CURVEBALL,\\" an Iraqi defector who provided much of the information regarding Iraq's alleged mobile bioweapons labs, although much of the material in this part of the report has been redacted. The report concludes that the October 2002 NIE and other statements regarding Iraq's biological and chemical WMD and associated delivery systems were for the most part not supported by the underlying intelligence data supplied to the Committee. Committee Chairman Pat Roberts told NBC's Tim Russert that \\"Curveball really provided 98 percent of the assessment as to whether or not the Iraqis had a biological weapon.\\"CNN.com - Pentagon's prewar intelligence role questioned - Jul 11, 2004. Edition.cnn.com. Retrieved on 2013-08-16. This was in despite the fact that \\"nobody inside the U.S. government had ever actually spoken to the informant‚Äîexcept [for a single] Pentagon analyst, who concluded the man was an alcoholic and utterly useless as a source.\\" After learning the intelligence provided by Curveball was going to be used as the \\"backbone\\" of the case for war, the Pentagon analyst wrote a letter to the CIA expressing his concerns. The Deputy of the CIA Counter Proliferation Unit quickly responded by saying: \\"Let's keep in mind the fact that this war's going to happen regardless of what Curve Ball said or didn't say. The Powers That Be probably aren't terribly interested in whether Curve Ball knows what he's talking about.\\" One area where the Committee found that the intelligence community's reporting accurately reflected the underlying intelligence concerned Iraq's retention of Scud-type ballistic missiles, and its development of new types of short- and medium-range missiles. In the case of the NIE's reporting on Iraq's development of an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), however, the Committee found that the reporting generally was not well-supported by the underlying intelligence, and overstated what was known concerning the likelihood that the Iraqi UAVs were intended for use as a delivery means for biological weapons. = Colin Powell's speech to the UN = Section VII of the Committee's report focuses on the intelligence behind Secretary of State Colin Powell's speech to the UN on February 5, 2003. The report describes the process whereby the CIA provided a draft of the speech to the National Security Council (NSC), and then, at the request of the NSC, worked to expand the speech with additional material, especially regarding Iraq's nuclear program. The report also describes the subsequent review made by Colin Powell and analysts from the State Department with analysts from the CIA. In the speech, Powell said that \\"every statement I make today is backed up by sources, solid sources. These are not assertions. What we're giving you are facts and conclusions based on solid intelligence.\\" Despite this, the Committee concluded that \\"[m]uch of the information provided or cleared by the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) for inclusion in Secretary Powell's speech was overstated, misleading, or incorrect.\\" = Pressure on analysts = The report partially looks at the question of whether pressure was brought to bear on intelligence analysts to get them to shape their assessments to support particular policy objectives. It recounts how Sen. Roberts made repeated public calls for any analysts who believed they had been pressured to alter their assessments to speak with the Committee about their experiences. The Committee also attempted to identify and interview several individuals who had described such pressure in media reports and government documents. The report says that the Committee did not find any evidence that administration officials tried to pressure analysts to change their judgments; however, an evaluation of the Bush Administration's use of intelligence was put off until \\"phase two\\" of the investigation. (Several Democratic committee members, although they voted to approve the report's conclusions, expressed reservations on this issue and Republicans also acknowledged that the issue of \\"pressure\\" would be examined during phase two; see below, in the discussion of the report's \\"additional views\\", for details.) = The October 2002 white paper = President George Bush, surrounded by leaders of the House and Senate, announces the Joint Resolution to Authorize the Use of United States Armed Forces Against Iraq, October 2, 2002. Lawmakers debated and passed the resolution during the following two weeks, basing their votes in part on the information in the classified National Intelligence Estimate and the unclassified white paper on Iraqi WMD -- documents that the Senate report on pre-war intelligence found to have been deeply flawed. A white paper titled \\"Iraq's Continuing Programs for Weapons of Mass Destruction\\" was released by CIA Director George Tenet on October 4, 2002, three days after the National Intelligence Estimate (NIE) on Iraqi WMD was released. In part, the white paper was a response to Congressional requests for an unclassified version of the information in the NIE, since that document was available only to a small group of lawmakers due to its classified nature. The white paper, although shorter and less-detailed than the NIE, was very similar to it in format and major conclusions. The Committee found that the white paper presented a significantly stronger characterization of the threat represented by Iraqi WMD than did the NIE, and that that stronger characterization was not supported by the underlying intelligence. = Iraq's alleged links to al-Qaeda = Several sections in the report examine topics relating to allegations of links between Iraq and terrorism. The Committee said that the intelligence community produced reasonable conclusions on this topic, although the Committee found gaps in the intelligence-gathering methods used (Page 350). Much of the Committee's investigation in this area concerned the CIA's preparation and distribution of a document titled Iraqi Support for Terrorism. An initial version of this document was distributed to senior Bush administration officials in September, 2002; an updated version of the document was provided to Congress in January, 2003. The conclusion of CIA analysts was that although Saddam Hussein's government had likely had several contacts with al Qaeda during the 1990s, \\"those contacts did not add up to an established formal relationship.\\" The CIA also attempted to determine the attitudes that Iraqi and al-Qaeda leadership held toward the possibility of working cooperatively with each other. The available intelligence in this area suggested that Iraqi and al-Qaeda leaders would be wary of working together. The \\"most problematic area of contact between Iraq and al-Qaida were the reports of training in the use of non- conventional weapons, specifically chemical and biological weapons.\\" Abu Musab al-Zarqawi had been present in Baghdad, and Ansar al-Islam, an al-Qaeda affiliate organization that identified itself as the \\"sworn enemy\\" of Saddam Hussein had operated in northeastern Iraq in an area under Kurdish control. There was no evidence proving Iraqi complicity or assistance in an al Qaeda attack. The report criticized the CIA for its lack of human intelligence resources in Iraq to assess the country's ties with terrorism during the time prior to 2002. In terms of pressure on analysts, the Committee said that after 9/11, \\"analysts were under tremendous pressure to make correct assessments, to avoid missing a credible threat, and to avoid an intelligence failure on the scale of 9/11.\\" The Committee concluded that this resulted in assessments that were \\"bold and assertive in pointing out potential terrorist links,\\" and that this pressure was more the result of analysts' own desire to be as thorough as possible, than of any undue influence by the administration, for which the Committee said they found no evidence. Several Democratic members of the Committee said in the report's \\"additional views\\" that the question had not been adequately explored.  The report's \\"additional views\\"  The Republican and Democratic members of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence voted unanimously to approve the finished report. There were, however, significant areas of disagreement, with those disagreements being expressed in the form of \\"additional views\\" attached at the end of the report proper. = Senators Roberts, Hatch, and Bond = In the first \\"additional view\\" attached to the report, Chairman Pat Roberts (R-KS), joined by Senators Orrin Hatch (R-UT) and Christopher Bond (R-MO), presents two conclusions that Democratic members of the Committee were unwilling to include in the report, even though, according to Roberts, \\"there was no dispute with the underlying facts.\\" Those two conclusions related to the actions of Joseph Wilson, the former ambassador who was sent to Niger in 2002 to investigate allegations that the Iraqi government was attempting to purchase \\"yellowcake\\" uranium, presumably as part of an attempt to revive Iraq's nuclear weapons program. The two conclusions were that the plan to send Wilson to investigate the Niger allegation was suggested by Wilson's wife, a CIA employee, and that in his later public statements criticizing the Bush administration, Wilson included information he had learned from press accounts, misrepresenting it as firsthand knowledge. This additional view also discusses the question of pressure on analysts, and recommends caution in implementing reforms in the intelligence community. = Senators Rockefeller, Levin, and Durbin = Senators John D. Rockefeller (D-WV) (the Committee's vice-chairman), Carl Levin (D-MI), and Richard Durbin (D-IL), used their additional view to say that the report painted an incomplete picture, because the Committee had put off until phase two of the investigation the key question of \\"how intelligence on Iraq was used or misused by Administration officials in public statements and reports.\\" Because of this, they said, \\"the Committee's phase one report fails to fully explain the environment of intense pressure in which Intelligence Community officials were asked to render judgments on matters relating to Iraq when policy officials had already forcefully stated their own conclusions in public.\\" = Senators Chambliss, Hatch, Lott, Hagel, and Bond = The third additional view in the report is by Senator Saxby Chambliss (R-GA), with Senators Orrin Hatch (R-UT), Trent Lott (R-MS), Chuck Hagel (R-NE), and Christopher Bond (R-MO). It focuses on the issues of information sharing and Human Intelligence (HUMINT), and rebuts the allegation of \\"pressure\\" contained in the additional view by Senators Rockefeller, Levin, and Durbin. = Other additional views = Senator Olympia Snow (R-ME) wrote in her additional view that the Committee's report revealed poor management and a lack of accountability in the intelligence community, and she called for strong reforms. Senator John Warner (R-VA) used his additional view to defend the integrity and professionalism of front-line intelligence analysts, and to emphasize that \\"there was no evidence that anyone involved in reaching intelligence judgments for this NIE was subjected to any pressure from their superiors or from policymakers to alter any of their judgments or analyses.\\" The additional view by Senator Dianne Feinstein (D-CA), was critical of the Bush administration, saying it \\"did not fairly represent the intelligence.\\" Senator Ron Wyden (D-OR) was also critical of the Bush administration in his additional view, giving a list of public statements by senior members of the administration that misstated and exaggerated the underlying intelligence on Iraq. Senator Richard Durbin (D-IL) focused on the need for greater accountability for the intelligence failures identified in the report. Senator Barbara Mikulski (D-MD) used her additional view to argue for a number of specific structural and procedural reforms in the intelligence community.  \\"Phase two\\" of the investigation  At the time of the report's release (July 9, 2004), Democratic members of the committee expressed the hope that \\"phase two\\" of the investigation, which was to include an assessment of how the Iraqi WMD intelligence was used by senior policymakers, would be completed quickly. Committee Chairman Pat Roberts (R-KS) said of phase two, \\"It is a priority. I made my commitment and it will get done.\\" On March 10, 2005, during a question-and-answer session after a speech he had given at the Woodrow Wilson Center, Senator Roberts said of the failure to complete phase two, \\"[T]hat is basically on the back burner.\\" Senator John D. Rockefeller (D-WV), vice chairman of the Committee, made a statement later that day in which he said, \\"The Chairman agreed to this investigation and I fully expect him to fulfill his commitment.... While the completion of phase two is long overdue, the committee has continued this important work, and I expect that we will finish the review in the very near future.\\" In a statement regarding the release of the report of the presidential WMD commission on March 31, 2005, Senator Roberts wrote, \\"I don't think there should be any doubt that we have now heard it all regarding prewar intelligence. I think that it would be a monumental waste of time to replow this ground any further.\\" On April 10, 2005, Senators Roberts and Rockefeller appeared together on NBC's Meet the Press program. In response to a question about the completion of phase two of the investigation, Roberts said, \\"I'm perfectly willing to do it, and that's what we agreed to do, and that door is still open. And I don't want to quarrel with Jay, because we both agreed that we would get it done. But we do have--we have Ambassador Negroponte next week, we have General Mike Hayden next week. We have other hot-spot hearings or other things going on that are very important.\\" Moderator Tim Russert then asked Senator Rockefeller if he believed phase two would be completed, and he replied, \\"I hope so. Pat and I have agreed to do it. We've shaken hands on it, and we agreed to do it after the elections so it wouldn't be any sort of sense of a political attack. I mean that was my view; it shouldn't be viewed that way.\\" On August 2, 2005, Senator Dianne Feinstein (D-CA) released the text of a letter she had sent to Senator Roberts, saying, in part, \\"I am increasingly dismayed by the delay in completing the Committee's 'Phase II' investigation into intelligence prior to the Iraq War.... I stand ready to participate in this investigation in any way possible.\\" On November 1, 2005, Senator Harry Reid (D-NV), the Senate minority leader, invoked a seldom-used provision of the Senate rules to place the body in a closed session. During a three-and-a- half hour discussion, agreement was reached on the creation of a six-member Senate panel to report by November 14 on \\"the intelligence committee's progress of the phase two review of the prewar intelligence and its schedule for completion.\\"GOP Angered by Closed Senate Session. Washingtonpost.com (2005-11-02). Retrieved on 2013-08-16. On April 26, 2006, an article by journalist Alexander Bolton in the Congressional journal The Hill reported that Committee Chairman Pat Roberts (R-KS) was seeking to further divide the phase two report. Under Roberts' new approach, the following components of the report would be released relatively quickly: pre-war intelligence assessments of post-war Iraq, postwar findings in Iraq regarding WMD and ties to terrorism, and the use by US intelligence of information supplied by the Iraqi National Congress. Two components of the report would be delayed: whether public statements before the war by senior government officials were supported by the underlying intelligence, and the role played by the Department of Defense's Office of Special Plans in developing the prewar intelligence. A September 7, 2006, article by journalist Jonathon Weisman in the Washington Post reported that the part of the phase two report comparing the Bush administration's public statements about Saddam Hussein with the evidence senior officials reviewed in private would not be released before the November 2006 election.Panel Set to Release Just Part of Report On Run-Up to War. Washingtonpost.com (2006-09-07). Retrieved on 2013-08-16. Two volumes of the phase II report were released on September 8, 2006: \\"Postwar Findings about Iraq's WMD Programs and Links to Terrorism and How they Compare with Prewar Assessments\\" and \\"The Use by the Intelligence Community of Information Provided by the Iraqi National Congress.\\" After Democrats gained a majority in the Senate during the 2006 midterm election, chairmanship of the committee passed to Sen. Jay Rockefeller (D-WV). The former chair, Sen. Pat Roberts (R-KS) left the committee; the ranking Republican and vice chairman of the committee is now Sen. Kit Bond (R-MO). On May 25, 2007, the committee released a volume of the phase II report titled, \\"Prewar Intelligence Assessments About Postwar Iraq\\". This volume of the report includes seven pages of conclusions regarding assessments provided by the intelligence community to U.S. government leaders prior to the Iraq war. The report concludes that the intelligence community had assessed that establishing a stable government in Iraq would be a \\"long, difficult, and probably turbulent challenge,\\" that Iraqi society was deeply divided and would engage in violent conflict unless an occupying power took steps to prevent it, and that the war would increase the threat of terrorism, at least temporarily. The intelligence community also assessed that a U.S. defeat and occupation of Iraq would lead to a surge in political Islam and increased funding for terrorist groups, and that the war would not cause other countries in the region to abandon their WMD programs. This volume of the report includes an appendix containing two previously classified reports by the National Intelligence Council (NIC) titled, \\"Regional Consequences of Regime Change in Iraq\\" and \\"Principal Challenges in Post-Saddam Iraq\\", as well as a long list of recipients within the government of NIC assessments on Iraq. The appendix also contains a number of \\"Additional Views\\" in which different members of the committee comment on the history of the committee's work in this area, and criticize what they characterize as the politicization of that work by members of the other party. Phase II of the report was publicly released on Thursday June 5, 2008 whether statements by US Government officials were substantiated by intelligence reports. This was a bi-partisan majority report (10-5) and \\"details inappropriate, sensitive intelligence activities conducted by the DoD's Office of the Undersecretary of Defense for Policy, without the knowledge of the Intelligence Community or the State Department.\\" It concludes that the US Administration \\"repeatedly presented intelligence as fact when in reality it was unsubstantiated, contradicted, or even non-existent. As a result, the American people were led to believe that the threat from Iraq was much greater than actually existed.\\" These included President Bush's statements of a partnership between Iraq and Al Qa'ida, that Saddam Hussein was preparing to give weapons of mass destruction to terrorist groups, and Iraq's capability to produce chemical weapons. The Chairman of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, Sen.Jay Rockefeller, stated in press release of report's publication\\"It is my belief that the Bush Administration was fixated on Iraq, and used the 9/11 attacks by al Qa'ida as justification for overthrowing Saddam Hussein. To accomplish this, top Administration officials made repeated statements that falsely linked Iraq and al Qa'ida as a single threat and insinuated that Iraq played a role in 9/11. Sadly, the Bush Administration led the nation into war under false pretenses. While the report highlights many of the problems with the intelligence and criticizes the Bush Administration for its handling of the lead up to the war and its reasons for doing so, the report also supports in many cases that claims made by the Bush Administration about Iraq's Weapons of Mass Destruction programs were \\"generally substantiated by the intelligence\\". \\"There is no question we all relied on flawed intelligence. But, there is a fundamental difference between relying on incorrect intelligence and deliberately painting a picture to the American people that you know is not fully accurate.\\" The Chairman of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, Sen.Jay Rockefeller twice alleged that the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Policy, or its former head Douglas Feith may have engaged in unlawful activities, Phase II of the report \\"found nothing to substantiate that claim; nothing unlawful about the \\"alleged\\" rogue intelligence operation in the PCTEG , nothing unlawful about the Office of Special Plans, and nothing unlawful about the so-called failure to inform Congress of alleged intelligence activities.\\" The previous year, the chairman released a press statement claiming that it appeared that the office's were \\"not in compliance with the law.\\" Yet, rather than pursue these allegations, Rockfeller decided to pursue an issue unrelated to the intelligence, and unrelated to Iraq. He pursued and inquiry of an exploratory meeting held in Rome in 2001 between two DOD officials and two Iranians. Writing for the Minority Opinion as part of the report it was stated that \\"After four years of making unsubstantiated allegations of unlawful activities, the calculus appears to be that proclamations of \\"inappropriate\\" behavior will generate the desired headlines focusing only on the caustic words, rather than the lack of substance behind them. We hope that these additional views will help redirect that focus to the evidence, or lack thereof.\\" Despite House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's telling her caucus members \\"that impeachment is off the table; she is not interested in pursuing it,\\" Dennis Kucinich D-Ohio introduced a formal resolution to the House of Representatives in an attempt to impeach President George W. Bush from the White House. House Democrats unanimously voted to send it to a committee; a maneuver that essentially killed Kucinich's efforts.

Though surrounded by motorists and within sight of large buildings, Maitland is unable to escape the median strip and must struggle for survival. Along the way he encounters other inhabitants of the median strip, which he comes to call \\"The Island,\\" including a teenaged prostitute who hides out in an abandoned air-raid bunker and an acrobat who became mentally handicapped in an accident and now salvages car parts for bizarre shamanic rituals. He learns to survive by scavenging discarded food from littering motorists, and eventually comes to think of the island as his true home.

It is served by the 7 train at all times and by the <7> train rush hours in the peak direction or after sporting events. This station is located near Flushing Meadows‚ÄìCorona Park in Willets Point, Queens, on Roosevelt Avenue between 114th and 126th Streets. The station was originally opened as a local station, Willets Point Boulevard, in 1927. It was rebuilt into the current layout of three tracks, two side platforms, and a center island platform for the 1939 New York World's Fair. The station's peak use occurs during Mets games at Citi Field (and at Shea Stadium from 1964 until 2008), located on the north side of the station, and during events at the USTA National Tennis Center, on the south side.  History  =Construction and opening= The 1910 Dual Contracts called for extending IRT and BMT lines to Brooklyn, Queens, and the Bronx. Queens did not receive many new IRT and BMT lines compared to Brooklyn and the Bronx, since the city's Public Service Commission (PSC) wanted to alleviate subway crowding in the other two boroughs first before building in Queens, which was relatively undeveloped. The IRT Flushing Line was to be one of two Dual Contracts lines in the borough, and it would connect Flushing and Long Island City, two of Queens' oldest settlements, to Manhattan via the Steinway Tunnel. When the majority of line was built in the early 1910s, most of the route went through undeveloped land, and Roosevelt Avenue had not been constructed. Community leaders advocated for more Dual Contracts lines to be built in Queens to allow development there. The original Willets Point Boulevard station opened on May 7, 1927. At that time, it was located at the intersection of Willets Point Boulevard, 126th Street, and Roosevelt Avenue and was a minor, local stop on the Flushing Line. Trains terminated at this station, with a shuttle bus to Flushing until that town's subway station could be built. On January 22, 1928, the station at Flushing opened, and Willets Point Boulevard became an intermediate station on the line. =Renovations= Aerial view, with Shea StadiumShea Stadium was replaced by Citi Field in 2009. in the background By December 1936 it was planned that for the additional crowds of the 1939 New York World's Fair that the station would be turned into a 3-platform, 4-track station capable of serving 40 trains per hour in each direction. Expansion of the Willets Point Boulevard station, as well as the construction of an Independent Subway System line to a planned World's Fair station nearby, was seen as essential for World's Fair access. The Flushing Line, until then a two-tracked line, was retrofitted with a third track to provide express service to the fair. World's Fair Special express trains began service on April 24, 1939. In 1950, a proposal to divert some buses' terminals from Flushing to Willets Point faced great opposition. Most of the opposition focused on the lack of business for Flushing business owners near the bus terminals there, as well as the increased travel times from Willets Point to points east. Supporters of the plan noted the heavy traffic congestion on Flushing streets and the narrowness of the stairways at the Main Street station. The platforms at Willets Point Boulevard were extended in 1955‚Äì1956 to accommodate 11-car trains. The northbound side platform and its ramp were added for the 1964 World's Fair, also held in Flushing Meadows; the station was renamed Willets Point‚ÄìShea Stadium when the Shea Stadium was built soon afterward. Today, remnants of the original 1927 station can be seen just east of the current station. Ironwork indicates where the old side platforms had been, and parts of the former fare entry area remain. The southbound side platform is also noticeably longer than the 11-car IRT-length trains that serve it; a long segment east of the current passenger waiting area‚Äîpart of the original southbound platform‚Äîhas fallen into disrepair and has been gated off. =Mets service= Long Island Rail Road station is at rear left and the USTA National Tennis Center is at rear right.alt= Express service to Manhattan at the conclusion of New York Mets weeknight games was first introduced in July 2007, followed by express service to Manhattan at the end of all Mets weeknight and weekend games in April 2008. The \\"super\\" express trains run for approximately one hour and only make three stops in Queens before entering Manhattan: 61st Street‚ÄìWoodside, Queensboro Plaza, and Court Square. After baseball games, Manhattan-bound local trains stop at the southbound side platform, while Manhattan-bound express trains and Main Street-bound trains both stop at the island platform. Following the closure and demolition of Shea Stadium, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority simply renamed the stop Mets‚ÄìWillets Point, omitting the corporate-sponsored name associated with the current stadium. The MTA was unsuccessful in achieving a similar naming rights deal and would not post the name for free. Had the naming rights deal been achieved, the station would have been known as Willets Point‚ÄìCiti Field. =AirTrain station= On January 20, 2015, New York Governor Andrew Cuomo announced a plan to build an AirTrain LaGuardia people mover, running along the Grand Central Parkway. This people mover would connect the station to LaGuardia Airport. In January 2017, the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey (PANYNJ) released its 10-year capital plan that included AirTrain LaGuardia funding. On February 6, 2017, the PANYNJ announced that it had opened a four-week-long request for proposals to design three AirTrain stations, including the Willets Point station, as well as plan the right of way from Willets Point to the airport. In May 2017, Parsons Brinckerhoff was hired to design the AirTrain. Construction is projected to start in 2019, with passenger service in 2023.  Station layout  This three-track express station has a layout unique in the system. From compass north to south, it is arranged: southbound side platform, southbound local track, center express track used for northbound service only, island platform, northbound local track, northbound side platform. The Fordham Road station on the IND Concourse Line in the Bronx has a similar layout: a split island platform as well as an unsplit island platform, but the Mets‚ÄìWillets Point station is the only station in the subway system with this particular setup. Trains running northbound (toward Main Street) normally open their doors on the island platform. The northbound side platform is used only during Mets games and events at the National Tennis Center, such as the U.S. Open. Some evening rush hour 7 local trains terminate at this station by using the express track. West of the station, there are switches between the local tracks, the express track, and the northern layup track to 111th Street. East of the station, switches allow trains on the express track in either direction to switch to the local track, but not vice versa. =Exits= Turnstiles on the Manhattan-bound platform that are used during events On the south side of the station, an ADA-accessible ramp connects the mezzanine and the northbound (southern) side platform to a footbridge, known as the Passarelle Boardwalk, which passes over Corona Yard and connects to the Mets‚ÄìWillets Point station on the Long Island Rail Road's Port Washington Branch, before entering the grounds of the National Tennis Center. A full-length wooden mezzanine is located underneath the tracks and platforms. There are stairways from the island platform to the mezzanine, and two non-ADA-accessible ramps from the southbound (northern) side platform to the mezzanine. The north side of the station has a stairway leading directly to Citi Field's Jackie Robinson Rotunda. = Accessibility = LIRR with Citi Field in the backgroundalt= In 2009, the northbound side platform became ADA-accessible to passengers with disabilities. The MTA built a $4 million ramp from the south side of Roosevelt Avenue to the station mezzanine; the two existing ramps from the mezzanine to station level were modified to make them ADA-accessible. The ramps are owned and maintained by the New York City Department of Parks and Recreation. Some riders with disabilities were unhappy that the station was not made completely accessible during the station's renovation. By contrast, other New York City Subway stations that serve sports venues, including 161st Street‚ÄìYankee Stadium for Yankee Stadium, 34th Street‚ÄìPenn Station at Seventh Avenue and Eighth Avenue for Madison Square Garden, and Atlantic Avenue‚ÄìBarclays Center for Barclays Center, are completely accessible. Northbound local trains open their doors on the side platform during Mets games and special events only, and as a result, disabled passengers who need to take the Manhattan-bound 7 train during Mets games and special events must take a Flushing-bound train one stop to continue their trip. The southbound platform and the center platform are not wheelchair-accessible. A footbridge had formerly extended north over Casey Stengel Plaza, leading to a long, circular staircase with turnstiles at the bottom, bringing people close to Gate E at Shea Stadium. In 2008, the footbridge and turnstiles were removed and replaced with a wider stairway which is now situated at Mets Plaza, close to Citi Field's Jackie Robinson Rotunda. The arrangement of turnstiles in the mezzanine was also reconfigured to improve the post-game pedestrian flows and allow fans to use all ramps, whether they were using the subway or walking across the Passarelle Boardwalk to reach the Long Island Rail Road station or parking lots in Flushing Meadows‚ÄìCorona Park.

It is one of the smaller species of diving-petrels, though size differences are seemingly indistinguishable between species unless seen up close. It is probably the least known of all five species.  Taxonomy and systematics  The genus name of the diving-petrels is Pelecanoides, which means \\"pelican-resembling\\", which refers to their distensible throat pouches they use to store prey. The specific name of the Magellanic diving-petrel, magellani, which honors Ferdinand Magellan, who discovered the Straits of Magellan that the birds are native to. This species has no subspecies, rendering it monotypic. According to HBW, this species is more closely related to the South Georgian and Peruvian diving-petrels. The diving-petrels bear strong resemblances to the smaller auk species (i.e. the Dovekie or Little Auk), though they are completely unrelated. This likeness is a prime example of convergent evolution, since the two have similar niches in their ecosystem, therefore they have evolved similar traits.  Description  This short, compact petrel ranges from 19-22 cm (7.4-8.7 in) in length, and weighs anywhere between 5-6 oz (males are typically heavier than females). The head of P. magellani is black, bordered by a contrasting white that leads into a distinctive white crescent extending up towards the back of the neck . The rest of the body follows a strong penguin-like black above, white below scheme, with some white streaks around the sides of the nape and on the scapulars. They also have some blackish-grey mottling on the flank region and sometimes on the sides of the breast. The upperwing is mostly black, with white edges on the secondaries; the underwing coverts are white (with some fragments of black on the \\"arm\\"), while the underside of the flight feathers are light grey. The tail feathers (rectrices) are mostly black above (but may appear brown in some lighting) with nearly invisible white tips, and mainly white to a very light grey below. The bill is mostly black, as well as the upward-facing nostrils (which are unique only to the diving-petrels), the legs and feet are a light slate-blue to light blue with black-brownish webs, and black claws, and the eyes are a very dark brown color. It only overlaps with the Peruvian diving-petrel, P. garnotii, but the two are distinguishable by the visible white crescent of the Magellanic vs. the nearly all-black head of the Peruvian.  Behavior and ecology  = Feeding = Being the most elusive of the Pelecanoides species, not much is known about the ecology of the Magellanic diving-petrel. Like all diving-petrel species, P. magellani is a strong swimmer capable of performing dives of over 10 ft to pursue prey, staying submerged anywhere from 10 seconds to potentially over a minute. The birds usual dive from the surface, though are capable of dropping a few feet from the air into the ocean. They move through the water by propelling themselves with their wings and steering with their tails and feet. The prey of P. magellani is shown to consist of small crustaceans, aquatic invertebrates like copepods, amphipods, and plankton, and perhaps small fish could be in their diet as well. They likely carry food back to their chicks via their gular pouches then regurgitating food through them. = Breeding = Breeding habits of the Magellanic diving-petrel are little known. It is known that eggs are laid from November to December, and fledglings have been spotted in March. Like its congeners, P. magellani nests in burrows in dense colonies on coastal islands. They lay one egg and are most likely monogamous like other Procellariiformes. Both parents take shifts between incubation and going out to sea to feed during the incubation period, and both take turns feeding their chick, which will reach sexual maturity anywhere from 2-3 years of age. After raising their offspring, the adults go into what is called post-nuptial moult, where they shed old feathers to grow fresh feathers, most notably their flight feathers. During this time, for all Pelecanoides species, they become flightless until their feathers have been fully replaced.  Distribution and habitat  P. magellani breeds on vegetated slopes on coastal and nearshore islands, typically in fjords and channels, in southern Chile, Argentina, and Tierra del Fuego and forages in offshore and inshore waters in the area.del Hoyo, J., A. Elliott, J. Sargatal. 1992. Handbook of the Birds of the World, Volume I. Barcelona: Lynx Edicions.

It is served by the 7 train at all times. History The express track above the station The station opened on October 13, 1925, with shuttle service between 111th Street and the previous terminal at Alburtis Avenue (now 103rd Street‚ÄìCorona Plaza). Shuttle service used the Manhattan-bound track. The line was extended to Willets Point Boulevard (now Mets‚ÄìWillets Point) on May 7, 1927, and to the current terminal at Flushing‚ÄìMain Street on January 21, 1928. The platforms at 111th Street were extended in 1955‚Äì1956 to accommodate 11-car trains. As part of the 2015‚Äì2019 Capital Program, the MTA would renovate the 52nd, 61st, 69th, 82nd, 103rd and 111th Streets stations, a project that has been delayed for several years but is slated to begin in mid-2020. Conditions at these stations were among the worst of all stations in the subway system. Station layout The station has five tracks and two side platforms. The express track is located on a flyover above the other four tracks. The two center tracks are not used in passenger service, but instead are used as yard leads of the Corona Yard, where 7 trains are maintained and stored. As a result, trains that go to/from the yard often terminate or begin at this station. Stations with flyover express tracks such as this were far more common on IRT elevated lines in Manhattan during the 19th and early 20th centuries. Due to the yard tracks, an unusual layout takes place in and east of the station. The two layup tracks only have connections to the main tracks east of the station. The eastbound track rises east of the station while the express track lowers. The layup tracks dive down and cross under the eastbound track. The westbound track then rises to level out the three tracks, which continue east. This station has full windscreens except at the west end of the eastbound platform, which has a waist-high steel fence instead. =Exits= Exit is at the south (geographic west) end, with staircases to all four corners of 111th Street and Roosevelt Avenue. The mezzanine and stairway landings are wooden while the flooring at the fare control area is concrete. The station has a crossunder between platforms. New signs have covered the old ones.

His father, Iago ab Idwal ap Meurig, had been king before him and his son, Gruffudd, was king after him. Iago was King of Gwynedd from 1023 to 1039 but was killed (possibly by his own men) while Cynan was still young. The throne was seized by Gruffydd ap Llywelyn, a member of a cadet branch of the royal dynasty. Cynan fled to Ireland and took refuge in the Viking settlement at Dublin. He married Ragnailt, the daughter of its King Olaf Sigtryggsson and granddaughter of King Sigtrygg Silkbeard. Ragnailt appeared on the list of the \\"Fair Women of Ireland\\" in the Book of Leinster and was also descended from Brian Boru. Cynan may have died fairly soon after the birth of their son Gruffudd, as the 13th- century History of Gruffydd ap Cynan details Cynan's ancestry but omits him from its account of Gruffudd's youth. Instead, Gruffudd's mother tells him about his father and the patrimony he should claim across the sea.History of Gruffydd ap Cynan, 13th c. Accessed 6 Feb 2013. Following two major Saxon invasions under Harold and Tostig Godwinson, Gruffydd ap Llywelyn was killed in 1063: the later Welsh Brut y Tywysogion reported he was done in by his own men, while the Ulster Chronicle stated he was killed by Cynan ab Iago. This may account for later records in Gwynedd calling Cynan a king or, alternatively, it may simply have been an honorary title on account of his family. If Cynan ruled, it was very briefly, for Bleddyn ap Cynfyn was installed by the Saxons the same year.

It is served by the 7 train at all times and by rush hour peak-direction <7> express service. History This elevated station opened on April 21, 1917 as Junction Avenue, as part of a large extension of the Flushing Line from its previous eastern terminus at Queensboro Plaza to Alburtis Avenue (now 103rd Street‚ÄìCorona Plaza). It was part of the Brooklyn‚ÄìManhattan Transit Corporation, albeit served by shuttles of IRT dimensions, and the two companies jointly operated the Flushing and Astoria Lines due to the provisions of the Dual Contracts. The station was renamed Junction Boulevard in 1940. The platforms at Junction Boulevard were extended in 1955‚Äì1956 to accommodate 11-car trains. In 1981, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority listed the station among the 69 most deteriorated stations in the subway system. Station layout Elevator from platform This station has two island platforms and three tracks. The two outer local tracks are used by the full-time 7 local service while the middle express track is used by the rush-hour peak direction <7> express service. Both platforms have red canopies with green frames and support columns in the center and are narrower at either ends. =Exits= This station has one elevated station house beneath the platforms tracks. Four staircases from each corner of Junction Boulevard and Roosevelt Avenue go up to a mezzanine that has a token booth in the center and a turnstile bank on the east and west sides. These turnstile banks lead to a crossunder and has a single staircase going up to each platform towards the west (railroad south) end. This station was made ADA accessible in 2007, at the cost of $6 million. From the northeast corner of the intersection this station is located at, a single elevator goes up to an enclosed overpass above the platforms with an intermediate stop at the mezzanine. The overpass has two HEET turnstiles and a gate that is automatically opened when a MetroCard is swiped at either turnstile. Inside, two elevators go down to the platforms, one for each. Previously, an \\"AutoGate\\" Reduced-fare MetroCard was required to open the gate. An emergency staircase goes down to the Manhattan-bound platform and an employee-facility is on the Flushing-bound end of the overpass.

Gray Design Associates (GDA) created a parser-based adventure game, reminiscent of the Sierra Entertainment \\"Quest\\" games (such as King's Quest) and thematically similar to Maniac Mansion. The game also features tongue-in-cheek comedy. Plot In the game, the player controls the protagonist, Hugo, who has come to a haunted house to look for his girlfriend Penelope, who hasn't been seen since she went to babysit there. The premise bears similarity to LucasFilm Games' Maniac Mansion, released in 1987, where the main character enters a mansion in order to rescue his girlfriend from a mad scientist. Gameplay The player moves Hugo around by using the arrow keys on the keyboard, and controls his actions by entering commands on the keyboard (or, in the later- released Windows version, one can use the mouse). Inspiration In an interview, the game's designer David Gray claimed that he had never played Maniac Mansion and was only aware of the game's similarities after it was released, \\"Unbelievable as it may seem, when I wrote Hugo's House of Horrors in 1989 I was completely unaware of Maniac Mansion and to this day have never played it. Why? So I can truthfully say I've never played it! The truth is that Hugo's House of Horrors was actually inspired after playing the original Sierra game Leisure Suit Larry in the Land of the Lounge Lizards and as far as game mechanics and look, Hugo should have more in common with that game\\". In another interview, David Gray also admitted to being inspired by Captain Comic by Michael Denio, stating \\"This was the first computer game I saw with large cartoon like characters that moved fluidly and I tried to emulate it.\\" He also mentioned that the Windows Point-and-Click port was inspired by Beneath a Steel Sky. Sequels In 1991 GDA released a sequel, Hugo II, Whodunit?, and in 1992 a third installment, Hugo III, Jungle of Doom!. Nitemare 3-D, a game that came out in 1994, is arguably the fourth (and so far final) installment of the Hugo series, though Nitemare 3-D, instead of being an adventure game, is a Wolfenstein 3D clone, in which Hugo ventures into the haunted mansion to rescue Penelope by shooting enemies with various guns.

Milian, the show's longest-reigning arbiter, handles small claims disputes in a simulated courtroom set. The People's Court ranks as the second-longest running courtroom series in history, behind Divorce Court and the third highest rated after Judge Judy and Hot Bench. Conception When John Masterson devised the original camera-in-court concept in 1975, he first pitched it to Monty Hall, the producer and host of the game show Let's Make a Deal, and his partner, producer-writer Stefan Hatos. They put a young associate, Stu Billett, in charge of selling it, but the networks were not interested. Billett later went out on his own and refined the concept into a show shot in a studio rather than a real courtroom. Small-claims court participants agreed to drop their court cases and accept binding arbitration in a simulated courtroom. The networks expressed interest, but still did not buy it; however, it did sell into the first-run syndication market. The series was executive produced by Ralph Edwards, who also created and hosted the documentary show This Is Your Life, and Stu Billett, who later went on to create Moral Court. John Masterson, whom many consider a pioneer and originator of \\"reality TV\\" also created Bride and Groom and Breakfast in Hollywood. The People's Court is the first court show to use binding arbitration, introducing the format into the genre in 1981. The system has been duplicated by most of the show's successors in the judicial genre. Moreover, The People's Court is the first popular, long-running reality in the judicial genre. It was preceded only by a few short-lived realities in the genre; these short-lived predecessors were only loosely related to judicial proceedings, except for one: Parole (1959) took footage from real-life courtrooms holding legal proceedings.http://tarlton.law.utexas.edu/exhibits/mason_&_associates/documents/reality_series_by_title.pdf Prior to The People's Court, the vast majority of TV courtroom shows used actors, and recreated or fictional cases (as did radio before that). Among examples of these types of court shows include Famous Jury Trials and Your Witness. The People's Court has had two incarnations. The show's first life was presided over solely by former Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge Joseph Wapner.\\"TV: 'People's Court', 'Reality' in the Morning\\", New York Times, September 8, 1981 His tenure lasted from the show's debut on September 14, 1981, until May 21, 1993, when the show was cancelled due to low ratings. This left the show with a total of 2,484 half-hour episodes and 12 seasons. The show was taped in Los Angeles during its first life. After being cancelled, reruns aired in syndication until September 9, 1994,The Intelligencer ‚Äì September 9, 1994 and on the USA Network from October 16, 1995, to June 6, 1997.The Intelligencer ‚Äì October 16, 1995The Post Standard ‚Äì June 6, 1997 On September 8, 1997, after being out of production for four years, The People's Court was revived for a second life in first-run syndication as a 60-minute program. Former lawyer and Mayor of New York Ed Koch was chosen as arbiter, which he maintained for two seasons. By the 1999‚Äì2000 season, former New York State Supreme Court Judge Jerry Sheindlin (husband of Judy Sheindlin from Judge Judy) succeeded Koch. Sheindlin only lasted one and a half seasons and was replaced towards the end of the 2000‚Äì01 season. Since spring 2001, Marilyn Milian has been the judge. First version (1981‚Äì1993) The People's Court pilot episode was taped on October 23, 1980, with a second pilot episode taped on January 13, 1981. The show debuted as a half-hour program on September 14, 1981. The judge from the show's first 12 seasons (including the 1980 pilot), was Joseph Wapner. Rusty Burrell was his bailiff,Rusty Burrell (1925‚Äì2002) was a sheriff's department court bailiff in several famous Los Angeles trials, the Manson murders, The Onion Field murder, the Patty Hearst/SLA bank robbery, and the Caryl Chessman \\"Red Light Bandit\\". Burrell had appeared on TV in the 1950s Divorce Court, and it was also his job at that show to find real attorneys to appear on camera. One of those regular Divorce Court attorneys was Judge Joseph Wapner's father. 'People's Court' Bailiff Dies 2002-04-21, zap2it.com; by Ken Kurson, 2000-08-04, Green magazine at Salon.com. Jack Harrell was the announcer, and Doug Llewelyn was the host and court reporter, who announced the matter of the dispute at the beginning of each trial. He also interviewed the plaintiff and the defendant after the court ruling, to gauge their responses to the verdict. Llewelyn often ended each episode with a jaunty \\"If you're in a dispute with another party and you can't seem to work things out, don't take the law into your own hands; you take 'em to court,\\" which became something of a 1980s catchphrase. If a case ended with a verdict for the defendant, however, Llewelyn instead ended the episode by saying, \\"If someone files a lawsuit against you and yet you're convinced you've done nothing wrong, don't be intimidated. The best policy is to go to court and stand up for your rights.\\" The cases often had pun-related names, such as \\"The Overdone Underthings\\" and \\"A Head with a Beer on It\\". Judge Wapner greeted his litigants by saying, \\"I know each of you has been sworn. I've read your complaint...\\" Occasionally, if an episode wrapped up a few minutes early, Judge Wapner fielded questions from the courtroom observers, or the legal consultant explained the legal reasons behind Wapner's decisions. The People's Court deals in small-claims matters. When the show debuted as a half-hour program on September 14, 1981, litigants could not sue for more than US$1,500, which was the limit for small-claims court at the time in California. As the laws in California changed, so did this amount. Starting in 1990, litigants could sue for up to US$5,000, which is now the law in most states. Researchers for the show examined small-claims filings in Southern California and approached the plaintiff and defendant in interesting cases. The producers offered to have Judge Wapner arbitrate the dispute if they would agree to dismiss their action and be bound by Judge Wapner's decision. Through this approach, the show could get real people with real cases. Though the show is decorated and run like a real courtroom, it is not a real court or part of any judicial system, but instead a form of binding arbitration. The losing party does not actually need to pay the judgment, as such. Instead (as is stated in the disclaimer at the end of each show), both parties are paid from a fund (set up by Ralph Edwards-Stu Billett Productions). This fund was based on the amount of the lawsuit claim, but an exact formula was not stated. The fund was to be first divided equally, then any monetary judgment ordered was subtracted from the loser's half (and presumably both halves in the case of cross judgments). Each litigant received at least what remained of their half in shows concluding with that disclaimer. The disclaimer did not call this fund an \\"appearance fee\\", a term which appeared later in connection with The People's Court and other court shows. There may have been a later period when The People's Court paid the judgment, plus expenses and only a modest appearance fee to each litigant. =Cancellation= After 12 seasons on The People's Court, Wapner was not invited back to the court show in 1993. The producers of The People's Court wished to revamp the series, but they didn't notify him of the decision, which he eventually learned of from his brother- in-law, who read about it in the San Francisco Chronicle. Wapner expressed holding great resentment and bitterness at the court show's producers for finding out this way, and additional resentment over being let go when, according to him, the show was still doing well. However, although the show had a good run ratings-wise, the ratings had dropped to an all-time low at around the time The People's Court was cancelled. Wapner stated that he was told years later that the producers did not want to hurt his feelings, but that it was exactly what they did. He also stated that he was not notified when the producers decided to revamp the series, and that he held no opinions on The People's Court judges who succeeded him as he never watched the program. He did, however, note that the two People's Court judges who succeeded him, Ed Koch and Jerry Sheindlin, only lasted two seasons each, whereas he lasted 12 seasons. He also emphasized that judges need to be respectful of litigants. Second version (1997‚Äìpresent) On September 8, 1997, a new version of The People's Court debuted in first-run syndication as a 60-minute program. The series as a whole reached its 35th season on September 9, 2019, with its 23rd season in its current production cycle. By that point, the 1997 revival has already outlasted its original version, which ran 12 seasons. The show's second life has been headed by three judges since its debut. =Ed Koch (1997‚Äì1999)= When The People's Court returned to the airwaves on September 8, 1997, the show expanded from 30 minutes to 60 minutes, where former New York newscaster Carol Martin of WCBS-TV hosted from a studio, with Harvey Levin serving as a co-host in the field taking questions, and opinions from people at the Manhattan Mall, and then, returning to the studio at the end of the show for a wrap-up. Curt Chaplin replaced Jack Harrell as the show's announcer, and appeared on camera as the court reporter, although with the addition of a host, his role was limited to interviewing the litigants after the conclusion of each case. Former New York City Mayor Ed Koch presided over the court from September 8, 1997 to June 25, 1999, with reruns airing until September 10. In 1998, Martin left the show, with Levin becoming the sole host. The studio segments were done away with and Levin hosted the entire episodes from the viewing area, which eventually moved from the Manhattan Mall to the Times Square visitors' center. Since Levin is now based in Los Angeles with TMZ, the viewing area has moved to the Third Street Promenade in Santa Monica, California, while production of The People's Court has moved to Connecticut. The opening outlines of the taped cases are shown to people in the outdoor viewing area on a monitor. Their responses are edited into the program. =Judge Jerry Sheindlin (1999 ‚Äì March 2001)= Judge Jerry Sheindlin (husband of Judge Judy Sheindlin, the presiding judge over the court show Judge Judy)Jerry and Judy Sheindlin Discuss Laying Down the Law on TV \\"KING: ... she's tough.\\" ‚Äì CNN Larry King Live transcript, aired September 12, 2000NYT 2008-01-31 Judge Judy', the longest-running and highest-rated courtroom show in syndication...\\" sat on the bench from September 13, 1999, to March 9, 2001, and ratings on the show lagged. The bailiff for both of these judges' tenures was Josephine Ann Longobardi. =Judge Marilyn Milian era (2001‚Äìpresent)= Judge Marilyn Milian took over as judge in the series in 2001. On March 12, 2001, late in The People's Courts fourth season, retired Florida State Circuit Court Judge Marilyn Milian replaced Sheindlin as presiding judge on the court show.New Judge For 'People's Court' ‚Äì 2000-12-21, Zap2it.com. Under Milian, People's Court ratings improved significantly. Milian is the first Hispanic judge to preside over a courtroom series. Milian is also the show's youngest and first female arbitrator. By the completion of the 16th season of The People's Court (2012‚Äì13), Milian had completed 12 and a half seasons presiding over the series, officially making her the longest reigning judge over the program‚Äîoutlasting Joseph Wapner's reign of 12 seasons. For the remainder of the 2000‚Äì01 season, Davey Jones took over the role as bailiff, replacing Longobardi. In September 2001, Jones was replaced by Douglas McIntosh, who remains in the position . In 2008, The People's Court, under Milian's reign, was nominated for a Daytime Emmy Award under a new Courtroom/Legal Show category created by the Academy of Television Arts & Sciences. In 2009 and 2010, the show was nominated again for the Daytime Emmy Award under the same category, but did not win. On May 1, 2013, The People's Court had again been nominated for an Outstanding Legal/Courtroom Program Daytime Emmy, but again did not win. The People's Court finally won a Daytime Emmy in 2014 and again in 2015. The show was taped in Manhattan for the first 15 seasons of the revival; since the 16th season (2012‚Äì13), it is taped in Stamford, CT. For the show's 20th season, Doug Llewelyn returned to the series for the first time since the end of the original series. He resumed his previous role as reporter, replacing Curt Chaplin, who remains in his announcer role . For his first show back, Judge Milian welcomed him \\"home\\" and handed him his suit jacket and microphone. Series overview =Opening disclaimer= When The People's Court premiered on September 14, 1981 as a half-hour show, the first opening disclaimer was used during the first five seasons of the Wapner run, and was narrated by Jack Harrell: Beginning in Season 6 (1986-1987), and ran until the end of the Wapner run on May 17, 1993, the opening disclaimer by Jack Harrell was changed: On September 8, 1997, when The People's Court returned to the airwaves, and the show expanded from 30 minutes to 60 minutes, where former New York mayor Ed Koch became the judge, the show moved to New York City, and the opening disclaimer was changed, and was narrated by Curt Chaplin: On September 13, 1999, when Jerry Sheindlin replaced Ed Koch as the judge, the opening disclaimer by Curt Chaplin was changed: When Marilyn Milian replaced Jerry Sheindlin as the current judge on March 12, 2001, the opening disclaimer was changed: Later, Milian's opening disclaimer was changed: Then, a couple years later, Milian's opening disclaimer changed again: After a few months, the soundbites of Judge Milian's voice were removed from the opening, and Curt Chaplin's opening disclaimer was slightly changed: In September 2009, the current opening disclaimer was used: During the 24th season, a new version of the disclaimer was used in honor of the COVID-19 pandemic: =Litigant compensation= At the end of each show, the following disclaimer appears: > Both the plaintiff and the defendant have been paid from a fund for their > appearance. The amount, if any, awarded in the case, is deducted from this > fund, and the remainder is divided equally between both litigants. The > amount of the fund is dependent on the size of the judgment. No information is given as to what relation the amount of the fund bears to the size of the judgment, nor the amount of the fund if a verdict for the defense is rendered. In a talk-show appearance, Judge Wapner gave a few more specifics as to how compensation was typically calculated. In his words, if the plaintiff won, the show would pay his/her judgment and give the defendant $50 for his time, whereas if the defendant won, the parties would \\"split $500\\". In 1989, a litigant sued the producers, claiming, \\"I was only willing to appear because they guaranteed me $1,500. I never would have appeared on that show and made a fool out of myself for a chintzy $250.\\" (In response, an associate producer said that before going on the show, participants are given a packet of information \\"where everything is clearly outlined to the nth degree.\\") The New York Post reported on some of the details surrounding compensation for a lawsuit filed by Claudia Evart. \\"The show pays all damages awarded to defendants and plaintiffs, as well as a $250 appearance fee.\\" Production notes When The People's Court premiered on September 14, 1981, it was taped at Golden West Broadcasters in Hollywood, California. In 1986, the show moved to Fox Television Studios in Los Angeles, which stayed until the end of the Wapner run in 1993. In 1997, the show moved to the NEP/Image studios in the former Grand Ballroom of the Hotel Pennsylvania, which was also the studio for the talk show Maury. In 1998, the show moved to the MTI Studios on the 8th floor at 401 Fifth Avenue, where the courtroom received a makeover. In 2006, the MTI Studios were sold to NEP/Image. At the end credits of some episodes, the show is said to be taped at the NEP/Image studios. The former MTI studios are officially part of NEP Broadcasting's NEP Penn Studios. In 2012, the show moved to the Connecticut Film Center in Stamford, taking advantage of the same state tax credits which attracted NBCUniversal's syndication and cable divisions to the Stamford area. The aired episodes are sometimes spliced together in a different order from which they are taped (a common procedure on some hour-long shows). This is why the judge's blouse color may change and why fewer courtroom observers may be seen during the second half of the show than during the first half. For the 2012 season, the show started broadcasting in widescreen standard definition, before eventually converting to high-definition broadcast shortly thereafter. All versions of The People's Court are \\"A Ralph Edwards-Stu Billett Production\\" in association with Telepictures Productions and distributed by Warner Bros. Domestic Television Distribution (including its predecessors Telepictures Corporation, and later Lorimar-Telepictures), all of which are now part of AT&T; Inc.'s WarnerMedia unit. =Theme music= The theme music, \\"The Big One (People's Court Theme)\\", was composed by Alan Stanley Tew. The uptempo theme music, with prominent piano theme and bongo drum rhythm, has been sampled by many artists, including Nelly. It has also been featured in several films and television shows, including the 1977 pornographic film Barbara Broadcast, the 1979 low- budget film Malibu High, the BCTV current affairs show Webster!, SpongeBob SquarePants, The Loud House, \\"Blue Harvest\\", the sixth-season premiere episode of Family Guy, the December 5, 2005, and December 21, 2009, editions of WWE Raw in Tampa, Florida, Boy Meets World, and Popular. =Season 24 (2020-2021)= When The People‚Äôs Court resumed production for Season 24 (2020-2021), the studio set up as normal. Judge Milian now appears on a video monitor. The litigants now appeared on two video monitors, which was placed on the plaintiff‚Äôs and defendant‚Äôs tables, and behind the bench. Bailiff Douglas McIntosh is present in the courtroom area to swear in the litigants, while Doug Llewellyn still conducts the post-case interviews while stationed in the corridor. Harvey Levin now appears on a video monitor. Beginning with the October 11, 2020 episode, The People's Court set reverted back to normal: the monitors on the plaintiff's and the defendant's tables were removed from the set, and the litigants no longer appear on video monitors. Harvey no longer appears on a video monitor, but is now seen outside with a microphone, Judge Milian no longer appears on a video monitor, and Doug Llewellyn still interviews the litigants. The spectators can now be seen behind the plaintiff and the defendant. Ratings As of September 2017, The People's Court ranks third behind number one Judge Judy and number two Hot Bench in the ratings for TV court shows. British version A British version of the show was produced by STV Studios (then known as \\"SMG TV Productions\\") to replace Trisha Goddard's talk show on ITV in 2005. The court reporter was Carol Smillie, the male judge was Jerome Lynch, and the female judge was Rhonda Anderson., 2006 The show was considered a failure and not renewed.

One or more files can be attached to any email message, and be sent along with it to the recipient. This is typically used as a simple method to share documents and images. A paper clip icon is the standard indicator for an attachment in an email client. History, and technical detail Originally Internet SMTP email was 7-bit ASCII text only. Text files were emailed by including them in the message body. In the mid 1980s text files could be grouped with UNIX tools such as bundleThe UNIX Programming Environment, Kernighan and Pike, 1984, p.97 and shar (shell archive)Modern versions of shar can deal with binaries, via uuencoding them, but this was not initially the case. and included in email message bodies, allowing them to be unpacked on remote UNIX systems with a single shell command. Attaching non-text files was first done in 1980 by manually encoding 8-bit files using Mary Ann Horton's uuencode, and later using BinHex or xxencode\\"How do I use UUencode/BinHex/MIME support?\\", winzip.com. and pasting the resulting text into the body of the message. When the \\"Attachment\\" user interface first appeared on PCs in cc:Mail around 1985, it used the uuencode format for SMTP transmission, as did Microsoft Mail later. Modern email systems use the MIME standard, making email attachments more utilitarian and seamless. This was developed by Nathaniel Borenstein and collaborator Ned FreedFather of the email attachment, Patrick Kingsley, The Guardian, 26 March 2012\\"The MIME guys: How two Internet gurus changed e-mail forever \\" , February 01, 2011, Jon Brodkin, Network World \\\\- with the standard being officially released as RFC2045 in 1996. With MIME, a message and all its attachments are encapsulated in a single multipart message, with base64 encoding used to convert binary into 7-bit ASCII text - or on some modern mail servers, optionally full 8-bit support via the 8BITMIME extension. Size limits Email standards such as MIME do not specify any file size limits, but in practice email users will find that they cannot successfully send very large files across the Internet. This is because of a number of potential limits: * Mail systems often arbitrarily limit the size their users are allowed to submit.\\"Setting Message Size Limits in Exchange 2010 and Exchange 2007\\"; * A message will often pass through several mail transfer agents to reach the recipient. Each of these has to store the message before forwarding it on, and may therefore also impose size limits. * The recipient mail system may reject incoming emails with attachments over a certain size. The result is that while large attachments may succeed internally within a company or organization, they may not when sending across the Internet. As an example, when Google's Gmail service increased its arbitrary limit to 25MB it warned that: \\"you may not be able to send larger attachments to contacts who use other email services with smaller attachment limits\\".\\"Google updates file size limits for Gmail and YouTube\\", geek.com.\\"Maximum attachment size\\", mail.google,com. Also note that all these size limits are based, not on the original file size, but the MIME-encoded copy. The common Base64 encoding adds about 37% to the original file size, meaning that an original 20MB file could exceed a 25MB file attachment limit. A 10MB email size limit would require that the size of the attachment files is actually limited to about 7MB. Malware A lot of malware is distributed via email attachments with some even considering such to be the main vector for cyberattacks on businesses. Users are advised to be extremely cautious with attachments and to not open any attachments that are not from a trusted source and expected ‚àí even if the sender is in their address book as their account might have been taken over or misused. While many email servers scan attachments for malware and block dangerous filetypes, this should not be relied upon ‚àí especially as such cannot detect zero-day exploits. =Dangerous file types= Email users are typically warned that unexpected email with attachments should always be considered suspicious and dangerous, particularly if not known to be sent by a trusted source. However, in practice this advice is not enough ‚Äì \\"known trusted sources\\" were the senders of executable programs creating mischief and mayhem as early as 1987 with the mainframe-based Christmas Tree EXEC. Since the ILOVEYOU and Anna Kournikova worms of 2000 and 2001, email systems have increasingly added layers of protection to prevent potential malware. Now, many block certain types of attachments.\\"Some file types are blocked\\", mail.google.com.\\"You may receive an \\"Outlook blocked access to the following potentially unsafe attachments\\" message in Outlook\\", microsoft.com.

The untransformed sample correlation coefficient is plotted on the horizontal axis, and the transformed coefficient is plotted on the vertical axis. The identity function (gray) is also shown for comparison. In statistics, the Fisher transformation (aka Fisher z-transformation) can be used to test hypotheses about the value of the population correlation coefficient œÅ between variables X and Y. This is because, when the transformation is applied to the sample correlation coefficient, the sampling distribution of the resulting variable is approximately normal, with a variance that is stable over different values of the underlying true correlation. Definition Given a set of N bivariate sample pairs (Xi, Yi), i = 1, ..., N, the sample correlation coefficient r is given by :r = \\\\frac{\\\\operatorname{cov}(X,Y)}{\\\\sigma_X \\\\sigma_Y} =\\\\frac{\\\\sum ^N _{i=1}(X_i - \\\\bar{X})(Y_i - \\\\bar{Y})}{\\\\sqrt{\\\\sum ^N _{i=1}(X_i - \\\\bar{X})^2} \\\\sqrt{\\\\sum ^N _{i=1}(Y_i - \\\\bar{Y})^2}}. Here \\\\operatorname{cov}(X,Y) stands for the covariance between the variables X and Y and \\\\sigma stands for the standard deviation of the respective variable. Fisher's z-transformation of r is defined as :z = {1 \\\\over 2}\\\\ln\\\\left({1+r \\\\over 1-r}\\\\right) = \\\\operatorname{arctanh}(r), where \\"ln\\" is the natural logarithm function and \\"arctanh\\" is the inverse hyperbolic tangent function. If (X, Y) has a bivariate normal distribution with correlation œÅ and the pairs (Xi, Yi) are independent and identically distributed, then z is approximately normally distributed with mean :{1 \\\\over 2}\\\\ln\\\\left({{1+\\\\rho} \\\\over {1-\\\\rho}}\\\\right), and standard error :{1 \\\\over \\\\sqrt{N-3}}, where N is the sample size, and œÅ is the true correlation coefficient. This transformation, and its inverse :r = \\\\frac{\\\\exp(2z)-1}{\\\\exp(2z)+1} = \\\\operatorname{tanh}(z), can be used to construct a large-sample confidence interval for r using standard normal theory and derivations. See also application to partial correlation. Derivation Fisher Transformation with \\\\rho =0.9 and N=30. Illustrated is the exact probability density function of r (in black), together with the probability density functions of the usual Fisher transformation (blue) and that obtained by including extra terms that depend on N (red). The latter approximation is visually indistinguishable from the exact answer (its maximum error is 0.3%, compared to 3.4% of basic Fisher). To derive the Fisher transformation, one starts by considering an arbitrary increasing function of r, say G(r). Finding the first term in the large-N expansion of the corresponding skewness results in :\\\\frac{6\\\\rho -3(1-\\\\rho ^{2})G^{\\\\prime \\\\prime }(\\\\rho )/G^{\\\\prime }(\\\\rho )}{\\\\sqrt{N}}+O(N^{-3/2}). Making it equal to zero and solving the corresponding differential equation for G yields the \\\\operatorname{artanh} function. Similarly expanding the mean and variance of \\\\operatorname{artanh}(r), one gets :\\\\operatorname{artanh}(\\\\rho )+\\\\frac{\\\\rho }{2N}+O(N^{-2}) and :\\\\frac{1}{N}+\\\\frac{6-\\\\rho ^{2}}{2N^{2}}+O(N^{-3}) respectively. The extra terms are not part of the usual Fisher transformation. For large values of \\\\rho and small values of N they represent a large improvement of accuracy at minimal cost, although they greatly complicate the computation of the inverse as a closed-form expression is not available. The near-constant variance of the transformation is the result of removing its skewness ‚Äì the actual improvement is achieved by the latter, not by the extra terms. Including the extra terms yields: :\\\\frac{z-\\\\operatorname{artanh}(\\\\rho )-\\\\frac{\\\\rho }{2N}}{\\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{1}{N}+\\\\frac{6-\\\\rho ^{2}}{2N^{2}}}} which has, to an excellent approximation, a standard normal distribution.  Discussion  The Fisher transformation is an approximate variance-stabilizing transformation for r when X and Y follow a bivariate normal distribution. This means that the variance of z is approximately constant for all values of the population correlation coefficient œÅ. Without the Fisher transformation, the variance of r grows smaller as œÅ gets closer to 1. Since the Fisher transformation is approximately the identity function when r < 1/2, it is sometimes useful to remember that the variance of r is well approximated by 1/N as long as œÅ is not too large and N is not too small. This is related to the fact that the asymptotic variance of r is 1 for bivariate normal data. The behavior of this transform has been extensively studied since Fisher introduced it in 1915. Fisher himself found the exact distribution of z for data from a bivariate normal distribution in 1921; Gayen in 1951 determined the exact distribution of z for data from a bivariate Type A Edgeworth distribution. Hotelling in 1953 calculated the Taylor series expressions for the moments of z and several related statistics and Hawkins in 1989 discovered the asymptotic distribution of z for data from a distribution with bounded fourth moments. Other uses While the Fisher transformation is mainly associated with the Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient for bivariate normal observations, it can also be applied to Spearman's rank correlation coefficient in more general cases. A similar result for the asymptotic distribution applies, but with a minor adjustment factor: see the latter article for details.

Originally derived from English common law, it is applied in two separate areas of the law. First, it allows institutions such as colleges and schools to act in the best interests of the students as they see fit, although not allowing what would be considered violations of the students' civil liberties. Second, this doctrine can provide a non-biological parent to be given the legal rights and responsibilities of a biological parent if they have held themselves out as the parent.An example of family law in loco parentis The in loco parentis doctrine is distinct from the doctrine of parens patriae, the psychological parent doctrine, and adoption.In Loco Parentis ‚Äì Quaqua Society Situation specific =Boarding Schools= Caretakers and management of a Boarding School have the duty of care in place of the parent. =Education= Primary and secondary education Cheadle Hulme School, founded in Manchester, England, in 1855, adopted in loco parentis as its motto, well before the world's first public education act, the Elementary Education Act 1870. The school was established to educate and care for orphans and children of distressed parents. The first major limitation to this came in the U.S. Supreme Court case West Virginia State Board of Education v. Barnette (1943), in which the court ruled that students cannot be forced to salute the American flag. More prominent change came in the 1960s and 1970s in such cases as Tinker v. Des Moines Independent Community School District (1969), when the Supreme Court decided that \\"conduct by the student, in class or out of it, which for any reason ‚Äì whether it stems from time, place, or type of behavior ‚Äì materially disrupts classwork or involves substantial disorder or invasion of the rights of others is, of course, not immunized by the constitutional guarantee of freedom of speech.\\" Adult speech is also limited by \\"time, place and manner\\" restrictions and therefore such limits do not rely on schools acting in loco parentis. In Tinker v. Des Moines Independent Community School District (1969), the Supreme Court held that for school officials to justify censoring speech, they \\"must be able to show that [their] action was caused by something more than a mere desire to avoid the discomfort and unpleasantness that always accompany an unpopular viewpoint,\\" allowing schools to forbid conduct that would \\"materially and substantially interfere with the requirements of appropriate discipline in the operation of the school.\\" The court found that the actions of the Tinkers in wearing armbands did not cause disruption and held that their activity represented constitutionally protected symbolic speech. In New Jersey v. T.L.O. (1985) Justice White wrote: The case upheld the search of a purse while on public school property based upon reasonable suspicion, indicating there is a balancing between the student's legitimate expectation of privacy and the public school's interest in maintaining order and discipline. However, in Hazelwood School District v. Kuhlmeier (1987) the Supreme Court ruled that \\"First Amendment rights of students in public schools are not automatically coextensive with the rights of adults in other settings, and must be applied in light of the special characteristics of the school environment\\" and schools may censor school-sponsored publications (such as a school newspaper) if content is \\"...inconsistent with its basic educational mission.\\" Other student issues such as school dress codes along with locker, cell phone, and personal laptop computer searches by public school officials have not yet been tested in the Supreme Court. Private institutions are given significantly more authority over their students than public ones, and are generally allowed to arbitrarily dictate rules. In the Kentucky State Supreme Court case Gott v. Berea College (1913), it was upheld that a \\"college or university may prescribe requirements for admission and rules for the conduct of its students, and one who enters as a student implicitly agrees to conform to such rules of government\\", while publicly funded institutions could not claim the same ability. In Morse v. Frederick (2007) Justice Clarence Thomas, concurring with the majority, argued that Tinker's ruling contradicted \\"the traditional understanding of the judiciary's role in relation to public schooling,\\" and ignored the history of public education.127 S.Ct. 2634 He believed the judiciary's role to determine whether students have freedom of expression was limited by in loco parentis. He cited Lander v. Seaver (1859), which held that in loco parentis allowed schools to punish student expression that the school or teacher believed contradicted the school's interests and educational goals. This ruling declared that the only restriction the doctrine imposed were acts of legal malice or acts that caused permanent injury. Neither of these were the case with Tinker. Higher education Though in loco parentis continues to apply to primary and secondary education in the U.S., application of the concept has largely disappeared in higher education. This was not always the case. Prior to the 1960s, undergraduates were subject to many restrictions on their private lives. Women were generally subject to curfews as early as 10 pm, and dormitories were sex-segregated. Some universities expelled students‚Äîespecially female students‚Äîwho were deemed \\"morally\\" undesirable. More importantly, universities saw fit to restrict freedom of speech, on campus, often forbidding organizations out of favor or with different views from speaking, organizing, demonstrating, or otherwise acting on campus. These restrictions were severely criticized by the student movements of the 1960s, and the Free Speech Movement at the University of California, Berkeley formed partly on account of them, inspiring students elsewhere to step up their opposition. The landmark 1961 case Dixon v. Alabama was the beginning of the end for in loco parentis in U.S. higher education. The United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit found that Alabama State College could not summarily expel students without due process. However, that still does not prevent students who exercise their rights from being subject to legal action for violation of institutional rules. =Hospital and nursing homes= Caregivers and management have the duty of care in place of the parent. Country specific =India= Indian law has provision for in loco parentis. Under Indian law non-human entities such as animals, trusts (including those established for estate planning), charitable organizations, corporations, managing bodies, etc. and several other non-human entitles have been given the status of \\"legal person\\" with legal rights and duties, such as to sue and be sued, to own and transfer the property, to pay taxes, etc. In court cases regarding animals, the animals have the status of \\"legal person\\" and humans have the legal duty to act as \\"loco parentis\\" towards animals welfare like a parent has towards the minor children. In a case of cow- smuggling, the Punjab and Haryana High Court mandated that \\"entire animal kingdom including avian and aquatic\\" species has a \\"distinct legal persona with corresponding rights, duties, and liabilities of a living person\\" and humans are \\"loco parentis\\" while laying out the norms for animal welfare, veterinary treatment, fodder and shelter, e.g. animal drawn carriages must not have more than four humans, and load carrying animals must not be loaded beyond the specified limits and those limits must be halved when animals have to carry the load up a slope.Birds to holy rivers: A list of everything India considers ‚Äúlegal persons‚Äù, Quartz (publication), September 2019. =UK= =USA= See also * Locum * Next friend * Babysitting References External links * Conrath, Richard Cranmer.

It is served by the 7 train, with additional peak-direction <7> service during rush hours. History 61st Street‚ÄìWoodside opened on April 21, 1917 as Woodside, as part of an extension of the IRT Flushing Line to Alburtis Avenue (now 103rd Street‚ÄìCorona Plaza). The Long Island Rail Road station predates the station, as it originally opened in 1869. The platforms at 61st Street were extended in 1955‚Äì1956 to accommodate 11-car trains. In 1981, the MTA listed the station among the 69 most deteriorated stations in the subway system. As part of the 2015‚Äì2019 Capital Program, the MTA would renovate the 52nd, 61st, 69th, 82nd, 103rd and 111th Streets stations, a project that has been delayed for several years but is slated to begin in mid-2020. Conditions at these stations were among the worst of all stations in the subway system. Station layout This station has two island platforms and three tracks. The two outer tracks are used for the full-time local service while the bidirectional center track is used for rush hour peak-direction <7> express service. There is a mezzanine located at the center, underneath the platforms, with an ADA-accessible elevator to each platform, as well as another to each Long Island Rail Road platform. The elevator from the mezzanine to the street stops at the LIRR's eastbound Main Line platform. Artwork includes John Cavanagh's Commuting/Community (1986), located near the stairway down to LIRR Track 4, and Dimitri Gerakaris' Woodside Continuum (1999), which forms part of the steel-grating fare-control separation. =Exits= Entrance and exit are provided by long stairs down to street level on the northern curb of Roosevelt Avenue at 61st Street, as well as to other nearby locations via the LIRR platforms. An ADA-compliant elevator provides access to street level at the northeast corner of 61st Street and Roosevelt Avenue, while a long escalator at the southeast corner provides entrance only. The Woodside station of the Long Island Rail Road is located directly beneath the Flushing Line station; any of the three LIRR platforms can be accessed directly from the mezzanine. In popular culture This station was used for a scene in John Cassavetes's 1980 film Gloria. The station was depicted in a scene in the Coen brothers' 2013 film Inside Llewyn Davis, though actual filming occurred elsewhere.

It is one of the world's largest yachts. Launched in 2003, Octopus is a private vessel that is regularly lent out for exploration projects, scientific research initiatives and rescue missions.  Description  Octopus in Barbados, December 2, 2006 Octopus in Antibes Port Vauban, in 2009 Octupus in Hamburg, August 1, 2019 Octopus has two helicopter pads on the main deck, a twin pad and hangars at the stern and a single pad on the bow; and a tender docked in the transom and a landing craft. There are a total of seven tenders aboard. The yacht also has a pool, located aft on one of its upper decks, and two submarines (one of them operated by remote control and capable of attaining greater depths). The latter was lent to Google Earth for the \\"Explore the Ocean\\" project. Side hatches at the water line form a dock for personal watercraft. The exterior was designed by Espen √òino Naval Architects and built by the German shipbuilders L√ºrssen in Bremen and Howaldtswerke-Deutsche Werft in Kiel. The interior was by designer Jonathan Quinn Barnett of Seattle.  History  Octopus was built in 2003 and refitted in 2008. Allen loaned Octopus, which is equipped with a submarine and ROV, for a variety of rescue and research operations. These include assisting in a hunt for an American pilot and two officers whose plane disappeared off Palau, and loaning his yacht to scientists to study the coelacanth, a \\"living fossil\\" that was once believed to be extinct. In January 2011, while en route to Antarctica, one of its helicopters was forced to make an emergency landing in the waters off the coast of Argentina. While the helicopter was severely damaged, there was no loss of life, with only the co-pilot suffering minor injuries. Allen was not aboard at the time. In 2012, he loaned the ship to the Royal Navy in their attempt to retrieve the ship's bell from the , which sank to a depth of in the Denmark Strait during World War II, as a national memorial. HMS Hood was hit by a shell from the ; its magazines exploded and the ship sank in minutes with a loss of over 1,400 lives. The bell was located but not recovered, due to adverse weather conditions. On August 7, 2015 it was announced that the bell from HMS Hood had been recovered by the ROV operating from Octopus. After conservation, the bell was put on display in 2016 at the National Museum of the Royal Navy, Portsmouth. In March 2015, an Allen-led research team announced that it had found the Japanese battleship in the Sibuyan Sea off the coast of the Philippines. Armed with main guns and displacing 72,800 tonnes (74,000 tons) at full load, Musashi and its sister ship were the largest and most heavily armed battleships in naval history. From 2018 to July 2019, the yacht underwent a refit at Blohm+Voss and is reportedly for sale with an asking price of ‚Ç¨295,000,000. In October 2019, the estate of Paul Allen, announced that the yacht would be up for sale for $325 million. It was not announced if the sale went through.

It is served by the 7 and N trains at all times; the W train on weekdays; and the <7> train rush hours in the peak direction. Queensboro Plaza was originally built in 1916-1917 as part of the Dual Contracts between the Brooklyn-Manhattan Transit Corporation (BMT) and the Interborough Rapid Transit Company (IRT). The station initially had eight tracks to allow BMT and IRT passengers to transfer between the Astoria, Flushing, and Second Avenue elevated lines. The northern section of the station was torn down in the late 1940s, and Queensboro Plaza now contains only four tracks: two each for the IRT Flushing Line () and the BMT Astoria Line ().Today, Queensboro Plaza is the only station in the entire system to provide cross-platform transfers between \\"A\\" Division () and \\"B\\" Division () trains. While the station is near the Queens Plaza underground subway station, which serves the IND Queens Boulevard Line, the two stations are separate and do not allow free transfers.  History  From a 1913 book Former and current track configurations A train of R40M cars begins its descent into the 60th Street Tunnel, passing through the structure leading to the now-demolished northern (BMT) platforms. In the original configuration, the station had eight tracks and four tracks per each level. Originally, the IRT used both sides of the current platforms, and the BMT used now-demolished platforms north of the current platforms, also double-decked. The south side of the IRT platforms was used by the Flushing Line, as today; the north side was used by Astoria trains, but instead of going through the 60th Street Tunnel, they went over the Queensboro Bridge to the elevated IRT Second Avenue Line. Double crossovers south (lower tracks) and north (upper tracks) of the platforms allowed trains from either side to switch to the other line after leaving the station. At the BMT half, the south track served subway trains to Manhattan and the BMT Broadway Line. Trains came from Manhattan on the upper level, continued north to a merge with the lower level, and then returned via the lower level. This configuration was in place by 1924; before that trains reversed direction using a double crossover south of the platforms. Until October 17, 1949, the Astoria and Flushing Lines hosted both IRT and BMT service. Since the platforms were IRT-size, the BMT used its own elevated cars to provide service on the lines, with a required transfer at Queensboro Plaza. Shuttles from Astoria came in on the west side lower track and then reversed direction to head to Flushing; Flushing trains came in on the upper track and reversed direction towards Astoria. During the early period of dual service on the Astoria and Flushing portions, IRT and BMT trains had their own stopping marks on the platforms and the sections of the platforms were separated. Passengers had separate entrances to the platforms depending on which service they wanted. This set-up prevented free transfers between the trains of the two companies. This arrangement had to end when the IRT lengthened trains. The two companies worked out an agreement in which the revenue collected on those stations was shared. In 1942, the IRT Second Avenue Line closed, and the upper portion of the north side was abandoned. On October 17, 1949, the $1.375 million renovation of the station was completed which allowed the rerouting of trains between Manhattan and Queens. As part of the project, the Astoria Line platforms were shaved back to allow BMT service to operate through to 60th Street, and new connections were built between the 60th Street Tunnel approach and the west tracks at the east (former IRT) platforms, and the west (former BMT) platforms were closed. Once the project was completed, the IRT started using the Flushing Line only and the BMT started using the Astoria Line only. With the station's renovation, it became easier for passengers to transfer between the IRT and BMT lines. Instead of having to climb between the upper and lower level platforms, passengers were able to use cross-platform transfers. There was a crossover just west of the station which allowed the Astoria trains to access the Steinway tunnels. This was removed directly after the joint operation ceased in 1949. Much of the mezzanine was rebuilt as part of the project, including the pedestrian bridges leading to either side of Queens Plaza. On the north side of the lower level, a new window wall was constructed. In 1964, the abandoned northern half of the Queensboro Plaza station was demolished. One set of crossovers remains on the upper level as the Flushing Line's only connection to the rest of the system. This connection is used for non-revenue moves, specifically to transfer subway cars to the Coney Island Shops for repairs, to transfer new cars to the Flushing Line, or to move rolling stock to or from the Flushing line. In 1981, the MTA listed the station among the 69 most deteriorated stations in the subway system. This station was renovated in the late 1990s, and the contract for the project's design was awarded in May 1994. In 2018, it was announced that the Queensboro Plaza station may receive elevators as part of a process to expand the New York City Subway system's accessibility.  Station layout  Lower-level platform This two-level station has two island platforms (one on each level) and four tracks. It stands over the south (railroad east) side of the roadway, but formerly spanned the whole plaza. Trains running into Queens stop on the upper level and Manhattan-bound trains below. On both levels, the BMT Astoria Line (which to the south joins with the 60th Street Tunnel Connection and heads through the 60th Street Tunnel to the BMT Broadway Line) uses the north track and the IRT Flushing Line uses the south track. , the station is being renovated by NYCTA employees (as opposed to an outside contractor). A computer assisted tower is being installed on the south end, as part of the IRT Flushing Line automation. =Exits= The station's only exits are through a mezzanine located below the lower level (and formerly connected to the now torn-down BMT platforms to the west). From the mezzanine, there is a concrete ramp across Queens Plaza North to the second floor of a building. There is also an overpass leading to Queens Plaza South.  In popular culture  A poster describing the changes at Queensboro Plaza in 1949 Queensboro Plaza is featured in a defining moment in the film Beneath the Planet of the Apes. The protagonist astronaut (\\"Brent\\") unknowingly enters the ruins of an underground station; upon seeing the words \\"Queensboro Plaza\\" in tiles, and finding an advertisement for the New York Summer Festival, he realizes that he is indeed on Earth and not another planet, and that New York City has been destroyed in a nuclear war. In reality, Queensboro Plaza is an elevated station and has no tilework. The station is also featured in the Seinfeld episode entitled \\"The Cigar Store Indian\\", as the location of a renowned gyro stall, and again incorrectly depicted as an underground station, on an IRT Lexington Avenue Line train. The station and nearby MetLife Plaza were a regular CG composite as location shots between scenes in ABC series Ugly Betty. The station also appears briefly in the season 2 opening sequence of HBO political drama The Newsroom. The station is also shown in the TV show The King of Queenss theme song, which shows a Redbird 7 train entering the station's upper level. The station also appears on Sesame Street in a looking for triangles film with Maria (Sonia Manzano).

Between 1933 and 1936, he was the leader of that province's Conservative Party caucus. Evans was born in Spencerville, Ontario, the son of Rev. J.S. Evans and Mary Jane Vaux. He was educated at the Collegiate Institute in Hamilton, Ontario, Victoria University and Columbia University. He subsequently moved to Manitoba. Evans was active in the publishing industry of his new province, founding the Winnipeg Telegram and writing a book on Canadian Imperialism during the Second Boer War. In 1920, he co-founded a publishing firm specializing in grain industry news. He married Mary Irene Gurney, a noted pianist, in 1900. Evans ran for the federal Conservatives in Winnipeg in 1904, but was defeated by Liberal David Bole. He was elected Mayor of Winnipeg, Manitoba in 1909, and served in that position until 1911. Evans was first elected to the Manitoba legislature in 1922, leading the Conservative party list in Winnipeg (which elected ten MLAs through preferential balloting). He was re-elected in 1927 and 1932, topping the Winnipeg ballot on the latter occasion. Evans was chosen as Conservative party parliamentary leader following the resignation of Col. Fawcett Taylor in 1933. He did not run against Errick F. Willis for the party leadership in 1936 and did not run for reelection in the provincial election which followed. In 1931, while still serving in the Manitoba legislature, Evans was appointed by British Columbia Premier Simon F. Tolmie to head a commission investigating that province's fruit-growing cooperatives. The commission's report recommended a return to open competition and was opposed by many within the industry. He was president of the first Canadian Club, formed in Hamilton, and helped form the Canadian Club of Winnipeg, also serving as its president. Evans continued to publish grain industry news following his retirement from parliament. He died in 1949. Notably, Evans's brother Harry M.E. Evans served as Mayor of Edmonton, Alberta. As well, Evans's son Gurney Evans served as a cabinet minister in the governments of Dufferin Roblin and Walter Weir in Manitoba.

The performance itself would be the first formal concert played by Thayil since the demise of Soundgarden a few years beforehand, and only the second time Biafra had played music in a planned live setting since Dead Kennedys split in 1986.He had done one live show with his post-Kennedys project Lard in 1990, and assorted impromptu guest spots with Ministry, D.O.A., and other bands since 1987.

International units are used to quantify vitamins, hormones, some medications, vaccines, blood products, and similar biologically active substances. The name international unit has often been capitalized (in English and other languages), although major English-language dictionaries treat it as a common noun and thus use lower case. The name has several accepted abbreviations. It is usually abbreviated as IU in English, and UI in Romance languages (for example Spanish unidad internacional, French unit√© internationale, Italian unit√† internazionale, Romanian unitate interna»õionalƒÉ), IE in several Germanic languages (for example German internationale Einheit, Dutch internationale eenheid) or as other forms (for example Russian –ú–ï, –º–µ–∂–¥—É–Ω–∞—Ä–æ–¥–Ω–∞—è –µ–¥–∏–Ω–∏—Ü–∞ [mezhdunarodnaya yedinitsa], Hungarian NE, nemzetk√∂zi egys√©g). In order to remove the possibility of having the letter \\"I\\" confused with the digit \\"1\\", some hospitals have it as a stated policy omit the \\"I\\", that is, to only use U or E when talking and writing about dosages, while other hospitals require the word \\"units\\" (or words \\"international units\\") to be written out entirely. (For example, \\"three international units per litre\\" may be abbreviated \\"3 U/l\\". The fact that in the SI - Syst√®me International - convention the abbreviation for 'litre' or 'litres' is lower case 'l' introduces another potential source of confusion in many fonts between the letters \\"I\\" and 'l' and the digit \\"1\\".) Many biological agents exist in different forms or preparations (e.g. vitamin A in the form of retinol or beta-carotene). The goal of the IU is to be able to compare these, so that different forms or preparations with the same biological effect will contain the same number of IUs. To do so, the WHO Expert Committee on Biological Standardization provides a reference preparation of the agent, arbitrarily sets the number of IUs contained in that preparation, and specifies a biological procedure to compare other preparations of the same agent to the reference preparation. Since the number of IUs contained in a new substance is arbitrarily set, there is no equivalence between IU measurements of different biological agents. For instance, one IU of vitamin E cannot be equated with one IU of vitamin A in any way, including mass or efficacy. Despite its name, IU is not part of the International System of Units used in physics and chemistry. The IU should not be confused with the enzyme unit, also known as the international unit of enzyme activity and abbreviated as U. Equality and equivalency of IU for different substances To define the IU for a substance, an international collaborative study is organized by the WHO Expert Committee on Biological Standardization using various assay systems in several laboratories. The main goal of the study is to reach a consensus regarding methods of analysis and the approach to standardization so that results can be compared. The study is performed using highly purified preparations of the substance, typically in lyophilized form, called \\"international reference preparations\\" or IRPs. Each preparation is divided into precisely weighed samples, with each sample stored in its own ampoule labeled with a code corresponding to the source IRP. Assays are performed using these samples and are calibrated against the previously available IU standard. These results can be quite variable; the final IU value for samples of a given IRP are determined by consensus. The IRP that provides the best results and shows the best long term stability is selected to define the next IU. This IRP is then referred to as the \\"international standard.\\" Mass equivalents of 1 IU For some substances, the precise mass equivalent of one IU has been changed. When that happens, the former IU mass for that substance is officially abandoned in favor of a newly established mass. Such a change has happened with the immunoassay standards for prolactin: as one batch of standard (84/500; 53 mIU ‚âà 2.5 Œºg) was running out of stock, a new standard (83/573; 67 mIU ‚âà 3.2 Œºg) was calibrated against the old one (as 67.2 mIU) and replaced the former. * Vitamin A: 1 IU is the biological equivalent of 0.3 Œºg retinol, or of 0.6 Œºg beta-caroteneDietary Supplements Ingredient Database Dietary Reference Intakes Tables: Unit Conversion Factors * Vitamin C: 1 IU is 50 Œºg L-ascorbic acid * Vitamin D: The biological activity of 40 IU is equal to 1 Œºg * Vitamin E: 1 IU is the biological equivalent of about 0.667 mg d-alpha-tocopherol (2/3 mg exactly), or of 0.90 mg of dl-alpha-tocopherol * Insulin: 1 IU is equivalent to 0.0347 mg of human insulin (28.8 IU/mg) * Oxytocin: 1 IU is equivalent to 1.68 Œºg of pure peptidehttps://www.nibsc.org/documents/ifu/76-575.pdf See also * United States Pharmacopeia (USP) References =Notes= =Citations= External links * WHO reference preparations * Online converter with authoritative references for all substances Category:Units of measurement Category:Dosage forms ","title":"International unit"},{"id":"865804","text":"The Liberal Party of Sri Lanka ( Libaral Pakshaya; ) began as a think-tank called the Council for Liberal Democracy, founded in 1981 by the late Chanaka Amaratunga, a longstanding member of the United National Party which was then in government.

Though the Party never established itself as an electoral success, given the need in Sri Lanka for small parties to ally themselves with larger groupings that tend to swamp their individual identity, it has continued to have an impact as a think-tank. It contributed seminally to the manifestoes put forward by Sirimavo Bandaranaike and Gamini Dissanayake as presidential candidates in 1988 and in 1994. In 1996 Dr. Amaratunga died in a car accident, which led to a reduction in party activity since.

She currently serves as a member on the board of directors for both Delta Air Lines and Mueller Water Products. The 58th mayor of Atlanta, she was the first woman to hold the post and the first black woman to be elected mayor of a major Southern city.Sharon Pratt Kelly (formerly Sharon Pratt Dixon) was sworn in as mayor of Washington, D.C. on January 2, 1991, the first African-American woman to serve as mayor of a major American city. Washington, D.C. is also considered to be a southern city as it lies south of the Mason‚ÄìDixon Line.The Biography of Mayor Shirley Franklin Franklin was Atlanta's fourth African-American mayor. In July 2009, Mayor Franklin (along with Frances Townsend and Judge William H. Webster) was appointed to an ad hoc Department of Homeland Security special task force for 60-day review of the Homeland Security Advisory System. Family Franklin had a son named Cabral. He died in 2015. According to a DNA analysis, Franklin is descended, mainly, from people of Guinea-Bissau and Sierra Leone.http://www.prweb.com/releases/2008/11/prweb1673564.htm Growing Interest in DNA-Based Genetic Testing Among African American with Historic Election of President Elect Barack Obama Education Originally from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, she is a graduate of the Philadelphia High School for Girls. Franklin received her B.A. in sociology from Howard University and her M.A., also in sociology, from the University of Pennsylvania. She is an Honorary member of Delta Sigma Theta sorority. Political life Franklin served as the Commissioner of Cultural Affairs under Mayor Maynard Jackson. Subsequently, she was named Chief Administrative Officer and City Manager under Mayor Andrew Young. Her 2001 run for mayor was her first run for public office. She won, succeeding Mayor Bill Campbell after winning 50 percent of the vote, defeating several candidates including Democrat Rob Pitts (33 percent). Facing a massive and unexpected budget deficit, Franklin slashed the number of government employees and increased taxes to balance the budget as quickly as possible. Franklin made repairing the Atlanta sewer system a main focus of her office. Prior to Franklin's term, Atlanta's combined sewer system violated the federal Clean Water Act and burdened the city government with fines from the Environmental Protection Agency. In 2002, Franklin announced an initiative called \\"Clean Water Atlanta\\" to address the problem and begin improving the city's sewer system. She has been lauded for efforts to make the City of Atlanta \\"green.\\" Under Franklin's leadership Atlanta has gone from having one of the lowest percentages of LEED certified buildings to one of the highest. In 2005, TIME Magazine named Franklin one of the five best big-city American mayors. In October of that same year, she was included in the U.S. News & World Report \\"Best Leaders of 2005\\" issue. With solid popular support and strong backing from the business sector, Franklin was reelected Atlanta Mayor in 2005, garnering more than 90 percent of the vote. Her popularity led to increased speculation that she may be a viable contender for a future Georgia governor's race. In February 2006, The White House Project named Shirley Franklin one of its \\"8 in '08\\", a group of eight female politicians who could possibly run and/or be elected president in 2008. She was the only person on the list to not be a governor, senator or presidential cabinet member, and one of two African-American women on the list; the other was United States Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice. In 2006, Shirley Franklin led the effort to have the papers of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. given to his alma mater, Morehouse College, instead of being sold at auction: \\"I never imagined I could contribute to the continuation of Dr. King's legacy in as a significant way. And I'm really humbled I was able to do anything to continue his legacy.\\" Franklin is a member of the Mayors Against Illegal Guns Coalition, Retrieved on June 12, 2007 an organization formed in 2006 and co- chaired by New York City mayor Michael Bloomberg and Boston mayor Thomas Menino. She was 2007/08 President of the National Conference of Democratic Mayors. In 2008, facing a major deficit, Mayor Franklin asked the Atlanta City Council to approve a property tax increase, to avoid public safety cuts. The Atlanta City Council unanimously shot down the measure, which would have caused the average city homeowner to pay an estimated extra $30 in property taxes under Franklin's plan. As Mayor Franklin warned, without the tax increase, layoffs and pay cuts of Atlanta public safety officials would be imminent. According to the Atlanta Journal Constitution, in December 2008 Franklin announced that 222 city workers would lose their jobs to help fill a projected $50 million to $60 million budget shortfall. Most remaining city workers, including firefighters, will work fewer hours and suffer a pay cut as part of the budget cuts. Mayor Shirley Franklin has said that the deficits in the city of Atlanta are not because of excess city spending. In fact, according to the Atlanta Business Chronicle city spending actually ran slightly below budgeted amounts through the first quarter of the fiscal year that began in July. According to Mayor Shirley Franklin, city tax collections are down by more than 12 percent because of the economic downturn. However, basic accounting mistakes in the city budget also played a significant role in the budget crisis. Franklin, Philadelphia's Michael Nutter and Phil Gordon of Phoenix lobbied Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson in a joint letter asking for a share of the proposed $700 billion bailout. Honors Mayor Franklin was the recipient of Profile in Courage Award in 2005, issued by the John F. Kennedy Library Foundation. The foundation praised her management of the city of Atlanta during the critical period of enormous deficit and loss of public confidence in government following the corrupt administration of Mayor Bill Campbell.Shirley Franklin In 2007, she received an honorary degree in Doctor of Humane Letters from Oglethorpe University.

Ildjarn recorded music until 1997 but did not officially end until 2005. The man behind Ildjarn was Vidar Vaaer, although some releases were collaborations with a musician known as Nidhogg. History The band was formed in 1991. The band's music was a very raw, fast, simple and lo-fi brand of black metal, with most songs composed of basic drum patterns, a couple of riffs, and unintelligible vocals. The band's style has been compared to hardcore punk in its simplistic ferocity and short song lengths. Two Ildjarn albums were made entirely on a synthesizer. Of all the released music, the only Ildjarn song to have its lyrics published was \\"Eksistensens Jeger\\", from the self-titled Ildjarn-Nidhogg (2003) compilation. In 2006, the band website stated that no more news would be printed, leading to the conclusion that Ildjarn had ended. The title of Ildjarn's 2005 release, Ildjarn is Dead, further supports this conclusion. Part of Vidar Vaaer's motivation for ending Ildjarn was due to his 4-track recorder breaking (the same 4-track recorder used during Emperor's early days as Thou Shalt Suffer). Related bands The related band Sort Vokter consisted of Ildjarn, Nidhogg and two other members known as Tvigygre and Heiinghund. They released only one album called Folkloric Necro Metal.

It was founded in 1954 by Dick Spady and others. It currently operates seven locations in the Puget Sound region. History Dick's original location in Wallingford on a summer night. Founders Dick Spady, H. Warren Ghormley, and Dr. B. O. A. Thomas opened the first Dick's on January 28, 1954, in Seattle's Wallingford neighborhood, on N.E. 45th Street. A grand opening was held on February 20, 1954. In 1955, a second Dick's was opened in Seattle's Capitol Hill district. This was followed by a third in 1960 in the Crown Hill neighborhood, a 4th in 1963 in Lake City, a fifth in Queen Anne in 1974. All but the Queen Anne location are without customer seating. The Queen Anne location has indoor tables and no drive-in. The simple menu has changed little over time. It features fast-food staples such as hamburgers, hand-cut french fries, and individually made milkshakes. Dick's is particularly well known for the \\"Dick's Deluxe,\\" which includes lettuce, mayonnaise, and chopped pickles. No substitutions are allowed and all burgers are cooked to well done. For most of Dick's history, the only available omissions were the Deluxe without cheese or fries without salt. More recent menu changes, however, allow ordering plain versions of the hamburger and cheeseburger. For several years Dick's has offered employee benefits such as a matched 401(k), 100% employer-paid medical insurance, and a $22,000 college tuition scholarship after six months of work. In 2013, Dick's Drive-In was voted \\"the most life-changing burger joint in America\\" in an Esquire.com poll. In September 2010, it was announced that Dick's was planning on opening a new sixth location in the Seattle area and that an online poll on their website would determine the new location. After a few weeks of polling, the area north of Seattle won the right for a new Dick's Drive-In. On October 15, 2010, Dick's officials announced the new location to be in Edmonds on the corner of Hwy 99 and 220th St. On October 20, 2011, the 6th location in Edmonds opened to the public. The opening occurred multiple weeks ahead of schedule. In 2017, Dick's launched another poll to determine its seventh location, which would be located either on the Eastside or in South King County. Over 177,000 participants cast their votes, with the majority favoring the South region. Locations being considered included Kent, West Seattle, South Seattle, Renton, Burien, SeaTac, Tukwila, Auburn, Normandy Park, Des Moines and Federal Way. After an extensive amount of time, it was announced on September 7, 2017 that the 7th location to the chain would be located in Kent on Highway 99, south of Sea-Tac Airport. The location opened on December 12, 2018. In September 2020, Dick's announced that it would launch a food truck to serve five locations in Western Washington that were chosen through a public poll: Bellevue, Bellingham, Everett, Renton, and West Seattle. The restaurant also announced that it would be expanding to the Eastside once a suitable location is found. A collaboration with local chef Edouardo Jordan of Salare and JuneBaby was also announced with a three-day popup event at the Queen Anne location.

The Treaty of Brest-Litovsk, dictated by Germany ended hostilities between Russia and Germany; it was signed on March 3, 1918.Full text in English: The Peace Treaty of Brest-Litovsk; March 3, 1918 A few months later, the German ambassador to Moscow, Wilhelm von Mirbach, was shot dead by Russian Left Socialist-Revolutionaries in an attempt to incite a new war between Russia and Germany. The entire Soviet embassy under Adolph Joffe was deported from Germany on November 6, 1918, for their active support of the German Revolution. Karl Radek also illegally supported communist subversive activities in Weimar Germany in 1919. From the outset, both states sought to overthrow the system that was established by the victors of World War I. Germany, laboring under onerous reparations and stung by the collective responsibility provisions of the Treaty of Versailles, was a defeated nation in turmoil. This and the Russian Civil War made both Germany and the Soviets into international outcasts, and their resulting rapprochement during the interbellum was a natural convergence.Gasiorowski, Zygmunt J.

Soviet Studies 30 (2), 212‚Äì236. At the same time, the dynamics of their relationship was shaped by both a lack of trust and the respective governments' fears of its partner's breaking out of diplomatic isolation and turning towards the French Third Republic (which at the time was thought to possess the greatest military strength in Europe) and the Second Polish Republic, its ally. The countries' economic relationship dwindled in 1933, when Adolf Hitler came to power and created Nazi Germany. However, the relationships restarted in the end of 1930s, culminating with the Molotov‚ÄìRibbentrop Pact of 1939 and several trade agreements. Few questions concerning the origins of the Second World War are more controversial and ideologically loaded than the issue of the policies of the Soviet Union under Joseph Stalin towards Nazi Germany between the Nazi seizure of power and the German invasion of the USSR on June 22, 1941.Haslam, Jonathan (1997). \\"Soviet- German Relations and the Origins of the Second World War: The Jury Is Still Out\\". The Journal of Modern History 69: 785‚Äì797. A variety of competing and contradictory theses exist, including: that the Soviet leadership actively sought another great war in Europe to further weaken the capitalist nations;Raack, R. C. Stalin's Drive to the West, 1938‚Äì1945: The Origins of the Cold War. Stanford, California, 1995, p. 12. that the USSR pursued a purely defensive policy;Geoffrey Roberts, The Soviet Union and the Origins of the Second World War: Russo-German Relations and the Road to War 1933‚Äì1941 (New York, 1995), p. 73. or that the USSR tried to avoid becoming entangled in a war, both because Soviet leaders did not feel that they had the military capabilities to conduct strategic operations at that time,Haslam, Jonathan.

New York, 1985, pp. 140‚Äì41. and to avoid, in paraphrasing Stalin's words to the 18th Party Congress on March 10, 1939, \\"pulling other nations' (the UK and France's) chestnuts out of the fire.\\"Lukacs, John, June 1941: Hitler and Stalin, Yale University Press, 2006. German and Soviet troops shaking hands following the invasion of Poland in September 1939. Soviet Russia and Weimar Germany = Revolution, end of World War I = German and Soviet troops fraternizing in the area of the Yaselda River, February 1918 Treaty of Rapallo, Joseph Wirth with Leonid Krasin, Georgy Chicherin and Adolf Joffe, 1922 The outcome of the First World War was disastrous for both German Reich and Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic. During the war, the Bolsheviks struggled for survival, and Vladimir Lenin had no option except recognize the independence of Finland, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, and Ukraine. Moreover, facing a German military advance, Lenin and Leon Trotsky were forced to enter into the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk,Text of the 3 March, 1918 Peace Treaty of Brest-Litovsk which ceded large swathes of western Russian territory to the German Empire. On 11 November 1918, the Germans signed armistice with the Allies, ending the First World War on the Western Front. After Germany's collapse, British, French and Japanese troops intervened in the Russian Civil War.Montefiore 2005, p. 32 Initially, the Soviet leadership hoped for a successful socialist revolution in Germany as part of the \\"world revolution\\". However, the revolution was put down by the right-wing freikorps. Subsequently, the Bolsheviks became embroiled in the Soviet war with Poland of 1919‚Äì20. Because Poland was a traditional enemy of Germany (see e.g. Silesian Uprisings), and because the Soviet state was also isolated internationally, the Soviet government began to seek a closer relationship with Germany and therefore adopted a much less hostile attitude towards Germany. This line was consistently pursued under People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs Georgy Chicherin and Soviet Ambassador Nikolay Krestinsky. Other Soviet representatives instrumental in the negotiations were Karl Radek, Leonid Krasin, Christian Rakovsky, Victor Kopp and Adolph Joffe.Kochan, Lionel (1950). The Russian Road to Rapallo. Soviet Studies 2 (2), 109‚Äì122. In the 1920s, many in the leadership of Weimar Germany, who felt humiliated by the conditions that the Treaty of Versailles had imposed after their defeat in the First World War (especially General Hans von Seeckt, chief of the Reichswehr), were interested in cooperation with the Soviet Union, both in order to avert any threat from the Second Polish Republic, backed by the French Third Republic, and to prevent any possible Soviet-British alliance. The specific German aims were the full rearmament of the Reichswehr, which was explicitly prohibited by the Treaty of Versailles, and an alliance against Poland. It is unknown exactly when the first contacts between von Seeckt and the Soviets took place, but it could have been as early as 1919‚Äì1921, or possibly even before the signing of the Treaty of Versailles.Smith, Arthur L. (1956). The German General Staff and Russia, 1919‚Äì1926. Soviet Studies 8 (2), 125‚Äì133.Hallgarten, George W. F. (1949) General Hans von Seeckt and Russia, 1920‚Äì1922. The Journal of Modern History 21 (1), 28‚Äì34. On April 16, 1920, Victor Kopp, the RSFSR's special representative to Berlin, asked at the German Foreign Office whether \\"there was any possibility of combining the German and the Red Army for a joint war on Poland\\".John Erickson, ed., The Soviet High Command: A Military-Political History, 1918‚Äì1941, 3rd ed. (London, England: Frank Cass Publishers, 2001), p. 148. This was yet another event at the start of military cooperation between the two countries, which ended before the German invasion of the Soviet Union on June 22, 1941. By early 1921, a special group in the Reichswehr Ministry devoted to Soviet affairs, Sondergruppe R, had been created.Gatzke, Hans W. (1958). Russo-German Military Collaboration during the Weimar Republic. The American Historical Review 63 (3), 565‚Äì597. online Weimar Germany's army had been limited to 100,000 men by the Treaty of Versailles, which also forbade the Germans to have aircraft, tanks, submarines, heavy artillery, poison gas, anti-tank weapons or many anti- aircraft guns. A team of inspectors from the League of Nations patrolled many German factories and workshops to ensure that these weapons were not being manufactured. =Treaty of Rapallo 1922 and secret military cooperation= The Treaty of Rapallo between Weimar Germany and the Soviet Union was signed by German Foreign Minister Walther Rathenau and his Soviet colleague Georgy Chicherin on April 16, 1922, during the Genoa Economic Conference, annulling all mutual claims, restoring full diplomatic relations, and establishing the beginnings of close trade relationships, which made Weimar Germany the main trading and diplomatic partner of the Soviet Union.Full text in English: German-Russian Agreement; April 16, 1922 (Treaty of Rapallo) . Rumors of a secret military supplement to the treaty soon spread. However, for a long time the consensus was that those rumors were wrong, and that Soviet-German military negotiations were independent of Rapallo and kept secret from the German Foreign Ministry for some time. This point of view was later challenged.Gordon H. Mueller, (\\"Rapallo Reexamined: A New Look at Germany's Secret Military Collaboration with Russia in 1922\\" Military Affairs (1976) 40#3, 109‚Äì117. excerptKretschmer, Ernst (1930).

The Review of Politics 2 (1), 34‚Äì62 On November 5, 1922, six other Soviet republics, which would soon become part of the Soviet Union, agreed to adhere to the Treaty of Rapallo as well.Full text in English: Supplementary Agreement to the German-Russian Agreement; November 5, 1922 The Soviets offered Weimar Germany facilities deep inside the USSR for building and testing arms and for military training, well away from Treaty inspectors' eyes. In return, the Soviets asked for access to German technical developments, and for assistance in creating a Red Army General Staff.Gatzke, Hans W. (1958). Russo-German Military Collaboration during the Weimar Republic. The American Historical Review 63 (3), 565‚Äì597. The first German officers went to the Soviet state for these purposes in March, 1922. One month later, Junkers began building aircraft at Fili, outside Moscow, in violation of Versailles. The great artillery manufacturer Krupp was soon active in the south of the USSR, near Rostov-on-Don. In 1925, a flying school was established near Lipetsk (Lipetsk fighter-pilot school) to train the first pilots for the future Luftwaffe. Since 1926, the Reichswehr had been able to use a tank school at Kazan (Kama tank school) and a chemical weapons facility in Saratov Oblast (Tomka gas test site). In turn, the Red Army gained access to these training facilities, as well as military technology and theory from Weimar Germany.Dyakov, Yu. L. & T. S. Bushueva. The Red Army and the Wehrmacht. How the Soviets Militarized Germany, 1922‚Äì1933, and Paved the Way for Fascism. New York: Prometheus Books, 1995. The Soviets offered submarine- building facilities at a port on the Black Sea, but this was not taken up. The Kriegsmarine did take up a later offer of a base near Murmansk, where German vessels could hide from the British. During the Cold War, this base at Polyarnyy (which had been built especially for the Germans) became the largest weapons store in the world. Documentation Most of the documents pertaining to secret German-Soviet military cooperation were systematically destroyed in Germany.Speidel, Helm (1953). Reichswehr und Rote Armee. Vierteljahrshefte f√ºr Zeitgeschichte I (Jan., 1953), 9‚Äì45 The Polish and French intelligence communities of the 1920s were remarkably well-informed regarding the cooperation. This did not, however, have any immediate effect upon German relations with other European powers. After World War II, the papers of General Hans von Seeckt and memoirs of other German officers became available, and after the dissolution of the Soviet Union, a handful of Soviet documents regarding this were published.Dyakov, Yu. L. & T. S.

Before World War I, Germany imported 1.5 billion German Reichsmarks of raw materials and other goods per year from Russia. This fell after World War I, but after trade agreements signed between the two countries in the mid-1920s, trade had increased to 433 million Reichsmarks per year by 1927. In the late 1920s, Germany helped Soviet industry begin to modernize, and to assist in the establishment of tank production facilities at the Leningrad Bolshevik Factory and the Kharkov Locomotive Factory. Germany's fear of international isolation due to a possible Soviet rapprochement with France, the main German adversary, was a key factor in the acceleration of economic negotiations. On October 12, 1925, a commercial agreement between the two nations was concluded.Morgan, R. P. (1963). The Political Significance of German-Soviet Trade Negotiations, 1922-5. The Historical Journal 6 (2), 253‚Äì271. =Plans for Poland= Alongside the Soviet Union's military and economic assistance, there was also political backing for Germany's aspirations. On July 19, 1920, Victor Kopp told the German Foreign Office that Soviet Russia wanted \\"a common frontier with Germany, south of Lithuania, approximately on a line with Bia≈Çystok\\".Richard K. Debo, Survival and Consolidation: The Foreign Policy of Soviet Russia, 1918‚Äì1921 (Montreal, Quebec & Kingston, Ontario: McGill-Queen's University Press, 1992), page 302. In other words, Poland was to be partitioned once again. These promptings were repeated over the years, with the Soviets always anxious to stress that ideological differences between the two governments were of no account; all that mattered was that the two countries were pursuing the same foreign policy objectives. On December 4, 1924, Victor Kopp, worried that the expected admission of Germany to the League of Nations (Germany was finally admitted to the League in 1926) was an anti-Soviet move, offered German Ambassador Ulrich Graf von Brockdorff-Rantzau to cooperate against the Second Polish Republic, and secret negotiations were sanctioned. However, the Weimar Republic rejected any venture into war. =Diplomatic relations= By 1919, both Germany and the Soviet Union were pariah nations in the eyes of Western leaders. Both were excluded from major conferences and were deeply distrusted. The effect was to bring Moscow and Berlin closer together, most notably at Rapallo. German diplomats worried at the revolutionary nature of the Soviet Union, but were reassured by Lenin's New Economic Policy that seem to restore a semblance of capitalism. Berlin officials concluded that their policy of engagement was a success. However, 1927 Berlin realized that the Comintern, and Stalin, did not reflect a retreat from revolutionary Marxist‚ÄìLeninism.J. David Cameron, \\"To Transform the Revolution into an Evolution: Underlying Assumptions of German Foreign Policy toward Soviet Russia, 1919-27.\\" Journal of Contemporary History 40.1 (2005): 7-24. In 1925, Germany broke its diplomatic isolation and took part in the Locarno Treaties with France and Belgium, undertaking not to attack them. The Soviet Union saw western d√©tente as potentially deepening its own political isolation in Europe, in particular by diminishing Soviet-German relationships. As Germany became less dependent on the Soviet Union, it became more unwilling to tolerate subversive Comintern interference: in 1925, several members of Rote Hilfe, a Communist Party organization, were tried for treason in Leipzig in what was known as the Cheka Trial. On April 24, 1926, Weimar Germany and the Soviet Union concluded another treaty (Treaty of Berlin (1926)), declaring the parties' adherence to the Treaty of Rapallo and neutrality for five years. The treaty was signed by German Foreign Minister Gustav Stresemann and Soviet ambassador Nikolay Krestinsky.Full text in English: Treaty of Berlin Between the Soviet Union and Germany; April 24, 1926 . The treaty was perceived as an imminent threat by Poland (which contributed to the success of the May Coup in Warsaw), and with caution by other European states regarding its possible effect upon Germany's obligations as a party to the Locarno Agreements. France also voiced concerns in this regard in the context of Germany's expected membership in the League of Nations.Garner, J. W. (1926). The Russo-German Treaty. The American Journal of International Law 20 (3), 530‚Äì533. = The \\"Third Period\\" = In 1928, the 9th Plenum of the Executive Committee of the Communist International and its 6th Congress in Moscow favored Stalin's program over the line pursued by Comintern Secretary General Nikolay Bukharin. Unlike Bukharin, Stalin believed that a deep crisis in western capitalism was imminent, and he denounced the cooperation of international communist parties with social democratic movements, labelling them as social fascists, and insisted on a far stricter subordination of international communist parties to the Comintern, that is, to Soviet leadership. This was known as the Third Period. The policy of the Communist Party of Germany (KPD) under Ernst Th√§lmann was altered accordingly. The relatively independent KPD of the early 1920s almost completely subordinated itself to the Soviet Union.Fischer, Ruth. Stalin and German Communism: a Study in the Origins of the State Party (1949).Kevin McDermott, and J. Agnew, The Comintern: a History of International Communism from Lenin to Stalin (1996). Stalin's order that the German Communist party must never again vote with the Social Democrats coincided with his agreement, in December 1928, with what was termed the 'Union of Industrialists'. Under this agreement the Union of Industrialists agreed to provide the Soviet Union with an up-to-date armaments industry and the industrial base to support it, on two conditions: Firstly, they required paying in hard currency, not in worthless Soviet rubles. Stalin desperately wanted their weapons, including anti-aircraft guns, howitzers, anti-tank guns, machine guns etc., but he was critically short of money. As Russia had been a major wheat exporter before the First World War, he decided to expel his recalcitrant kulak peasant farmers to the wastes of Siberia and create huge collective farms on their land like the 50,000 hectare farm that Krupp had created in the North Caucasus. Thus, in 1930 and 1931, a huge deluge of Soviet wheat at slave labour prices flooded unsuspecting world markets, where surpluses already prevailed, thereby causing poverty and distress to North American farmers. However, Stalin secured the precious foreign currency to pay for German armaments. Yet the Union of Industrialists were not only interested in cash for their weapons, they wanted a political concession. They feared the arrival of socialism in Germany and were irate at the KPD and Social Democrats objecting to providing funds for the development of new armored cruisers. Stalin would have had no compunction about ordering the German Communists to change sides if it suited his purpose. He had negotiated with the German armaments makers throughout the summer of 1928 and was determined to modernize his armed forces. From 1929 onwards, therefore, the Communists voted faithfully with the far right DNVP and Hitler's NSDAP in the Reichstag despite fighting them in the streets. Relying on the foreign affairs doctrine pursued by the Soviet leadership in the 1920s, in his report of the Central Committee to the Congress of the All-Union Communist Party (b) on June 27, 1930, Joseph Stalin welcomed the international destabilization and rise of political extremism among the capitalist powers.See Full text of the report in Russian =Early 1930s= The most intensive period of Soviet military collaboration with Weimar Germany was 1930‚Äì1932. On June 24, 1931, an extension of the 1926 Berlin Treaty was signed, though it was not until 1933 that it was ratified by the Reichstag due to internal political struggles. Some Soviet mistrust arose during the Lausanne Conference of 1932, when it was rumored that German Chancellor Franz von Papen had offered French Prime Minister √âdouard Herriot a military alliance. The Soviets were also quick to develop their own relations with France and its main ally, Poland. This culminated in the conclusion of the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact on July 25, 1932, and the Soviet-French non-aggression pact on November 29, 1932.Stein, George H. (1962) Russo-German Military Collaboration: The Last Phase, 1933. Political Science Quarterly 77 (1), 54‚Äì71. The conflict between the Communist Party of Germany and the Social Democratic Party of Germany fundamentally contributed to the demise of the Weimar Republic. It is, however, disputed whether Hitler's seizure of power came as a surprise to the USSR. Some authors claim that Stalin deliberately aided Hitler's rise by directing the policy of the Communist Party of Germany on a suicidal course in order to foster an inter-imperialist war,Tucker a theory dismissed by many others.Uldricks, Teddy J. (1977) Stalin and Nazi Germany. Slavic Review 36 (4), 599‚Äì603. During this period, trade between Germany and the Soviet Union declined as the more isolationist Stalinist regime asserted its power and as the abandonment of post-World War I military control decreased Germany's reliance on Soviet imports, such that Soviet imports fell to 223 million Reichsmarks by 1934. =Persecution of ethnic Germans in the USSR= The USSR had a large population of ethnic Germans, especially in the Volga German Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic, who were distrusted and persecuted by Stalin 1928 to 1948. They were relatively well- educated, and at first, class factors played a major role, giving way after 1933 to ethnic links to the dreaded Nazi German regime as the chief criterion. Very few the Germans involved supported Hitler, but no matter. the tax escalated after the German invasion of 1941. Some settlements were permanently banished to the east of the Urals.J. Otto Pohl, Eric J. Schmaltz, and Ronald J. Vossler. \\"'In our hearts we felt the sentence of death': ethnic German recollections of mass violence in the USSR, 1928‚Äì48.\\" Journal of Genocide Research 11.2-3 (2009): 323-354. online The Soviet Union and Nazi Germany before World War II Few questions concerning the origins of the Second World War are as controversial as the issue of pre-war Soviet policy toward Nazi Germany, especially due to the absence of a complete opening of the Politburo, Joseph Stalin's and Vyacheslav Molotov's papers on foreign affairs.Haslam, Jonathan (1997). Review: Soviet-German Relations and the Origins of the Second World War: The Jury Is Still Out. The Journal of Modern History 69.4, 785‚Äì797. German documents pertaining to their relations were captured by the American and British armies in 1945, and published by the U.S. Department of State shortly thereafter.Published as Documents on German Foreign Policy 1918‚Äì1945.

In the Soviet Union and Russia, including in official speeches and historiography, Nazi Germany has generally been referred to as Fascist Germany () from 1933 until today. =Initial relations after Hitler's election= Maxim Litvinov considered Nazi Germany to be the greatest threat to the Soviet Union. After Adolf Hitler came to power on January 30, 1933, he began the suppression of the Communist Party of Germany. The Nazis took police measures against Soviet trade missions, companies, press representatives, and individual citizens in Germany. They also launched an anti-Soviet propaganda campaign coupled with a lack of good will in diplomatic relations, although the German Foreign Ministry under Konstantin von Neurath (foreign minister from 1932‚Äì1938) was vigorously opposed to the impending breakup. The second volume of Hitler's programmatic Mein Kampf (which first appeared in 1926) called for Lebensraum (living space for the German nation) in the east (mentioning Russia specifically), and, in keeping with his world view, portrayed the Communists as Jews (see also Jewish Bolshevism) who were destroying a great nation.Bracher, Karl D., The German Dictatorship, Praeger, New York, 1976, p.425; Parrish, Thomas (ed.), The Simon and Schuster Encyclopedia of World War II, Simon and Schuster, New York, 1978, p. 398; Taylor, James, and Warren Shaw, The Third Reich Almanac, World Almanac, New York, 1987, p.212. See also John Toland's, Joachim Fest's, Alan Bullock's, or Robert Waite's biographies of Hitler for further insight. This ambition, if implemented, would be a clear danger to the security of the Soviet Union. Moscow's reaction to these steps of Berlin was initially restrained, with the exception of several tentative attacks on the new German government in the Soviet press. However, as the heavy-handed anti-Soviet actions of the German government continued unabated, the Soviets unleashed their own propaganda campaign against the Nazis, but by May the possibility of conflict appeared to have receded. The 1931 extension of the Berlin Treaty was ratified in Germany on May 5. In August 1933, Molotov assured German ambassador Herbert von Dirksen that Soviet-German relations would depend exclusively on the attitude of Germany towards the Soviet Union.Haslam, The Soviet Union and the Struggle, p. 22. However, Reichswehr access to the three military training and testing sites (Lipetsk, Kama, and Tomka) was abruptly terminated by the Soviet Union in August‚ÄìSeptember 1933. Political understanding between the Soviet Union and Nazi Germany was finally broken by the German-Polish Non-Aggression Pact of January 26, 1934 between Nazi Germany and the Second Polish Republic.Carr, E. H. (1949) From Munich to Moscow. I. Soviet Studies 1 (1), 3‚Äì17. Maxim Litvinov, who had been People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs (Foreign Minister of the USSR) since 1930, considered Nazi Germany to be the greatest threat to the Soviet Union. However, as the Red Army was perceived as not strong enough, and the USSR sought to avoid becoming embroiled in a general European war, he began pursuing a policy of collective security, trying to contain Nazi Germany via cooperation with the League of Nations and the Western Powers. The Soviet attitude towards the League of Nations and international peace had changed. In 1933‚Äì34 the Soviet Union was diplomatically recognized for the first time by Spain, the United States, Hungary, Czechoslovakia, Romania, and Bulgaria, and ultimately joined the League of Nations in September 1934. It is often argued that the change in Soviet foreign policy happened around 1933‚Äì34, and that it was triggered by Hitler's assumption of power.A. B. Ulam, Expansion and Co-existence (New York, 1968), p. 195M. Beloff, The Foreign Policy of Soviet Russia, 1929‚Äì1941, vol. I (London, 1947). p. 89. However, the Soviet turn towards the French Third Republic in 1932, discussed above, could also have been a part of the policy change. Hermann Rauschning in his 1940 book Hitler Speaks: A Series of Political Conversations With Adolf Hitler on His Real Aims 1934 records Adolf Hitler as speaking of an inescapable battle against both Pan-Slavism and Neo- Slavism. The authenticity of the book is controversial: some historians, such as Wolfgang H√§nel, claim that the book is a fabrication, whereas others, such as Richard Steigmann-Gall, Ian Kershaw and Hugh Trevor-Roper, have avoided using it as a reference due to its questionable authenticity. Rauschning records Hitler as saying of the Slavs:Rauschning, Hermann, Hitler Speaks: A Series of Political Conversations With Adolf Hitler on His Real Aims, Kessinger Publishing, 2006, , pages 136‚Äì7 =Relations in the mid-1930s= On May 2, 1935 France and the USSR signed a five-year Franco-Soviet Treaty of Mutual Assistance.France-U.S.S.R.: Treaty of Mutual Assistance. The American Journal of International Law 30 (4), Supplement: Official Documents. (Oct. 1936), pp. 177‚Äì180. France's ratification of the treaty provided one of the reasons why Hitler remilitarized the Rhineland on March 7, 1936. The 7th World Congress of the Comintern in 1935 officially endorsed the Popular Front strategy of forming broad alliances with parties willing to oppose fascism ‚Äì Communist parties had started pursuing this policy from 1934. Also in 1935, at the 7th Congress of Soviets (in a study in contradiction), Molotov stressed the need for good relations with Berlin.Haslam, The Soviet Union and the Struggle, p. 46. Anti-Soviet propaganda poster in Nazi Germany, 1939 On November 25, 1936, Nazi Germany and Imperial Japan concluded the Anti- Comintern Pact, which Fascist Italy joined in 1937. Economically, the Soviet Union made repeated efforts to reestablish closer contacts with Germany in the mid-1930s. The Soviet Union chiefly sought to repay debts from earlier trade with raw materials, while Germany sought to rearm. The two countries signed a credit agreement in 1935. By 1936, crises in the supply of raw materials and foodstuffs forced Hitler to decree a Four Year Plan for rearmament \\"without regard to costs\\".: \\"By 1936 raw material and foodstuff shortages reached the crisis stage forcing Hitler to decree a Four Year Plan for rearmament 'without regard to costs.'\\" However, despite those issues, Hitler rebuffed the Soviet Union's attempts to seek closer political ties to Germany along with an additional credit agreement. Litvinov's strategy faced ideological and political obstacles. The ruling Conservatives in Britain, who dominated the House of Commons from 1931 onwards, continued to regard the Soviet Union as no less of a threat than Nazi Germany (some saw the USSR as the greater threat). At the same time, as the Soviet Union underwent upheavals in the midst of the Great Purge of 1934‚Äì1940, the West did not perceive it as a potentially valuable ally. Further complicating matters, the purge of the People's Commissariat for Foreign Affairs forced the Soviet Union to close down quite a number of embassies abroad.Uldricks, Teddy J. (1977) The Impact of the Great Purges on the People's Commissariat of Foreign Affairs. Slavic Review 36 (2), 187‚Äì204.See The German Ambassador in the Soviet Union (Schulenburg) to the German Foreign Ministry of January 13, 1938 and The German Ambassador in the Soviet Union (Schulenburg) to the German Foreign Ministry of January 17, 1938 @ Avalon Project At the same time, the purges made the signing of an economic deal with Germany less likely: they disrupted the already confused Soviet administrative structure necessary for negotiations and thus prompted Hitler to regard the Soviets as militarily weak. =Spanish Civil War= The Spanish Civil War (1936‚Äì1939) was in part a proxy war. The Nationalists led by General Francisco Franco and the Republican government fought for control of the country. Militarily, the Nationalists usually had the upper hand and they won in the end. Germany sent in elite air and tank units to the Nationalist forces; and Italy sent in several combat divisions. The Soviet Union sent military and political advisors, and sold munitions in support of the \\"Loyalist,\\" or Republican, side. The Comintern helped Communist parties around the world send in volunteers to the International Brigades that fought for the Loyalists.Michael Alpert, A New International History of the Spanish Civil War (2nd ed. 2004) excerpt and text search =Collective security failures= Litvinov's policy of containing Germany via collective security failed utterly with the conclusion of the Munich Agreement on September 29, 1938, when Britain and France favored self-determination of the Sudetenland Germans over Czechoslovakia's territorial integrity, disregarding the Soviet position.Haslam, The Soviet Union and the Struggle, chap. 10. However, it is still disputed whether, even before Munich, the Soviet Union would actually have fulfilled its guarantees to Czechoslovakia, in the case of an actual German invasion resisted by France.Jonathan Haslam (1979). The Soviet Union and the Czechoslovakian Crisis of 1938. Journal of Contemporary History 14 (3), 441‚Äì461.Hochman, Jiri. The Soviet Union and the Failure of Collective Security, 1934‚Äì1938. London ‚Äì Ithaca, New York: Cornell University Press, 1984. In April 1939, Litvinov launched the tripartite alliance negotiations with the new British and French ambassadors, (William Seeds, assisted by William Strang, and Paul-Emile Naggiar), in an attempt to contain Germany. However, for one reason or another, they were constantly dragged out and proceeded with major delays.Michael Jabara Carley (1993). End of the 'Low, Dishonest Decade': Failure of the Anglo-Franco-Soviet Alliance in 1939. Europe-Asia Studies 45 (2), 303‚Äì341. The Western powers believed that war could still be avoided and the USSR, much weakened by the purges, could not act as a main military participant. The USSR more or less disagreed with them on both issues, approaching the negotiations with caution because of the traditional hostility of the capitalist powers.Watson, Derek (2000).

Germany lacked oil, and could only supply 25 percent of its own needs, leaving Germany 2 million tons short a year and a staggering 10 million tons below planned mobilization totals, while the Soviet Union was required for numerous key other raw materials, such as ores (including iron and manganese), rubber and food fat and oils. While Soviet imports into Germany had fallen to 52.8 million Reichsmarks in 1937, massive armament production increases and critical raw material shortages caused Germany to turn to reverse their prior attitude, pushing forward economic talks in early 1939. On May 3, 1939, Litvinov was dismissed and Vyacheslav Molotov, who had strained relations with Litvinov, was not of Jewish origin (unlike Litvinov), and had always been in favour of neutrality towards Germany, was put in charge of foreign affairs. The Foreign Affairs Commissariat was purged of Litvinov's supporters and Jews. All this could well have purely internal reasons, but it could also be a signal to Germany that the era of anti-German collective security was past,Richard Overy and Andrew Wheatcroft, The Road to War or a signal to the British and French that Moscow should be taken more seriously in the tripartite alliance negotiationsRoberts, Geoffrey (1992). \\"The Soviet Decision for a Pact with Nazi Germany\\".

Another point of view is that the Soviet's pursuit of a triple alliance was sincere and that the Soviet government turned to Germany only when an alliance with the Western powers proved impossible.Taylor (1962), The Origins of the Second World War, pp. 229, 232, 240‚Äì241.Roberts, Geoffrey.

Molotov suggested that the Japanese attack might have been inspired by Germany in order to hinder the conclusion of the tripartite alliance.Watson, Derek (2000). Molotov's Apprenticeship in Foreign Policy: The Triple Alliance Negotiations in 1939. Europe-Asia Studies 52 (4), 695‚Äì722. In July, open Soviet‚ÄìGerman trade negotiations were under way. In late July and early August, talks between the parties turned to a potential deal, but Soviet negotiators made clear that an economic deal must first be worked out. After Germany had scheduled its invasion of Poland on August 25, and prepared for the resulting war with France, German war planners estimated that a British naval blockade would further exacerbate critical German raw material shortages for which the Soviet Union was the only potential supplier. Then, on August 3, German Foreign Minister Joachim Ribbentrop outlined a plan in which Germany and the Soviet Union would agree to nonintervention in each other's affairs and would renounce measures aimed at the other's vital interests and that \\"there was no problem between the Baltic and the Black Sea that could not be solved between the two of us.\\"Fest, Joachim C., Hitler, Harcourt Brace Publishing, 2002 , pp. 589‚Äì90Vehvil√§inen, Olli, Finland in the Second World War: Between Germany and Russia, Macmillan, 2002, , page 30 The Germans stated that \\"there is one common element in the ideology of Germany, Italy and the Soviet Union: opposition to the capitalist democracies of the West\\",Bertriko, Jean-Jacques Subrenat, A. and David Cousins, Estonia: Identity and Independence, Rodopi, 2004, page 131 and explained that their prior hostility toward Soviet Bolshevism had subsided with the changes in the Comintern and with the Soviet renunciation of a world revolution. =Pact and commercial deal signings= Stalin welcoming Ribbentrop in the Kremlin, August 23, 1939 Signing of the Molotov‚ÄìRibbentrop Pact. Joseph Stalin is the second from the right, smiling Signatures on the secret protocol Planned and actual divisions of Europe, according to the Molotov‚ÄìRibbentrop Pact, with later adjustments. By August 10, the countries had worked out the last minor technical details to make all but final their economic arrangement, but the Soviets delayed signing that agreement for almost ten days until they were sure that they had reached a political agreement with Germany. The Soviet ambassador explained to German officials that the Soviets had begun their British negotiations \\"without much enthusiasm\\" at a time when they felt Germany would not \\"come to an understanding\\", and the parallel talks with the British could not be simply broken off when they had been initiated after 'mature consideration.' Meanwhile, every internal German military and economic study had argued that Germany was doomed to defeat without at least Soviet neutrality. On August 19, the German‚ÄìSoviet Commercial Agreement (1939) was reached. The agreement covered \\"current\\" business, which entailed a Soviet obligation to deliver 180 million Reichsmarks in raw materials in response to German orders, while Germany would allow the Soviets to order 120 million Reichsmarks for German industrial goods. Under the agreement, Germany also granted the Soviet Union a merchandise credit of 200 million Reichsmarks over 7 years to buy German manufactured goods at an extremely favorable interest rate. On August 22 the secret political negotiationsSee also the German diplomatic documents, Agreement Achieved, August 14 ‚Äì August 23, 1939 @ Avalon Project were revealed when German newspapers announced that the Soviet Union and Nazi Germany were about to conclude a non-aggression pact, and that the Soviet Union's prolonged negotiations regarding a Triple Alliance with France and Britain had been suspended. The Soviets blamed on the Western powers their reluctance to take the Soviet Union's military assistance seriously and to acknowledge the Soviet right to cross Poland and Romania, if necessary against their will,Poland declined to accept any help from the Soviet Union. The Soviets did not try to approach Poland and Romania directly and entirely relied on the British and French mediation. and furthermore their failure to send representatives with more importance and clearly defined powers and to resolve the disagreement over the notion of indirect aggression. On August 23, 1939, a German delegation headed by Foreign Minister Joachim von Ribbentrop arrived to Moscow, and in the following night the Molotov‚ÄìRibbentrop Pact was signed by him and his Soviet colleague Vyacheslav Molotov, in the presence of Soviet leader Joseph Stalin.Treaty of Nonaggression Between Germany and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics @ Avalon Project The ten-year pact of non- aggression declared both parties' continued adherence to the Treaty of Berlin (1926), but the pact was also supplemented by a secret additional protocol, which divided Eastern Europe into German and Soviet zones of influence:Secret Additional Protocol @ Avalon Project > 1\\\\.

Nazi-Soviet Relations 1939‚Äì1941: Documents from the Archives of The German Foreign Office. Washington, D.C.: Department of State, 1948. P. 78. The news of the Pact, which was announced by Pravda and Izvestia on August 24, was met with utter shock and surprise by government leaders and media worldwide, most of whom were aware of only the British-French-Soviet negotiations, which had taken place for months. British and French negotiators, who were in Moscow negotiating what they thought would be the military part of an alliance with the Soviet Union, were told \\"no useful purpose can be served in continuing the conversation.\\" On August 25, Hitler told the British ambassador to Berlin that the pact with the Soviets freed Germany from the prospect of a two front war, thereby changing the strategic situation from that which had prevailed in World War I, and that therefore Britain should accept his demands regarding Poland. However, Hitler was surprised when Britain signed a mutual-assistance treaty with Poland that day, causing Hitler to delay the planned August 26 invasion of western Poland. The pact was ratified by the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union on August 31, 1939. World War II =German invasion of western Poland= Invasion of Poland: Germany (grey), the Soviet Union (red) and the European allies of Poland (green) German General Heinz Guderian and Soviet Combrig Semyon Krivoshein holding a joint victory parade in Brest, September 23, 1939 Molotov, Stalin and Ribbentrop signing the German‚ÄìSoviet Boundary and Friendship Treaty, Moscow, September 1939 A week after having signed the Molotov‚ÄìRibbentrop pact, on September 1, 1939, Nazi Germany invaded its zone of influence in Poland. On September 3, the United Kingdom, Australia, New Zealand and France, fulfilling their obligations to the Second Polish Republic, declared war on Germany. The Second World War broke out in Europe. On September 4, as Britain blockaded Germany at sea, German cargo ships heading towards German ports were diverted to the Soviet Arctic port of Murmansk. On September 8 the Soviet side agreed to pass it by railway to the Soviet Baltic port of Leningrad. At the same time the Soviet Union refused to allow a Polish transit through its territory citing the threat of being drawn into war on September 5. Von der Schulenburg reported to Berlin that attacks on the conduct of Germany in the Soviet press had ceased completely and the portrayal of events in the field of foreign politics largely coincided with the German point of view, while anti-German literature had been removed from the trade.The German Ambassador in the Soviet Union (Schulenburg) to the German Foreign Office @ Avalon Project On September 7 Stalin once again outlined a new line for the Comintern that was now based on the idea that the war was an inter-imperialist conflict and hence there was no reason for the working class to side with Britain, France, or Poland against Germany, thus departing from the Comintern's anti-fascist popular front policy of 1934‚Äì1939.Roberts, Geoffrey (1992). The Soviet Decision for a Pact with Nazi Germany. Soviet Studies 44 (1), 57‚Äì78. He labeled Poland as a fascist state oppressing Belarusians and Ukrainians. German diplomats had urged the Soviet Union to intervene against Poland from the east since the beginning of the war,The Reich Foreign Minister to the German Ambassador in the Soviet Union (Schulenburg) @ Avalon Project and some following documents but the Soviet Union was reluctant to intervene as Warsaw had not yet fallen. The Soviet decision to invade that part of eastern of Poland which had earlier been agreed as the Soviet zone of influence was communicated to the German ambassador Friedrich Werner von der Schulenburg on September 9, but the actual invasion was delayed for more than a week.The German Ambassador in the Soviet Union (Schulenburg) to the German Foreign Office @ Avalon Project The Polish intelligence became aware of the Soviet plans around September 12. =Soviet invasion of eastern Poland= On September 17 the Soviet Union finally entered the Polish territories that had been granted to it by the secret protocol of non-aggression pact from the east. As the pretexts to justify their actions, the Soviets cited the collapse of the Second Polish Republic and they claimed that they were trying to help the Belorussian and Ukrainian people. The Soviet invasion is usually considered direct result of the pact, although the revisionist school contends that this was not the case and that the Soviet decision was taken a few weeks later. The Soviet move was denounced by Britain and France, but they did not intervene. In an exchange of captured Polish territories in compliance with the terms of the protocol, already on September 17 the Red Army and Wehrmacht held a joint military parade in Brest; occupation of the city was then transferred by Germany to the Soviet troops. In the following battles with the rest of the Second Polish Republic's army, the Soviet Union occupied the territories roughly corresponding to its sphere of interests, as defined in the secret additional protocol to the Molotov‚ÄìRibbentrop Pact. The territory of Poland had been completely occupied by the two powers by October 6, and the Polish state was liquidated. In early November the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union annexed the occupied territories and the Soviet Union shared a common border with Nazi Germany, the Nazi-occupied Polish territories and Lithuania for the first time. After the invasion, cooperation between Germany and the Soviet Union was visible, for example, in the four Gestapo-NKVD Conferences, where the occupying powers discussed plans for dealing with the Polish resistance movement, for the further destruction of Poland, and which enabled both parties to exchange Polish prisoners of interest prior to the signing of German‚ÄìSoviet Frontier Treaty in Moscow in the presence of Joseph Stalin.\\"Terminal horror suffered by so many millions of innocent Jewish, Slavic, and other European peoples as a result of this meeting of evil minds is an indelible stain on the history and integrity of Western civilization, with all of its humanitarian pretensions\\" (Note: \\"this meeting\\" refers to the most famous third (Zakopane) conference). Conquest, Robert (1991). Stalin: Breaker of Nations. New York, N.Y.: Viking. The cooperation between Gestapo and NKVD continued, resulting in further exchanges of prisoners, among them Margarete Buber-Neumann, Alexander Weissberg-Cybulski, Betty Olberg and Max Zucker. =Amendment of the Secret Protocols= On September 25, when Hitler was still going to proceed to Lithuania, the Soviet Union proposed to renegotiate the spheres of interest. On September 28, 1939 in Moscow Molotov and Ribbentrop signed the German- Soviet Boundary and Friendship Treaty, determining the boundary of their respective national interests in the territory of the former Polish state.German-Soviet Boundary and Friendship Treaty @ Avalon Project In a secret supplementary protocol to the treaty the spheres of interest outside Poland were renegotiated, and in exchange for some already captured portions of the Polish territory Germany acknowledged still independent Lithuania part of the Soviet zone.Secret Supplementary Protocol @ Avalon Project =Expanded commercial pact= Germany and the Soviet Union entered an intricate trade pact on February 11, 1940 that was over four times larger than the one the two countries had signed in August 1939. The trade pact helped Germany to surmount a British blockade of Germany. In the first year, Germany received one million tons of cereals, half a million tons of wheat, 900,000 tons of oil, 100,000 tons of cotton, 500,000 tons of phosphates and considerable amounts of other vital raw materials, along with the transit of one million tons of soybeans from Manchuria. These and other supplies were being transported through Soviet and occupied Polish territories, and this allowed Nazi Germany to circumvent the British naval blockade. The Soviets were to receive a naval cruiser, the plans to the battleship Bismarck, heavy naval guns, other naval gear and thirty of Germany's latest warplanes, including the Bf 109 fighter, Bf 110 fighter and Ju 88 bomber. The Soviets would also receive oil and electric equipment, locomotives, turbines, generators, diesel engines, ships, machine tools and samples of Germany artillery, tanks, explosives, chemical-warfare equipment and other items. The Soviets also helped Germany to avoid British naval blockades by providing a submarine base, Basis Nord, in the northern Soviet Union near Murmansk.Cohen, Yohanon, Small Nations in Times of Crisis and Confrontation, SUNY Press, 1989, , page 110 This also provided a refueling and maintenance location, and a takeoff point for raids and attacks on shipping. =Soviet war with Finland= The last negotiations with Finland had been initiated by the Soviet side as part of its collective security policy in April 1938, and aimed to reach an understanding and to secure a favorable Finnish position in case of a German attack on the Soviet Union through Finnish territory, but this had proven futile due to the Finnish reluctance to break its neutrality, and negotiations ended in April 1939, shortly before Litvinov's dismissal. On October 13, 1939 new negotiations started in Moscow, and the Soviet Union (represented by Stalin, Molotov, and Vladimir Potyomkin) presented Finland with proposals including a mutual assistance pact, the lease of the military base of Hanko, and the cession of a 70 km-deep area on the Karelian Isthmus located immediately to the north of the city of Leningrad to the Soviet Union, in exchange for border lands further to the north. Finland, however, refused to accept the offer, withdrew from negotiations on November 7, 1939, and continued preparations for a possible Soviet invasion. On November 26, the Soviet Union staged the shelling of Mainila near the border, accused Finnish troops of the provocation and requesting their withdrawal. In turn, on November 27 Finland requested a withdrawal of troops of both nations from the border area. On November 28, the Soviet Union denounced the 1932 Soviet-Finnish Non-Aggression Pact, and on November 29 broke off diplomatic relations with Finland. On November 30, 1939, forces of the USSR under the command of Kliment Voroshilov attacked Finland in what became known as the Winter War, starting with the invasion of Finnish Karelia and bombing civilian boroughs of Helsinki. On December 1, 1939, the puppet socialist government of the Finnish Democratic Republic was established under the auspices of the Soviet Union in the border town of Terijoki. On December 14 the Soviet Union was expelled from the League of Nations for waging a war of aggression. After presiding over the disastrous start of the campaign, and a disproportionally heavy death toll of Red Army soldiers, Voroshilov was replaced by Semyon Timoshenko as the commander of the front on January 7, 1940 (and four months later as People's Commissar for Defense). In mid-February, 1940, Soviet troops finally managed to break through the Mannerheim Line, and Finland sought an armistice.Vehvil√§inen, Olli. Finland in the Second World War: Between Germany and Russia. New York: Palgrave, 2002. .Van Dyke, Carl. The Soviet Invasion of Finland 1939‚Äì1940. London: Frank Cass, 1997. . The Moscow Peace Treaty was signed on March 12, 1940, and at noon the following day the fighting ended. Finland ceded the Karelian Isthmus and Ladoga Karelia, part of Salla and Kalastajasaarento, and leased the Hanko naval base to the USSR, but remained a neutral state, albeit increasingly leaning toward Germany (see Interim Peace). The consequences of the conflict were multiple: Although the Soviet Union gained new territories, the war pushed neutral Finland towards an accommodation with Nazi Germany. Furthermore, the invasion had revealed the striking military weaknesses of the Red Army. This prompted the Soviet Union to reorganize its military forces, but it also dealt yet another blow to the international prestige of the USSR. As a result of having suffered disproportionately high losses compared to the Finnish troops ‚Äî despite a fourfold Soviet superiority in troops and nearly absolute superiority in heavy weapons and aircraft ‚Äî the Red Army appeared to be an easy target, which contributed to Hitler's decision to plan an attack against the Soviet Union. Soviet official casualty counts in the war exceeded 200,000, while Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev later claimed the casualties may have been one million.Mosier, John, The Blitzkrieg Myth: How Hitler and the Allies Misread the Strategic Realities of World War II, HarperCollins, 2004, , page 88 =Soviets take the Baltics= From the beginning, there was tension over the Soviets' moves in Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, which were in the Soviet sphere of influence. All three were given no choice but to sign a so-called Pact of defence and mutual assistance which permitted the Soviet Union to station troops in them.Wettig, Gerhard, Stalin and the Cold War in Europe, Rowman & Littlefield, Landham, Md, 2008, , page 20-21 Nazi Germany advised them to accept the conditions. The Baltic states acceded to the Soviet demands and signed mutual assistance treaties on September 28, October 5, and October 10, 1939, respectively (for ten years for Estonia and Latvia and fifteen years for Lithuania). The tension included the internment of a submarine crew in the Orze≈Ç incident. On October 18, October 29, and November 3, 1939, the first Soviet troops entered Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania under the Pact.Moscow's Week at Time magazine on Monday, October 9, 1939The Baltic States: Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania by David J. Smith, Page 24, Tannberg. Tarvel. Documents on the Soviet Military Occupation of Estonia, Trames, 2006. The Soviet Union had been discontented with the Baltic states leaning toward Britain and France, the so-called Baltic Entente dating back to 1934, which could potentially be reoriented toward Germany, and considered it a violation of the mutual-assistance treaties of the autumn of 1939. On May 25, 1940, after several Soviet soldiers had disappeared from Soviet garrisons in Lithuania, Molotov accused the city of Kaunas of provocations. On June 14, People's Commissar of Defence Timoshenko ordered a complete blockade of Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania. The Soviet air force shot down a Finnish passenger plane Kaleva heading from Tallinn towards Helsinki. Shortly before midnight, Molotov presented Lithuania with a ten-hour ultimatum, demanding the replacement of the Lithuanian government with a pro-Soviet one and free access for additional Soviet troops, threatening the country with immediate occupation otherwise. Lithuanian President Antanas Smetona insisted on armed resistance, but was not supported by the military leadership, so Lithuania acceded to the ultimatum. The government was reshuffled and additional Soviet troops entered Lithuania. Vladimir Dekanozov was sent to Kaunas as the Soviet special envoy. The following night, Smetona fled to Germany (and later to Switzerland, and then to the United States). On June 16, Molotov presented similar ultimatums to Latvia and Estonia, citing Soviet concerns over the Baltic Entente, and they acceded as well. At the same time, the Wehrmacht started concentrating along the Lithuanian border. In mid-June 1940, when international attention was focused on the German invasion of France, Soviet NKVD troops raided border posts in Lithuania, Estonia and Latvia.Senn, Alfred Erich, Lithuania 1940 : revolution from above, Amsterdam, New York, Rodopi, 2007 State administrations were liquidated and replaced by Soviet cadres; as a result, 34,250 Latvians, 75,000 Lithuanians and almost 60,000 Estonians were deported or killed. Elections were held with single pro-Soviet candidates listed for many positions, with resulting peoples assemblies immediately requested admission into the USSR, which was granted by the Soviet Union. With France no longer in a position to be the guarantor of the status quo in Eastern Europe, and the Third Reich pushing Romania to make concessions to the Soviet Union, the Romanian government gave in, following Italy's counsel and Vichy France's recent example. =August tensions= The Finnish and Baltic invasions caused a deterioration of relations between Germany and the Soviet Union.Kennan, George. Russian and the West, under Lenin and Stalin, New York Mentor Books, 1961 pp 318,319 Because of tensions caused by these invasions, Germany's falling behind in deliveries of goods, and Stalin's worries that Hitler's war with the West might end quickly after France signed an armistice, in August 1940, the Soviet Union briefly suspended its deliveries under the German-Soviet Commercial Agreement. The suspension created significant resource problems for Germany. By the end of August, relations improved again. =Soviet negotiations regarding joining the Axis= Joachim von Ribbentrop welcoming Vyacheslav Molotov in Berlin, November 1940 After Germany entered a Tripartite Pact with Japan and Italy, in October 1940, Ribbentrop wrote to Stalin about \\"the historical mission of the Four Powers ‚Äì the Soviet Union, Italy, Japan and Germany ‚Äì to adopt a long range-policy and to direct the future development of their peoples into the right channels by delimitation of their interests in a worldwide scale.\\" Stalin replied, referencing entering an agreement regarding a \\"permanent basis\\" for their \\"mutual interests.\\" Stalin sent Molotov to Berlin to negotiate the terms for the Soviet Union to join the Axis and potentially enjoy the spoils of the pact.Brackman, Roman, The Secret File of Joseph Stalin: A Hidden Life, London and Portland, Frank Cass Publishers, 2001, , page 341 Ribbentrop asked Molotov to sign another secret protocol with the statement: \\"The focal point of the territorial aspirations of the Soviet Union would presumably be centered south of the territory of the Soviet Union in the direction of the Indian Ocean.\\"Brackman, Roman, The Secret File of Joseph Stalin: A Hidden Life, London and Portland, Frank Cass Publishers, 2001, , page 343 Molotov took the position that he could not take a \\"definite stand\\" on this without Stalin's agreement. In response to a written German draft four powers agreement, Stalin presented a written counterproposal, including the Soviets joining the four power Axis if Germany foreclosed acting in the Soviet's sphere of influence. Germany never responded the counterproposal.Donaldson, Robert H. and Joseph L. Nogee, The Foreign Policy of Russia: Changing Systems, Enduring Interests, M.E. Sharpe, 2005, , pages 65‚Äì66Churchill, Winston, The Second World War, Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, 1953, , pages 520‚Äì21 =January 1941 Border and Commercial Agreement= On January 10, 1941, Germany and the Soviet Union signed an agreement that settled several ongoing issues. The agreement formally set the border between Germany and the Soviet Union between the Igorka river and the Baltic Sea,Johari, J.C., Soviet Diplomacy 1925‚Äì41: 1925‚Äì27, Anmol Publications PVT. LTD., 2000, pages 134‚Äì137 It extended trade regulation of the 1940 German-Soviet Commercial Agreement until August 1, 1942, increased deliveries above the levels of year one of that agreement, settled trading rights in the Baltics and Bessarabia, calculated the compensation for German property interests in the Baltic States now occupied by the Soviets and other issues. It also covered the migration to Germany within two and a half months of ethnic Germans and German citizens in Soviet-held Baltic territories, and the migration to the Soviet Union of Baltic and \\"White Russian\\" \\"nationals\\" in German-held territories. Secret protocols in the new agreement stated that Germany would renounce its claims to one piece of Lithuanian territory in the \\"Secret Additional Protocols\\" of the German‚ÄìSoviet Boundary and Friendship Treaty and would be paid 7.5 million dollars (31.5 million Reichsmark). The agreements provided the USSR with new weapons, while in return it provided Germany with a million tons of feed grains, nine hundred thousand tons of oil, half a million tons of phosphate, half a million tons of iron ore, plus chromium and other raw materials. =Mid-1941 relations= In an effort to demonstrate peaceful intentions toward Germany, on April 13, 1941, the Soviets signed a neutrality pact with Axis power Japan. While Stalin had little faith in Japan's commitment to neutrality, he felt that the pact was important for its political symbolism, to reinforce a public affection for Germany. Stalin felt that there was a growing split in German circles about whether Germany should initiate a war with the Soviet Union. Stalin did not know that Hitler had been secretly discussing an invasion of the Soviet Union since the summer of 1940, and that Hitler had ordered his military in late 1940 to prepare for war in the east regardless of the parties' talks of a potential Soviet entry as a fourth Axis Power.Weeks, Albert L., Stalin's Other War: Soviet Grand Strategy, 1939‚Äì1941, Rowman & Littlefield, 2003, , page 74-5 =Further development= 1940 Soviet map of the western portions of the Ukrainian SSR captured from Poland in 1939. The adjacent parts of Poland occupied by Nazi Germany are labeled area of state interests of Germany During 1940, Nazi Germany pursued its conquest of western Europe: On April 9, 1940, Germany invaded Denmark and Norway. On May 15, the Netherlands capitulated. By June 2, Germany had occupied Belgium. On June 14, Wehrmacht entered Paris. On June 22, France surrendered. The British historians Alan S. Milward and W. Medicott show that Nazi Germany ‚Äî unlike Imperial Germany ‚Äî was prepared only for a short war (Blitzkrieg).Milward, German Economy at War. London 1965, pp. 2‚Äì18; Medicott, The Economic Blockade. Vol I, London 1952, pp. 47‚Äì48. According to Andreas Hillgruber,Hillgruber, Germany at two World Wars. Harvard University Press, 1981, p. 75 without the necessary supplies from the USSR and strategic security in the East, Germany could not have succeeded in the West. Had the Soviet Union joined the Anglo-French blockade, the German war economy would have soon collapsed. If Germany had been forced to rely on its own raw materials as of September 1939, those resources would have lasted a mere 9 to 12 months.Hillgruber, Hitlers Strategie. Politik und Kriegsf√ºhrung 1940‚Äì1941. Frankfurt am Main, 1965. S.667‚Äì671 According to Mr. Rapoport, \\"one of Stalin's first gifts to the Nazis was to turn over some 600 German Communists, most of them Jews, to the Gestapo at Brest-Litovsk in German-occupied Poland.\\"Anatomies of a Murderer by DAVID K.

Molotov's report on March 29, 1940 http://www.histdoc.net/history/molotov.html By invading Poland and annexing the Baltic States, Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union eliminated the buffer states between them and magnified the threat of war.Aleksandr M. Nekrich, Pariahs, Partners, Predators: German-Soviet Relations, 1922‚Äì1941. New York: Columbia University Press, 1997. p. 144 Volksdeutsche in the Soviet Union Pokrovsk, the capital of the Volga German ASSR, 1928 Volga German ASSR (orange) in 1940 Ethnic Germans in Soviet Russia of the 1920s enjoyed a certain degree of cultural autonomy, there were 8 national districts in the Ukraine as well as a number in Russia and one each in Georgia and Azerbizan and Volga German Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic (Volga German ASSR), schools and newspapers, in compliance with the policy of national delimitation in the Soviet Union. In September 1929, discontented with the reintroduction of coercive grain requisitions and collectivization of agriculture, several thousand Soviet peasants of German descent (mostly Mennonites) convened in Moscow, demanding exit visas to emigrate to Canada, provoking a significant political scandal in Germany, which soured Soviet-German relations. The charity \\"Brothers in Need\\" was established in Germany to raise money for the Soviet Germans, President Paul von Hindenburg himself donated 200 thousand Reichsmarks of his own money for that purpose. The Soviet government first permitted 5,461 Germans to emigrate, but then deported the remaining 9,730 back to their original places of residence.Dyck, Harvey.

However, throughout 1930, efforts were still being made by the Soviet government to increase the number and quality of German national institutions in the Soviet Union. The first mass arrests and show trials specifically targeting Soviet Germans (those who were considered counter- revolutionaries) occurred in the Soviet Union during the 1933 Ukrainian terror. However, with the Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party (b)'s decree of November 5, 1934, the domestic anti-German campaign assumed all-union dimensions. In 1933‚Äì1934, a campaign was launched in Germany to help Soviet Volksdeutsche during the famine by sending food packets and money.Buchsweiler, Meir. Volksdeutsche in der Ukraine am Vorabend und Beginn des Zweiten Weltkriegs ‚Äì ein Fall doppelter Loyalit√§t? (Gerlingen, 1984), pp. 64‚Äì71. Deeply concerned over cross-border ethnic ties of national minorities (such as Germans, Poles, Finns), in 1934 the Soviet Union decided to create a new border security zone along its western border, and in 1935‚Äì1937 potentially disloyal nationalities (including German) were mostly (albeit not completely) deported from this strip of land to the inner parts of the Soviet Union by NKVD. German national institutions were gradually abolished.Martin, An Affirmative Action Empire, pp. 757‚Äì759. In 1937‚Äì1938 NKVD conducted mass operations \\"for the destruction of espionage and sabotage contingents\\" (known as National operations of NKVD) among diaspora nationalities against both Soviet and foreign citizens (resulting in arrest and usually execution), including an NKVD campaign against Germans, in fact indiscriminately targeting national minorities during the Great Terror. Concurrently all German and other diaspora national districts and schools in the Soviet Union except the Volga German ASSR and German schools within that republic were abolished.See also The German Ambassador in the Soviet Union (Schulenburg) to the German Foreign Ministry (February 7, 1938) @ Avalon Project The Soviet government had made a prior decision to evacuate the entire population of German origin in case of German invasion, which was immediately implemented after the actual invasion by forcibly transferring 1.2 million citizens of German origin from European Russia to Siberia and Soviet Central Asia.–ë—É–≥–∞–π, –ù.–§.

In: Rogovin Frunkel, Edith (ed.), The Soviet Germans: Past and Present. New York: St. Martin's, 1986. During the Soviet-German friendship, there were plans for a visit of Hitler to the Volga Germans ASSR; even flags with swastika had been handed out to the inhabitants. Aftermath =Hitler breaks the Pact= German advances during Operation Barbarossa, 1941-06-22 to 1941-09-09. Anti-Soviet, antisemitic propaganda poster in Nazi Germany Nazi Germany terminated the Molotov‚ÄìRibbentrop Pact with its invasion of the Soviet Union in Operation Barbarossa on June 22, 1941. After the launch of the invasion, the territories that had been gained by the Soviet Union as a result of the Molotov‚ÄìRibbentrop Pact were lost in a matter of weeks. In the three weeks following the breaking of the Pact, the Soviet Union attempted to defend itself against vast German advances; in the process, the Soviet Union suffered 750,000 casualties, and lost 10,000 tanks and 4,000 aircraft. Within six months, the Soviet military had suffered 4.3 million casualties and the Germans had captured three million Soviet prisoners, two million of which would die in German captivity by February 1942. German forces had advanced 1,050 miles (1,690 kilometers), and maintained a linearly-measured front of 1,900 miles (3,058 kilometers).Glantz, David, The Soviet-German War 1941‚Äì45: Myths and Realities: A Survey Essay, October 11, 2001, page 7 =Denial of the Secret Protocol's existence by the Soviet Union= German officials found a microfilmed copy of the secret protocols of the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact in 1945 and provided it to United States military forces. Despite publication of the recovered copy in western media, for decades it was the official policy of the Soviet Union to deny the existence of the secret protocol. After the Baltic Way demonstrations of August 23, 1989, a Soviet commission concluded in December 1989 that the protocol had existed.Dreifeilds, Juris, Latvia in Transition, Cambridge University Press, 1996, , page 34-35 In 1992, only after the dissolution of the Soviet Union, the document itself was declassified. =Post-war commentary regarding the timing of Soviet-German rapprochement= After the war, historians have argued about the start of Soviet-German rapprochement. There are many conflicting points of view in historiography as to when the Soviet side began to seek rapprochement and when the secret political negotiations started.Geoffrey Roberts (1992). \\"The Soviet Decision for a Pact with Nazi Germany\\". Soviet Studies 44.1, 57‚Äì78. Some scholars argue that for a long time the collective security doctrine was a sincere and unanimous position of the Soviet leadership, pursuing a purely defensive line,Roberts, Geoffrey. The Soviet Union and the Origins of the Second World War: Russo-German Relations and the Road to War, 1933‚Äì1941. New York: St. Martin's Press, 1995. whereas others contend that from the very beginning the Soviet Union intended to cooperate with Nazi Germany, collective security being merely tactical counter to some unfriendly German moves.R. C. Raack, Stalin's Drive to the West, 1938‚Äì1945: The Origins of the Cold War (Stanford, California, 1995), p. 12.Robert C. Tucker, Stalin in Power: The Revolution from Above, 1928‚Äì1941 (New York, 1990).Aleksandr M. Nekrich, Pariahs, Partners, Predators: German-Soviet Relations, 1922‚Äì1941. New York: Columbia University Press, 1997. However, perhaps Moscow sought to avoid a great war in Europe because it was not strong enough to fight an offensive war; but there was much disagreement over the policy between Litvinov and Molotov about how to attain that goal, and Stalin alternated between their positions, initially pursuing both contradictory lines simultaneously quite early and abandoning collective security only at some point in 1939.Jonathan Haslam, The Soviet Union and the Struggle for Collective Security in Europe, 1933‚Äì39 (New York, 1985), pp. 140‚Äì141. Nazi Germany started its quest for a pact with the Soviet Union at some point in the spring of 1939 in order to prevent an English‚ÄìSoviet‚ÄìFrench alliance and to secure Soviet neutrality in a future Polish‚ÄìGerman war.Geoffrey Roberts (1992). \\"The Soviet Decision for a Pact with Nazi Germany\\". Soviet Studies 44.1, 57‚Äì78. Some argue that the rapprochement could start as early as in 1935‚Äì1936, when Soviet trade representative in Berlin David Kandelaki made attempts at political negotiations on behalf of Stalin and Molotov, behind Litvinov's back.Haslam, The Soviet Union and the Struggle, p. 86, 127‚Äì128. Molotov's speech to the Central Executive Committee of the Supreme Soviet in January 1936 is usually taken to mark this change of policy.D. C. Watt, 'The Initiation of the Negotiations Leading to the Nazi-Soviet Pact: A Historical Problem', in C. Abramsky, ed., Essays in Honour of E.H. Carr (London, Macmillan, 1974) Thus, Litvinov's anti-German line did not enjoy unanimous support by the Soviet leadership long before his dismissal. Walter Krivitsky, an NKVD agent, who defected in the Netherlands in 1937, reported in his memoires in 1938 that already then Stalin had sought better relations with Germany.–ö—Ä–∏–≤–∏—Ü–∫–∏–π, –í–∞–ª—å—Ç–µ—Ä (1938). –ò–∑ –≤–æ—Å–ø–æ–º–∏–Ω–∞–Ω–∏–π —Å–æ–≤–µ—Ç—Å–∫–æ–≥–æ –∫–æ–º–º—É–Ω–∏—Å—Ç–∞. –°–æ—Ü–∏–∞–ª–∏—Å—Ç–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–∏–π –≤–µ—Å—Ç–Ω–∏–∫ 7, April 15, 1938.W. G. Krivitsky, I Was Stalin's Agent (London, 1940). According to other historians, these were merely responses to German overtures for d√©tente.Roberts, Geoffrey. The Soviet Union and the Origins of the Second World War (London, 1995), chap. 3. It is also possible that the change of foreign policy occurred in 1938, after the Munich Agreement, which became the final defeat of Litvinov's anti-German policy of collective security, which was marked by the reported remark about an inevitable fourth partition of Poland made by Litvinov's deputy Vladimir Potemkin in a conversation with French ambassador Robert Coulondre shortly thereafter.D. C. Watt, 'The Initiation of the Negotiations Leading to the Nazi-Soviet Pact: A Historical Problem', in C. Abramsky, ed., Essays in Honour of E.H. Carr (London, Macmillan, 1974). The turn towards Germany could also have been made in early 1939, marked by Stalin's speech to the 18th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union in March 1939, shortly after the German occupation of Czechoslovakia, when he warned that the Western democracies were trying to provoke a conflict between Germany and the Soviet Union and declared the Soviet Union's non-involvement in inter-capitalist quarrels, which is sometimes considered to have been a signal to Berlin.R.C. Tucker, Stalin in Power: The Revolution from Above, 1928‚Äì1941 (New York, W.W. Norton, 1991). According to others, the first sign of a Soviet‚ÄìGerman political d√©tente was the conversation between Soviet ambassador Aleksey Merekalov and Ernst von Weizs√§cker, State Secretary in the German Foreign Ministry, on April 17, 1939, when the former hinted at possible improvement of the relations. This was followed by a series of perceived German signals of goodwill and the replacement of Litvinov with Molotov.Watt, p. 164. in How War Came: The Immediate Origins of the Second World War (London, Heinemann, 1989)Carr, E. H. (1949) From Munich to Moscow. II. Soviet Studies 1 (2), 93‚Äì105.See Ernst von Weizs√§cker, Memorandum by the State Secretary in the German Foreign Office. April 17, 1939 @ Avalon Project According to Geoffrey Roberts, recently released documents from the Soviet diplomatic files show that western historians have been mistaken in assuming that the Merekalov-Weisz√§cker meeting of April 1939 was the occasion for Soviet signals of a desire for d√©tente with Nazi Germany.Geoffrey Roberts. \\"Infamous Encounter? The Merekalov-Weizsacker Meeting of 17 April 1939\\". The Historical Journal, Vol. 35, No. 4 (Dec. 1992), pp. 921‚Äì926. His point of view, supported by Derek Watson and Jonathan Haslam,Jonathan Haslam. \\"Review: Soviet‚ÄìGerman Relations and the Origins of the Second World War: The Jury Is Still Out\\". The Journal of Modern History, Vol. 69, No. 4 (Dec., 1997), pp. 785‚Äì797 is that it was not until the end of July 1939 ‚Äì August 1939 that the policy change occurred and that it was a consequence rather than a cause of the breakdown of the Anglo- Soviet-French triple alliance negotiations. It must have been clear to Molotov and Stalin in August 1939, that an agreement with Germany avoided an immediate war with that country and could satisfy Soviet territorial ambitions in eastern Poland, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Finland, and Bessarabia; whereas an alliance with Britain and France offered no territorial gains and risked a war with Germany in which the USSR was most likely to bear the brunt of a German attack.

Conditions at these stations were among the worst of all stations in the subway system. Station layout This elevated station has three tracks and two side platforms. The center track is used by the peak direction express service during rush hours. The extreme north (geographical east) end of the northbound platform is a closed work stair leading to a storage area below the tracks. Both platforms have beige windscreens and brown canopies with green support frames and columns in the center and black, waist- high, steel fences at either ends. Black lampposts are at the un-canopied sections at regular intervals and the station signs are in the standard black name plate in white lettering. The Brooklyn-Queens Expressway passes under the IRT Flushing Line just east of the station. There were formerly crossovers and switches between this station and 61st Street‚ÄìWoodside. They were removed in 2008 and replaced with crossovers on either side of 74th Street‚ÄìBroadway. The new crossovers are set up in such a way that trains going in either direction on the express track can stop at 74th Street. Under the elevated structure of the Flushing Line directly east of the station and the Brooklyn-Queens Expressway is a track of the New York Connecting Railroad, which is used for freight by CSX. =Exits= This station has one elevated station house beneath the center of the platforms and tracks.

Both platforms have beige windscreens and brown canopies with green roofs along the entire length except for a small section at the south end, which has only a windscreen on the eastbound side and a waist-high steel fence on the westbound side. This is the southernmost (geographical west) station on the IRT Flushing Line that is on a steel viaduct above Roosevelt Avenue. West of this station, the line curves and becomes a concrete viaduct above Queens Boulevard until 32nd Place. =Exits= This station has two entrances. The full-time one is a wooden elevated station house beneath the tracks at the south end. It has a single staircase to each platform, waiting area that allows free transfer between directions, turnstile bank, token booth, and two staircases to the street, one to each western corner of 52nd Street and Roosevelt Avenue. The other entrance is at the station's extreme north (geographical east) end. A single canopied staircase from each platform goes down a landing outside of a now-closed elevated station house beneath the tracks. A single HEET turnstile provides entrance/exit from the station before a street stair goes down 53rd Street and Roosevelt Avenue. The Manhattan-bound staircase is at the northeast corner while the Flushing-bound one is at the southeast corner.

Edmond de la Fontaine (24 July 1823 ‚Äì 24 June 1891), better known by his pen name of Dicks, was a Luxembourgian jurist, poet, and lyricist, known for his work in the Luxembourgish language. He is considered the national poet of Luxembourg, and along with Michel Lentz and Michel Rodange, one of the most important figures in the history of Luxembourgian literature. In addition, his Luxemburger Sitten und Br√§uche was one of the most influential early ethnographies on the Luxembourgian people. Fontaine was the third son of Gaspard-Th√©odore-Ignace de la Fontaine, who was appointed Governor of Luxembourg in 1841, and subsequently served as the country's first Prime Minister in 1848. Fontaine studied law at Li√®ge, and spent a further year at Heidelberg pursuing Germanic studies from 1844 until 1847, before becoming a lawyer in 1850. From 1867 until 1870, he served as mayor of Stadtbredimus, in eastern Luxembourg's Moselle Valley, and served as a Justice of the Peace in Vianden from 1881 and 1889. He lived in Stadtbredimus Castle from 1858 to 1881 where he would live for the last decade of his life.

Located at the intersection of 46th Street and Queens Boulevard in Sunnyside, Queens, it is served by the 7 train at all times.  History  The Flushing Line was opened from Queensboro Plaza to Alburtis Avenue (now 103rd Street‚ÄìCorona Plaza) on April 21, 1917, with a local station at 46th Street. The platforms at 46th Street were extended in 1955‚Äì1956 to accommodate 11-car trains. In December 2019, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority announced that this station would become ADA-accessible as part of the agency's 2020‚Äì2024 Capital Program. Station layout Entrance from street This elevated station has three tracks and two side platforms. The center track is used by the rush hour peak direction <7> express train. This is the easternmost (railroad north) station on the IRT Flushing Line's concrete viaduct above Queens Boulevard. East of here, the line curves north and becomes elevated over Roosevelt Avenue. Each platform has concrete windscreens painted in beige and green canopies in the center and waist-high beige barriers at either side. The windscreens contain stained glass windows as part of an artwork called \\"Q is For Queens\\" by Yumi Heo installed in 1999. They depict various images related to Heo's children book illustrations. This can also be found on the station's main entrance. =Exits= This station has two entrances/exits, both of which are station houses built within the viaduct's concrete structure. The main one is at the west (geographic south) end of the station and has two staircases and one turnstile bank to each platform, token booth, and four street stairs built within the viaduct's support pillars. These stairs lead to all four corners of 46th Street and the parking lot underneath the viaduct and between the two sides of Queens Boulevard. This entrance does not allow a free transfer between directions (even though it has the layout that could allow one as both turnstile banks lead to the center of the station house). The station's other entrance is unstaffed, containing just HEET and exit-only turnstiles, two staircases to each platform, and two street stairs, also built within the support pillars, going down to either western corners of 47th Street and the parking lot. This entrance has a waiting area that allows a free transfer between directions.  Naming  South side 46th Street was originally named simply Bliss Street after early ferry operator and industrialist Neziah Bliss, whose other namesakes include the nearby neighborhood of Blissville. His name was dropped from the street in the 1920s. The subway station retained the name until 1998, during which time the station name was the inspiration for the electronic band 46bliss. In 1998, the MTA removed it from maps and signage, but by 2003, neighborhood activist Pat Dorfman collected 1,900 signatures, successfully lobbying the MTA and the City Council to restore the old street and station names. The MTA did so in 2004, and the Council added the ceremonial name; street intersection signs near the station now feature a secondary Bliss St plaque.

The metropolis of Mumbai and the cities of Thane and Mira-Bhayander lie on it, making it very populous and one of the most densely populated islands in the world. It has a population approaching 20 million inhabitants living on an area of about . Location Salsette is bounded on the north by Vasai Creek, on the northeast by the Ulhas River, on the east by Thane Creek and Mumbai Harbour, and on the south and west by the Arabian Sea. The original seven islands of Mumbai, which were merged by land reclamation during the 19th and early 20th centuries to form the city of Mumbai, are now practically a southward protruding peninsula of the much larger Salsette Island. The island of Trombay that was to the southeast of Salsette is today part of Salsette as much of the intervening swamps have been reclaimed. It contains Borivali National Park, also known as Sanjay Gandhi National Park. The city of Thane is at the northeastern corner, on Thane Creek, while its suburb Mira-Bhayander lies in the northwest corner. Politically, the Mumbai City district covers the peninsula south of Mahim and Sion while most of the original island constitutes the Mumbai Suburban District. The northern portion lies within Thane District, which extends across Vasai and Thane creeks onto the mainland. History The word Sasashti (also shortened to Sashti) is Marathi for \\"sixty-six,\\" referring to the original \\"sixty-six villages\\" on the island. It was inhabited by (Aagri, Kunbi) farmers, agriculturists, (Bhandaris)toddy tappers, (Sutar, Malis)artisans, and (Kolis)fisherfolks who trace their conversion to Christianity back to 55 AD with the arrival of Christ's disciple St. Bartholomew in north Konkan, west Maharashtra. They were converted to Roman Catholicism by four religious orders‚ÄîDominicans, Franciscans, Augustinians and Jesuits‚Äîwho arrived in the 15th century with the Portuguese. These original natives of Salsette are the East Indian Catholics and Kolis. 109 Buddhist caves, including those at Kanheri, can be found on the island, and date from the end of the 2nd century. Salsette was ruled by a succession of Hindu kingdoms, the last of which were the Silharas and later Maratha Empire. In 1343, the islands were annexed by the Muslim Sultanate of Gujarat. In 1534, the Portuguese took the islands from Sultan Bahadur Shah of Gujarat. Sashti became part of the northern province of Portuguese India, which was governed from Vasai on the north shore of Vasai Creek. It was leased to D. Diogo Rodrigues from 25 October 1535 to 1548. In 1554, the islands were handed over to Garcia de Orta, a renowned physician and botanist and the author of Colloquies on the Simples, Drugs and Materia Medica of India, a seminal work on Indian and Eastern medicine of its time. On the island of Mazagaon, the Jesuits had set up base claiming the land. The Portuguese king refused to entertain their claim and in 1572 permanently leased the island to the de Souza e Lima family. By now, there was a large Roman Catholic population. The Portuguese also brought with them African slaves known as \\"Kaffirs\\", who soon entered the ethnic mix of the people. The Portuguese had established Goa, which lay south of the islands, as their headquarters in India. Goa was then known as the \\"Lisbon of the East\\" and was capital of the Portuguese Indian Vice-Kingdom. Due to its prominence, the islands were never important to the Portuguese. Nine Roman Catholic churches were built on Sashti Island by the Portuguese: Nirmal (1557), Nossa Senhora dos Rem√©dios (1557), Sandor (1566), Agashi (1568), Nandakal (1573), Papdy (1574), Pale (1595), Manickpur (1606), and Nossa Senhora das Merc√™s (1606). The St. Andrews Church and the Mount Mary's Basilica in Bandra, the Cross at Cross Maidan, Gloria Church (1632) in Mazagaon and the remnants of a church in Santa Cruz are the sole places of worship that have survived till today. In 1661, the seven Mumbai islets were ceded to Britain as part of the dowry of Catherine of Bragan√ßa to King Charles II of England while Salsette remained in Portuguese hands. King Charles, in turn, leased the Mumbai islets to the British East India Company in 1668 for ¬£10 per year. The company found the deep harbour at Mumbai eminently apposite, and the population rose from 10,000 in 1661 to 60,000 by 1675. In 1687, the East India Company transferred their headquarters there from Surat. In 1737 the island was captured by the Marathas, and most of the Portuguese northern province was ceded to the Marathas in 1739. The British occupied Salsette in 1774, and it was formally ceded to the East India Company in the 1782 Treaty of Salbai. In 1782, William Hornby, then Governor of Bombay Presidency, initiated the project of connecting the isles of Bombay. By 1845 the seven southern islands had been connected to form South Mumbai, with an area of 435 km¬≤. Railway viaducts and causeways were built in the 19th century to connect Bombay Island to the mainland via Salsette. The channels separating Mumbai from Salsette and Trombay were bridged by the Sion Causeway in 1803. Accessibility considerably increased after construction of this causeway. Mahim and Bandra were connected by the Mahim Causeway in 1845. These railway lines and roads encouraged wealthier merchants to build villas on Salsette Island. By 1901, the population of Salsette had increased to 146,993 and the region began to be referred to as Greater Mumbai. Geography 1893 map showing the island Salsette is dominated by a central mass of hills surrounded by tidal flats. A number of much smaller islands lay on its western flank. These included Bandra, Juhu (an old linear sand bar rising above sea level by just a metre or two), Versova, Marve Island, Dharavi Island and Rai Murdhe, all with a knoll core and fringing wave-cut platforms and sandy beaches. These islands seem to have remained separate until as late as 1808. At the time of writing of the old Gazetteer of Thana in 1882, these islands could be reached during low tides by walking across the tidal inlets in between, except for the island of Dharavi in present-day Gorai (not to be confused with the slum near Mahim), which had to be reached by a boat. These are no longer separate, being joined to Salsette via reclamation. The highest point is the conical peak of Kanheri (467 metres) in Borivali National Park on the northern reaches of the island. This national park is the world's biggest within city limits. =Geology= The island is at the confluence of a number of fault lines. This makes the area earthquake-prone, up to a magnitude of 6. The island is mostly composed of black basalt rock. Since it is along the sea coast, it has a sandy belt on its western coast. The southern region of Old Mumbai is mostly at sea level. However, the parts which were erstwhile shallows are below sea level. Many parts of the city are hilly. There is laterite soil and rocks at a point on Mumbai Island. =Other natural formations= Lakes There are three major lakes on the island: Powai Lake, Tulsi Lake and Vihar Lake. The latter two supply part of Mumbai's water requirements. Numerous other smaller ponds and lakes are present. Rivers The Mithi River (Mahim), Poisar River, Oshiwara River and Dahisar River originate in the national park and empty into the Arabian Sea. The Mithi River originates at Powai Lake. Vasai and Thane creeks are estuarine distributaries of the Ulhas River. Creeks A number of saline or brackish creeks extend inland from the coastline. Mahim Creek separates the city from the suburbs in the west. Further north on the western coast, the Oshiwara river empties into Malad (or Marv√©) Creek and the Dahisar River into Gorai Creek. The eastern waterfront also has many small creeks. Wetlands The small southern part of the eastern waterfront of Salsette forms Mumbai Harbour. North of this region lie vast amounts of protected wetlands at Sewree, home to migratory birds. The northern and northwestern part of the island and parts of Mahim River have government- protected marshlands. These swampy regions form massive, dense mangrove forests.

Early life and career The daughter of general practitioner Dr. William Arthur Bryant, Bryant moved to London with her parents on completing her education. There, she became interested in theatre, and appeared in the chorus lines of various productions before moving on to musical comedies. She also appeared in a number of films, such as The Cure for Love (1949) and Beat Girl with Oliver Reed in 1960. She also appeared in a West End role, as Lucy in Gay's the Word at the Saville Theatre. Bryant also toured in My Mother Said and later appeared in the show's television production. She also appeared in The Bell Family and in films I Get Myself Arrested and The Large Rope. =Coronation Street= Bryant's most notable television role came later in life, playing elderly timid Minnie Caldwell on the soap opera Coronation Street, a role she occupied from 1960 to 1976 over the course of 990 episodes. The character's life tended to revolve around her ginger tom-cat, Bobby. Minnie Caldwell was a diminutive figure, with a distracted manner and often appeared drinking milk stout in the snug of the soap's public house the Rovers Return Inn. The character, consequently, was a put-upon companion of her two friends busybody Martha Longhurst (played by Lynne Carol) and the elderly battleaxe Ena Sharples (played by Violet Carson). Bryant suffered severe memory loss (amnesia) in March 1976, and was unable to continue in the role; her penultimate episode involved her reading her lines off prompts and on props such as her handbag and her final episode was broadcast in April 1976. Her on- screen absence was explained by mentioning that her character had moved to live with an old friend, Handel Gartside (played by Harry Markham) in Derbyshire. Personal life Bryant was a dedicated performer, always insisting on high standards of professionalism and good manners. She was later distressed by her difficulty to learn her lines as her health deteriorated. Ultimately, Bryant was diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease and was admitted to Cheadle Royal Hospital, Heald Green, Cheshire where she remained as an in- patient until her death on New Year's Day 1988, two months before her ninety- first birthday. She never married or had children. She was close friends with fellow Coronation Street actress Eileen Derbyshire. Her character had died off-screen by 2008, when returning former character Jed Stone (played by Kenneth Cope) was seen visiting Minnie's grave.

Jacques graduated from Boston College in 1984 and received her J.D. from Suffolk University Law School in 1987. Jacques was Assistant District Attorney in Middlesex County and Assistant Attorney General of the state. She ran for U.S. Congress, but lost in the Democratic primary to Stephen Lynch. Jacques was the first openly lesbian member of the Massachusetts Senate where she served six terms, and came out as a lesbian during her fourth, citing the statistic that one-third of gay and lesbian teens attempt suicide as part of her motivation for coming out. She was succeeded in the state Senate by Scott Brown. Jacques became president of HRC in 2004, succeeding Elizabeth Birch. She addressed the 2004 Democratic National Convention in this post. She resigned on November 30, 2004, citing \\"a difference in management philosophy\\" with her board, following criticism of the HRC's failure to defeat voter referendums in 11 states banning same-sex marriage and, in some cases, civil unions. After leaving HRC, she was of counsel to the law firm of Brody, Hardoon, Perkins and Kesten and was a consultant on diversity issues to corporations and non-profit organizations. In 2008 Jacques was named a Department of Industrial Accidents Administrative Judge by Governor Deval Patrick. On March 12, 2012 the State Ethics Commission charged her with violating Massachusetts' conflict-of- interest law after she allegedly tried to use her clout as a judge to have a dentist office reduce her brother-in-law's bill. Jacques contended that she never intended to introduce her position, but did so \\"inadvertently\\". The ethics commission found in favor of Jacques on the grounds that the enforcement division failed to prove that Jacques used her official position to intervene in the dispute. In 2013, Jacques and two other administrative judges filed charges with the Massachusetts Commission Against Discrimination, alleging the agency provided a higher salary and a parking space to a male judge appointed after them. In 2014, Governor Patrick chose not to reappoint Jacques, which she alleged was in retaliation for the gender discrimination lawsuit. Personal life In 2004, Jacques married Jennifer Chrisler. They have three sons.

B. > Pearson, Opening Ceremonies for the Confederation Centre of the Arts, > October 6, 1964 The centre has played host to the Charlottetown Festival every summer since 1965, playing Canada's most popular and longest-running mainstage musical Anne of Green Gables ‚Äî The Musical. It also inspired the production of the musical, Anne and Gilbert. Their most successful second mainstage show to date is Mamma Mia!. The centre was designated a National Historic Sites of Canada in 2003. In 2011 the mainstage Homburg Theatre underwent a $7-million renovation to improve acoustics, seating, lighting, and rigging. The project was completed in time for the Centre's 50th anniversary in 2014. Architecture Confederation Centre was built on Queen's Square in the centre of Charlottetown's business district, immediately west of Province House, Prince Edward Island's legislature and the location of the Charlottetown Conference. The centre is one contiguous structure, however at street level it appears as three separate buildings (hosting a theatre, art gallery and public library) clustered around \\"Memorial Hall\\" which faces east toward Province House. The Confederation Chambre in Province House, where the conference meetings took place, is located on the western side of that building, thus facing directly at Confederation Centre's Memorial Hall. Confederation Centre covers a block in the central business district, bounded on three sides by Grafton Street, Queen Street, and Richmond Street. The structure houses an art museum, public library, and several performing arts venues. It also includes a public library administered under the provincial library system and is Charlottetown's principal library. Mavor's Restaurant is located right off the lobby and hosts a wide selection of wines. =Art museum= Exterior of the Confederation Centre Art Gallery portion of the building. Opened at the same time as the rest of the structure, the Confederation Centre Art Gallery is an art museum in the northeast pavilion of the Confederation Centre of the Arts. The art gallery pavilion is housed in a three-storey structure, that includes over of exhibition space. As of June 2017, it held over 17,000 works in its permanent collection. =Theatres= The Confederation Centre of the Arts includes a number of venues for the performing arts. These include a 1,109 seat mainstage theatre, the largest theatre mainstage in Canada east of Montreal; and two studio theatres.

Settlements of South Mumbai South Mumbai is the Mumbai City district which is the southernmost precinct of Greater Mumbai. It extends from Colaba to Mahim. It comprises the city's main business localities, making it the wealthiest urban precinct in India. Property prices in South Mumbai are by far the highest in India and among the highest in the world. Notably Cumballa Hill, Cuffe Parade, Malabar Hill, Breach Candy, Altamount Road-Kemps Corner as well as some parts of Worli are constantly ranked in the Global Property Index. Billionaire Mukesh Ambani's $1.5 billion home Antilia is located here and is now a part of the iconic skyline. Most residents of South Mumbai belong to old money business, law, trade and fashion families. Geographically, South Mumbai lies at the southern corner of Salsette Island. Most city residents use the term to refer to the stretch extending from Colaba to Mahim and Sion as South Mumbai. The area is delimited on the east by Mumbai harbour and on the west by the Arabian Sea. South Mumbai is also home to the most prestigious schools; namely The Cathedral & John Connon School, JB Petit, Campion, Bombay International, St Mary's I.C.S.E. etc. ; the most exclusive sports clubs: CCI, The Willingdon Sports Club as well as Bombay Gymkhana and the most expensive hospitals: Breach Candy Hospital, Bombay Hospital, Jaslok Hospital and Hurkisondas Hospital; in the nation. Significance South Mumbai hosts the Reserve Bank of India, Bombay Stock Exchange and one of the oldest YMCA buildings. Its primary business districts are the Fort, Nariman Point, Ballard Estate and more recently Lower Parel, Mumbai Central. Many leading Indian and multi-national companies are headquartered here. Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Terminus (CSTM) and Churchgate serve as headquarters and starting point for country's Central Railway and Western Railway lines respectively. The headquarters of the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation, the governing civic body of Greater Mumbai is located in South Mumbai. The Bombay High Court is also in South Mumbai. The area houses a significant proportion of prime upmarket residential neighbourhoods of Mumbai including: Pedder Road, Nepean Sea Road, Kemps Corner, Altamount Road, Carmichael Road, Breach Candy and Walkeshwar Road, forming a sort of golden quadrilateral and includes some of the most expensive residential areas in the world, such as the Hanging Gardens, Kemps Corner, Cuffe Parade and Malabar Hill. South Mumbai is home to two UNESCO World Heritage Sites: Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Terminus and the city's distinctive ensemble of Victorian and Art Deco buildings. South Mumbai's architecture comprises many Victorian, Gothic, Art Deco style buildings, structures and historical monuments from the colonial era which attract tourists throughout the year. South Mumbai has reputed and leading educational institutions such as Jamnalal Bajaj Institute of Management Studies, St. Xavier's College, Government Law College, Jai Hind College, Wilson College, Grant Medical College, Sydenham Institute of Management Studies, Research and Entrepreneurship Education to name a few. Many distinctive sporting clubs have been an integral part of South Mumbai landscape like the Willingdon Sports Club, the Turf Club at Mahalaxmi Racecourse, the Bombay Gymkhana, the Breach Candy Club, the N.S.C.I, and the Malabar Hill Club (Formerly W.I.A.A Club). The Cricket Club of India (CCI) and Mumbai Cricket Association (MCA) are located at Mumbai's two cricket stadiums, namely Brabourne Stadium and Wankhede Stadium respectively. Although land reclamation has allowed the southernmost tip of the district to double in size since the 1970s, the business districts face an acute shortage of real estate. As a result, the real-estate prices are among the top ten worldwide. As a ratio to average per capita income, real-estate prices in the business districts remain the most expensive in the world. South Mumbai is also the home to several of the city's sporting grounds, including Brabourne Stadium, Wankhede Stadium, Shivaji Park, Azad Maidan, Oval Maidan and Cooperage Ground. Mumbai's most popular beach, Girgaon Chowpatty is located at the beginning of a 3.6 km esplanade known as the Marine Drive which is a popular hangout spot among the citizens. Another popular esplanade in South Mumbai is the Worli Seaface. South Mumbai also has popular art galleries and museums like Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Vastu Sangrahalaya, Jehangir Art Gallery, Nehru Centre Art Gallery. Ethnically, South Mumbai continues to be dominated by the diverse communities of the ethnic population. South Mumbai has become less congested with the creation of the Bandra Worli Sea Link. Auto rickshaws are strictly banned here. This facilitates quicker transport between people residing in the suburbs and the corporate offices in South Mumbai. Traffic is a major concern in most parts. South Mumbai is one of India's most diverse areas since it contains a variety of eating options from 5-star hotels to street food. Being connected to the coast has also made it a very important port for business. Division The city of Mumbai lies on Salsette Island. Administratively it has two official divisions: Mumbai City district and Mumbai Suburban district. Mumbai City district consists of the Southern part of Salsette Island - the area is called South Mumbai. Mumbai Suburban district consists the Western, Eastern, Central and Northern parts of the city. The Northernmost portion of the island - outside Mumbai city limits - lies in Thane district. Old Mumbai Mumbai in 1909 Old Mumbai was used to refer to the area which was formed by the merging of the seven original islands of Mumbai, India. The term was used from the 19th century until the 1980s and is now considered archaic, however still widely used.

He represented Texas's 20th congressional district in the U.S. House of Representatives from 1999 to 2013. He served as Chairman of Latinos for Obama and National Co-Chair of President Obama's 2012 re-election campaign. Early life, education, and legal career Gonzalez was born in San Antonio, Texas, the son of Bertha Marie (n√©e Cuellar) and Henry B. Gonzalez, who represented the 20th from 1961 until his son took over in 1999. His parents, of Mexican descent, were both Texas-born. Charlie graduated from Thomas A. Edison High School. He received his bachelor's degree in government from the University of Texas at Austin in 1969, and then later earned his Juris Doctor degree from St. Mary's University in San Antonio in 1972. As a youth, he was a Boy Scout in Troop 90 of San Antonio. His father was the Scoutmaster. Gonzalez served as a technical sergeant in the Texas Air National Guard from 1969 until 1975. He then began practicing law until 1982 when he began rising through the ranks of the court system. He served first as a municipal court judge, then later as a judge in county and then district court, both of which are elected positions. U.S. House of Representatives =Elections= Henry Gonzalez, of Texas's 20th congressional district, had long groomed his son as his successor. When his father didn't seek a full 19th term in 1998, Charlie ran for the seat. In a crowded seven-way Democratic primary, Gonzalez led the field with 44%, missing the 50% threshold to avoid a run-off. In that election, he defeated San Antonio City Councilwoman Maria Antonietta Berriozabal 62%-38%. In the general election, he defeated Republican James Walker 63%-36%. He became only the fourth person to represent the 20th District since its creation in 1935. In fact, Charlie's first race was the first open-seat race in the district's 64-year history. However, he had effectively assured himself of succeeding his father with his primary win. The 20th is a heavily Democratic, majority-Hispanic district; the Republicans have only put up nominal candidates in this district since Henry won it in a 1961 special election. Charlie kept this tradition going. He was re-elected six more times, and never won re-election with less than 63% of the vote. He only faced a Republican challenger three times, in 2004, 2008 and 2010. He had no major-party opposition in 2000 and 2006 and was completely unopposed in 2002. He decided to retire and not seek another term in 2012. =Tenure= Charlie Gonzalez is a member of the New Democrat Coalition. He is generally seen as less confrontational than his father, who once punched someone for calling him a communist. Between them, the father and son represented the 20th for 52 consecutive years; the only father and son combination to serve longer in the House has been the Dingells of Michigan, who have represented the state's 15th District for 80 consecutive years. Rep. Gonzalez was one of the first congressmen to actively support Barack Obama in the 2008 Democratic presidential primary. \\"Senator Obama brings all these new fresh faces,‚Äô‚Äô Gonzalez told the San Antonio Express-News. \\"He has a wider audience. He has the greater potential to engage a greater number of people.‚Äô‚Äô Gonzalez announced on November 25, 2011, that he would not seek reelection in the 2012 congressional elections.

A military marine mammal is a cetacean or pinniped that has been trained for military uses. Examples include bottlenose dolphins, seals, sea lions and belugas. The United States and Soviet militaries have trained and employed oceanic dolphins for various uses. Military dolphins have been trained to rescue lost naval swimmers or to swim head first into active deep sea mines.  Dolphins  = Soviet Union Navy dolphins = The Soviet Navy operated a research facility to explore military uses of marine mammals at Kazachya Bukhta, near Sevastopol. The Russian military's military dolphin program is believed to have languished in the early 1990s.  Russian Federation, Ukraine and Iran  After the fall of the Soviet Union, the Soviet military dolphin program was passed to the Ukrainian Navy. In March 2000 the BBC reported that the Ukrainian navy had transferred their military dolphin project from Sevastopol to Iran. Iran bought the animals and the chief trainer carried on his research at their new oceanarium. In 2012, Ukraine allegedly \\"resurrected\\" the military dolphin program. After the 2014 annexation of Crimea, the Ukrainian dolphin program was taken over by Russia. Conflicting statements have been made regarding the fate of the dolphins. One claim is that the program had been demilitarized prior to the annexation, with all military dolphins either sold commercially or dead by natural causes. A counter-claim suggests that dolphins died patriotically after going on hunger strikes and resisting their Russian captors. Russia reportedly intended to used advanced technology to visualise the dolphin's biosonar signals in future military dolphin research. Government public records show that in 2016, five bottlenose dolphins were purchased by the Russian defence ministry from Moscow‚Äôs Utrish Dolphinarium. =United States Navy dolphins= The U.S. Navy trains dolphins and sea lions under the U.S. Navy Marine Mammal Program, which is based in San Diego, California. They get some of their dolphins from the Gulf of Mexico. Military dolphins were used by the U.S. Navy during the First and Second Gulf Wars, and their use dates back to the Vietnam War. About 75 dolphins were in the program circa 2007, and around 70 dolphins and 30 sea lions were reported to be in the program in 2019. The United States Navy implemented a program in 1960 to work with dolphins and sea lions in order to help with defense, mine detection, and the design of new submarines and new underwater weapons. The Navy did many tests with several marine mammals to determine which would be best for the jobs they needed done, with \\"more than 19 species...including some sharks and birds\\" tested, though the bottlenose dolphin and California sea lion were considered the best at what the Navy needed them for. The bottlenose dolphins' asset was their highly evolved biosonar, helping to find underwater mines, and the sea lions' asset was their impeccable underwater vision, which can help to detect enemy swimmers. In fiscal year 2007, the United States Navy spent $14 million on research on marine mammals as weapons and marine mammal training programs in object recovery and mine detection and have 75 trained dolphins. Dolphins have contributed to saving more lives in open water than specially trained life savers. In 2005, there were press reports that some U.S. military dolphins based on Lake Pontchartrain had escaped during the Hurricane Katrina flooding. The U.S. Navy dismissed these stories as nonsense or a hoax, though they may be taking on the status of an urban myth. A bottlenose dolphin responding to its trainer's hand gestures. Care of animals The marine mammals used for the Navy's research and operations are cared for by a full-time staff of veterinarians, veterinarian technicians, and highly trained marine biologists. Training The dolphins and sea lions are trained by five teams of the Navy's Marine Mammal fleet members. One team specializes in swimmer detection, three teams in mine location, and another team in object recoveries. The quick-response goal of this fleet is to mobilize a team and be on site within 72 hours. Dolphins are trained much as police dogs and hunting dogs are. They are given rewards such as fish on correct completion of a task. Dolphins are trained to detect underwater mines and enemy swimmers and then report back to their handlers.Frequently Asked Questions of the U.S. Navy Marine Mammal Program Rumours that dolphins had been trained to kill divers have been denied by the US Navy, which claims that training dolphins to fight or kill humans is impossible. Retired US Admiral Tim Keating claimed that military dolphins could be used to detect mines in the Strait of Hormuz, after Iran threatened to close the waterway in January 2012.  Seals and sea lions  Seals and sea lions are trained and utilised by the US Navy and the Russian Navy. In Russia, dolphins and seals have been trained to carry tools for divers and detect torpedoes, mines, and other ammunition to working depths of up to 120 metres. Seals are considered better suited than belugas for military use in polar conditions due to their \\"high professionalism\\" and ability to learn, retain and understand oral commands.  Belugas  In 2019, a beluga was found off the coast of Norway that was believed to have most likely been trained by the Russian Navy. The beluga was wearing a harness that was labeled \\"Equipment of St. Petersburg\\", seemed comfortable around humans and attempted to pull ropes from the sides of a Norwegian fishing vessel. Beluga research was conducted by the Murmansk Sea Biology Research Institute in northern Russia on behalf of the Russian Navy. Experiments were conducted to determine whether belugas could be used to ‚Äúguard entrances to naval bases‚Äô‚Äù in arctic regions and ‚Äúassist deepwater divers and if necessary kill any strangers who enter their territory‚Äù. The research concluded that dolphins and seals were better suited to military use in polar conditions than belugas.

He won the riding in the 1930 election, again having contested it as a \\"Progressive-Conservative\\" and served for five years as a backbench supporter of R.B. Bennett's Conservative government. In 1932, outside politics, Willis was a member of the Canadian curling team that won a gold medal in the curling event at the 1932 Winter Olympics. He was defeated in the 1935 election, losing by three votes to the Liberal candidate. Willis was acclaimed as leader of the provincial Conservative Party on June 9, 1936, replacing W. Sanford Evans. He was elected for the riding of Deloraine in a provincial election held later in the year. The election of 1936 was very close, with John Bracken's Liberal-Progressives winning 23 seats in the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba and Willis's Conservatives winning 16. Another 16 seats were won by smaller parties. There were rumours of a Bracken-Willis coalition after the election, but this plan was rejected by the Conservative leader. After the start of World War II, the idea of an all-party coalition was revived by Bracken's government. The Conservatives, Social Credit and the Cooperative Commonwealth Federation joined Bracken's Liberal-Progressives in a \\"non- partisan government\\", meant to demonstrate the united resolve of the province. Willis was sworn in as Minister of Public Works on November 4, 1940. When CCF leader Seymour Farmer resigned in 1942, Willis also became Minister of Labour, holding this position until 1944. The coalition was generally advantageous to the Conservative Party, which was renamed the Progressive Conservative (PC) Party in the mid-1940s. Its ministers were allowed a fair degree of autonomy, and were fully integrated into the province's governing structure, unlike the CCF and Social Credit ministers, who were marginalized. The party maintained an identity separate from the Liberal-Progressives throughout this period. In a 1946 manifesto, its members pledged to support an increase in old-age pensions, a decrease in tariff rates, and further transportation openings to the province's north. Willis, supported by the Liberal-Progressives, was re- elected by acclamation in 1941, 1945 and 1949. There were some Progressive Conservatives who opposed the coalition, particularly after Liberal- Progressive Member of the Legislative Assembly (MLA) Douglas Campbell became the province's premier in 1948. The Conservatives had nominated Willis to be premier, but Campbell defeated him in a vote among coalition MLAs. Campbell's philosophy of \\"minimal government\\" was rejected by the more progressive figures in the PC ranks, the most vocal of whom was Dufferin Roblin (grandson of former Premier Sir Rodmond Roblin). In 1949, Roblin was elected to the legislature for Winnipeg South as an anti-coalition Progressive Conservative. Under pressure from his party and disturbed by the Campbell government's inaction on various issues, Willis resigned from cabinet on August 19, 1950. At a party convention in October, the Progressive Conservatives voted 215 to 17 to leave the coalition. Willis, who also fended off a leadership challenge from George Hastings at the convention, once again became leader of the opposition. Willis was re-elected for Turtle Mountain in the provincial election of 1953, but the provincial Progressive Conservative organization was weak, and Campbell's Liberal-Progressives won a decisive majority. MLA J. Arthur Ross forced a leadership convention in 1954; at this convention, Roblin defeated Willis to become party leader. Willis continued as a member of the legislature after this loss. He was re-elected in 1958, and served in Roblin's minority government as Minister of Public Works, Minister of Agriculture and Deputy Premier. Re-elected again in 1959, he continued to serve in cabinet until January 15, 1960, when he was appointed as the province's lieutenant governor. He remained in this position until August 31, 1965. Death Willis died in Winnipeg on January 9, 1967.

It is located near Wednesbury and Willenhall. Topography River Tarne, DarlastonDarlaston is situated between Wednesbury and Walsall in the valley of the River Tame in the angle where the three major head-streams of the river converge. It is located on the South Staffordshire Coalfield and has been an area of intense coal-mining activity. The underlying coal reserves were most likely deposited in the Carboniferous Period. Disused coal mines are found near Queen Street in Moxley, behind Pinfold street JMI School, near Hewitt Street and Wolverhampton Street, in George Rose Park and behind the police station in Victoria Park. Mining subsidence, which has taken its toll on many buildings across central England, has also made its mark in Darlaston. In 1999, a council house on the New Moxley housing estate collapsed down a disused mineshaft, it's occupant, an elderly gentleman had complained of creaking and groaning in the house to neighbors who alerted the authorities who intern instructed him to leave, a few hours later it collapsed down the mine. The adjoining house also had to be knocked down. History Historic town centre, DarlastonThe ancient origins of the town are now very obscure due to the archive record being relatively recent. Any archaeological evidence has been largely destroyed due to intensive coal mining during the 18th and 19th centuries. A possible Saxon castle probably existed at Darlaston, which eventually became a timber castle.King, D.J.C., 1983, Castellarium Anglicanum (London: Kraus) Vol. 2 p. 452 No remains exist today. Between the 12th and 15th centuries the de Darlaston family were the landowners, When the de Darlaston family died out, the manor was taken over by the Hayes family and was known as Great Croft. Darlaston's location on the South Staffordshire Coalfield led to the early development of coal mining and associated industrial activities. At first such activity was relatively small scale requiring only a copyhold permission from the lord of the manor. So, for example, in 1698 Timothy Woodhouse was manager of the coal mines belonging to Mrs. Mary Offley, then the lady of the manor. In the first year, he sold 3,000 sacks of coal and later went into partnership in his own business. Notable beneficiaries of nineteenth-century industrialisation were the Rose family whose fortune had been made by astute enclosure of common land. Upon the death of Richard Rose in 1870 his estate was valued at over ¬£877. He bequeathed the land to his wife Hannah. His brother was James Rose, shown in the 1871 census as a latch, bolt and nut maker, employing 39 people, including 19 children. By the time of the 1881 census, James Rose was 55 and his business had expanded to employ 90 people. James Rose died in 1901. Rapid industrial growth in the early decades of the 19th century brought with it problems of housing poverty and deprivation. In December 1839, the rector of the parish reported that there were approximately 1,500 homes in the parish of Darlaston, most of which were in poor condition and owned by working-class people. In 1841 the town had a population of 6,000. Development was driven by the presence of excellent transport links: the Birmingham Canal Navigations and Grand Junction Railway. Much of the mining land was owned by the Birmingham Coal Company. Artist Thomas F. Worrall was born in the Woods Bank area in 1872, where his father worked as a blacksmith. On 1 January 1895 Darlaston became an urban district, and the local board became Darlaston Urban District Council. In 1966, Darlaston became part of Walsall and in 1974, it became part of the metropolitan county of the West Midlands. Darlaston was subject to a number of bombing raids in World War II. A Luftwaffe bombing on 5 June 1941 wrecked several council houses in Lowe Avenue, Rough Hay, and killed 11 people. The bomb had been aimed at Rubery Owen's factory but missed by some distance. The houses were later rebuilt. Many Victorian terraced houses were demolished during the second half of the 20th century, and the Urban District Council of Darlaston built thousands of houses and flats to replace them with. From 1966 Darlaston was administered by Walsall borough and is now in the WS10 postal district which also includes neighbouring Wednesbury. However, since 1999 the council-owned housing stock has been controlled by Darlaston Housing Trust. In 2001 two of the town's four multi-storey blocks of flats were demolished, and the remaining two were demolished in 2004. . By the end of the 1980s most of the industry in the town had closed and the town is now considered a ghost town, with an increasing high level of unemployment. In 2011 a total of 15 derelict sites in the town were designated as enterprise zones offering tax breaks and relaxed planning laws to any businesses interested in setting up bases in the selected areas. These enterprise zones are expected to create thousands of jobs and ease the town's long running unemployment crisis, which has deepened since 2008 as a result of the recession. Education The town is served by one large secondary school, Grace Academy, which until 2009 was known as Darlaston Comprehensive School. It is situated in the west of the town near the border with Bilston.

The dam and Hydroelectric power plant were constructed by and are currently operated by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. History & background Fort Randall Dam was authorized by the Flood Control Act of 1944 and plays a key role in the Pick-Sloan Plan for development of water resources in the Missouri River basin. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers began construction of the dam in 1946, and was the first Pick-Sloan dam completed by the Omaha District. President Dwight D. Eisenhower threw the switch that started the first power generating unit in 1954. When completed in 1956, Fort Randall Dam and the Lake Francis Case Project cost approximately $200 million. U.S. Route 18 and U.S. Route 281 cross the crest of the dam. The dam is just over north of the Nebraska state line. The Fort Randall Dam is located within sight of its namesake Fort Randall, an early U.S. Army Frontier Post. Fort Randall Dam is one of six Missouri River mainstem dams, the next dam upstream is Big Bend Dam, near Ft. Thompson and the next dam downstream is Gavins Point Dam, near Yankton. Hydroelectric Power The eight generating units of the Fort Randall Dam are capable of generating 40 megawatts of electricity each, with an annual production of 1.727 billion kilowatt hours. The combined maximum capacity of 320 megawatts is enough to supply 245,000 households, according to the Corps of Engineers. The river behind the dam drains an area of 263,480 mi¬≤ (682,410 km¬≤). Its reservoir, Lake Francis Case, has a surface area of at maximum operating pool, coinciding with a volume of .  2011 Missouri River Flood In June 2011, in response to the 2011 Missouri River Floods, the dam was releasing over , which greatly exceeded its previous record release of set in 1997.

It is usually covered by enamel on the crown and cementum on the root and surrounds the entire pulp. By volume, 45% of dentin consists of the mineral hydroxylapatite, 33% is organic material, and 22% is water. Yellow in appearance, it greatly affects the color of a tooth due to the translucency of enamel. Dentin, which is less mineralized and less brittle than enamel, is necessary for the support of enamel.Johnson, Clarke. \\"Biology of the Human Dentition .\\" Page accessed July 18, 2007. Dentin rates approximately 3 on the Mohs scale of mineral hardness.Marshall GW Jr, Marshall SJ, Kinney JH, Balooch M.J. The dentin substrate: structure and properties related to bonding J Dent. 1997 Nov;25(6):441-58. There are two main characteristics which distinguish dentin from enamel: firstly, dentin forms throughout life; secondly, dentin is sensitive.Berkovits BKB, Holland GR, Moxham BJ. (2002). Oral Anatomy, Histology and Embryology. Mosby. 3rd edn. pp. 125. . Dentinal sclerosis/transparent dentin-sclerosis of primary dentin is regressive alteration in tooth characterized by calcification of dentinal tubules. It can occur as a result of injury to dentin by caries or abrasion, or as part of the normal aging process. Dentinal-sclerosis Development The formation of dentin, known as dentinogenesis, begins prior to the formation of enamel and is initiated by the odontoblasts of the pulp. Dentin is derived from the dental papilla of the tooth germ. The tooth germ is the primordial structures from which a tooth is formed, including the enamel organ, the dental papilla, and the dental sac enclosing them.tooth bud. 2012. Medical Dictionary for the Health Professions and Nursing. Farlex. After growth of predentin and maturation into dentin, the cell bodies of the odontoblasts remain in the pulp inside the tooth, along its outer wall, and project into tiny tubules in the dentin. Dentin continues to form throughout life and can be initiated in response to stimuli, such as tooth decay or attrition. Structure Unlike enamel, dentin may be demineralized and stained for histological study. dentin consists of microscopic channels, called dentinal tubules, which radiate outward through the dentin from the pulp to the exterior cementum or enamel border.Ross, Michael H., Gordon I. Kaye, and Wojciech Pawlina, 2003. Histology: a text and atlas. 4th edition. Page 450. . The dentinal tubules extend from the dentinoenamel junction (DEJ) in the crown area, or dentinocemental junction (DCJ) in the root area, to the outer wall of the pulp.Illustrated Dental Embryology, Histology, and Anatomy, Bath-Balogh and Fehrenbach, Elsevier, 2011, page 156. From the outer surface of the dentin to the area nearest the pulp, these tubules follow an S-shaped path. The diameter and density of the tubules are greatest near the pulp.Cate, A.R. Ten. Oral Histology: development, structure, and function. 5th ed. 1998. Page 152. . Tapering from the inner to the outermost surface, they have a diameter of 2.5 Œºm near the pulp, 1.2 Œºm in the middle of the dentin, and 0.9 Œºm at the dentino-enamel junction. Their density is 59,000 to 76,000 per square millimeter near the pulp, whereas the density is only half as much near the enamel. Within the tubules, there is an odontoblast process, which is an extension of an odontoblast, and dentinal fluid, which contains a mixture of albumin, transferrin, tenascin and proteoglycans.Palosaari, Heidi. Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and their specific tissue inhibitors (TIMPs) in mature human odontoblasts and pulp tissue. Institute of Dentistry, University of Oulu. Page accessed July 18, 2007. In addition, there are branching canalicular systems that connect to each other. These branches have been categorized by size, with major being 500-1000 nm in diameter, fine being 300-700 nm, and micro being less than 300 nm.Cate, A.R. Ten. Oral Histology: development, structure, and function. 5th ed. 1998. Page 155. . The major branches are the terminal ends of the tubules. About every 1-2 Œºm, there are fine branches diverging from dentinal tubules at 45 degree angles. The microtubules diverge at 90 degree angles. The dentinal tubules contain the cytoplasmic extensions of odontoblasts that once formed the dentin and maintain it. The cell bodies of the odontoblasts are aligned along the inner aspect of dentin against a layer of predentin where they also form the peripheral boundary of the dental pulp.Marshall GW Jr. Dentin: microstructure and characterization. Quintessence Int. 1993 Sep;24(9):606-17. Because of dentinal tubules, dentin has a degree of permeability, which can increase the sensation of pain and the rate of tooth decay. The strongest held theory of dentinal hypersensitivity suggests that it is due to changes in the dentinal fluid associated with the processes, a type of hydrodynamic mechanism.Addy M. Dentine Hypersensitivity. New perspectives on an old problem. Int Dent J (2002) 52; 367-375. Dentin is a bone-like matrix that is porous and yellow- hued material. It is made up, by weight, of 72% inorganic materials (mainly hydroxylapatite and some non-crystalline amorphous calcium phosphate), 20% organic materials (90% of which is collagen type 1 and the remaining 10% ground substance, which includes dentin-specific proteins), and 8% water (which is adsorbed on the surface of the minerals or between the crystals).Hillson, S. Teeth. 2nd ed. 2005. Page 184. . Because it is softer than enamel, it decays more rapidly and is subject to severe cavities if not properly treated, but due to its elastic properties, it is good support for enamel. Its flexibility prevents the brittle enamel fracturing. In areas where both primary and secondary mineralization have occurred with complete crystalline fusion, these appear as lighter rounded areas on a stained section of dentin and are considered globular dentin. In contrast, the darker arc-like areas in a stained section of dentin are considered interglobular dentin. In these areas, only primary mineralization has occurred within the predentin, and the globules of dentin do not fuse completely. Thus, interglobular dentin is slightly less mineralized than globular dentin. Interglobular dentin is especially evident in coronal dentin, near the dentinoenamel junction (DEJ), and in certain dental anomalies, such as in dentinogenesis imperfecta. = Regional variations in dentin structure and composition = The different regions in dentin can be recognized due to their structural differences. The outermost layer, known as the mantle dentin layer, is found in the crown of the tooth. It can and can be identified by the presence of various characteristics, including collagen fibres found perpendicular to the enamel- dentin junction and it is slightly less mineralized (by approximately 5%, compared to the enamel. The dentin undergoes mineralization in the presence of matrix vesicles (\\"hydroxyapatite-containing, membrane-enclosed vesicles secreted by odontoblasts, osteoblasts, and some chondrocytes; believed to serve as nucleation centers for the mineralization process in dentin, bone, and calcified cartilage.\\")matrix vesicles. 2012. Farlex Partner Medical Dictionary. Farlex. The dentinal tubules in this region branch profusely. In the root of the tooth there are two morphologically distinguishable outer layers: the hyaline layer on the periphery of dentin and the granular layer of Tomes beneath this. The granular layer has a dark, granular appearance which occurs due to the branching and looping back of dentinal tubules in this region. This appearance, specific to root dentin, is possibly due to differences in the rates of formation of coronal and root dentin. The hyaline layer, which has an obscure origin, is a clear layer, unlike the granular layer, with a width of up to 20Œºm. It can have clinical significance during periodontal regeneration. Circumpulpal dentin forms the majority of the dentin and is generally constant in structure. Peripherally, mineralization can be seen to be incomplete, whereas centrally the mineralizing front shows ongoing mineralizing. The innermost layer of dentin is known as predentin, and is the initial dentin matrix that is laid down prior to mineralization. It can be distinguished by its pale color when stained with haematoxylin and eosin. The presence of odontoblastic processes here allows the secretion of matrix components. Predentin can be 10-40Œºm in width, depending on its rate of deposition.Berkovits BKB, Holland GR, Moxham BJ. (2002). Oral Anatomy, Histology and Embryology. Mosby. 3rd edn. pp. 134-137. . Types There are three types of dentin, primary, secondary and tertiary.U. Zilberman, P. Smith. Sex- and Age-related Differences in Primary and Secondary Dentin Formation Advances in Dental Research, Vol 15, Issue 1, pp.42-45, August 2001. Retrieved from iadrjournals.orgDonna J. Phinney, Judy Helen Halstead Delmar's Dental Assisting: A Comprehensive Approach, p.97, Thomson Delmar Learning, Secondary dentin is a layer of dentin produced after the root of the tooth is completely formed. Tertiary dentin is created in response to a stimulus, such as a carious attack or wear. =Primary dentin= Primary dentin, the most prominent dentin in the tooth, lies between the enamel and the pulp chamber (near dentinoenamel junction). The outer layer closest to enamel is known as mantle dentin. This layer is unique to the rest of primary dentin. Mantle dentin is formed by newly differentiated odontoblasts and forms a layer consistently 15-20 micrometers (¬µm) wide. Unlike primary dentin, mantle dentin lacks phosphorylation, has loosely packed collagen fibrils and is less mineralized. Below it lies the circumpulpal dentin, more mineralized dentin which makes up most of the dentin layer and is secreted after the mantle dentin by the odontoblasts. Circumpulpal dentin is formed before the root formation is completed. Newly secreted dentin is unmineralized and is called predentin. It is easily identified in hematoxylin and eosin stained sections since it stains less intensely than dentin. It is usually 10-47Œºm and lines the innermost region of the dentin. It is unmineralized and consists of collagen, glycoproteins, and proteoglycans. It is similar to osteoid in bone and is thickest when dentinogenesis is occurring.Ten Cate's Oral Histology, Nanci, Elsevier, 2013, page 194 = Secondary dentin = Secondary dentin (adventitious dentin) is formed after root formation is complete, normally after the tooth has erupted and is functional. It grows much more slowly than primary dentin but maintains its incremental aspect of growth. It has a similar structure to primary dentin, although its deposition is not always even around the pulp chamber. It is the growth of this dentin that causes a decrease in the size of the pulp chamber with age. This is clinically known as pulp recession; cavity preparation in young patients, therefore, carries a greater risk of exposing the pulp. If this occurs, the pulp can be treated by different therapies such as direct pulp capping. Pulp capping is most successful if followed by a stainless steel crown. In order to maintain space in the primary dentition, attempts are made not to extract a pulpal exposure. =Tertiary dentin (including reparative dentin or sclerotic dentin) ‚Äì pathologic= Tertiary dentin is dentin formed as a reaction to external stimulation such as cavities and wear. It is of two types, either reactionary, where dentin is formed from a pre-existing odontoblast, or reparative, where newly differentiated odontoblast-like cells are formed due to the death of the original odontoblasts, from a pulpal progenitor cell. Tertiary dentin is only formed by an odontoblast directly affected by a stimulus; therefore, the architecture and structure depend on the intensity and duration of the stimulus, e.g., if the stimulus is a carious lesion, there is extensive destruction of dentin and damage to the pulp, due to the differentiation of bacterial metabolites and toxins. Thus, tertiary dentin is deposited rapidly, with a sparse and irregular tubular pattern and some cellular inclusions; in this case, it is referred to as \\"osteodentin\\". Osteodentin is seen in Vit.A deficiency during development. However, if the stimulus is less active, it is laid down less rapidly with a more regular tubular pattern and hardly any cellular inclusions.J.H. Kinney, R.K. Nallab, J.A. Pople, T.M. Breunig, R.O. Ritchie, Age-related transparent root dentin: mineral concentration, crystallite size, and mechanical properties, Biomaterials. (2005) 3363‚Äì3376 at http://www.lbl.gov/ritchie/Library/PDF/Biomaterials(transparent-dentin).pdf The speed at which tertiary dentin forms also varies substantially among primate species. Animal dentin Elephant ivory is solid dentin. The structure of the dentinal tubules contributes to both its porosity and its elasticity. Elephant tusks are formed with a thin cap of enamel, which soon wears away, leaving the dentin exposed. Exposed dentin in humans causes the symptom of sensitive teeth. Because dentin is softer than enamel, it wears away more quickly than enamel. Some mammalian teeth exploit this phenomenon, especially herbivores such as horses, deer or elephants. In many herbivores, the occlusal (biting) surface of the tooth is composed of alternating areas of dentin and enamel. Differential wearing causes sharp ridges of enamel to be formed on the surface of the tooth (typically a molar), and to remain during the working life of the tooth. Herbivores grind their molars together as they chew (masticate), and the ridges help to shred tough plant material. A material similar to dentin forms the hard material that makes up dermal denticles in sharks and other cartilaginous fish.

He became director of the Acad√©mie Royale. He was given the title of Garde des tableaux et dessins du roi (Keeper of the paintings and drawings of the king), a function which combined the role of director and curator of the king's art collection. Esther Bell, A Curator at the Louvre: Charles Coypel and the Royal Collections at Journal18, Issue 2 Louvre Local (Fall 2016) He was raised to the nobility by the French king. He is known for his history paintings, biblical, mythological and allegorical works, portraits and genre scenes. Life Antoine Coypel was born in Paris as the son of the French painter No√´l Coypel. He studied under his father, with whom he spent four years in Rome after his father had been appointed director of the French academy in 1672. In Rome he sketched the Antique monuments and artworks and studied the works of the Italian Renaissance and Baroque, in particular of Raphael, Carracci, Titian, Veronese and Correggio. He became acquainted with the contemporary artists Gianlorenzo Bernini and Carlo Maratta.Antoine Coypel, La Col√®re d'Achille at the Bernini became his mentor. He won a prize for drawing at the Accademia di San Luca, the association of artists in Rome.Antoine Coypel Biography Stephen Ongpin Fine Art Man resting in the lap of a woman Coypel completed his training at the Acad√©mie Royale in Paris. In 1689 he received an important commission for an altarpiece in the Notre-Dame de Paris. In 1681, at the age of 20 he was admitted (re√ßu) as a full member of the Acad√©mie royale with the submission of a work called Louis XIV repose dans le sein de la Gloire apr√®s la paix de Nim√®gue (Louis XIV rests in the bosom of Glory after the Peace of Nijmegen) (Mus√©e Fabre). He worked on many of the French king's construction projects of that time including in Versailles, Trianon, Marly and Meudon. He was in 1685 appointed premier peintre of the Duke of Orl√©ans (the French king's eldest brother who at the time was Philippe I, Duke of Orl√©ans). The House of Orl√©ans remained an important patron of the artist for many years. Between 1701 and 1706, he created one of his most brilliant works for the d'Orl√©ans family, the vault of the Aeneas Gallery in the Palais-Royal (now disappeared). The work was completed a few years later by a cycle of seven additional paintings. Mount Olympus In 1716 he was appointed king's painter. He was raised to the nobility the following year. He completed an extensive decoration of the ceiling of the Royal chapel at Versailles in 1708, in the manner of the Roman Baroque. His half-brother No√´l-Nicolas and his son Charles-Antoine Coypel (1694‚Äì1752) were also accomplished painters. The sculptor Fran√ßois Dumont was his brother-in-law. Coypel died in 1722, at 61 years of age. Paintings Antoine Coypel's style was eclectic. He worked initially in the French classical tradition which he renewed with a colourful palette. He went through a period in which he was strongly influenced by Rubens as is clear in certain paintings, in particular his Democritus (1692, Louvre). Coypel's spirit of renewal is evident in the series of large paintings on Old Testament themes, which were very well received at the time: Susan accused of adultery (c. 1695, Museo del Prado) and The sacrifice of Jephta's daughter (c. 1695-1697 Mus√©e Magnin). He was, with Jean Jouvenet, Charles de La Fosse and Louis de Boullogne, one of the best examples of the transition in French painting from the austere manner of the reign of Louis XIV to the lighter style of the 18th century. Drawings Coypel was one of the leading draughtsmen of his generation. About 500 of his drawings survive, many of them kept at the Louvre. They comprise figure studies and preparatory drawings for his paintings. He was particularly skilled in the use of coloured pencils and chalks.

The magazine is published monthly by White River Productions, which acquired the title from Carstens Publications in 2014. Its first issue in March 1933 was called The Model Craftsman because it covered other areas of scale modeling as well. Founded by Emanuele Stieri, it was second editor Charles A. Penn who helped grow the company and lead the publication towards the hobby of scale models. In April 1949 it changed its focus to model trains and changed its name to Railroad Model Craftsman to reflect this change in editorial content. While it can claim to be the oldest model railroading magazine in continuous publication in the United States, rival Model Railroader counters with the tagline \\"Model railroading exclusively since 1934.\\" (However, both were predated by The Model Maker, which dates from 1924, and showcased working models of steam engines, trains, and boats.) Over the years, several other titles have been folded into the publication, including Toy Trains, Electric Trains and Hobby Railroading, Miniature Rail Roading, Model & Railway News, and The O Gager.  Early years and development  The company was founded in 1933 by Emanuele Stieri, a prolific how-to writer, and was the first editor-in-chief of the fledgling publication. Published by Model Craftsman Publishing Corp., the company moved headquarters from Chicago to New York City in 1934. The company was acquired by Charles A. Penn in 1935. The company relocated to suburban Ramsey, New Jersey in 1940. During the 1940s, the staff consisted of Charles Penn as editor and publisher, Robert W. Thompson as managing editor, Lewis Austin as the model railroad editor, Leon Shulman as the model airplane editor, and Louis H. Hertz as the research editor. After World War II, Robert Thompson was succeeded by his brother Jim as managing editor. As the magazine's editorial focus shifted entirely toward the hobby of model railroading, the publication was renamed \\"Model Railroad Craftsman\\" in April 1949. Feeling the name was too close to that of Model Railroader, publisher Al Kalmbach asked for a slight name change as professional courtesy. As a result, \\"Railroad Model Craftsman\\" debuted in July 1949. Harold Carstens joined the staff as an associate editor in 1952, after previously contributing several articles. As of 1954, the magazine staff consisted of Charles Penn as editor and publisher, Jim Thompson as executive editor, Hal Carstens as managing editor, Sam Skean, Bill Schopp as technical editor, and Edwin P. Alexander as research editor.  The Carstens era  In 1962, Hal Carstens was named publisher and president following the retirement of Charles Penn. Hal Carstens later purchased the company, and the name was changed to Carstens Publications in 1969. Tony Koester joined the staff as an associate editor in 1968, and later became managing editor in 1971. By 1972, Jim Boyd was working full-time as editor of Flying Models, but was also listed as an associate editor of RMC. The last big move came in 1973 when the publishing company moved to rural Newton in northern New Jersey, housed in a newly constructed suite of offices with an attached warehouse. Koester and Boyd worked together to push more modern prototype content and fine scale modeling features in contrast to the more loose interpretations of the hobby previously published by Hal Carstens. Boyd would be named editor of the new Railfan & Railroad magazine launched by Carstens in 1974. By 1980, Jim Boyd and Bill Schaumburg were listed as associate editors (Bill joined the staff in November 1976). In 1981, Bill Schaumburg succeeded Koester as managing editor, and Chris D'Amato and Jim Ankrom joined the staff as associate editors in 1982. By the mid-1980s, Boyd was dropped from the masthead as he was now concentrating full-time as editor of Railfan & Railroad. The magazine was published 12 times a year by Carstens Publications, located in Newton, New Jersey. As its name would suggest, Railroad Model Craftsman concentrates more on scratch building and kitbashing than its closest competitor. In-depth features relating to prototype historical research, model construction techniques, and high-quality detailing and finishing are common themes. The editors have also closely followed the emerging trend of Railway Prototype Modelers, who seek to reproduce scale replicas of actual existing pieces of railway equipment as closely as possible, and share those techniques with other modelers. Although the magazine is not scale-specific, most of its plans are published either in HO scale or O scale, with instructions on converting them to other scales. Almost all of the content in the magazine is generated by readers, with very few articles produced by the editors. Publisher Hal Carstens died on June 23, 2009, with his son Henry Carstens assuming day-to-day control of the company. Enjoying a long career as RMC's longest serving editor, Bill Schaumburg retired in February 2013. After his departure, the staff of the magazine consisted of editor Chris D'Amato, associate editor Jim Ankrom, and part-time associate editor Scott Lupia. Most of the accompanying art work, maps, and track plans were produced by illustrators Ken Lawrence and Otto Vondrak. White River Productions era After years of financial struggle, Carstens Publications president Henry Carstens announced the company's permanent closure on August 22, 2014. On September 1, 2014, White River Productions of Bucklin, Missouri, announced their acquisition of Railroad Model Craftsman as well as sister publication Railfan & Railroad. Beginning with the January 2015 issue, the primary editorial staff consisted of Stephen Priest and Tony Cook, the first major change since the 1980s. Harry K. Wong later joined the staff as an associate editor. The magazine was completely redesigned, and some columns were retired, while others have been renamed (\\"Safety Valve\\" became \\"Postmarks\\" in 2014, restored to its original name in 2019). The magazine continued to produce in-depth features focused on scale model construction and prototype research. In February 2019, Otto Vondrak was named the eighth editor of Railroad Model Craftsman, effective with the May 2019 issue, and splitting his duties as associate editor of Railfan and Railroad Magazine. The rest of the staff consists of Harry K. Wong as associate editor, and Todd Gillette as graphic designer. In April 2020, Justin Franz joined the staff as Associate Editor.  Magazine sections  The main part of the magazine is dedicated to the features. The subjects can range from a tour of a model railroad; to historical research related to a structure, piece of equipment, or entire railroad line; to the construction, painting, and detailing of a scale model. Safety Vallve - (Formerly \\"Postmarks\\" from 2014-2019) A column of letters submitted to the editors by the readers of RMC expressing opinions about or sharing news related to features published in the magazine.

This means that its function field is isomorphic to :K(U_1, \\\\dots , U_d), the field of all rational functions for some set \\\\\\\\{U_1, \\\\dots, U_d\\\\\\\\} of indeterminates, where d is the dimension of the variety. Rationality and parameterization Let V be an affine algebraic variety of dimension d defined by a prime ideal I = ‚ü®f1, ..., fk‚ü© in K[X_1, \\\\dots , X_n]. If V is rational, then there are n + 1 polynomials g0, ..., gn in K(U_1, \\\\dots , U_d) such that f_i(g_1/g_0, \\\\ldots, g_n/g_0)=0. In order words, we have a rational parameterization x_i=\\\\frac{g_i}{g_0}(u_1,\\\\ldots,u_d) of the variety. Conversely, such a rational parameterization induces a field homomorphism of the field of functions of V into K(U_1, \\\\dots , U_d). But this homomorphism is not necessarily onto. If such a parameterization exists, the variety is said unirational. L√ºroth's theorem (see below) implies that unirational curves are rational. Castelnuovo's theorem implies also that, in characteristic zero, every unirational surface is rational. Rationality questions A rationality question asks whether a given field extension is rational, in the sense of being (up to isomorphism) the function field of a rational variety; such field extensions are also described as purely transcendental. More precisely, the rationality question for the field extension K \\\\subset L is this: is L isomorphic to a rational function field over K in the number of indeterminates given by the transcendence degree? There are several different variations of this question, arising from the way in which the fields K and L are constructed. For example, let K be a field, and let :\\\\\\\\{y_1, \\\\dots, y_n \\\\\\\\} be indeterminates over K and let L be the field generated over K by them. Consider a finite group G permuting those indeterminates over K. By standard Galois theory, the set of fixed points of this group action is a subfield of L, typically denoted L^G. The rationality question for K \\\\subset L^G is called Noether's problem and asks if this field of fixed points is or is not a purely transcendental extension of K. In the paper on Galois theory she studied the problem of parameterizing the equations with given Galois group, which she reduced to \\"Noether's problem\\". (She first mentioned this problem in where she attributed the problem to E. Fischer.) She showed this was true for n = 2, 3, or 4. found a counter-example to the Noether's problem, with n = 47 and G a cyclic group of order 47. L√ºroth's theorem A celebrated case is L√ºroth's problem, which Jacob L√ºroth solved in the nineteenth century. L√ºroth's problem concerns subextensions L of K(X), the rational functions in the single indeterminate X. Any such field is either equal to K or is also rational, i.e. L = K(F) for some rational function F. In geometrical terms this states that a non-constant rational map from the projective line to a curve C can only occur when C also has genus 0. That fact can be read off geometrically from the Riemann‚ÄìHurwitz formula. Even though L√ºroth's theorem is often thought as a non elementary result, several elementary short proofs have been discovered for long. These simple proofs use only the basics of field theory and Gauss's lemma for primitive polynomials (see e.g.). Unirationality A unirational variety V over a field K is one dominated by a rational variety, so that its function field K(V) lies in a pure transcendental field of finite type (which can be chosen to be of finite degree over K(V) if K is infinite). The solution of L√ºroth's problem shows that for algebraic curves, rational and unirational are the same, and Castelnuovo's theorem implies that for complex surfaces unirational implies rational, because both are characterized by the vanishing of both the arithmetic genus and the second plurigenus. Zariski found some examples (Zariski surfaces) in characteristic p > 0 that are unirational but not rational. showed that a cubic three-fold is in general not a rational variety, providing an example for three dimensions that unirationality does not imply rationality. Their work used an intermediate Jacobian. showed that all non-singular quartic threefolds are irrational, though some of them are unirational. found some unirational 3-folds with non-trivial torsion in their third cohomology group, which implies that they are not rational. For any field K, J√°nos Koll√°r proved in 2000 that a smooth cubic hypersurface of dimension at least 2 is unirational if it has a point defined over K. This is an improvement of many classical results, beginning with the case of cubic surfaces (which are rational varieties over an algebraic closure). Other examples of varieties that are shown to be unirational are many cases of the moduli space of curves. Rationally connected variety  A rationally connected variety (or uniruled variety) V is a projective algebraic variety over an algebraically closed field such that through every two points there passes the image of a regular map from the projective line into V. Equivalently, a variety is rationally connected if every two points are connected by a rational curve contained in the variety.. This definition differs form that of path connectedness only by the nature of the path, but is very different, as the only algebraic curves which are rationally connected are the rational ones. Every rational variety, including the projective spaces, is rationally connected, but the converse is false. The class of the rationally connected varieties is thus a generalization of the class of the rational varieties. Unirational varieties are rationally connected, but it is not known if the converse holds. Stably rational varieties A variety V is called stably rational if V \\\\times \\\\mathbf P^m is rational for some m \\\\ge 0. Any rational variety is thus, by definition, stably rational. Examples constructed by show, that the converse is false however. showed that very general hypersurfaces V \\\\subset \\\\mathbf P^{N+1} are not stably rational, provided that the degree of V is at least \\\\log_2 N+2.

Mamers Valles rille on Mars. Rima Ariadaeus is categorized as a straight rille (graben) and is over 300 km in length. Hadley Rille at center is a sinuous rille visited by the Apollo 15 mission. Detail of part of Hadley Rille Rille (German for 'groove') is typically used to describe any of the long, narrow depressions in the surface of the Moon that resemble channels. The Latin term is rima, plural rimae. Typically a rille can be up to several kilometers wide and hundreds of kilometers in length. However, the term has also been used loosely to describe similar structures on a number of planets in the Solar System, including Mars, Venus, and on a number of moons. All bear a structural resemblance to each other. Structures Three types of rille are found on the lunar surface: * Sinuous rilles meander in a curved path like a mature river, and are commonly thought to be the remains of collapsed lava tubes or extinct lava flows. They usually begin at an extinct volcano, then meander and sometimes split as they are followed across the surface. Vallis Schr√∂teri in Oceanus Procellarum is the largest sinuous rille, and Rima Hadley is the only one visited by humans, on the Apollo 15 mission. Another prominent example is Rima Herigonius. * Arcuate rilles have a smooth curve and are found on the edges of the dark lunar maria. They are believed to have formed when the lava flows that created a mare cooled, contracted and sank. These are found all over the moon, examples can be seen near the south-western border of Mare Tranquillitatis and on the south-eastern border of Mare Humorum. Rima Sulpicius Gallus is a clear example in southwestern Mare Serenitatis. * Straight rilles follow long, linear paths and are believed to be grabens, sections of the crust that have sunk between two parallel faults. These can be readily identified when they pass through craters or mountain ranges. Vallis Alpes is by far the largest graben rille, indeed it is regarded as too large to be called a rille and is itself bisected by a linear rille; Rima Ariadaeus, west of Mare Tranquillitatis, is a clearer example. Rilles which show more than one structure are termed hybrid rilles. Rima Hyginus in Sinus Medii is an example, initially formed through a fault and subsequently subject to volcanic activity. Formation Precise formation mechanisms of rilles have yet to be determined. It is likely that the different types are formed by different processes. Common features shared by lunar rilles and similar structures on other bodies suggest that common causative mechanisms operate widely in the solar system. Leading theories include lava channels, collapsed lava tubes, near-surface dike intrusion, nu√©e ardente (pyroclastic cloud), subsidence of lava-covered basin and crater floors, and tectonic extension. On-site examination would be necessary to clarify exact methods. =Sinuous rilles= According to NASA, the origin of lunar sinuous rilles remains controversial. The Hadley Rille is a 1.5 km wide and over 300 m deep sinuous rille. It is thought to be a giant conduit that carried lava from an eruptive vent far to the south. Topographic information obtained from the Apollo 15 photographs supports this possibility; however, many puzzles about the rille remain.

While there, he drew and painted in his spare time, befriended Johann Baptist Hofner (1832-1913), the animal painter, and decided to become an artist. In 1854, he obtained his family's reluctant permission to study at the Academy of Fine Arts, Munich, and later took private lessons from Hermann Ansch√ºtz. Portrait of Adolf von Schack (1875) Lenbach was already an accomplished artist when he became the pupil of Karl von Piloty. In 1858, he was able to stage an exhibition at the Glaspalast and won a travel scholarship, which enabled him to accompany Piloty to Rome. A few works remain as the outcome of this first journey: A Peasant seeking Shelter from Bad Weather (1855), The Goatherd (1860, in the Schack Gallery, Munich) and The Arch of Titus (in the Palfy collection, Budapest). He also travelled to Paris and Brussels. It was about then that he started receiving his first portrait commissions. On returning to Munich, he was at once called to Weimar to take the appointment of professor at the newly established Weimar Saxon Grand Ducal Art School, where he became known for taking his students on painting expeditions en plein aire. He remained for only two years, however, when he felt the need for more studies and decided to take another trip to Italy. During this time, he also found an important patron; Baron Adolf Friedrich von Schack. Through his support, Lenbach was able to leave for Italy in 1863 with a guaranteed annual income. Portrait of Pope Leo XIII (c. 1885) He returned to Munich in 1866. The following year, he won a gold medal at the Exposition Universelle and went to Spain for one year, accompanied by his student, Ernst Friedrich von Liphart,Baron Ernst Friedrich von Liphart, RusArtNet.com, retrieved 31 December 2013 to make more copies of the Old Masters for Schack.Ernst Friederich von Liphart, Master Paintings, retrieved 3 January 2014 Upon returning, his career as a portrait painter began in earnest. His breakthrough came in 1869, when he won a gold medal at the Glaspalast, despite being up against many fashionable French painters. After 1870, he began making visits to Vienna to develop a market for his paintings there, which even survived the Panic of 1873. It is also said that he travelled there frequently because he had a passion for Maria Beccadelli di Bologna, which was never returned. From 1875 to 1876 he, Hans Makart, and other associates made a trip to Egypt, which left a deep impression in his style. In 1882, he was awarded the Order of Merit of the Bavarian Crown, which entitled him to become \\"Von Lenbach\\". The following year, he was back in Rome, where he lived in apartments at the Palazzo Borghese. In 1885, he was commissioned to do a portrait of Pope Leo XIII. As the Pope did not have time to sit for the portrait, a new technique was used to create a photographic template. He left Rome in 1887 and began building a villa in Munich. Later that year, he married Countess Magdalena Moltke. Portrait of his second wife, Charlotte (1897) By the 1890s, he was painting almost entirely from photographs, a common practice at the time, but he also began working too fast, in an effort to create sufficient income. In 1895, a major scandal erupted when one of his assistants took unfinished paintings and sketches, had students fill in the details, and passed them off as Lenbach's work. In 1896, he and Magdalena were divorced, over suspicions of infidelity with her doctor, Ernst Schweninger whom she did in fact later marry. Lenbach also remarried, to Charlotte von Hornstein, daughter of the composer Robert von Hornstein. He refused to join the Munich Secession and was highly critical of the new Bavarian National Museum. He also began to paint women, almost exclusively, whereas before he had concentrated on men. Around 1900, he started to produce trading card designs for the Stollwerck chocolate company of Cologne. In 1902, he became an honorary Knight in the Legion of Honour. That same year, he suffered a stroke while returning from a trip to his home town and never fully recovered. He died at his Munich villa two years later. He was buried at the Westfriedhof and many prominent figures spoke at his funeral. Legacy Most of Lenbach's paintings are now in national collections in the United Kingdom, with others in the Frye Art Museum in Seattle, Washington.Charles and Emma Frye Collection, Frye Museum, retrieved 5 February 2014 The British collections include portraits by Lenbach of Bismarck and Gladstone in the National Galleries of Scotland and another of Gladstone in the Palace of Westminster.

(Roud 14, Child 243) is a popular Scottish ballad.Lloyd, A.L. The Demon Lover, Mainly Norfolk Synopsis A man (usually the Devil) returns to his former lover after a very long absence, and finds her with a husband (usually a carpenter) and a baby. He entices her to leave both behind and come with him, luring her with many ships laden with treasure. They board one of his ships (which in many versions she is surprised to find does not have a crew) and put to sea.Lyle, Emily (ed.), Scottish Ballads Canongate: Edinburgh (1994) She soon begins to lament leaving her child, but is heartened by spying a bright hill in the distance. Her lover informs her that the hill is heaven, where they are not bound. Instead he indicates a much darker coast, which he tells her is hell, their destination. He then breaks the ship in half with his bare hands and feet, drowning them both. In other versions, the ship is wrecked by a storm at sea, springing a leak, causing the ship to spin three times and then sink into the cold sea.Carruthers, Gerard. The Devil in Scotland The Bottle Imp, Issue 3 This ballad was one of 25 traditional works included in Ballads Weird and Wonderful (1912), edited by R. Pearse Chope and illustrated by Vernon Hill. The New York Times review of Hill's illustrations noted those accompanying this ballad as a particular highlight: Variants and derivatives Many American versions use the title \\"The House Carpenter\\". Elizabeth Bowen's 1945 short story \\"The Demon Lover\\" uses the ballad's central conceit for a narrative of ghostly return in wartime London.

During the Headlines show about 9/11, ESPN aired the entrance of Dallas Cowboys defensive back George Teague entering Texas Stadium with the American flag when the NFL resumed play after the attacks; otherwise, it had to air still photographs whenever the league was mentioned. Neither the league nor ESPN explained why the footage was absent, but the network had just shown Playmakers, a weekly drama show about a fictitious professional football team called the Cougars. The show's blunt treatment of off-the-field problems drew criticism from NFL officials, and reports surfaced that the NFL threatened not to renew ESPN's television contract with the league if Playmakers was renewed for a second season. The show was not renewed.

Life and work Von Piloty was born in Munich. His father, Ferdinand Piloty (d. 1844), enjoyed a great reputation as a lithographer. In 1840, Karl was admitted as a student of the Munich Academy, under the artists Karl Schorn and Julius Schnorr von Karolsfeld. A year later the acclaimed history paintings (referred to as the 'Belgian paintings'), i.e. the Compromise of the nobles and The Abdication of Charles V by the two Belgian artists Edouard de Bi√®fve and Louis Gallait, were shown in Munich and their realistic depiction of a historic subject matter made a lasting impression on him.John R. Hinde, Jacob Burckhardt and the Crisis of Modernity, McGill-Queen's Press - MQUP, 28 Jun, 2000, p. 249Realistische Malerei und das Ereignis der belgischen Bilder After a journey to Belgium, France and England, he commenced work as a painter of genre pictures, and in 1853 produced a work, Die Amme (The Wet Nurse), which, on account of its originality of style, caused a considerable sensation in Germany at the time. But he soon forsook this branch of painting in favour of historical subjects, and produced in 1854 for King Maximilian II The Accession of Maximilian I to the Catholic League in 1609. It was succeeded by Seni at the Dead Body of Wallenstein (1855), which gained for the young painter the membership of the Munich Academy, where he succeeded Schorn (his brother-in-law) as professor in 1856. Among other well-known works by Piloty are the Battle of the White Mountain near Prague, Nero Dancing upon the Ruins of Rome (1861), Godfrey of Bouillon on a Pilgrimage to the Holy Land (1861), Galileo in Prison (1864) and The Death of Alexander the Great (unfinished), his last great work. He also executed a number of mural paintings for the royal palace in Munich. For Baron von Schach, he painted the famous Discovery of America. In 1874, he was appointed keeper of the Munich Academy, being afterwards ennobled by the king of Bavaria. Piloty was the foremost representative of the realistic school in Germany. He was a successful teacher, and among his more famous pupils were Hans Makart, Franz von Lenbach, Franz Defregger, Gabriel von Max, Georgios Jakobides, and Eduard von Gr√ºtzner.

George Bramwell Evens (1884‚Äì20 November 1943) was, under the pseudonym Romany (and sometimes The Tramp), a British radio broadcaster and writer on countryside and natural history matters ‚Äì quite possibly the first to broadcast on such issues. He was also a Minister of the Methodist Church. Biography Evens' photograph of Raq, from the frontispiece of Out With Romany Again Evens' mother was Romani, born in a vardo (gypsy wagon). His father was Salvation Army Lieutenant George Evens, a native of Plymouth. He was born at 3 Argyll Street, Anlaby Road, Hull, England and educated at Epworth College, Rhyl, as boarder, then at Queens College, Taunton. He married Eunice, the daughter of The Reverend Owen Thomas on 1 August 1911. He is most famous for his Out with the Romany radio programmes (later Out with Romany), which commenced in 1933 on the BBC's Children's Hour, describing travels in his own vardo (purchased in 1921, at Brough Hill Fair, for ¬£75), with Comma the horse, his English Cocker Spaniel, Raq, and his young friends Muriel and Doris. Although the programmes were all pre-scripted and performed entirely in the studio, the impression given was of Romany and his friends going for a walk in the countryside and spontaneously discussing the plants and animals they came across. Raphael Samuel saw the programme as instrumental in making the countryside desirable for a generation of listeners.R Samuel, Theatres of Memory Vol I (London 1994) p. 235 Simon Barnes has paid tribute to how his father (radio) and himself (books) were drawn to natural history by Romany: \\"I longed to walk through the country with the all-knowing, all-seeing Romany\\".S Barnes, How to be a Bad Birdwatcher (London 2004) p. 45 Plaque in Carlisle As a Methodist minister, Evens' ministries included Goole; the Methodist Central Hall, Carlisle (1914‚Äì26); Huddersfield (1926‚Äì29); and the King Cross Methodist Chapel, Halifax (1929‚Äì39), after which ill health forced him to give up the ministry. He retired to Wilmslow, where he died, leaving his wife, son Glyn and daughter, Romany June. His ashes were scattered, at his request, at Old Parks Farm, Glassonby, Cumbria, which he had enjoyed visiting over a 22-year period: in 2001, a memorial to him was erected to him there by The Romany Society.Plaque at Old Parks Farm, see image on Flickr The vardo in Wilmslow in 2006 The vardo was donated, unconditionally, by his widow, to the forerunners of Cheshire East Borough Council (CEBC).

As a young man he associated with the painters of the Nazarene movement who revived the florid Renaissance style in religious art. He is remembered for his extensive Picture Bible, and his designs for stained glass windows in cathedrals. Biography Flight into Egypt Schnorr was born in Leipzig, the son of Veit Hanns Schnorr von CarolsfeldArtist biography in German Masters of the Nineteenth Century, pp.272‚Äì3 (1764‚Äì1841), a draughtsman, engraver and painter, from whom he received his initial artistic education, his earliest known works being copies of the Neoclassical drawings of John Flaxman. In 1811 he entered the Vienna Academy, from which Johann Friedrich Overbeck and others who rebelled against the old conventional style had been expelled about a year before. There he studied under Friedrich Heinrich F√ºger, and became friends with Joseph Anton Koch and Heinrich Olivier, both of whom would have an important influence on his style. Schnorr followed Overbeck and the other founders of the Nazarene movement to Rome in 1815. This school of religious and romantic art tended to reject modern styles, attempting to revert to and revive the principles and practice of earlier periods. At the beginning of his time in Rome, Schnorr was particularly influenced by his close study of fifteenth-century Italian painting, especially the works of Fra Angelico. Soon however, he abandoned this refined simplicity, and began to look towards more elaborate High Renaissance models. From its outset the Nazarene movement made an effort to recover fresco painting and monumental art, and Schnorr had an opportunity to demonstrate his powers when commissioned to decorate the entrance hall of the Villa Massimo near the Lateran with frescoes illustrating the works of Ariosto.Encyclop√¶dia Britannica, 1911 Other cycles in the house were begun by Peter von Cornelius and Johann Friedrich Overbeck.Schiff, Gert, \\"An Epoch of longing\\" in German Masters of the Nineteenth Century, p.18 Schnorr married Maria Heller, the stepdaughter of Ferdinand Olivier, in 1827. Their son Ludwig Schnorr von Carolsfeld was an operatic tenor who died at the age of 29. He had just begun to gain renown as the first to sing Wagner's Tristan. Schnorr's brother, (1788‚Äì1853) was also a painter. Schnorr died in Munich in 1872. Career Ruth in Boaz's Field , 1828 The second period of Schnorr's artistic output began in 1825, when he left Rome, settled in Munich, entered the service of Ludwig I of Bavaria, and transplanted to Germany the art of wall-painting which he had learned in Italy. He showed himself qualified as a sort of poet-painter to the Bavarian court; he organized a staff of trained executants, and covered five halls in the new palace ‚Äì the \\"Residenz\\" ‚Äì with frescoes illustrating the Nibelungenlied. He also painted a series of scenes from the lives of Charlemagne, Frederick Barbarossa and Rudolph of Habsburg. Schnorr had initially wanted to create a complex symbolic programme in which these German historical subjects were combined with scenes from the Old Testament. This however was rejected by Ludwig, leaving Schnorr to complain that he was left with the task of painting a mere \\"newspaper report of the Middle Ages\\" (\\"Zeitungsartikel des Mittelalters\\"). Critics considered these compositions to be creative, learned in composition, masterly in drawing, but also exaggerated in thought and extravagant in style.See also The Burlington Magazine, vol. 101, No. 676/677 (July/August 1959) \\"The Romantic Exhibition\\" by Kenneth Garlick In 1846 Schnorr moved to Dresden to become a professor at the academy there. The next year he was appointed director of the Gem√§ldegalerie.Artist biography in German Masters of the Nineteenth Century, p.273 Art Schnorr von Carolsfeld Picture Bible Schnorr's third period was marked by his Biblical illustrations. He was a Lutheran, and took a broad and un-sectarian view. His Picture Bible was published in Leipzig in 30 parts in 1852‚Äì60, and an English edition followed in 1861. The Picture Bible illustrations were often complex and cluttered; some critics found them lacking in harmony of line and symmetry, judging them to be inferior to equivalent work produced by Raphael. His style differs from the simplicity and severity of earlier times, exhibiting instead the floridity of the later Renaissance. Schnorr's biblical drawings and cartoons for frescoes formed a natural prelude to designs for church windows, and his renown in Germany secured commissions in Great Britain. Schnorr was one of ten artists who provided designs for a scheme of stained-glass for Glasgow Cathedral, commissioned in 1856‚Äì7 and manufactured at the royal factory in Munich, and he later designed windows for St Paul's Cathedral in London. This Munich glass provoked controversy: medievalists objected to its lack of lustre, and stigmatized the windows as mere coloured blinds and picture transparencies. The opposing party, however, claimed for these modern revivals \\"the union of the severe and excellent drawing of early Florentine oil- paintings with the colouring and arrangement of the glass-paintings of the latter half of the 16th century.\\" Four windows by Schnorr were installed at St Paul's: three in the chancel (removed in 1888) and one at the west end (destroyed in 1941). Most of the Munich glass at Glasgow was removed during the 20th century.

A Democrat, he was the 44th mayor of Baltimore from December 1971 to January 1987, the 58th Governor of Maryland from January 21, 1987 to January 18, 1995, and the 32nd Comptroller of Maryland from January 20, 1999 to January 17, 2007. On September 12, 2006, Schaefer was defeated in his reelection bid for a third term as Comptroller by Maryland Delegate Peter Franchot in the Democratic Party primary. Early life and career Schaefer was born in the City of Baltimore, Maryland, the son of Tululu Irene (n√©e Skipper) and William Henry Schaefer, on November 2, 1921.Tululu Irene Skipper. Records.ancestry.com (November 10, 1983). Retrieved April 12, 2014. His parents were Baptist, and he was of part German ancestry.C. Fraser Smith (1999). Donald Schaefer: A Political Biography Johns Hopkins University Press. p. 7. . He spent his childhood at 620 Edgewood Street in the old West Baltimore community off Edmondson Avenue, near Hilton Street and Parkway by Gwynns Falls-Leakin Park. He received early education in Baltimore's city public schools, and later graduated from The Baltimore City College (a public high school) in its centennial class of 1939. Schaefer received an LL.B. from the University of Baltimore School of Law in 1942 and an LL.M. in 1954. Schaefer was a member of the Order of DeMolay in Baltimore as a youth, later inducted into the DeMolay International Hall of Fame. He was also a Freemason and a member of the \\"Grand Lodge of Ancient Free and Accepted Masons of the State of Maryland\\". He was a member of \\"Mystic Circle Lodge No. 104\\" when he first ran for public office. When the United States entered World War II on Monday, December 8, 1941, Schaefer joined the United States Army and later achieved officer rank, taking charge of administering hospitals in England and the rest of western Europe. He continued to remain in the U.S. Army Reserves during his academic, legal and political/public service careers until 1979, when he retired with the rank of colonel. Schaefer resumed his legal career afterwards, practicing real estate law. He had earned his Master of Law degree in 1954 from the University of Baltimore School of Law and formed a general practice law firm with two colleagues. Except for his military service, he lived unmarried with his mother in two different very plain West Baltimore two-story, six-room \\"daylight-style\\" rowhouses on Edgewood Street (off Edmondson Avenue) all his life, until moving to the Government House (Maryland Governor's Mansion) at age 65 in 1987. Schaefer ran for a seat in the Maryland House of Delegates (lower chamber of the General Assembly of Maryland) in 1950 and again in 1954, losing both elections. He was successful in his third campaign for a seat on the Baltimore City Council in 1955, when his concern for city planning and housing issues propelled him to a seat representing the 5th Councilmanic District. In 1967, Schaefer ran successfully for Baltimore City Council president and, four years later in 1971, he ran successfully for the mayor's office, when incumbent mayor Thomas L. J. D'Alesandro III, brother of Nancy Pelosi, retired after one term. Mayor of Baltimore (1971‚Äì1987) Schaefer served four terms as mayor, being first elected in 1971, then re- elected in 1975, 1979 and 1983, each time receiving 85% or more of the vote. He was known for his attention to detail: taking notes of strewn garbage and citing other violations as he rode around for appointments/events in a plain town car with a police officer driver, and ordering them fixed immediately. A famous photograph shows him dressed in a Victorian style red and orange- striped bathing suit, with a straw boater hat, carrying an inflatable rubber duck into the outside seal pool at the then under construction National Aquarium in Baltimore at the Inner Harbor, attracting wide national media attention, to settle a wager that it would not be opened in time in August 1981. In 1984, in a move to give the majority African-American population more power in the city of Baltimore, Schaefer named Bishop L. Robinson as the Baltimore City Police Department's first African-American police commissioner, a position previously dominated by Irish American and Italian American members of the city police department. Baltimore's 1967 police headquarters were renamed for Robinson in 2007. Throughout his tenure as mayor, Schaefer realized that the closings of large manufacturing plants like Bethlehem Steel at Sparrows Point (since 1887 in southeastern suburban, but blue-collar Baltimore County, near Dundalk), the largest waterfront steel mill in the world; and the 70-year-old General Motors auto/truck assembly plant on Broening Highway in the southeast city would negatively impact the quality of life in the city of Baltimore and add to the city's unemployment rate. His administration turned to tourism as a possible alternative. He pushed for and saw built a new Baltimore Convention Center along West Pratt Street between South Charles, Sharp and Howard Streets in downtown Baltimore in 1979, enlarged again in the 1990s to keep up with expanding and larger competition for the burgeoning nationwide convention business; as well as the opening of Baltimore's famed \\"Harborplace\\", festival marketplace pavilions by shopping center developer and urban visionary James Rouse along the north and west shores of the old \\"Basin\\" (Inner Harbor) at East Pratt Street along South Calvert Street, replacing the former small grassy central \\"Pratt and Light\\" triangular Samuel Smith Park with its bronze statue of the old brave \\"Defender of Baltimore\\" (from the British attack at the Battle of Baltimore crafted at the 1914 Star Spangled Banner Centennial from the War of 1812) and its surrounding \\"temporary\\" Light Street parking lots from the last waterfront \\"urban renewal\\" project of the Mayor Thomas J. D'Alesandro, Jr. (1903‚Äì1987, served 1947‚Äì1959) administration from the late 1940s. Dubbed \\"America's Best Mayor\\" at the time by several national magazine stories, Mayor Schaefer was hailed for transforming a deteriorating city into a hub of national tourism, although the groundwork and the original vision for the Inner Harbor project in the early 1960s to succeed the previous Charles Center downtown renewal of 1958‚Äì1970 had first been foreseen and crafted two mayoral administrations earlier under progressive/liberal Republican mayor and former governor of Maryland Theodore R. McKeldin (1900‚Äì1974, served 1943‚Äì1947 and 1963‚Äì1967), who was eventually recognized by having the redeveloped plaza facing the new \\"festival marketplaces\\" at Pratt, Light and Calvert Streets renamed for him. With new businesses, new hotels, a new National Aquarium and the new convention center, Baltimore had been revived. Harborplace had 18 million visitors its first year, 1980‚Äì81. In 1984, Esquire Magazine named Schaefer \\"the best mayor in America\\". =Colts leave= Schaefer constantly battled Robert Irsay, the owner of the Baltimore Colts of the National Football League. Irsay and Orioles owner Jerrold Hoffberger complained that Memorial Stadium, which the Colts and the American League's Baltimore Orioles shared, was antiquated due to a lack of quality seats and inadequate parking. Schaefer extracted a promise from Irsay that the Colts owner would call Schaefer first before moving the team. However, after one of the houses of the Maryland State Legislature passed legislation giving the city of Baltimore the right to seize ownership of the team by eminent domain ‚Äì an idea first floated in a memo written by Baltimore mayoral aide Mark Wasserman ‚Äì Robert Irsay called Indianapolis Mayor William Hudnut that afternoon and began serious negotiations in order to move the team before the Maryland legislature's other chamber could pass similar legislation. In the early morning hours of March 29, 1984, Mayflower moving vans began relocating the Colts from the team's Owings Mills training facility to Indianapolis. Schaefer lamented that \\"[Irsay] didn't call his old friend, Don\\" before the move. =Ravens arrive= The Colts were not the first professional sports team to leave Baltimore on Schaefer's watch. In 1973, the Baltimore Bullets moved to Landover, Maryland and were renamed the Capital Bullets, and later, the Washington Bullets. In his last years as mayor, and later during his two terms as governor, Schaefer led the push to build Oriole Park at Camden Yards for the Orioles and M&T; Bank Stadium for a new NFL team, which came to fruition in 1996 when Art Modell moved the Cleveland Browns to Baltimore, giving credit to Schaefer for the transaction: Governor of Maryland (1987‚Äì1995) Schaefer speaking at commissioning for the United States Navy, 1987 Schaefer at the unveiling of a Monument dedicated to the \\"Maryland 400\\", Prospect Park, August 27, 1991. Schaefer, with running mate Melvin Steinberg, was overwhelmingly elected the 58th governor of Maryland in 1986, defeating Republican challenger Thomas J. Mooney with 82% of the vote, the largest percentage total ever for a contested statewide election in Maryland. He was re-elected in 1990 with almost 60% of the vote. Immediately upon taking office, Schaefer sought to take on the state's unemployment problem. After learning of a proposed closing of a major corporation in western Maryland, he personally went to Allegany County with his top advisors and the Maryland Congressional delegation and devised a plan of state and federal action to meet the needs of the faltering company. The corporation kept its headquarters in Allegany County, saving 600 jobs. Schaefer's legacy includes the construction of Oriole Park at Camden Yards, stricter measures taken toward preventing and solving the Chesapeake Bay pollution problem, and higher standards for public schools. Schaefer reappointed Philip Kapneck as Maryland Trade Ambassador, originally appointed by Governor Mandel. Kapneck worked closely with the pro-business governor, bringing overseas companies to Maryland, creating many new jobs and generating revenue for the state. Schaefer as governor also pushed for the light rail line of electric trains that run 30 miles from Hunt Valley in Baltimore County, through Baltimore, past Oriole Park at Camden Yards, to Cromwell Station/Glen Burnie in Anne Arundel County, near BWI Airport. The first 22.5 miles of the light rail line was opened in April 1992 at a cost of near $400 million. Three extensions totaling 7.5 miles opened in late 1997 at a cost of $106 million. Detractors remind the public that, in the winter of 1991, Gov. Schaefer compared Maryland's Eastern Shore to an outhouse (he referred to the region as a \\"shithouse\\"Baltimore City Paper, \\"Ballot Stuffing\\" , August 19, 1998.). When the remark circulated, Eastern Shore residents erupted in protest. In the 1992 presidential election, Governor Schaefer endorsed Republican President George H.W. Bush over Democratic challenger Bill Clinton. \\"He was a great man. I liked him; he was a friend. I went up to Camp David with him.\\". He also endorsed Republican Congresswoman Helen Delich Bentley in her bid to succeed him as governor in 1994. Schaefer stepped down from his position as governor on January 18, 1995 after serving the maximum two four- year terms. Post-gubernatorial activities Following his career as governor, Schaefer became Of Counsel to the law firm of Gordon, Feinblatt, Rothman, Hoffberger & Hollander, LLC, in Baltimore until 1999. The William Donald Schaefer Chair was established at University of Maryland, College Park's School of Public Affairs in 1995. Schaefer held the position until 1999, at which time the program was expanded to include funded internships. Schaefer had a long-time companion in Hilda Mae Snoops, who was his \\"official hostess\\" in the Governor's mansion. She commissioned a controversial Victorian-style outdoor fountain and helped design a rose garden and walkways. The fountain is included in her First Lady-style portrait. After Snoops' death in 1999, the fountain became a source of controversy as Schaefer accused his successor, Parris Glendening, of using it to get political revenge by turning it off, supposedly to save water even though it recycles existing water. Upon becoming governor, Robert Ehrlich held a ceremony to turn the water flow back on in the fountain. Snoops is interred in the mausoleum at Dulaney Valley Memorial Gardens, with an adjacent place reserved for Schaefer. Comptroller of Maryland (1999‚Äì2007) In 1998, three years after leaving the governorship, with the sudden death of longtime (forty years in office) Comptroller and Maryland political legend Louis L. Goldstein of Calvert County in southern Maryland, Schaefer ran in the special election for the position of Comptroller of Maryland against Republican Mark Epstein. He won by a substantial margin, 62% to 38%. Schaefer came into the office on January 25, 1999. In 2002, he had remained extremely popular in Maryland and received almost 68% of the vote in the general election. Schaefer feuded frequently with Governor Parris Glendening at the bi-monthly Board of Public Works (BPW) meetings. Schaefer once called Glendening a \\"despot\\" and often chided him. Schaefer frequently referred to Glendening as \\"Ayatollah.\\" Glendening endorsed and paid for advertisements on behalf of Schaefer's 2002 Democratic primary opponent, Secretary of State John T. Willis, but Schaefer defeated him easily. Glendening's degree of unpopularity was such that it was reported his support for Willis might cost Willis votes. Alt URL Schaefer enjoyed considerably warmer relations with Governor Robert Ehrlich, the Republican who succeeded Glendening on January 15, 2003. =Controversies= As Comptroller, Schaefer regularly spoke critically of immigrants who cannot communicate in English. He was particularly well known for his May 2004 comment about a non-English- speaking McDonald's cashier. Schaefer also stirred up controversy on October 12, 2004, when he called people with AIDS \\"a danger\\". He said that those with the disease \\"brought it on themselves.\\" From the 1990s, he had repeatedly called for a public registry listing HIV-positive Maryland residents. \\"As far as I'm concerned, people who have AIDS are a danger\\", Schaefer said. \\"People should be able to know who has AIDS.\\"Washington Post, \\"Schaefer Faults AIDS Patients\\", October 13, 2004; Page B01. On February 15, 2006, Schaefer made suggestive comments to Elizabeth Krum, a 24-year-old assistant to then- Governor Robert Ehrlich. Responding to Schaefer's request for tea, Krum set a thermal mug in front of him. Schaefer watched her walk away, then beckoned for her to return. When she obliged, he told her, \\"Walk again\\", staring after her as she left the conference room. Schaefer initially refused to apologize, saying, \\"She's a pretty little girl. She ought to be damn happy that I observed her going out the door. The day I don't look at pretty women is the day I die.\\" (Schaefer long called the women with whom he worked \\"little girls.\\") However, within days of the leering incident, Schaefer issued a handwritten letter to Krum informing her she had handled the affair as a \\"trouper.\\"Washington Post, \\"Schaefer Apologizes to Ehrlich Aide\\", February 18, 2006; Page B01. On July 5, 2006, Schaefer launched into a rambling commentary on immigration as the public works board considered a contract to provide testing services for the English as a Second Language (ESOL) program in Maryland schools. As state education officials tried to explain the contract, Schaefer demanded to know whether the program would benefit Korean students. \\"Korea's another one, all of a sudden they're our friends, too, shooting missiles at us\\", he said. Schaefer was apparently referring to North Korea's test launch earlier that week of a long-range missile, which fell into the ocean. Schaefer refused to apologize for his comments after a meeting with South Korean community leaders.Baltimore Sun, \\"Schaefer's words stir criticism\\", July 6, 2006. Later that same day, when he was questioned by a female Baltimore Sun reporter about the ESOL program, Schaefer's response was to call her a \\"sweet little girl.\\" =2006 re-election campaign= Schaefer faced a competitive primary challenge for Comptroller in 2006. He was challenged by Anne Arundel County Executive Janet S. Owens and Delegate Peter Franchot (District 20). The campaign initially looked like a struggle between Schaefer and Franchot. After deciding against running for the U.S. House seat being vacated by Benjamin Cardin (so that Cardin could run for the U.S. Senate), Owens decided to jump into the race for Comptroller. In early July 2006, when asked if he would debate Owens, he said he \\"wouldn't debate her on how to bake a chocolate cake.\\" Franchot campaigned strongly as the \\"only real Democrat in the race.\\" On September 5, 2006, Schaefer told Washington Post columnist Marc Fisher that Janet Owens is a \\"prissy little miss\\" who wears \\"long dresses, looks like Mother Hubbardit's sort of like she was a man.\\" He made additional comments that she was \\"getting fat.\\" Later, in an on-air interview with reporter Tyler Evans of local news station News Channel 8, he further commented: \\"She's got these long clothes on and an old-fashioned hairdo. You know it sort of makes you real mad.\\"Washington Post, \\"Owens Assails Schaefer's Remarks\\", September 6, 2006; Page B01. On September 8, 2006, another local news station, WUSA9, showed an off-screen reporter asking him, \\"Did you call her an Old Mother Hubbard?\\" to which he responded, \\"Well, what does she look like? ... Old-fashioned hairdo; long dress ... If I lose or win ‚Äì whatever I do ‚Äì I'm gonna send her some Style magazines.\\" His campaign called a press conference, but he failed to show. Owens commented that perhaps Schaefer had become too old to run, saying that running against him was like a granddaughter \\"taking the keys away from grandpa.\\" In response, Schaefer and his campaign hinted that Owens was lashing out at him in an act of age discrimination. One viewer wrote in, suggesting that perhaps Schaefer was showing signs of dementia. The anchor responded that the caller had pointed out \\"the elephant in the room\\" that, until then, the media was hesitant to suggest.WUSA9 News, Washington, D.C., \\"Comptroller Campaign Battle Of Barbs\\" Video , September 8, 2006. Schaefer refused to apologize for his comments regarding Owens' appearance, saying, \\"An apology? An apology for what? I can't help it how she looks.\\" Asked about his heated exchanges with Owens, Schaefer said, \\"This was started not by me.\\" He added, \\"There's dirty politics, and then there's filthy politics.\\"Baltimore Sun, \\"Comptroller Race Takes on a Personal Tone\\", September 7, 2006. On September 12, during the Democratic primary election, Schaefer was pushed into third place behind Franchot and Owens, with Franchot winning the primary by 15,000 votes over Owens. The tight three-way race saw Franchot winning the Washington, D.C., suburbs (Montgomery County and Prince George's County), Owens winning in Central Maryland (Howard County and Anne Arundel County), and Schaefer holding his own in the Baltimore metro area (Baltimore City and Baltimore County).NBC4 News, Washington, D.C., \\"Johnson Earns Democratic Nod For Prince George's Co. Exec.\\", September 12, 2006. This was Schaefer's first campaign loss since 1954. Schaefer's last day at work as Comptroller was January 19, 2007. He was succeeded on January 22 by Franchot, who won the general election, and was not present for Franchot's swearing in.Ovetta Wiggins, \\"Franchot Takes Office, Claims Expanded Role\\", The Washington Post, January 23, 2007, page B02. After retiring, he moved into the Charlestown Retirement Community in Catonsville, Maryland. His health declined quickly and he made few public appearances in his final years. Volunteer service For many years Schaefer served on the Board of Trustees for St. Mary's College of Maryland. He was very active on the board and also played key roles in the establishment of the Center for the Study of Democracy at the college, where he also served on the advisory board. Death The flag-draped casket of William Donald Schaefer being carried into historic Old Saint Paul's Episcopal Church, at North Charles and East Saratoga Streets, April 27, 2011Schaefer died at the age of 89 on April 18, 2011, at his latest home in Catonsville. He had recently been hospitalized due to pneumonia at St. Agnes Hospital in southwest Baltimore and was receiving hospice care at the time of his death. Schaefer's funeral was held at his longtime parish, Old St. Paul's Church (Episcopal) (oldest church in the city, founded 1692), at the southeast corner of North Charles and East Saratoga Streets in downtown, and was buried at Dulaney Valley Memorial Gardens near Towson in suburban Baltimore County. Legacy In 1978, Schaefer received the U.S. Senator John Heinz Award for Greatest Public Service by an Elected or Appointed Official, an award given out annually by Jefferson Awards.National Winners  public service awards. Jefferson Awards.org. Retrieved April 12, 2014. In 2008, Schaefer moved the \\"Civic Fund\\", which he had established and used while Mayor of Baltimore to make small grants to neighborhoods for projects such as erecting flagpoles or cultivating community gardens, to the Baltimore Community Foundation, adding to it his leftover campaign funds and proceeds from the sale of his house. After its settlement, $1.4 million from the late governor's estate was added in 2012 to this fund. The William Donald Schaefer Civic Fund is a permanent endowment which continues to provide small grants for neighborhood projects. Two years before his death, a statue of Schaefer was unveiled in Baltimore's Inner Harbor as a gift by construction magnate Willard Hackerman. Several buildings have been dedicated in Schaefer's honor: *William Donald Schaefer Building, state office building at the northwest corner of St. Paul and East Baltimore Streets (former bankrupt Merritt Savings & Loan Association building) in downtown Baltimore, Maryland. *William Donald Schaefer Engineering Building at Morgan State University on Hillen Road in northwest city. *William Donald Schaefer Hall at St. Mary's College of Maryland, in St. Mary's County where he served on the Board of Trustees for years *Governor William Donald Schaefer International Terminal (Concourse E) at Baltimore- Washington International Thurgood Marshall Airport (BWI) *William Donald Schaefer Auditorium at The Baltimore City College (a public high school), where Schaefer had graduated in the centennial class of 1939, and was responsible for the funding of $10 million for a major renovation in 1977‚Äì1979.
