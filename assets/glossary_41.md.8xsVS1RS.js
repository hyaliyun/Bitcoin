He coached men's basketball at Long Beach City College, Kent State University, and later served as a National Basketball Association (NBA) assistant coach. He served as head coach for part of a season with the Sacramento Kings, and a single game as an interim coach with the San Antonio Spurs. Hughes also worked in NBA scouting and basketball operations with the Kings, Atlanta Hawks and Orlando Magic. Head Coaching Positions In 1968-1969, Hughes was Head Coach at Long Beach City College, his first collegiate job after coaching in high school. His squad finished 23-5. When Hughes left to be an assistant at Nebraska, he was replaced by Lute Olson, in his first collegiate job. Replacing Frank Truitt at Kent State University in 1974, Hughes' teams went 6-20, 12-14 and 8-19 over the next three seasons. The team started 1-10 in 1977-1978 when he was replaced by Mike Boyd. . In 1978-1979, Hughes was Head Coach and General Manager of the Montana Sky (Great Falls, Montana) in the short-lived Western Basketball Association. The Sky were co-owned by country singer Charlie Pride. Notably, Hughes had Cazzie Russell and Brad Davis on the roster. Hughes was hired by the Sky mid- season when Coach Bill Klukas was fired after a 3-17 start. The league folded after one season. In 1991-1992 Hughes served as an Assistant Coach under Dick Motta with the Sacramento Kings and went 22-35 in 57 games replacing Motta as Head Coach after Motta was fired. In 1992-1993, Hughes was hired to serve as an Assistant Coach to Jerry Tarkanian with the San Antonio Spurs. However, just 20 games into the season at 9-11, Tarkanian was fired. Hughes was 1-0 as interim Head Coach before John Lucas (39-22) was hired.

It consists of 126 multiple-choice questions and the test is scored out of a possible 164 points. The test is composed of five audio sections and one visual section. As of 2009, the test is completely web-based. The test does not attempt to gauge a person's fluency in a given language, but rather to determine their ability to learn a language. The test will give the service member examples of what a selection of words or what a portion of a word means, then asks the test taker to create a specific word from the samples given. Preparation for the DLAB includes multiple study guides and practice tests. These resources give one the appropriate means by which to prepare for the test and gauge a possible outcome. However, a study guide for the DLAB is not like traditional studying - you are not learning content that will be on the DLAB, but rather learning the style of the DLAB. Someone failing the test or getting a low score can always retake the DLAB but only after a wait of 6 months. For most service members, this is too long and will cause them to miss the deadline for submitting their scores. Adequate preparation is thus a near- necessity. The languages are broken into tiers based on their difficulty level for a native English speaker as determined by the Defense Language Institute. The category into which a language is placed also determines the length of its basic course as taught at DLI. To qualify to pursue training in a language, one needs a minimum score of 95. The Marines will waive it to 90 for Cat I and Cat II languages and the Navy will waive it to an 85 for Cat I languages, a 90 for Cat II languages, and a 95 for Cat III languages. The Air Force does not currently offer a waiver. The Army National Guard is able to waive a score of 90 into a Cat. IV language. The DLAB is typically administered to new and prospective recruits at the United States Military Entrance Processing Command sometime after the Armed Services Vocational Aptitude Battery is taken but before a final job category (NEC, MOS, AFSC) is determined. An individual may usually take the DLAB if they score high enough on the ASVAB for linguist training and are interested in doing so. The DLAB is also administered to ROTC cadets while they are still attending college. The DLAB is also used for the Australian Defence Force. Furthermore, the DLAB is a required test for officers looking to either join the Foreign Area Officer program or the Olmsted Scholar Program. The required grade for these programs is a 105, but the recommended grade is at least a 130 or above. Military personnel interested in retraining into a linguist field typically also must pass the DLAB. In few select cases, the DLAB requirement may be waived if proficiency in a foreign language is already demonstrated via the DLPT. Language categoriesDefense Language Institute Foreign Language Center General Catalog *Category I language: 95 or higher (French, Italian, Portuguese, and Spanish) *Category II language: 100 or higher (German, Indonesian) *Category III language: 105 or higher (Hebrew, Hindi, Iranian Persian, Dari Persian, Punjabi, Russian, Serbian/Croatian, Tagalog, Thai, Turkish, Uzbek, and Urdu) *Category IV language: 110 or higher (Modern Standard Arabic, Iraqi Arabic, Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Levantine Arabic and Pashto) While these scores are required to enter a language program of that category, often placement is based upon need rather than score. For example, a service member that receives a score of 115 may be placed in Russian (category III). The maximum score on the DLAB was 176, but has recently been lowered to 164.

Cowdray, \\"Archbishop Aribert II of Milan,\\" History 51 (1966:1-15), and the social and religious conflicts of the archepiscopacy are examined in a chapter devoted to them of Cinzio Violante, La societ√† milanese nell'et√† precomunale (Bari) 1953. Biography The Carroccio of Milan on an ancient miniature Aribert went to Konstanz in June 1025, with other bishops of Northern Italy, to pay homage to Conrad II of Germany, the beleaguered founder of the Salian dynasty. There, in exchange for privileges, he agreed to crown Conrad with the Iron Crown of Lombardy, which the magnates had offered to Odo of Blois.John Bagnell Bury, ed. The Cambridge Medieval History: III. Germany and the Western Empire 1922:264. This he did, on 26 March 1026, at Milan, for the traditional seat of Lombard coronations, Pavia, was still in revolt against imperial authority. He journeyed to Rome a year later for the imperial coronation of Conrad by Pope John XIX on 26 March 1027; at a synod at the Lateran he negotiated a decision of the precedence of the archdiocese of Milan over that of Ravenna.Cambridge Medieval History :264 He subsequently joined an imperial military expedition into the Kingdom of Arles, which Conrad inherited upon the death in 1032 of Rudolph III of Burgundy, but which was contested by Odo. In the political arena of Italy, power was disputed between the great territorial magnates‚Äî the capitanei‚Äî with their vassal captains and the lesser nobility‚Äî the valvassores‚Äî allied with the burghers of the Italian communes. Aribert created enemies among the lower nobility, against whom he perpetrated the worst violences, and with the metropolitan of Ravenna, whose episcopal rights, along with those of the smaller sees, he ignored. A revolt soon engulfed northern Italy and, at Aribert's request, Conrad's son, the Emperor Henry III, travelled south of the Alps in the winter of 1036/37, to quell it. The Emperor, however, took the position of champion of the valvassores and demanded that Aribert should make a defence against charges brought against him, but Aribert refused, on the grounds that he was the emperor's equal. The tomb of Aribert in the Milan Cathedral, with a copy of the Cross of Aribert. His consequent arrest provoked the rebellion of the anti-Imperial faction of the Milanese, seen by 19th- century historians as fiercely patriotic. Aribert had soon escaped his imprisonment and was leading the revolt from Milan. The Emperor found himself unable to take Milan by siege and proceeded to Rome, where his diplomatic skills succeeded in isolating Aribert from his erstwhile allies, notably through his famous decree of 28 May 1037, securing the tenancy of lesser vassals, both imperial and ecclesiastical.Cambridge Medieval History :266. The Emperor took the step of deposing the fighting archbishop, and John's successor Pope Benedict IX excommunicated Aribert in March 1038. That year, he held up the Carroccio as the symbol of Milan and soon it was the symbol of all the Tuscan cities as far as Rome. Aribert ended his episcopacy in relative peace, having agreed to cease hostilities with Henry, at Ingelheim in 1040, reconciled with him and obtained the revocation of his excommunication.storiadimilano.it The cross of Aribert The tomb of Aribert is located in the first span of the right aisle of Milan Cathedral. The archbishop's sarcophagus is surmounted by a copy of the famous crucifix in gilded copper foil (the original is located in the museum of Milan Cathedral) originally donated by Aribert to the monastery of San Dionigi, a convent which was later demolished in 1783. A reproduction of the cross of Aribert is also one of the symbols of victory at the Palio di Legnano. The historical re- enactment takes place every year on the last Sunday of May and concludes with a horse race between the eight contrade Legnanesi:D'Ilario, p. 337. the contrada winner of the competition exposes the cross for a whole year in its own church of reference until the next edition of the prize.

Joe: A Real American Hero toyline, comic books and animated series. They are the co-leaders of Cobra's elite troops, the Crimson Guard, and debuted in 1985. Their preliminary names were Movat and Tovam respectively.Steve Gerber, G.I. Joe Writers' Guide (Sunbow Productions, Inc., 1985), 17. Profile The Paoli brothers speak in notable accents which show they are from Corsica. The brothers were at some point members of the Unione Corse (Corsican Brotherhood), served in the French Foreign Legion's 1erREP in Algeria, then as mercenaries in Africa (Congo, southern Africa) and South America, before changing careers and becoming bankers in Zurich, Switzerland.\\"Intelligence File: Tomax and Xamot\\", Action Force Monthly #10 (March 1989). Unhappy with the world of corporate finance, the brothers found the opportunities available in international terrorism far more suited to their abilities, and joined Cobra. Their specialties are in infiltration, espionage (military and industrial), sabotage, propaganda, and corporate law. Like the Crimson Guard that they lead, Xamot and Tomax also lead the \\"respectable\\" corporate face of Cobra as the founders, owners, and CEOs of Extensive Enterprises. When not engaged in terrorism, they efficiently manage Cobra's business affairs in shirt and tie. Their preferred mode of attack is through brains over brawn, using the law to serve the purposes of Cobra. They have covered their paper trail and connection to Cobra so well, that it is thought to be impossible to prove a connection between them and the terrorist organization. The twin brothers are mirror images of each other; Tomax's hair is parted on the right side of his head and Xamot's on the left;, the piping on their uniforms goes up the opposite side on each twin; the brothers' names are mirror images of one another. The only distinguishing mark between the two is a scar on Xamot's right cheek. Tomax and Xamot share an empathic connection commonly known as \\"The Corsican Syndrome\\" in which identical twins are believed to be psychically bonded, in a manner similar to The Corsican Brothers. While this is often useful, as it allows them to communicate wordlessly, finish each other's sentences, and speak in unison, it is also a liability as they feel each other's pain. Toys Tomax and Xamot were first released as action figures in 1985. Included in their package were laser pistols and a zip-line with skyhook. The filecards for the 2008 version of the figures list their last name as Rogue. Comics= Marvel Comics  In the Marvel Comics G.I. Joe series, the twins first appeared in G.I. Joe: A Real American Hero #37 (July 1985). They fight G.I. Joe forces throughout a busy amusement park, attempting to ambush Gung-Ho and Blowtorch. They are defeated when the Joes play \\"possum\\"; the Twins do not realize the amusement park's ride has stopped their machine gun fire.G.I. Joe: A Real American Hero #37 (July 1985) Their forces, the Crimson Guard, are shown as capable battlefield soldiers and respectable businessmen. As the latter, they are to gain as much economic influence as possible, solely for the benefit of Cobra. A Joe team, assisted by Sierra Gordo revolutionaries, assaults a Cobra fortress, one of many in a style called Terror Drome. During the confrontations, the twins man a helicopter gunship and badly injure Stalker. Other Joes destroy the helicopter but the twins (and Stalker) survive.G.I. Joe: A Real American Hero #55 (Jan. 1987) Later, the Joes completely take the fortress. Having prepared, Tomax and Xamot purposely wait until the Joes are inside before attempting to activate several explosive devices. This fails, as the Joes had brought their own explosive expert, Tripwire.G.I. Joe: A Real American Hero #56 (1987) In issue #109, the Twins and their forces do capture a squad of Joe members. They misinterpret an order from Cobra Commander and incorrectly believe that they must now execute all the Joes. While they are unwilling to outright kill the subdued prisoners, a S.A.W. Viper willingly fires into the prisoners, killing Doc, Heavy Metal, Crankcase and Thunder. The survivors injure the Viper with a hidden knife and escape.G.I. Joe: A Real American Hero #109 (Feb. 1, 1991) In the ensuing pursuit, the prisoners commandeer a Cobra vehicle, which is fired upon by other Cobra forces. Breaker, Crazylegs and Quick Kick are killed while the survivors make it back to Joe territory.G.I. Joe: A Real American Hero #110 (March 1, 1991)  Devil's Due  Years later, in the Devil's Due series, the Twins fall under the influence of Destro's son, who has infected them with multi-function nanites. Their businesses still continue, such as working with Ripper to promote his soda company.G.I. Joe: A Real American Hero Vol.2 #2 (2001) After the nanite threat is neutralized, the twins activate Crimson Guardsmen in order to provide support to the now-free Cobra Commander.G.I. Joe: A Real American Hero Vol.2 #6 (2002) They continue to broker most deals for Cobra. The twins lead the unsuccessful hunt for the Cobra Island Joe infiltrator, \\"Barrel Roll\\",G.I. Joe A Real American Hero Vol.2 #28-30 (2004) and were in charge of the secret construction of Monolith Base in Badhikstan, but after G.I. Joe raided the base, they fled with Cobra Commander to a cave. There, Red Shadows agent Dela Eden arrived and unleashed gunfire on the group. In the G.I. Joe Special Missions: Antarctica one-shot, a Joe team broke up an illegal oil drilling operation that was run by Tomax, who was able to escape. During the story, Xamot was strangely absent. In one scene Tomax talked to his brother as if he were present, despite the scene showing an empty chair. The whereabouts of Xamot were revealed in another story in the same issue, when G.I. Joe raided a Cobra medical facility and found Xamot, in a coma and unresponsive (presumably from the Red Shadows attack). Xamot is then held in G.I. Joe custody, still in a coma. Some months later, Tomax leads a raid on \\"The Coffin\\", a G.I. Joe maximum-security prison located in Greenland, to rescue his brother and free other Cobra operatives.G.I. Joe: America's Elite #30 He successfully frees his brother and several other Cobra agents. Off panel, the invading Cobra forces cause the death of 'loose ends' held at the Coffin, including Cobra operatives Monkeywrench and Dr. Biggles-Jones.G.I. Joe: America's Elite #31 Tomax and Xamot are captured by the Joes in the final battle with Cobra. Both are sent to the Coffin.G.I. Joe: America's Elite #36 Devil's Due - G.I. Joe vs. Transformers Tomax and Xamot also appeared in the second G.I. Joe vs. the Transformers mini-series by Devil's Due. In it, Tomax and Xamot had used Cybertronian technology to become human-looking cyborgs who, when touching each other, shoot a massive blast. In order to avoid them using that power, Shockwave kills Xamot. Tomax later appears, grieving. IDW Publishing In this new IDW continuity, Tomax and Xamot are revealed to be French and originally part of the Unione Corse. They set up their security company Extensive Enterprises, which was co-opted by Cobra; while Tomax enjoys being part of Cobra, he is unaware Xamot has become disgruntled and no longer trusts his brother.Cobra Special #1 Xamot is badly beaten by Chuckles, who then self-destructs a nuclear missile payload on board a Cobra submarine, sacrificing himself and Xamot in the process. Tomax survives.\\"G.I. Joe: Cobra\\" #13 (Feb 2010) Tomax eventually cuts a deal with GI Joe, offering to use his resources through Extensive Enterprises, to help the group find members of Cobra for captured. As part of the deal, Tomax was allowed to operate a casino in Las Vegas to create a cover that he was still involved in criminal activities, under the watchful eyes of Flint. Animated series=Sunbow Tomax and Xamot are first introduced in the G.I. Joe miniseries \\"Pyramid of Darkness\\". They appear as the commanders of the Crimson Guard, as well as the heads of Extensive Enterprises. Unlike the comics, the twins in the cartoon were often cagey, self-interested, and eager to seize power for themselves, although they garner little support from other Cobra members, and their attempts are usually quashed by Cobra Commander. They share a psychic link, and feel one another's pain, which the Joes use to their advantage several times in battle. When the two are together and speaking, they speak in tandem, often finishing each other's sentences. At the beginning of the second season, Tomax and Xamot join Doctor Mindbender and Destro in creating Serpentor, also having grown tired of Cobra Commander's failures. But as soon as Serpentor is brought to life and orders his attack and invasion of the United States, Tomax and Xamot are the first to point out the sheer impossibility of such an attack. Their objections are quickly silenced however when Serpentor begins to throttle them. In the un-produced third season of the original Sunbow/Marvel series, Tomax and Xamot were planned to be the season's main villains, with most of Cobra-La and the Cobra Organization being destroyed at the end of the film. Tomax and Xamot would then form a new criminal organization known as \\"the Coil\\" to fight against the Joes. This season never went into production due to the abrupt cancellation of the series by Hasbro. In the cartoon, Tomax was voiced by Corey Burton and Xamot by Michael Bell. =G.I. Joe: The Movie= In G.I. Joe: The Movie, they side with Cobra-La, and are seen fighting the Joes in the final battle, until a huge explosion destroys all of Cobra-La. DiC Tomax and Xamot are not seen again in the DiC-produced third season. Their old headquarters, the Extensive Enterprises building, is seen, however, and General Hawk mentions that they closed them down. The building itself has been abandoned and is being used as a secret Cobra base. The Crimson Guard, however, are still present, in the form of the Crimson Guard Immortals. However, they are used more as a grunt force, as opposed to an elite group. G.I. Joe: Renegades Tomax and Xamot appear in G.I. Joe: Renegades voiced by Stephen Stanton, dubbing themselves as the \\"Brothers of Light\\" due to their psychic abilities to manipulate others into do their bidding when standing together. Their psychic link is strong to the point of empathy: if one is in pain, the other feels it. Tomax and Xamot use their powers to \\"fleece\\" believers whom they brainwash into their cult with a machine that enhances their psychic abilities, planning on expanding their cult worldwide. The Joes travel to their desert oasis while searching for Doctor Mindbender, who is searching for a psychic for his research. Both fall under their control, who use the latter to siphon Cobra bank accounts and the former as their elite guard of soldiers, named the \\"Crimson Guard\\". Only Tunnel Rat and Snake Eyes manage to stay out of their control as they eventually expose the brothers' deception to their followers. Forced to destroy their base of operations, Tomax and Xamot convince Doctor Mindbender to take them with him to escape retaliation. However, the two soon find themselves being subjected to Mindbender's experiments in improving Bio-Vipers such as creation of the prototype Shadow- Vipers, mentally commanded by Storm Shadow. Later, during the events of the \\"Union of the Snake\\", Cobra attempts to use their abilities to control various telecommunication company heads. After their plan is foiled by the Joes, Tomax and Xamot manage to break free of their bonds and take revenge by mesmerizing Baroness and Mindbender into fighting each other for their amusement, before realizing the need to escape when the authorities arrive. Soon after, the brothers ponder about spreading their cause through telecommunications. Video games Tomax and Xamot are featured as bosses in the 1992 G.I. Joe arcade game. Live action film In G.I. Joe: Retaliation, during the US President's press conference, one of the news vans has the logo for Extensive Enterprises, the Cobra front company run by the Crimson Guard commanders Tomax and Xamot. The twins will be appearing in the third film G.I. Joe: Ever Vigilant.

The band consists of Damian Abraham (vocals), Mike Haliechuk (guitar, vocals), Josh Zucker (guitar), Ben Cook (guitar, vocals), Sandy Miranda (bass) and Jonah Falco (drums, vocals). To date the band has released five studio albums, alongside several EPs, singles, and companion releases. The band won the 2009 Polaris Music Prize for their second studio album, The Chemistry of Common Life. In 2018, the band released its fifth studio album, Dose Your Dreams, after a hiatus. Driven by Haliechuk, it is a concept album focusing on the band's recurring character David, and featuring several guest lead vocalists, alongside Abraham, Falco, and Haliechuk.  History = 2001‚Äì2006  The band formed and played their first shows in early 2001. The initial practicing lineup consisted of 10,000 Marbles (Mike Haliechuk, lead guitar), Concentration Camp (Josh Zucker, rhythm guitar, vocals), Mustard Gas (Sandy Miranda, bass guitar) and Chris Colohan (of Left For Dead/The Swarm fame, who was lead vocalist for Cursed). Just prior to recording their demo tape, Concentration Camp concentrated on guitar duties and vocal duties were taken over from Colohan by Pink Eyes (Damian Abraham, also known as Mr. Damian). Drums were played by Mr. Jo (Jonah Falco, also credited as G. Beat or J. Falco). Following the release of the demo, the band embarked on a long series of 7\\" records. The band released the \\"No Pasaran\\" 7\\" in May 2002. The Police 7\\" was released on March 2003,\\"A Completely Biased Ranking of the 60 Best Canadian Indie Rock Songs of the 00s Part II\\". Vice, Cam Lindsay Apr 10 2017 quickly followed the Baiting the Public 7\\" in May 2003. Two more 7\\"'s followed in 2004, the Dance of Death single, and the Litany 4-song ep. The vinyl releases to this point were collected on 2004s Epics in Minutes CD. The band was the subject of a two-minute 16 mm film showing its links to the Toronto hardcore scene, a local infoshop and punk radio show. The band's use of imagery and symbolism (notable the use of Sigils) took a decided turn after the release of Epics in Minutes, as it was followed by two limited 12\\"s, the Looking for Gold 12\\", and the live Let Likes be Cured by Likes 12\\". The Looking for Gold 12\\" contained no liner notes or credits, no song titles, and a hidden track. It was self-released by the band in 2004 in two limited runs of 300 and 400 copies. The title track was 16 minutes long, used 18 guitar tracks, had a three-minute drum solo and contained 5 minutes of whistling. In the summer of 2004 the band released the Generation 7\\" and 12\\" eps. After touring for most of 2005 the band took on David Eliade as a quasi-full-time manager/promoter. In early 2006 Eliade began shopping demos of songs from the planned Hidden World album to labels, ending with the band signing to Jade Tree Records for an early fall 2006 release of the album. Jade Tree is distributed by Touch & Go which in turn has a distribution agreement with ADA (Warner Music Group). Jade Tree licensed the vinyl version to Deranged Records, which released it as a double album in November 2006. Several other records, such as Year of the Dog 12\\" were released, before the band went on the European tour, visiting England, Germany and Spain, among other places. January 16, 2007 marked the band's live television debut on MTV Live, where they were introduced as \\"Effed Up\\". During their performance of their song \\"Baiting the Public\\", the majority of the audience were moshing and causing damage to the set (also visible was a cut on Damian's forehead), resulting in a sum of $2,000 in damages. This performance sparked controversy and resulted in MTV Canada banning moshing from future MTV Live performances.Vice magazine: Fucked Up Banned From MTV 2008‚Äìpresent On October 9, 2008 the band returned to MTV Live, this time performing in the men's washroom. Once again, the band (and their fans) caused a large amount of damage, destroying the ceiling, spray painting walls and knocking over amps and a motorcycle which was brought into the washroom as a prop. Fans, who were told beforehand to stay out of the washroom and to watch from outside the door, rushed the doors and joined in the destruction the band had already started. The band was supposed to play three songs, but were stopped after the first song as MTV was not aware of the destruction the band had planned and were concerned about the safety of the band, audience and crew. On October 10 Abraham blogged about the performance on the MTV Live website, saying the bathroom performance was \\"f**king out of control terrifying.\\"F**ked Up Explains Bathroom Performance, by Sharlene Chiu, at MTV.ca (via archive.org); published October 10, 2008; retrieved September 23, 2014 Live performance, 2013 In November 2007, the band played a show in New York that was filmed for the movie Burn, directed by Richard Roepnack. The performance was positively reviewed in the New York Times, although the Times chose not to print the band's name, referring to them instead as a string of asterisks. The band signed to Matador Records in Spring of 2008. That summer, Matador reissued the \\"Year Of The Pig\\" 12\\" single. This time it came out with additional formats including a series of three 7\\"es, for the US, UK and Japan respectively, each with a different edit of the A-side and a new B-side. A CDEP compiled all the versions from the various vinyl versions. The band toured extensively in the UK behind this release, following it with a trip up the West Coast. On October 7, 2008, Matador released Fucked Up's second album, \\"The Chemistry Of Common Life.\\" It has received near-universal critical acclaim from publications such as the NME, The New York Times, Blender, Pitchfork, Alternative Press, Q Magazine and many more. The band toured the Eastern US in October, including a much-covered 12-hour long show on the Bowery in New York on October 14. They were joined by musical guests including Ezra Koenig of Vampire Weekend, Moby, John Joseph of the Cro-Mags, members of Endless Boogie, Les Savy Fav, Dinosaur Jr., and others. In November 2008, the band participated with other similarly named bands, including Holy Fuck, Fuck, and Fuck Buttons in the Festival of the Fuck Bands music festival in the village of Fucking, Austria. Abraham at an April 2010 literacy event In 2009, Damian Abraham was invited to become a regular guest (appearing one to three times a month) on the Fox News show Red Eye w/ Greg Gutfeld, which he had previously appeared on twice. In 2009 Fucked Up took part in an interactive documentary series called City Sonic. The series, which featured 20 Toronto artists, had lead singer Damian Abraham inside Rotate This talking about his love of vinyl and punk music. Fucked Up were confirmed to play the ATP New York 2010 music festival in Monticello, New York in September 2010. The band also confirmed they will play their annual Halloween gig in Toronto, October 31, 2010. The band had initially cancelled the event due to scheduled tour with Against Me!. \\"We were going to go on this tour in the UK with this band Against Me!, but then they cancelled all their shows for some reason (they never told us) so the tour isn't happening so we'll be in Toronto so we figure what the hell.\\" They were joined by The Sadies at The Garrison, Toronto. In February 2011, the band toured Australia for the first time as a part of the Soundwave Festival. Additionally, the band played some select side-shows from the festival with artists as diverse as The Bronx, Terror, H20, Trash Talk and Polar Bear Club. On June 7, 2011, Fucked Up released their third studio album, David Comes to Life. A self-professed \\"rock opera\\" set in Thatcherite Britain, it tells a story of love, loss and redemption. The story is complicated by misdirection and unreliable narrators. The record debuted at No. 83 on the Billboard 200 in the US. It has received wide critical acclaim. In November 2011 it was announced that the band would be going on hiatus, as Abraham is not able to handle raising a family and tour the same time. In December 2011, Spin magazine named David Comes to Life its No. 1 Album of 2011, and put the band on the cover, writing \\"Fucked Up have synthesized 40 years of rock into what's ostensibly a hardcore record, and in doing so created its own logic.\\"Spin Staff. SPIN's 50 Best Albums of 2011. Spin. 12 December 2011. Retrieved 3 January 2012. On February 7, 2012, the band was listed as one of the acts to be featured during the Orion Music + More Festival. The event took place June 23‚Äì24, 2012 in Atlantic City, New Jersey and was curated by Metallica. The band was also listed to play Fun Fun Fun Fest in November, 2012, in Austin, Texas. In August 2012, Fucked Up was nominated for the Polaris Music Prize for the second time. The shortlist nomination described David Comes to Life as follows: \\"Excessive? Sure. Ridiculous? At times. Brilliant? Sounds pretty damn close to it.\\" In March 2014, Fucked Up announced their fourth LP, named Glass Boys, which was released by Matador Records on June 3, 2014. Avatars of the band and their songs \\"Paper the House\\" and \\"Queen of Hearts\\" were featured in the 2016 video game \\"LOUD on Planet X\\". In 2016 the band released the Zanzibar soundtrack, recorded in 2011, to Tod Browning's silent movie from 1928 West of Zanzibar starring Lon Chaney. In 2018 the band announced their fifth studio album, Dose Your Dreams which was released on October 5 via Merge Records.

The advertisement apparently portrayed the bands as supporters of Camel. Pink Eyes stated that \\"The fact that Fucked Up was mentioned in there wasn't some great coincidence. This isn't a case of subliminal advertising, where we're claiming that there were penises in the shadows ‚Äî our name is right there. Maybe they thought we were too stupid to know what was going on.\\" On January 28, 2010, The Court of Appeal of the State of California for the First Appellate District reversed the lower court's ruling, saying constitutional principles of freedom of speech and the press require that the lawsuit be dismissed. at the Library of Congress (May 18, 2010).  Collaborations  Fucked Up has collaborated extensively with other artists on record and during live performances. Hidden World features guest instrumentation from Final Fantasy, and guest vocals by Ben Cook of No Warning (2 years before he joined the band), George Pettit and Dallas Green, formerly of Alexisonfire, Chris Colohan of Cursed, and Heidi Hazelton. Year of the Pig was written in part with Max Mccabe-Locos of The Deadly Snakes, who plays piano and organ on the record, and a lead vocal by Jennifer Castle of Castlemusic. In late 2007, the holiday charity single David Christmas featured guest vocals from Nelly Furtado, Davey Havok, David Cross, Shenae Grimes of Degrassi: The Next Generation and Faris Badwan of The Horrors, among others.\\"James Murphy, Nelly Furtado on Fucked Up Holiday 7\\"\\" Pitchfork. On March 15, 2008 at the Mess With Texas Fest in Austin Tx, Circle Jerks singer Keith Morris joined Fucked Up on stage and sang Backed Against the Wall, Beverly Hills, and Nervous Breakdown. On February 6, 2009 at the Echoplex in Los Angeles, they were joined onstage again by Keith Morris of the Circle Jerks to play the Black Flag song Nervous Breakdown.

Proceeds from the single go to benefit three charitable organizations working to publicize the high disappearance rate of Aboriginal women in Canada. On January 21, 2010, Abraham joined Dinosaur Jr. at the Phoenix Concert Theatre in Toronto for the encore, performing vocals on \\"Chunks\\". He made another appearance with Dinosaur on September 26, 2012 at Lee's Palace during the encore, performing the same vocals for \\"Chunks\\". He was accompanied by Murph at the microphone stand, while Harvey Milk (band) drummer Kyle Spence performed drums. On April 15, 2011, Fucked Up released a special Record Store Day exclusive vinyl LP entitled David's Town. It is not billed to Fucked Up, and in fact pretends to be a compilation album documenting the scene in the fictitious UK city of Byrdesdale Spa, the late '70s setting for the band's upcoming \\"rock opera\\" David's Come To Life. Each song featured a guest singer (one was sung by the band's vocalist Abraham, three were sung by other band members), including Danko Jones, Wesley Patrick Gonzalez, Dan Romano, Simone Schmidt, Cee Kay, A.C. Newman and Dylan Baldi.

This piece of Japanese history not only appears in old folklore, it is also very popular in modern fiction as well as contemporary art pieces such as film and theater. The katana has reached far and wide in the world of fictional stories and can be used to tell tales of wisdom and bravery or evil and treachery. The sword can be seen not only as a tool for the hero but also a tool for the villain. Traditional lore Many legends surround Japanese swords, the most frequent being that the blades are folded an immense number of times, gaining magical properties in the meantime. While blades folded hundreds, thousands, or even millions of times are encountered in fiction, there is no record of real blades being folded more than around 20 times. With each fold made by the maker, every internal layer is also folded, and so the total number of layers in a sword blade is doubled at each fold; since the thickness of a katana blade is less than 230 iron atoms, going beyond 20 folds no longer adds meaningfully to the number of layers in the blade. Folding a blade only ten times will therefore create 1024 layers; 20 times will create 1,048,576 layers. Furthermore, while heating and folding serves to even out the distribution of carbon throughout the blade, a small amount of carbon is also 'burnt out' of the steel in this process; repeated folding will eventually remove most of the carbon, turning the material into softer iron and reducing its ability to hold a sharp edge. This can be combated with carburization, though it does not produce even carbon distribution, partially defeating the purpose of folding. Some swords were reputed to reflect their creators' personalities. Those made by Muramasa had a reputation for violence and bloodshed, while those made by Masamune were considered weapons of peace. A popular legend tells of what happens when two swords made by Muramasa and Masamune were held in a stream carrying fallen lotus petals: while those leaves touching the Muramasa blade were cut in two, those coming towards the Masamune suddenly changed course and went around the blade without touching it. Kusanagi (probably a tsurugi, a type of Bronze Age sword which precedes the katana by centuries) is the most famous legendary sword in Japanese mythology, involved in several folk stories. Along with the Jewel and the Mirror, it was one of the three godly treasures of Japan. A common misconception is that Katanas magically sprung into existence in Japan, utterly isolated from the mainland. The technique of folding steel came from the manufacture of the Dao in China, and contact with the mainland would affect how the katana evolved through the centuries. The katana design itself was developed over hundreds of years and the katana design was a development of the Tachi. Modern fiction The most common depiction, especially in the Western world, of the Katana is a weapon of unparalleled power, often bordering on the physically impossible. Katanas are often depicted as being inherently \\"superior\\" to all other weapons possessing such qualities as being impossibly light, nigh-unbreakable and able to cut through nearly anything. By contrast, traditional European weapons are often depicted as clumsy, crude and unwieldy by comparison. It is the prime weapon of choice for Japanese heroes in historical fiction set before the Meiji period. Carrying a non-sealed katana is illegal in present-day Japan, but in fiction this law is often ignored or circumvented to allow characters to carry katana as a matter of artistic license. For instance, some stories state that carrying weapons has been permitted due to a serious increase in crimes or an invasion of monsters from other dimensions. With this law in mind, katana are sometimes used for comic relief in anime and manga set in the present, although this is sometimes replaced by the use of a bokken having surprisingly comparable capabilities. In the film Kill Bill: Volume 1, the main protagonist is permitted to bring her katana on board an airliner; presumably, this is a policy of the fictitious Japanese airline, as other passengers can also be seen carrying swords. Due to the renowned quality of the sword and the mysticism surrounding the relationship between the blade and its wielder, the katana appears in various works of fiction, including film, anime, manga, other forms of literature, and computer games.Strongblade Sword Lore: History / Origin of Japanese Swords It is frequently used by non-Japanese creators, partly due to its status as an easily recognizable icon of Japan and its high reputation as a formidable weapon in skilled hands. Four well-known appearances in Western culture are Bruce Willis' weapon of opportunity in Quentin Tarantino's Pulp Fiction, the Bride's signature weapon in Kill Bill (a film strongly influenced by Japanese samurai movies), the katana used by the main characters in Highlander and the 1975 Tom Laughlin action Western film The Master Gunfighter. Other appearances for the western audience include a pair of Ninjato carried by the character Leonardo in the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles franchise. Ulrich Stern wields one in the first, second and third seasons of Code Lyoko, but gains an additional katana in the fourth season and in Code Lyoko: Evolution. Manga and anime Manga and anime show a prominent feature of katana for specific characters. In the manga Bakuman, the characters while researching on the commonality between the popular manga styles, mentioned Japanese swords are always present in them, including InuYasha, One Piece, Bleach, Gin Tama and various other examples. Bakuman chapter 3, P.14 *In Arifureta: From Commonplace to World's Strongest, the main protagonist Hajime Nagumo improvised his gunsmithing skills to create Tsumehirameki, a unique Kissaki Moroha Zukuri style double edged Katana which he gifted to one of his future lovers Shizuku. Coincidentally, Hajime's gunsmith creation of Tsumehirameki parallels the real-life Tsuneyoshi Murata, a Meiji era military general and firearms designer who created the first Gunto known as Murata-Tou which is of the same double edged Katana design as Tsumehirameki. *In Bleach, all Soul Reapers wields Zanpakuto which take on the form of Japanese swords in their base form. The main protagonist, Ichigo Kurosaki, Zanpakuto, the first Zangetsu's final evolved form is a black blade Katana with immense spiritual powers, able to clash with the strongest opponents such as Soul Reapers Captains and Arrancars. *In Highschool of the Dead, one of the main characters, Saeko Busujima who is a famous Kendo prodigy believed to be on pair with Chiba Sanako, a female swordmaster of Hokushin Itt≈ç-ry≈´. Saeko received a historical Meiji era Gunto which is a Kissaki Moroha Zukuri style Katana personally created by General Murata as her new weapon for fighting zombies. *In One Piece, a large majority of legendary swords are Japanese Katanas, with one of the main characters, Roronoa Zoro having collected a total of five legendary Katanas during his journey with the Straw Hat Pirates, Wado Ichimonji, Sandai Kitetsu, Yubashiri, Shusui and Enma, losing Yubashiri to irreparable damage in combat, later replacing Shusui with Enma one of the two Kozuki Family heirloom swords. *In Shaman King, the main character Yoh Asakura wields Harusame, a Katana originally belonged to his Guardian Ghost, the legendary Samurai Amidamaru, The masterpiece of his best friend Mosuke who created it from Module's father's knife during their childhood. There are also several manga series that were inspired by the Japanese swords. Kamata Kimiko's Katana is one such series; it is heavily imbued with the theme of katana with the story plot following an extraordinary teenage boy with the ability to see the 'spirit forms' of swords. =Sakabat≈ç= The sakabat≈ç (ÈÄÜÂàÉÂàÄ) is a type of katana from Rurouni Kenshin, wielded by Himura Kenshin. It is a ‚Äúreverse-edge sword‚Äù, translated in the English-language dub as a ‚Äúreverse blade sword‚Äù. Some companies have created true replicas of the sakabat≈ç. The sharpened edge is the inward curved, longer side of the blade ‚Äì the opposite of a standard katana ‚Äì making it extremely difficult to kill an opponent; it generally knocks the wielder's enemies \\"senseless\\" rather than killing them. \\"a sakabato [is] a reverse-blade sword: the inner edge is sharpened, rather than the outer one. It can knock his enemies senseless, but doesn't inflict fatal wounds.\\" The only way for the sakabat≈ç to cut is to rotate the hilt by 180 degrees within the hand, thus holding the sword backwards. The sakabat≈ç symbolises Kenshin's oath not to kill again. Video games Video games also provide frequent appearances of the katana, most with unique characteristics. Kaede, the protagonist of the arcade series The Last Blade, Yoshimitsu, the well known ninja from Tekken, and Mitsurugi, the Japanese samurai from the Soul series also wield Katanas as their default weapons. Katana frequently appear in role-playing video games, such as some Elder Scrolls games like Morrowind, Oblivion, Skyrim or Neverwinter Nights, as weapons; often faster than a longsword yet less powerful. The browser video game Touken Ranbu developed by Nitroplus and DMM Games involves the player assuming the role of a sage who has the power to bring historical katana to life. One of the recent appearances of the katana in another video game series is in Left 4 Dead 2, a game made by Valve. Team Fortress 2, another Valve game, also features an unlockable katana, called The Half-Zatoichi. The name comes from the fictional Japanese swordsman Zatoichi. In Final Fantasy VII, the character Sephiroth wields a very long katana. Other games in the Final Fantasy series include a sword called the Masamune, apparently named after the famous Japanese swordsmith. In Ninja Gaiden, protagonist Ryu Hayabusa wields two legendary Japanese swords, the Dragon Sword, a katana which was carved from a Dragon's fang, and the Blade of the Archfiend, a Tachi which was forged from a cursed meteorite. In the Devil May Cry series, Sparda, the father of protagonist Dante, who is a legendary demon weaponsmith, designed one of his masterpieces Yamato after a traditional Japanese katana, which is then wielded by Dante's twin brother Vergil, who is a master of Iaijutsu. In the three video games based on the 2D animated French television show Code Lyoko (Get Ready to Virtualize!, Quest for Infinity, and Fall of X.A.N.A.) Ulrich Stern utilizes his saber to slice and dice monsters. Television Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (1987) deals with it twice. In \\"Ninja Sword of Nowhere\\", an alien spacecraft left a fragment of an alien metal, used to travel between dimensions in a mere microsecond, on Earth thousands of years ago, before a craftsman found the alien metal, forging a Japanese sword. This creates a legend of a sword which allows its owner to show up and disappear whenever he or she wishes.Episode Guide Even \\"Sword of Yurikawa\\" has a plot with an old Japanese sword.

He commanded Union cavalry during the American Civil War and during the Indian Wars. Early life Born in New York City to Irish parents. Devin was a house painter and partner in a paint and varnish company with his brother John for much of his early life, while also serving as a lieutenant colonel in the New York State Militia. Civil War After the start of the Civil War, Devin formed his militia cavalry company into \\"Captain Devin's Independent Company\\" and served as its captain. Late that year, he became Colonel of the 6th New York Volunteer Cavalry, nicknamed the \\"2nd Ira Harris Guards\\", which he would lead for the next year. The regiment's first important service was in the Maryland Campaign of 1862. At the Battle of Antietam, one of its squadrons was involved in the first attacks of the day. At the Battle of Fredericksburg, Devin inherited command of David McMurtrie Gregg's cavalry brigade, when the latter took charge of the brigade of George Dashiell Bayard, who had been killed by Confederate artillery fire. At the Battle of Chancellorsville in 1863, his small brigade was the only cavalry not detached for Brig. Gen. George Stoneman's raid and he successfully led three Union Corps on the stealthy flanking march that preceded the battle. The men of the brigade repeatedly distinguished themselves in the heavy fighting of the battle. They suffered almost 200 casualties in the battle, higher losses than Union cavalry units had seen prior to that time. Devin also led his brigade in the Battle of Brandy Station (June 9, 1863), and took command of Brig. Gen. John Buford's division while Buford commanded the entire right wing of the two-pronged attack on Confederate cavalry. While observing the skirmish line early in the fighting, Devin had his horse shot out from under him. At the Battle of Gettysburg, Devin's brigade served in Brig. Gen. John Buford's cavalry division that began the battle on July 1, 1863. Devin had become a favorite of Buford's and his rugged leadership style lent him the nickname \\"Buford's Hard Hitter,\\" while his own men like to refer to him as \\"Uncle Tommy.\\" As the Confederate attacks began, Devin's brigade was screening the northwest and northern road approaches to Gettysburg, and successfully delayed the arrival of Jubal A. Early's division. Friendly fire from Union artillery on Cemetery Hill caused most of his brigade to withdraw into the town of Gettysburg and they later skirmished with the Confederates as they entered the town. The two brigades of Buford's cavalry division present on the field on July 1 and 2 were withdrawn from the battlefield by Cavalry Corps commander Alfred Pleasonton on the afternoon of July 2. After Gettysburg, Devin continued to command a brigade and sometimes a division in the Cavalry Corps of the Army of the Potomac. In the spring of 1864, he participated in the raid on Richmond by Judson Kilpatrick's cavalry. In August he accompanied the Cavalry Corps to the Shenandoah Valley, where they fought under Maj. Gen. Philip Sheridan during the Valley Campaigns of 1864. Devin was wounded once during the war, a wound in the foot on August 16, 1864, at the fighting at Guard Hill, Virginia or Crooked Run, Virginia. When Wesley Merritt became the Cavalry Corps commander, Devin inherited command of his division. On November 19, 1864, President Abraham Lincoln appointed Devin brigadier general of volunteers for his part in the Battle of Cedar Creek, to rank from October 19, 1864. The President submitted the nomination on December 12, 1864, and the U.S. Senate confirmed it on February 14, 1865.Eicher, John H., and David J. Eicher, Civil War High Commands. Stanford: Stanford University Press, 2001. . p. 720 Devin was mustered out of the volunteer service on January 15, 1866. On January 13, 1866, President Andrew Johnson nominated Devin for appointment to the brevet grade of major general of volunteers, to rank from March 13, 1865, and the U.S. Senate confirmed the appointment on March 12, 1866.Eicher, 2001, p. 711 President Johnson also appointed Devin brevet colonel in the regular army for Fisher's Hill, to rank from March 2, 1867.Eicher, 2001, p. 208 On March 26, 1867, President Johnson nominated Devin for appointment to the brevet grade of brigadier general in the regular army for Sayler's Creek, to rank from March 2, 1867, and the U.S. Senate confirmed the appointment on April 5, 1867.Eicher, 2001, p. 733 Postbellum career Devin obtained a commission in the Regular Army after the Civil War under the provisions of the Army Act of 1866. This Act required that the officer ranks of the new infantry and cavalry regiments be filled by a certain percentage of officers from the Volunteer regiments raised during the Civil War. Ending the war as a Brigadier General and Brevet Major General, Devin became a Lieutenant Colonel and was assigned to the 8th U.S. Cavalry. Initially serving with part of the regiment in New Mexico, Devin assumed command of the Subdistrict of Prescott in Arizona in late 1867. He died of stomach cancer and exposure, on sick leave from active duty, as Colonel of the 3rd U.S. Cavalry. Devin was initially interred in Calvary Cemetery on Long Island, but upon his wife's death in 1897, both were interred in West Point Cemetery, West Point, New York, very near his old friend and commander John Buford. Memorialization On June 30, 1878, the United States Army established a temporary camp in southeastern Montana Territory during the building of the Fort Keogh-Deadwood Telegraph Line. The post was named \\"Camp Devin.\\" It served as a base for part of the 9th U.S. Infantry until being abandoned later that year. In popular media Devin was portrayed by David Carpenter in the 1993 film Gettysburg, based on Michael Shaara's novel, The Killer Angels.

Mora (born 1951) is a former General Counsel of the Navy. He led an effort within the Defense Department to oppose the legal theories of John Yoo and to try to end the use of torture at Guantanamo Bay. Mora is featured in two documentaries: the 2008 Academy Award-winning Taxi to the Dark SideThe Internet Movie Database (IMDb) and Torturing Democracy. Early life Mora was born in Boston, Massachusetts and grew up in Cuba. His father, a medical doctor and professor, is Cuban, and his mother's parents are from Hungary, which they fled in advance of active Hungarian-German cooperation in 1941. Mora's family fled Cuba after the Cuban Revolution of 1959 when Mora was eight years old. Mora's family relocated to Jackson, Mississippi, where Mora lived until leaving for college. He received a B.A., with honors, from Swarthmore College in 1974. Career From 1975 to 1978 he worked for the U.S. State Department as a foreign service officer at the U.S. embassy in Lisbon, Portugal. He left to enter law school at the University of Miami School of Law, where he received his J.D. in 1981. He worked in litigation at a number of firms, until returning to government work. From 1989 to 1993, he served in the administration of the President George H.W. Bush as general counsel to the United States Information Agency. He was later appointed three times by President Bill Clinton to the Broadcasting Board of Governors, which oversees the Voice of America and other U.S. information services. He also worked as an Of Counsel attorney with the prominent law firm of Greenberg Traurig, at their Washington office, focusing on matters of international law. Mora speaks Spanish, French, and Portuguese. He is a member of the Council on Foreign Relations. In 2001, President George W. Bush appointed Mora as the General Counsel of the Navy, the most senior civilian lawyer for the Navy, after a recommendation by former U.S. Secretary of Defense Frank Carlucci, who is friends with Mora. Mora was in the Pentagon on September 11, 2001, when it was struck by the Boeing 757 of American Airlines Flight 77. Mora said that it \\"felt jarring, like a large safe had been dropped overhead.\\" Mora retired from the Federal Government in January 2006. He became the chief counsel for Wal- Mart's international division and later served as general counsel and secretary of Mars, Inc. Campaign against torture at Guantanamo Bay In December 2002, Mora received word from David Brant, director of the Naval Criminal Investigative Service (NCIS), that NCIS agents at the naval base at Guant√°namo Bay, Cuba had learned that detainees being held there were being subjected to \\"physical abuse and degrading treatment\\" by members of the Joint Task Force 170 (JTF-170), and that authorization for this treatment had come from \\"a 'high level' in Washington\\". Mora reports that he was \\"disturbed\\" and felt he had to learn more. Mora described his reaction to learning of the authorization for coercive interrogation techniques in these words: > To my mind, there's no moral or practical distinction [between cruelty and > torture]. If cruelty is no longer declared unlawful, but instead is applied > as a matter of policy, it alters the fundamental relationship of man to > government. It destroys the whole notion of individual rights. The > Constitution recognizes that man has an inherent right, not bestowed by the > state or laws, to personal dignity, including the right to be free of > cruelty. It applies to all human beings, not just in America‚Äîeven those > designated as 'unlawful enemy combatants.' If you make this exception, the > whole Constitution crumbles. It's a transformative issue... > Besides, my mother would have killed me if I hadn't spoken up. No Hungarian > after Communism, or Cuban after Castro, is not aware that human rights are > incompatible with cruelty. The debate here isn't only how to protect the > country. It‚Äôs how to protect our values.\\" Investigation of Joint Task Force techniques Mora and Brant met with Rear Admiral Michael Lohr, the Judge Advocate General of the Navy, and Dr. Michael Gelles, the Chief Psychologist of the NCIS, and learned more about the Guantanamo interrogation practices, and determined that they were \\"unlawful and unworthy of the military services\\", and that they would investigate further. Mora obtained a copy of a request by the commander of JT-170, Major General Michael Dunlavey, to Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld for authorization to apply extraordinary interrogation techniques, including \\"stress positions, hooding, isolation, 'deprivation of light and auditory stimuli', and use of 'detainee-individual phobias (such as fear of dogs) to induce stress; a legal brief accompanying the request that supported the legality of such techniques, by the Senior Judge Advocate to JT-170, Lieutenant Colonel Diane Beaver; and an approval of the request by Rumsfeld. The legal brief held that \\"cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment could be inflicted on the Guantanamo detainees with near impunity\\". Mora found the brief to be \\"a wholly inadequate analysis of the law\\" and that the approved request was \\"fatally grounded on these serious failures of legal analysis\\" because it provided no bright line standard for what techniques would be prohibited; the techniques it approved \\"could produce effects reaching the level of torture\\"; and that \\"even if the techniques as applied did not reach the level of torture, they almost certainly would constitute 'cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment, and either way would be unlawful. In the following weeks, Mora actively argued with a large number of the most senior lawyers and officials of the military and the Defense Department that the interrogation techniques that had been approved were unlawful. On January 15, 2003, he received word from William Haynes, the General Counsel of the Department of Defense, that Rumsfeld would be suspending the authority for the extraordinary interrogation techniques later that day. Mora was \\"delighted\\" and \\"reported the news widely\\". Working Group and Yoo Memo Two days later, Rumsfeld directed Haynes to establish a Working Group to develop a new set of guidelines for interrogation techniques, headed by Mary L. Walker, General Counsel of the Air Force. Mora worked actively to establish interrogation guidelines prohibiting coercive interrogation techniques, citing scientific evidence that they were ineffective, as well as legal arguments that they were unlawful. However, early in the process, the Working Group was provided with a legal brief from the Department of Justice Office of Legal Counsel (OLC), and told they should follow its guidance. This was the same brief that later became infamous as the \\"Torture Memo\\", largely written by OLC deputy director John Yoo. Mora regarded the OLC memo as lengthy and seemingly sophisticated, but otherwise identical to the Beaver brief he had already argued against. Mora argued against the conclusions of the OLC memo, arguing that the OLC memo was \\"fundamentally in error\\" and \\"virtually useless as guidance... and dangerous.\\" With Walker's encouragement to share his views, he circulated an opposing draft memo, entitled \\"Proposed Alternative Approach to Interrogations\\". But, according to Mora, contributions from members of the Working Group began to be rejected if they did not conform to what was already in the OLC memo, and Walker, the head of the Working Group, said of his arguments, \\"I disagree and moreover I believe [the General Counsel of the Defense Department] disagrees.\\" Mora evaluated the work being prepared by the Working Group as containing \\"profound mistakes in its legal analysis\\" and as \\"unacceptable\\". Mora met with DOD General Counsel Haynes who disagreed with Mora's arguments. Walker invited the author of the OLC memo, John Yoo, to meet with the senior DOD lawyers, both uniformed and civilian at the Pentagon, which Yoo did twice, explaining the cases in detail and the President's authority and responding to all questions. Mora met with Yoo, who defended the Justice Department's legal analysis, and told Mora the President had the authority to order the application of torture, not that he should but that the Commander in Chief had the authority to do so for the safety of the nation. Mora then met with Haynes, and advised him of his opinion that the Working Group's legal analysis, taken from the Department of Justice legal memorandum, was flawed, and should be put in a drawer and \\"never... see the light of day again.\\" The Working Group never relied upon the extreme power of the Commander in Chief as the additional techniques they recommended did not approach what could be construed as torture. The Working Group voted unanimously to send forth the recommended techniques to Secretary Rumsfeld, who adopted the majority of them. The Administration later asked the Justice Department to review the adopted techniques, which they did, finding them consistent with law. John Yoo did not participate in the later analysis. Aftermath After that, Mora never saw a final report of the Working Group, and assumed that it had been abandoned. He learned otherwise only in May 2004, when he heard it referenced in televised reports on the Abu Ghraib scandal, and received confirmation from the Deputy General Counsel of the Air Force that a final draft of the Working Group's report had been signed out and delivered to the Joint Task Force Guantanamo commander, Major General Geoffrey Miller, who had also been subsequently sent to Abu Ghraib to \\"Gitmo-ize\\" it. Mora is a Senior Fellow at the Carr Center for Human Rights of the John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University. For his efforts, Mora was honored with the John F. Kennedy Profile in Courage Award in 2006, which is administered by the John F. Kennedy Library Foundation.

He was a nephew of his predecessor, Emperor Lizong, and reigned from 1264 until his death in 1274. His birth name was Zhao Mengqi but his name was changed to Zhao Zi in 1251 and finally to Zhao Qi in 1253 after he was designated as Emperor Lizong's heir apparent. Duzong's reign was filled with rebellions and warfare; the court was dominated by his chancellor Jia Sidao and Duzong himself gave in into drinking and women, thus abandoning his duties. He died in 1274 leaving behind three young boys, one of whom took the throne as Emperor Gong. He is the last Emperor of the Song to issue coins; subsequent Emperors were too busy fighting the Mongols to establish mints to cast any coins and did not have enough resources. Early life Emperor Duzong's mother Huang Dingxi wanted to have an abortion because she thought she was of low social status so she took drugs in an futile attempt to abort Duzong. Duzong was born anyway but the drugs affected him in many ways such as that his intelligence was lower than an average person, his hand and feet were soft; using them in an awkward fashion and he couldn't even speak until he was seven years old. He was Yurui's only son. Like his uncle Zhao Yun, he lived in Shaoxing. Discovery Duzong was discovered by his paternal uncle Zhao Yun, better known as Emperor Lizong in 1253, who was sonless and therefore had no heirs so to compensate, adopted Duzong and designated him crown prince in 1260, an action historians still view as confusing. Emperor Lizong died in 1264 and Emperor Duzong then ascended the throne. Reign Emperor Duzong's reign was plagued with rebellions, warfare and corruption in his court; many officials accused the chancellor Jia Sidao of corruption but Duzong trusted Jia Sidao who Duzong honoured by bowing down to Jia even calling him \\"teacher\\" and according to anecdotes, when Jia was considering resigning, Duzong knelt down in tears begging Jia to remain in office. Emperor Duzong ignored his duties and instead delegated all state and military affairs to the hands of Jia Sidao; the emperor instead indulged in drinking, women, and lived in opulence. To make things even worse, Duzong‚Äôs intelligence was lower than a normal person and he was often depressed. At first, he told the officials to be straightforward and tell him the problems in the countries, but this was all an act. Soon, he completely neglected his duties. Furthermore, he had a very high sexual appetite. Under Song laws, any woman who had sexual relations with the emperor had to pay respects to the emperor every morning. At one point, there were as many as 30 women paying their respects to Emperor Duzong in one morning. Duzong also gave official documents to four of his most favored women.  Mongol Invasion  Like his uncle, Duzong was incompetent when dealing with the Mongols. The Mongols had spent decades harassing the Song Empire's borders and were on the verge of conquering the whole of China. Emperor Duzong however, ignored this problem instead choosing to drink and indulging in sex because when Duzong heard that Xiangyang was being besieged by Mongol troops, Duzong asked Jia Sidao \\"I hear that Xiangyang had been besieged by the Yuan troops for several years. Is this true?\\" in which Jia said in all seriousness \\"Well, I haven't heard such a thing.\\" Duzong replied with \\"A palace maid told me this.\\" = Siege of Xiangyang = Lu Wenhuan sent a messenger to Emperor Duzong, to request immediate reinforcements to defend Xiangyang. The messenger successfully got by the Yuan forts and reached the emperor but upon hearing the effectiveness of these new trebuchets, the emperor considered Xiangyang lost and did not send reinforcements. The decisive Battle of Xiangyang was fought in 1274 when the Mongols succeeded in capturing and destroying the last Song stronghold. The loss of Xiangyang sealed the fate of the Song dynasty and the news of its capture was deliberately hidden from Emperor Duzong by Jia Sidao.  Death  Emperor Duzong died shortly thereafter from overindulgence in wine but Richard Davis and other sources claim that, Duzong died suddenly from a severe negligence of a Palace Doctor.The Palace doctor was exiled. In any case, he was succeeded by his sixth son, Zhao Xian (Emperor Gong), who was then only four years old. Although Emperor Duzong was technically not the last emperor of the Song dynasty, historians see him as the last Song emperor who could have made decisions that would've significantly halted or even prevented the fall of the dynasty. Emperor Duzong was buried in the Yongshao Mausoleum on January 1275.Song Shi: ‚ÄúIn August, Emperor Duanwen Mingwu Jingxiao, temple name Duzong died.

The plot follows the wife and mistress of an abusive schoolmaster who find themselves stalked by an unknown assailant after murdering him and disposing of his body. The film is a remake of the French film Les Diaboliques (1955) directed by Clouzot, which was based on the novel She Who Was No More () by Pierre Boileau and Thomas Narcejac. Plot  Mia Baran is a devout Catholic schoolteacher at a boys' school outside Pittsburgh where her husband, Guy, is schoolmaster. Guy is abusive to the weak Mia, a former nun who suffers from cardiomyopathy; his mistress, Nicole Horner, a fellow teacher at the school, is protective of Mia. When both women grow tired of his abuses, they collaborate to murder him in an apartment owned by a family friend of Nicole's. The women lure him there, and Mia drugs him before they successfully drown him in a bathtub. They wrap his body in a shower curtain and place it in a wicker box. While en route to the school, Nicole crashes Guy's car in a pileup on the interstate, but the wicker box goes unnoticed by authorities. The women arrive at the school in the middle of the night, and dump Guy's corpse in the unkempt swimming pool on the property, staging his death as an accidental drowning. When his body fails to rise to the surface after several days, Nicole has the pool drained, but Guy's body is nowhere to be found. The women subsequently discover photos taken of them on the day of Guy's murder, and believe someone is blackmailing them. After reading about the discovery of a John Doe in a nearby river, Mia goes to view the body at the sheriff's station, but finds it is not Guy. There, she attracts the attention of Shirley Vogel, a retired police officer-turned- private investigator who offers to look into Guy's disappearance. Nicole is resistant, and Shirley quickly becomes suspicious of the women. Their fears of a blackmailer are confirmed when Mia discovers the shower curtain used to conceal Guy's body hanging in her bathroom window. Shirley confronts Mia with the accident report from Guy's car, and surmises that Guy was en route to see her in Pittsburgh on the day he disappeared. Mia grows increasingly paranoid, believing Guy is alive and stalking the women. This fear increases when two videographers filming an event at the school capture an image of Guy standing in one of the building's windows. Later, while investigating the school's basement, Shirley is attacked and knocked unconscious. That night, Mia finds Guy floating in her bathtub, and witnesses him rise from the water. Terrified, she loses consciousness and collapses, apparently suffering a heart attack. Nicole arrives, and it is revealed that she and Guy had planned the series of events to scare Mia to the point of heart failure. Nicole laments, however, and tells Guy she had wanted to call it off. While overlooking Mia's body, Nicole realizes she is in fact not dead; when Guy realizes she is alive, he attacks both women, knocking Nicole unconscious. Mia flees downstairs, and Guy tackles her to the ground in front of the pool and attempts to drown her. Nicole manages to stop him by driving a garden rake into his head, and he falls into the pool. As Nicole attempts to revive Mia, Guy pulls her into the pool and tries to drown her. Mia enters the pool, and together, both women successfully drown him. They exit the pool and are confronted by Shirley, who punches Mia in the face; willing to cover for the women, she explains it will help prove self-defense in Guy's murder. Mia walks away from the pool, distraught, and Shirley smokes a cigarette while watching Guy's body sink to the bottom.

The adults resemble crane flies except with a projecting anal angle in the wings, and different head shape, absence of the V on the mesonotum, and more laterally outstretched, forward-facing legs. They are uncommon, but dozens of genera occur worldwide, and over 200 species. They are found near fast-flowing streams where the larvae live. Blepharicerid larvae are filter feeders and have suckers on their abdominal sternites, used to adhere to rocks in the torrents in which they live. These suckers are sometimes called creeping welts. These are of unique evolutionary origin within the Diptera. One recent classification based largely on fossils treats this family as the sole member of its infraorder, but this has not gained wide acceptance.

The film follows a group of young people who stumble upon a roadside museum housing mannequins that wield supernatural powers. Schmoeller co-wrote the script with J. Larry Carroll who served as producer for the film alongside famous producer/director Charles Band. Plot Eileen and her boyfriend Woody are driving through the desert. When their car gets a flat, Woody goes to find a gas station. Their friends Becky, Jerry, and Molly are traveling separately in a different vehicle. They reach Eileen waiting at the car and they all drive off to collect Woody. Woody has found a gas station but it appears deserted. He enters the back room but becomes trapped. Various mannequins appear in the room, and multiple objects fly at him until a metal pipe impales and kills him. The others find a tourist trap and conclude Woody is there. As they drive in, their vehicle mysteriously breaks down. Jerry tries to fix his jeep and the girls go skinny dipping in a nearby oasis. As they swim, Mr. Slausen‚Äîthe owner of said tourist trap‚Äîappears, holding a shotgun. Though outwardly polite, he also seems embittered by the decline of his tourist trap since the highway was moved away. The nude girls feel awkward in the water as he chats and they apologize for trespassing. Slausen offers to help Jerry with the jeep, but insists the group go to his house with him to get his tools. There, they see the tourist trap: animated waxwork figures, including armed bandits. Eileen is curious about a nearby house, but Slausen insists that the women should stay inside the museum. Slausen takes Jerry to fix the jeep, leaving the women. Eileen leaves to find a phone in the other house. There, she finds several mannequins inside the house. Someone calls her name, and a stranger wearing a grotesque mask suddenly appears behind her. Various items in the room move of their own accord and the scarf Eileen is wearing tightens and strangles her to death. Slausen returns to Molly and Becky saying that Jerry drove his truck into town. When told that Eileen left, he goes to the house and finds Eileen has been turned into a mannequin. He returns and tells Molly and Becky he did not find Eileen and will leave again to continue the search. The women are frustrated, and later leave the museum to search for Eileen. Becky enters the nearby house and finds a mannequin resembling Eileen. Becky is attacked by the masked killer and then by multiple mannequins. She later wakes up tied up in the basement along with Jerry. Jerry says the killer is Slausen's brother. Also held captive is Tina (Dawn Jeffory), who is strapped to a table. She is killed when the masked man covers her face with plaster, causing her to suffocate. Jerry frees himself and attacks the killer, but is soon overpowered. Jerry tries to reach for a key but the killer telekinetically moves it from his reach. Molly is still outside and searching for the others. She is soon pursued by the masked man. She meets Slausen, who drives her to the museum and gives her a gun while he goes inside. The masked man appears and Molly shoots, but the gun is loaded with blanks. The man removes the mask, revealing himself to be Slausen. She panics and tries to elude Slausen but is soon captured and restrained to a bed. Becky and Jerry escape from the basement but get separated. Slausen appears and takes Becky to the museum. There, the Old West figures begin shooting at her. Becky is killed by an Indian Chief figure who throws a knife at her, stabbing her in the back of the head. Back at the house, Jerry arrives to rescue Molly, but he is revealed to have been unknowingly turned into a mannequin. Slausen dances with the figure of his wife, and Molly sees that the wife has become animated. Traumatized, she kills Slausen with an axe. The next morning, an insane Molly is seen driving away in the jeep with the mannequin versions of her friends. Cast * Chuck Connors as Mr. Slausen * Jocelyn Jones as Molly * Jon Van Ness as Jerry * Robin Sherwood as Eileen * Tanya Roberts as Becky * Dawn Jeffory- Nelson as Tina * Keith McDermott as Woody * Shailar Coby as Davey Production=Conception The screenplay for Tourist Trap was written by David Schmoeller and J. Larry Carroll, the latter of whom pitched the film to producer Charles Band. Initially, Schmoeller intended for John Carpenter to direct the film, but Carroll was unsatisfied with the financial arrangements, and opted instead that Schmoeller should direct. Carroll and Schmoeller had previously pitched the film to producers Samuel Z. Arkoff and Bruce Cohn Curtis, but were unable to secure a production arrangement. The original screenplay did not feature the telekinetic powers; according to Carroll, the idea was proposed by Band, who insisted it be implemented into the script. Casting The production did not appoint a casting director for the film, instead relying on independent talent agents to help cast the roles. According to director Schmoeller, $50,000 of the film's budget was dedicated to salary for the lead actor portraying the villain, Mr. Slausen. The role was offered to several older Hollywood actors, such as Jack Palance and Gig Young, but both turned the project down. Chuck Connors, who was the production crew's third choice for the role, accepted the role. According to Schmoeller, each of the actors in the film aside from Connors auditioned for their parts. Jocelyn Jones was cast as the female lead, Molly, after Schmoeller had seen some of her previous performances, while Tanya Roberts was given the role of Becky. Jon Van Ness and Robin Sherwood were given the roles of Jerry and Eileen, respectively. Filming Tourist Trap was filmed in 24 days in Los Angeles County, California, with additional interiors shot at Rampart Sound Studios in Los Angeles. Principal photography began on March 27, 1978. A portion of the interior scenes were shot at an abandoned house located at 5255 Hollywood Boulevard which was scheduled for demolition. Schmoeller made arrangements with the contractor to postpone the demolition of the building for five days, during which time the crew shot footage. By using the abandoned location, the production saved an estimated $30,000 in set construction and soundstage fees. David Wyler, the son of William Wyler, served as second assistant director, while the director of photography was Nicholas von Sternberg, son of Josef von Sternberg. Production designer Robert A. Burns, who had worked on Tobe Hooper's The Texas Chain Saw Massacre (1974) and Wes Craven's The Hills Have Eyes (1977), handled the art direction‚Äîand the majority of the special effects‚Äîon Tourist Trap, including the mannequins and their physical manipulations. To accomplish the poltergeist-like effects in the film's opening scene, the set was constructed at a rotated 90 degrees; this allowed items to be hurled by the crew from the cabinet‚Äîwhich was, in fact, anchored to the ceiling‚Äîto the floor, which appeared on camera as a wall. Other special effects were accomplished with the use of wires. For the death sequence of Tanya Roberts's character, for example, a block of wood was taped behind Roberts's hair; a knife attached to a wire was hurled at the back of her head, which stuck into the wooden block. Schmoeller recalled the filming process as being a \\"learning\\" experience as he was a first-time director, stating in a 2014 interview that he learned a significant amount of \\"how to work with actors\\" from actress Jones. Music Italian composer Pino Donaggio was in town working on Joe Dante's Piranha (1978) at the time that David Schmoeller was filming Tourist Trap. Since Donaggio spoke Spanish ‚Äì as did Schmoeller ‚Äì the director was able to convince the composer to score the music for Tourist Trap. The two would have subsequent collaborations, including Crawlspace (1986). Release According to the American Film Institute Catalog, the film premiered in Los Angeles, California on March 14, 1979. Despite its depictions of violence and macabre images, the Motion Picture Association of America awarded the film a PG rating. Because of its rating, the film was able to receive significant broadcasting on syndicated television in the years following its theatrical release. Critical reception From contemporary reviews, Variety wrote, \\"Although pic has some appropriately menacing music and occasionally employs some decent special effects, the plot is too loaded with cliches, from the concept to individual bits of dialog to be taken seriously and not silly enough to be regarded as delightfully bad.\\" Charles Champlin of the Los Angeles Times wrote that the film \\"has some moments of effectiveness, but even the hard-line shiverists are likely to feel it's a long time between shrieks.\\" Tim Pulleine of the Monthly Film Bulletin called the film a \\"wholly unimaginative exercise in low-budget horror plunders Psycho for its central plot gimmick in a fashion even more hamfisted than it is bare- faced.\\" and, that \\"Nothing much is made of the potentially sinister import of the wax dummies, by comparison with whom the human performers also fail to come off too well\\" From retrospective reviews, Author and film critic Leonard Maltin gave the film one and a half out of four stars, stating that although the film had a couple of genuine scares, it was a \\"mostly boring thriller\\". Author Stephen King, in his book Danse Macabre (1981), praised the film as an obscure classic, noting that the film \\"wields an eerie spooky power, as wax figures begin to move and come to life in a ruined, out-of-the-way tourist resort.\\" Jason Buchanan from AllMovie praised the film, calling it \\"one of the most underappreciated low-budget horror films of the 1970's\\". In his review on the film, Buchanan commended the film's atmosphere, score, Conners' performance, and unsettling use of sound and imagery; comparing it to Tobe Hooper's The Texas Chain Saw Massacre. TV Guide awarded the film two out of four stars, calling it a \\"bizarre, eerie shocker.\\" The film was satirized by RiffTrax on November 21, 2012. Home media The film was released on DVD by Cult Video on July 20, 1998. It was re-released on DVD by Wizard Entertainment on March 19, 2013. Full Moon Features released the film for the first time on Blu-ray on May 20, 2014. The Full Moon Blu-ray release features a truncated version of the film; though the film's violent scenes remain intact, minor plot points are absent from this cut of the film.

He is the co- inventor of a rotavirus vaccine. Offit is the Maurice R. Hilleman Professor of Vaccinology, professor of pediatrics at the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania, former chief of the Division of Infectious Diseases (1992‚Äì2014), and the director of the Vaccine Education Center at The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia. He has been a member of the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices. Offit is a board member of Every Child By Two and a Founding Board Member of the Autism Science Foundation (ASF). Offit has published more than 130 papers in medical and scientific journals in the areas of rotavirus-specific immune responses and vaccine safety, and is the author or co-author of books on vaccines, vaccination, and antibiotics. He is one of the most public faces of the scientific consensus that vaccines have no association with autism. As a result, he has been the frequent target of hate mail and death threats. Life Offit grew up in Baltimore, the son of a shirtmaker. He went to his father's sales meetings and reacted negatively to the tall tales told by salespeople, instead preferring the clean and straightforward practice of science. When he was five years old, he was sent to a polio ward to recover from clubfoot surgery; this experience caused him to see children as vulnerable and helpless, and motivated him through the 25 years of the development of the rotavirus vaccine. Podcast (MP3). Retrieved 2009-05-13. Offit decided to become a doctor, the first in his family. Offit earned his bachelor's degree from Tufts University and his M.D. from the University of Maryland, Baltimore. One of his mentors at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia was Maurice Hilleman, who developed several of the major vaccines in use today. By 2008 Offit had become a leading advocate of childhood immunizations. He was opposed by vaccine critics, many of whom believe vaccines cause autism, a belief that has been rejected by major medical journals and professional societies. He received a death threat and received protection by an armed guard during meetings at the CDC. His 2008 book Autism's False Prophets catalyzed a backlash against the antivaccine movement in the U.S. He donated the royalties from the book to the Center for Autism Research at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia. Offit serves on the board of the American Council on Science and Health. In 2015, Dr. Offit appeared in a vaccine awareness video created by Robert Till in which he advocated for teenage vaccinations. Rotavirus vaccine Paul Offit (right) along with H. Fred Clark. Clark and Offit are two of the three inventors of the rotavirus vaccine RotaTeq, which is credited with saving hundreds of lives a day. Offit worked for 25 years on the development of a safe and effective vaccine against rotavirus, which is a cause of diarrhea, and which kills almost 600,000 children a year worldwide, about half as many as malaria kills; most deaths are outside the West. His interest in the disease stemmed from the death of a 9-month-old infant from rotavirus-caused dehydration while under his care as a pediatric resident in 1979. Along with his colleagues Fred Clark and Stanley Plotkin, Offit invented RotaTeq, a pentavalent rotavirus vaccine manufactured by Merck & Co. Since 2006, RotaTeq has been one of two vaccines currently used against rotavirus. In February 2006, RotaTeq was approved for inclusion in the recommended U.S. vaccination schedule, following its approval by the Food and Drug Administration. Premarketing studies found that RotaTeq was effective and safe, with an incidence of adverse events comparable to placebo. RotaTeq has been credited (by Peter Hotez) with saving hundreds of lives a day. Offit received an unspecified sum of money for his interest in RotaTeq. Offit was elected a fellow of the Committee for Skeptical Inquiry, in 2015. Smallpox vaccine In 2002, during a period of fears about bioterrorism, Offit was the only member of the CDC's advisory panel to vote against a program to give smallpox vaccine to tens of thousands of Americans. He later argued on 60 Minutes II and The NewsHour with Jim Lehrer that the risk of harm for people getting the vaccine outweighed the risk of getting smallpox in the U.S. at the time.  Action against dietary supplements and alternative medicine  In December 2013, Sarah Erush and Offit declared the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia has a moratorium on the use of dietary supplements without certain manufacturers' guarantee for quality. :Our hospital has acted to protect the safety of our patients. No longer will we administer dietary supplements unless the manufacturer provides a third-party written guarantee that the product is made under the F.D.A.‚Äôs ‚Äúgood manufacturing practice‚Äù (G.M.P.) conditions, as well as a Certificate of Analysis (C.O.A.) assuring that what is written on the label is what‚Äôs in the bottle. Offit defines alternative medicine as quackery when it involves unappreciated harm and replacement of conventional therapies that work, with alternative therapies that don't. His books and articles warn against expense and risk to health for recipients of alternative therapies. In 2013 Offit wrote the book Do you believe in Magic? ‚Äì The Sense and Nonsense of Alternative Medicine. Offit states that the purpose of the book \\"is to take a critical look at the field of Alternative Medicine ‚Äì to separate fact from myth.\\" and that \\"There's only medicine that works and medicine that doesn't.\\"(p. 6) One of Offit's concerns is the scare tactics he says proponents of Alternative Medicine will often use, in a 2010 podcast with the Point of Inquiry Offit stated \\"it is very difficult to unscare people when you scare them.\\" Offit has said that the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act of 1994 should be overturned to provide proper oversight and action against supplement providers. DDT Offit has blamed Rachel Carson for millions of deaths from malaria because of her campaign against DDT.Paul A. Offit, Millions Died Thanks to the Mother of Environmentalism‚ÄîCarson made a critical mistake and a lot of people died as a result, Foundation for Economic Education, 17 June 2017. Reception At CSICon 2018 Offit is a recipient of numerous awards, including the J. Edmund Bradley Prize for Excellence in Pediatrics from the University of Maryland Medical School, the Young Investigator Award in Vaccine Development from the Infectious Diseases Society of America, the 2013 Maxwell Finland Award for Scientific Achievement and a Research Career Development Award from the National Institutes of Health. In 2018, Offit was awarded the Albert B. Sabin Gold Medal from the Sabin Vaccine Institute in Washington, DC for his work on the oral rotavirus vaccine and his leadership in promoting immunization. In 2011 Offit was honored by the Biotechnology Industry Organization with the 2011 Biotech Humanitarian Award. Offit donated the award's $10,000 prize to the Vaccine Education Center at The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia. Also in 2011, Offit was elected to the Institute of Medicine at the group's annual meeting. In 2013 Offit was presented with the Robert B. Balles Prize in Critical Thinking by the Committee for Skeptical Inquiry (CSI) for Do You Believe in Magic? The Sense and Nonsense of Alternative Medicine. \\"Offit is a literal lifesaver... educates the public about the dangers of alternative medicine, may save many, many more.\\" Michael Specter wrote that Offit \\"has become a figure of hatred to the many vaccine denialists and conspiracy theorists.\\" Specter reported that Offit had often been threatened with violence by anti-vaccine advocates, necessitating precautions such as screening Offit's packages for mail bombs and providing guards when Offit attends federal health advisory committee meetings. At a 2008 vaccine activism rally in Washington, D.C., environmental lawyer Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. criticized Offit's ties to drug companies, calling him a \\"poster child for the term 'biostitute'.\\" Offit lecture on \\"Opioids\\" at CSICon 2016 Also in 2008, Sharyl Attkisson published an article for CBS News questioning Offit's independence, citing his financial ties to vaccine manufacturers. Offit said he is upfront about the money and that it doesn't affect his decisions. Curt Linderman Sr., the editor of the Autism File blog, wrote online that it would \\"be nice\\" if Offit \\"was dead\\". Such criticism has provoked statements in Offit's defense. Peter Hotez, a professor and vaccine researcher at George Washington University, has been quoted in a Newsweek article: : Peter Hotez ... says government health officials should take a bolder stand in reassuring the public. Hotez feels as strongly as Offit does about the science (saying vaccines cause autism, he says, \\"is like saying the world is flat\\"), but, like other busy scientists, he's less willing to enter the fray. \\"Here's someone who has created an invention that saves hundreds of lives every day,\\" says Hotez, whose daughter, 15, has autism, \\"and he's vilified as someone who hates children. It's just so unfair.\\" Publications Offit has written or co- written several books on vaccines, vaccination and the public, and antibiotics, as well as dozens of scholarly articles on the topic. Isabelle Rapin, a neurology professor at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine, wrote in Neurology Today about Autism's False Prophets: : This book explores why parents, seeking in vain for a cure and for an explanation of their child's problem, are so vulnerable to false hopes and to the nasty predators who have from time immemorial always taken advantage of the desperate in our society. ... [Offit] became outraged by Dr. Andrew Wakefield's 1998 study in the Lancet that blamed the measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine for causing autism. Dr. Offit predicted the paper would precipitate a resurgence of measles and its serious complications, and even deaths ‚Äì a prophecy soon realized. In \\"The Cutter Incident\\" (see Cutter Laboratories incident), Offit describes fallout relating to an early poliovirus vaccine tragedy that had the effect of deterring production of already licensed vaccines and discouraging the development of new ones. Offit advocates for the repeal of religious exemptions to vaccine requirements, saying that such exemptions amount to medical neglect.

Orange County Council, 17 Cal.4th 736, 952 P.2d 261, 72 Cal.Rptr.2d 453 (1998), was a case before the Supreme Court of California that established that groups such as the Boy Scouts of America are not considered \\"business establishments\\" as used in the state's Unruh Civil Rights Act and could not be subject to its provisions. Its companion case was Curran v. Mount Diablo Council of the Boy Scouts of America, 17 Cal.4th 670, 952 P.2d 218, 72 Cal.Rptr.2d 410 (1998).  Background  Twin brothers Michael and William Randall were Cub Scouts, a membership division of the Boy Scouts of America (BSA), in Anaheim Hills with Den 4, Pack 519 of the Orange County Council. They were on their way to earning the Bear Badge which included, in one of its four advancement areas, a religious component that asserted the existence of God and required the practice of one's faith as \\"taught in your home, church, synagogue, mosque, or religious fellowship,\\" as well as a pledge asserting their duty to God which was included in the opinion of the court: > We are lucky the people who wrote and signed our constitution were very > wise. They understood the need of Americans to worship God as they choose. A > member of your family will be able to talk with you about your duty to God. > Remember, this achievement is part of your Cub Scout promise. \\"I, ____, > promise to do my best to do my duty to God and my country.\\" The Randalls stated at their local Cub Scout den meeting that they had a conflict with the religious requirement. The den leader asserted to the children's mother that the requirement was necessary to proceed through the ranks. The Orange County Council agreed with this position. While initially the Orange County Council allowed the Randalls to continue to participate in Scouting activities, it refused to allow them to advance in the ranks until they asserted their duty to God. The mother, as guardian ad litem, filed suit against the Orange County Council, alleging that the Council reversed its initial decision and expelled the Randalls from the Boy Scouts.  The case  The Superior Court for the County of Orange ruled at the initial trial that the BSA was considered a \\"business establishment\\" under the terms of California's Unruh Civil Rights Act because of the preponderance of the defendants evidence that illustrated the BSA's extensive real estate holdings, revenue-generating interests, and commercial enterprises. The court ordered statutory damages of $250 awarded to the plaintiffs and a \\"permanent injunction against [the BSA], preventing it from excluding [the Randalls] from membership or advancement in the organization or in a den, pack, troop, or post based upon [the BSA's] religious beliefs or lack thereof, their refusal to swear an oath or a duty to God, or to use the word \\"God\\" in any pledge, oath, or promise or vow, or their failure to participate in any religious activities.\\" The BSA appealed the decision to the California Court of Appeal which upheld the core of the decision (that the BSA was subject to the Unruh Civil Rights Act) based on the court's earlier decision in Curran, 147 Cal.App.3d 712 (1986), but reversed the injunction. The Supreme Court of California granted review. In a 7-0 ruling, the Supreme Court overturned the rulings of the lower court based on their decision in Curran, 17 Cal. 4th 670, that the BSA did not qualify under the Unruh Civil Rights Act as the court found it to be a \\"charitable organization\\" with interests unrelated to the economic benefit of its members, and that it did not have a commercial interest in the activities provided to its members. As a sidebar, the Randalls reached the rank of Eagle Scout before being expelled from the BSA as a result of court prohibiting further actions by the BSA regarding their expulsion until the case was resolved.

Sakellarakis, (1991) Crete Archanes (guidebook) The discovery of ancient roads leading from Archanes to Juktas, Anemospilia, Xeri Kara and Vathypetro indicate that Archanes was an important hub in the region during Minoan times. Archaeological evidence indicates that ancient Archanes spread out over the same area as the modern town of Archanes. Archaeology In 1912, Xanthoudides noted the importance of Archanes, but Sir Arthur Evans was the first to characterize the site as palatial, declaring that Archanes was likely a Summer Palace for the Knossos kings. Spyridon Marinatos and N. Platon excavated minor areas in the region, but nothing supported Evans' theory. In 1964, Yannis Sakellarakis dug trial trenches at the Tourkoyeitonia site and uncovered the first evidence of a palace site. Since 1966, Archanes has been excavated by the Greek Archaeological Society under the supervision of John Sakellarakis and Efi Sapouna-Sakellarakis. In the Minoan era, aqueducts delivered water to Kephala Hill from spring water sources at Archanes, which are also the source of the Kairatos River.C. Michael Hogan, Knossos fieldnotes, Modern Antiquarian (2007) Troullos is the easternmost site of the Archanes settlement. Tourkoyeitonia, in central Archanes, is the site of its palace, likely built in the Middle Minoan period. Excavations began here in 1964 by J. Sakellarakis. It contains features such as ashlar blocks, poros- stone plaques and blocks, plaster, wood, stucco floor tiles, gypsum, kouskoura slabs, mud bricks, ironstone blocks, schist plaques, blue marble flooring, incurved concave altars, wooden columns and pillars, frescoes and Polytheron doorways. A variety of Porphyrite stone lamps, vases, amphorae, cooking pots, cups, lamps, tools and every-day domestic items such as tweezers have been unearthed at the site. Southwest of Tourkoyeitonia, more of the palace is found. While little remains of the architecture, the walls that are preserved are Middle Minoan III-Late Minoan IA. Linear A tablets and the model of a house were excavated at The Archive along with MMIII-LMIA pottery and several unworked pieces of rock crystal, obsidian and steatite. left The man-made enclosure of a spring, partially excavated in 1921 by Sir Arthur Evans, was completed by J. Sakellarakis in 1964. The floor is laid with pebbles, and the walls are poros-stone. Evidence indicates that it was built between Middle Minoan IB and Middle Minoan IIIA, destroyed during Late Minoan IA, and then restored and in various use afterward. The reservoir is within the palace grounds. A large paved area, dissected by walkways that form a triangle, is found in Theatre Area\\" or \\"Aghios Nikolaos\\" (Saint Nicholas). Two stepped altars are found here, one on a walkway and one on the pavement. There is a painting of a reconstruction of this area in Sakellarakis' Crete Archanes guidebook on page 49, which does this area more justice than a written description. Economy Street in Archanes Street in Archanes Archanes overlook, Mount. Juktas in the background The economy revolves around grape and olive processing and marketing. Both products account for some 96% of its total agricultural products. The Agricultural Cooperative of Archanes, set up in 1931, is one of the oldest in Greece, and consists of 1119 members. A quarter of the wine production is exported to Germany, France and the Netherlands, and the rest of the production is largely marketed domestically. Since the late 1990s, attempts have been made to convert part of wine making step by step to organic and integrated farming, beginning with the cultivation of table grapes.

Definitions In knot theory, a \\"knot\\" means an embedded circle in the 3-sphere :S^3 = {\\\\mathbf{x}\\\\in \\\\mathbb{R}^4 \\\\mid \\\\mathbf{x}=1 }. The 3-sphere can be thought of as the boundary of the four-dimensional ball :B^4 = {\\\\mathbf{x}\\\\in \\\\mathbb{R}^4 \\\\mid \\\\mathbf{x}\\\\leq 1 }. A knot K\\\\subset S^3 is slice if it bounds a nicely embedded 2-dimensional disk D in the 4-ball.. What is meant by \\"nicely embedded\\" depends on the context: if D is smoothly embedded in B4, then K is said to be smoothly slice. If D is only locally flat (which is weaker), then K is said to be topologically slice. Examples The following is a list of all non-trivial slice knots with 10 or fewer crossings; 61, 8_8, 8_9, 8_{20}, 9_{27}, 9_{41}, 9_{46}, 10_3, 10_{22}, 10_{35}, 10_{42}, 10_{48}, 10_{75}, 10_{87}, 10_{99}, 10_{123}, 10_{129}, 10_{137}, 10_{140}, 10_{153} and 10_{155}. All of them are smoothly slice. Properties Every ribbon knot is smoothly slice. An old question of Fox asks whether every smoothly slice knot is actually a ribbon knot.. The signature of a slice knot is zero. The Alexander polynomial of a slice knot factors as a product f(t)f(t^{-1}) where f(t) is some integral Laurent polynomial., p. 90.

The MetroStars were purchased by the Austrian beverage company Red Bull on March 9, 2006 and were rebranded as the New York Red Bulls. The club continues to exist under its new RagingBullNation name. RagingBullNation encourages its members to become the \\"12th man\\" for the Red Bulls by leading creative chants and encouraging players on the field. RagingBullNation's section at Giants Stadium on gameday was 115 in the lower bowl. This section is referred to as \\"Citizens Corner\\" or \\"The Corral\\" as it is positioned in the corner by one goal. Raging Bull Nation was not granted a sideline supporters section when the team moved to Red Bull Arena in 2010 and disbanded. Many of Raging Bull Nation's members united with numerous ex-Empire Supporters Club members to form a new group known as the Viking Army Supporters Club. Charitable activities In its first year of existence, MetroNation raised $1015 in donations for the Leukemia & Lymphoma Society. MetroNation also raised funds for victims of Hurricane Katrina.

Group culture RagingBullNation is known for their \\"RoadSide Roundup\\" (formerly \\"MetroGate\\") game day tailgate parties, located in parking lot 15 outside the South Tower entrance of Giants Stadium. On the occasion of USA international matches being scheduled on the same day as Red Bulls matches, Raging Bull Nation has organized watch parties in the parking lot using portable satellite equipment. Raging Bull Nation organizes its away game road trips to D.C. United and New England Revolution in coordination with other Red Bulls supporters clubs, such as Empire Supporters Club and First Row Idiots. Raging Bull Nation has an official theme song written by Mike Apple. On Red Bulls home opening day 2006, Raging Bull Nation unveiled its tribute entitled ‚ÄúFrom the Stars and Stripes to the Red and Black.‚Äù It will be a tribute to the MetroStars who played in the 1994 FIFA World Cup and it will be kept at the Pride and Passion Pub at Giants Stadium until its move to the new stadium pub at Red Bull Arena. The players honored include Hall of Famer Tab Ramos and future Hall of Famers Tony Meola and Alexi Lalas.

It was first opened in 1892, branching from the Orbost line at Dandenong, and extending to Port Albert. Much of it (the section up to Leongatha) remained in use until July 1993. Today, only the section between Dandenong and Cranbourne remains open for use. The section of the line from Nyora to Leongatha was used by the South Gippsland Tourist Railway until it ceased operations in 2016. The section from Leongatha to Toora, and a portion of the former line at Koo Wee Rup, have been converted into the Great Southern Rail Trail. History The Melbourne and Suburban Railway Company opened a line from Princes Bridge railway station to Punt Road (Richmond) and South Yarra in 1859 and extended to Dandenong in 1879. The South Gippsland railway line was opened from Dandenong to Cranbourne in 1888 and extended to Koo Wee Rup, Nyora and Loch in 1890, Korumburra and Leongatha in 1891 and Welshpool, Alberton and Port Albert in 1892. The section from Alberton to Port Albert was closed in the 1940s. A branch line was built from Alberton to Yarram and Woodside in 1921. The line was well known for its sharp curves and spectacular scenery and was also one of the last lines to offer a 'Mixed Passenger and Goods' service in Victoria. The section from Yarram to Woodside was closed on 26 May 1953, with the section from Welshpool to Yarram closed on 26 October 1987 when the superphosphate freight services ceased. From this point until 30 June 1992, the track beyond Agnes, referred to as Barry Beach Junction received minimal usage, although a short branch leading from Agnes to Barry Beach was used extensively for goods traffic to serve the oil platforms in Bass Strait. After the withdrawal of this freight service the railway line beyond Leongatha was booked out of use for all rail traffic. This section of track was then dismantled in 1994, in which required the strengthening of the line's derelict trestle bridges in order to allow the track removal machine to dismantle the tracks.\\"Disappearing Tracks\\". Newsrail (Australian Railway Historical Society (Victorian Division)): pages 101-106. April 1995 On 24 July 1993, the last regular V/Line passenger train operated to Leongatha with P Class diesel locomotive number 18 hauling the return passenger train with a set of 4 H-Set carriages. Following the withdrawal of all rail service beyond Koala Siding, the section of track from Nyora to Leongatha was transferred to the South Gippsland Railway in 1994, The South Gippsland Railway was founded in 1990 as the \\"Great Southern Railway Society\\", based at Nyora, with the intention of preserving the line in case of closure. On 15 January 1998, all regular V/Line services ceased on the line after the withdrawal of the Australian Glass Manufacturing sand train, that operated between the sand mine at Koala Siding, situated between Lang Lang and Nyora railway stations, and the AGM siding at Spotswood. Since April 1998, no trains have operated beyond Cranbourne. Branch lines A 5 km-long narrow-gauge horse-drawn tramway was opened from Welshpool to Welshpool Jetty in 1905. It was closed in 1941. The mountainous Strzelecki branch line, which opened in 1922, was built from Koo Wee Rup to Strzelecki. The line was closed in stages throughout the 1930s, '40s and '50s. The Wonthaggi branch line was built from Nyora to Wonthaggi, opening in 1910, to serve the State Coal Mine, a small extension to the line was opened in 1917. The Wonthaggi line was closed in 1978. The Outtrim branch line was built from Korumburra to the coal mine at Outtrim in two stages: the initial stage to Jumbunna was opened in 1894, with the final section to Outtrim opening in 1896. The line was closed in two stages: the first from Jumbunna to Outtrim on 4 September 1951 and then from Jumbunna to Korumburra on 1 October 1953. Services Passenger services operated on the line from its opening. Services from Melbourne to Leongatha and Yarram were withdrawn on 6 June 1981, with replacement buses starting three days later. The Yarram train was a loco hauled train, while the Leongatha train was a DRC railcar hauling MTH carriages. To fill the gaps between those services, local trains were introduced on a three-month trial from Dandenong to Lang Lang, but were withdrawn on 3 October 1981, due to insufficient patronage. Services to Leongatha were restored on 9 December 1984, and free train shuttles to Korumburra were provided to mark the occasion. The 1984 timetable included two round trips per day from Monday to Saturday, and one round trip on Sundays. However, the services were again withdrawn on 24 July 1993. With the withdrawal of freight services from Koala siding in January 1998, the line became unused beyond Cranbourne. The exception was a tourist operation, which commenced operation between Nyora and Leongatha. It later became known as South Gippsland Railway. In 1995 the section between Dandenong and Cranbourne was electrified and a station added at Merinda Park, as part of a $27 million Federal Government-funded project. The Barry Beach freight service ceased in 1992. The line beyond Leongatha was booked out of service on 30 June 1992, effectively ending all traffic on the line beyond Leongatha. V/Line passenger services ceased to Leongatha on 24 July 1993, after last train to Melbourne. By the mid-1990s only T, Y and P class diesel locomotives were used on the line, due to their low axle loads, with a 15 km/h speed limit applying to parts of the track. This continued until 15 January 1998, when the Koala Siding (near Nyora) to Spotswood sand train ceased operation. On average, it took a passenger train 2 hours and 15 minutes to travel from Spencer Street station to Leongatha during the final 10 years of service, with the replacement bus service completing the journey in an average time of 2 hours and 30 minutes. Steamrail, railfan enthusiasts trains A number of special railway enthusiast services were operated along the line during the 1980s and 1990s, given that the line was near closure. Notable special journeys included K.153 hauling the last steam special to Yarram on 24 October 1987, as well as an earlier Vintage Train journey to Foster and return on 6 September 1987.\\"Vintage Train To Foster\\". Newsrail (Australian Railway Historical Society (Victorian Division)): pp. 346-347. November 1987. The last steam hauled train to run beyond Leongatha was on 13 November 1988, when steam locomotives D3.639 and K.153 travelled to Foster. That was the last time the locomotive turntable at Foster would be available for usage prior to its relocation to Korumburra railway station for the South Gippsland Tourist Railway in 1994.

D.E.R.M. 58 ran the last advertised special train available to the public beyond Leongatha to Welshpool and Barry Beach on May the 12th 1990. During the 1990s, steam tours only operated as far as Leongatha, with the first being run on 9 September 1990, again hauled by steam locomotive K.153, which coincided with the steam locomotive's 50th anniversary since being introduced into service.\\"Preservation\\".

Newsrail (Australian Railway Historical Society (Victorian Division)): pages 214‚Äì15. July 1993. On 25 July 1993, the apparent \\"Last Lament to Leongatha\\" was run, operated by K190 and K183. After the withdrawal of passenger services to Leongatha, a few more steam-hauled trips were organised before the line was booked out of regular use between Cranbourne and Nyora. On 17 April 1994, K190 and K183 again travelled to Leongatha with the \\"South Gippsland Rambler\\", with a consist of seven wooden carriages.\\"Operations, South East - Korumburra\\".

K190 and T345 were detached at Nyora station. Shortly afterwards K183 journeyed solo to Leongatha. K190 followed to Leongatha with a consist of the tourist railway's carriages. T342, T345 and the DERM RM55 combined for a Saturday tourist railway service. Later, K183 returned to Newport Workshops with the Steamrail Victoria train. However, steam locomotives D3639 and K183 combined for the last steam excursion to traverse the South Gippsland rail line on 25 September 1997. During this time D3.639, along with K190, were both on loan to the South Gippsland Tourist Railway.Geoff Peterson, \\"Dream Come True\\", Newsrail (Australian Railway Historical Society (Victorian Division)): page 307. October 1996. Current status The track beyond Leongatha, to Yarram and the Barry Beach branch line, was dismantled in 1994, but removal of other infrastructure, such as level crossing signals, took place around mid to late 1992, soon after the last train ran to Barry Beach. The section between Leongatha and Foster was turned into the Great Southern Rail Trail in 1998. In 2011, the Tarra Rail Trail from Alberton to Yarram was completed. , the section between Foster and Toora had been complete, leaving the final section from there to Alberton being converted into the Great Southern Rail Trail. The section from Dandenong to Cranbourne was electrified in 1995 and, as the Cranbourne Line, is now part of the Melbourne suburban rail network. The first level crossing on the closed section of the line, the South Gippsland Highway crossing in Cranbourne has since been paved over. The Victorian Transport Plan of 2009 stated that the Cranbourne line would be extended two kilometres to a new station at Cranbourne East by 2015. The new Cranbourne East station would be built near Renyard Street and the Casey Fields complex.The Victorian Transport Plan The line from Nyora to Leongatha was used by the South Gippsland Tourist Railway until 2016. The branch line from Nyora to Wonthaggi was closed in 1978 and dismantled by 1990. It is now the Bass Coast Rail Trail. Since its closure, a significant section of the former Wonthaggi Line has been leased or sold to farmers, while other sections have been cut away to widen highways and main roads in the coastal South Gippsland region. The former branch lines to both Outtrim and Strezlecki have become a distant memory. The remaining section of track from Cranbourne to Nyora is disused but mostly still intact. A length of track was pulled up at Koo Wee Rup in 2009 to allow the construction of toilets for the bus and coach stop. Construction of the pipeline for Wonthaggi Desalination Plant made it necessary to remove three sections of the line. The first is about 100 metres on the down side of Monomeith Road, where about 50 metres of track were removed. The second is on the up side of Caldermeade Road, where about thirty metres of track were removed, and the third is about halfway between Caldermeade and Lang Lang stations. Much of the operational and safeworking infrastructure remains in place in this section, including signalling equipment, level crossings, and easements. Station platforms are also in place, but mostly without station buildings, for example at Lang Lang, Koo-Wee-Rup, and Tooradin. Parts of the track have warped due to erosion, ground movement or the displacement of sleepers. This is especially evident near Lang Lang, Tooradin, and north of Koo-Wee-Rup. There are also questions about the integrity of some bridges and culverts along the route. Prior to the 1999 Victorian election, the state Labor Party promised to return passenger services to Leongatha. In 2008, a report commissioned by the Victorian Department of Transport found the cost of returning passenger services to Leongatha to be unjustifiably high, estimating the cost at $72 million. The report stated that only 20 per cent of respondents surveyed about their transport needs considered restoring train services to be the main priority. Instead $14.7 million was allocated to road coach service upgrades. Communication from Minister Lynne Kosky, 3 June 2008. The then Minister for Public Transport Lynne Kosky said that the State Government had provided funding for development of a rail trail between Cranbourne East and Nyora to support tourism in South Gippsland in May 2008. On February 24, 2016 South Gippsland Shire Council unanimously carried motions to support the return of rail services to Leongatha on the back of a petition initiated by the South & West Gippsland Transport Group, which attracted 2,420 supporters. The successful motion means that the data gathered from the petition and documents prepared by South Gippsland Shire Council investigating the returning rail to South Gippsland have now been passed onto Public Transport Victoria with a call to provide for South Gippsland rail services in the forthcoming Regional Network Development Plan. After the disbandment of the South Gippsland Tourist Railway on January 16, 2016 it had also been announced that VicTrack will continue to leave the disused rail line between Cranbourne and Leongatha intact and available for future use by freight and passenger trains.Public Transport Users Association News March 2016 Volume 40 No.1 Page 3 'Council push for Leongatha trains to return' Political context Reopening the South Gippsland railway line as far as Leongatha continues to be a prominent issue in the region.http://www.abc.net.au/news/2015-07-13/forums-hears-calls- for-improved-regional-public-transport/6614812 A South Gippsland Shire Council Priority Projects document, released in June 2013, acknowledged that the return of a rail service was a major community priority, with funding and support sought from all levels of government.http://www.southgippsland.vic.gov.au/Files/PRIORITY_PROJECTS_2013.pdf In early 2014, a report into possible extensions of the Melbourne metropolitan rail system identified the population growth corridor from Cranbourne to Koo- Wee-Rup, along the disused Leongatha line, as a key planning priority. The South and West Gippsland Transport Group, a public transport and rail lobby group, established in April 2011, which is closely associated with the South Gippsland Shire Council and other local government bodies, has campaigned for an integrated transport plan in the region, which includes rail at the forefront of the proposal. The group had been known as the South Gippsland Transport Users Group and had amalgamated with numerous rail lobby groups in 1994 shortly after the rail passenger service to Leongatha was withdrawn in July 1993. One notable milestone for the group was running a successful campaign that saw passenger rail services reinstated to Leongatha on December 9, 1984.http://www.ptua.org.au/files/newsletters/1980s/PTUA-news-198501.pdf Despite the promise to revive the railway line for freight and passenger services by the Bracks Labor government in 1999 being abandoned by his successor John Brumby in 2008, a community campaign involving the South and West Gippsland Transport Group continued to lobby, in collaboration with key stakeholders and governments, to achieve the reinstatement of rail services, and the improvement of transport accessibility in the region.

The Modern English term militia dates to the year 1590, with the original meaning now obsolete: \\"the body of soldiers in the service of a sovereign or a state\\". Subsequently, since approximately 1665, militia has taken the meaning \\"a military force raised from the civilian population of a country or region, especially to supplement a regular army in an emergency, frequently as distinguished from mercenaries or professional soldiers\\".Oxford English Dictionary, Draft Revision March 2002. The U.S. Supreme Court adopted the following definition for \\"active militia\\" from an Illinois Supreme Court case of 1879: \\" 'a body of citizens trained to military duty, who may be called out in certain cases, but may not be kept on service like standing armies, in times of peace'. . . when not engaged at stated periods . . . they return to their usual avocations . . . and are subject to call when public exigencies demand it.\\"Perpich v.

French and Indian War (1754‚Äì1763) See article: Provincial troops in the French and Indian Wars Braddock's defeat, 1755 During the French and Indian Wars, town militia formed a recruiting pool for the Provincial Forces. The legislature of the colony would authorize a certain force level for the season's campaign and set recruitment quotas for each local militia. In theory, militia members could be drafted by lot if there were inadequate forces for the Provincial Regulars; however, the draft was rarely resorted to because provincial regulars were highly paid (more highly paid than their regular British Army counterparts) and rarely engaged in combat. In September 1755, George Washington, then adjutant-general of the Virginia militia, upon a frustrating and futile attempt to call up the militia to respond to a frontier Indian attack:Sparks, Jared: \\"The Life of George Washington\\", page 70.

See New Hampshire Provincial Regiment for a history of a Provincial unit during the French and Indian War. Pre-American Revolutionary War era (1763‚Äì1775) Just prior to the American Revolutionary War, on October 26, 1774, the Massachusetts Provincial Congress, observing the British military buildup, deemed their militia resources to be insufficient: the troop strength, \\"including the sick and absent, amounted to about seventeen thousand men ... this was far short of the number wanted, that the council recommended an immediate application to the New England governments to make up the deficiency\\":Sparks, Jared: \\"The Life of George Washington\\", page 134-135.

Blue coated militiamen in the foreground flee from the volley of gunshots from the red coated British Army line in the background with dead and wounded militiamen on the ground. The American Revolutionary War began near Boston, Massachusetts with the Battles of Lexington and Concord, in which a group of local militias constituted the American side (the \\"Patriots\\"). On April 19, 1775, a British force 800 strong marched out of Boston to Concord intending to destroy patriot arms and ammunition. At 5:00 in the morning at Lexington, they met about 70 armed militiamen whom they ordered to disperse, but the militiamen refused. Firing ensued; it is not clear which side opened fire. This became known as \\"the shot heard round the world\\". Eight militiamen were killed and ten wounded, whereupon the remainder took flight. The British continued on to Concord and were unable to find most of the arms and ammunition of the patriots. As the British marched back toward Boston, patriot militiamen assembled along the route, taking cover behind stone walls, and sniped at the British. At Meriam's Corner in Concord, the British columns had to close in to cross a narrow bridge, exposing themselves to concentrated, deadly fire. The British retreat became a rout. It was only with the help of an additional detachment of 900 troops that the British force managed to return to Boston.Shepherd, William (1834). A History of the American Revolution Page 67. London, England. Published I.N. Whiting This marked the beginning of the war. It was \\"three days after the affair of Lexington and Concord that any movement was made towards embodying a regular army\\".Sparks, Jared: The Life of George Washington, page 135. F. Andrews, 1853. In 1777, the Second Continental Congress adopted the Articles of Confederation, which contained a provision for raising a confederal militia that consent would be required from nine of the 13 States. Article VI of the Articles of Confederation states, > ... every State shall always keep up a well-regulated and disciplined > militia, sufficiently armed and accoutered, and shall provide and constantly > have ready for use, in public stores, a due number of field pieces and > tents, and a proper quantity of arms, ammunition and camp equipage. Some militia units appeared without adequate arms, as evidenced in this letter from John Adams to his wife, dated August 26, 1777: > The militia are turning out with great alacrity both in Maryland and > Pennsylvania. They are distressed for want of arms. Many have none, we shall > rake and scrape enough to do Howe's business, by favor of the Heaven.Adams, > John: Letters of John Adams, Addressed to His Wife, page 257. C.C. Little > and J. Brown, 1841. The initial enthusiasm of Patriot militiamen in the beginning days of the war soon waned. The historian Garry Wills explains, > The fervor of the early days in the reorganized militias wore off in the > long grind of an eight-year war. Now the right to elect their own officers > was used to demand that the men not serve away from their state. Men evaded > service, bought substitutes to go for them as in the old days, and had to be > bribed with higher and higher bounties to join the effort ‚Äì which is why > Jefferson and Samuel Adams called them so expensive.

This practice was common enough to have its own > technical term ‚Äì \\"bounty jumping\\".Wills, Garry (1999). A Necessary Evil: A > History of American Distrust of Government, Page 35. New York, NY; Simon & > Schuster The burden of waging war passed to a large extent to the standing army, the Continental Army. The stay-at-home militia tended then to perform the important role of the internal police to keep order. British forces sought to disrupt American communities by instigating slave rebellions and Indian raids. The militia fended off these threats. Militias also spied on Loyalists in the American communities. In Albany County, New York, the militia established a Committee for Detecting and Defeating Conspiracies to look out for and investigate people with suspicious allegiances. (rebuttal of Wills book ‚Äì page 16.) Confederation period (1783‚Äì1787) Politically, the militia was highly popular during the postwar period, though to some extent, based more on pride of victory in the recent war than on the realities. This skepticism of the actual value of relying upon the militia for national defense, versus a trained regular army was expressed by Gouverneur Morris: > An overweening vanity leads the fond many, each man against the conviction > of his own heart, to believe or affect to believe, that militia can beat > veteran troops in the open field and even play of battle. This idle notion, > fed by vaunting demagogues, alarmed us for our country, when in the course > of that time and chance, which happen to all, she should be at war with a > great power.Sparks, Jared: The Life of Gouverneur Morris, with Selections > from His Correspondence and Miscellaneous Papers. Boston, 1832. Robert Spitzer, citing Daniel Boorstin, describes this political dichotomy of the public popularity of the militia versus the military value: > While the reliance upon militias was politically satisfying, it proved to be > an administrative and military nightmare. State detachments could not be > easily combined into larger fighting units; soldiers could not be relied on > to serve for extended periods, and desertions were common; officers were > elected, based on popularity rather than experience or training; discipline > and uniformity were almost nonexistent. General George Washington defended the militia in public, but in correspondence with Congress expressed his opinion of the militia quite to the contrary: > To place any dependence on the Militia, is, assuredly, resting upon a broken > staff. Men just dragged from the tender Scenes of domestic life; > unaccustomed to the din of Arms; totally unacquainted with every kind of > military skill, which being followed by a want of confidence in themselves, > when opposed to Troops regularly trained, disciplined, and appointed, > superior in knowledge and superior in Arms, makes them timid, and ready to > fly from their own shadows ... if I was called upon to declare upon Oath, > whether the Militia have been most serviceable or hurtful upon the whole, I > should subscribe to the latter.Weatherup, Roy G.: Standing Armies and the > Armed Citizens: An Historical Analysis of the Second Amendment. Hastings > Constitutional Law Quarterly (Fall 1975), 973 In Shays' Rebellion, a Massachusetts militia that had been raised as a private army defeated the main Shays site force on February 3, 1787. There was a lack of an institutional response to the uprising, which energized calls to reevaluate the Articles of Confederation and gave strong impetus to the Constitutional Convention which began in May 1787. At the end of the Revolutionary War, a political atmosphere developed at the local level where the militia was seen with fondness, despite their spotty record on the battlefield. Typically, when the militia did act well was when the battle came into the locale of the militia, and local inhabitants tended to exaggerate the performance of the local militia versus the performance of the Continental Army. The Continental Army was seen as the protector of the States, though it also was viewed as a dominating force over the local communities. Joseph Reed, president of Pennsylvania viewed this jealousy between the militia forces and the standing army as similar to the prior frictions between the militia and the British Regular Army a generation before during the French and Indian War. Tensions came to a head at the end of the war when the Continental Army officers demanded pensions and set up the Society of the Cincinnati to honor their own wartime deeds. The local communities did not want to pay national taxes to cover the Army pensions, when the local militiamen received none.Wills, Garry (1999). A Necessary Evil: A History of American Distrust of Government, Page 37-38. New York, NY; Simon & Schuster Constitution and Bill of Rights (1787‚Äì1789) The delegates of the Constitutional Convention (the founding fathers/framers of the United States Constitution) under Article 1; section 8, clauses 15 and 16 of the federal constitution, granted Congress the power to \\"provide for organizing, arming, and disciplining the Militia\\", as well as, and in distinction to, the power to raise an army and a navy. The US Congress is granted the power to use the militia of the United States for three specific missions, as described in Article 1, section 8, clause 15: \\"To provide for the calling of the militia to execute the laws of the Union, suppress insurrections, and repel invasions.\\" The Militia Act of 1792Militia Act of 1792 clarified whom the militia consists of: =Civilian control of a peacetime army= At the time of the drafting of the Constitution, and the Bill of Rights, a political sentiment existed in the newly formed United States involving suspicion of peacetime armies not under civilian control. This political belief has been identified as stemming from the memory of the abuses of the standing army of Oliver Cromwell and King James II, in Great Britain in the prior century, which led to the Glorious Revolution and resulted in placing the standing army under the control of Parliament.Wills, Garry (1999). A Necessary Evil, A History of American Distrust of Government. New York, NY; Simon & Schuster During the Congressional debates, James Madison discussed how a militia could help defend liberty against tyranny and oppression. (Source I Annals of Congress 434, June 8, 1789) Though during his presidency, after enduring the failures of the militia in the War of 1812, Madison came to favor the maintenance of a strong standing army. =Shift from States' power to Federal power= A major concern of the various delegates during the constitutional debates over the Constitution and the Second Amendment to the Constitution revolved around the issue of transferring militia power held by the States (under the existing Articles of Confederation) to Federal control. =Political debate regarding compulsory militia service for pacifists= Records of the constitutional debate over the early drafts of the language of the Second Amendment included significant discussion of whether service in the militia should be compulsory for all able bodied men, or should there be an exemption for the \\"religiously scrupulous\\" conscientious objector. The concern about risks of a \\"religiously scrupulous\\" exemption clause within the second amendment to the Federal Constitution was expressed by Elbridge Gerry of Massachusetts (from 1 Annals of Congress at 750, 17 August 1789): The \\"religiously scrupulous\\" clause was ultimately stricken from the final draft of second amendment to the Federal Constitution though the militia clause was retained. The Supreme Court of the United States has upheld a right to conscientious objection to military service.Robert Paul Churchill, \\"Conscientious Objection\\", in Donald K. Wells, An Encyclopedia of War and Ethics. Greenwood Press 1996. (p.99- 102). =Concern over select militias= William S. Fields & David T. Hardy write: > While in The Federalist No. 46, Madison argued that a standing army of > 25,000 to 30,000 men would be offset by \\"a militia amounting to near a half > million of citizens with arms in their hands, officered by men chosen from > among themselves ...\\" [119] The Antifederalists were not persuaded by these > arguments, in part because of the degree of control over the militia given > to the national government by the proposed constitution. The fears of the > more conservative opponents centered upon the possible phasing out of the > general militia in favor of a smaller, more readily corrupted, select > militia. Proposals for such a select militia already had been advanced by > individuals such as Baron Von Steuben, Washington's Inspector General, who > proposed supplementing the general militia with a force of 21,000 men given > government- issued arms and special training. [120] An article in the > Connecticut Journal expressed the fear that the proposed constitution might > allow Congress to create such select militias: \\"[T]his looks too much like > Baron Steuben's militia, by which a standing army was meant and intended.\\" > [121] In Pennsylvania, John Smiley told the ratifying convention that > \\"Congress may give us a select militia which will in fact be a standing > army\\", and worried that, [p.34] with this force in hand, \\"the people in > general may be disarmed\\". [122] Similar concerns were raised by Richard > Henry Lee in Virginia. In his widely-read pamphlet, Letters from the Federal > Farmer to the Republican, Lee warned that liberties might be undermined by > the creation of a select militia that \\"[would] answer to all the purposes of > an army\\", and concluded that \\"the Constitution ought to secure a genuine and > guard against a select militia by providing that the militia shall always be > kept well organized, armed, and disciplined, and include, according to the > past and general usage of the states, all men capable of bearing arms. Note: In Federalist Paper 29 Hamilton argued the inability to train the whole Militia made select corps inevitable and, like Madison, paid it no concern. Federalist period (1789‚Äì1801) In 1794, a militia numbering approximately 13,000 was raised and personally led by President George Washington to quell the Whiskey Rebellion in Pennsylvania. From this experience, a major weakness of a States-based citizen militia system was found to be the lack of systematic army organization, and a lack of training for engineers and officers. George Washington repeatedly warned of these shortcomings up until his death in 1799. Two days before his death, in a letter to General Alexander Hamilton, George Washington wrote: \\"The establishment of a Military Academy upon a respectable and extensive basis has ever been considered by me as an object of primary importance to this country; and while I was in the chair of government, I omitted no proper opportunity of recommending it in my public speeches, and otherwise to the attention of the legislature.\\"Cullum, George and Wood, Eleazer:Campaigns of the War of 1812‚Äì1815, Against Great Britain: Sketched and Criticized.. J. Miller, 1879. Early republic (1801‚Äì1812) In 1802, the federal military academy at West Point was established, in part to rectify the failings of irregular training inherent in a States-based militia system. War of 1812 (1812‚Äì1815) thumbright200px Kentucky Mounted Militia riflemen at the Battle of the Thames in October 1813, riding into battle as mounted infantry. In the War of 1812, the United States militia, because of a lack of discipline and poor training, were often routed in battle on open ground by British regulars.citation needed They fared better and proved more reliable when protected behind defensive entrenchments and fixed fortifications, as was effectively shown at Plattsburgh, Baltimore, and New Orleans. Because of their overall ineffectiveness and failure during the war, militias were not adequate for the national defense. Military budgets were greatly increased at this time and a smaller, standing federal army, rather than States' militias, was deemed better for the national defense. Antebellum era (1815‚Äì1861) By the 1830s the American frontier expanded westwards, with the Indian wars in the eastern United States ending. Many states let their unorganized militia lapse in favor of volunteer militia units such as city guards who carried on in functions such as assisting local law enforcement, providing troops for ceremonies and parades or as a social club. The groups of company size were usually uniformed and armed through their own contributions. Volunteer units of sufficient size could elect their own officers and apply for a state charter under names that they themselves chose. Givens, Terryl L. & Grow, Matthew J. Parley P.

Responding to criticisms of failures of the militia, Adjutant General William Sumner wrote an analysis and rebuttal in a letter to John Adams, May 3, 1823: > The disasters of the militia may be ascribed chiefly, to two causes, of > which the failure to train the men is a principle one; but, the omission to > train the officers is as so much greater, that I think the history of its > conduct, where it has been unfortunate, will prove that its defects are > attributable, more to their want of knowledge or the best mode of applying > the force under their authority to their attainment of their object than to > all others.

Due to rising tensions between Latter-day Saints and their Missourian neighbors, in 1838, General David R. Atchison, the commander of the state militia of Northwestern Missouri, ordered Samuel Bogart to \\"prevent, if possible, any invasion of Ray County by persons in arms whatever\\".Document Containing the Correspondence, Orders &c.; in Relation to the Disturbances with the Mormons; And the Evidence Given Before the Hon. Austin A. King, Judge of the Fifth Judicial Circuit of the State of Missouri, at the Court-House in Richmond, in a Criminal Court of Inquiry, Begun November 12, 1838, on the Trial of Joseph Smith, Jr., and Others, for High Treason and Other Crimes Against the State. Fayette, Missouri, 1841, complete text. Bogart, who had participated in former anti-Mormon vigilante groups, proceeded to disarm resident Latter-day Saints and forced them to leave the county. In response David W. Patten led the Caldwell County militia to rescue Latter-day Saint residents from what they believed was a \\"mob\\". The confrontation between these two county militias (Ray and Caldwell) became known as the Battle of Crooked River and is a primary cause for Governor Lilburn Boggs issuing Missouri Executive Order 44. This order, often called the \\"Extermination Order\\", told the commander of the Missouri State Militia, General John B. Clark, that, \\"The Mormons must be treated as enemies, and must be exterminated or driven from the state if necessary for the public pease‚Äîtheir outrages are beyond description.\\"* In the following days Missouri militia killed 17 Latter-day Saints at Haun's Mill, laid siege to Far West, Missouri and jailed Latter-day Saint church leaders, including Joseph Smith.LeSueur, Stephen C., The 1838 Mormon War in Missouri, University of Missouri Press, 1990. The Mormon militia, in 1857 and 1858, fought against US federal troops in the Utah War over control of government territory. During the violent political confrontations in the Kansas Territory involving anti-slavery Free-Staters and pro-slavery \\"Border Ruffians\\" elements, the militia was called out to enforce order on several occasions, notably during the incidents referred to as the Wakarusa War. During John Brown's raid on Harpers Ferry, local militia companies from villages within a 30-mile radius of Harpers Ferry cut off Brown's escape routes and trapped Brown's men in the armory.http://www.digitalhistory.uh.edu/disp_textbook.cfm?smtID=2&psid;=3285 American Civil War At the beginning of the American Civil War, neither the North or the South was nearly well enough prepared for war, and few people imagined the demands and hardships the war would bring. Just prior to the war the total peacetime army consisted of a paltry 16,000 men. Both sides issued an immediate call to forces from the militia, followed by the immediate awareness of an acute shortage of weapons, uniforms, and trained officers. State militia regiments were of uneven quality, and none had anything resembling combat training. The typical militia drilling at the time amounted to, at best, parade-ground marching. The militia units, from local communities, had never drilled together as a larger regiment, and thus lacked the extremely important skill, critically necessary for the war style of the time, of maneuvering from a marching line into a fighting line. Yet both sides were equally unready, and rushed to prepare.Catton, Bruce (2004). The Civil War, Pages 28‚Äì29. Mariner Books. =Confederate militia= The most important: *Arkansas Militia *Missouri State Guard =Union militia= New York state militia, Civil War Company \\"E\\", 22nd N.Y. State Militia, near Harpers Ferry. Following the Confederate taking of Fort Sumter, which marked the beginning of the Civil War, President Lincoln called up 75,000 States' militiamen to retake the seized Federal property and found that the militia \\"strength was far short of what the Congressional statute provided and required\\". In the summer of 1861, military camps circled around Washington, D.C. composed of new three-year army volunteers and 90-day militia units. The generals in charge of this gathering had never handled large bodies of men before, and the men were simply inexperienced civilians with arms having little discipline and less understanding of the importance of discipline.Catton, Bruce (2004). The Civil War, Page 39. Mariner Books. In the West, Union state and territorial militias existed as active forces in defense of settlers there. California especially had many active militia companies at the beginning of the war that rose in number until the end of the war. It would also provide the most Volunteers from west of the Rocky Mountains: eight regiments and two battalions of infantry, two regiments and a battalion of cavalry. It also provided most of the men for the infantry regiment from Washington Territory. Oregon raised an infantry and a cavalry regiment. Colorado Territory militias were organized both to resist the Confederacy and any civil disorder caused by secessionists, Copperheads, Mormons, or most particularly the Native tribes. The Colorado Volunteers participated in the Battle of Glorieta Pass turning back a Confederate invasion of New Mexico Territory. Later they initiated the Colorado War with the Plains Indians and committed the Sand Creek massacre. The California Volunteers of the California Column were sent east across the southern deserts to drive the Confederates out of southern Arizona, New Mexico and west Texas around El Paso, then fought the Navajo and Apache until 1866. They also were sent to guard the Overland Trail, keep the Mormons under observation by the establishment of Fort Douglas in Salt Lake City, and fought a campaign against the Shoshone culminating in the Battle of Bear River. In Nevada, Oregon and Idaho Territory, California, Oregon and Washington Territorial Volunteers tried to protect the settlers and pacified tribes from each other and they fought the Goshute, Paiute, Ute and hostile Snake Indians in the Snake War from 1864 until 1866. In California, volunteer forces fought the Bald Hills War in the northwestern forests until 1864 and also the Owens Valley Indian War in 1862‚Äì1863. Reconstruction era With passage of federal reconstruction laws between 1866 and 1870 the U.S. Army took control of the former rebel states and ordered elections to be held. These elections were the first in which African Americans could vote. Each state (except Virginia) elected Republican governments, which organized militia units.Singletary, Otis (1957). Negro militia and Reconstruction. Austin: University of Texas Press. The majority of militiamen were black.Dickerson, Donna Lee: The Reconstruction Era: Primary Documents on Events from 1865 to 1877 Page 371. Greenwood Press 2003. Racial tension and conflict, sometimes intense, existed between the Negro freedmen and the ex-Confederate whites. In parts of the South, white paramilitary groups and rifle clubs formed to counter this black militia, despite the laws prohibiting drilling, organizing, or parading except for duly authorized militia. These groups engaged in a prolonged series of retaliatory, vengeful, and hostile acts against this black militia.Dickerson, Donna Lee: The Reconstruction Era: Primary Documents on Events from 1865 to 1877 Page 372.

The activity of the official black militia, and the unofficial illegal white rifle clubs, typically peaked in the autumn surrounding elections.

Outright war between the state militia and the white rifle clubs was avoided only by the complete surrender of one of the belligerents, though tensions escalated in the following months leading to a December riot in Vicksburg, Mississippi resulting in the deaths of two whites and thirty-five black people. Reaction to this riot was mixed, with the local Democrats upset at the influx of federal troops that followed, and the Northern press expressing outrage: \\"Once more, as always, it is the Negroes that are slaughtered while the whites escape.\\"Singletary, Otis (1957). Negro militia and Reconstruction, page 85. Austin: University of Texas Press. Posse Comitatus Act Following the Reconstruction Era, Congress passed the 1878 Posse Comitatus Act intended to prohibit federal troops and federal-controlled militia from supervising elections. This act substantially limits the powers of the Federal government to use the military serving on active duty under Title 10 for law enforcement, but does not preclude governors from using their National Guard in a law enforcement role as long as the guardsmen are serving under Title 32 or on state active duty. Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War Despite a lack of initial readiness, training, and supplies, the Militas of the United States fought and achieved victory in the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War. books.google.com Ludlow massacre Militia at Ludlow, 1914 In 1914, in Ludlow, Colorado, the militia was called out to calm the situation during a coal mine strike, but the sympathies of the militia leaders allied with company management and resulted in the deaths of roughly 19 to 25 people. The state National Guard was originally called out, but the company was allowed to organize an additional private militia consisting of Colorado Fuel & Iron Company (CF&I;) guards in National Guard uniforms augmented by non-uniformed mine guards. The Ludlow massacre was an attack by the Colorado National Guard and Colorado Fuel & Iron Company camp guards on a tent colony of 1,200 striking coal miners and their families at Ludlow, Colorado on April 20, 1914. In retaliation for Ludlow, the miners armed themselves and attacked dozens of mines over the next ten days, destroying property and engaging in several skirmishes with the Colorado National Guard along a 40-mile front from Trinidad to Walsenburg. The entire strike would cost between 69 and 199 lives. Thomas Franklin Andrews described it as the \\"deadliest strike in the history of the United States\\". Mexican Revolution American organized and unorganized militias fought in the Mexican Revolution.

Dutton & Company, 1921 Twentieth century and current=Organized militia Each state has two mandatory forces, namely the Army National Guard and the Air National Guard. Many states also have state defense forces and a naval militia, which assist, support and augment National Guard forces. =National Guard= The National Guard (or National Guard of a State) differs from the National Guard of the United States; however, the two do go hand-in-hand. The National Guard is a militia force organized by each of the states and territories of the United States. Established under Title 10 and Title 32 of the U.S. Code, the state National Guard serves as part of the first-line defense for the United States. The state National Guard is divided up into units stationed in each of the 50 states and the U.S. territories and operates under their respective state governor or territorial government. The National Guard may be called up for active duty by the state governors or territorial commanding generals to help respond to domestic emergencies and disasters, such as those caused by hurricanes, floods, and earthquakes. The National Guard of the United States is a military reserve force composed of state National Guard members or units under federally recognized active or inactive armed force service for the United States. Created by the 1933 amendments to the National Defense Act of 1916, the National Guard of the United States is a joint reserve component of the United States Army and the United States Air Force. The National Guard of the United States maintains two subcomponents: the Army National Guard of the United States for the Army and the Air Force's Air National Guard of the United States. The current United States Code, Title 10 (Armed forces), section 246 (Militia: Composition and Classes), paragraph (a) states: \\"The militia of the United States consists of all able-bodied males at least 17 years of age and, except as provided in section 313 of title 32, under 45 years of age who are, or who have made a declaration of intention to become, citizens of the United States and of female citizens of the United States who are members of the National Guard.\\"See . Section 313 of Title 32 refers to persons with prior military experience. (\\"Sec. 313. Appointments and enlistments: age limitation (a) To be eligible for original enlistment in the National Guard, a person must be at least 17 years of age and under 45, or under 64 years of age and a former member of the Regular Army, Regular Navy, Regular Air Force, or Regular Marine Corps. To be eligible for reenlistment, a person must be under 64 years of age. (b) To be eligible for appointment as an officer of the National Guard, a person must ‚Äì (1) be a citizen of the United States; and (2) be at least 18 years of age and under 64.\\") These persons remain members of the militia until age 64. Paragraph (b) further states, \\"The classes of the militia are: (1) the organized militia, which consists of the National Guard and the Naval Militia; and (2) the unorganized militia, which consists of the members of the militia who are not members of the National Guard or the Naval Militia.\\"See ; The National Guard of the United States is the largest of the organized federal reserve military forces in the United States. The National Guard of the United States is classified (under title 10, United States Code (see above)) as the organized federal reserve military force. Under federal control, the National Guard of the United States can be called up for active duty by the President of the United States. Since the 2003 invasion of Iraq, many National Guard units have served overseas ‚Äì under the Total Force Policy of 1973arng.army.mil which effectively combined the National Guard with the armed forces, making them regular troops. This can lead to problems for states that also face internal emergencies while the Guard is deployed overseas. To address such issues, many of the states, such as New York and Maryland also have organized state \\"militia\\" forces or state guards which are under the control of the governor of a state; however, many of these \\"militia\\" also act as a reserve for the National Guard and are thus a part of it (this varies from state to state depending on individual state statutory laws). New York and Ohio also have active naval militias, and a few other states have on-call or proposed ones. In 1990, the United States Supreme Court ruled in the case of Perpich v. Department of Defense that the federal government has plenary power over the National Guard, greatly reducing (to the point of nonexistence) the state government's ability to withhold consent to federal deployments and training missions of the National Guard.FindLaw for Legal Professionals ‚Äì Case Law, Federal and State Resources, Forms, and Code =State defense forces= Since the Militia Act of 1903, many states have created and maintained a reserve military force known as state defense forces; some states refer to them as state military reserves or state guards. They were created to assist, support and augment National Guard forces during peacetime conditions. Also during the call up of National Guard forces for wartime deployments, state defense forces can be used to assume the full military responsibilities of the state. Their mission includes the defense of the state and the enforcement of military orders when ordered by their Governor. Throughout the 20th century, state defense forces were used in every major war. New York Guard Soldiers patrolled and secured the water aqueduct of New York, mass transit areas, and were even deployed to France to assist in logistical operations in World War I. The Texas State Guard's soldiers suppressed a riot and maintained peace and order in Texas throughout World War II. Today state defense forces continue to assist, support and augment the National Guard of the state. They provide logistical, administration, medical, transportation, security, and ceremonial assistance. Some states have provided additional support such as the New York State Defense Force (New York Guard) providing its Soldiers to help support and augment the National Guard CERFP Team. The California State Military Reserve provides the National Guard with Soldiers to assist with military police training and the Alaska State Defense Force constantly provides armed military police troops to assist with the security of Alaska. One of the major roles of the Mississippi State Guard is providing operational support during natural disasters such as hurricanes relief operations. Unorganized militia All able bodied men, 17 to 45 of age, are ultimately eligible to be called up into military service and belong to the class known as the reserve or unorganized militia (10 USC). Able bodied men who are not eligible for inclusion in the reserve militia pool are those aliens not having declared their intent to become citizens of the United States (10 USC 246) and former regular component veterans of the armed forces who have reached the age of 64 (32 USC 313). All female citizens who are members of National Guard units are also included in the reserve militia pool (). Other persons who are exempt from call to duty () and are not therefore in the reserve militia pool include: *The Vice President (also constitutionally the President of the Senate, that body which confirms the appointment of senior armed forces officers made by the Commander in Chief). *The judicial and executive officers of the United States, the several States and Territories, and Puerto Rico. *Members of the armed forces, except members who are not on active duty. *Customhouse clerks. *Persons employed by the United States in the transmission of mail. *Workmen employed in armories, arsenals, and naval shipyards of the United States. *Pilots on navigable waters. *Mariners in the sea service of a citizen of, or a merchant in, the United States. Many individual states have additional statutes describing their residents as part of the state militia; for example Washington law specifies all able-bodied citizens or intended citizens over the age of eighteen as members of the state militia, as explicitly distinct from the National Guard and Washington State Guard.Revised Code of Washington 38.04.030. Accessed via http://apps.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=38.04.030 Modern citizen- militia organizations Within the United States, since approximately 1992, there have been a number of private organizations that call themselves militia or unorganized militia.Mulloy, Darren. American Extremism: History, Politics and the Militia Movement, Routledge, 2004. In states such as Texas, the state constitution classifies male citizens between the ages of 17 and 45 to belong to the \\"Unorganized Reserve Militia\\".http://constitution.org/mil/ustx_law.htm The Texas constitution also grants the county sheriff and the governor of the state the authority to call upon the unorganized reserve militia to uphold the peace, repel invasion, and suppress rebellion, similar to the early \\"Texas Rangers\\". One militia in the United States has modeled themselves after the state defense forces on a national level. They are known as the United States National Defense Corps.UNITED STATES NATIONAL DEFENSE CORPS The US National Defense Corps is a militia para-military organization and corporation. The mission of the USNDC CORPORATION is to provide emergency support services, in the best interest of the community or upon request, to recognized outside agencies in the event of both manmade and natural disasters and to provide activities to honor and support our veterans and their families.

Clastic rocks are composed of fragments, or clasts, of pre-existing minerals and rock. A clast is a fragment of geological detritus,Essentials of Geology, 3rd Ed, Stephen Marshak, p. G-3 chunks and smaller grains of rock broken off other rocks by physical weathering.Essentials of Geology, 3rd Ed, Stephen Marshak, p. G-5 Geologists use the term clastic with reference to sedimentary rocks as well as to particles in sediment transport whether in suspension or as bed load, and in sediment deposits.  Sedimentary clastic rocks  Claystone from Montana Clastic sedimentary rocks are rocks composed predominantly of broken pieces or clasts of older weathered and eroded rocks. Clastic sediments or sedimentary rocks are classified based on grain size, clast and cementing material (matrix) composition, and texture. The classification factors are often useful in determining a sample's environment of deposition. An example of clastic environment would be a river system in which the full range of grains being transported by the moving water consist of pieces eroded from solid rock upstream. Grain size varies from clay in shales and claystones; through silt in siltstones; sand in sandstones; and gravel, cobble, to boulder sized fragments in conglomerates and breccias. The Krumbein phi (œÜ) scale numerically orders these terms in a logarithmic size scale.  Siliciclastic sedimentary rocks  Siliciclastic rocks are clastic noncarbonate rocks that are composed almost exclusively of silicon, either as forms of quartz or as silicates. =Composition= The composition of siliciclastic sedimentary rocks includes the chemical and mineralogical components of the framework as well as the cementing material that make up these rocks. Boggs divides them into four categories; major minerals, accessory minerals, rock fragments, and chemical sediments.Boggs, Jr., Sam. Principles of Sedimentology and Stratigraphy. Pearson Prentice Hall: Upper Saddle River, New Jersey, 2006 Major minerals can be categorized into subdivisions based on their resistance to chemical decomposition. Those that possess a great resistance to decomposition are categorized as stable, while those that do not are considered less stable. The most common stable mineral in siliciclastic sedimentary rocks is quartz (SiO2). Quartz makes up approximately 65 percent of framework grains present in sandstones and about 30 percent of minerals in the average shale. Less stable minerals present in this type of rocks are feldspars, including both potassium and plagioclase feldspars. Feldspars comprise a considerably lesser portion of framework grains and minerals. They only make up about 15 percent of framework grains in sandstones and 5% of minerals in shales. Clay mineral groups are mostly present in mudrocks (comprising more than 60% of the minerals) but can be found in other siliciclastic sedimentary rocks at considerably lower levels. Accessory minerals are associated with those whose presence in the rock are not directly important to the classification of the specimen. These generally occur in smaller amounts in comparison to the quartz, and feldspars. Furthermore, those that do occur are generally heavy minerals or coarse grained micas (both muscovite and biotite). Rock fragments also occur in the composition of siliciclastic sedimentary rocks and are responsible for about 10‚Äì15 percent of the composition of sandstone. They generally make up most of the gravel size particles in conglomerates but contribute only a very small amount to the composition of mudrocks. Though they sometimes are, rock fragments are not always sedimentary in origin. They can also be metamorphic or igneous. Chemical cements vary in abundance but are predominantly found in sandstones. The two major types are silicate based and carbonate based. The majority of silica cements are composed of quartz, but can include chert, opal, feldspars and zeolites. Composition includes the chemical and mineralogic make-up of the single or varied fragments and the cementing material (matrix) holding the clasts together as a rock. These differences are most commonly used in the framework grains of sandstones. Sandstones rich in quartz are called quartz arenites, those rich in feldspar are called arkoses, and those rich in lithics are called lithic sandstones. = Classification = Siliciclastic sedimentary rocks are composed of mainly silicate particles derived from the weathering of older rocks and pyroclastic volcanism. While grain size, clast and cementing material (matrix) composition, and texture are important factors when regarding composition, siliciclastic sedimentary rocks are classified according to grain size into three major categories: conglomerates, sandstones, and mudrocks. The term clay is used to classify particles smaller than .0039 millimeters. However, the term can also be used to refer to a family of sheet silicate minerals. Silt refers to particles that have a diameter between .062 and .0039 millimeters. The term mud is used when clay and silt particles are mixed in the sediment; mudrock is the name of the rock created with these sediments. Furthermore, particles that reach diameters between .062 and 2 millimeters fall into the category of sand. When sand is cemented together and lithified it becomes known as sandstone. Any particle that is larger than two millimeters is considered gravel. This category includes pebbles, cobbles and boulders. Like sandstone, when gravels are lithified they are considered conglomerates.  Conglomerates and breccias  Conglomerate Breccia. Notice the angular nature of the large clasts Conglomerates are coarse grained rocks dominantly composed of gravel sized particles that are typically held together by a finer grained matrix.Neuendorf, Klaus; Mehl, James; Jackson, Julia Glossary of Geology, Fifth Edition. American Geological Institute: Alexandria, VA; 2005. These rocks are often subdivided into conglomerates and breccias. The major characteristic that divides these two categories is the amount of rounding. The gravel sized particles that make up conglomerates are well rounded while in breccias they are angular. Conglomerates are common in stratigraphic successions of most, if not all, ages but only make up one percent or less, by weight, of the total sedimentary rock mass. In terms of origin and depositional mechanisms they are very similar to sandstones. As a result, the two categories often contain the same sedimentary structures. Sandstones Sandstone from Lower Antelope Canyon Sandstones are medium-grained rocks composed of rounded or angular fragments of sand size, that often but not always have a cement uniting them together. These sand-size particles are often quartz but there are a few common categories and a wide variety of classification schemes that classify sandstones based on composition. Classification schemes vary widely, but most geologists have adopted the Dott scheme,Dott, R. H., Wacke, graywacke and matrix ‚Äì What Approach to Immature Sandstone Classification: Journal of Sedimentary Petrology, v. 34, pp. 625‚Äì32., 1996. which uses the relative abundance of quartz, feldspar, and lithic framework grains and the abundance of muddy matrix between these larger grains. Mudrocks Rocks that are classified as mudrocks are very fine grained. Silt and clay represent at least 50% of the material that mudrocks are composed of. Classification schemes for mudrocks tend to vary, but most are based on the grain size of the major constituents. In mudrocks, these are generally silt, and clay.Spears, D.A., Sam. Towards a classification of Shales. J. geol. soc., London, 137, 1990. According to Blatt, Middleton and Murray Blatt, h., Middleton, G. V. & Murray, R. C. 1972. Origin of Sedimentary Rocks. Prentice Hall Inc., Englewood Cliffs, 634 pp. mudrocks that are composed mainly of silt particles are classified as siltstones. In turn, rocks that possess clay as the majority particle are called claystones. In geology, a mixture of both silt and clay is called mud. Rocks that possess large amounts of both clay and silt are called mudstones. In some cases the term shale is also used to refer to mudrocks and is still widely accepted by most. However, others have used the term shale to further divide mudrocks based on the percentage of clay constituents. The plate-like shape of clay allows its particles to stack up one on top of another, creating laminae or beds. The more clay present in a given specimen, the more laminated a rock is. Shale, in this case, is reserved for mudrocks that are laminated, while mudstone refers those that are not. Image:Red mudrock.JPGRed mudrock Image:MarcellusShaleCloseUp.jpgBlack Shale  Diagenesis of siliciclastic sedimentary rocks  Siliciclastic rocks initially form as loosely packed sediment deposits including gravels, sands, and muds. The process of turning loose sediment into hard sedimentary rocks is called lithification. During the process of lithification, sediments undergo physical, chemical and mineralogical changes before becoming rock. The primary physical process in lithification is compaction. As sediment transport and deposition continues, new sediments are deposited atop previously deposited beds, burying them. Burial continues and the weight of overlying sediments causes an increase in temperature and pressure. This increase in temperature and pressure causes loose grained sediments become tightly packed, reducing porosity, essentially squeezing water out of the sediment. Porosity is further reduced by the precipitation of minerals into the remaining pore spaces. The final stage in the process is diagenesis and will be discussed in detail below. =Cementation= Cementation is the diagenetic process by which coarse clastic sediments become lithified or consolidated into hard, compact rocks, usually through the deposition or precipitation of minerals in the spaces between the individual grains of sediment. Cementation can occur simultaneously with deposition or at another time. Furthermore, once a sediment is deposited, it becomes subject to cementation through the various stages of diagenesis discussed below. =Shallow burial (eogenesis)= Eogenesis refers to the early stages of diagenesis. This can take place at very shallow depths, ranging from a few meters to tens of meters below the surface. The changes that occur during this diagenetic phase mainly relate to the reworking of the sediments. Compaction and grain repacking, bioturbation, as well as mineralogical changes all occur at varying degrees. Due to the shallow depths, sediments undergo only minor compaction and grain rearrangement during this stage. Organisms rework sediment near the depositional interface by burrowing, crawling, and in some cases sediment ingestion. This process can destroy sedimentary structures that were present upon deposition of the sediment. Structures such as lamination will give way to new structures associated with the activity of organisms. Despite being close to the surface, eogenesis does provide conditions for important mineralogical changes to occur. This mainly involves the precipitation of new minerals. Mineralogical changes during eogenesis Mineralogical changes that occur during eogenesis are dependent on the environment in which that sediment has been deposited. For example, the formation of pyrite is characteristic of reducing conditions in marine environments. Pyrite can form as cement, or replace organic materials, such as wood fragments. Other important reactions include the formation of chlorite, glauconite, illite and iron oxide (if oxygenated pore water is present). The precipitation of potassium feldspar, quartz overgrowths, and carbonate cements also occurs under marine conditions. In non marine environments oxidizing conditions are almost always prevalent, meaning iron oxides are commonly produced along with kaolin group clay minerals. The precipitation of quartz and calcite cements may also occur in non marine conditions. = Deep burial (mesogenesis) Compaction As sediments are buried deeper, load pressures become greater resulting in tight grain packing and bed thinning. This causes increased pressure between grains thus increasing the solubility of grains. As a result, the partial dissolution of silicate grains occurs. This is called pressure solutions. Chemically speaking, increases in temperature can also cause chemical reaction rates to increase. This increases the solubility of most common minerals (aside from evaporites). Furthermore, beds thin and porosity decreases allowing cementation to occur by the precipitation of silica or carbonate cements into remaining pore space. In this process minerals crystallize from watery solutions that percolate through the pores between grain of sediment. The cement that is produced may or may not have the same chemical composition as the sediment. In sandstones, framework grains are often cemented by silica or carbonate. The extent of cementation is dependent on the composition of the sediment. For example, in lithic sandstones, cementation is less extensive because pore space between framework grains is filled with a muddy matrix that leaves little space for precipitation to occur. This is often the case for mudrocks as well. As a result of compaction, the clayey sediments comprising mudrocks are relatively impermeable. Dissolution Dissolution of framework silicate grains and previously formed carbonate cement may occur during deep burial. Conditions that encourage this are essentially opposite of those required for cementation. Rock fragments and silicate minerals of low stability, such as plagioclase feldspar, pyroxenes, and amphiboles, may dissolve as a result of increasing burial temperatures and the presence of organic acids in pore waters. The dissolution of frame work grains and cements increases porosity particularly in sandstones. Mineral replacement This refers to the process whereby one mineral is dissolved and a new mineral fills the space via precipitation. Replacement can be partial or complete. Complete replacement destroys the identity of the original minerals or rock fragments giving a biased view of the original mineralogy of the rock. Porosity can also be affected by this process. For example, clay minerals tend to fill up pore space and thereby reducing porosity. =Telogenesis= In the process of burial, it is possible that siliciclastic deposits may subsequently be uplifted as a result of a mountain building event or erosion. When uplift occurs, it exposes buried deposits to a radically new environment. Because the process brings material to or closer to the surface, sediments that undergo uplift are subjected to lower temperatures and pressures as well as slightly acidic rain water. Under these conditions, framework grains and cement are again subjected to dissolution and in turn increasing porosity. On the other hand, telogenesis can also change framework grains to clays, thus reducing porosity. These changes are dependent on the specific conditions that the rock is exposed as well as the composition of the rock and pore waters. Specific pore waters, can cause the further precipitation of carbonate or silica cements. This process can also encourage the process of oxidation on a variety of iron bearing minerals.  Sedimentary breccias  Sedimentary breccias are a type of clastic sedimentary rock which are composed of angular to subangular, randomly oriented clasts of other sedimentary rocks. They may form either: # In submarine debris flows, avalanches, mud flow or mass flow in an aqueous medium. Technically, turbidites are a form of debris flow deposit and are a fine-grained peripheral deposit to a sedimentary breccia flow. # As angular, poorly sorted, very immature fragments of rocks in a finer grained groundmass which are produced by mass wasting. These are, in essence, lithified colluvium. Thick sequences of sedimentary (colluvial) breccias are generally formed next to fault scarps in grabens. In the field, it may at times be difficult to distinguish between a debris flow sedimentary breccia and a colluvial breccia, especially if one is working entirely from drilling information. Sedimentary breccias are an integral host rock for many sedimentary exhalative deposits.  Igneous clastic rocks  Basalt breccia, green groundmass is composed of epidote Clastic igneous rocks include pyroclastic volcanic rocks such as tuff, agglomerate and intrusive breccias, as well as some marginal eutaxitic and taxitic intrusive morphologies. Igneous clastic rocks are broken by flow, injection or explosive disruption of solid or semi-solid igneous rocks or lavas. Igneous clastic rocks can be divided into two classes: # Broken, fragmental rocks produced by intrusive processes, usually associated with plutons or porphyry stocks # Broken, fragmental rocks associated with volcanic eruptions, both of lava and pyroclastic type  Metamorphic clastic rocks  Clastic metamorphic rocks include breccias formed in faults, as well as some protomylonite and pseudotachylite. Occasionally, metamorphic rocks can be brecciated via hydrothermal fluids, forming a hydrofracture breccia.  Hydrothermal clastic rocks  Hydrothermal clastic rocks are generally restricted to those formed by hydrofracture, the process by which hydrothermal circulation cracks and brecciates the wall rocks and fills it in with veins. This is particularly prominent in epithermal ore deposits and is associated with alteration zones around many intrusive rocks, especially granites. Many skarn and greisen deposits are associated with hydrothermal breccias.  Impact breccias  A fairly rare form of clastic rock may form during meteorite impact. This is composed primarily of ejecta; clasts of country rock, melted rock fragments, tektites (glass ejected from the impact crater) and exotic fragments, including fragments derived from the impactor itself. Identifying a clastic rock as an impact breccia requires recognising shatter cones, tektites, spherulites, and the morphology of an impact crater, as well as potentially recognizing particular chemical and trace element signatures, especially osmiridium.

Strong Family and Low Fertility. 2004, page 92 originally in a context of \\"tribalism\\" and \\"clanism\\". It was familiar in the pre-Islamic era, but became popularized in Ibn Khaldun's Muqaddimah where it is described as the fundamental bond of human society and the basic motive force of history, pure only in its nomadic form.  øAsabiyya is neither necessarily nomadic nor based on blood relations; rather, it resembles philosophy of classical republicanism. In the modern period, it is generally analogous to solidarity. However, it is often negatively associated because it can sometimes suggest loyalty to one's group regardless of circumstances, or partisanship.Weir, Shelagh. A Tribal Order. 2007, page 191 Ibn Khaldun also argued that  øasabiyya is cyclical and directly related to the rise and fall of civilizations: it is most strong at the start of a civilization, declines as the civilization advances, and then another more compelling  øasabiyyah eventually takes its place to help establish a different civilization. Overview Ibn Khaldun describes Asabiyyah as the bond of cohesion among humans in a group forming community. The bond, Asabiyyah, exists at any level of civilization, from nomadic society to states and empires.Tibi, Bassam. Arab nationalism. 1997, page 139 Asabiyyah is most strong in the nomadic phase, and decreases as civilization advances. As this Asabiyyah declines, another more compelling Asabiyyah may take its place; thus, civilizations rise and fall, and history describes these cycles of Asabiyyah as they play out. Ibn Khaldun argues that each dynasty (or civilization) has within itself the seeds of its own downfall. He explains that ruling houses tend to emerge on the peripheries of great empires and use the much stronger  øasabiyya present in those areas to their advantage, in order to bring about a change in leadership. This implies that the new rulers are at first considered \\"barbarians\\" by comparison to the old ones. As they establish themselves at the center of their empire, they become increasingly lax, less coordinated, disciplined and watchful, and more concerned with maintaining their new power and lifestyle. The  øasabiyya, dissolves into factionalism and individualism, diminishing their capacity as a political unit. Thus, conditions are created wherein a new dynasty can emerge at the periphery of their control, grow strong, and effect a change in leadership, beginning the cycle anew. Ibn Khaldun also further states in the Muqaddimah that \\"dynasties have a natural life span like individuals\\", and that no dynasty generally lasts beyond three generations of about 40 years each.

She was the daughter of King Henry II of Castile and his wife Juana Manuel of Castile, who was descended from a cadet branch of the Castilian royal house. Eleanor was a member of the House of Trast√°mara. Biography=Betrothals and marriage Jaime Serra (c. 1375) Eleanor was involved with plans to marry King Ferdinand I of Portugal in 1371, however he refused the match as he had secretly married the noblewoman Leonor Telles de Menezes. She was betrothed in Burgos in 1373 to Prince Charles, the heir of King Charles II of Navarre. The couple was married at Soria in May 1375. A testament dated at Burgos on 29 May 1374 shows that King Henry II bequeathed property to his daughter Eleanor as a part of her dowry. The Years in Castile The marriage of Charles and Eleanor was marked by a number of unusual marital disputes. In 1388, Eleanor asked at a meeting between her husband and her brother John I of Castile for permission to retire for some time to her homeland of Castile in order to recover from an illness caught in Navarre. She believed this course of action would be best for her health. The two young daughters in her care at the time went with her. During their absence from Navarre, Eleanor and her children resided in Valladolid. By 1390, Eleanor bore two more daughters to Charles, and two years later, her husband requested her to return to Navarre because both of them needed to be crowned King and Queen of Navarre upon the death of her father-in-law King Charles II. Eleanor's brother King John supported the request of Charles III. Eleanor did not consent, claiming that she was ill-treated in Navarre and believed members of the Navarrese nobility wished to poison her. As a result, Eleanor remained in Castile while her husband was crowned in February 1390 in Pamplona. By the end of the 1390s, Eleanor had born her husband six daughters, all of whom survived infancy, but no sons. For this reason, Eleanor handed her oldest daughter Joanna over to Charles III to be groomed for her future role as ruler of the Kingdom of Navarre. On 9 October 1390, Eleanor's brother John died and was succeeded by his minor son Henry as king of Castile. Charles then requested Eleanor's return to Navarre again, but she refused once more. Eleanor opposed her nephew Henry's accession and she formed the League of Lillo along with her illegitimate half-brother Fadrique and her cousin Pedro. King Henry opposed the League, besieged Eleanor in her castle at Roa around mid-1394, and obliged her to return to her husband in February 1395. Queen of Navarre Eleanor became very involved in the political life of Navarre upon her return. Her relationship with her husband improved, and she bore him the long-awaited sons Charles and Louis. Both died young, however. On 3 June 1403, her coronation as Queen of Navarre took place in Pamplona. Upon several occasions when Charles stayed in France, Eleanor took to the role of regent. She also helped to maintain good relations between Navarre and Castile. As a result of these good relations, members of the Castillian nobility, including the Duke of Benavente and members of the powerful families of D√°valos, Mendoza and Zu√±iga, settled in Navarre. Upon the couple's absences, their daughter Joanna acted as regent, as she was heiress to the kingdom. Joanna died in 1413 without issue and in the lifetime of both her parents, therefore the succession turned to their second daughter Blanche, who would eventually succeed as Queen of Navarre upon Charles' death. There is confusion surrounding Eleanor's death. She is believed to have died at Olite on 27 February 1415 or at Pamplona 5 March 1416. Her husband died in 1425, and they were buried together at Pamplona in the Cathedral of Santa Mar√≠a la Real. Issue The coat of arms of Eleanor as Queen of Navarre Eleanor and Charles had eight children, five of which lived to adulthood: *Joanna (1382‚Äì1413), married John I, Count of Foix, no issue. *Blanche (1385-1441), married John II of Aragon, became Queen of Navarre and had issue. *Maria (1388‚Äì1406), died unmarried and childless. *Margaret (1390‚Äì1403), died young *Beatrice (1392‚Äì1412), married to James II, Count of La Marche, and had issue. *Isabella (1395‚Äì1435), married in 1419 to John IV of Armagnac, had issue; they were great-great grandparents of King Henry IV of France. *Charles(1397‚Äì1402), Prince of Viana, died young *Louis (1402), Prince of Viana, died young AncestryReferencesSources  Category:14th-century births Category:1416 deaths Category:Medieval Spanish nobility Eleanor Category:Navarrese royal consorts Category:14th-century people from the Kingdom of Navarre Category:15th-century people from the Kingdom of Navarre Category:Countesses of √âvreux Category:Consorts of Montpellier Category:Castilian infantas Category:Burials at Pamplona Cathedral Category:14th-century Spanish women Category:15th-century Spanish women ","title":"Eleanor of Castile, Queen of Navarre"},{"id":"4158217","text":"KZOO or Kay-Zoo (1210 AM) is a radio station catering to the Japanese community of Honolulu, Hawaii. The station plays news, talk shows, and J-Pop. It is owned by Polynesian Broadcasting, Inc. KZOO also retransmits on Oceanic Time Warner Cable digital channel 888 for the entire state of Hawaii. KZOO has been broadcasting continuously in Japanese since the station signed on October 18, 1963. It was not the first Japanese-language station in Honolulu (competitor KOHO/1170 signed on in 1959), but it is the only one still on the air today. History The station has been owned by Polynesian Broadcasting since 1967, when businessman Noboru Furuya took over KZOO's operations. Furuya's son David and his wife Robyn took over management of the station in the mid-1990s when Furuya's health began to decline. Noboru Furuya died in 2002 at the age of 82; David and Robyn Furuya (now the president and vice- president, respectively, of Polynesian Broadcasting) continue to run KZOO today. Though most of their programs are broadcast from their offices at the Japanese Cultural Center of Hawaii, in 2011 KZOO began broadcasting special interviews from a studio in the Shirokiya in Ala Moana Shopping Center. Programming KZOO's programs include news, talk shows, and Japanese music. Most of it is original programming, but some of the talk shows are from Japan. Many of KZOO's current on-air staff have been with the station for decades, including Keiko Ura, host of an Okinawan language show on Sundays, who joined the station in early 1964; Maki Norris, one of the hosts of a popular daily talk show called \\"Moshi-Moshi Time,\\" who has worked at KZOO since 1976; and Harumi \\"Danny\\" Oshita. KZOO has a history of sponsoring Japanese speech (Nihongo Hanashikata Taikai, started by announcer Keiko Ura in 1965) and nodojiman and karaoke song contests in Honolulu, with winners going on to represent Hawaii at contests in Japan. The station's broadcast day also includes simulcasts of programs from Japan as well as local talk and advice shows on a variety of topics, from health to the law. Disaster relief When KZOO was knocked off the air by the 2006 Kiholo Bay earthquake, the station's assistant general manager, Kaoru Ekimoto, contacted English-language adult contemporary music station KSSK, who put her on the air with disaster relief information in Japanese; the station also set up a hotline to answer listener questions. The station later added a backup generator for its transmitter.

It is one of the oldest boarding schools for boys in Asia, having been founded on 28 July 1859 by Bishop George Edward Lynch Cotton. Bishop Cotton also founded the Bishop Cotton School, Nagpur. The alumni of Bishop Cotton are known as Old Cottonians. The Bishop Cotton School, Shimla celebrated 150 years of existence in 2009. The school has produced army officers, ambassadors, judges, ministers, and politicians. Bishop Cotton School has been ranked among the best boys-only residential schools of India by media such as The Times of India, Outlook, and Education World. History Bishop George Edward Lynch Cotton was a scholar of Westminster, and a graduate of Cambridge University. In 1836 he was appointed Assistant Master at Rugby School by Doctor Thomas Arnold, one of the founders of the British public school system. It was the young Mr. Cotton who was spoken of as 'the model young master' in Thomas Hughe's famous book 'Tom Brown's School Days'. The school opened for students on 15 March 1863. Though mentioned in correspondence as the Simla Public School, it never actually bore this name. The first boy, Frederick Naylor, joined the school on 16 March 1863. Bishop Cotton reconnoitred ten sites in September and October 1864, and finally approved the South end of Knollswood Spur which belonged to the Rajah of Keonthal. After negotiations the site was acquired through the intervention of the Viceroy and the foundation stone for the new buildings was laid on 26 September 1866, by the Viceroy, Sir John Lawrence, brother of Sir Henry Lawrence, founder of the famous Lawrence School, Sanawar. In September 1868, the school moved to Knollswood, the present site. Bishop Cotton was inspired by the phrase, \\"Overcome Evil With Good\\" from Romans 12:21. Head Masters *The Rev. S. Slater D.D.

The children have class teachers who function like house tutors for the children of their classes. Prefectorial System Bishop Cotton School was again the first school in India to start the Prefectorial System. Today, the school authorities consist of the four house captains, the school captain, and the school prefect. Curriculum 2009 stamp dedicated to Bishop Cotton School The school has its own curriculum for classes III to VIII. Classes IX to XII follow the CISCE syllabus. Every boy goes on for tertiary education at the end of year XII, and the success rate for the board examination is usually 100%. The teaching system is backed by a remedial address system, and since the boys and staff are residents, every teacher is accessible at any time if a child seeks help. The school has provisions for helping children with special needs. The school runs The Learning Centre, which is an education centre for non-resident, intellectually-challenged children of Shimla town. Buildings and grounds The staff are housed in Linlithgow house. Next to this is the Holy Trinity Chapel and between them is Canning Gate and Lawrence Gate which can be identified with The Lawrence School, Sanawar crest bearing the legend \\"Be ready\\". Viceroy Lawrence laid the foundation stone of the school at the present site. Facing the main school building are Rivaz, Ibbetson and Lefroy dormitory houses. Curzon dormitory house is at the right back end. Opposite Lefroy is the War Memorial and Museum with a cannon and an aircraft further along. Between Lefroy and the War Memorial is an arched hedge that leads past a tiny rose garden to the Headmaster's Lodge and the Lady Willingdon Swimming Bath. In front of the porch is a fountain commemorating Sardar Sohan Singh. The main hall of the school is Irwin Hall. Behind this is the Senior Master's Lodge to the left of which is the park and to its right Litster Hall and the laboratories. Sports facilities include the Bawa Squash Courts and Shankar Hall for indoor badminton. Dormitories From classes 3 to 8 the boys live in dormitories under the care and supervision of Matrons, boys of the same age group are together. The Remove Building commemorates Ronald and Zoe Hakim (Staff 1969‚Äì86; HM: 1987‚Äì94). Each dormitory has about 34 boys. Class III and IV lives in Linlithgow, Class V lives in Iron's Dormitory, Class VI lives in Sinker Dormitory, VII lives Stooks and Class VIII lives in Lewis Dormitory. Dormitory From class IX the boys move up to the Main School, which dates back to the 1860s, and live in their Houses with all boys of a particular house together. They are under the direct control and supervision of their House Masters, Captains and Prefects.

These species, also called Tasmanian snow scorpionflies, are found in moss in Tasmania and southern Australia. The adults are generalised predators. The larvae live in moss and are locally common. Apteropanorpa is probably an austral ecological counterpart of the Northern Hemisphere Boreidae, adapting to colder climates by losing its wings and feeding on the abundant understory mosses. Both groups have been collected on snow and at high elevations. However, these two groups are probably not sister groups, as males of Apteropanorpa have developed the bulbous, recurved abdomen found in advanced families, such as Panorpidae.

According to the political scientist Andrew Stark, \\"[i]n self-dealing, an officeholder's official role allows her to affect one or more of her own personal interests.\\" It is a form of conflict of interest. Self-dealing may involve misappropriation or usurpation of corporate assets or opportunities. Political scientists Ken Kernaghan and John Langford define self-dealing as \\"a situation where one takes an action in an official capacity which involves dealing with oneself in a private capacity and which confers a benefit on oneself.\\" Examples include \\"work[ing] for government and us[ing] your official position to secure a contract for a private consulting company you own\\" or \\"using your government position to get a summer job for your daughter.\\" Where a fiduciary has engaged in self-dealing, this constitutes a breach of the fiduciary relationship. The principal of that fiduciary (the person to whom duties are owed) may sue and both recover the principal's lost profits and disgorge the fiduciary's wrongful profits.

It is known to have been practiced by the Islamic prophet Muhammad. Bay øah is sometimes taken under a written pact given on behalf of the subjects by leading members of the tribe with the understanding that as long as the leader abides by certain requirements towards his people, they are to maintain their allegiance to him. Bay øah is still practiced in countries such as Saudi Arabia and Sudan. In Morocco, bay øah is one of the foundations of the monarchy. Etymology Bay'ah derives from the Semitic triconsonontal root B-Y-‚Äô, related to selling, and shows the contractual nature of the bond between caliph and people. Bay'ah originally referred to the striking together of hands between buyer and seller to mark an agreement.  In Islamic history  The tradition of bay øah can be traced back to the era of Muhammad. From the beginning bay øah was taken by Muhammad as an oath of allegiance. Anybody who wanted to join the Islamic community did so by reciting the basic statement of the faith expressing his faith in the oneness of God and the prophethood of Muhammad. However, this differed from the proclamation of faith necessary to simply become a Muslim. In addition to this the prophet formally took bay øah from the people and tribes. Through this formal act they entered the Islamic community and showed their willingness to follow and obey Muhammad. The wordings of the oath differ in different traditions but it contains the shahada and prayers of repentance. It is reported that at the occasion of annual gatherings outside Mecca, Muhammad met people from Yathrib, later to be renamed Medina, who accepted his call towards Islam. Muhammad then took bay øah from them.  In the Qur'an  Bay'ah Ceremony of the Commanders of Islamic Revolution Committees with Ali Khamenei, 8 June 1989 Bay'ah to Abu Bakr as the first Muslim caliph after 632 CE After the Pledge of the Tree, which led to the Treaty of Hudaybiyyah, the following was revealed in the Qur'an commemorating and appreciating the pledge and those who made it:  History  The bay'ah of Rizwan, a collective initiation of thousands of Muslims at the hand of Muhammad, is mentioned in the Qur'an. The tradition was continued by the caliphs. In subsequent ages, it was associated with Sufi orders, and spiritual masters would initiate their followers. The practice still exists in Sufi orders around the world. Content of the bay'ah The Bayah usually consists of a relatively standardised formulation such as the following: I give my allegiance to .... to hear and obey in times of difficulty and comfort, in hardship and ease, and to endure being discriminated against, and not to dispute about rule with those in power, except in case of evident infidelity regarding that which there is a proof from Allah,‚Äù  See also  * Bay'ah (Ahmadiyya) * Bay'ah Mosque  References  Category:Islamic culture Category:Islamic jurisprudence Category:Politics of Morocco Category:Islamic terminology ","title":"Bay'ah"},{"id":"4158406","text":"Ramadugu is a village in Ramadugu mandal of Karimnagar district, Telangana State, India.

Semde (; Sanskrit: cittavarga) translated as \\"mind division\\", \\"mind class\\" or \\"mind series\\" is the name of one of three scriptural and lineage divisions within Atiyoga, Dzogchen or the Great Perfection which is itself the pinnacle of the ninefold division of practice according to the Nyingma school of Tibetan Buddhism. Semde emphasizes the clarity (gsal-ba) or the innate awareness (rig- pa) aspect of the Natural State. Penor Rinpoche states that due to the different approaches of various Dzogchen lineages, three sub-schools have developed of which semde is one. The other two divisions or schools are Longde (Space Series) and Menngagde (Oral Instruction Series). The Mind School is attributed to Sri Singha and Vairotsana's lineage Background These three divisions were introduced by the Buddhist scholar Manjushrimitra. As Great Perfection texts, the texts of all three divisions are concerned with the basic primordial state, the nature of mind-itself (which is contrasted with normal conscious mind). They are related to the 'Three statements' of Prahevajra. It is important to note that the three series do not represent different schools of Dzogchen practice as much as different approaches to the same goal, that being the basic, natural, and primordial state. As is common throughout much Buddhist literature, Tibetan Buddhism in particular, gradations in the faculties of practitioners are also ascribed to the three divisions, they being seen as appropriate for practitioners of low, middling, and high faculties, respectively. Germano (2005: p.12) states that: > The earliest revelations of the Great Perfection are those said to have been > disseminated in Tibet in the latter half of the eighth century, and which > retroactively were classified as the Mind Series to distinguish them from > later developments. They begin with a collection of quite short texts known > as The Eighteen Texts of the Mind Series (Sems sde bco brgyad), and then > subsequently proliferate into a large family of texts spawned by the > original collection‚Äôs expansion, modification, and so forth, culminating in > a series of texts centered on The All-Creating King (Kun byed rgyal po). > Most of the resultant sub-divisions of the Mind Series rubric have names > based upon geographical regions, clans, or individual founders. > Padmasambhava (eighth century) does not figure prominently ‚Äì if at all ‚Äì in > these early Great Perfection traditions; rather, ≈örƒ´si·πÅha (eighth century), > Dga‚Äô rab rdo rje (seventh century?), and Vimalamitra (eighth-ninth century) > are the main Indian figures cited as involved in their authorship, > redaction, transmission, and translation. (NB: original text not meta- > enhanced.) Distinguishing Features of the Mind Division Texts of the Mind Division emphasize that the totality of phenomena that present themselves to us are nothing more than apparitions or projections of the mind. As the Mind Division is related to the first statement of Prahevajra, Semde texts emphasize the direct introduction to the natural state of mind, including explanations of this state and methods for recognizing it. Texts of the Mind Division The mind class (semde) of Dzogchen was also said to comprise eighteen tantras, although the formulation eventually came to include slightly more. Tantras belonging to the Mind Division include: # Cuckoo of Spiritual Awareness () Skt: svasti ≈õrƒ´ vidyƒÅ kokila # Great Potency () Skt: bodhicitta mahƒÅ pu·π£·π≠i tantra # Great Garuda in Flight () # Refining Gold from Ore () # Great Space Never-Waning Banner Scripture () # Spontaneous Summit Scripture () # King of Space () # Jewel-Encrusted Bliss Ornament () # All-Encompassing Perfection () # Essence of Bodhicitta () # Infinite Bliss () # Wheel of Life () Skt: ƒÅyo cakra # Six Spheres () # All-Penetrating Perfection () # Wish-Fulfilling Jewel () # All-Unifying Spiritual Awareness () # Supreme Lord () # The Realization of the True Meaning of Meditation () # KulayarƒÅja Tantra Skt: sarva dharma mahƒÅ sandhi bodhicitta kulaya rƒÅja # The Marvelous Mind of Enlightenment () # The Ten Concluding Teachings Another listing drawn from The Lotus Born Schmidt, Erik Hein, and Marcia Binder, ed. 1993.

Orphaned at an early age, she spent her childhood in the court of Holy Roman Emperor Frederick III. As one of the three surviving grandchildren of Emperor Sigismund, she had a strong claim to the kingdoms of Hungary and Bohemia. That made her an attractive bride for a Polish prince. The Polish nobility, seeking to increase Polish influence in Hungary and Bohemia, pursued marriage with Elizabeth since she was born and finally succeeded in 1454. Her marriage to Casimir was one of the most successful royal marriages in Poland. She gave birth to thirteen children, eleven of whom survived to adulthood. Four of her sons were crowned as kings. Early life= Tumultuous childhood Elisabeth was the daughter of Albert II of Germany, Archduke of Austria, and his wife Elizabeth of Luxembourg, daughter of Emperor Sigismund. The exact date of her birth is unknown and has been variously provided between 1436 and early 1439.Duczmal (2012), p. 145 Her elder brother was born in February 1435. Polish chronicler Jan D≈Çugosz mentioned that Polish envoys traveled to Vienna in autumn 1436 to negotiate with Emperor Sigismund a marriage between his granddaughters, Anne and Elisabeth, who were considered heirs to the thrones of Bohemia and Hungary, and Polish princes W≈Çadys≈Çaw and Casimir. While the negotiations ended without a decisive agreement, they allowed historians to conclude that Elisabeth was born in the first half of 1436. Elisabeth's early life was marked by political turmoil. After the death of Emperor Sigismund in December 1437, Elisabeth's father was crowned as King of Hungary and Bohemia. His Bohemian title was challenged by the Hussites who promoted Polish prince Casimir IV Jagiellon as their king and a war erupted. Polish diplomats continued to pursue the plan for a marriage between Casimir and Elisabeth, who would bring Bohemia as a dowry. King Albert received the diplomats coolly as he had no intentions of surrendering his claims to Bohemia.Duczmal (2012), pp. 149‚Äì150 In March 1439, Elisabeth's sister, Anne, was betrothed to William III, Landgrave of Thuringia, son of Frederick I, Elector of Saxony, and was sent to live at the Saxonian court.Duczmal (2012), p. 144 King Albert died in October 1439 after a brief campaign against the Ottoman Empire. His pregnant widow considered herself to be the only rightful heir of Emperor Sigismund and fought to crown her son Ladislaus the Posthumous as King of Hungary while Hungarian nobles selected Polish King W≈Çadys≈Çaw III.Duczmal (2012), pp. 145‚Äì146 Princess Elisabeth's nanny Helene Kottannerin stole the Holy Crown of Hungary and brought it to Queen Elisabeth in Kom√°rno.Duczmal (2012), p. 146 Three-month-old Ladislaus was crowned on 15 May 1440, but that did not stop the civil war. For their safety and protection, the two children of Albert and Elisabeth were placed in the care of Frederick III, elected but not crowned Holy Roman Emperor. As part of the agreement Elisabeth was betrothed to Frederick, nephew of Frederick III and son of Frederick II, Elector of Saxony, and Margaret of Austria.Duczmal (2012), p. 150 At the emperor's court Elisabeth and Ladislaus were initially cared by Anna von Pottendorf at the Forchtenstein Castle.Duczmal (2012), p. 146 When Queen Elisabeth died in December 1442, Emperor Frederick III continued to care for the orphans who spent most of their time in Graz and Wiener Neustadt. The opposition accused the Emperor of neglecting the children, but that could be just political propaganda. Emperor Frederick III was known to be emotionally distant and frugal, but he also provided both children with a good education. Enea Silvio Piccolomini, the emperor's secretary and future Pope Pius II, wrote De liberorum educatione as instruction for educating the children.Duczmal (2012), p. 147 A 1973 study of Elisabeth's remains revealed that she most likely had spinal tuberculosis at a young age.Duczmal (2012), p. 160 That left her skeleton visibly deformed: s-shaped spine, misaligned jaws, head cocked to the right, deformed thorax. The permanent tilt of her head led to stunted development of the right side of her face. Her face was narrow with a large chin. However, as her later life and frequent pregnancies showed, she was of overall good health.Duczmal (2012), p. 152 In 1447, Frederick III proposed to marry Elisabeth to Charles, son of Philip the Good, Duke of Burgundy. Philip had purchased Luxembourg from Elisabeth of Bohemia. Frederick III offered 70,000 ducats, as the dowry of Elisabeth, in exchange for Luxembourg, but Philip demanded 120,000 ducats and the negotiations fell through.Duczmal (2012), p. 150 For unknown reasons, Elisabeth's scheduled wedding to Frederick of Saxony, negotiated by her mother Queen Elisabeth, did not take place despite a wedding treaty signed in July 1450. After the death of W≈Çadys≈Çaw III of Poland in the Battle of Varna in 1444, Hungarian nobles recognized Elisabeth's brother Ladislaus the Posthumous as their king.Duczmal (2012), p. 147 However, the Emperor refused to allow Ladislaus to leave his court. Political ambitions of Ulrich II, Count of Celje, cousin of Queen Elisabeth, led him to demand the release of the children into his custody. In December 1451, when the Emperor traveled to Rome to be officially crowned as the Holy Roman Emperor, he took Ladislaus with him but left Elisabeth in Vienna. Austrian nobles rebelled against Frederick III and transferred Elisabeth into the care of Ulrich. Elisabeth made a tearful public appeal in a city square calling for help to her and her brother, neglected and held virtual captive by the Emperor.Duczmal (2012), pp. 147‚Äì148 When Frederick III returned in June 1452, Austrian nobles forced him to release Ladislaus to Ulrich in September 1452.Duczmal (2012), p. 148 Polish queen Elizabeth and her husband, Casimir IV of Poland, meeting Saint John of Capistrano Wedding and family life In August 1452, preparing for the Thirteen Years' War (1454‚Äì66) with the Teutonic Knights, the Poles sent an embassy to Vienna to once again negotiate marriage between Elisabeth and now-King Casimir IV of Poland.Duczmal (2012), pp. 150‚Äì151 Ulrich II, Count of Celje, who now had custody of Elisabeth, received the proposal favorably and sent two of his men to Poland. The formal wedding agreement was reached in August 1453 in Wroc≈Çaw in the presence of Polish and Austrian nobles.Duczmal (2012), p. 151 According to the agreement, Elisabeth's dowry, guaranteed by her brother King Ladislaus the Posthumous, was 100,000 Hungarian golden coins. The dowry was secured by lands in Austria, Hungary and Bohemia. In turn, Casimir guaranteed Ko≈Ço, Opoczno, Przedecz as well as a monthly sum of 5,000 golden coins from the Bochnia and Wieliczka Salt Mines. Elisabeth had to renounce her claims to lands of Austrian rulers; the renunciation would not apply if her brother Ladislaus died without a male heir. Elisabeth's dowry was not paid immediately and that gave her the pretext to claim the Hungarian and Bohemian crowns. Eventually, Elisabeth received two-thirds of her dowry ‚Äì it was paid in 1471 and 1472 by Frederick III, Holy Roman Emperor. The third of her dowry secured by lands in Bohemia was forgiven when her son Vladislaus II became King of Bohemia.Duczmal (2012), p. 154 Casimir compensated for the delayed dowry and provided his wife with financial security when in December 1461, after the death of Queen Sophia, he transferred a number of royal lands in Sophia's possessions to Elisabeth, including Korczyn, Wi≈õlica, ≈ªarnowiec, Radom, Jedlnia, Kozienice, Chƒôciny, ≈Åƒôczyca, K≈Çodawa, Pyzdry, Konin, Inowroc≈Çaw. In 1467, she renounced her claim to the Duchy of Luxembourg to Charles the Bold, Duke of Burgundy, whose father had bought the territory in 1443 from Elisabeth, Duchess of Luxembourg.Putnam (1918), p. 53 Elisabeth arrived to Poland in February 1454 with a retinue of nine hundred riders. Reportedly, Casimir was informed that Elisabeth was not an attractive lady and was reconsidering the marriage, but bowed to the pressure of his court.Duczmal (2012), pp. 151‚Äì152 On February 9, Elisabeth arrived to Krak√≥w and was met by Casimir and his mother Sophia of Halshany. The next day, 18-year-old Elisabeth married 27-year-old Casimir and was crowned Queen of Poland.Duczmal (2012), p. 152 Their 38-year marriage was happy and Elisabeth, despite frequent pregnancies, accompanied her husband on almost all travels, including about thirty visits to the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. They would separate infrequently and for short periods of time when Casimir lived on war camps. Their first child, Vladislaus II, was born on 1 March 1456 ‚Äì two years after the wedding.Duczmal (2012), p. 153 She gave birth to seven children in ten years.Duczmal (2012), p. 161 The children received extensive education, which was credited to Elisabeth by Marcin Kromer. Their tutors included Polish priest Jan D≈Çugosz and Italian humanist Filippo Buonaccorsi. Queen Elisabeth had an influence on her husband Casimir, but she did not play a more active role in politics. Instead, Elisabeth was very actively involved in arranging her daughters' marriages. Her influence was particularly evident during the negotiations for the marriage of her daughter Hedwig to George, Duke of Bavaria in December 1474. When Elisabeth's demands exceeded the authority of Bavarian envoys, instead of sending the envoys back to discuss the demands with the Duke of Bavaria, Elisabeth took the responsibility for her demands and wrote a letter to the Duke asking him not to punish the envoys.Duczmal (2012), p. 156 Elisabeth did not arrange her sons' marriages and none of her sons under her influence married young: Casimir (died at age 26) and John Albert (died at age 41) never married, while Sigismund married at 47. Only Alexander, who lived in Lithuania, and Vladislaus, who lived in Bohemia, married while Elisabeth was alive.Duczmal (2012), pp. 162‚Äì163 Struggle for Hungary and Bohemia After the 1457 death of Elisabeth's childless brother, King Ladislaus the Posthumous, she and her family started to advance their claims to the thrones of Bohemia and Hungary. The Poles argued that since Elisabeth's dowry was unpaid, she was entitled to the Hungarian and Bohemian lands. However, the Golden Bull of 1356 did not recognize women's inheritance rights and Hungarian and Bohemian nobles considered their monarchy to be elective, not hereditary. Therefore, they elected Matthias Corvinus and George of Podƒõbrady. Since Poland was engaged in the Thirteen Years' War (1454‚Äì66), King Casimir could not enforce Elisabeth's claims. However, that did not stop political measures. In 1466, Bishop Rudolf of R√ºdesheim informed Elisabeth that Pope Paul II considered George of Podƒõbrady to be a heretic and Elisabeth a rightful heir to the throne of Bohemia.Duczmal (2012), pp. 153‚Äì154 When Matthias Corvinus proposed to Elisabeth's daughter Hedwig in 1468, Elisabeth angrily refused and called Corvinus a 'dog'. A new chapter in Elisabeth's struggle for her inheritance began with the death of Podƒõbrady in 1471, Elisabeth's son Vladislaus II became King of Bohemia.Duczmal (2012), p. 155 At the same time a group of Catholic Bohemian nobles supported Corvinus instead of Vladislaus II. In turn, a group of Hungarian nobles conspired against Corvinus and invited the Polish king to overthrow him. With Bohemia in Vladislaus' hands, King Casimir IV decided to install his son, future Saint Casimir, in Hungary. A Polish army invaded Hungary, but the army was ill-supplied and the short Hungarian campaign was not successful.Duczmal (2012), p. 305 The war in Bohemia continued until the Peace of Olomouc divided Bohemia between Corvinus and Vladislaus II. After the death of Corvinus in April 1490, Casimir and Elisabeth supported their son John I Albert as King of Hungary.Duczmal (2012), p. 157 Hungarian nobles preferred ineffectual Vladislaus II. After Elisabeth's pleas on behalf of John Albert, who reportedly was her favorite, failed to persuade Vladislaus II to abandon the Hungarian crown, a war erupted between the two brothers in June 1490 and lasted until January 1492. John Albert lost and returned to Poland, while Vladislaus II was crowned as King of Hungary. At last, Elisabeth's son ruled both Hungary and Bohemia, except that it was not the son she desired. Hungary and Bohemia were ruled by Vladislaus and his son Louis II of Hungary until 1526. Queen mother King Casimir died on 7 June 1492. Art historians believe that she hired artist Veit Stoss to create Casimir's tomb and recumbent effigy. The Lithuanian throne was already secured by Alexander Jagiellon who acted as his father's regent in Lithuania since 1490. Elisabeth took decisive actions to secure the Polish throne to her favorite son John I Albert ‚Äì she wrote letters to Teutonic Grand Master Johann von Tiefen, her sons Vladislaus II and Alexander campaigning on behalf of John Albert. More importantly, she borrowed 5,675 florins from the Fischel banking family and hired a group of Hungarian soldiers. These soldiers, led by Elisabeth's son Fryderyk, marched to Piotrk√≥w Trybunalski where Polish nobles elected John Albert as their King on 27 August.Duczmal (2012), p. 158 The personal union between Poland and Lithuania was temporarily interrupted. Widowed, Elisabeth led a sedentary life in Krak√≥w in the company of her youngest daughters Barbara and Elisabeth. She was not involved in state politics. Her only known political move during the reign of John Albert was asking the King to support Frederick of Saxony in his quest for the title of Grand Master of the Teutonic Knights. However, she continued to take an active role in family matters. In early 1495, she traveled to Vilnius to attend the wedding of her son Alexander and Helena of Moscow. Elisabeth wanted to convince Helena to convert from Eastern Orthodoxy to Catholicism and to obtain a position for her son Sigismund. She failed in both regards and left Lithuania angered and insulted ‚Äì perhaps because of this dislike she was passive when John Albert suddenly died in 1501 and did not take any more prominent actions to support Alexander as a candidate to the Polish throne.Duczmal (2012), p. 158‚Äì159 In 1496, she arranged the marriage of Barbara to George, Duke of Saxony. Elisabeth was left with only her youngest daughter, also named Elisabeth, as her companion in Krak√≥w. Perhaps with his mother's help Sigismund obtained the Duchy of G≈Çog√≥w from his brother Vladislaus II in 1499. In 1503, she funded a chapel within Wawel Cathedral to house the tomb of her son John Albert by Florentine artist Francesco Fiorentino.Duczmal (2012), p. 159 She also sent a Polish governess to Vladislaus II when he was expecting his first child Anne. Elisabeth opposed the marriage of her youngest daughter Elisabeth to Bogdan III, Voivode of Moldavia.

Mount Diablo Council of the Boy Scouts of America, 17 Cal.4th 670, 952 P.2d 218, 72 Cal.Rptr.2d 410 (1998), was a landmark case which upheld the right of a private organization in California to not allow new members on the basis of their sexual orientation. Its companion case was Randall v. Orange County Council, 17 Cal.4th 736, 952 P.2d 261, 72 Cal.Rptr.2d 453 (1998). Background In 1980, eighteen-year-old Tim Curran, an Eagle Scout, applied to be an assistant Scoutmaster in the Mount Diablo Council Boy Scouts of America. Members of the Boy Scouts of America, however, had recently learned that Curran was gay after reading an Oakland Tribune article on gay youth which featured an interview with Curran. Based on his sexual orientation, the Boy Scouts of America refused to allow Curran to hold a leadership position in their organization. Curran sued in 1981, alleging that the Boy Scouts of America's membership requirements amounted to unlawful discrimination under California's Unruh Civil Rights Act, which required \\"Full and equal accommodations, advantages, facilities, privileges or services in all business establishments\\". Decision This case was ultimately decided in 1998, when the California Supreme Court ruled in favor of the Boy Scouts of America. The court held that because the Boy Scouts of America was not considered a ‚Äúbusiness establishment‚Äù under the Unruh Civil Rights Act, it could not be required to change its membership policies so as to include homosexuals. Psychiatrist and lawyer Richard Green was co-counsel for Curran.

His encouragement prompted Thebes to provoke Sparta into war, beginning the Corinthian War, which dragged on from 395 to 387 BC. The primary aim of Timocrates' mission, which he accomplished, was to force the withdrawal of the Spartan king Agesilaus and his army from Ionia.

He played 12 seasons in Major League Baseball from 1963 to 1974 for the New York Mets, Los Angeles Dodgers, San Francisco Giants, Montreal Expos and the St. Louis Cardinals. He batted and threw right-handed. In Hunt set a single-season record for being hit by more pitches (50) than any player since 1900. Career Hunt broke into the major leagues in as the Mets‚Äô regular second baseman, batting .272 with 10 home runs, which would be his career high, and 42 runs batted in, which he would tie in 1964. That year, he also finished runner-up to Pete Rose for the National League Rookie of the Year honors. In he batted .303 and became the Mets‚Äô first-ever starting All- Star representative, the game being played in Hunt's home ballpark, the newly opened Shea Stadium. He was also an All-Star representative in . In November 1966 Hunt and Jim Hickman were traded to the Los Angeles Dodgers for Tommy Davis and Derrell Griffith.Mets Trade Hunt, Hickman to Dodgers for Tommy Davis, Griffith; Local team gets a clean-up hitter Davis Will Play Left Field-- Hunt's Arrival to Bring Shifts at Los Angeles After batting .263 during the season, Hunt was traded again, this time to the San Francisco Giants in the same deal that sent Tom Haller to Los Angeles. In his first season with the Giants , Hunt batted .250 with two home runs. The second came off Bob Gibson the first inning of the Giants' September 17 game against the St. Louis Cardinals and accounted for the only run in Gaylord Perry's no- hitter. After two more seasons in San Francisco, Hunt was traded to the Montreal Expos. In nearly four seasons in Montreal, he batted .277, including a career high .309 in . Late in the season, the struggling Expos, seeking to turn over their roster, made Hunt the first to go by placing him on waivers. He was claimed by his hometown St. Louis Cardinals, with whom he closed out his career after playing 12 games. The Cardinals brought Hunt to Spring training in 1975, but released him in March. He retired forthwith. In his 12-year career Hunt batted .273 with 39 home runs and 370 RBIs in 1483 games played. He was also one of the most difficult batters to strike out, fanning 382 times in 5235 at-bats, or once in every 13.70 at-bats. In 1973, he set an Expos record by only striking out 19 times in 401 at-bats, the fewest ever in franchise history by a player who had at least 400 at-bats on the season. Hunt hit his last major league home run on September 21, 1971 against the Phillies as a member of the Expos at Jarry Park. He then went 1,302 at-bats and 378 games without hitting another when he closed out his career at the end of the 1974 season. Hit by pitches Hunt, whose motto was, ‚ÄúSome people give their bodies to science; I give mine to baseball,‚Äù was hit by pitches more often than anyone during his playing days. He led the National League in getting hit by pitches in each of his final seven Major League seasons, and the Major Leagues in all but his final season (). He was hit by 25 pitches in , 25 in , 26 in , 50 in , 26 in and 24 in , and 16 in 1974. Hunt said in a July 2000 interview with Baseball Digest that he really began to get hit by pitches after being traded to San Francisco. \\"But,\\" Hunt asked, \\"why would you hit me to face Willie Mays, Willie McCovey and Jim Ray Hart?\\" In , as a member of the Montreal Expos, he set a single-season record for being hit by more pitches (50) than any player since 1900 (Hughie Jennings holds first place, with 51 hit by pitches in 1896). Hunt, who batted right-handed, would stand with his \\"left arm hanging over the plate\\" and allow himself to be hit to make up for his lack of hitting power. On June 25, he was hit three times during a doubleheader. He had the habit of tossing back the ball that had hit him to the pitcher. On September 29, 1971, against the Chicago Cubs at Jarry Park, Hunt was hit by a Milt Pappas pitch to give him 50 on the season, obliterating the post-1900 record of 31 by Steve Evans. Pappas argued to home plate umpire Ken Burkhart that the pitch was directly over the plate, that Hunt got hit by the ball without even trying to get out of the way. Earlier in the year, Pappas had also contributed #27 in the Hunt collection, prompting Cub manager Leo Durocher to cry foul after home plate umpire Augie Donatelli awarded Hunt first base on that pitch. Cincinnati Reds manager Sparky Anderson had a similar complaint after Hunt was hit by a Jim McGlothlin pitch on August 7 of that year; the HBP was Hunt's 32nd of the season, which broke the National League record set by Steve Evans of the St. Louis Cardinals. On April 29, , Hunt tied a Major League record with three HBPs in a game against the Cincinnati Reds. At the time, he was only the fifth player to be hit by a pitch three times in one game. The feat has since been done 17 times as of the end of the 2013 season. Upon his retirement, his 243 HBPs were a career record. Don Baylor would break that record in and retire with 267 HBPs. Craig Biggio would break Baylor‚Äôs career record in and retire at the end of the season with 285 HBPs. Personal life Since 1986, Hunt has operated an instructional baseball camp in Wentzville, Missouri. As of 2018, Hunt has been suffering from Parkinson‚Äôs disease. https://nypost.com/2018/11/15/beloved- mets-hard-nosed-play-has-turned-into-a-hard-life-from-beanings-to-parkinsons/ ReferencesExternal links *Ron Hunt at Baseball Almanac *Ron Hunt at Baseball Library *Ron Hunt's instructional baseball camp *The man who got hit by pitches ESPN, February 10, 2015 Category:1941 births Category:Living people Category:American expatriate baseball players in Canada Category:Austin Senators players Category:Baseball players from Missouri Category:Cedar Rapids Braves players Category:Florida Instructional League Mets players Category:Los Angeles Dodgers players Category:Major League Baseball second basemen Category:McCook Braves players Category:Montreal Expos players Category:National League All-Stars Category:New York Mets players Category:People from Wentzville, Missouri Category:San Francisco Giants players Category:Sportspeople from St. Louis Category:St. Louis Cardinals players ","title":"Ron Hunt"},{"id":"4158535","text":"Nadhr or Nadhir () is an Arabic word that refers to prophets.

MTV Raps hosts Doctor Dr√© and Ed Lover as its two main protagonists and features cameo appearances from some of the top rap/hip-hop acts of the time, including (though not limited to) Busta Rhymes, Bushwick Bill, Guru, Eric B., House of Pain, Ice-T, Kris Kross, Queen Latifah, KRS-One and Run-D.M.C. The film is also the feature film debut of Terrence Howard. Plot Doctor Dr√© and Ed Lover are two bumbling barbers at a Harlem barbershop. Knowing full well that cutting hair is not their calling, their boss, friend, and mentor Nick (Jim Moody) tells the two maybe they should try out for the police academy. They refuse at first, but Nick threatens them with unemployment. Crazily enough, it works out for the two, and they are accepted on the New York City police force. Things seem to be going well for them, when tragedy suddenly strikes, and they lose Nick and the barbershop. Now enforcers of the law, the team decides to investigate the incident, which they believe to be a murder. Ed and Dre find out through the streets that a crooked land developer named Demetrius (Richard Bright) might have had something to do with their friend's death, and proceed to attempt to dig up as much dirt on him as possible. This proves to be difficult, however, when they've got an angry Sergeant (Denis Leary), a moody detective (Rozwill Young), and a bunch of unwilling street hoods (Guru, Ice-T) to go through to get the information they need. Though there aren't any certain clues to be found, strange happenings are certainly going on, as the cops found out that Demetrius' company seems to be looking for oil rather than looking for property. With their superiors not believing Ed And Dre's story and getting themselves in trouble, they end up being suspended. However, they get a lead to a warehouse where they find a lot of guns. They have enough evidence to arrest Demetrius, but Demetrius didn't kill Nick. It was revealed that Nick's friend, Lionel, who was working for Demetrius had murdered him because Nick refused to sell his shop. Ed and Dre have Lionel arrested. Ed and Dre are offered their jobs back, but decided to quit, stating it's too violent for them. When they return to their old barbershop they discover oil coming from the floor. Soon after, they're back in business re-opening the place giving customers bad haircuts.

Uncle Styopa (), also known as Dyadya Stepa, is a series of poems written by Russian children's poet Sergey Mikhalkov. They were written in trochaic tetrameter. The poems featured a brave and noble militsioner (a policeman) who was unusual due to his extreme height. The name of the protagonist of the series was Stepan Stepanov (), or Styopa, which is a diminutive of the Russian given name Stepan. He performed various acts of good will, such as rescuing people, preventing train crashes, helping firefighters, stopping a school bully or working as a police officer for the Soviet Militsiya. Styopa is a wise, brave, generous, noble, fun-loving character. He fights against injustice and serves as an inspiration to the pioneers. It was largely due to this set of poems, among others written during the 1930s in the Soviet Union, that Mikhalkov achieved fame and garnered admiration from the Soviet population. His popularity was phenomenal. Uncle Styopa's face was almost instantly associated with the face of the author. Sergey Mikhalkov himself looked like a tall athlete, and the first illustrators of the poem pictured Uncle Styopa with Mikhalkov's face. More than 250 million copies of the poems have been sold.  Publication  The first poem Uncle Styopa was published in the 7th issue of The Pioneer magazine in 1935. It introduced the character of Stepan Stepanov. In 1936 the poem was included in Sergey Mikhalkov's first collection of poems. The same year it was published as a single volume by Detizdat, with illustrations by A. Kanevsky. Boris Galanov wrote that Sergey Mikhalkov initially showed the poem to Samuil Marshak, who approved of it and inspired Mikhalkov to continue working on the series, and it was the only reason that Mikhalkov didn't think of Uncle Styopa a passing episode in his career.Galanov B. Sergei Mikhalkov, M., 1972, p. 7 The next poem Uncle Styopa The Militsioner () was released in 1954. It was published in the 20th issue of The Pogranichnik, and in Pionerskaya Pravda (as of 10 December 1954), illustrated by E. Shcheglov. It was also published in the 12 December issues of the magazines Novy Mir and The Pioneer illustrated by V. Suteev. In 1955 it was released as a single volume by Detgiz with the illustrations of G. Mazurin. In the preface to The Pioneer's edition Mikhalkov revealed that he decided to come back to the character after 19 years because of an accidental meeting with some police officer in Moscow: \\"Fifteen years ago I got my driver's license and since then I've been a driver. Once, while driving on the street in Moscow, I committed a traffic offence. I stopped my car in the wrong place, at the footpath. I was approached by a police officer. Imagine my surprise when I saw my \\"uncle Styopa\\" in the uniform. The officer was very tall, the tallest of all the officers I have seen in my life! Very politely, in a civilized manner, Uncle Styopa asked me to show my driver's license and never to violate rules of the road again. I apologized and promised to be careful next time. We got into conversation. It turned out that Uncle Styopa served in the Navy before becoming a police officer. I was amazed at this! My Uncle Styopa, the character I wrote about nineteen years ago in a fun poem for the children, served in the Navy too! <‚Ä¶> And now I've decided to write a sequel to my fun little book.\\" The third poem Uncle Styopa and Yegor () was published in Pravda on 27 December 1968. It was released as a single volume by Detskaya Literatura in 1969, with illustrations by Yuvenaliy Korovin. It introduced Styopa's son named Yegor, \\"a new Heracles\\" whose birth weight was 8 kg. In the preface Mikhalkov explained that the idea came to him when he visited the kindergarten to speak in front of the children. He was asked to read Uncle Styopa. After that a boy came up to him and asked if Uncle Styopa had any children. Mikhalkov did not know how to reply, because it was \\"hard to say no\\", and he decided to write about Uncle Styopa's son. The final poem Uncle Styopa The Veteran () was published in Pravda on 1 June 1981, and in the 10th issue of Murzilka (1981). It was released as a single volume by Detskaya Literatura in 1985, with illustrations by Yuvenaliy Korovin.–°. –ú–∏—Ö–∞–ª–∫–æ–≤. ¬´–î—è–¥—è –°—Ç—ë–ø–∞ ‚Äî –≤–µ—Ç–µ—Ä–∞–Ω¬ª –≤ –æ—Ñ–æ—Ä–º–ª–µ–Ω–∏–∏ —Ö—É–¥–æ–∂–Ω–∏–∫–∞ –Æ–≤–µ–Ω–∞–ª–∏—è –ö–æ—Ä–æ–≤–∏–Ω–∞. 1985 Plot Uncle Styopa begins with the description of a \\"gigantic\\" man Stepan (Styopa), nicknamed \\"Fire Tower\\" due to his height. The first part of the poem focuses on Styopa's struggles with his height, e.g. he cannot enjoy shooting galleries in amusement parks because he can easily touch the targets with his hand. He wears 45th size boots and always buys the trousers \\"of previously unheard width\\". He orders double portions for lunch, does not fit into a bed, and has to sit on the floor at the cinema. However Styopa is a kind person and \\"all children's best friend\\". He rescues a drowning boy and saves pigeons from a burning house by reaching for the attic and opening the window. Styopa decides that he has always wanted to serve the country, and joins the Navy. Uncle Styopa ends with his return on shore leave. He tells stories \\"about the war, about the bombings, about the big battleship Marat\\" to the pioneers. Children change his nickname to \\"Lighthouse\\". In Uncle Styopa The Militsioner Styopa, the former Starshina in the Navy, joins the Soviet militsiya, because he thinks that \\"it is important\\". He's respected by adults and children alike. He continues to help people: when a small boy loses his mother at the train station, Styopa lifts the child and he sees his mother in the crowd. When one of the traffic lights breaks down and this creates a traffic jam, the Road Traffic Control Department (ORUD) officer asks for Styopa's advice. Styopa reaches the light with his hand and fixes it. This earns him another nickname, \\"Traffic Light\\". He also earns the first prize in a speed skating competition, making the Militsiya proud. In Uncle Styopa and Yegor Styopa's wife Manya gives birth to a son named Yegor. His birth weight is 8 kg. The poem follows his childhood as he makes first steps, goes to school. Yegor is not as tall as his father, but he is exceptionally strong. He is a model student who gets good marks at school, plays sports, \\"eats soft-boiled eggs for breakfast\\", and prevents arguments among classmates. As he gets older Yegor becomes famous due to his strength. At the age of 20 he wins the European Weightlifting competition and beats the European record by lifting 330 kg. He later wins the gold medal at the Olympic Games. His dream is, however, to \\"fly among the stars\\". In the end of the poem he goes through the astronaut training. In Uncle Styopa The Veteran Styopa is a pensioner. He enjoys life, plays with children, and travels to France to see the Eiffel Tower. His granddaughter (Yegor's daughter) is born. Mikhalkov concludes the poem saying that logically Styopa \\"has to, unfortunately, pass away sooner or later\\", but \\"every reader knows\\" that the character will never get old and die.

Pilots flying the Yak-55 have won several world aerobatic championships.Gunston, 1997 Development The Soviet team in the 1976 World Aerobatic Championship, although dominating the championship, finishing first and second in the individual competition and also winning the team and women's competitions in their Yakovlev Yak-50s,Smith, Flight International, 21 August 1976, pp. 437‚Äì439. were impressed by the performance of competing foreign aircraft, which could carry out the required manoeuvers in less space than the Yak-50. A team in the Yakovlev design bureau, led by Sergei Yakovlev, and with V. P. Kondratiev and D. K. Drach as chief engineers, therefore set out to design an all-new dedicated aerobatic aircraft, unrelated to the Yak-50, which would be able to match the tight, low-speed style of Western aircraft.Gordon, Komissarov and Komissarov 2005, p. 290.Gunston and Gordon 1997, p. 209. The resulting design, the Yakovlev Yak-55, was a single-engined all-metal cantilever monoplane. The aircraft's wing is mounted midway up the fuselage and is of thick, symmetrical section to aid inverted flight. The pilot sits in an enclosed cockpit under a sliding teardrop canopy level with the trailing edge of the wing and with the seat below wing level. The powerplant is the same tractor configuration Vedeneyev M14P engine driving a two-bladed V-530TA-D35 propeller, as used by the Yak-50, while the aircraft has a fixed undercarriage with titanium sprung main gear and tailwheel. The prototype Yak-55 first flew in May 1981, was unveiled at the Moscow Tushino air show in August 1982 and displayed (but did not compete) at the 1982 World Aerobatic Championships. By this time, fashions in aerobatic flying had changed, with the high-energy aerobatics demonstrated by the Yak-50 back in fashion, leading to the Yak-55 being rejected by the Soviet team. The Yak-55 was therefore redesigned with new wings with shorter span, reduced area and a thinner but still symmetrical aerofoil section, giving an increased rate of roll and speed.Gordon, Komissarov and Komissarov 2005, pp. 290‚Äì291. Series production finally began in 1985 at Arsenyev,Gordon, Komissarov and Komissarov 2005, p. 291. with 108 aircraft being delivered by 1991. In the late 1980s, work began on a revised version of the Yak-55, the Yak-55M, to meet demands from DOSAAF for an aircraft with further increased rates of roll, and to compete with new designs from the Sukhoi design bureau. The Yak-55M had a still smaller wing, which resulted in the required improvement in roll rate. It first flew in May 1989, entering production in 1990.Gordon, Komissarov and Komissarov 2005, pp. 291‚Äì292. 106 Yak-55Ms had been built by the end of 1993, with low-rate production continuing.Gunston and Gordon 1998, pp. 209‚Äì210. Operational use The Soviet aerobatic team first used the aircraft in 1984 when they won the World Aerobatic Championship. That same year the Soviet woman's aerobatic team took first place flying the Yak-55, Kh. Makagonova winning individual gold. The aircraft has been relatively free of Service Bulletins and Airworthiness Directives and has proved exceedingly effective in competition at all levels. The obvious capabilities of the aircraft and its success in use, together with the relatively large numbers built (about 250) have meant that owners make relatively few modifications and that few are needed. Variants ;Yak-55 :Prototype/initial production aerobatic aircraft. Long- span wings. ;Yak-55 :Revised production version with reduced wingspan and area. ;Yak-55M :Further revised version, with revised wings. ;Technoavia SP-55M :The SP-55M is a development of the Yak-55M by V.

Power was to have come from a 300 hp VOKBM M-16 8-cylinder x-8 engine driving an AV-16 three-bladed propeller. The prototype was expected to fly in 1992, but delays in producing the engine meant that Yakovlev decided to produce the Yak-54 instead.Gunston and Gordon 2005, p. 210.Gordon, Komissarov and Komissarov 2005, pp. 294‚Äì295.

It is the westernmost of Branford's seven neighborhoods, the others being: The Hill, The Center, Pine Orchard, Stony Creek, Indian Neck, and Brushy Hill. Short Beach's population is approximately 2,500. About a half mile long, it is situated in New Haven County and is bordered by East Haven to the west, Branford to the north and east and Long Island Sound to the south. It is home to many small islands, the largest being Kelsey's Island which has a few small cabins used as summer homes. Short Beach was once a thriving shoreline vacation village that became almost a completely year-round neighborhood starting in the late 1950s. There are still million- dollar summer homes on the waterfront as well as the old vacation homes. Nowadays Short Beach is a fast-growing area that still retains a neighborhood feel. It is home to people of every economic background and is a safe and heavily policed area. Most of the old cottages have been fixed up, so much so that the area has a newer look than it did just ten years ago. There has been immigration to Short Beach and the New Haven area in general from the former Yugoslavia as well as from the Caribbean. Attractions Short Beach is home to half of the famous Shore Line Trolley Museum, which is also in neighboring East Haven, Connecticut. Also in Short Beach are the Yale Corinthian Yacht Club (YCYC), Shore Automotive, the Adult Day Care Center, Short Beach Church, the local fire house, which houses and is owned by Short Beach Hose, Hook and Ladder Volunteer Company 4 of the Branford Fire Department, as well as a U. S. Post Office. Short Beach has three parks, the largest being Pardee Park in the center. Short Beach has a 3-day festival at the end of summer called Short Beach Days with a parade, lip-synching contest, races, basketball, and sand castle building. New Haven CT Transit F3, F5 and F6 buses run through Short Beach connecting the neighborhood to East Haven, New Haven, downtown Branford and go as far as Seymour and Ansonia. Short Beach is known for a population of monk parakeets that live there. It is said that they escaped from captivity and never left the neighborhood. The parrots took up residence in the community's trees and can be heard and seen all year long. History *Short Beach was occupied by the Quinnipiac and possibly the Paugussett tribes in the 17th century but this information is still disputed. *The modern day Short Beach was founded with Branford in 1644 by British colonists. *1920s Short Beach becomes a summer town rivaling many of Rhode Island's beach towns in popularity. *From 1891 until she died in 1919, poet Ella Wheeler Wilcox lived on the Short Beach coast overlooking Granite Bay.\\"A Celebration of Ella Wheeler Wilcox, Poet, Journalist, and Progressive Thinker,\\" Branford Historical Society Environment *Short Beach has a temperate climate and has hot summers and cold winters. *Many oak trees, apple trees, prickly pear, pines and maples grow in the area. *Common animals in the area include monk parakeets, known locally as \\"Short Beach parrots,\\" raccoons, mice, possums, skunks, gulls, pigeons, common terns, ducks, deer, coyotes, bobcats, turkeys and chickens.

Miller and starring Christopher Reeve and Rosanna Arquette. Plot Edgar Anscombe (Christopher Reeve) is an instructor at a US Army Air Corps flying school in 1918. While he is teaching a young pilot, the aircraft crashes during a landing attempt and bursts into flames. The student is killed, though Edgar survives. Ten years later, Edgar is a Contract Air Mail pilot flying the rugged CAM-5 route between Elko, Nevada and Pasco, Washington. When asked to take a passenger, Edgar reluctantly agrees, revealing that the last time he had a passenger in his aircraft, it was the doomed trainee. Tillie Hansen (Rosanna Arquette) is outspoken and rebellious. She makes it clear that she does not want to go to her aunt's house, but her father demands it. He uses his influence as banker for the airline to secure passage for her. Tillie annoys Edgar with her questions, and he acts coldly towards her. During the stopover at Boise, Idaho, Edgar's pilot friend, Jerry Stiller (Scott Wilson) changes the oil lines on the engine, but neglects to inspect his work as a call has just come in for him. The tension between Edgar and Tillie continues to escalate, and when the flight resumes, Edgar decides to take a shortcut over the mountains, deviating from the normal route. However, the engine loses oil pressure and soon fails, causing Edgar to crash land on a remote ridge. Tillie blames Edgar for stranding them, and Edgar calls Tillie a jinx. During the night, Tillie accidentally blows up the remains of the aircraft with a cigarette. Afterward, Edgar's anger subsides as he seems to accept the hopelessness of their situation. The next day, Edgar goes out hunting and manages to shoot a rabbit with his pistol. However, while returning to camp he is attacked by a pack of wolves who steal the rabbit and badly injure his arm. Tillie manages to sew the wound shut and bandages his arm. Faced with the continued threat of the wolves, and since the remains of the aircraft have been destroyed, Edgar and Tillie decide to climb down the cliff to the canyon below. During their descent, a search aircraft flies overhead. Edgar and Tillie jump on a ledge to try to signal the aircraft, but Tillie falls and breaks her leg. The two are forced to spend the night on the cliff face, and a mutual affection develops. The next day, Edgar carries Tillie to the canyon floor, where he makes a travois to haul her. When Tillie spots some telephone lines, Edgar heads off to investigate, leaving Tillie his revolver. Meanwhile, one of the search pilots has determined the location of the crash, and flies toward the crash site. As Edgar returns to the clearing where he has left Tillie, he is again attacked by a wolf, within sight of Tillie. The rescuers fly overhead and spot Edgar, but are powerless to help. Tillie manages to crawl out of her travois and shoots the wolf, saving Edgar's life. They are rescued, with hints of a romantic relationship developing.

Gann.Santoir, Christian. \\"Ernest K. Gann: An adventurer from the sky and the sea (1910-1991).\\" Aeromovies. Retrieved: July 18, 2015. In the book, Tillie is an 11-year-old girl rather than the pert teenager in the film. Also she is critically injured after the crash of the Stearman mailplane and is immobile the entire time afterward. Although set in the northwestern United States, the film was actually shot in Croatia near Rijeka, and Lubiana, Slovenia, then a part of Yugoslavia. Reception Aviation film historian Stephen Pendo noted that aviation films such as The Aviator had a difficult time. The last major feature, Blaze of Noon (1947), also adapted from a Gann novel, that explored the air mail period was mildly successful. \\"While many aspects of aviation have continued to interest filmmakers years after the events have passed, the glamor of flying the mail faded quickly ...\\" and so did interest in this film, concluded Pendo.Pendo 1985, p. 69. Film critic Leonard Maltin's review was succinct, \\"Dull Ernest Gann story barely made it (and understandably so) to theaters.\\"Maltin 2009, p. 71. Famed Chicago critics Gene Siskel and Roger Ebert slammed the film, and when they brought it on their TV show At the Movies, they included the film as a \\"stinker\\" of the week- a rare title reserved for only films they considered awful. Ebert saying that \\"the film takes all the basic cliches from 2 totally different genres and combine them to make one remarkably and almost transcendentally silly movie- it doesn't contain a single ounce of thought\\" and Siskel noting that \\"there isn't a single scene in this movie that is good. Not one. It is uniformly awful and boring.\\"http://siskelandebert.org/video/263ODYOY63WW/Mask--Sylvester--The- Aviator-1985 On Rotten Tomatoes the film has an approval rating of 20% based on reviews from 5 critics.

The standardizers intended to create a new Lisp \\"less encumbered by the past\\" (compared to Common Lisp), and not so minimalist as Scheme. Another objective was to integrate the object-oriented programming paradigm well. It is a third-generation programming language. Origin The language definition process first began in a meeting in 1985 in Paris and took several years. The complete specification and a first implementation (interpreted-only) were made available in 1990.  Distinguishing features  Its main traits are that it is a Lisp-1 (no separate function and variable namespaces), has a Common Lisp Object System (CLOS) style generic-function type object-oriented system named The EuLisp Object System (TELOS) integrated from the ground up, has a built-in module system, and is defined in layers to promote the use of the Lisp on small, embedded hardware and educational machines. It supports continuations, though not as powerfully as Scheme. It has a simple lightweight process mechanism (threads). Summary * A definition in levels, currently Level-0 and Level-1 * Modules based on (non- first-class) lexical environments. * Lexically scoped, with dynamic or late binding available in Level-1. * A single name space for function and variable names (like Scheme). * Lightweight processes. * A fully integrated object system with single inheritance at Level-0 and multiple inheritance and meta- object protocol at Level-1. * An object-oriented condition system. Implementations An early implementation of EuLisp was Free and Eventually Eulisp (FEEL). The successor to FEEL was Youtoo (interpreted and compiled versions), by University of Bath in the United Kingdom. An interpreter for the basic level of EuLisp, level-0, was written by Russell Bradford in XScheme, an implementation of Scheme by David Michael Betz, originally named EuScheme EuScheme but the most recent version is renamed EuXLisp to avoid confusion. Also Eu2C , a EuLisp optimizing compiler, was created by Fraunhofer ISST under the APPLY project in Germany . A dialect of EuLisp was developed, named Plural EuLisp. It was EuLisp with parallel computing programming extensions. Example Example use of classes in the algorithm to solve the \\"Towers of Hanoi\\" problem.

Their debut single, \\"Animal World\\" (March 1978), was released on their own label, Remand Records. A self-titled album appeared in December 1980 but the group disbanded in the following year.  History  The Last Words were an Australian punk rock group formed in Sydney in 1977 by Malcolm Baxter (vocals), Andy Groome (guitar), Mick Smith (bass guitar) and ex-the Saints' Jeffrey Wegener (drums). Baxter, Groome and Smith had been living in suburban, Liverpool when they met Wegener. Wegener left soon after formation and Smith exited before the end of the year. Their debut single, \\"Animal World\\" (March 1978), was recorded by the two remaining members with Baxter on lead vocals and drums and Groome on guitar and bass guitar; and it was co-written by the pair. Note: For additional work user may have to select 'Search again' and then 'Enter a title:' &/or 'Performer:' Australian musicologist, Ian McFarlane, described how, \\"[it] was a poorly recorded, self-produced effort.\\" Baxter and Groome were joined by Ken Doyle (drums) and Leigh Kendall (bass) to re-record \\"Animal World\\", which was re-issued in February 1979 via Wizard Records. Bob Short of Kill Your Pet Puppy, described the label's rationale for signing the group, \\"As glam faded they desperately looked around for their chunk of the next big thing. If you were looking for an unsigned contender, the Last Words ticked off all their boxes. Authentically working class punk with a firm grip on traditional pop sensibility, Wizard rushed them into the studio and did the business properly.\\" The Last Words relocated to London and were signed to Rough Trade Records. Doyle remained in Australia and was replaced by local musician, John Gunn on drums. Rough Trade used the Wizard Records version for another re-issue of \\"Animal World\\", which appeared in the United Kingdom in October 1979. It reached No. 8 in the Alternative Charts. Their next two singles, \\"Today's Kidz\\" (February 1980) and \\"Top Secret\\" (August), were followed by their debut album, The Last Words (December 1980). Although it contained a cover version of Jefferson Airplane's \\"White Rabbit\\" and was produced by Adrian Sherwood; it did nothing to lift the band out of its relative obscurity. The group disbanded with Baxter returning to Australia. In December 1979 Kendall had played guitar on a four-track EP, Punks Are the Old Farts of Today (Rock-O-Rama Records RRR 001) by German punk group, Vomit Visions, which were led by Erik Hysteric ( Erich Knodt). A recording, by Hysteric, of a gig by the Last Words at London University in March 1981, as support to Killing Joke remains unreleased. After the Last Words broke up, Hysteric's backing band, the Esoterics, had Groome on guitar and bass guitar, Kendall on bass guitar, guitar and vocals, and Gunn on vocals. They were joined by Vomit Visions drummer, Dieter Krist, and appeared on Hysteric's album, Drive You Crazy (1981), via Wasted Vinyl Records. It includes the track, \\"Frag Mich Warum\\", which is a German language cover version of the Last Words' \\"Wondering Why\\", and is sung by Kendall. Groome and Kendall also played on three tracks \\"Life\\" (Waste 45), \\"Fool Around\\" and \\"(I Wanna Be A) Kid Forever\\" (Waste 9) recorded before the album, which were released as Eric Hysteric's solo singles in 1982 and 1983.

Early life Butcher was born and raised in London and later relocated with her parents and older sister Jo-Anne. Butcher and her family were relocated in Golden Valley, Derbyshire a small hamlet in the countryside. Her forename is an alternate spelling of Belinda and was chosen by her grandfather. According to Butcher, \\"if I'd been a guy I would have been named Bill, but since I was a girl it became Bilinda\\". During one of his radio shows, BBC Radio 1 disc jockey John Peel once said Butcher was \\"being pretentious and tried to be special by spelling [her] name differently\\". Butcher has said that growing up in Golden Valley was difficult as it was \\"very conservative\\". She has said that she was considered \\"a weirdo\\" as she wore clothes based on 1920s fashion and listened to records on a portable gramophone. Butcher stated: \\"My mother thought I was up in the clouds. I never watched the news or read the papers; it was like I lived in another era. Everybody was into punk and I was living in the [19]20s and [19]30s.\\" At age sixteen, Butcher moved back to London and began studying dance at the Trinity Laban Conservatoire of Music and Dance, but dropped out after nine months due to developing a case of cystitis caused by a chronic urinary infection. She developed a serious liver disease as a result of mistreatment by doctors. After dropping out of Trinity Laban, Butcher worked as a nanny for a French family in London for six months and later moved to Paris for another six months with her partner. The pair moved back to London, squatting in Brixton, and had a child, Toby. Describing the experience, Butcher said: \\"it didn't feel that great to stay in the squat, there was a lot of heroin and it's not ideal that a drug user's needle could sting your baby. Toby's dad was flipping out because of all the acid he took and I just wanted to get away from all the madness. We tried to live together but he was in too bad a state so it didn't work\\". Music career=My Bloody Valentine Butcher was recruited as a vocalist for My Bloody Valentine in April 1987. She replaced original vocalist David Conway and shared vocal duties briefly with Joe Byfield. Butcher, whose prior musical experience was playing classical guitar as a child and singing and playing tambourine \\"with some girlfriends for fun\\", learned that the group needed a backing vocalist from her boyfriend, who had met drummer Colm √ì C√≠os√≥ig on a ferry from the Netherlands. At her audition for the band, she sang \\"The Bargain Store\\", a song from Dolly Parton's 1975 album of the same name. She was chosen as a vocalist ahead of \\"this girl, Julie\\", who was in a relationship with Douglas Hart from The Jesus and Mary Chain. Butcher was featured as co-vocalist and co-guitarist on My Bloody Valentine's non-album single, \\"Strawberry Wine\\", and the band's second mini album, Ecstasy, both of which were released in 1987 on Lazy Records. She performed vocals and guitar on all further My Bloody Valentine releases, until the band's second studio album Loveless (1991)‚Äîon which her guitar duties were performed by co-vocalist and guitarist Kevin Shields. She contributed a third of the lyrics to Isn't Anything (1988) and Loveless, as well as other releases including You Made Me Realise (1988), Glider (1990) and Tremolo (1991). Butcher performing with My Bloody Valentine in 1989 My Bloody Valentine attempted to record a third studio album after signing with Island Records in October 1992 for a reported ¬£250,000 contract. The band's advance went towards the construction of a home studio in Streatham, South London, which was completed in April 1993. Several technical problems with the studio sent the band into \\"semi-meltdown\\", according to Shields, and Butcher left the band in 1997, leading to an indefinite hiatus. My Bloody Valentine reunited in 2007, and released their third album, m b v, in 2013. Collaborations During My Bloody Valentine's hiatus, Butcher collaborated with two major bands. She performed lead vocals on two tracks‚Äî\\"Ballad Night\\" and \\"Casino Kisschase\\"‚Äîon the hip hop band Collapsed Lung's album Cooler (1996), and performed backing vocals on the Dinosaur Jr song \\"I Don't Think\\" from Hand It Over (1997). At Primavera Sound 2013, Butcher performed with The Jesus and Mary Chain, providing vocals on \\"Just Like Honey\\". Artistry Butcher's vocals have been referred to as a trademark of My Bloody Valentine's sound, alongside Kevin Shields' guitar techniques. On a number of occasions during the recording of Isn't Anything, Butcher was awoken and recorded vocals, which she said \\"influenced [her] sound\\" by making them \\"more dreamy and sleepy\\". A similar process was used during the recording of Loveless, on which her vocals have been described as \\"dreamy [and] sensual\\". Explaining the situation, Butcher said: \\"often when we do vocals, it's 7:30 in the morning; I've usually just fallen asleep and have to be woken up to sing ‚Ä¶ I'm usually trying to remember what I've been dreaming about when I'm singing\\". Her singing was originally influenced by Fran√ßoise Hardy and later by Kim Gordon of Sonic Youth. Butcher wrote a third of the lyrics on both Isn't Anything and Loveless but has referred to a lot of the lyrics as \\"plain nonsense\\". According to Butcher, she \\"didn't have a plan and never thought about lyrics until it was time to write them. I just used whatever was in my head for the moment\\". Some of her lyrics were written as a result of attempting to understand rough versions of songs Shields had recorded. Butcher has said: \\"He [Shields] never sang any words on the cassettes I got but I tried to make his sounds into words. It always became my own thing in the end though. And that was the only power I had in the band\\". Like Shields, Butcher uses a number of offset guitars. Her most notable instruments include several Fender electric guitars, including Jaguars, Jazzmasters and Mustangs. On occasion, Butcher uses a Charvel Surfcaster, which she has referred to as her favourite guitar. When performing live, Butcher uses a minimal number of effects pedals and processors. During her adolescence, Butcher became a fan of gothic rock bands such as Bauhaus and Sisters of Mercy, and later post-punk artists, including The Birthday Party, Talking Heads and Joy Division.

It is one of the largest peaceful gatherings in the world. The Ijtema is a prayer meeting spread over three days, during which attending devotees perform daily prayers while listening to scholars reciting and explaining verses from the Quran. It culminates in the Akheri Munajat, or the Concluding Supplication (Final Prayer), Maulana Zubair Ahmed in which millions of devotees raise their hands in front of Allah (God) and pray for world peace. The Ijtema is considered a demonstration of Muslim unity, solidarity, mutual love and respect and an opportunity to reiterate their commitment to Islamic values. The Ijtema is non-political and therefore it draws people of all persuasion. It is attended by devotees from 150 countries. The majority of its devotees come from across Bangladesh, the world's third largest Muslim majority country. Speakers include Islamic scholars from various countries. Bishwa Ijtema is now the second largest Islamic gatherings with 5 million adherents, after the Arba'een Pilgrimage (15-20 Million attendees), surpassing the 2-3 million worshipers that perform the Hajj in Saudi Arabia (which is one of the five pillars of Islam for Muslims). The Bangladeshi Ijtema is a modern event where Muslim participation is voluntary. Etymology Ijtema is an Arabic word which means public gathering. or conference In Bengali, the event is known as the ‡¶¨‡¶ø‡¶∂‡ßç‡¶¨ ‡¶á‡¶ú‡¶§‡ßá‡¶Æ‡¶æ \\"Bishwa Ijtema\\". Bishwa is a Bengali word which means world and Ijtema means Conference. Organization The event is organized in January by the Bangladeshi branch of the Tablighi Jamaat, an orthodox Sunni movement. The congregation takes place in an area which spans over five square kilometers in Tongi, an outer suburb north of Dhaka. An extensive tent is created in the area with the help of the Government of Bangladesh. Transport is provided by state-run companies, including Biman Bangladesh Airlines, the Bangladesh Railway and the Bangladesh Road Transport Corporation (BRTC). The Bangladesh Armed Forces assists by arranging infrastructure. Despite the large number of devotees living within a confined space, generally there are very few problems of sanitation, cooking, and internal movements. It is believed to be possible because of the minimalist approach adopted by the devotees. Devotees reduce their own requirements and develop a respect for others' requirements. During the Final Prayer, huge crowds stretch from the Ijtema ground in Tongi into the Dhaka metropolitan area. Schools and offices are declared closed on the occasion. History The Bengali Tabhlighi Jamaat movement started in Dhaka, East Bengal during the 1950s. The first Ijtemas were organized in Chittagong (1954) and Narayanganj (1958), followed by Ijtemas at the Ramna Race Course in Dhaka in 1960, 1962 and 1965. Due to the increasing rate of participants, the government of East Pakistan allowed organizers to schedule the event annually by the River Turag in 1967. Later, the government of Bangladesh allotted 160 acres Number of devotees In 2001, the number of attendees was 2 million. In 2010, the number was 5 million. Foreign devotees Estimates of foreign devotees stands at 20,000-50,000. They come from various regions, including the South Asian Subcontinent, Russia and Central Asia, Europe, Southeast Asia, the Middle East, North Africa and the United States. Overcrowding and weather Due to increasing overcrowding, the Ijtema was divided into two segments with an interval of seven days from 2010. The first phase is allowed for devotees from 32 designated Bangladeshi districts. The second phase allows devotees from the remaining districts of the country. Foreign devotees are allowed in both phases. Due to increasing overcrowding, the Ijtema was divided into four segments from 2015. The first phase is allowed for devotees from 16 designated Bangladeshi districts. The second phase allows devotees from another 16 designated Bangladeshi districts. Devotees from the remaining 32 districts of the countrywill join next year. In 2008, the event had to be cut short to only one day due to rain and cold weather which left three attendees dead.

They had two surviving daughters: * Margaret of Thuringia (1449 ‚Äì 13 July 1501), who married John II, Elector of Brandenburg, and whose direct main heirs have been Electors of Brandenburg, then Kings of Prussia, and then German Emperors. * Katharina of Thuringia (1453 ‚Äì 10 July 1534), who married Duke Henry II of M√ºnsterberg and who has surviving descendants, mainly among Bohemian high nobility.

It was filmed on location in Portland, Oregon and Yaquina Head near Newport on the Oregon Coast. The film primarily deals with the profound effect of suicide, and how friends and family work their way through the grief.  Plot  David Sinclair (Alan Boyce) seems to have everything. He is smart, talented, funny, and popular. He is best friends with Chris Townsend (Keanu Reeves), a quirky outsider. He seems to have it all together, yet as his personal academic expectations and those of his parents become overwhelming, he seemingly is keeping emotional problems a secret to himself. At a party with his school friends along the coast, he takes a walk to the edge of a cliff overlooking the ocean. Chris, playful as ever, decides to sneak up on his friend, but when he emerges from behind a rock, David is not there. He has fallen to his death. Originally assumed to be a horrible accident, the situation changes when Chris receives a suicide note in the mail. Chris and David's girlfriend, Lauren (Jennifer Rubin), want to hold some type of memorial, but a reluctant school decides against it, leaving the kids to memorialize their friend in their own way.

The film currently holds a 50% rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 14 reviews. Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times praised the film as one of the best 1988 had to offer, stating all the performances were appropriate to the material, whilst also praising Silver for finding authentic ways to portray emotions. Variety Reviews applauded Reeves' performance in the latter half of the film, citing Boyce's character's suicide as the primary reason, although also criticizing the female characters in the film. Rob Gonsalves of efilmcritic.com criticized the film, stating it was nothing more than a 'TV-Movie drama film,' whilst also criticizing the climax of the story. However, he also praised the performance of Keanu Reeves.  Soundtrack  The musical score for Permanent Record was composed by Joe Strummer, former member of the punk rock band The Clash. A soundtrack album was released in 1988 and featured five songs by Joe Strummer and the Latino Rockabilly War with Keanu Reeves guest starring on rhythm guitar for the album's opening track, as well as individual tracks by Lou Reed, The Stranglers, BoDeans, The Godfathers, and J.

There are some one hundred or so species in the genus, mostly shrubs, but also cushion plants and trees, found in New Zealand, Australia and New Caledonia. The name Dracophyllum, meaning dragon-leaf, refers to their strong similarity to the unrelated Dracaena, sometimes known as dragon tree. Although dicotyledonous, they resemble primitive monocots with their slender leaves concentrated in clumps at the ends of the branches; they are sometimes called grass-trees.

The combined institution had 66 branches in the Kingdom. Its international operations consist of a branch each in London, Qatar and Dubai, as well as a subsidiary that has 40 branches across major cities in Pakistan. The company dates back to 1955.Samba: Our History After a partial nationalization program by the Saudi government, Citibank owned a 40% stake in the company in 1980, but sold its remaining interest in 2004. Samba and NCB planned a mega-merger worth 15.3 billion dollars. The merger would result in creation of Persian Gulf's third largest bank after Qatar National Bank and First Abu Dhabi Bank. History Samba, or The Saudi American Bank as it was once known, was established on 12 February 1980 with the takeover of Citibank branches in Jeddah and Riyadh in accordance with a Saudi requirement that forced all foreign banks to be at least 60% owned by Saudi nationals. Citigroup entered a Technical Management Agreement under which it agreed to manage the new bank. The former Prime Minister of Pakistan, Shaukat Aziz, was the Managing Director of the bank in the 1990s. First National City Bank (Citibank) opened its Jeddah branch in 1955, and its Riyadh branch in 1966. Citibank created SAMBA, in which it took a 40% share, to take over its branches in Saudi Arabia, pursuant to a Royal Decree on February 12, 1980. In 1985 SAMBA opened a branch in Istanbul that it closed after 1994, and at one point maintained a subsidiary in Geneva and a representative office in Beirut. In the late 1980s SAMBA opened a branch in London. Speed Cash Services: Samba Financial group is the first in the banking sector to have simplified the process of transferring the money overseas just within hours, Mohd Akhter Alam (General Manager) was the pioneer for these services. Mohd Akhter Alam at the Launch of Speed Cash with Imran Khan In July 1999 SAMBA merged with United Saudi Bank by an exchange of shares, to form one of the largest banks in the Middle East. Before the merger Citibank owned 30 percent of Samba, having sold a 10 percent tranche to two public agencies in 1991. After the merger Citibank was still the largest shareholder with 23 percent of the shares. Kingdom Holding Company (owned by Prince Al-Waleed bin Talal) also had a large share ownership deriving from his ownership in United Saudi Bank. Samba was always the acronym for the Saudi American Bank but the name was changed to Samba Financial Group permanently in 2003 and all references to Saudi American Bank were removed. This name change followed Citibank's decision to pull out of Saudi Arabia and sell its then 20% stake to the General Organisation for Social Insurance. Officially, this was done due to the anticipated relaxation of laws governing foreign banks' operations in the Kingdom. Some speculate that this was due to rising anti-American sentiment in Saudi Arabia. This has become more evident after the change of the Saudi British Bank name as well to SABB in 2006. Nevertheless, SABB is still an HSBC partnership and they have changed their artwork and colors from green and white to the HSBC logo. In 2004, Citibank sold its remaining stake in the company. In March 2007, Samba Financial Group acquired 68% of Crescent Commercial Bank Limited (CCBL) in Pakistan. CCBL, established in 2002, was formerly known as Mashreq Bank Pakistan Limited, which in turn was the result of the merger in 2003 of Crescent Investment Bank Limited and the Pakistan branches of Mashreq Bank psc. CCBL is now named Samba Bank. It currently operates 37 branches across Pakistan; the bank hopes to expand its network of branches in 2018. In June 2008, Samba opened the first integrated branch in Dubai. In 2010, Samba opened the first branch in Doha, Qatar. In August 2011, Samba made the list of top ten safest banks 2011 in the Middle East ranked at number four. In 2017, Rania Mahmoud Nashar was named CEO. This makes Samba the first listed Saudi commercial bank to have a female CEO.

Curry was chief at the time of the assassination of President John F. Kennedy in downtown Dallas on November 22, 1963. Early life Born in Hamilton, Texas, Curry and his family moved to Dallas when he was a few months old. Curry's father served as a police officer in Dallas for a brief period of time before becoming a Baptist minister. Curry attended Dallas Technical High School. He was an all-district tackle and led his high school football team to the state finals against Greenville High School in 1933. He studied optometry for a short time after graduation. During World War II, Curry served for eleven months in the Civilian Pilot Training Program. Law enforcement career Curry joined the Dallas Police Department as a traffic officer on May 1, 1936, and worked his way up the ranks to become the chief of police on January 20, 1960. As Curry explained it to the Warren Commission, he worked his way up in \\"practically every assignment the police department has\\", and graduated from the Northwestern University Traffic Institute in 1945/6 and the FBI National Academy in 1951. Kennedy assassination Dallas Chief of Police Jesse Curry was riding in the lead car of the Presidential motorcade with sheriff James Eric \\"Bill\\" Decker when they turned west off Houston Street onto Elm Street. Looking straight ahead, they noticed \\"a few unauthorized people on the overpass and wondered how they got there.\\" Those people were later described as thirteen railroad men and two policemen who were stationed on the overpass (Triple Underpass) against rules of protocol. After the Presidential motorcade had proceeded a few more yards, Curry heard the first gunshot and immediately shouted over the police radio: \\"Get a man on top of that triple underpass and see what happened up there!\\"Jesse E. Curry, Retired Dallas Police Chief, Jesse Curry Reveals His Personal JFK Assassination File, self-published: Dallas 1969; The Dallas Morning News, pp. 58-59. His words sounded an alarm that something was dreadfully wrong. On April 15, 1964, Warren Commission assistant counsel Leon D. Hubert obtained a deposition from Curry at the US Post Office Building in Dallas. The following week on April 22, Curry, along with other officers of the Dallas Police Department, provided testimony to the Commission in Washington, D.C.. Curry later recounted in his Warren Commission testimony and with the LBJ Presidential Library that as he rode in the lead car of the motorcade carrying President Kennedy, he provided security for both the president and the vice-president, Lyndon B. Johnson, at Parkland Memorial Hospital where President Kennedy died, and, later, aboard Air Force One when Johnson was sworn in as the new president. Two hours after President Kennedy was assassinated, Dallas Police arrested Lee Harvey Oswald in connection with the fatal shooting of Dallas Police officer J.D. Tippit. Oswald quickly became the prime suspect in Kennedy's death and was charged with both crimes. Curry and the Dallas Police were initially praised for apprehending the alleged assassin so quickly, but the praise ended two days later when Oswald was shot by nightclub owner Jack Ruby while he was being transferred from the basement of the Dallas Police station to the county jail. Curry had allowed journalists and camera men into the area to witness the transfer in an effort to quell rumors that Oswald was being mistreated while in police custody. Curry was later criticized and sometimes blamed for compromising Oswald's safety and allowing him to be killed \\"in the basement of his [Curry's] own building.\\" After President Kennedy's assassination, Curry and his family received death and kidnapping threats. Personal life Curry was a member of the St. John's United Methodist Church in Dallas, where he was also a choir member. Two weeks before his death, he was honored as being the oldest member of the congregation. Curry was also a Freemason. Marriages and children Curry was married twice. He and his first wife had a son, Gene (born 1937). They later divorced. Curry then married Bessie \\"Bea\\" Wilhelm with whom he had a daughter, Cathey. They remained married until Curry's death in 1980. Later years and death Due to health issues and on the advice of his doctor, Curry retired from the Dallas Police Department in 1966. In 1969, he wrote a book on the subject of JFK's assassination entitled, Retired Dallas Police Chief, Jesse Curry Reveals His Personal JFK Assassination File.New York State Library, Dallas, 11/22/63: 50 Years Later On November 5, 1969, Curry held a press conference to announce the release of his book said to contain his \\"personal file\\" of the assassination. During the interview, Curry expressed his doubts about the Warren Commission's single bullet theory and their finding of a lone assassin. Curry stated: \\"I'm not sure about it. No one has ever been able to put him (Oswald) in the Texas School Book Depository with a rifle in his hand.\\" Curry reasoned in another interview: \\"I think there's a possibility that one [shot] could have come from in front [of the limousine]. We've never, we've never been able to prove that, but just in my mind and by the direction of his blood and brain from the president from one of the shots, it would just seem that it would have to [have] been fired from the front rather than behind. I can't say that I could swear that I believe that it was one man and one man alone. I think there's a possibility there could have been another man.\\"\\"The Assassination of President Kennedy: What Do We Know Now That We Didn't Know Then?\\" British Broadcasting Corporation. Aired on U.S. TV in 1978 After his retirement, he worked as director of security at the Texas Bank Building until 1976 when he was forced to step down after suffering two heart attacks. For the remainder of his life, Curry worked as a private investigator. Curry suffered from diabetes and survived a stroke in 1978. On June 22, 1980, Curry suffered a fatal heart attack in his sleep at his Dallas home. He was taken to Baylor University Medical Center at Dallas where he was pronounced dead. Curry was 66 years old. His funeral was held at the Ed C. Smith Funeral Chapel on June 25, after which he was buried at Grove Hill Cemetery in Dallas.

Fatimah bint Musa (, '; born 1st Dhu al-Qi'dah 173 AH ‚Äì 10th or 12th of Rabi' al-Thani 201 AH; approximately March 22, 790 CE ‚Äì November 7 or 9, 816 CE), commonly known as Fatimah al-Masumah (, ') was the daughter of the seventh Twelver Shia Imam, Musa al-Kadhim and sister of the eighth Twelver Shia Imams, Ali al-Rida. Every year, thousands of Shia Muslims travel to Qom to honor Fatima Masumeh at her shrine. Fatima Masumeh's character Her brother Imam Ali al-Ridha gave her the title \\"Masumeh\\", which means infallible or sinless. In Shi'ism, women either become saints by their own merits or because they are the sisters, daughters, or wives of other saints. Fatima Masumeh is a saint because of her own holiness and wisdom. She is said to have been learned in various Islamic sciences and the teachings of Muhammad, and to have transmitted many hadiths from her family members. Fatima Masumeh is also a saint because of her closeness to her brother, the 8th Shi'i Imam 'Ali al-Rida and her father, the 7th Shi'i Imam Musa al-Kadhim. Fatima Masumeh is honored in many hadiths, or teachings, from Shi'i Imams that proclaim the benevolence of visiting her shrine in Qom. Her brother Imam 'Ali al-Rida stated that visiting the shrine of Fatima Masumeh is equal to visiting him, demonstrating his honor of his sister. Other Imams declare that anyone who visits Fatima Masumeh's shrine will surely go to heaven. More miracles are reported to occur at her shrine in Qom than at the burial place of any other prophet or imam. History of Fatima Masumeh It is written that even before she was born, Shi'i Imams foretold Fatima Masumeh's holiness and piety. Fatima was born into Shi'i legacy, raised under the care of two Imams - her father and her brother - and she is said to have absorbed their knowledge and holiness. Fatima Masumeh was born in Medina in 173 AH and spent the first six years of her life learning alongside her father, Imam Musa al-Kadhim. Scholars have written that she had a \\"special gift\\" of knowledge and spiritual awareness, even in childhood. When she was ten years old, Harun al-Rashid, the 5th caliph of the Abbasid Caliphate sent her father to prison. This separation was very difficult for Fatima, but her brother 'Ali was 25 years her senior and took care of her. 'Ali and Fatima are among Imam Musa al- Kadhim's 37 children, but they are the only two children from the Imam's marriage to Najmah Khatun. Their mother was a former slave from North Africa who became very learned in Islamic teachings under the guidance of Imam Musa al-Kadim's mother, Lady Hamidah. Ali would later become the 8th Imam and gain the title Imam 'Ali al-Rida. The historian al-Tabari states that 'Al-Rida' means \\"The One Well-pleasing [to God] from the House of Muhammad.\\" He was appointed successor to the Abassid Caliph al-Mamun, though he was hesitant in accepting this role. As 'Ali al-Rida gained the title of \\"Crowned Prince\\" , some people refused to accept his role amidst civil war. 'Ali al-Rida revealed the extent of this revolt to al-Mamun, stating that people considered him(al- mamun) \\"bewitched and mentally deranged,\\" were hiding reports from him, and had given their allegiance to his paternal uncle Ibrahim bint al-Madhi instead of him. In 200 AH, al-Mamun called for 'Ali al-Rida to leave for Khorasan and Fatima Masumeh was forced to live apart from her brother. After one year of separation from her brother, Fatima Masumeh decided to join him. She did not leave solely because of her wish to live near her brother; scholars also suggest that Fatima Masumeh's knowledge and religiosity would help her brother in his political office, especially in decisions regarding women. In 201 AH she set off in a caravan of 23 family and friends of Imam 'Ali al-Rida, alongside another caravan of 12,000 people traveling to Khorasan. The caravans never made it to Khorasan, though, and Fatima Masumeh never reached her brother. They were attacked by agents of the caliph while at Saveh; some fled, but many were wounded, taken prisoner, or killed. Fatima Masumeh survived, but was forced to watch the murders of 23 close family members and friends. It is written that Fatima Masumeh was then poisoned by a woman. Fatima became ill and asked to be taken to Qom, where she died and was buried in her host's land. Birth predictions There are two reports recorded from two different people that Imam Ja\`far al-SƒÅdiq predicted the birth of Fatima. Both predictions mention that she will intercede on behalf of the Shi\` a or help gain admittance to Heaven by visiting her Shrine. These two predictions were also made before her father was born as well, so about 45 years before her birth. Lady Hamƒ´dah was the mother of Fatima‚Äôs father as well as the owner of Fatima‚Äôs mother, Lady Najmah. Lady Hamƒ´dah had a dream that the Prophet told her that Najmah needed to become the wife of her son, so that she could birth ‚Äúthe best people in the world‚Äù. While Hamƒ´dah was more focused on the son, Imam al-RidƒÅ, she would birth Fatima also as a product of the marriage.

Early life William Bramble was the son of J. T. Allen, a famous social activist, and Mary Ryan, a conventional lower-class woman. William had started primary school, yet he was economically unable to finish it. It was the mother who mostly took care of him during those early years; William worked the soil of their poor farm, while learning for trade activities as well.Gallery Montserrat: some prominent people in our history By Howard A. Fergus. Publisher: Canoe Press University of the West Indies. / By the 1920s, William Bramble had joined the Seventh-day Adventist Church, initially as an enthusiastic member, then with a waning participation. In those years, he lived of peddling religious books round Montserrat and Dominica. The British colonial office encouraged lime cultivation on Montserrat in the late 1800s. As demand for the product increased the British established lime farms on Dominica in the early 1900s for which they hired labor from Montserrat and encouraged settlement. In 1930, Bramble married Ann Daly, a strict Adventist instead. They begot five children (P. Austin, Doris, Laurel, Howell, and Olga), of whom the oldest would get into politics as well. For supporting his large family, Bramble had forcibly to start further economic activities; he acquired a small boat and smuggled between the island nations of the Leeward Islands: animals, cooking oil, and vegetables of Montserrat, and salt of Anguilla. Union and party leader In his travels, Bramble became acquainted with the regional efforts for unionism, although he would earnestly start involvement in 1951, when joining the incipient Montserrat Trades and Labor Union (MTLU), in the years of its most virulent actions.:es:Uni√≥n de Trabajadores de Montserrat He challenged Robert Griffith for leadership of the organization and was backed by the influential teacher and unionist, Ellen Peters, who saw him as a man of action with a viable plan for development. Once Bramble gained leadership of the MTLU, he used it as a springboard to propel him into the political arena. William Bramble became a local leader, against the alleged economic oppression of the planter owners and the political rulers; reportedly, by then the agricultural wages were well below the level of subsistence. Hence, Bramble adopted such causes, particularly organizing periodic strike actions; in a speech for the 1952 elections he stated: \\"Listen to me, you landless people, you people, the industrial machinery of this country, arise, and throw off the yoke that binds you like slaves to the Wade Plantation.\\" 1952: winning the free elections Originally, William Bramble had been unable to vote in Montserrat, never fulfilling the requirements of property and income for enfranchisement. In 1952 the country allowed the universal adult suffrage for the first time, and then Bramble capitalized it, forging his own political power since then.A history of organized labor in the English-speaking West Indies By Robert J. Alexander, Eldon M. Parker. Bramble actively participated in the 1952 elections, as the MTLU formed the Montserrat Labour Party, which won all five seats in the Montserrat. Bramble would eventually take the reins of the party. The party went on to win the 1955 and 1958 elections. Bramble found appreciation and support nationally and abroad including England; even the rivaling popular leaders joined the most pragmatic Bramble in his causes against social oppression. However, in 1958 the Malone Commission of Inquiry, which attended labor disputes, accused Bramble, as he would have been attempting just to gain political power for himself through his political actions. During his entire political career from 1952 to 1970, William Bramble would win five general elections, until being defeated by Eustace Dyer. Additionally, in 1958 Bramble won the elections for representative of the short lived Federal Parliament of the West Indies Federation. Regional policies Since early, William Bramble was pledged for rejecting any integration into any of the regional federations of West Indies nations, which were in vogue during those years. Instead, Bramble preferred the conventional financial support of a British colony, manifesting doubts that the so tiny Montserrat might survive as an independent territory; to share the government with the royal authorities it wasn't a practical problem for the national development. Chief Minister=National development William Bramble was invested as the first Chief Minister of Montserrat in 1960 after constitutional changes introduced ministerial government; by then the cotton production was in a decline, as the workers were rather emigrating to United Kingdom. Coping with this situation, he formulated an economic project, with three objectives: the diversification of the exploitation of the rich soil of the country for exporting regionally, the development of the industry of tourism, and the development of a strong offshore banking through taxation exemption. For the development of the tourism, in 1961 William Bramble founded the Montserrat Real State Company, which built about 100 buildings for the foreign tourism. This effectively boosted the national income, forging a new, positive character of the nation which lasted until the eruption of the Soufriere Hills, in the 1990s with the massive destruction of the country. Indeed, until such nefarious event Bramble was regarded as the father of the modern Montserrat. William Bramble also supported the establishment of the powerful Radio Antilles; Bramble had to insist for convincing the British authorities for it, and the powerful station finally started operating in 1963, successfully broadcasting news for the whole Caribbean region. Also for 1963, William Bramble managed negotiating with the British government, so the 12,000 inhabitants of Montserrat got electric supply with affordable fees for the first time; Bramble had pledged the regular acquisition in advance of a determined quote of energy, and so the local plant was granted. Social reforms This occurred with radical social reforms particularly for the poor people, as both his party and his trade union worked almost as a single entity. In particular, William Bramble interceded with the owners of the Wade plantation company, for the development of housing for their workers; initially just within some parcels of that company, then throughout Montserrat, both the employers and their workers helped erecting new neighborhoods. This directly ensued in the formation of a middle class, whose residences have reportedly been of the best ones in Caribbean region. By 1957, William Bramble was expressing concern about the countryside children of Montserrat, whose broad majority was illiterate; by 1969, he instead stated that by his administration all those children were already attending school. Politics During Bramble's tenure, the small Progressive Labour Party functioned as opposition, although it wouldn't ever pose much hindrance to the official policies. The MLP won elections comfortably in 1961 and 1966. It was by 1970 that Bramble and his Montserrat Labour Party faced actual political troubles. Boosting the tourism industry, William Bramble was allegedly too enthusiastic for the building of new establishments either for vacationing or retirement, but the Progressive Democratic Party of his son P. Austin Bramble was opposed to it. People agreed with the latter providing a landslide triumph in the 1970 elections, and so William Henry Bramble lost the Chief Minister's office, while his MLP was left without representatives in the Legislative Council. Still, William Bramble underwent some criticism, particularly about his authoritarian demeanor amongst his intimates. Another source of controversy were the investments of tourism, which allegedly would have removed lands from agricultural projects. Another setback was due to the Canadian Leeward Islands Company Limited, which settled in 1960, eventually exploiting the tomato production almost without economic reward for the locals. Death William Bramble died in 1988; he was the first national figure to have a state funeral and he has the honour of being Montserrat's first National Hero. In 1995, the international airport of Montserrat was renamed, after him.

Stow Marietta L. B. Stow (1830 or 1837Sherilyn Cox Bennion: Equal To The Occasion: Women Editors On The Nineteenth-Century West. University of Nevada Press, 1990, , p. 98 ().‚Äì1902) was an American politician and women's rights activist. Throughout her career in law and politics, Stow advocated for women's suffrage, access to political office, and probate law reform.  Personal life  Marietta Stow grew up in Cleveland, Ohio and worked as a teacher there throughout her early adulthood. Marietta Stow financed her own causes; she lectured about young girls working in dangerous shops and helping the orphaned daughters of Union Soldiers. After getting divorced in her early twenties, she later went on to marry Joseph Stow at the age of thirty-six. Three years later, Marietta Stow went back out into the political realm and became an active suffragette. Nine years before women were granted the right to vote in California, Marietta Stow died of breast cancer in 1902.  Activism for women's rights = San Francisco Women's Suffrage Association  Stow replaced Elizabeth Schenck as president of the San Francisco Women's Suffrage Association after Schenck became sick in 1869. Aiming to widen the support of the movement, Stow called for a meeting in Sacramento to implement a suffrage bill, and she gave lectures in order to raise money for the cause. The organization decided to reject her idea and hold a conference in San Francisco instead, causing Stow to resign from the organization and leave the movement.  Probate law reform  Eight years into their marriage, Stow's husband died on August 11, 1874 at the age of 48. Stow was in Europe at the time of his death and the courts denied her inheritance of $200,000. This sparked her advocacy for probate law reform, which was an area that experienced extensive gender inequality at the time. In regards to probate law, Stow proposed a bill to the legislature of California in 1876 stating that the widow of a spouse would be granted control over their property and putting their affairs in order. Stow also met with attorney Belva Lockwood in Washington D.C. and together they came up with a bill to reform federal marital property and estate laws; they brought it to the House of Representatives in 1879, but it was brushed aside. Stow wrote a book called Probate Confiscation about her belief that women's rights and roles in society involved more than just their positions as wives. In 1879, Stow gave speeches to other women about probate law injustices while writing her book on the side. When the book was finally published, she earned close to one thousand dollars as a result of selling approximately four hundred copies and she promised this money would go towards a college for women.  Career and political office  Stow was nominated by the Greenback Party in 1880 to be the San Francisco School Director. A year after accepting this nomination she formed the Women's Independent Political Party. This new party allowed for women to be further involved in politics and it was a way for them to gain confidence and experience. Stow believed it was vital that women have their own party, but she was still a supporter of the Greenback Party and its candidates. Stow ran for Governor of California in 1882, as the Women's Independent Political Party candidate. She was anti-Chinese, anti-monopoly, and anti-ring, but she was not against whiskey and tobacco. Stow campaigned these views via her own newspaper. The newspaper was also used to promote her ideas and thoughts on the philosophy of positivism, industrial education for women, and the new science of sociology while being actively against the masculinity of the government. Likewise, Stow promoted the usage of birth control, practicing eugenics, shorter work days, and preventing crime.  Vice Presidential candidacy  She and Clara S. Foltz nominated Belva Ann Lockwood for President of the United States, and Stow ultimately supported Lockwood on the National Equal Rights Party ticket as its vice presidential candidate in the 1884 United States presidential election. Stow was the first woman to run for vice president of the United States. The Equal Rights Party platform included equal rights for men and women, a curtailment of the liquor traffic, uniform marriage and divorce laws for the entire nation, and \\"universal peace.\\" Lockwood was also supported the rights of the Chinese, which went against Marietta Stows anti-Chinese agenda. Stow was accused of being outspoken and was notably against the Republican Party at the time and believed it was a dying group. The ticket won some 4,000 votes nationwide. Women's suffrage was its major focus. In 1892 she was a vice presidential candidate again, nominated by the \\"National Woman Suffragists' Nominating Convention\\" on September 21 at Willard's hotel in Boonville, New York presided over by Anna M. Parker, President of the convention. This time Victoria Woodhull was at the top of the ticket. Stow was the editor of Women's Herald of Industry and Social Science Cooperator.

The cipher is designed as a software efficient stream cipher. The authors describe the goal of the cipher to be a more secure version of the SEAL cipher. The general design of Scream is close to the design of SEAL with block cipher-like round functions. There are two versions of Scream. One of them, Scream-F, reuses the S-boxes from the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) block cipher, while the other, Scream, internally generates new, key-dependent S-boxes as part of the initialization phase. The round function is also based on the AES-round function, but is narrower, 64 bits instead of 128 bits. The cipher uses a 128-bit key and a 128-bit nonce. It is efficient in software, running at 4-5 cycles per byte on modern processors. The cipher was presented at the Fast Software Encryption (FSE) conference in 2002.

Etymology The tomb of Manik Pir is located in lane near Maniktala crossing.Cotton, H.E.A., Calcutta Old and New, first published 1909/reprint 1980, Page 800, General Printers and Publishers Pvt. Ltd. Some people say, the neighbourhood is named after Manik Pir. Dargah of Manik Pir Others say, Manik pir (erst: Syed Husen Ud din shah) came from North India on early eighteenth century. But Maniktala, this name is also mentioned in a map of 1784. They says, the bodyguard of Nawab of Bengal Alivardi Khan, Manikchand Bose (erst : Manikram Bose) lives this place as caretaker of Calcutta (Ali Nagar) around from 1756. He was a wise, Compassionate man. That's why he was so popular to all people. From Manikchand this area is called Maniktala. History In 1889, the suburbs of old Calcutta were grouped in four municipalities. Maniktala formed the East Suburban Municipality. In the same year, Maniktala, Ultadanga and Beliaghata became 'fringe area wards' of Kolkata Municipal Corporation.Nair, P.Thankappan, The Growth and Development of Old Calcutta, in Calcutta, the Living City, Vol. I, p. 13, Edited by Sukanta Chaudhuri, Oxford University Press, 1995 edition. The Calcutta Municipal Act of 1923 brought about important changes. The adjacent municipalities of Cossipore, Chitpur, Maniktala and Garden Reach were amalgamated with Kolkata. Garden Reach was later taken out. Geography=Location Today's Maniktala crossing is the intersection of Vivekananda Road (Maniktala Main Road) and Acharya Prafulla Chandra Road (Upper Circular Road) ‚Äî two main thoroughfares in North Kolkata. Beadon Street (Dani Ghosh Sarani/Abhedananda Road), one of the important streets of North Kolkata originates from Maniktala, ending in Nimtala Ghat. Amherst Street also starts nearby (Chaltabagan). Aurobindo Sarani crosses APC Road at Khanna crossing, Maniktala. Maniktala crossing connects Shyambazar, Kankurgachi, Rajabazar and Girish Park to Maniktala.Google maps Police district Manicktala police station is part of the Eastern Suburban division of Kolkata Police. It is located at 20, Canal West Road, Kolkata-700006. Ultadanga Women police station covers all police districts under the jurisdiction of the Eastern Suburban division i.e. Beliaghata, Entally, Maniktala, Narkeldanga, Ultadanga, Tangra and Phoolbagan. Landmarks Gouribari Badridas Jain Temple, Maniktala The Central Blood Bank of West Bengal Government is located at the Maniktala crossing. So is one of oldest markets of Kolkata, the Maniktala Bazar, easily identified by the clock tower. Gouribari Badridas Jain Temple is also located nearby. Economy=Daily markets Harisha Haat, Khanna Cinema Crossing, Maniktala Maniktala market, along with Hatibagan, Sealdah, Lake Market and Gariahat markets, is amongst the largest markets in Kolkata.Bandopadhyay, Raghab, Calcutta‚Äôs Markets, in Calcutta, The Living City Vol II, Edited by Sukanta Chaudhuri, Page 118, First published 1990, 2005 edition, \\"The vintage landmark of the clock tower in Maniktala helps to spot the interiors of this market well.\\" Maniktala is famous for its fish market but is also popular for groceries and fresh vegetables. It is one of the best farmer's markets in Kolkata. Maniktala Market at 187, Vivekananda Road is a private market spread over 3 acres. Vegetables, fruits, betel leaf, flowers, fish, meat, egg etc.are available. Maniktala Municipal Market is located at P-187, C.I.T. Road, Kankurgachi. In Kolkata, every para (neighbourhood) has a machher bazar (fish market), but there are some big fish markets in different areas of the city: Howrah wholesale fish market, Gariahat, Sealdah and Maniktala. These markets \\"are famous not only for the wide variety of fishes they procure but also for their stellar quality. Prices depend on the fish you want. The staple ones are competitively priced. However, the special fishes such as Iilish, Chitol, Chingri can go for some ridiculous pricing. But that‚Äôs no deterrence for the fish lover who can‚Äôt do without it in his lunch!\\" Maniktala market sets a sort of a bench-mark for the pricing. Transport Acharya Prafulla Chandra Road in Maniktala The Maratha Ditch was dug in 1742 and it was partly filled up in 1799 to create the Circular Road (now Acharya Prafulla Chandra Road).Nair, P.Thankappan, The Growth and Development of Old Calcutta, in Calcutta, the Living City, Vol. I, edited by Sukanta Chaudhuri, pages 12-13, Oxford University Press, . The construction of Vivekananda Road, by Calcutta Improvement Trust, was completed in 1928. It was a broad new road through a congested area and changed the complexion of the area. Many buses and auto- rickshaws ply along these roads.Chaudhuri, Sukanta, \\"Traffic and Transport in Calcutta\\", in \\"Calcutta, The Living City\\" Vol II, edited by Sukanta Chaudhuri, Page 151, First published 1990, 2005 edition, Electric tramcars were introduced in Calcutta in 1902.

A new tram line was laid from Maniktala to Ultadanga in 1985.

He was one of five children born to Mexican immigrants to the U.S. state of Arizona Francisco Su√°rez and Carmen Minj√°rez Su√°rez. After high school, he joined the U.S. Navy and served during World War II. In the military, he was stationed off the coast of New Jersey, and also served in Brazil. After the war, he returned to Arizona where he enrolled in the University of Arizona. In 1947, while still an undergraduate, he began writing sketches for Arizona Quarterly magazine. Su√°rez later went on to become a journalist and a college educator, and publishing in Arizona Quarterly. Most of Su√°rez's literature takes place in \\"El Hoyo\\" (The Hole), the name of the Mexican American barrio in Tucson, Arizona, where he was raised. Often overlooked in the \\"canon\\" of Chicano Literature for writers such as Rudolfo Anaya and Rolando Hinojosa-Smith, Mario Su√°rez's writing pre-dates the Chicano literature movement in the '60s and '70s. Many of his sketches of immigrant and working class life were published in the mid- to late-1950s. From an anthropological standpoint, his work should be heralded for telling the immigrant story and documenting life in El Hoyo before its demise. Bibliography *Chicano Sketches: Short Stories.

Golf With Style in Europe, and Swing Golf PangYa in Japan) is a Wii version of the online golf game, PangYa. Gameplay While very similar to the online PangYa, Super Swing Golf is slightly different in the areas of control and content. Both the single player and multiplayer game feature three different modes of play. In single player, these include a story mode, stroke play mode, and match mode, while in multiplayer, Balloon Pop mode replaces the story mode. In all modes, Pang (currency) can be earned and later spent on additional clothing or gear. Players use the Wii Remote to scroll and pan around the course, as well as to actually execute shots. To swing, players raise the controller behind them (as with a real golf club) until the on- screen power meter reaches the desired point. Once ready, players then hold down the \\"A\\" button and swing forward. The angle and speed of the forward swing is used to determine how close the actual shot comes to the desired shot. If the controller is rotated or twisted as the player swings forward, the resulting shot will hook or slice. An alternative control system is to use just the buttons on the Wii Remote similar to how the game is played on the PC, including the same key combinations for power shots. The Wii single-player story mode is named PangYa Festa. Complete with an anime-inspired storyline, the objective of this tournament is to defeat all opponents in match play. Players select a character and then a course, which determines the number of holes, typically 3, 6 or 9, and the opponent. As players successfully defeat opponents, they earn the right to play against more difficult opponents on different courses. Winning a given match also unlocks new characters, caddies, and items which can be purchased in the shop. Before and after each match, the player is greeted with a brief cutscene where the player's character and opponent exchange quips with each other and their caddies. Reception The game was met with positive reception. IGN gave it a score of 7.3 out of 10, calling it a fair game with a lot of replay value, but ultimately the rest depended on preference. Yahoo! Games awarded it 4.5/5, saying it was a fun mix between silly swings and serious golf. X-Play gave it four stars out of five for being fun but very difficult in some areas. GameRankings gave the game a score of 71.40%, while Metacritic gave it 72 out of 100. Sequel A sequel, Super Swing Golf: Season 2, was released on December 11, 2007.

Settled by many German immigrants, it was known in the early 20th century during the Prohibition era for its numerous speakeasies. Bucktown garnered national media headlines as a red-light district and the \\"wickedest city in America.\\" Low culture Bucktown was an area of the city dominated at night by crews and passengers from river boats. It was also settled by many German immigrants, who brought their customs of family entertainment at beer gardens. At the same time, this area attracted \\"adult\\" entertainments. Its racy reputation was based on its dance halls, saloons, and German music pavilions. Some 42 brothels were documented in a two-block area. Jazz and other music of the people was played by the era's finest musicians, including Louis Armstrong from New Orleans and the legendary Bix Beiderbecke.  High culture  Bucktown was also known for its high culture. It was a destination for waves of German immigrants after the Revolutions of 1848. Their customs formed part of the identity of Bucktown and its infusion of the arts into the everyday. Art and music, for the common man, was central to the German way of life. In 1856, immigrants formed the German Strasser Union Marching Band of Davenport. When the Tri City Symphony Orchestra was founded in 1916, it was the twelfth in the nation. As two-thirds of its membership was drawn from the Strasser Marching Band, some scholars believe the orchestra should be considered the oldest music organization in the country. Davenport was built on the arts. Before there were paved streets and running water to homes in the city, there were opera houses with 40-foot domed ceilings. These were destinations for operatic troupes from Chicago who traveled on horseback to perform. The most famous of these was the Burtis Opera House, which still stands on the north side of the Bucktown District. Davenport was home to the nation's first municipal art gallery formed in 1925 by German, Charles Ficke, the foundation of the Davenport Museum of Art, now known as the Figge Art Museum.

It is an ensemble film of kids living in New York City in the aftermath of 9-11, each of them suffering from a sense of doom brought on by dealing with HIV, racism, sexism, class struggle, and general nihilism. The intellectual issues are played out amid an aesthetic of raw ultraviolence that has earned director Matt Pizzolo both accolades and condemnations (such as Film Threat's rave review stating \\"great art should assail the status quo, and that is what Pizzolo and Nisa‚Äôs film has skillfully accomplished\\" in contrast to Montreal Film Journal's scathing review saying the film \\"openly glorifies murderous revolt, literally telling the audience to go out and beat up random people, just because\\").

Summary White, straight edge hardcore kid, Jim (Carlos Puga), and black, hip-hop radical, Fred (Keith Middleton), become friends living on New York's Lower East Side - both of them with the hope that their newfound brotherhood will bring solidarity to their disparate communities. Instead, the alliance triggers a violent race riot that spills into the city streets with devastatingly tragic consequences. Production The film was produced by Kings Mob, a team of neophyte filmmakers in their late teen and early 20s. Director Matt Pizzolo was the eldest member of the crew: 19 years old when he wrote the script and 21 when shooting commenced. Pizzolo met filmmaking partner Katie Nisa at NYU's Tisch School of the Arts. Both were enrolled in the school's Dramatic Writing Program. Pizzolo left the program and lived out of a backpack in Manhattan's Lower East Side while writing the first draft of Threat.Orvis, Ryan. \\"NY Punks Attack Hollywood \\". Entertainment Today.Friedman, Andrew. \\"A Nasty Little Film About Hope\\". Long Island Voice. Still at NYU, Nisa recruited film student Benjamin Brancato to join the project as cinematographer and NYU business school student Carlos Puga to play the lead role. Pizzolo recruited fellow Long Island native Ben Knight who was still a teenager at the time and put him to work as a production designer for the film. Nisa also cast Keith Middleton when she saw him walking on St. Mark's Place. Unknown to Nisa, Middleton was on his way to perform in the popular dance show Stomp.Campion, Chris. \\"Call It A Threat \\". Style Magazine.Williams, Jonathan. \\"Threat \\". Gothic Beauty Magazine. Volume 21, Spring 2006. Kings Mob shot the film in a DIY style that sharply contrasted with other more polished independent films of the mid 90s (sometimes referred to as Indiewood). The DIY style focused less on aesthetic and more on authenticity. This style later picked up traction with various DiY-Video movements including the mumblecore scene of the 2000s. Unlike most movies of the DIY-Video era to follow, Threat was shot on 16mm film. Pizzolo interned at NYC film co-op Film/Video Arts, where he cleaned up after film classes in exchange for free access to cameras and lights while not in use. Nisa waitressed at East Village diner 7A to pay for production supplies that \\"couldn't be borrowed or stolen.\\" Initially, sound recording was to be handled by one of Nisa's film student friends. When he couldn't make it to the first day of production, he instead gave Nisa a 15-minute lesson on how to run the nagra. She went on to be the film's sole sound recordist for the first months of production.Shafer, Marko. \\"Are You A Threat?\\". Buddyhead. At the start of production, the crew consisted solely of Pizzolo, Nisa, Brancato, and Knight but over the course of production it grew to include over 200 young people from 5 different countries.Sweeting, Paul. \\"Lights, Camera, Internet Action\\". Digital Revolution Magazine. Although shot without permits on a shoestring budget by a team of non-professional first-time filmmakers, some critics have compared Threat to such iconic films as The Warriors, Do the Right Thing, American History X, Slacker, Clerks, Romper Stomper, Kids, Doom Generation, and Suburbia. Critical response ranged from \\"easily one of the most important films of the decade\\" to \\"there is no explanation, no logic, and no reckoning.\\" Produced largely in the New York metalcore and hardcore punk scene, Threat features guest appearances by members of Most Precious Blood from the Trustkill Records label. Trustkill also contributed music to the film's score from Most Precious Blood, Bleeding Through, Eighteen Visions, and Terror. Most of the film's score, however, was composed by Alec Empire and his band Atari Teenage Riot. The score was constructed by jungle-music producer queque. In keeping with the punk and DiY ideologies of the movie and their production company, Pizzolo and Nisa eschewed distribution offers from Hollywood studios.Hefflon, Scott. \\"Threat\\". Lollipop Magazine. March 19, 2006. Initially, the film was released as an underground VHS tape and toured across the US and Europe, playing at non-traditional venues such as record stores, hip hop clubs, skateparks, and music festivals. One of the more notable non- traditional screenings took place during the Sundance Film Festival at a Doc Martens shoe store across the street from Sundance's flagship Egyptian Theater. International press for the Sundance screenings launched years of touring which culminated with an appearance at the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival, where music-video distributor HIQI Media signed on to distribute the film to theaters. Soon after, Pizzolo formed the punk rock cinema label HALO 8 Entertainment and released Threat on DVD.Campion, Chris. \\"The Sundance Survivors \\". London Daily Telegraph Saturday Magazine.

It has occasionally been shortened to \\"the Ledge\\". The Alberta Legislature Building is located at 10801 97 Avenue NW. Free tours of the facility are offered throughout the week. The building is also connected via underground walkway to the Grandin LRT Station and Government Centre Transit Centre. Location View from the north. A large plaza and greenspace is situated to the north of the legislative grounds. The building is located on a promontory overlooking the scenic North Saskatchewan River valley near the location of Fort Edmonton, Mark V (1830‚Äì1915), a Hudson's Bay Company fur-trading post, a long- established economic and administrative centre of the western Prairies. It is just up the hill from the archaeological finds at Rossdale Flats to the east, remnants of a long-standing First Nations campsite and location of an earlier Fort Edmonton. The legislature's location was selected shortly after Edmonton was confirmed as the provincial capital by the first session of the Legislature in 1906. The legislature building was located along 97 Avenue. That road was routed through a tunnel during the 1970s renovations to the grounds, allowing a large plaza to connect the legislature to a greenspace to the north. To the west of the building the grounds are bounded by 109 Street and the railway right-of-way coming north from the High Level Bridge, now used by the High Level Bridge Streetcar. Nearby is a walking path, connecting to the Victoria Park and Golf Course and the Grandin neighbourhood. To the north lies the \\"Government Centre\\" district within downtown Edmonton, south of Jasper Avenue, Edmonton's main street. Here are found several provincial government office buildings including the Federal Building. A short section of 108 Street, called \\"Capital Boulevard\\", is anchored by two terminating vistas, the legislature and MacEwan University's City Centre Campus. MacEwan is a part of the Old Canadian National rail yard redevelopment. Nearby to the northeast is the Legislature Annex Building and the Government Centre transit centre, and nearby is also the Rossdale neighbourhood and Edmonton Ballpark. The security of the Legislature building and surrounding grounds are the responsibility of the Alberta Sheriffs Branch. Statues and memorials Several memorials and statues are situated within the Legislative Buildings, or the grounds surrounding it. The fountain inside the Legislature Building was installed during 1959 to commemorate the first visit of Queen Elizabeth II to the building. Also, for the province's centennial, the Queen unveiled in the same structure a series of stained glass windows that highlight the role of the monarchy in Alberta over the previous century. The centre window, at the front entrance of the building, focuses on the reign of Elizabeth II, including her royal cypher surmounted by St. Edward's Crown and flanked by wild roses, while the other windows commemorate the reign of George VI, Edward VIII, George V, and Edward VII, along with provincial emblems such as the coat of arms and the wild rose. Other items of significance on the Alberta Legislative grounds include the Lois Hole Memorial Garden, the statue of Princess Louise, Duchess of Argyll, and a memorial to Chief Crowfoot. History View of the building in 1914, shortly after it was opened. The Alberta Legislature Building was built between 1907 and 1913 in the Beaux Arts style at the same time as the much larger Saskatchewan and Manitoba legislative buildings by architects Allan Merrick Jeffers and Richard Blakey. Montreal architect Percy Nobbs helped with the final revisions. Allan Merrick Jeffers served as the Alberta Provincial Architect from September 1907 to 1910. The Provincial Archives of Alberta holds drawings for virtually all provincial buildings executed under his supervision.http://dictionaryofarchitectsincanada.org/appendix_a Dictionary of Architects in Canada Construction first began in August 1907. The cornerstone was laid by the Governor General of Canada, Albert Grey, 4th Earl Grey, on October 1, 1909. On November 30, 1911, the first session was held in the building. The building was officially opened by Lord Grey's successor, Prince Arthur, Duke of Connaught and Strathearn, on September 3, 1912. Jeffers may have been influenced by the State House of Rhode Island, where he had been a student. The style was associated originally with the √âcole des Beaux-Arts in Paris and was fashionable in North America between 1895 and 1920. The use of Greek, Roman, and Egyptian architectural influences was considered appropriate for a public building, as they suggested power, permanence, and tradition. Beaux-Arts buildings are characterized by a large central dome above a spacious rotunda, a symmetrical T-shaped plan, doors and windows decorated with arches or lintels, and a portico supported by massive columns. The dome has terracotta made by Gibbs and Canning of Tamworth, Staffordshire, England. The building is supported on concrete piles and constructed around a steel skeleton. The first floor is faced with Vancouver Island granite; upper floors feature sandstone from the Glenbow Quarry in Calgary. The interior fittings include imported marble, mahogany, oak, and brass. The building is about in overall height; the project cost over $2 million at the time., The 75th Anniversary of Alberta's Legislative Building. For the centennial of the province of Alberta, stained glass windows with the royal monogram and the emblems of Alberta were installed above from the main entrance of the building. These stained glass windows were unveiled by Queen Elizabeth II on May 24, 2005.http://www.assembly.ab.ca/pub/gdbook/CitizensGuide.pdf References External links  * Alberta Legislature Virtual Visit * Legislative Assembly of Alberta Visitors Information Category:Buildings and structures in Edmonton Category:Legislative buildings in Canada Category:Provincial symbols of Alberta Category:Beaux-Arts architecture in Canada Category:Government buildings completed in 1913 Category:Government buildings with domes Category:Alberta government buildings Category:Tourist attractions in Edmonton Category:Alberta Legislature Category:Terminating vistas in Canada Category:Provincial Historic Resources in Edmonton Category:1913 establishments in Alberta ","title":"Alberta Legislature Building"},{"id":"4159167","title":"Darrell Walker"},{"id":"4159174","text":"The Berekum-Jaman District is a former district that was located in the Brong Ahafo Region of Ghana.

Captain Klutz is a comic strip character created in 1967 by Don Martin. He is a parody of superhero characters. The character originally saw print in a series of original paperback books done for the Mad magazine paperback line, not the magazine itself. Origins Ringo Fonebone was a hopelessly inept boy. He was utterly absorbed in reading comic books, to the point that he was kicked out of his parents' house, as well as a vocational school he tried to attend and a flophouse (the last expulsion left him in nothing but a set of red long johns and dotted boxer shorts). He realized what a mess his life was, and he tried to commit suicide by hanging himself. The towel he used as a rope broke. He fell to earth, inadvertently acquiring a mask (originally a woman's hat being thrown out by her irate husband), and finally crash-landed in the middle of a robbery, in long-johns, his \\"mask\\" and towel \\"cape\\", distracting the robber long enough for the police to capture him. The robber's angry exclamation, \\"Why, you klutz!,\\" was taken by the dazed (and temporarily amnesiac) Ringo as his name, and he responded to the officers' questions regarding his identity with: \\"I'm...a klutz, captain.\\" The police thought he had said he was \\"Captain Klutz.\\" Adventures Captain Klutz did not lead a luxurious life, being reduced to homelessness at various times. (In one adventure, \\"my new airy apartment\\" was a park bench; in another, he hoped an invention would give him super-speed, so he could get a pizza delivery job.) He was also utterly inept at crime-fighting (apparent clumsiness), being poor at deduction, easily misled, and naive. (An alleged \\"kung fu master\\" easily conned Klutz for phony \\"training\\" in martial arts.) He usually succeeded in capturing the bad guy in spite of himself. His main ally was Police Chief O'Freenbean, and he fought a variety of enemies, including: * Sissyman (a villainous mama's boy whose secret headquarters was in his mother's house; his weapons included an ice- cream gun) * Comrade Stupidska * Mervin the Mad Bomber (Captain Klutz tries to lure Mervin out of hiding by calling on a bevy of his loved ones, including family, friends, and the entire Norman Luboff Choir) * Gorgonzola (a giant mechanical spider; Klutz defeats him by grabbing a leg and sticking it into an electrical socket) * The Cackling Cockroach Creators Don Martin illustrated all the Captain Klutz stories.

Salter (January 14, 1896 in Lviv ‚Äì July 23, 1994 in Studio City, Cal.) was an Austrian-American film composer. Biography Salter gained his education from the Vienna Academy of Music, where he studied composition with Alban Berg, Franz Schreker, and others. He worked for the Berlin State Opera before being hired in 1928 to compose music at UFA studios. Salter emigrated to America in 1937 and was quickly put under contract at Universal, where he worked for nearly 30 years, arranging, composing, conducting, and serving as music director. He composed mainly for Universal, most famously for horror and science fiction films but also for other studios and for television. His most celebrated scores include The Wolf Man (1941), Scarlet Street (1945), Creature from the Black Lagoon (1954) and The Incredible Shrinking Man (1957). Salter was nominated for an Academy Award for several films, including Christmas Holiday (1944) and This Love Of Ours (1945). Much of his output for Universal was uncredited, where it was used as stock music, in minor pictures.

Plaid Cymru's victory in the Carmarthen constituency, a seminal moment for Welsh nationalism, was part of a wider process toward Welsh devolution which eventually led to the establishment of the Welsh Assembly in 1999. The election was caused by the death of Labour Party Member of Parliament Megan Lloyd George.

In translation, a source text is the original text that is to be translated into another language. Description In historiography, distinctions are commonly made between three kinds of source texts: Primary Primary sources are firsthand written evidence of history made at the time of the event by someone who was present. They have been described as those sources closest to the origin of the information or idea under study.\\"Library Guides: Primary, secondary and tertiary sources\\" These types of sources have been said to provide researchers with \\"direct, unmediated information about the object of study.\\", citing U.S. Dept. of Labor, Bureau of Labor Statistics (2003), Occupational Outlook Handbook; . Primary sources are sources which, usually, are recorded by someone who participated in, witnessed, or lived through the event. These are also usually authoritative and fundamental documents concerning the subject under consideration. This includes published original accounts, published original works, or published original research. They may contain original research or new information not previously published elsewhere. (\\"A primary source is defined here as a source containing new information authored by the original researcher(s) and not previously published elsewhere.\\"). They have been distinguished from secondary sources, which often cite, comment on, or build upon primary sources.Handlin (1954) 118-246 They serve as an original source of information or new ideas about the topic. Primary and secondary, however, are relative terms, and any given source may be classified as primary or secondary, depending on how it is used. (\\"[T]he distinction is not a sharp one. Since a source is only a source in a specific historical context, the same source object can be both a primary or secondary source according to what it is used for.\\"); (\\"[T]he same document can be a primary or a secondary source depending on the particular analysis the historian is doing\\"); (\\"[A] source may be primary or secondary, depending on what the researcher is looking for.\\"). Physical objects can be primary sources. Secondary and tertiary Secondary sources are written accounts of history based upon the evidence from primary sources. These are sources which, usually, are accounts, works, or research that analyze, assimilate, evaluate, interpret, and/or synthesize primary sources. These are not as authoritative and are supplemental documents concerning the subject under consideration. These documents or people summarize other material, usually primary source material. They are academics, journalists, and other researchers, and the papers and books they produce. This includes published accounts, published works, or published research. For example, a history book drawing upon diary and newspaper records. Tertiary sources are compilations based upon primary and secondary sources.See, e.g. Glossary, Using Information Resources . (\\"Tertiary Source\\" is defined as \\"reference material that synthesizes work already reported in primary or secondary sources\\".) These are sources which, on average, do not fall into the above two levels. They consist of generalized research of a specific subject under consideration. Tertiary sources are analyzed, assimilated, evaluated, interpreted, and/or synthesized from secondary sources, also. These are not authoritative and are just supplemental documents concerning the subject under consideration. These are often meant to present known information in a convenient form with no claim to originality. Common examples are encyclopedias and textbooks. The distinction between primary source and secondary source is standard in historiography, while the distinction between these sources and tertiary sources is more peripheral, and is more relevant to the scholarly research work than to the published content itself. Below are types of sources that most generally, but not absolutely, fall into a certain level. The letters after an item describes generally the type it is (though this can vary pending the exact source). P is for Primary sources, S is for Secondary sources, and T is for Tertiary sources.

According to Jeremy Munday's definition of translation, \\"the process of translation between two different written languages involves the changing of an original written text (the source text or ST) in the original verbal language (the source language or SL) into a written text (the target text or TT) in a different verbal language (the target language or TL)\\". The terms 'source text' and 'target text' are preferred over 'original' and 'translation' because they do not have the same positive vs. negative value judgment. Translation scholars including Eugene Nida and Peter Newmark have represented the different approaches to translation as falling broadly into source-text-oriented or target-text-oriented categories.

Poliszczuk's work has been criticized by several Polish, Canadian, American,Timothy Snyder. (2001). ‚ÄúTo Resolve the Ukrainian Question Once and For All‚Äù: The Ethnic Cleansing of Ukrainians in Poland, 1943-1947 and Ukrainian historians, but also acknowledged for his Polish-Ukrainian reconciliation effort.Magdalena Mazajczyk, Mateusz Raj-Chirowski, \\"Wiktor Poliszczuk po≈õmiertnie udekorowany.\\" Wiktor Poliszczuk posthumously awarded the medal of Polonia Mater Nostra Est. Including photograph of award ceremony at the Warsaw Friendship House, April 16, 2009. ≈öwiatowy Kongres Kresowian, 2009-05-08. Biography Poliszczuk was born in Dubno (then in the Second Polish Republic), into a family of Ukrainian father and Polish mother. He was raised as an Eastern Orthodox Christian. When he was a child Wiktor, his mother and two sisters were deported to Kazakh SSR by the Soviet authorities (in April 1940). His father (an ethnic Ukrainian who had served as government official in interwar Poland) was executed by the Soviets. After World War II his family resettled in Dnipropetrovsk and in 1946 moved to Poland following Polish-Soviet repatriation agreement, to re-unite with the family of his aunt. In Poland Poliszczuk graduated from the Pedagogical Liceum and worked as a teacher. Later he studied law at the Wroc≈Çaw University, and political science at the University of Silesia in Katowice, where he obtained a PhD (his doctoral thesis was about the ideology of Ukrainian nationalism). He worked as an attorney in the People's Republic of Poland. In 1981 during the time of martial law in Poland he emigrated to Canada. He lived in Toronto until his death in November 2008. Work Poliszczuk's research and his extensive writing were devoted to the anatomy of bolshevism, theory and practice of national rights in the former Soviet Union as well as the theory and practice of the Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists and the Ukrainian Insurgent Army activities. His on-line biography does not list any affiliations with a Canadian university. His two books, translated into English-language, were self-published in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, including: Legal and political assessment of the OUN and UPA, as well as Bitter truth : the criminality of the Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists (OUN) and the Ukrainian Insurgent Army (UPA). Wiktor Poliszczuk was the author of over 200 papers, books and scientific publications, scientific articles, polemics, reviews, and press releases written in English, Ukrainian and Polish, including five large volumes bearing the title Integral Ukrainian nationalism as a variant of fascism (Toronto, 2003). His two books were translated into English-language.Viktor Polishchuk library, at WorldCat catalog. In his writing, Poliszczuk clearly separates the issues of the Ukrainian Insurgent Army and the Ukrainian nation, stating that the Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists was based on terror. He explores the sources of the Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists' actions as based on the theories of Dmytro Dontsov. On April 16, 2009, Wiktor Poliszczuk received posthumously the \\"Polonia Mater Nostra Est\\" award. Analysis Poliszczuk's main argument in his work on the history of Ukrainian nationalism was that it began only in the period following World War I. Poliszczuk postulated that the earlier political beliefs held by Ukrainian writers such as Mykola Mikhnovsky were oriented toward independence and did not have the same radical character of Dmytro Dontsov's ideology which served as inspiration for the World War II atrocities committed by the Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists. According to Poliszczuk ‚Äì wrote Dr Anna Dziduszko-Ro≈õciszewska of the Jagiellonian University ‚Äì the main difference among the ideas of Mikhnovsky and Dontsov was the actual definition of a nation. For Mikhnovsky, the reform of the existing social order did not preclude the commitment to the ideal of tolerance, wrote Poliszczuk. For Dontsov, on the other hand, violence and intolerance became the necessary ingredients of the new Ukrainian nationalism providing the vocabulary of motive for the massacres of Poles in Volhynia and Eastern Galicia in the following years. Criticism Wiktor Poliszczuk was criticised as biased against OUN-UPA and nonscientific by several historians. Polish historian Rafa≈Ç Wnuk of the Institute of National Remembrance in Lublin categorized Poliszczuk's work as belonging to the \\"para-scientific\\" tradition. Although Poliszczuk was described by Wnuk as a \\"left-wing democrat\\" (quotes provided by Wnuk), he was said by Wnuk to have used the same jargon and to have reached the same conclusions as the Polish national nonscientific writers. Ukrainian academic Yaroslav Isayevich of the National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine called Poliszczuk an \\"expert practitioner of anti- Ukrainian hysteria.\\" Canadian historian David Marples described Poliszczuk's work as detailed, although taking the form of a polemic similar to the views regarding UPA from the Soviet perspective to which Poliszczuk's work can be added.David R. Marples (2007), Heroes and villains: creating national history in contemporary Ukraine, Central European University Press, pp. 207-208. In an interview published in translation by the Warsaw-based Ukrainian newspaper Our Word (–ù–∞—àe –°–ª–æ–≤–æ), Polish historian Ryszard Torzecki dismissed Poliszczuk as an \\"NKVD prosecutor\\" (which he was not) and one of the named writers unworthy of discussion.Interview in translation reprinted in Svoboda 2001, issue 12, pg. 9 Torzecki: \\" –ù–µ–º–∞—î —Å–µ–Ω—Å—É –≥–æ–≤–æ—Ä–∏—Ç–∏ –ø—Ä–æ –ü—Ä—É—Å–∞. –¶–µ —Å–æ–≤—î—Ç—Å—å–∫–∏–π –∞“ë–µ–Ω—Ç. –ü–æ–¥—ñ–±–Ω–æ —è–∫ –ø—Ä–æ–∫—É—Ä–æ—Ä –ù–ö–í–î –í—ñ–∫—Ç–æ—Ä –ü–æ–ª—ñ—â—É–∫. –¶–µ –ª—é–¥–∏, –Ω–∞ —Ç–µ–º—É —è–∫–∏—Ö –Ω–µ –¥–∏—Å–∫—É—Ç—É—î—Ç—å—Å—è.\\" Ukrainian nationalist historians also condemned Poliszczuk's works. For example, Volodomyr Serhiichuk of Ukraine published an entire book in response to his writing, defending OUN-UPA and claiming the Polish community's alleged collaboration with the Germans and with the Bolsheviks. However, the aforementioned book also \\"denigrates the Poles at every opportunity; it is thus a diatribe ‚Äì wrote Marples ‚Äì rather than an academic work...\\" (Heroes and Villains). Poliszczuk was a \\"left-wing democrat\\" who fully supported Operation Vistula, wrote Rafal Wnuk (referring to the forced deportation of the Ukrainian community from eastern Poland after the assassination of Communist minister Karol ≈öwierczewski there); however, any attempts at his work's classification \\"using a national key\\" (suggested by Motyka) would be the least convincing. Historian of Ukraine Timothy Snyder from Yale wrote that Poliszczuk's argument about the purpose of resettlement was his \\"blatant\\" mistake, because this action was undertaken in order to disperse Ukrainian communities so they \\"could never arise again in Poland\\" according to him. The purported removal of the civilian base from the Ukrainian Insurgent Army after the war was only a pretext used by the authorities in Operation \\"Wisla\\" wrote Snyder.

Plot In late 1960s Melbourne, Errol Wallace (Anthony Hopkins) is a financial business consultant whom we meet in the course of his being hired by the board of Durmack, an automotive component manufacturer, where he assesses a large work force redundancy and recommends major layoffs. Balls, a moccasin factory located in the Melbourne suburb of Spotswood, is his next client. Mr. Ball (Alwyn Kurts), the owner of the company, is affable and treats his employees benevolently. Wallace on a factory tour finds the conditions wanting with shabbiness, old machinery and the workers lackadaisical. A young worker at Balls, Carey (Ben Mendelsohn), who is finding his place in the world and life, is asked by Wallace to assist in his review, compiling worker condition and performance information. Carey is reluctant until he learns that Mr. Ball‚Äôs daughter Cheryl (Rebecca Rigg), whom he fancies, is part of the review staff. Wallace learns that there is an instigator in the midst, his colleague Jerry (John Walton), who leaks the Durmack report, inflating the quantity of sackings as a means to demoralise the union. Kim (Russell Crowe), a salesman at Balls who also has his sights set on the boss's daughter, shows his ruthlessness and ulterior motives when he comes to Wallace's home one night with a complete set of the company financial records that detail non-existent profit for years and reveal that Ball has been selling off company assets to keep the outfit afloat. Wallace realises that whatever productivity improvements have been implemented are not enough to save the company even with an elimination of workers and yet that is his recommendation. Mr. Ball responds, \\"It‚Äôs not just about dollars and cents. It‚Äôs about dignity, treating people with respect.‚Äù Wallace's mind set starts to change when his car is vandalised and some Ball workers come to his aid, workers who then start to include him in their off-hours activities. Mr. Ball announces the work force redundancies and Wallace is clearly uncomfortable seeing them, knowing that it was his recommendation that sealed their fate. The union at Durmack capitulates and management celebrates with a party at which Wallace becomes disenchanted by rash sackings and realises that product diversity can potentially make the company profitable since the skills set is in the workers. Carey realises he has feelings for his work mate and friend Wendy (Toni Collette) and together they climb up onto the roof of the factory and hold hands as they look out over Spotswood.

History Launched in 1993 by EMAP, it was also published under licence in Greece, Denmark, Norway, South Africa, and in France under the name ADDX. After EMAP acquired Petersen in 2000, a United States edition was published based on its existing title MaxSpeed and featuring cars from America and the UK. This ceased publication in 2001 when EMAP sold its U.S. arm to Primedia, but is still in print as Euro Tuner. Former staff members include Fifth Gear presenters Jonny Smith and Vicki Butler-Henderson, who was one of the original staff in 1993.  Criticism  Max Power was criticised for its promotion of unauthorised cruise events. The magazine had a rating system that scored the events in several areas including the size of the police presence, the behaviour and attractiveness of the girls, the number of \\"burnouts\\" performed and the general level of ' Barry ' surrounding the event The magazine also occasionally campaigned against speed cameras and elderly drivers, and despite disclaimers was often criticised for printing articles about dangerous driving on public roads, including drifting and exceeding 200 mph on the A1. Another criticism was related to the large number of half-naked women in the publication, often described as \\"bottom- shelf porn\\". Glamour models who appeared in Max Power included Katie Price, Jakki Degg, Lauren Pope, Lucy Pinder, Michelle Marsh, Amy Green, Chantelle Houghton and Marie Sarantakis. The 2007 relaunch was aimed at reversing this criticism, but glamour shoots were later reintroduced. The perceived laddishness of the magazine meant it was also seen as non-serious by car enthusiasts who wished to focus on the engine/handling modification side of car tuning. However, Max Power was for a long time the biggest-selling motoring magazine in Europe, and was therefore courted by motor manufacturers and auto industry PR teams, who provided them with test cars, exposure to new products, and opportunities for the magazine to cover their brands.  Other ventures  Max Power started the Max Driver advanced driving scheme in 2006 in conjunction with the Institute of Advanced Motorists, Adrian Flux Insurance Services, Honda and Ripspeed. It was designed to provide young, inexperienced drivers professional tuition in handling their cars responsibly. The title also had its own annual modified car show, Max Power Live in the Birmingham NEC. Attendance figures peaked at over 50,000, but it was cancelled from 2007. In the UK, Infogrames PS1 title C3 Racing was named Max Power Racing and branded to match the magazine. In the 2005 election, staff member Dan Anslow stood for the Southend West constituency for the Max Power Party.  Closure  In November 2010, Bauer announced it was suspending the magazine and website. Its circulation had fallen from 237,894, to 20,589, according to the Audit Bureau of Circulations, amid difficult market conditions, including an audience which was increasingly moving online, decreased consumer spending during the 2009 recession and budget cutting. The final monthly magazine was released in January 2011,Max Power ceases publication but Bauer said it \\"intends to keep the Max Power brand alive in the future with a series of \\"one shots\\" and special issues\\". The magazine brought out a special edition of the magazine to mark its production from 1993‚Äì2011.

This acronym is prevalently used in Microsoft environments. For example, the DAL might return a reference to an object (in terms of object-oriented programming) complete with its attributes instead of a row of fields from a database table. This allows the client (or user) modules to be created with a higher level of abstraction. This kind of model could be implemented by creating a class of data access methods that directly reference a corresponding set of database stored procedures. Another implementation could potentially retrieve or write records to or from a file system. The DAL hides this complexity of the underlying data store from the external world. For example, instead of using commands such as insert, delete, and update to access a specific table in a database, a class and a few stored procedures could be created in the database. The procedures would be called from a method inside the class, which would return an object containing the requested values. Or, the insert, delete and update commands could be executed within simple functions like registeruser or loginuser stored within the data access layer. Also, business logic methods from an application can be mapped to the Data Access Layer. So, for example, instead of making a query into a database to fetch all users from several tables the application can call a single method from a DAL which abstracts those database calls. Applications using a data access layer can be either database server dependent or independent. If the data access layer supports multiple database types, the application becomes able to use whatever databases the DAL can talk to. In either circumstance, having a data access layer provides a centralized location for all calls into the database, and thus makes it easier to port the application to other database systems (assuming that 100% of the database interaction is done in the DAL for a given application). Object-Relational Mapping tools provide data layers in this fashion, following the Active Record or Data Mapper patterns. The ORM/active- record model is popular with web frameworks.

Boy Scouts of America, 993 F.2d 1267 (7th Cir. 1993), was a decision by the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit that upheld the right of private organizations to discriminate on the basis of religion when establishing their own membership standards. In 1989, six-year-old Mark Welsh, after receiving a flyer advertising membership, attempted to sign up for Tiger Cubs, the Boy Scouts of America's Scouting program for six- and seven-year- olds. To become a member of the Tiger Cubs, each child must have an \\"Adult Partner\\", typically a parent, who also becomes a member of the organization. Mark's father, Elliott Welsh, an agnostic, informed a BSA official that he did not want to sign the \\"Declaration of Religious Principles\\" section of the adult application. The Boy Scouts of America, therefore, denied Mr. Welsh membership, thereby also denying Mark membership. One year later, when Mark had reached the age of eligibility for Cub Scouts (who do not require Adult partners), he was still denied admission into the Scouting organization as he refused to repeat the phrase \\"to do my duty to God and my country\\" in the Cub Scout Promise. The Welshes sued in 1990, alleging that the defendant organization was a place of public accommodation practicing unlawful religious discrimination under Title II of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. A panel of U.S. District Court judges, Diane Pamela Wood, John Louis Coffey and Walter J. Cummings, Jr. heard the case. On May 17, 1993, the Court ruled against the Welshes in a 2 to 1 decision delivered by Judge Coffey, holding that Boy Scouts of America did not qualify as a place of public accommodation under Title II because it is not an \\"establishment\\" that \\"serves the public,\\" and that the Boy Scouts does not constitute a \\"place of exhibition or entertainment\\" in the sense Congress envisioned when drafting Title II. The majority's opinion was based purely on the statute and did not reach the Constitutional question. Judge Cummings dissented, arguing that because the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, expanded the number of establishments in its definition of \\"places of public accommodation,\\" this court should have expanded Title II to include membership organizations. Judge Cummings explained, \\"My inclination would have been to hold that the Scouts could exclude atheists under a line of freedom of association decisions suggesting that individuals may form groups in the pursuit of political, social, economic, educational, religious and cultural ends.\\" In 1993, the U.S. Court of Appeals upheld the ruling, and the U.S. Supreme Court declined to hear the case.

He supported the polygenist theory of human origins. He was a member of the G√∂ttingen School of History. Biography Chistoph Meiners was born in Warstade (now a part of Hemmoor) near Otterndorf. He started at a gymnasium in Bremen in 1763, and was a student at G√∂ttingen from 1767 to 1770. In 1772 he became extraordinary professor, and in 1775 full professor, of Weltweisheit at the University of G√∂ttingen. From 1788 to 1791 he co-edited the anti-Kantian journal Philosophische Bibliothek. He wrote on comparative history and cultural history. He is now known mostly for his critical attitude towards Immanuel Kant, Mary Wollstonecraft and the concept of Enlightenment. He died in G√∂ttingen. He later became the favorite intellectual ancestor of the Nazis. Polygenism Meiners was a polygenist: he believed that each race had a separate origin. He was a very early practitioner of scientific racism. Meiners studied the physical, mental and moral characteristics of each race, and built a race hierarchy based on the evidence that was considered common in scientific and anthropological circles at the time. Meiners split mankind into two divisions which he labeled the \\"beautiful White race\\" and the \\"ugly Black race\\". In Meiners's book The Outline of History of Mankind he claimed that a main characteristic of race is either beauty or ugliness. He viewed only the white race as beautiful. He considered ugly races as inferior, immoral, and animal-like. He claimed that the black ugly peoples are distinct from the white beautiful peoples by their sad lack of virtue and their terrible vices.Benjamin H. Isaac, The invention of racism in classical antiquity, 2006, p. 105 According to Meiners: > The more intelligent and noble people are by nature, the more adaptable, > sensitive, delicate, and soft is their body; on the other hand, the less > they possess the capacity and disposition towards virtue, the more they lack > adaptability; and not only that, but the less sensitive are their bodies, > the more can they tolerate extreme pain or the rapid alteration of heat and > cold; when they are exposed to illnesses, the more rapid their recovery from > wounds that would be fatal for more sensitive peoples, and the more they can > partake of the worst and most indigestible foods ... without noticeable ill > effects.Tania Das Gupta, Race and Racialization: Essential Readings, 2007, > pp. 25-26 Meiners claimed the Negro felt less pain than any other race and lacked in emotions. Meiners wrote that the Negro had thick nerves and thus was not sensitive like the other races, he went as far to say that the Negro has ‚Äúno human, barely any animal feeling‚Äù he described a story where a Negro was condemned to death by being burned alive, halfway through the burning the Negro asked to smoke a pipe and smoked it like nothing was happening while he continued to be burned alive. Meiners studied the anatomy of the Negro and came to the conclusion that the Negro have bigger teeth and jaws than any other race, as the Negro are all carnivores. Meiners claimed the skull of the Negro was larger but the brain of the Negro was smaller than any other race. Meiners claimed the Negro was the most unhealthy race on earth because of the Negro's poor diet, mode of living and lack of morals he said. Meiners also claimed Native Americans were an inferior stock of people. He claimed that Indians cannot adapt to different climates, different types of food or modes of life and that when they are exposed to these new conditions they lapse into a ‚Äúdeadly melancholy‚Äù. Meiners studied the diet of the Indians and said that they can feed off any kind of ‚Äúfoul offal‚Äù and that they consume huge amounts of alcohol. According to Meiners the Indians are extremely thick as the Spanish conquerors found out when their blades shattered on them. Meiners also claimed the skin of a Native American is thicker than an ox. Meiners wrote that the noblest race was the Celts, and they were able to conquer various parts of the world, were more sensitive to heat and cold and their delicacy is shown by the way they are selective about what they eat. Meiners claimed Slavs are an inferior race, \\"less sensitive and content with eating rough food‚Äù; he described stories of Slavs eating poisonous fungi without coming to any harm. He claimed that their medical techniques were also backwards such as the Slavs baking sick people in ovens then making them roll in the snow. Below the Slavs are the peoples of the Middle East and Asia, all limited in intelligence and of an evil disposition, which goes together with lack of adaptability and insensitivity. In Meiners large work entitled Researches on the variations in human nature (1815), he studied the sexology of each race and claimed that the African Negroids have unduly strong and perverted sex drives, while only white Europeans have it at appropriately lower levels.

He is most noted for his contemporary account of the sack of Thessalonica by the Normans in 1185, for his orations and for his commentaries on Homer, which incorporate many remarks by much earlier researchers.

ŒúŒïŒìŒëŒ£ Œ£Œ•ŒùŒëŒûŒëŒ°ŒôŒ£Œ§ŒóŒ£.  Life  A pupil of Nicholas Kataphloron, Eustathius was appointed to the offices of superintendent of petitions (, epi ton deeseon), professor of rhetoric (), and was ordained a deacon in Constantinople. He was ordained bishop of Myra. Around the year 1178, he was appointed to the archbishopric of Thessalonica, where he remained until his death around 1195/1196. Accounts of his life and work are given in the funeral orations by Euthymius and Michael Choniates (of which manuscripts survive in the Bodleian Library in the University of Oxford). Niketas Choniates (viii.238, x.334) praised him as the most learned man of his age, a judgment which is difficult to dispute. He wrote commentaries on ancient Greek poets, theological treatises, addresses, letters, and an important account of the sack of Thessalonica by William II of Sicily in 1185. Of his works, his commentaries on Homer are the most widely referred to: they display an extensive knowledge of Greek literature from the earliest to the latest times. Other works exhibit impressive character, and oratorical power, which earned him the esteem of the Komnenoi emperors. Politically, Eustathios was a supporter of emperor Manuel I. An original thinker, Eustathios sometimes praised such secular values as military prowess. He decried slavery, and believed in the concept of historical progress of civilization from a primitive to a more advanced state. Works His most important works are the following: * On the Capture of Thessalonica, an eye-witness account of the siege of 1185 and subsequent sufferings of the people of Thessalonica. In early sections of this memoir Eustathios describes also political events at Constantinople from the death of emperor Manuel I through the short reign of Alexios II to the usurpation of Andronikos I, with sharp comments on the activities of all involved. The Greek text was edited by Kyriakidis, with an Italian translation by V. Rotolo; there is an English translation (with a commentary and associated essays) by J. Melville-Jones (Byzantina Australiensia Volume 8), and a German translation by H. Hunger. * A number of orations, some of which have been edited by P. Wirth (Eustathii Thessalonicensis Opera Minora). In 2013 a translation of six of the earliest of these speeches was published with a commentary by Andrew F. Stone (Byzantina Australiensia Volume 19). * Commentaries on Homer's Iliad and Odyssey (). These address questions of grammar, etymology, mythology, history and geography. They are not so much original commentaries as extracts from earlier commentators - there are many correspondences with Homeric scholia. Drawing on numerous extensive works of Alexandrian grammarians and critics and later commentators, they are a very important contribution to Homeric scholarship, not least because some of the works from which Eustathios made extracts are lost. :Although it is likely that Eustathios quotes some authors second-hand, he seems personally acquainted with the works of the greatest ancient critics - Aristarchos of Samothrace, Zenodotos, Aristophanes of Byzantium, and others. This is a great tribute to the state of the libraries of Constantinople and of classical scholarship there in the 12th century. He was also an avid reader of the Deipnosophistae of Athenaeus. Some of the etymological and grammatical comments by Eustathios's Alexandrian predecessors are full of errors; and Eustathios's own comments are diffuse and frequently interrupted by digressions. :The first printed edition, by Majoranus, was published in Rome in 1542-1550 (4 vols., fol.), an inaccurate reprint being later published in Basel in 1559-1560. A. Potitus' edition (Florence, 1730, 3 vols., folio), contains only the commentary on the first five books of the Iliad with a Latin translation. A tolerably correct reprint of the Roman edition was published at Leipzig, the first part containing the Odyssey commentary (2 vols., 4to.), 1825-1826, and the second, containing the Iliad commentary (3 vols., 4to.), edited by J. G. Stallbaum for the Patrologia Graeca, 1827-1829. These were superseded by the edition of M. van der Valk, 1971 onwards. Extracts from the commentaries are quoted in many editions of the Homeric poems. * A commentary on Dionysius Periegetes (dedicated to John Doukas, son of Andronikos Kamateros). This is as diffuse as the commentary on Homer, but includes numerous valuable extracts from earlier writers. (It was first printed in R. Stephens' edition of Dionysius (Paris, 1547, 4to.), and later in that of H. Stephens (Paris, 1577, 4to., and 1697, 8vo.), in Hudson's Geograph. Minor, vol. iv., and lastly, in Bernhardy's edition of Dionysius (Leipzig, 1828, 8vo.).) * A commentary on Pindar. No manuscript of this has come to light; but the introduction survives. (The introduction was first published by Gottlieb Tafel in his Eustathii Thessalonicensis Opuscula (Frankfurt, 1832, 4to.), from which it was reprinted separately by Schneidewin, Eustathii prooemium commentariorum Pindaricorum (G√∂ttingen, 1837, 8vo.). *Other published works. Some were first published by Tafel in the 1832 Opuscula just mentioned, some appeared later, as by P. Wirth for the Corpus Fontium Historiae Byzantinae series. *Unpublished works.

In round 4, he scored his first try against the Auckland Warriors, in what was described as, \\"a two-try, five- star performance,\\" as Western Suburbs won 22-8. He finished the season with 7 tries from 21 games, alternating between centre, wing and bench. He was chosen as a reserve in the qualifying final loss against Cronulla, in what was to be the club's last ever finals appearance. Starting 1997 from the bench, McGuinness showed his versatility by playing centre, five-eighth and hooker at different times during the season. From round 10 he scored 9 tries in 10 games. In the next two years, he played in every game for the Magpies. In what were poor seasons for the club, he managed 21 tries. In 1999, he was the club's leading try-scorer. With the Western Suburbs forming a joint venture with the Balmain Tigers for the 2000 NRL season, McGuinness was a member of the newly formed Wests Tigers. He played in all 24 games, scoring a personal best 14 tries. At the start of 2001, McGuinness scored 5 tries in the first three games. His fortune soon changed when he, along with fellow Tiger, Craig Field, was banned by the NRL for six months after testing positive to illegal substances. After undergoing counselling, McGuinness returned to the NRL two months before the ban was lifted and was back with the first grade team for round 23 against the Newcastle Knights at Campbelltown Stadium, where he scored a try. The Sydney Morning Herald rated McGuinness in the top 34 State of Origin eligible players in 2002, with Roy Masters claiming he was the best player at the Wests Tigers. McGuinness set the record for the most tries scored in a match by a Wests Tigers player on 4 August 2002, when he scored 4 tries against Souths. In 2004, after a season at Manly, McGuinness moved to the Salford City Reds. While at Salford he became a firm fans' favourite, and earned the nickname \\"The Buddha.\\" He left the Salford City Reds at the end of the 2007 season, and though quite a few players left at the end of that year, he in particular, received a standing ovation, with sections of the crowd chanting \\"Buddha, Buddha, Buddha,\\" as a homage to the player. After retiring from the highest level of a football, McGuiness won 2 premierships with Wollongong Wests in the Illawarra competition. In 2011, he joined the Queanbeyan Blues in Canberra's Group 8.

Background Luke Robinson was born in Halifax, West Yorkshire, England. Playing career Luke Robinson signed for Wigan Warriors aged eleven, along with future first teamers Gareth Hock and Sean O'Loughlin. He was a find of Wigan's scout Eric Hawley. Robinson commented later: ‚ÄúEric Hawley, who was the scout at that time, watched me at Siddal ARLFC and asked me if I wanted to come on a trial basis and have a look round and I decided to sign to the chromatids\\", he recalled. ‚ÄúIt was under schoolboy terms, but they were binding to the club and to me. I came over once every two or three weeks for training, basically just to familiarise myself until I was sixteen and could move over.\\" Despite being born in Yorkshire, Luke had supported Wigan Warriors as a kid, his dad taking him to Wembley to watch during the club's glory years. Luke progressed through Wigan's scholarship and Academy systems before making his d√©but for the first team at the age of seventeen during the 2002 Super League season. This year he was also selected to play for England Academy. Luke was an England schoolboys international. He played for the England Academy side who were the first ever to beat the Aussie Schoolboys in December 2002. During 2003, Robinson became a vital part of Wigan's first team squad, often sharing the scrum-half duties with Papua New Guinea star Adrian Lam. Lam picked up a knee injury during a crucial stage of the play-offs that season, leaving Robinson to take sole control the Wigan Warriors pack. Robinson, a supremely confident and exuberant young man, has been likened in style and manner to former Great Britain scrum-half Andy Gregory, and he does admit to sharing the characteristics of brashness and assertiveness famously associated with Gregory. \\"I think every scrum-half has got a bit of something in him,\\" he said. \\"I'm only 5ft 6in and I've got to be bossing Craig Smith, who's 6ft and 17st.\\" Despite the comparisons with Gregory, Luke has been modelling himself on another Wigan Warriors legend in Adrian Lam. \\"I always liked Andy Gregory when I was really young but that was mainly through my dad talking about him,\\" he said. \\"It was Adrian Lam really. You can't say much more about Adrian Lam, can you?\\" However, the England Academy international insists he \\"just wants to be Luke Robinson and be the best I can be.\\" Robinson played for the Wigan Warriors at scrum half back in the 2003 Super League Grand Final which was lost to the Bradford Bulls. Robinson playing for Huddersfield in 2010 He was required again for the first team at the start of 2004 after a further injury to Adrian Lam, however he could not reproduce the form that had helped take Wigan Warriors to the final in the previous season. When Lam recovered Luke was sent on loan to struggling Castleford Tigers. He spent two months at Castleford Tigers before another injury to Lam forced his recall, playing against the Tigers in his first match back at Wigan Warriors. Luke again struggled for form and was eventually allowed to leave Wigan, joining David Hodgson in signing a contract with Salford City Reds. After the deal was done Luke regained the type of form that had created the high hopes for his future, helping Wigan Warriors make it to the 2004 Final Eliminator at Headingley. However, his try was not enough to take the Wigan Warriors to the Grand Final. At the time, many fans were very concerned at the decision to let Luke leave the club. Luke Robinson left Wigan Warriors and signed for the Salford City Reds, and was a regular in the first team at Scrum Half. In 2005 Luke scored eleven tries, seven goals, one field goals totalling fifty-nine points for the Salford City Reds. In 2006 he helped them to their highest ever finish (5th) in the Super League, and the first time the club made it to the play-offs. He signed for Huddersfield Giants in September 2007, following Salford City Reds' relegation from Super League. While at Huddersfield he played for England against the New Zealand MƒÅori at the end of 2010. He played in the 2010 Rugby League Four Nations against New Zealand, Australia and Papua New Guinea games, scoring 2-tries.

The track at the bottom goes to the scenic section of the layout. A fiddle yard or staging yard is a collection of model railway tracks that are hidden from view and allow trains to be stored and manipulated by the operators. These tracks are used to allow most model railways to be operated in a realistic manner. Whilst it is possible to have a realistic shunting yard in view, its operation is generally unreliable with models. Trains can be rearranged by lifting them off the track and replacing them.  Development  Fiddle yards were first built by British modellers so that they could build small layouts and operate them in a realistic manner. The first well-known model railway to use them was 'Maybank', which was exhibited at the 1939 Model Railway Club exhibition in London. This was an urban passenger terminus that led directly into a fiddle yard, hidden beneath a locomotive depot above it. It had an influence on C. J. Freezer, who as editor of Railway Modeller, would later go on to popularise them. In the 1950s he described the \\"Fiddle Yard to Terminus\\" layout, and used it for his influential 'Minories' design. The 'Peter Denny' design of fiddle yard, using a removable 'cassette' of tracks, was developed by the Reverend Peter Denny for his Buckingham Great Central layout around 1952. This used a number of parallel tracks and could also be used for rolling stock storage or transport, off the layout. Some of these cassettes use conventional pointwork, others slide sideways as a traverser, Denny's original rotated around a central pivot. Denny also used it to rotate by half a turn and to reverse the trains wholesale, without needing to uncouple and move locomotives from one end to the other. Denny was noted for his use of non-railway mechanisms and the original was cranked around by a Meccano geared drive, with remote switching and monitoring by a row of sprung metal contacts.  Designs  The fiddle yard is part of a layout, and as such varies with the type layout design, particularly whether it is of the \\"end-to-end\\" or \\"continuous run\\" type. There may be more than one yard per layout. The design also varies by how much the operator wishes to handle the stock‚Äîthey can be completely manual, completely automatic, or somewhere in between. Each design has different space requirements which must be factored into consideration at the design stage. Broadly designs can be into categories: * Fan of points giving many roads can be easily constructed, operated automatically using point motors, and are simple to construct, although turnouts can be expensive, especially if motorised. * Traverser (known as \\"transfer table\\" in the US) where parallel tracks are moved perpendicular to the entrance/exit track(s). In this way each road can be aligned in turn with the entrance/exit track(s). * Turntable, where usually multiple tracks are on the same turntable pivoting around a central point. In this way, entire trains can be turned. Generally only suitable for layouts with shorter trains (i.e. smaller scales). * Sector plate which pivots around a point but unlike a turntable cannot turn completely. Due to geometry, this usually has a single entrance/exit. * Cassette where sections of track within solid bases holding one or more items of rolling stock are moved manually into position. * Elevator, where tracks are moved in a vertical direction. The elevator may itself be storage with multiple decks, or it may be single decked and move stock onto a different level, for example to other storage under the main layout. Combinations of the two above are also possible; for example a sector plate may be combined with a turntable for turning locomotives separately from their trains and allowing for them to be run round. Fiddle yards can also contain a balloon loop for turning entire trains, usually in conjunction with a fan or traverser design.

The organisation has a long history of investigating, monitoring and modelling environmental change, and its science makes a difference in the world. The issues that its science addresses include: air pollution, biodiversity, chemical risks in the environment, extreme weather events, droughts, floods, greenhouse gas emissions, soil health, sustainable agriculture, sustainable ecosystems, water quality, and water resources management. UKCEH is a strategic delivery partner for the Natural Environment Research Council (NERC), part of UK Research and Innovation (UKRI). The institute has four locations: Wallingford (its headquarters), Edinburgh, Lancaster and Bangor. UKCEH is a member of the Partnership for European Environmental Research (PEER). History The Centre for Ecology & Hydrology (CEH) was formally established in March 1994 by Professor John Krebs (now Lord Krebs) the then Chief Executive of NERC. It was formed by the drawing together of four research institutes: the Institute of Hydrology, the Institute of Terrestrial Ecology, the Institute of Freshwater Ecology and the Institute of Virology and Environmental Microbiology. Professor Brian Wilkinson was appointed as the first CEH Director in 1994. He had previously been Director of the Institute of Hydrology and prior to then a Professor of Civil Engineering at Cranfield University. In 1994 CEH had 15 laboratories and field stations across the UK. From 1996 onwards the number of sites was reduced and the Centre now operates from 4 locations across the UK. In the early years there was a need to integrate environmental science across the institutes: joint science programs were established together with an inter-disciplinary science fund. CEH expanded over the next few years & by 1999 there were some 600 staff and about 300 students linked to the universities, with most registered for post-graduate qualification. CEH had global outreach with around 60 worldwide research projects. A new CEH headquarters was constructed on the Wallingford site. On the retirement of Professor Wilkinson in 1999 Professor Mike Roberts was appointed as CEH Director. Professor Roberts was succeeded by Professor Nuttall in 2001. Following UK Government approval in 2019, the Centre for Ecology & Hydrology became autonomous from UK Research and Innovation (UKRI) and the Natural Environment Research Council (NERC), launching as a not-for-profit company limited by guarantee with charitable status on December 1 that year. At the same time, it also changed its name to the UK Centre for Ecology & Hydrology (UKCEH). The current Executive Director of UKCEH is Professor Mark Bailey, who was appointed to the position on a permanent basis in 2012.

Mobile catering for Indian railways A catering truck enables a vendor to sell a larger volume than a cart and to reach a larger market. The service is similar; the truck carries a stock of prepared foods that customers can buy. Ice cream vans are a familiar example of a catering truck in Canada, the United States and United Kingdom. A food truck or mobile kitchen is a modified van with a built-in barbecue grill, deep fryer, or other cooking equipment. It offers more flexibility in the menu since the vendor can prepare food to order as well as fresh foods in advance. A vendor can choose to park the van in one place, as with a cart, or to broaden the business's reach by driving the van to several customer locations. Examples of mobile kitchens include taco trucks on the west coast of the United States, especially Southern California, and fish and chips vans in the United Kingdom. These vehicles are sometimes dysphemistically called \\"roach coaches\\" or \\"ptomaine wagons\\". A concession trailer has preparation equipment like a mobile kitchen, but it cannot move on its own. As such it is suited for events lasting several days, such as travelling funfairs.  Uses  Salvation Army disaster relief truck in April 2006 In addition to being operated as private businesses, mobile catering vehicles are also used after natural disasters to feed people in areas with damaged infrastructure. The Salvation Army has several mobile kitchens that it uses for this purpose. Mobile catering vehicles have also provided a niche for advertisers to target the working population and general audience. With a wide variety of display options, lunch truck advertising has exploded into a successful marketing venture for many companies, including Outdoor Ad Systems, LLC and Roaming Hunger.

The Briggs‚ÄìRauscher oscillating reaction is one of a small number of known oscillating chemical reactions. It is especially well suited for demonstration purposes because of its visually striking colour changes: the freshly prepared colourless solution slowly turns an amber colour, suddenly changing to a very dark blue. This slowly fades to colourless and the process repeats, about ten times in the most popular formulation, before ending as a dark blue liquid smelling strongly of iodine. History The first known homogeneous oscillating chemical reaction, reported by W. C. Bray in 1921, was between hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and iodate () in acidic solution. Because of experimental difficulty, it attracted little attention and was unsuitable as a demonstration. In 1958 Boris Pavlovich Belousov discovered the Belousov- Zhabotinsky reaction (BZ reaction).Belousov, B. P. (1958), \\"A Periodic Reaction and Its Mechanism\\", Sbornik Referatov po Radiatsionni Meditsine, Medgiz, Moscow, p. 145. (transl. in Field and Burger, op. cit., below) The BZ reaction is suitable as a demonstration, but it too met with skepticism, largely because such oscillatory behaviour was unheard of up to that time, until Anatol Zhabotinsky learned of it and in 1964 published his research. In May 1972 a pair of articles in the Journal of Chemical Education brought it to the attention of Thomas Briggs and Warren Rauscher, two science instructors at Galileo High School in San Francisco. They discovered the Briggs-Rauscher oscillating reaction by replacing bromate () in the BZ reaction with iodate and adding hydrogen peroxide. They produced the striking visual demonstration by adding starch indicator. Since then, many other investigators have added to the knowledge and uses of this very unusual reaction. Description=Initial conditions The initial aqueous solution contains hydrogen peroxide, an iodate, divalent manganese (Mn2+) as catalyst, a strong chemically unreactive acid (sulphuric acid (H2SO4) or perchloric acid (HClO4) are good), and an organic compound with an active (\\"enolic\\") hydrogen atom attached to carbon which will slowly reduce free iodine (I2) to iodide (I‚àí). (Malonic acid (CH2(COOH)2) is excellent for that purpose.) Starch is optionally added as an indicator to show the abrupt increase in iodide ion concentration as a sudden change from amber (free iodine) to dark blue (the \\"iodine-starch complex\\", which requires both iodine and iodide.) Recently it has been shown, however, that the starch is not only an indicator for iodine in the reaction. In the presence of starch the number of oscillations is higher and the period times are longer compared to the starch-free mixtures. It was also found that the iodine consumption segment within one period of oscillation is also significantly longer in the starch-containing mixtures. This suggests that the starch probably acts as a reservoir for the iodine and iodide because of the starch-triiodide equilibrium, thereby modifying the kinetics of the steps in which iodine and iodide are involved. The reaction is \\"poisoned\\" by chloride (Cl‚àí) ion, which must therefore be avoided, and will oscillate under a fairly wide range of initial concentrations. For recipes suitable for demonstration purposes, see ShakhashiriShakhashiri, B. Z. (1992) Chemical Demonstrations: A Handbook for Teachers of Chemistry Vol. II pp 248-256, University of Wisconsin Press, Madison, WI. or Preparations in the external links. Terminal conditions The residual mixture contains iodinated malonic acid, inorganic acid, manganous catalysts, unreacted iodate and hydrogen peroxide. After the oscillations cease, the iodomalonic acid decomposes and iodine is produced. The rate of decomposition depends on the conditions. All of the components present in the residual mixture are of environmental concern: Iodate, iodine and hydrogen peroxide are strong oxidants, the acid is corrosive and manganese has been suggested to cause neurological disorders. A simple method has been developed employing thiosulfate and carbonate ‚Äì two inexpensive salts ‚Äì to remove all oxidants, neutralize the acidity and recover the manganous ion in the form of manganese dioxide. Behaviour in time Video of Briggs‚ÄìRauscher reaction The reaction shows recurring periodic changes, both gradual and sudden, which are visible: slow changes in the intensity of colour, interrupted by abrupt changes in hue. This demonstrates that a complex combination of slow and fast reactions are taking place simultaneously. For example, following the iodide ion concentration with a silver/silver iodide electrode (see Videos) shows sudden dramatic swings of several orders of magnitude separated by slower variations. This is shown by the oscillogram above. Oscillations persist over a wide range of temperatures. Higher temperatures make everything happen faster, with some qualitative change observable (see Effect of temperature). Stirring the solution throughout the reaction is helpful for sharp colour changes; otherwise spatial variations may develop (see Videos). Bubbles of free oxygen are evolved throughout, and in most cases, the final state is rich in free iodine Variants=Changing the initial concentrations As noted above, the reaction will oscillate in a fairly wide range of initial concentrations of the reactants. For oscillometric demonstrations, more cycles are obtained in dilute solutions, which produce weaker colour changes. See for example the graph, which shows more than 40 cycles in 8 minutes. Changing the organic substrate Malonic acid has been replaced by other suitable organic molecules, such as acetone (CH3COCH3) or acetylacetone (CH3COCH2COCH3, pentane-2,4-dione). More exotic substrates have been used. The resulting oscillographic records often show distinctive features, for example as reported by Szalai. Continuous flow reactors The reaction may be made to oscillate indefinitely by using a continuous flow stirred tank reactor (CSTR), in which the starting reagents are continuously introduced and excess fluid is drawn. Two dimensional phase space plots By omitting the starch and monitoring the concentration of I2 photometrically, (i.e., measuring the absorption of a suitable light beam through the solution) while simultaneously monitoring the concentration of iodide ion with an iodide-selective electrode, a distorted spiral XY-plot will result. In a continuous-flow reactor, this becomes a closed loop (limit cycle). Fluorescent demonstration By replacing the starch with a fluorescent dye, Weinberg and Muyskens (2007) produced a demonstration visible in darkness under UV illumination. Use as a biological assay The reaction has been proposed as an assay procedure for antioxidants in foodstuffs. The sample to be tested is added at the onset of oscillations, stopping the action for a period proportional to its antioxidant activity. Compared to existing assay methods, this procedure is quick and easy and operates at the pH of the human stomach. For a detailed description suitable for high school chemistry, see Preparations. In contrast to the findings referring predominantly to polyphenolic compounds reported in the above cited literature, it was found that the salicylic acid ‚Äì a simple monophenolic compound ‚Äì did not stop the oscillations immediately after it was added into the active Briggs-Rauscher mixture. In the low concentration interval the salicyclic acid only damped the oscillations, while in higher concentrations the damping effect was much stronger and complete inhibition was also observed. Sulfosalicylic acid, a derivative of salicyclic acid, practically did not affect the oscillations. Chemical mechanism The detailed mechanism of this reaction is quite complex.Furrow, S. D. in Field, R. J. and M. Burger(1985), Oscillations and Traveling Waves in Chemical Systems, J. Wiley & Sons, New York. Nevertheless, a good general explanation can be given. For best results, and to prevent side reactions that may interfere with the main reaction, the solutions are best prepared a short time before the reaction. If left undisturbed, or exposed to ultra-violet radiation the reactants can decompose or react with themselves, interfering with the process. The essential features of the system depend on two key processes (These processes each involve many reactions working together): * A (\\"non- radical process\\"): The slow consumption of free iodine by the malonic acid substrate in the presence of iodate. This process involves the intermediate production of iodide ion. * B (\\"radical process\\"): A fast auto-catalytic process involving manganese and free radical intermediates, which converts hydrogen peroxide and iodate to free iodine and oxygen. This process also can consume iodide up to a limiting rate. But process B can operate only at low concentrations of iodide, creating a feedback loop as follows: Initially, iodide is low and process B generates free iodine, which gradually accumulates. Meanwhile, process A slowly generates the intermediate iodide ion out of the free iodine at an increasing rate proportional to its (i.e. I2) concentration. At a certain point, this overwhelms process B, stopping the production of more free iodine, which is still being consumed by process A. Thus, eventually the concentration of free iodine (and thus iodide) falls low enough for process B to start up again and the cycle repeats as long as the original reactants hold out. The overall result of both processes is (again, approximately): : + 2 H2O2 \\\\+ CH2(COOH)2 \\\\+ H+ ‚Üí ICH(COOH)2 \\\\+ 2 O2 \\\\+ 3 H2O The colour changes seen during the reaction correspond to the actions of the two processes: the slowly increasing amber colour is due to the production of free iodine by process B. When process B stops, the resulting increase in iodide ion enables the sudden blue starch colour. But since process A is still acting, this slowly fades back to clear. The eventual resumption of process B is invisible, but can be revealed by the use of a suitable electrode. A negative feedback loop which includes a delay (mediated here by process A) is a general mechanism for producing oscillations in many physical systems, but is very rare in nonbiological homogeneous chemical systems. (The BZ oscillating reaction has a somewhat similar feedback loop.)

Nick Ward was the heavyweight champion of England for four months in 1841. His first recorded fight was in 1835 against Harry John Lockyer. In 1840 he fought his brother's old enemy James Burke; Burke was a feared and dangerous fighter, who had killed one opponent, the champion Simon Byrne. Following the match Jem Ward had refused to fight Burke, would not hand over the championship belt or acknowledge Burke as the heavyweight champion, even after he was acquitted of murder. Nick Ward won the bout against Burke when his gang of supporters forced the referee to disqualify Burke for an alleged foul. This winning pattern was repeated when in February 1841 Ward became heavyweight champion. He beat Ben Caunt, the reigning champion, when Caunt was disqualified, after the referee succumbed to pressure from the crowd claiming Caunt hit Ward while he was down. In May of the same year Caunt legitimately beat Ward and regained his title. At this time boxing was governed by the less than arduous London Prize Ring rules. The more strict and fair Queensbury rules were not implemented until much later in the century. Nick Ward is today considered a \\"mediocre\\" boxer, known for using \\"unfair tactics\\" and avoiding head on fighting. However, in spite of his reputation for underhand fighting he was considered a good counter puncher.Nick Ward Ward died in Soho, London in 1850 aged 38.

The area, which is mainly upland, is now in Powys. During the Middle Ages it was part of the region known as Rhwng Gwy a Hafren () and its administrative centre was at Cefnllys Castle.  History =Early history According to historic manuscripts, the region between the Wye and the Severn was once regarded as a unit. Manuscripts use various alternative spellings for this, such as Ferlix, Fferllys, Fferleg, and Fferreg; in his Hanes Cymru, the historian John Davies argued, based on these alternatives, that it was probably named Fferyllwg, and that the name may refer to ironworkers (Fferyll in Welsh). Welsh tradition (as reported for example by the 1844 Topographical Dictionary of Wales), claims that Ferlix was part of the realm of King Caradoc (more usually associated with Gwent), but on his death, the realm was divided between his sons; Cawdraf received Ferlix, while Meurig received the rest of the realm, as Gwent. In any case, manuscripts give Tangwydd ap Tegid, an 8th-century ruler of Ferlix, the following pedigree: *Cawrdaf ap Caradoc *Caw ap Cawrdaf *Gloyw ap Caw *Hoyw ap Gloyw *Cynfarch ap Hoyw *Cyndegg ap Cynfarch *Teithwalch ap Cyndegg *Tegid ap Teithwalch *Tangwydd ap Tegid Welsh annals claim that during the reign of Tangwydd's father, Tegid, the Mercians seized parts of Ferlix, by constructing Offa's Dyke through it. For unclear reasons, Tangwydd also became ruler of Brycheiniog, which lay adjacent to Ferlix; Elisse ap Rhain, the previous king of Brycheiniog, only had daughters, so it is possible that Tangwydd obtained Brycheiniog by marriage. Hwgan, Tangwydd's son and successor, attempted to invade Mercia, while King Edward the Elder was distracted by the Viking invasion; Hwgan, however, hadn't reckoned with Edward's sister, √Üthelfl√¶d, who lead an army against him. √Üthelfl√¶d defeated Hwgan, in battle, then invaded his lands, captured Hwgan's castle (in Brycheiniog). and took his wife prisoner.Togographical History of Wales, Brecknockshire Hwgan decided to form an alliance with the Vikings, but died soon after, while defending Derby (at the time held by the Vikings) from the Saxons. New dynasties Hwgan having been an aggressor against the Saxons, his son Dryffin was forced by King Athelstan to pay tribute, and deposed from Ferlix by Elystan Glodrydd, Athelstan's god-son (and namesake), who took added Ferlix to his existing realm of Buellt; Dryffin and his heirs would now only rule in Brycheiniog. Elystan was succeeded by his son, Cadwgan, who was succeeded by his eldest son, Idnerth; a younger son gave rise to the Cadogan family, who were raised to the nobility many centuries later. Due to their allegiances to the Saxon Kings, once the Normans invaded England, many Welsh princes had assisted anti- Norman revolts like that of Eadric the Wild. Hence, in 1080, when a revolt broke out in Northern England, the Normans pre-emptively occupied Wales, to prevent any further Welsh assistance to the Saxons. In turn, this led to a Welsh revolt in 1094, but by the end of the century it was successfully suppressed by a number of Norman magnates; the northern parts of Ferlix were conquered by Ranulph de Mortimer.Davies, N.The Isles: A History (), 1999, p. 281 He founded the castles of Dinieithon (near present Llandrindod Wells) and Cymaron (between Llanbister and Llangunllo). Ranulph's daughter (Hawise) had married Stephen of Aumale, the cousin of William Rufus, the King. In 1095, Ranulph took part in an unsuccessful conspiracy to replace the king with his son-in-law, and was consequently exiled. Idnerth was able to recover his lands in northern Ferlix; he reached agreement with Philip de Braose, the conqueror of southern Ferlix, to regain most of the remainder, but had to consent to Braose retaining Buellt and the area around New Radnor. Idnerth passed his lands to his son, Madog, but when Madog died, in 1140, Ferlix was divided between Madog's sons. The exile of Ranulph and his family had continued throughout this time, due to supporting a rival of William's brother (and successor) Henry (namely, Robert Curthose the Duke of Normandy).Barlow, p. 324 After Henry's death, in 1135, Ranulph's family had supported the successful invasion of England by Stephen of Blois, and were able to return. In 1142, once forces loyal to Empress Matilda (the legitimate heir of King Henry) managed to capture Stephen, and Stephen's partisans began to abandon his cause, Hugh de Mortimer (grandson of Ranulph) invaded northern Ferlix, killing Hywel and Cadwgan, sons of Madog, in the process. In 1144, Hugh repaired Cymaron Castle, and from this base, two years later, he invaded the south of Ferlix, leading to the death of Maredudd, another of Madog's sons. After 1148, Matilda's son, Henry, gradually weakened Stephen's position, and eventually was acknowledged his heir; in 1155 Henry became king. During this period, Henry's growing political strength enabled him to force Hugh to surrender his Welsh castles. The two remaining sons of Madog had by now re-divided Ferlix between them; Cadwallon received the northern half, which became Maelienydd, while his brother, Einion Clud, ruled the southern half, which became Elfael. In 1176 Cadwallon founded Cwmhir Abbey. In 1179, Cadwallon visited King Henry II of England (for reasons which do not survive). Upon his return, on 22 September, he was killed by some retainers of Hugh de Mortimer's son, Roger; the king was outraged, and imprisoned Roger for 3 years.  Maelgwn  Maelienydd was inherited by Cadwallon's son, Maelgwn ap Cadwallon (not to be confused with Maelgwn ap Cadwallon of Gwynedd, also known as Maelgwn Gwynedd, who lived centuries before), but King Henry seized Cymaron castle, to use the income from its lands to pay back large debts that Cadwallon owed him.De Excidio et Conquestu Britanniae, Gildas When Roger Mortimer was released, he seized much of Maelienydd, including Cymaron, though Maelgwn was able to recover it with the help of Rhys ap Gruffydd, prince of Deheubarth, his cousin's father-in-law; Maelgwn had opted to become a vassal of Rhys, in order to increase his ability to resist Mortimer. One of the main versions of Welsh law, the Cyfnerth Redaction, is thought to originate from Maelienydd during this time. King Henry was succeeded by Richard the Lionheart, who soon decided to drive forward the Third Crusade. On 5 March 1188, Gerald of Wales visited Ferlix with Baldwin, the Archbishop of Canterbury, seeking soldiers for the Third Crusade; they met Maelgwn at his castle of Crug Eryr (described by Gerald as 'Cruker'), and convinced him to take the cross (i.e. join the crusade) like his cousin Einion o'r Porth (ruler of Elfael and son of Einion Clud) had done a few days earlier.The Itinerary through Wales, Book 1, Chapter 1 ‚Äì Journey through Hereford and Radnor Richard's absence during the crusade allowed Rhys to increase his already great dominance over other Welsh princes, establishing effective hegemony; when Richard returned he was determined to restrain Rhys. Shortly thereafter, the murder of Einion (himself recently returned from Crusade) by Gwalter, his own brother, lead to military intervention by the Sheriff of Hereford (William de Braose); when Rhys opposed this, the king had the excuse he needed to suppress the power of Deheubarth. Local Norman magnates were provided with troops by the king, to invade lands under the sway of Deheubarth; Roger Mortimer was the magnate who attacked Maelienydd, and by 1200 had conquered it. In that year, Roger granted a charter of liberties to Cwmhir Abbey. Maelgwn and his brother, Hywel, found refuge in Gwynedd. Maelgwn died in exile, two years later.  Gwyneddian hegemony  In 1210, Hywel, and Maelgwn's eldest son, Madog, came to an accommodation with Roger Mortimer. However, two years later, they murdered William de Mora, so King John had them executed (by hanging) at Brignorth. Maelgwn's remaining sons ‚Äì Cadwallon and Maredudd ‚Äì inherited the land, and vengefully became vassals of Gwynedd, the dominant state in North Wales, ruled by Llywelyn Fawr. In 1230, Ralph Mortimer, Roger's son and heir, married Llywelyn's daughter. Ten years later, however, following the repudiation of the Treaty of Gwerneigron by Llywelyn's son and successor, Dafydd, Ralph invaded Maelienydd. In 1242, he constructed Cefnllys Castle at the former site of Dineithon. In 1247, the grievances of Gwynedd were settled by the Treaty of Woodstock. Two years later, Maelgwn's grandsons (Maredudd ap Maelgwn, and Hywel ap Cadwallon, not to be confused with the hanged Hywel), petitioned the king to be restored to part of Maelienydd ‚Äì Ceri; despite the advice of the king's advisors, who pointed out Maredudd and Hywel's past support for Gwynedd's rebellion, this seems to have been granted. Nevertheless, a few years later the subsequent Gwyneddian prince, Llywelyn ap Gruffudd (grandson of Llywelyn Fawr), became aggrieved by Henry III's suggestion of adjusting the Treaty of Woodstock to provide for Llywelyn's younger brother, who had now reached adulthood. Llywelyn attacked the Perfeddwlad, which was held by Henry's son, Edward. Henry's problems with his barons (eventually leading to the Second Barons' War) prevented him from fully resisting Llywelyn's campaign, so Llywelyn took advantage by expanding Gwynedd's power even further. In 1262 Maelienydd fell to Llywelyn. In 1275, Llywelyn ap Gruffudd married Eleanor de Montfort, the daughter of Henry's greatest enemy. Aggrieved by this, Edward, the new king, declared Llywelyn a rebel, and in 1277 attacked Gwynedd with an enormous army. Llywelyn was forced to agree, by the Treaty of Aberconwy, to limit his authority to Gwynedd alone. Maelienydd was given to Llywelyn Fawr's other grandson, Roger Mortimer, the son of Ralph; this hence became a Marcher Lordship, outside of either English or Welsh law; Maredudd's son, Madog, however, was confirmed in possession of Ceri, which was detached from Maelienydd as a distinct Marcher Lordship.D. Stephenson: The Lordship of Ceri in the Thirteenth Century, Montgomeryshire Collections 95 (2007), pages 23‚Äì31 Madog's son married Einion o r Porth's granddaughter. In 1282, Llywelyn ap Gruffudd again attacked Edward's lands, and was subsequently killed in Buellt, while attacking the local castle; his headless body was buried in Cwmhir Abbey. As the forces of Ceri had sided with Llywelyn, Ceri was declared forfeit, and handed to Roger. Strictly speaking, however, Ceri was not the last part of Ferlix to be dominated by the family of Elystan Glodrydd. In the 15th century, the descendant and heir of Roger Mortimer, Richard Plantagenet, appointed Ieuan ap Philip as castellan of Cefnllys; Ieuan was a scion of the Cadogan family, and thus a direct male descendant of Elystan Glodrydd, by a cadet branch  Fate  In 1277, Elfael had been acquired by the Tosny family, apart from the area around Radnor, which had been given to Roger Mortimer (in right of his wife, Maud de Braose, heir of Philip de Braose). By the 15th century, the Tosny lordship had been inherited by Margaret Beauchamp of Bletso, whose grandson, Henry, married Richard Plantagenet's granddaughter, and heir, Elizabeth of York. Ferlix was therefore re-united when Maelienydd, Radnor, and the rest of Elfael, was inherited by Henry and Elizabeth's son, King Henry VIII. Following Henry VIII's Laws in Wales Acts, Ferlix became the main part of Radnorshire. The name survives for the general area.

It is one of three \\"wings\\" (overarching units) located in the United Kingdom as components of 3rd Air Force and U.S. Air Forces in Europe (USAFE). History The 501st Combat Support Wing traces its lineage and heritage back to the 501st Bombardment Group, Very Heavy, established on 25 May 1944 and activated on 1 June 1944 at Dalhart Army Airfield, Texas. The unit moved to Harvard Army Air Field, NE, on 22 August and started training with the B-29B, equipped with the APQ-7 Eagle radar for precision high- altitude all-weather bombing. Along with the other three groups of the 315th Bomb Wing, their mission was to finish taking out the Japanese oil refining, distribution and storage network. Deploying in April 1945 to new airfields built on Guam, crews flew 15 combat missions before the war ended, earning a Distinguished Unit Citation for attacks on Japanese oil targets in the closing days of WW II. 501 BG crews then flew numerous missions airdropping food and supplies for Allied prisoners in POW camps across Japan, Korea, Manchuria and China. The 501 BG inactivated on 10 June 1946. 701st Tactical Missile Wing The 701st Tactical Missile Wing was established on 3 August 1956 and activated on 15 September 1956 at Hahn Air Base, Germany; the history and heritage of the 701 TMW and 501 TMW was consolidated in 1982. The first tactical missile wing in the U.S. Air Force when activated, it replaced the 7382d Guided Missile Group (Tactical) and controlled three tactical missile groups, each with TM-61C Matador-equipped missile squadrons. In turn, the wing was inactivated on 18 June 1958 and replaced by the 38th Tactical Missile Wing. 501st Tactical Missile Wing Redesignated as the 501st Tactical Missile Wing on 11 January 1982, it was activated on 1 July 1982, at RAF Greenham Common, England, to operate the Gryphon (BGM-109G) Ground Launched Cruise Missile (GLCM). The 501 TMW was inactivated on 31 May 1991 after ratification of the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty resulted in decommissioning of the BGM-109G. The USAF's first GLCM wing when it stood up, it was the also the last GLCM wing to be inactivated. 501st Combat Support Wing The unit was redesignated the 501st Combat Support Wing on 22 March 2005 and activated on 12 May 2005 at RAF Mildenhall, England, to manage and support geographically separated USAF units, installations and activities in the United Kingdom not directly supporting operations at RAF Mildenhall or RAF Lakenheath. Effective 1 May 2007, it relocated to RAF Alconbury. The 501 CSW currently oversees and supports four Air Base Groups operating a total of eleven installations and operating locations in the U.K. and Norway; the 420th Air Base Group at Royal Air Force (RAF) Fairford and RAF Welford; the 421st Air Base Group at RAF Menwith Hill; the 422d Air Base Group at RAF Croughton; and the 423d Air Base Group at RAF Alconbury, including RAF Molesworth, RAF Upwood and Sola Air Station (what the USAF calls Stavanger Air Base) in Norway. The 501st CSW also serves as the administrative agent for NATO in the U.K. RAF Fairford and RAF Welford house the 420th Air Base Group. Their mission is to receive, bed-down and sustain munitions to enable U.S. and NATO forces to conduct full-spectrum flying operations from USAFE's only bomber- forward operating location. RAF Fairford is a forward operating location for the Boeing B-52, the B-1 and the B-2 bomber aircraft. It also assists in U-2 aircraft deployment, deployed operations training and serves as an alternate landing site for the U.S. Space Shuttle. RAF Fairford annually hosts the world's largest military airshow called the Royal International Air Tattoo (RIAT); typically held in July. RAF Welford comprises 806 acres and is bordered by a 31,680 foot fence-line. They are home to the U.S. Air Forces in Europe's second largest munitions hub. The installation currently maintains 15,000 bombs; over a $160 million stockpile. RAF Menwith Hill houses the 421st Air Base Group. Their mission is to ensure a full range of base support services for an installation populace of 4,500 military, civilians, contractors and their families. The group hosts 10 multi-national, multi- service, multi-agency units performing U.S. and U.K. cryptologic missions and provides base mission support to RAF Menwith Hill. Menwith Hill Station serves as an integral part of the UKUSA intelligence network serving U.K., U.S. and their allied interests. RAF Croughton houses the 422nd Air Base Group whose mission is to provide installation support, services, force protection, and worldwide communications across the entire spectrum of operations. The group is the premier global communication provider in the U.K. and supports NATO, U.S. European Command, U.S. Central Command, Air Force Special Operations Command, U.S. Department of State operations and Ministry of Defense operations. The group sustains more than 450 C2 circuits; and supports 25 percent of all European Theater to continental United States (CONUS) communications. RAF Alconbury houses the 423rd Air Base Group whose mission is to provide mission support services to the Joint Intelligent Operations Center Europe (JIOCEUR) Analytic Center (commonly known as the Joint Analysis Center), NATO's Intelligence Fusion Center, and the RAF Alconbury, RAF Molesworth and RAF Upwood and Stavanger Air Base (Norway) communities. RAF Alconbury is also home to the 501st CSW headquarters staff and hosts a community of 6,000 individuals associated with more than 15 multi-service and multi-national units. RAF Upwood houses the medical and dental facilities for the RAF Alconbury, RAF Molesworth, and RAF Upwood communities. Sola Air Station (\\"Stavanger Air Base\\" to the USAF) in southern Norway is also under the 501st CSW and houses the 426th Air Base Squadron. The squadron mission is to provide base-level support to 220 U.S. service members and their families at NATO's Joint Warfare Center. The squadron also supports \\"Operating Location-A\\" in Oslo, Norway, shipping for $50 million war readiness material and $900 million U.S. Marine Corps and U.S. Navy equipment. In total, the 501st CSW has almost 2,600 U.S. military and civilian employees directly assigned, including non-appropriated fund employees. There are also 117 U.K. personnel who work directly for the wing in appropriated and non-appropriated positions and more than 180 U.K. Ministry of Defence Police, Defense Schools and our many tenant units along with family members and retirees who reside in the United Kingdom.  2007-08 leadership issues  The 423d Air Base Group commander, Col. Robert G. Steele, was dismissed from his position on 18 January 2008 by the 501 CSW commander after only 6 months in command. The reason Col. Kimberly Toney gave was \\"I lost confidence in Col. Steele's ability to lead the group.\\" No criminal charges were filed against Col. Steele. The group commander of RAF Croughton, Col. John Jordan, was brought in to dually command the group at RAF Alconbury. The 501 CSW commander acknowledged the period was a \\"Painful challenge\\" and the 501 CSW commander (Col. Kimberly Toney) made a statement in an interview to the Stars and Stripes newspaper that indicated the members of the 423rd ABG \\"blame themselves\\" for the sacking of Steele.

Old St Paul's is an historic site, a city landmark and a popular wedding and event venue in the heart of Wellington, the capital city of New Zealand. The building served as the pro-cathedral (provisional cathedral) of the Diocese of Wellington of the Anglican Church between 1866 and 1964. It exemplifies 19th-century Gothic Revival architecture adapted to colonial conditions and materials, and stands at 34 Mulgrave Street, Thorndon, close to the parliament precinct.

Wellington‚Äôs Old Buildings. Wellington: Victoria University Press, 1994, p. 52. Architecture Old St Paul's is built in a Gothic style, albeit with a subdued effect due to the limited resources available. It is constructed from New Zealand native timbers, with stunning stained-glass windows. The interior has been likened to the upturned hull of an Elizabethan galleon, with exposed curving rimu trusses and kauri roof sarking.  Current situation  Old St Paul's is now managed by Heritage New Zealand Pouhere Taonga. While no longer used as a parish church, it remains consecrated, and is a popular venue for weddings, funerals and other services. The flags displayed in the nave include the ensigns of the Royal Navy, the New Zealand Merchant Navy and the United States Marine Corps (second division), which was stationed in Wellington during World War II. The church retains close links with the New Zealand Defence Force. Some of the walls and columns of Old St Paul's are decorated with memorial plaques, including many dedicated to those who fought and died in World War I. There is a plaque in memory of Wellington historian John Beaglehole, most famous for his biography of explorer James Cook, but who also played a significant role in the fight to save Old St Paul's from demolition. Old St Paul's is closed from May 2019 until July 2020 for seismic strengthening work.

Individually, Pevear has also translated into English works from French, Italian, and Greek. The couple's collaborative translations have been nominated three times and twice won the PEN/Book-of-the-Month Club Translation Prize (for Tolstoy's Anna Karenina and Dostoevsky's The Brothers Karamazov). Their translation of Dostoevsky's The Idiot also won the first Efim Etkind Translation Prize. Richard Pevear Richard Pevear was born in Waltham, Massachusetts, on 21 April 1943. Pevear earned a B.A. degree from Allegheny College in 1964, and a M.A. degree from the University of Virginia in 1965. He has taught at the University of New Hampshire, The Cooper Union, Mount Holyoke College, Columbia University, and the University of Iowa. In 1998, he joined the faculty of the American University of Paris (AUP), where he taught courses in Russian literature and translation. In 2007, he was named Distinguished Professor of Comparative Literature at AUP, and in 2009 he became Distinguished Professor Emeritus. Besides translating Russian classics, Pevear also translated from the French (Alexandre Dumas, Yves Bonnefoy, Jean Starobinsky), Italian (Alberto Savinio), Spanish, and Greek (Aias, by Sophokles, in collaboration with Herb Golder). He is also the author of two books of poems (The Night Talk, and Exchanges). Pevear is mostly known for his work in collaboration with Larissa Volokhonsky on translation of Russian classics. Larissa Volokhonsky Larissa Volokhonsky () was born into a Jewish family in Leningrad, now St. Petersburg, on 1 October 1945. After graduating from Leningrad State University with a degree in mathematical linguistics, she worked in the Institute of Marine Biology (Vladivostok) and travelled extensively in Sakhalin Island and Kamchatka (1968-1973). Volokhonsky emigrated to Israel in 1973, where she lived for two years. Having moved to the United States in 1975, she studied at Yale Divinity School (1977-1979) and at St Vladimir's Orthodox Theological Seminary (1979-1981), where her professors were the Orthodox theologians Alexander Schmemann and John Meyendorff. She completed her studies of theology with the diploma of Master of Divinity from Yale University. She began collaboration with her husband Richard Pevear in 1985. Larissa Volokhonsky translated from English into Russian \\"For the Life of the World\\" by Alexander Schmemann (RBR,Inc, 1982) and \\"Introduction to Patristic Theology\\" by John Meyendorff (RBR,Inc, 1981) Both translations are still in print in Russia. Together with Richard Pevear she translated into English some poetry and prose by her brother, Anri Volokhonsky (published in: Modern Poetry in Translation, New series. Ed. Daniel Weissbort. Vol 10, Winter 196, Grand Street,Spring 1989, ed. Ben Sonnenberg). Together with Emily Grossholz, she translated several poems by Olga Sedakova (Hudson Review, Vol. 61, Issue 4, Winter 2009). Volokhonsky is mostly known for her work in collaboration with Richard Pevear on translation of Russian classics. Collaboration Volokhonsky met Pevear in the United States in 1976 and they married six years later.Trachtenberg, Jeffrey A. \\"Translating Tolstoy\\", Wall Street Journal, November 17, 2009. Retrieved 2011-02-28.

Retrieved 2011-02-27. Pevear and Volokhonsky began working together when Pevear was reading Dostoevsky's The Brothers Karamazov and Volokhonsky noticed what she regarded to be the inadequacy of the translation by David Magarshack. As a result, the couple collaborated on their own version, producing three sample chapters which they sent to publishers. They were turned down by Random House and Oxford University Press but received encouragement from a number of Slavic scholars and were in the end accepted by North Point Press, a small publishing house in San Francisco who paid them a $1,000 advance. It went on to win a PEN/Book-of-the-Month Club Translation Prize. Their translation of Anna Karenina won another PEN/BOMC Translation Prize. Oprah Winfrey chose this translation of Anna Karenina as a selection for her \\"Oprah's Book Club\\" on her television program, which led to a major increase in sales of this translation and greatly increased recognition for Pevear and Volokhonsky. Their translation of Dostoevsky's The Idiot won the first Efim Etkind Translation Prize awarded by the European University of St. Petersburg. The husband-and- wife team works in a two-step process: Volokhonsky prepares her English version of the original text, trying to follow Russian syntax and stylistic peculiarities as closely as possible, and Pevear turns this version into polished and stylistically appropriate English. Pevear has variously described their working process as follows: > \\"Larissa goes over it, raising questions. And then we go over it again. I > produce another version, which she reads against the original. We go over it > one more time, and then we read it twice more in proof.\\" > \\"We work separately at first. Larissa produces a complete draft, following > the original as closely as possible, with many marginal comments and > observations. From that, plus the original Russian, I make my own complete > draft. Then we work closely together to arrive at a third draft, on which we > make our 'final' revisions.\\" Volokhonsky and Pevear were interviewed about the art of translation for Ideas, the long running Canadian Broadcasting Company (CBC) radio documentary. It was a 3-part program called \\"In Other Words\\" and involved discussions with many leading translators. The program was podcast in April 2007. Their translation of Leo Tolstoy's War and Peace was published on 16 October 2007 by Alfred A. Knopf. It was the subject of a month-long discussion in the \\"Reading Room\\" site of The New York Times Book Review. On October 18, 2007, they appeared at the New York Public Library in conversation with Keith Gessen to celebrate the publication. Their 2010 translation of Boris Pasternak's Doctor Zhivago met with adverse criticism from Pasternak's niece, Ann Pasternak Slater, in a book review for The Guardian, but earned praise for \\"powerful fidelity\\" from Angela Livingstone in The Times Literary Supplement.Livingstone, Angela, (24/06/2011) Meaning Every Word of It. TLS. Their translation of Svetlana Alexievich's book The Unwomanly Face of War: An Oral History of Women in World War II was published in 2017. Reception While Pevear and Volokhonsky have won awards for their translations and enjoyed success within the publishing industry, their work has not been without criticism. Writing in The New York Review of Books in 2016, the critic Janet Malcolm argued that Pevear and Volokhonsky \\"have established an industry of taking everything they can get their hands on written in Russian and putting it into flat, awkward English\\". Other translators have voiced similar criticism, both in Russiahttp://www.thinkaloud.ru/feature/berdy-lan- PandV-e.html The Sweet Smell of Success? Russian Classics in the Translation of R. Pevear and L. Volokhonsky M.Berdy, V.Lanchikov and in the English- speaking world.

Commentary. July 1, 2010. Retrieved on July 19, 2015. Criticism has been focused on the excessive literalness of the couple's translations and the perception that they miss the original tone of the authors.

In epistemology, the M√ºnchhausen trilemma is a thought experiment used to demonstrate the impossibility of proving any truth, even in the fields of logic and mathematics. If it is asked how any given proposition is known to be true, proof may be provided. Yet that same question can be asked of the proof, and any subsequent proof. The M√ºnchhausen trilemma is that there are only three options when providing further proof in response to further questioning: * The circular argument, in which the proof of some proposition is supported only by that proposition * The regressive argument, in which each proof requires a further proof, ad infinitum * The dogmatic argument, which rests on accepted precepts which are merely asserted rather than defended The trilemma, then, is the decision among the three equally unsatisfying options. The name M√ºnchhausen-Trilemma was coined by the German philosopher Hans Albert in 1968 in reference to a trilemma of \\"dogmatism versus infinite regress versus psychologism\\" used by Karl Popper.Dogmatismus ‚Äì unendlicher Regre√ü ‚Äì Psychologismus Albert, Traktat √ºber kritische Vernunft, 1968, p. 11, cited after Westermann, Argumentationen und Begr√ºndungen in der Ethik und Rechtslehre, 1977, p. 15. It is a reference to the problem of \\"bootstrapping\\", based on the story of Baron Munchausen (in German, \\"M√ºnchhausen\\") pulling himself and the horse on which he was sitting out of a mire by his own hair. It is also known as Agrippa's trilemma or the Agrippan trilemma after a similar argument reported by Sextus Empiricus, which was attributed to Agrippa the Skeptic by Diogenes La√´rtius. Sextus' argument, however, consists of five (not three) \\"modes\\". Popper in his original 1935 publication mentions neither Sextus nor Agrippa, but instead attributes his trilemma to German philosopher Jakob Friedrich Fries, leading some to call it Fries's trilemma as a result.Robert Nola, \\"Conceptual and Non-Conceptual Content\\", in : Karl Popper: A Centenary Assessment vol 2, 2006, p. 15 In contemporary epistemology, advocates of coherentism are supposed to accept the \\"circular\\" horn of the trilemma; foundationalists rely on the axiomatic argument. The view that accepts infinite regress is called infinitism.  Agrippa and the Pyrrhonists  The following tropes or \\"modes\\" for Pyrrhonism are given by Sextus Empiricus, in his Outlines of Pyrrhonism. According to Sextus, they are attributed \\"to the more recent Pyrrhonists\\" and by Diogenes La√´rtius attributed to Agrippa the Skeptic.Diogenes La√´rtius, ix. The tropes are: * Dissent ‚Äì The uncertainty demonstrated by the differences of opinions among philosophers and people in general. * Progress ad infinitum ‚Äì All proof rests on matters themselves in need of proof, and so on to infinity. See regress argument. * Relation ‚Äì All things are changed as their relations become changed, or, as they are looked upon from different points of view. * Assumption ‚Äì The truth asserted is based on an unsupported assumption. * Circularity ‚Äì the truth asserted involves a circularity of proofs (known in scholasticism as \\"diallelus\\"). > According to the mode deriving from dispute, we find that undecidable > dissension about the matter proposed has come about both in ordinary life > and among philosophers. Because of this we are not able to choose or to rule > out anything, and we end up with suspension of judgement. In the mode > deriving from infinite regress, we say that what is brought forward as a > source of conviction for the matter proposed itself needs another such > source, which itself needs another, and so ad infinitum, so that we have no > point from which to begin to establish anything, and suspension of judgement > follows. In the mode deriving from relativity, as we said above, the > existing object appears to be such-and-such relative to the subject judging > and to the things observed together with it, but we suspend judgement on > what it is like in its nature. We have the mode from hypothesis when the > Dogmatists, being thrown back ad infinitum, begin from something which they > do not establish but claim to assume simply and without proof in virtue of a > concession. The reciprocal mode occurs when what ought to be confirmatory of > the object under investigation needs to be made convincing by the object > under investigation; then, being unable to take either in order to establish > the other, we suspend judgement about both.Sextus Empiricus, Pyrrh≈çneioi > hypotyp≈çseis i., from Annas, J., Outlines of Scepticism Cambridge University > Press. (2000). With reference to these five tropes, the first and third are a short summary of the ten modes of Aenesidemus which were the basis of earlier Pyrrhonism. The three additional ones show a progress in the Pyrrhonist system, and a transition from the common objections derived from the fallibility of sense and opinion, to more abstract and metaphysical grounds of skepticism. According to Victor Brochard, \\"the five tropes can be regarded as the most radical and most precise formulation of skepticism that has ever been given. In a sense, they are still irresistible today.\\"Brochard, V., The Greek Skeptics.  Fries's trilemma  Jakob Friedrich Fries formulated a similar trilemma in which statements can be accepted either:J. F. Fries, Neue oder anthropologische Kritik der Vernunft (1828 to 1831). * dogmatically * supported by infinite regress * based on perceptual experience (psychologism) The first two possibilities are rejected by Fries as unsatisfactory, requiring his adopting the third option. Karl Popper argued that a way to avoid the trilemma was to use an intermediate approach incorporating some dogmatism, some infinite regress, and some perceptual experience.Karl Popper, \\"The Logic of Scientific Discovery\\", p. 87  Albert's formulation  The argument proposed by Hans Albert runs as follows: All of the only three possible attempts to get a certain justification must fail: * All justifications in pursuit of \\"certain\\" knowledge have also to justify the means of their justification and doing so they have to justify anew the means of their justification. Therefore, there can be no end, only the hopeless situation of infinite regression * A circular argument can be used to justify by its mock impression of validity and soundness, but this sacrifices its usefulness (as the conclusion and premise are one and the same, no advancement in knowledge has taken place). * One can stop at self-evidence or common sense or fundamental principles or speaking ex cathedra or at any other evidence, but in doing so, the intention to install 'certain' justification is abandoned. An English translation of a quote from the original German text by Albert is as follows:Albert, H., Traktat √ºber kritische Vernunft, p. 15 (T√ºbingen: J.C.B. Mohr, 1991). > Here, one has a mere choice between: # An infinite regression, which appears > because of the necessity to go ever further back, but is not practically > feasible and does not, therefore, provide a certain foundation. # A logical > circle in the deduction, which is caused by the fact that one, in the need > to found, falls back on statements which had already appeared before as > requiring a foundation, and which circle does not lead to any certain > foundation either. # A break of searching at a certain point, which indeed > appears principally feasible, but would mean a random suspension of the > principle of sufficient reason. Albert stressed repeatedly that there is no limitation of the M√ºnchhausen trilemma to deductive conclusions. The verdict concerns also inductive, causal, transcendental, and all otherwise structured justifications. They all will be in vain. Therefore, certain justification is impossible to attain. Once having given up the classical idea of certain knowledge, one can stop the process of justification where one wants to stop, presupposed one is ready to start critical thinking at this point always anew if necessary. This trilemma rounds off the classical problem of justification in the theory of knowledge. The failure of proving exactly any truth as expressed by the M√ºnchhausen trilemma does not have to lead to dismissal of objectivity, as with relativism. One example of an alternative is the fallibilism of Karl Popper and Hans Albert, accepting that certainty is impossible, but that it is best to get as close as possible to truth, while remembering our uncertainty. In Albert's view, the impossibility to prove any certain truth is not in itself a certain truth. After all, one needs to assume some basic rules of logical inference to derive his result, and in doing so must either abandon the pursuit of \\"certain\\" justification, as above, or attempt to justify these rules, etc. He suggests that it has to be taken as true as long as nobody has come forward with a truth which is scrupulously justified as a certain truth. Several philosophers defied Albert's challenge; his responses to such criticisms can be found in his long addendum to his Treatise on Critical Reason and later articles.

Andreas Wieland, Carl Marcus Wallenburg (2011): Supply- Chain-Management in st√ºrmischen Zeiten. Berlin. (cf. Wieland/Wallenburg, 2011) Demand-chain management (DCM) is the management of relationships between suppliers and customers to deliver the best value to the customer at the least cost to the demand chain as a whole. Demand-chain management is similar to supply-chain management but with special regard to the customers. Demand- chain-management software tools bridge the gap between the customer- relationship management and the supply-chain management. The organization's supply chain processes are managed to deliver best value according to the demand of the customers. DCM creates strategic assets for the firm in terms of the overall value creation as it enables the firm to implement and integrate marketing and supply chain management (SCM) strategies that improve its overall performance.Madhani, P. M. (2013). Demand Chain Management: Enhancing Customer Value Proposition. The European Business Review, March - April, pp. 50-54. A study of the university in Wageningen (the Netherlands) sees DCM as an extension of supply chain management, due to its incorporation of the market-orientation perspective on its concept.Abstract WU dissertation no. 4036 Demand-driven supply network A Demand-driven supply network (DDSN) is one method of supply-chain management which involves building supply chains in response to demand signals. The main force of DDSN is that it is driven by customers demand. In comparison with the traditional supply chain, DDSN uses the pull technique. It gives DDSN market opportunities to share more information and to collaborate with others in the supply chain. DDSN uses a capability model that consist of four levels. The first level is Reacting, the second level is Anticipating, the third level is Collaborating and the last level is Orchestrating. The first two levels focus on the internal supply chain while the last two levels concentrate on external relations throughout the Extended Enterprise.Martin R, 2006, GMA and AMR Research, The Demand Driven Supply Network DDSN, Your Business Operating Strategy; 15 In a demand- driven chain, a customer activates the flow by ordering from the retailer, who reorders from the wholesaler, who reorders from the manufacturer, who reorders raw materials from suppliers. Orders flow backward, up the chain, in this structure. Many companies are trying to shift from a build-to-forecast to a build-to-order discipline. The property of being demand-driven is one of degree: Being \\"0 percent\\" demand-driven means all production/inventory decisions are based on forecasts, and so, all products available for sale to the end user is there by virtue of a forecast. This could be the case of fashion goods, where the designer may not know how buyers will react to a new design, or the beverage industry, where products are produced based on a given forecast. A \\"100 percent\\" demand-driven is one in which the order is received before production begins. The commercial aircraft industry match to this description. In most cases, no production occurs until the order is received. Competitive advantages To create sustainable competitive advantages with DDSN, companies have to do deal with three conditions: Alignment (create shared incentives), Agility (respond quickly to short-term change) and Adaptability (adjust design of the supply chain).Lee, H, 2004. The Triple ‚ÄìA Supply Chain. Harvard Business Review 82; 10 102-112 Misconceptions There are five commonly-made misconceptions of demand driven (DDSN):Cecere, L., Hofman, D., Martin, R., Preslan L., The Handbook for Becoming Demand Driven, AMR Research, Juli 2005; 4 #Companies might think they are demand driven because they have a good forecast of their company. #They have implemented lean manufacturing. #They have great data on all their customers. #They think it is a technology project and the corporate forecast is a demand visibility signal. #They have a better view of customers demand. An important component of DDSN is DDM (\\"real-time\\" demand driven manufacturing). DDM gives customers the opportunity to say what they want, where and when. Demand- driven execution Demand-chain management is the same as supply chain management, but with emphasis on consumer pull vs. supplier push. The demand chain begins with customers, then funnels through any resellers, distributors, and other business partners who help sell the company's products and services. The demand chain includes both direct and indirect sales forces.Beyond CRM: The Critical Path to Successful Demand Chain Management www.crmadvocate.com/required/scribe1.pdf Customers demand is hard to detect because out of stock situations (OOS) falsify data collected from POS- Terminals. According to studies of Corsten/Gruen (2002, 2008) the OOS-rate is about 8%. For products under sales promotion OOS rates up to 30% exist. Reliable information about demand is necessary for DCM therefore lowering OOS is a main factor for successful DCM. Corsten and Gruen describe key factors for lowering OOS-rates: * Data accuracy * Forecast and order accuracy * Order quantity * Replenishment * Capacity (time supply) * Capacity (Packout) and Planogram Compliance * Shelf Replenishment Implementation of system supported processes leads to the new technology Extreme Transaction Processing described by Gartner Research. This technology allows to process the huge amount of data (POS, RFID) in real time providing information for store managers, shelve managers and the supply chain. According to studies of Ayers, in order to find appropriate methods which fitting different kinds of companies, the first thing companies should do is to assess their progress toward achieving world- class levels of supply chain management. In order to raise demand-driven levels, companies need to undertake a systematic effort that has three elements: # Shortening process lead-time: Overall lead-time is composed of individual cycle-times for multiple processes. This step involves shortening the cycle-time at each step in the critical path processes from the point of purchase to the start of production for the entire supply chain. # Adopting flow model economics: Flow model economics encompass low-cost ways to vary mix and volume. Lean manufacturing is a discipline that has the same goals as flow economics. # Replacing forecasts with demand: This step requires efficient sharing of information up and down the chain. An ideal is for all partners to have access to the level of real-time sales as well as the business rules to react.  Demand-driven supply-chain assessment  Companies must have an appropriate performance-measurement system to be applied on a regular basis to identify areas to be improved in order to establish a sustainable continuous improvement process. According to Dale and Ritchie, to use self-assessment process is very important. The self-assessment will allow organizations to discern its strengths and gaps, and define improvement actions linked to the business planning process. There are some necessary criteria for a successful self-assessment process: * Gaining commitment and support from all levels of staff * Action being taken from the previous self-assessment * Incorporation of self-assessment into the business planning process * Not allowing the process to be \\"added on\\" to employees existing workload * Developing a framework for performance monitoring The importance of supply chain and operations audit process which represents a fundamental step to support improvement projects. According to study of Salama, the core element of audits is the diagnostic stage and that no audit can be considered successful unless it really provides a thorough understanding of how the constituent elements of an organization interact with one another (e.g., people, processes and technologies), that is the interactions which constrain the system, and how these interactions are reflected on the market-driven performance. The provided a set of features and requirements for an audit methodology that can be considered when developing a DDSC assessment: * Quick/Accurate ‚Äì The methodology should be based on tools, steps and an\\"engine\\" which were designed to deliver a result as accurate as possible in the shortest time possible. * Not invasive ‚Äì The methodology should be built in order to require the least possible effort from organization's resource. * Scalable ‚Äì The methodology should be scalable. * Avoid bias/theoretically grounded ‚Äì The methodology should be built in a way to reduce possible bias in the diagnostic stage, while exploiting the knowledge that people who daily work in an organization have on their processes. * Stimulate consensus building ‚Äì The stimulation of consensus building can be achieved in different ways. * Transparent ‚Äì All tools and steps used in the methodology should be clearlyd escribed in all parts.

It is published three times each year, and content is published on its website several times each week. Each print issue averages around 200 pages in length. Overview n+1 began in late 2004, the project of Keith Gessen, Benjamin Kunkel, Mark Greif, Chad Harbach, Allison Lorentzen and Marco Roth. The magazine is described by Gessen as \\"like Partisan Review, except not dead.\\" It was launched out of a feeling of dissatisfaction with the current intellectual scene in the United States, with the editors citing The Baffler, Hermenaut, and the early years of Partisan Review as inspiration for their magazine. Each of those magazines embodied the age where the \\"little magazine\\" was a veritable institution and a major center of innovation in arts and politics. Their outlook is most frequently summed up by the last lines of their first issue where the editors proclaimed, \\"it is time to say what you mean.\\"They argue that their mission is to create a sense of intellectual cohesion. Kunkel said, \\"There's a tendency to ghettoize things that are important to us ‚Äî there's fiction, there's essays and criticism, there's politics ‚Äî and you can go and find journals about each of these things, but you can't go and find journals about all of those things.\\" Yet in the third issue, critic James Wood responded to criticism of his negative criticism and, singling out this quote from issue 1, stated, \\"The Editors had unwittingly proved the gravamen of their own critique: that it is easier to criticize than to propose.\\" The name n+1, conceived in a moment of frustration, comes from an algebraic expression. \\"Keith and I were talking\\", Harbach recalls, \\"and he kept saying, 'Why would we start a magazine when there are already so many out there?' And I said, jokingly, 'N+1'‚Äîwhatever exists, there is always something vital that has to be added or we wouldn't feel anything lacking in this world.\\" Position Their mission is somewhat informed by critical theory, to which they readily admit the attraction and limitations. In an article on theory, the editors said, \\"The big mistake right now would be to fail to keep faith with what theory once meant to us.\\" Their stance embraces theory but keeps a careful distance from the academicization of theory: \\"Theory is dead, and long live theory. The designated mourners have tenure, anyway, so they‚Äôll be around a bit. As for the rest of us, an opening has emerged, in the novel and in intellect. What to do with it?\\" In this vein, they make frequent references to the Frankfurt School, often criticize the commodification of culture, and speak positively of writers such as Don DeLillo. Content Each issue of n+1 opens with a section called The Intellectual Situation,The Intellectual Situation which criticizes aspects of the current intellectual scene. For example, in the first issue, they called McSweeney's a \\"regressive avant-garde\\"; in Issue 18, the editors criticize \\"the Rage Machine\\" in which \\"tech corporations beg you to say your piece for the sake of content- generation, free publicity, hype, and ad sales.\\" They have also criticized The New Republic, The Weekly Standard, and literary figures such as Dale Peck. This is followed by a short Politics section. Most of each issue consists of fiction and essays. Issues then close with a review section, which consists of reviews of books, intellectual figures, and pop phenomena. Critical response The magazine has received mixed criticism to date. Generally, n+1's detractors decry the editors' youth and perceived elitism. As the magazine is purportedly an effort to engage a generation in a struggle against the current literary landscape, such elitism seems counterintuitive to the ideals upon which the magazine was founded. The New Criterion critically asked, \\"is your journal really necessary?\\" and accused them of exaggerating their own importance. The Times Literary Supplement wryly satirized Kunkel's quote, \\"We're angrier than Dave Eggers and his crowd\\", and compared that quote against their third issue's unsigned article about and titled \\"Dating\\". Literary editor Gordon Lish has called the magazine a \\"crock of shit.\\" Others have appreciated these very qualities, writing favorably of the boldness of the project itself and the sincerity and enthusiasm of its contributors. Critic A. O. Scott of The New York Times commented on this in a feature article on the new wave of young, intellectual publications in a September 2005 issue of The New York Times Magazine, saying that n+1 was trying to \\"organize a generational struggle against laziness and cynicism, to raise once again the banners of creative enthusiasm and intellectual engagement\\" and that it had a feel that was \\"decidedly youthful, not only in [its] characteristic generational concerns ‚Äî the habit of nonchalantly blending pop culture, literary esoterica and academic theory, for instance, or the unnerving ability to appear at once mocking and sincere ‚Äî but also in the sense of bravado and grievance that ripples through their pages.\\" In a review of Gessen's novel, All the Sad Young Literary Men, Joyce Carol Oates referenced the author's founding of \\"the spirited intellectual literary journal n+1\\". Books=n+1 Research Branch Small Books Series Beginning in 2006, with the publication of PS 1 Symposium: A Practical Avant-Garde, n+1 introduced the n+1 Research Branch Pamphlet Series, later known as the n+1 Research Branch Small Books Series. This self-published series expands on the concerns of the magazine, and focuses on topics as disparate as ‚Äúlife and reading‚Äù in early adulthood, feminism, hipster culture, and the collapse of America‚Äôs financial system. There are six titles in the series in addition to A Practical Avant-Garde: What We Should Have Known: Two Discussions, What Was the Hipster: A Sociological Investigation, The Trouble is the Banks: Letters to Wall Street, No Regrets: Three Discussions, and \\"Buzz,\\" a play by Benjamin Kunkel. No Regrets, comprising conversations among women writers about their reading, was praised by NPR as \\"intimate and erudite\\", but The New Republic, gathering its own panel of women staff writers, criticized the book's discussion of a so- called \\"secret canon\\" as being insular. The Financial Crisis and Occupy Diary of a Very Bad Year In addition to the Research Branch‚Äôs The Trouble is the Banks, the n+1 has published several works concerning the financial crisis and the Occupy movement. In 2010, n+1 collaborated with Harper Perennial to publish Diary of a Very Bad Year: Confessions of an Anonymous Hedge Fund Manager, a series of one-on-one interviews between Gessen and ‚Äúa very charming, very intelligent‚Äù member of the finance industry that explore the origins and effects of the financialization of the economy. Some sections of the book had been published online and in the magazine from 2007‚Äì2010. New York Times book reviewer Dwight Garner called the book \\"thoughtful, funny and unpretentious\\"‚Äî\\"an urbane if frazzled chronicle of shock and despair\\". With direction from Astra Taylor and Sarah Leonard, n+1 built on this discussion of the financial crisis and its fallout with the publication of the Occupy! Gazette, ‚Äúa semi-regular, forty-page tabloid newspaper inspired by the Occupy movement‚Äù. The Gazette featured interviews and panels, as well as firsthand reporting from Occupy demonstrations around the United States. n+1 ultimately published four issues of the Occupy! Gazette, in addition to one special issue published in May 2014, ‚ÄúFree Cecily!‚Äù, which covered the arrest and trial of Occupy organizer and protester Cecily McMillan. In 2011, in collaboration with Verso, n+1 published Occupy! Scenes from an Occupied America, edited by Astra Taylor and Keith Gessen, along with ‚Äúeditors from n+1, Dissent, Triple Canopy and The New Inquiry‚Äù. The book featured commentary from Taylor, Mark Greif, Nikil Saval, and Rebecca Solnit, alongside reprinted remarks made at Zucotti Park by Judith Butler and Slavoj ≈Ωi≈æek. Taylor, Greif, Gessen, and others contributed segments entitled ‚ÄúScenes from an Occupation,‚Äù which reported the day-to-day conditions at Occupy Wall Street; ‚ÄúScenes from Occupied Atlanta‚Äù and ‚ÄúScenes from Occupied Boston‚Äù, among others, reported from their respective locations around the country. London School of Economics professor Jason Hickel praised the book for its timeliness and \\"moments of excellent insight\\", but noted that the speed with which \\"Occupy!\\" was published limited the depth of its analysis. Co-publishing Faber and Faber n+1, in 2014, initiated a publishing partnership with Farrar, Straus and Giroux subsidiary Faber and Faber. The first publication, MFA vs NYC:Two Cultures of American Fiction, explores fiction‚Äôs gravitation toward the academy in over a dozen essays from writers including David Foster Wallace, George Saunders, Elif Batuman, and Fredric Jameson. The editor of MFA vs NYC, Chad Harbach, introduces the book with his essay of the same title from Issue 10 of the magazine. The New York Times praised it as a ‚Äúserious, helpful and wily book,‚Äù citing the various and intimate insights into the writing world that the book provides, from its ‚Äúexcellent miniature portraits of Frank Conroy and Gordon Lish‚Äù to ‚Äúits gossip and confessional essays‚Äù. MFA vs NYC has inspired various responses throughout the literary world, notably Junot Diaz‚Äôs essay in The New Yorker, ‚ÄúMFA vs POC‚Äù. There are two additional books in the Faber and Faber series: Happiness, an anthology of selected works from the first ten years of n+1, published in September 2014; and City by City, a collection of some previously published pieces from n+1‚Äôs online series of the same name (2015).

It is named after the Chevrolet Corvette, the American sports car for which it was originally developed and first utilized. A notable characteristic of this suspension configuration is the mounting of the mono-leaf spring such that it can serve as both ride spring and anti-roll spring. In contrast to many applications of leaf springs in automotive suspension designs, this type does not use the spring as a locating link. While this suspension type is most notably associated with several generations of the Chevrolet Corvette the design has been used in other production General Motors cars, as well as vehicles from Volvo Cars and Mercedes-Benz. Fiat produced cars with a similar configuration, using a multi-leaf steel spring in place of the FRP mono-leaf spring.  Design  The C5 Corvette's rear suspension The leaf-spring suspension configuration is independent, because the movement of one wheel is not determined by the position of the other. Control arms are utilized to define the motion of the wheel as the suspension is compressed. The usual coil springs are replaced with a single FRP spring, which spans the width of the car. As in independent suspension systems using coil springs, and unlike the common leaf-spring supported Hotchkiss rear axle, the suspension kinematics are defined only by the control arms. As in a coil- spring suspension design, the FRP mono-leaf spring supports the weight of the vehicle. However, the FRP leaf springs differ from steel coils and traditional steel multi-leaf springs in a number of significant ways. The FRP plastic springs have 4.3‚Äì5.5 times the strain energy storage per weight, compared to steel. This results in a lighter spring for a given application. The single FRP mono-leaf front spring used on the fourth-generation Corvette is 33 percent of the weight of an equivalent set of coil springs. Comparing FRP to conventional steel leaf springs in similar applications, the weight saved is even greater. The third-generation Corvette offered an optional FRP mono-leaf spring as an alternative to the standard multi-leaf steel spring, the steel spring being replaced by a FRP spring. Volvo claims a weight savings of by using a FRP spring in the rear suspension of its second-generation XC90, compared to designs using coil springs. In addition to the reduction in vehicle weight, the weight of the spring is partly unsprung mass. The relative sliding movement of the leaves of a multi-leaf steel spring results in stiction-based hysteresis with respect to spring compression. This stiction reduces suspension compliance and can compromise both ride quality and handling. Lacking individual leaves, the mono-leaf spring avoids stiction. FRP springs are advertised as having exceptional cycle life and corrosion resistance. A GM test comparing the third-generation Corvette springs found that failure of the multi-leaf steel springs was likely after 200,000 full- travel cycles. The replacement FRP leaf spring showed no loss of performance after two million full cycles. Packaging is cited as both an advantage and disadvantage of the transverse FRP leaf spring, as compared to coil springs, depending on the application. The FRP spring is typically set low in the suspension, resulting in a low center of gravity. It also allows manufacturers to avoid tall spring mounts, thus resulting in a flatter load floor about the suspension. James Schefter reports that, as used on the C5 and later Corvettes, the use of OEM coilover damper springs would have forced the chassis engineers to either vertically raise the shock towers or move them inward. In the rear this would have reduced trunk space. In the front this would have interfered with engine packaging. The use of the leaf spring allowed the spring to be placed under the chassis, out of the way, while keeping the diameter of the shock-absorber assembly to that of just the damper, rather than damper and spring. However, in other applications, such as race car designs, the need to span the width of the vehicle resulted in significant design limitations. Coil and torsion springs present better packaging options for racing applications. FRP springs also have limited availability and selection as compared to coil springs. Higher cost has also been cited as a disadvantage, when comparing FRP springs to coil springs on production road cars.  Properties  FEA model of a leaf spring under load. The initial, unbent shape of the spring is shown as a silhouette box. An upward deflection on the right side of the spring results in a smaller upward movement on the left side. A notable advantage of the FRP transverse leaf springs‚Äîwhen supported with widely spaced, pivotable mounts‚Äîis the ability to supplement or replace the anti-roll bar. Typically springs that provide a sufficient ride rate need a supplemental spring (the anti-roll bar) to increase the suspension roll rate. The coupling of the two sides of the transverse leaf spring across the vehicle results in an anti-roll bar like behavior. Corvette engineers have cited this property as enabling the use of a lighter anti-roll bar, and even eliminating the rear anti-roll bar on some versions of the seventh generation Corvette. When either wheel is deflected upward, the center span of the spring (the portion between the pivotable mounts) deflects downward. If both wheels deflect upward at the same time (for example, when hitting a bump in the road) the center section bends uniformly between the pivot mounts. In a roll, only one wheel is deflected upwards, which tends to form the center of the spring into an S-shaped curve. The result is that the wheel rate of one side of the suspension depends on the displacement of the other side. The extent to which the spring acts as an anti-roll bar depends on the distance between the pivot mounts and their rigidity. A transverse leaf spring with a central rigid mount. The two spring halves are effectively isolated. Movements of one half of the spring do not affect the other half. A simplified flat, rectangular spring illustrates this principle. Deflecting the right side of the spring results in the left side rising. By comparison, a rigid central mount (2nd and 3rd generation Corvettes and other cars) shows no movement on one side when the other is deflected.  Applications  A number of manufacturers have produced vehicles or concepts utilizing independent front or rear suspensions supported by transverse leaf springs that have an anti-roll effect. * Chevrolet Corvette: C4 1984‚Äì1996 (front only, centrally mounted rear spring did not have the anti-roll effect), C5‚ÄìC7, 1997‚Äì2019 (front and rear). * GM W platform cars: first generation (Lumina, Grand Prix, Regal, Cutlass Supreme). * GM E platform cars: (Eldorado, Toronado, Riviera, Reatta, Allante). * Volvo 960 (from model year 1995) renamed to S90 (sedan)/V90 (wagon) from model year 1997 to 1998. * Volvo XC90 (second generation). * Mercedes-Benz Sprinter vans (front only, Hotchkiss in rear). * Opel GT: 1969‚Äì1973 (Front only), Trailing arm with coil springs, panhard bar (Rear). * Smart ForTwo Mk1-Mk3 (used with MacPherson Struts). * Volkswagen 1-litre car, prototype. * Indigo 3000, a Swedish made, low volume roadster. Due to the anti-roll properties of the transverse leaf-spring, the car does not employ a separate front anti-roll bar. * The Fiat 128 used a similar system with a more traditional multi-leaf steel spring but configured with two pivots to provide the anti-roll effect. * Some later models of Triumph Spitfire and Triumph GT6 used rear transverse steel leaf springs with anti-roll pivot mounts. * Transverse leaf spring and solid axle front suspension of early Ford cars.  Recent patents and related research  Several automotive companies have filed patents for suspension designs using a transverse composite leaf-spring supported in a fashion similar to that of the Corvette. * Ford Global Technologies, 2006, patent #7029017, Wheel suspension for a motor vehicle with a transverse leaf spring. * Porsche AG, 2000, patent # 6029987, Front Axle for a Motor Vehicle. Describes a strut suspension system supported by a transverse leaf-spring system largely the same as that used by the Corvette. The Porsche patent mentions the beneficial stabilizing effects of this arrangement. * Honda, 1992, Transverse leaf spring type suspension patent #5141209. * DaimlerChrysler, 2004, patent #6811169, Composite Spring Design that also Performs the Lower Control Arm Function for a Conventional or Active Suspension System. * ZF released a concept rear suspension design, in October 2009, using a composite spring-based rear suspension. The strut-based suspension uses a transverse leaf spring to function as both ride and anti- roll spring. The ZF concept differs from the system used on the Corvette by using the leaf spring as one of the suspension links.

He is known for his studies into the etiology of yellow fever. Nott, a slaveowner himself, used his scientific reputation to defend the institution of enslavement. He claimed that \\"the negro achieves his greatest perfection, physical and moral, and also greatest longevity, in a state of slavery\\". Nott was influenced by the racial theories of Samuel George Morton (1799-1851), one of the inspirators of physical anthropology. Morton collected hundreds of human skulls from around the world and tried to classify them. Morton had been among the first to claim that he could judge the intellectual capacity of a race by the cranial capacity (the measure of the volume of the interior of the skull). A large skull meant a large brain and high intellectual capacity, and a small skull indicated a small brain and decreased intellectual capacity. By studying these skulls he came to the conclusion of polygenism, that each race had a separate origin. Early life and education Born on March 31, 1804 in the U.S. state of South Carolina, Nott was the son of the Federalist politician and judge Abraham Nott. He received his medical degree from the University of Pennsylvania in 1827 and completed his post- graduate training in Paris, France. He moved to Mobile, Alabama in 1833 and began a surgical practice. Career Illustration from Indigenous Races of the Earth (1857), whose authors Nott and George Gliddon implied that \\"Negroes\\" were a creational rank between \\"Greeks\\" and chimpanzees. Nott took up theories that the mosquito was a vector for malaria, held by John Crawford and his contemporary Lewis Daniel Beauperthy. He is credited as being the first to apply the insect vector theory to yellow fever, then a serious health problem of the American South. In his 1850 Yellow Fever Contrasted with Bilious Fever he attacked the prevailing miasma theory. Nott lost four of his children to yellow fever in one week in September 1853. Morton's followers, particularly Nott and George Gliddon (1809‚Äì1857) in their monumental tribute to Morton's work, Types of Mankind (1854), carried Morton's ideas further and claimed and backed up his findings which supported the notion of polygenism, which claims that humanity originates from different lineages and is the ancestor of the multiregional hypothesis. In their book, Nott and Gliddon argued that the races of mankind occupied distinct zoological provinces and did not originate from a single pair, they both believed God had created each race and positioned each race in separate provinces. The doctrine of zoological provinces outlined in Types of Mankind did not allow for superiority of one type of race over another, each type was suited to its own province, and was superior in its own area. Nott claimed that because races were created in different provinces, that each race types must be of equal antiquity.David Keane, Caste-based discrimination in international human rights law, 2007, pp. 91-92 However Nott and other polygenists such as Gliddon believed that the biblical Adam means \\"to show red in the face\\" or \\"blusher\\"; since only light skinned people can blush, then the biblical Adam must be of the Caucasian race.Scott Mandelbrote, Nature and Scripture in the Abrahamic Religions: 1700‚Äìpresent), Volume 2, 2010. pp. 151 - 154 Nott persistently attacked the scientific basis of the Bible and also rejected the theory of evolution, claiming that the environment does not change any organism into another, and also rejecting common descent. Nott believed monogenism was \\"absurd\\" and had no biblical or scientific basis. He pointed to excavations in Egypt which depicted animals and humans as they looked today to refute monogenism and evolution. According to Nott, the monuments and artifacts found in Egypt show us that the \\"White, Mongolian and Negro existed at least five thousand years ago\\". Nott claimed that this proved beyond dispute that each race had been created separately. Nott claimed that the writers of the Bible had no knowledge of any races except themselves and their immediate neighbors, and that the Bible does not concern the whole of the earth's population. According to Nott there are no verses in the Bible which support monogenism and that the only passage the monogenists use is Acts 17:26, but according to Nott the monogenists are wrong in their interpretation of that verse because the \\"one blood\\" of Paul's sermon only includes the nations he knew existed, which were local. In 1856, Nott hired Henry Hotze to translate Arthur de Gobineau's An Essay on the Inequality of the Human Races (1853-55), a founding text of \\"biological racism\\" that contrasts with Boulainvilliers (1658‚Äì1722)'s theory of races and provided an appendix with the latest results. Gobineau subsequently complained that Hotze's translation had ignored his comments on \\"American decay generally and slaveholding in particular\\". In 1857, Nott and Gliddon again co-edited a book, Indigenous Races of the Earth.Indigenous Races of the Earth (Philadelphia 1857) That book built upon the arguments in Types of Mankind that linked anthropology and \\"scientific\\" studies of race to establish a supposed natural hierarchy of the races. The book included chapters from Louis Ferdinand Alfred Maury, J. Atkin Meigs, and Francis Polszky, letters from Louis Agassiz, Joseph Leidy, and A.W. Habersham. Charles Darwin opposed Nott and Gliddon's polygenist (and creationists) arguments in his 1871 The Descent of Man, arguing for a monogenism of the species. Darwin conceived the common origin of all humans (aka single-origin hypothesis) as essential for evolutionary theory. Darwin cited Nott and Gliddon's arguments as an example of those classing the races of man as separate species; Darwin disagreed and he concluded that humanity is one species. p. 217 Nott was a founder of the Medical College of Alabama, established in Mobile in 1858, and served as its Professor of Surgery. In 1860 he successfully appealed to the state legislature for a monetary appropriation and a state charter for the school. During the American Civil War he served as a Confederate surgeon and staff officer. During the early years of the war he served as director of the Confederate General Army Hospital in Mobile; later he served in the field as medical director on the staffs of Brig. Gen. Daniel Ruggles and Gen. Braxton Bragg, and hospital inspector. He lost both of his remaining sons to the war. Upon his own death in 1873 he was interred in Magnolia Cemetery in Mobile. Honors Honors Hall at The University of Alabama was previously named Nott Hall in honor of Nott, for his work at the predecessor Medical College of Alabama. This attracted controversy in 2016, with several student groups petitioning that either the building be renamed or an educational plaque be added due to Nott's open racism even by the standards of his era.Student group seeking change targets building namesakes with racist pastsWhy keep a KKK leader's name on a University of Alabama building?

It was released in October, 1999, by the Society of Automotive Engineers and the European Association of Aerospace Industries.Aerospace Industry Readies for the AS9100 AS9100 replaces the earlier AS9000 and fully incorporates the entirety of the current version of ISO 9001, while adding requirements relating to quality and safety. Major aerospace manufacturers and suppliers worldwide require compliance and/or registration to AS9100 as a condition of doing business with them.AS 9100 - Aerospace QualityAerospace AS9100, AS9110, AS9120 History Prior to development of AS9100 standards for Quality Management Systems, the U.S. military applied two specifications to supplier quality and inspection programs, respectively, MIL-Q-9858A, Quality Program Requirements, and MIL-I-45208A, Military Specification: Inspection System Requirements. For years these specifications had represented the basic tenets of the aerospace industry. However, when the U.S. government adopted ISO 9001, it withdrew those two quality standards. Large aerospace companies then began requiring their suppliers to develop quality programs based on ISO 9001. ; AS9000 (1997) Aerospace Basic Quality System Standard As aerospace suppliers soon found that ISO 9001 (1994) did not address the specific requirements of their customers, including the DoD, NASA, FAA and commercial, aerospace companies including Boeing, Lockheed Martin, Northrop Grumman, GE Aircraft Engines and Pratt & Whitney, they developed AS9000, based on ISO 9001, to provide a specific quality management standard for the aerospace industry. Prior to the adoption of an aerospace specific quality standard, various corporations typically used ISO 9001 and their own complementary quality documentation/requirements, such as Boeing's D1-9000 or the automotive Q standard. This created a patchwork of competing requirements that were difficult to enforce and/or comply with. The major American aerospace manufacturers combined their efforts to create a single, unified quality standard, based on ISO 9001:1994, resulting in AS9000. Upon the release of AS9000, companies such as Boeing discontinued use of their previous quality supplements in preference to compliance with AS9000. ; AS9100 (1999) Although AS9000 satisfied immediate needs, it was recognized that OEMs operate globally‚Äîa trend that would only increase, so a global standard was needed. The new standardized document, called 9100, was still based on ISO 9001:1994(E), although it was published separately by each country's aerospace association or standards body (AS9100 in the U.S). AS9100 added 55 aerospace industry specific amplifications and requirements to ISO 9001:1994. ; AS9100 Revision A (2001), Model for Quality Assurance in Design, Development, Production, Installation and Servicing During the rewrite of ISO 9001 for the year 2000 release, the AS group worked closely with the ISO organization. As the year 2000 revision of ISO 9001 incorporated major organizational and philosophical changes, AS9000 underwent a rewrite as well. It was released as AS9100 to the international aerospace industry at the same time as the new version of ISO 9001\\\\. AS9100A is actually two standards references in one publication; Section 1 defines an updated QMS model aligned with the updated ISO 9001:2000 publication while Section 2 defines a legacy model aligned with ISO 9001:1994. Organizations that in year 2001 were operating a QMS based on ISO 9001:1994 were permitted to conform to Section 2 with the expectation that they would then transition their QMS to Section 1.AS9100A, Model for Quality Assurance in Design, Development, Production, Installation and Servicing\\", SAE International Aerospace Standard , p. 2 ; AS9100 Revision B (2004), Quality Management Systems ‚Äì Aerospace Requirements As the period for transition from the 1994 to 2000 standards passed, AS9100B was released in 2004 as an administrative revision to delete Section 2 of the Revision A standard. ; AS9100 Revision C (2009), Quality Management System ‚Äì Requirements for Aviation, Space and Defense Organizations The update of AS9100 from revision B to C is largely to address the following question: ‚ÄúOur supplier is repeatedly late on delivery and failing to meet our requirements, how is it possible that they still have their AS9100 certificate?‚Äù That is, the AS9100C changes are driven by repeated delivery of non-conforming product and repeated late delivery by organizations that held AS9100A/B certifications. Those organizations had documented controls that conformed to the standard; however, there were insufficient processes in place to assure effectiveness of those controls. The response in this AS9100 revision is to elevate the requirements for Risk Management and to make Risk Management an integrated theme throughout the standard. A major challenge to AS9100B-compliant organizations was the new AS9100 auditing standards defined in AS9101 Revision D, which eliminates the clause-based compliance checklist and requires organizations to provide evidence of effectiveness of their systems and processes. Summary of Changes between AS9100B and AS9100C: * Greater Emphasis on Risk Management * Introduces ‚ÄúSpecial Requirements‚Äù * Introduces ‚ÄúCritical Items‚Äù * Measure: Requirements conformance * Measure: Delivery performance * Adopt Proven Product Development Processes * Eliminate ‚Äúrecurring corrective actions‚Äù AS9100 Revision C was released in January, 2009,SAE International Publications with considerable delay in application of the new version in audits, largely due to the delay in the release of AS9101 Revision D and auditor training to the increased auditing rigor of that update. ; AS9100 Revision D (2016), Quality Management System ‚Äì Requirements for Aviation, Space and Defense Organizations The update of AS9100 from revision C to D includes the full text of ISO 9001:2015. In addition to aligning the structure of the aviation, space and defense requirements to the new structure of ISO 9001:2015, the following key changes were implemented: * Product Safety was added in a new clause and in other areas * Counterfeit Parts Prevention was added in a new clause and in other areas (this was already in place in the AS9110 and AS9120 standards) * Risk clause was merged with the new ISO 9001 risk requirements along with an increased emphasis on risks in operational processes * Awareness clause was added with reinforced requirements for awareness of individual contribution to product and service quality and safety along with ethical behavior * Human Factors are included as a consideration in nonconformity management and corrective action * Configuration Management was clarified and improved to address stakeholder needs AS9100 Revision D was released in September 20, 2016SAE International Publications with a certificate transition period aligned with the ISO 9001:2015 transition.

Attack of the Eye Creatures [mistakenly stylised as Attack of Eye Creatures]) is a 1965 American made-for-TV science fiction/horror film about an unnamed countryside that is invaded by a flying saucer and its silent, shambling alien occupants. The Eye Creatures, an Azalea Pictures film, was directed by B-movie director/producer/auteur Larry Buchanan and starred John Ashley. The screenplay was developed by uncredited writers Robert J. Gurney Jr. and Al Martin from the short story \\"The Cosmic Frame\\" by Paul W. Fairman (also uncredited). The film was a color remake of the 1957 black and white American International Pictures film Invasion of the Saucer Men, intended to fill out a package of AIP films released to television. Plot A military briefing film shows a hovering flying saucer resembling a domed yo-yo as the narrator (Peter Graves) describes how the military's \\"Project Visitor\\" has been tracking it and anticipates it will land in the central United States. After the briefing, Lt. Robertson reports to the base near the expected target where he berates his subordinates for their habit of using the monitoring equipment to spy on teenagers making out in the woods. One of the teens sees an object land nearby and tells his friends at a local bar, including Stan Kenyon. Stan and his girlfriend Susan Rogers later accidentally hit one of the multi-eyed, lumpy greyish-white aliens from the ship with his car, so they drive off to call the police. Out in the woods, they are forced to use the phone of a grumpy local codger who resents the \\"smoochers\\" who use his property as a lovers' lane, frequently threatening them with a shotgun. Meanwhile, one of two drunken drifters new in town comes across the dead creature and decides to put it on exhibition as part of his latest get-rich-quick scheme. When he returns to the site after excitedly rushing home to tell his buddy Mike, other aliens arrive, scaring him and causing a deadly heart attack. When the police finally investigate, they assume that Stan has run over the drifter and arrest the young man, refusing to believe his crazy story. Having overheard the bar conversation about the UFO, Lt. Robertson reports to his commander, who reluctantly authorizes a cordon around the saucer. They eventually accidentally blow up the spaceship and congratulate themselves for their effective defense, not realizing that the creatures were not in their craft and are still roaming the woods. Easily escaping from the police, Stan and Susan meet up with the dead drifter's friend Mike and the three of them attempt to prove the alien danger to the community. Mike is cornered and attacked by the angry creatures, but Stan and Susan manage to flee and accidentally discover the monsters explode when exposed to bright light. Unfortunately, after the autopsy shows that the victim earlier died from an alcohol-induced heart attack and that Stan had not killed him, the police want nothing more to do with him and refuse to help. The teenagers then gather their friends together and drive out to the clearing where they left Mike. Surrounding the aliens with their cars, the teens use their headlights to evaporate the remaining creatures. Mike survives his attack, and Stan and Susan resume their interrupted plans to elope.

Ashley has stated that his salary took up more than half the budget. Most of the film was shot just outside Dallas at Cielo, a ranch owned by wealthy businessman Gordon McLendon. Ashley was the only professional actor, with the rest of the cast coming from Dallas theater. Ashley claimed that the film ranks \\"with some of the worst all-time horror films ever made... the monster looked like something out of the Michelin tire ad\\", but said it was a professional operation and that Buchanan treated him very well.Tom Weaver, \\"Interview with John Ashley\\", Interviews with B Science Fiction and Horror Movie Makers: Writers, Producers, Directors, Actors, Moguls and Makeup, McFarland 1988 p 40 Larry Buchanan later recalled: > We got John Ashley on the weekend that his wife Deborah Walley said goodbye > to him.

Deborah had gone over to Arkansas on an AlP publicity junket for one > of those \\"Beach Party\\" things, and John asked me ifhe could fly up and see > her.

Filming took two weeks. \\"Buchanan was a nice guy and it was a real 'at ease' pace,\\" said Ashley. \\"We just kind of worked until we felt like, 'Okay, that's enough.' It was a very small crew and quite well organized - Buchanan had it together.\\"Weaver p 40 The film's title screen contained a notable error. In keeping with a frequent practice of B-movie re-release retitling, the phrase \\"Attack of the\\" was superimposed on top of the original title, which already included \\"the\\", producing the redundant title Attack of the The Eye Creatures.* Reception Diabolique magazine said Ashley does \\"solid leading man work, grounding an outlandish premise, though by now he was far too old to play a teenager.\\" Mystery Science Theater 3000 Film-mocking television series Mystery Science Theater 3000 featured the oddly-titled print of the film, Attack of Eye Creatures, in a 1992 season 4 episode. In the MST3K version Joel riffs Rick Astley's song \\"Never Gonna Give You Up\\". Years later, the snippet surfaced on YouTube as \\"The first Rickroll\\". In the Mystery Science Theater 3000 episode featuring this film, Joel Robinson sarcastically suggested that \\"some eye creatures [‚Ä¶] are born with tight acrylic wool-blend turtleneck sweaters from Chess King\\". Crow T. Robot also mocked, \\"If you're ever in a fight with an eye creature, keep in mind that his head is simply draped casually over his shoulders and should be no trouble to knock off\\". [...] \\"Get ready to give chase to an injured eye creature; as you can see, he's wearing his Jack Purcell athletic shoes\\"! Crow even pointed out a shot featuring a common monster-film goof: \\"The eye creatures [‚Ä¶] were also unfortunate enough to have evolved with heavy-duty zippers running up their backs\\". Their riffing produced the fan-favorite phrase \\"They just didn't care\\", which was later applied to other features viewed on the show.

It is one of the most important Shia shrines in the world, built in 944. The dome was destroyed in a bombing by extremists in February 2006 and its two remaining minarets were destroyed in another bombing in June 2007, causing widespread anger among Shias. The remaining clock tower was also destroyed in July 2007. The dome and minarets were repaired and the mosque reopened in April 2009. The 10th and 11th Shƒ´'ite Imams, 'Alƒ´ al-HƒÅdƒ´ (\\"an-Naqƒ´\\") and his son Hasan al-'Askarƒ´, known as al-'Askariyyayn (\\"the two 'Askarƒ´s\\"), are buried in the shrine. Housed in the mosque are also the tombs of Hakimah KhƒÅt≈´n, sister of 'Alƒ´ al-HƒÅdƒ´; and Narjis KhƒÅt≈´n, the mother of Muƒßammad al- Mahdƒ´.Shrine of ImƒÅm al-HƒÅdƒ´ and ImƒÅm al-‚ÄòAskarƒ´ (ArchNet Digital Library) Adjacent to the mosque is another domed commemorative building, the Serdab (\\"cistern\\"), built over the cistern where the Twelfth Imam, Muƒßammad al-Mahdƒ´, first entered the Minor Occultation or \\"hidden from the view\\"‚Äîwhence the other title of the Mahdi, the Hidden Imam. History The Imams 'Alƒ´ al-HƒÅdƒ´ (\\"an- Naqƒ´\\") and Hassan al-'Askarƒ´ lived under house arrest in the part of Samarra that had been Caliph al-Mu'tasim's military camp ('Askar al-Mu‚Äòtasim, hence an inmate of the camp was called an Askarƒ´). As a result, they are known as the Askariyyayn. They died and were buried in their house on Abƒ´ Ahmad Street near the mosque built by Mu'tasim. A later tradition attributes their deaths to poison. Nasir ad-Din Shah Qajar undertook the latest remodelling of the shrine in 1868, with the golden dome added in 1905. Covered in 72,000 gold pieces and surrounded by walls of light blue tiles, the dome was a dominant feature of the Samarra skyline. It was approximately in diameter by high. Bombings=2006 attack On 22 February 2006, at 6:55 am local time (03:55 UTC) explosions occurred at the mosque, effectively destroying its golden dome and severely damaging the mosque. Several men belonging to Iraqi insurgent groups affiliated with Al-Qaida, one wearing a military uniform, had earlier entered the mosque, tied up the guards there and set explosives, resulting in the blast. Two bombs were set off by five to seven men dressed as personnel of the Iraqi Special Forces who entered the shrine during the morning. Time magazine reported at the time of the 2006 bombing that: 2007 attack At around 8 am on 13 June 2007, operatives belonging to al-Qaeda in Iraq destroyed the two remaining golden minarets flanking the dome's ruins. No fatalities were reported. Iraqi police reported hearing \\"two nearly simultaneous explosions coming from inside the mosque compound at around 8 am\\". A report from state- run Iraqiya Television stated that \\"local officials said that two mortar rounds were fired at the two minarets\\". Reopening In late 2007, the Iraqi government conducted a contract with a Turkish company to rebuild the shrine. The Iraqi government later cancelled the contract due to delays by the Turkish company. As of April 2009, the golden dome and the minarets have been restored and the shrine reopened to visitors. Gallery Samarra.pngThe Al- Askari Shrine in 1916.

It was built in 1996 and is managed by CapitaMall Trust. It is located next to Choa Chu Kang MRT/LRT and the Choa Chu Kang Bus Interchange. History Developed by City Developments Limited, Lot One was completed in August 1996 as the first major shopping mall in Choa Chu Kang. Like a typical suburban mall that time, it featured a Shaw Theatres cinema, an NTUC FairPrice supermarket, a Seiyu (now BHG) department store, the Choa Chu Kang Public Library, a Cathay bowling alley, a video games arcade, a Food Junction food court and slightly over 100 specialty shops. In 2005, the mall was sold to CapitaLand Ltd. In July 2007, the mall underwent its first renovation works, such as adding a four-storey retail extension and reconfiguring the shops in the mall. During this period, the food court was relocated from Basement 1 to Level 4, and the public library relocated from Level 3 to Level 4, taking over the former bowling alley. The arcade was re-allocated to a smaller space at Level 5 from Level 4. A roof garden, incorporating a wet and dry playground, was added during the final phase of the renovation. Renovation works were completed in November 2008. The mall is currently in the midst of major renovation works, scheduled to be completed by late 2021. During this period, the cinema, library, roof garden and some shops at the upper floors are currently closed. The cinema and library are expected to reopen in 2021 and 2022 respectively.

The PSA model assumes increasing prepayment rates for the first 30 months after mortgage origination and a constant prepayment rate thereafter. This approximates real-world experience that during the first few years, mortgage borrowers: * are less likely to relocate to a different home, * are less likely to refinance into a new mortgage, and * are less likely to make extra payments of principal. The standard model (also called \\"100% PSA\\") works as follows: Starting with an annualized prepayment rate of 0.2% in month 1, the rate increases by 0.2% each month, until it reaches 6% in month 30. From the 30th month onward, the model assumes an annualized prepayment rate of 6% of the remaining balance.Hayre, Lakhbir, Salomon Smith Barney Guide to Mortgage-Backed and Asset-Backed Securities (Wiley: 2001) , p. 24. Each monthly prepayment is assumed to represent full payoff of individual loans, rather than a partial prepayment that leaves a loan with a reduced principal balance. Variations of the model are expressed in percent; e.g., \\"150% PSA\\" means a monthly increase of 0.3% in the annualized prepayment rate, until the peak of 9% is reached after 30 months. The months thereafter have a constant annualized prepayment rate of 9%. 1667% PSA is roughly equivalent to 100% prepayment rate in month 30 or later.

It is immediately to the north of Hampstead Road Locks, a twin manually operated lock. The twin locks together are \\"Hampstead Road Lock 1\\"; each bears a sign so marked. Hawley Lock and Kentish Town Lock are a short distance away to the east; to the west is a long level pound (also known as tract or reach) -- it is to the next lock. History Regent's Canal was authorised by an Act of Parliament obtained on 13 July 1812, for a canal from Paddington to Limehouse. When the directors first met, they had decided that all locks would be paired, so that some of the water from a lock emptying could be used to fill the adjacent chamber. Water saving was an important factor, as they knew that water supply would be problematic. Colonel William Congreve, a military engineer who was later knighted, proposed the use of hydropneumatic boat lifts instead of locks. Various designs of a similar nature had been tried in the early nineteenth century, notably at Mells on the Dorset and Somerset Canal and at Tardebigge on the Worcester and Birmingham Canal, but none had proved successful. Congreve's design used two water-filled caissons, which were moved up and down by hand, assisted by compressed air trapped beneath the tanks. With no working examples of such lifts, the directors were understandably cautious, but following an engineer's report, decided that Maudslay & Co should build a prototype at Camden Town. There were a number of technical problems, with the canal company blaming Maudslays for poor design, and Maudslays blaming the canal company for changing the original design and failing to maintain the structure. Congreve's claim that it could be operated in just three minutes was never proved, and in 1818, the directors decided to cut their losses, and reverted to using paired locks. The lift was sold at auction in November 1819, and the 13 lots raised just ¬£404. A warm summer day at Camden Lock Construction of the canal was overseen by architect John Nash, with James Morgan acting as supervising engineer. Hampstead Road Locks were built between 1818 and 1820, with the chambers made of brick and stone coping along the top. The two locks are arranged side by side, with an island platform between them. Each chamber has two gates at both ends, and they have been Grade II listed since 1992 (this is the initial, most common category of listing). They were the first of 12 pairs of similar locks which dropped the level of the canal by to reach Limehouse Basin. The transfer of water between the chambers made operation of the locks more complex, and so they were permanently manned during the heyday of the canal, with lock-keepers working a shift system to provide 24-hour cover. As the use of the canal declined, in part due to railway competition, manning levels were reduced, and padlocks were used to prevent operation of the locks at the weekends. Following the end of commercial traffic and the growth of leisure boating, the locks reverted to operation by boat crews, and in order to prevent flooding caused by incorrect operation of the paddles, in the 1980s most of the pairs were converted to single locks, by replacing the lower gates of one chamber with a fixed weir. Hampstead Road Lock is the only one where both chambers have been retained, although they are now emptied conventionally. In November 2013, the locks were fully drained for maintenance; the public were invited for the weekend of the 16th and 17th of that month to see the infrastructure for themselves. Camden Lock panorama at sunset. The lock is to the west of the Camden High Street road bridge. When the canal was built, the road was carried over it by a brick bridge, but this was found to be inadequate, and was replaced by a cast iron girder bridge in 1878. The cost was met by the St Pancras Vestry and the Metropolitan Board of Works, and the bridge, which has brick abutments with stone coping, carries a plaque recording this fact. Like the lock, it is Grade II listed. At the south-east corner of the lock is a building dating from 1815, which was originally constructed to house air compressors for Congreve's boat lift. It was subsequently used as the lock keeper's cottage, and by 2010 had become a Starbucks coffee shop. The building was extended in 1975, when it was also stuccoed, and a crenellated parapet was added. To the west of the lock is a cast iron roving bridge, dating from the early or mid nineteenth century. It had wrought iron tension stays when built, but these were replaced by steel cables in the late twentieth century, when the deck was also replaced. The towpath is on the northern bank of the canal at this point, and is carried over the entrance to a dock which formed part of Camden Goods Depot by a cast iron single span bridge with stone capped abutments. It was constructed by J Deeley and Co, of Newport in Monmouthshire between 1848 and 1856. The granite setts which form the approach ramps were taken up and relaid in 1978. Camden Goods Depot Camden Goods Depot was the London freight terminus of the London and Birmingham Railway, the first inter-city railway to reach London. Robert Stephenson was the engineer in charge of the project, and he picked the site for the goods depot so that direct interchange with the Regent's Canal was available, from where freight could reach the London docks. A site on the north bank of the canal was obtained from Lord Southampton in January 1837, and the goods depot was completed in 1839. Major features were a stationary winding engine house, which was used to pull trains up the incline from to Camden, a shed for stabling of locomotives, 18 coke ovens which were used to make smokeless fuel, two goods sheds, stables for 50 horses, a wagon repair shop, and various ancillary buildings. Much of the site was supported on brick vaults. Pickfords, the public carrier, built a warehouse on the south bank of the canal in 1841. It was designed by William Cubitt, was extended in 1846, and was the first rail, road and canal interchange building in Britain, being linked to the goods depot by a wooden railway bridge over the canal. The Interchange building, where goods were transferred to canal boats, is now the offices of Associated Press Television News. In 1846, the London and Birmingham Railway merged with several other railway companies to become the London and North Western Railway (LNWR). Just prior to the merger, they decided to build their own interchange facilities, rather than using Pickfords, and this was carried out by the LNWR. Semple's Wharf, on the north bank of the canal, was purchased, and the towpath bridge was built by 1846. A basin and dock were built once the sale of the wharf was completed in 1847, and a new rail link to the goods depot was added. As part of this expansion, two new engine sheds were built, one to the north of the tracks for goods locomotives, and one to the south for passenger locomotives. The southern shed was demolished in 1966, but the northern one, known as the Roundhouse, is Grade II* listed. A second wooden railway bridge crossed the canal to the former Pickfords warehouse. Following the construction on lines to link to the East India and West India Docks in 1851, which became the North London Railway in 1853, further upgrading of the goods depot was necessary to cope with the volumes of traffic. This took place between 1854 and 1856, and included the enlargement and realignment of the canal basin. When completed, it was with railway tracks on both sides running to the edge of the canal. Four new stable blocks were built next to the Hampstead Road, and the complex was linked to the marshalling yards by the Eastern Horse Tunnel. A Western Horse Tunnel was also built to link the goods depot to new stables near the present Gloucester Avenue, to the west of the mainline tracks. In 1864, the LNWR built a new goods shed, at the time the largest in the country, and in 1876, additional stables were built to the north of Gloucester Avenue. Access to the Western Horse Tunnel was by a set of horse stairs, which have survived. The LNWR good shed was enlarged in 1931, but subsequently demolished. The goods depot closed around 1980, and many of the stables were demolished in 2000. The Interchange Warehouse was remodelled in 1989, to become offices, and further restoration work occurred in 2007, when some of the later additions were removed. It is now known as The Interchange. Despite some demolition, the complex of buildings, which includes parts of the goods depot, the winding engine house, the Roundhouse, the eastern portal of Primrose Hill railway tunnel, and the canal, represent one of the most important groupings of nineteenth century transport infrastructure to have survived in Britain. The survival of the horse tunnel and stairs shows the importance of horse-drawn transport in the developing railway system. Camden Lock Commercial traffic on the Regent's Canal had almost ceased by the late 1960s, and the area had become run down. Much of the industry had moved away, partly as a result of the passing of the Clean Air Act 1956, but also helped by government grants to encourage companies to move away from the city. The area around Hampstead Road Locks was populated by disused warehouses, derelict land and a towpath which desperately needed some repairs to be made. In addition, the area was blighted by the proposed London Motorway Box, which would have seen much of the canal culverted, and a sliproad built over the site of the locks. To the north of the lock was a wharf, owned by British Waterways, but rented out to Dingwall's since 1946. The company made packing cases, but their business had been hit by the change to containers, and in 1971 they decided to sell up. They had about ten years left on a twenty-five year lease. The lease was bought by Northside Developments, a limited company which had been formed by Bill Fulford and Peter Wheeler, and had previously been involved in turning large houses into flats in south London. Their proposal for the yard was to create workshops, where people worked and sold their produce. They also hoped the development would include a restaurant and cinema. They approached Camden Council, who had wanted to bulldoze the whole area, and persuaded them that some of the heritage assets were worth saving. Northside were advised against including a market in their planning application by the council, and in April 1972 received planning permission for a temporary development, lasting three years, by which time the outcome of the motorway scheme would be known. With such a short lease, funding the scheme had its problems, and several joint companies were created to divide the investment into smaller packets. The plans included workshops, restaurants, sculpture studios, a snack bar, a mooring area for canal boats, and an office. The lease was soon extended to run until 1980, but Northside were refused permission to run a market on Saturdays in the yard and on Commercial Place, the road from which access to the site was gained. On a very limited budget of ¬£5,000, Northside set about converting the existing buildings into craft workshops. No new buildings were erected, as the whole area was still scheduled for demolition. By mid-1972, parts of the West Yard were ready to be used as workshops, and businesses began to occupy them. An official opening was held on 4 April 1973, with the Mayor of Camden presiding, and this was followed by a three-day display of work by the fifty people who were by then occupying the workshops. Plans for the motorway were dropped soon afterwards. Northside then obtained a development lease, but applications to demolish and replace many of the buildings were successfully resisted by a tenants' association, formed by the craft workers. Newspapers reported the conflicts, and the publicity drew in visitors from a much wider area. The North London line railway bridge over Chalk Farm Road from Camden Lock Place, a pedestrian-only road with open-air and permanent stalls, and entrances to some of the Camden markets The towpath through the area of Hampstead Road Locks was upgraded and a formal opening was held on 20 May 1972. The next major development was Dingwall's Dance Hall, which occupied the former warehouse used by the packing case company and opened in June 1973. It featured live music, and in order to stay open until 2am, the terms of the licence required an entrance fee to be charged, which was set at 50 pence by the licensing authority. Regular customers included David Hockney, Lucien Freud and George Melly, and it soon became well known as a venue for punk rock bands. Northside next obtained permission to run a Saturday antiques market in January 1974. It would run through the summer months of that year only, with a maximum of 60 stalls, set out in the yard and in a corrugated iron shed. When it opened, there were 12 stallholders, but this soon increased to 30. Better access to the canal towpath was created by knocking a hole in the wall that separated it from the East Yard. The towpath from London Zoo to Camden High Street was then opened for public access, following a campaign by the Regent's Canal Group. The market was a success, and within a year Northside had obtained permission to extend it to Sundays and Bank Holidays. Soon there were two restaurants on the site, and the range of goods for sale on the stalls became much wider. In the 1976 Conservation Awards run by The Times newspaper and the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors, the market came joint third. By the early 1980, the market consisted of nearly 200 stalls, which were occupied by around 100 regular stallholders and many temporary ones. It attracted around 11,000 visitors each weekend. In addition, there were 39 businesses based in the craft workshops. Northside now decided that it was time to change the name of the access road from Commercial Place. The area had been known informally as Camden Lock for some time, and so they campaigned for it to become Camden Lock Place. Despite objections from the fire brigade, the Greater London Council eventually sanctioned the name change, and from then on, the site was marketed as Camden Lock. It became a venue for events, including a five-week Festival of Entertainment, a Clock Festival, and Gerry Cottle's Circus was also booked. British Rail carried out repairs to the railway bridge over Chalk Farm Road in the mid 1980s, and when the work was completed, the hoardings were not replaced. After long negotiations, Northside were granted permission to paint the bridge in 1989, and employed mural artist John Bulley to paint the words Camden Lock in giant letters on the superstructure, together with representations of two painters, painting the letters. Development By the late 1980s, Camden Lock was attracting increasing numbers of foreign tourists to the market. In the early days, the emphasis had been on hand-crafted goods, but there was a steady increase in mass-produced goods on sale, and some concern locally that Camden Town would be taken over by tourists, and lose its local amenities. Some of the craft units had become retail shops, and there was a problem with the large amount of litter that the market produced. Northside's lease only ran to the end of the 1980s, and so they proposed a ¬£10 million redevelopment, jointly managed by UK Land Limited. They promised new shops, a new pub, and a new market yard, which would be open throughout the week, rather than just at weekends. The plans included a Victorian style retail hall, which would provide indoor accommodation for some of the market. A four-storey building was erected, fronting Chalk Farm Road, and the space between it and Dingwalls, which had been the site of the original market in the 1970s, was covered by a glazed cast iron and brick structure the designs for which were based on a Victorian gas showroom. Dingwalls Dance Hall was refurbished, and a comedy club was built in the East Yard. The second phase of redevelopment began after the bridge sign had been painted. In January 1990 the mural was awarded an environment award by the Evening Standard, which declared it to be \\"a credit to London\\". Despite the increased timescales and costs of doing so, Northside attempted to redevelop the East Yard without closing the market, in order to retain its vibrancy. The work was completed by the summer of 1991, and although there were detractors and accusations of commercialism, it proved to be a success. Some 10 million people were visiting the various Camden markets each year, generating a turnover of an estimated ¬£50 million. During the week, trade in the market hall was slow, as few market traders wanted to be there all week, but Northside suggested that the traders form small co-operatives, and offered discounts for those that did so. This resulted in all of the traders being there at the weekends, but them taking it in turns to look after groups of stalls during the week. The former Dingwalls yard is now known as Camden Lock Market, and is one of a group of five markets in the vicinity which are collectively called Camden Market. It is a busy market which attracts many visitors, and with music venues, cafes and canal towpath walks, it has become one of London's most popular tourist destinations. There are a number of art installations in the area, including a large cut-steel sculpture by English artist Edward Dutkiewicz in the square beside the lock.

Fleeing fox spirit as Lady Kay≈ç depicted in Hokusai's Sangoku Y≈çko-den (‰∏âÂõΩÂ¶ñÁãê‰ºù) In the story told by Hokusai, formed in the Edo period, the nine-tail fox first appeared in China and possessed Daji, concubine of Shang dynasty's last ruler King Zhou. She enchanted the king and brought upon a reign of terror that led to a rebellion that ended the Shang dynasty. The fox spirit fled to Magadha of Tianzhu (ancient India) and became Lady Kay≈ç (ËèØÈôΩÂ§´‰∫∫), concubine of the crown prince Banzoku (Áè≠Ë∂≥Â§™Â≠ê; based on Indian tales of Kalmashapada the man-eaterFerguson, p. 3 note 3), causing him to cut off the heads of 1000 men. It was then defeated again, and fled the country. Around 780 BC, the same fox returned to China was said to have possessed Bao Si, concubine of the Zhou dynasty King You. It was again chased away by human military forces. The fox stayed quiet for some period. Then she appeared in Japan as Tamamo-no-Mae, the most favoured courtesan of Emperor Toba. She was said to be a most beautiful and intelligent woman, being able to answer any question asked. She caused the Emperor to be extremely ill and was eventually exposed as a fox spirit by the astrologer Abe no Yasuchika, who had been called to diagnose the cause of the Emperor's poor health.

He is most associated with two of the UK's best known and influential punk bands, the Sex Pistols and The Clash. Rhodes was responsible for discovering John Lydon and arranging his audition in the King's Road which led to him joining the Sex Pistols. He introduced Joe Strummer to Mick Jones and Paul Simonon, who with Keith Levene then formed The Clash. Rhodes was an important force behind The Clash not only managing their business but also guiding their marketing and creative direction.Knowles(2003). p. 121. Disagreement with the group about direction led to his sacking by the Clash in 1979. Rhodes meantime continued with other successful signings to his label Oddball Productions and major record companies. In 1981 singer Joe Strummer demanded his return to the Clash or he would quit the group. Rhodes nurtured and managed other bands including Subway Sect, The Specials, Dexys Midnight Runners, Jo Boxers, The Lous, The Black Arabs, Twenty Flight Rockers, and Watts from Detroit. During this period Rhodes built and operated from his Camden studio Rehearsal Rehearsals, in what became Camden Market. The area around the studio became a well known hangout for punks and contributed to the growth of Camden as a hip area. He is also known in Brazil for his friendship with Supla and baptising the band ‚ÄúBrothers of Brazil‚Äù.  Early life  Bernard Rhodes was raised in Stepney, east London. He says he never knew his father. He was placed in a Jewish orphanage in South London where he remained until he was 15. His mother worked long hours for Huntsman's tailors in Saville Row making suits for people like Cary Grant and later Hawes & Curtis where Rhodes friend John Pearse who co-owned Granny Takes A Trip was her apprentice. In the early 1960s Rhodes and Pearse shared a flat at 68 Hamilton Terrace, St Johns Wood, London. Mick Jagger, Marc Bolan, musician Mickey Finn, the Small Faces and Guy Stevens (who Rhodes later brought in to produce The Clash) were regular visitors.  Early career  Towards the late 1960s Rhodes won a Design Council award for a children's educational toy he designed using newly developed plastic techniques. In the early 1970s Rhodes had a shop in the Antiquarius Market, Chelsea selling his hand printed silk screen designs on shirts and T-shirts, plus a selection of rare vintage reggae records. During this period he became re-acquainted with an old friend, Malcolm McLaren and his girlfriend Vivienne Westwood who were operating out of Let It Rock boutique at 430 Kings Road. Finding they shared a similar philosophy, Rhodes and McLaren went into business collaborating on the T-shirts which were sold in the shop. Westwood wanted to expand the sleeveless T-shirt clothing line and Rhodes was an ideal colleague with his silk screen printing skill and whose 'complex meandering discourse threw up many new ideas'. The T-shirt 'You're Gonna Wake Up One Morning and Know What Side of The Bed You've Been Lying On' was created and printed by Rhodes and uses his handwriting.Rimmer, Dave. New Romantics: The Look. Omnibus Press, 2003. ASIN: B00GS97DIY McLaren explained that Rhodes idea was 'to create a dialogue'. Rhodes has described the difference between himself and McLaren: 'Malcolm [McLaren] likes to titillate but I get down to substance'.  Sex Pistols  By 1975, SEX had become a hangout for a bunch of teenagers from whom the Sex Pistols would emerge. Rhodes took the group under his wing while McLaren was in New York looking after the New York Dolls. Original Sex Pistols member Glen Matlock describes Rhodes contribution as making them understand the importance of being clear cut. 'He (Rhodes) had a real ability for making people decide exactly what they were trying to do.' John Lydon states that he was wearing a 'I Hate Pink Floyd' T-shirt when he was spotted by Rhodes on the Kings Road. Rhodes insisted he meet McLaren, Steve Jones and Paul Cook in the local Roebuck pub that evening. After this get together, Rhodes had Lydon come back to the shop to audition for the role of singer. As a result, Lydon became lead singer of the group. Lydon says that Rhodes \\"was important to me in so many ways...He would indicate to me where the problems with the Pistols would be in the future. He would sow a seed and then wait to see if I would pick up on it.  The Clash  After his offer to co-manage Sex Pistols was rejected by McLaren, Rhodes was instrumental in The Clash's formation in 1976. Mick Jones was wearing one of Rhodes' Wake Up T-shirts when he approached Rhodes after a Sex Pistols gig thinking he was a keyboard player. They started talking about groups and the relationship was the starting point for what would eventually become The Clash. Strummer credits Rhodes as his mentor, stating \\"He constructed The Clash and focused our energies and we repaid him by being really good at what we did\\". Rhodes told them to write about social issues occurring at the time, i.e., the housing problems, lack of education, dead-end futures. Strummer said that Rhodes was the only one who understood how one should go about getting known. Paul Simonon stated that Rhodes \\"set up the whole punk scene basically. He saw how non-musicians like myself and John (Lydon) could contribute\\". Rhodes called his friend Guy Stevens in, to produce the Polydor recordings in 1977. The group later used Stevens to produce London Calling. He also sought out Lee 'Scratch' Perry to produce the single \\"Complete Control\\". On 25 January 1977, Rhodes signed The Clash to CBS Records with CBS Records UK chairman Maurice Oberstein who promised to allow the group to do what they wanted on record and CBS would promote it. After a couple of albums, including their first, which Rhodes helped produce with Mickey Foote, he felt the group were drifting away from their street ideals and they parted company in late 1978.  1979‚Äì1981  From his Rehearsal Rehearsals studio, Rhodes nurtured and managed groups Subway Sect, The Specials, Dexys Midnight Runners, The Black Arabs and other musical projects. The intro to The Specials' version of \\"Gangsters\\" released in 1979 begins with the line: \\"Bernie Rhodes knows: don't argue!\\". Dexys Midnight Runners' single \\"Dance Stance\\" was released in 1979 on the Oddball Productions label owned by Rhodes . Rhodes later signed the group to EMI Records. The first album by Subway Sect, What's the Matter Boy, was produced by Rhodes and released by Oddball in 1980. Rhodes also introduced the idea of using a Burundi drum beat to Malcolm McLaren who gave it to Adam Ant. This led to the sound of Kings of the Wild Frontier (1980) by Adam and the Ants.  Club Left  During the late seventies he opened Club Left in Wardour Street Soho. Club Left performances included Dig Wayne, Tom Cat, Lady Blue, Johnny Britton, Sade, Bananarama, Georgie Fame and Slim Gaillard. The regular house band was Vic Godard and the Subway Sect. Sean McLusky said that Rhodes gave him a break at Club Left in 1981 and then got a deal and success for his band JoBoxers, who enjoyed mainstream success on both sides of the Atlantic with their single \\"Just Got Lucky\\". McLusky says, \\"Bernard never got the credit for things that were his. He has been the undefined force\\".  Return to the Clash  Strummer said if Rhodes did not come back and manage the Clash he would quit. Once back, Rhodes decided to remix \\"Magnificent 7\\". A 12\\" single dance remix \\"Magnificent Dance\\" was released on 12 April 1981. Production was credited to 'Pepe Unidos', a pseudonym for Strummer, Rhodes and Paul Simonon. Pepe Unidos also produced \\"The Cool Out\\", a re-mix of \\"The Call Out\\".  Bonds NYC  Mick Jones said 'Bernie came back on the scene because people thought that we'd gotten out of control and the first thing he wanted to do was book us for seven nights in New York'. The residency at Bonds NYC in the first two weeks of June 1981 was organised by Rhodes on his return as manager of The Clash. Support acts included Grandmaster Flash, The Sugarhill Gang, Dead Kennedys, Bad Brains, Texan bad boy Joe Ely, Lee Perry and Funkapolitan. Rhodes states that it was because of these Bonds NYC shows that the public became more interested in hip-hop. \\"I endeavoured to get these guys on like Grandmaster Flash; not that most of the audience liked them but that led to a helluvalot\\". The record company were not behind the triple album Sandinista! recorded in Rhodes's absence but Kosmo Vinyl states that with the Bonds NYC residency, The Clash \\"clawed their way back into the Premiership\\".  Jones‚Äô sacking  Paul Simonon states that Rhodes was not aware he and Joe were going to sack Mick Jones nor was he in favour of that action. (The sacking took place in 1983). However Simenon says Jones did not know this until the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame induction after Joe Strummer's death.

Rhodes brought in a new bass player and rehearsed the band over several months. He independently produced the album 'Green with Rage', and secured a deal for the band with Sony Records. Recent In 2014 Rhodes designed a range of biker T-shirts for Lewis Leathers Britain's oldest Motorcycle Clothing Company. In May 2016, the British Library invited him to give a talk entitled Me, Punk and the World as part of its Punk 1976-78 exhibit. ReferencesSources ;Books   Jucha, Gary.

Criticisms include positions based on the history of science, philosophical and logical criticisms, findings in the natural sciences, theistic apologetic arguments, arguments pertaining to ethics and morality, the effects of atheism on the individual, or the assumptions that underpin atheism. Various contemporary agnostics like Carl Sagan and theists such as Dinesh D'Souza have criticised atheism for being an unscientific position. Analytic philosopher Alvin Plantinga, Professor of Philosophy Emeritus at the University of Notre Dame, argues that a failure of theistic arguments might conceivably be good grounds for agnosticism, but not for atheism; and points to the observation of an apparently \\"fine-tuned universe\\" as more likely to be explained by theism than atheism. Oxford Professor of Mathematics John Lennox holds that atheism is an inferior world view to that of theism and attributes to C.S. Lewis the best formulation of Merton's thesis that science sits more comfortably with theistic notions on the basis that Men became scientific in Western Europe in the 16th and 17th century \\"[b]ecause they expected law in nature, and they expected law in nature because they believed in a lawgiver.' In other words, it was belief in God that was the motor that drove modern science\\". American geneticist Francis Collins also cites Lewis as persuasive in convincing him that theism is the more rational world view than atheism. Other criticisms focus on perceived effects on morality and social cohesion. The Enlightenment philosopher Voltaire, a deist, saw godlessness as weakening \\"the sacred bonds of society\\", writing: \\"If God did not exist, it would be necessary to invent him\\". The father of classical liberalism, John Locke, believed that the denial of God's existence would undermine the social order and lead to chaos. Edmund Burke, an 18th-century Irish philosopher and statesman praised by both his conservative and liberal peers for his \\"comprehensive intellect\\", saw religion as the basis of civil society and wrote that \\"man is by his constitution a religious animal; that atheism is against, not only our reason, but our instincts; and that it cannot prevail long\\". Pope Pius XI wrote that Communist atheism was aimed at \\"upsetting the social order and at undermining the very foundations of Christian civilization\\". In the 1990s, Pope John Paul II criticised a spreading \\"practical atheism\\" as clouding the \\"religious and moral sense of the human heart\\" and leading to societies which struggle to maintain harmony. The advocacy of atheism by some of the more violent exponents of the French Revolution, the subsequent militancy of Marxist‚ÄìLeninist atheism and prominence of atheism in totalitarian states formed in the 20th century is often cited in critical assessments of the implications of atheism. In his Reflections on the Revolution in France, Burke railed against \\"atheistical fanaticism\\". The 1937 papal encyclical Divini Redemptoris denounced the atheism of the Soviet Union under Joseph Stalin, which was later influential in the establishment of state atheism across Eastern Europe and elsewhere, including Mao Zedong's China, Kim's North Korea and Pol Pot's Cambodia. Critics of atheism often associate the actions of 20th-century state atheism with broader atheism in their critiques. Various poets, novelists and lay theologians, among them G. K. Chesterton and C.S. Lewis, have also criticized atheism. For example, a quote often attributed to Chesterton holds that \\"[h]e who does not believe in God will believe in anything\\".  Definitions and concepts  Atheism is the absence of belief that any gods exist, the position that there are no gods, or the rejection of belief in the existence of gods.* *(page 175 in 1967 edition) Deism is a form of theism in which God created the universe and established rationally comprehensible moral and natural laws but does not intervene in human affairs through special revelation. Deism is a natural religion where belief in God is based on application of reason and evidence observed in the designs and laws found in nature. Christian deism refers to a deist who believes in the moral teachings but not the divinity of Jesus.  Arguments and positions The last 50 years has seen an increase in academic philosophical arguments critical of the positions of atheism arguing that they are philosophically unsound. Some of the more common of these arguments are the presumption of atheism, the logical argument from evil, the evidential argument from evil, the argument from nonbelief and absence of evidence arguments. The Presumption of Atheism Antony Garrard Newton Flew Authored The Presumption of Atheism in 1976214x214px In 1976, atheist philosopher Antony Flew wrote The Presumption of Atheism in which he argued that the question of God's existence should begin by assuming atheism as the default position. According to Flew, the norm for academic philosophy and public dialogue was at that time for atheists and theists to both share their respective \\"burdens of proof\\" for their positions. Flew proposed instead that his academic peers redefine \\"atheism\\" to bring about these changes: Flew's proposition saw little acceptance in the 20th century though in the early 21st century Flew's broader definition of atheism came to be forwarded more commonly. In 2007, analytic philosopher William Lane Craig's described the presumption of atheism as \\"one of the most commonly proffered justifications of atheism\\". In 2010, BBC journalist William Crawley explained that Flew's presumption of atheism \\"made the case, now followed by today's new atheism\\" arguing that atheism should be the default position. In today's debates, atheists forward the presumption of atheism arguing that atheism is the default position with no burden of proof and assert that the burden of proof for God's existence rests solely on the theist. The presumption of atheism has been the subject of criticism by atheists,. agnostics and theists since Flew advanced his position more than 40 years ago. =Criticism of the presumption of atheism= The agnostic Analytic Philosopher Anthony Kenny rejected the presumption of atheism on any definition of atheism arguing that \\"the true default position is neither theism nor atheism, but agnosticism\\" adding \\"a claim to knowledge needs to be substantiated, ignorance need only be confessed\\". 160x160px Atheist philosopher Kai Nielsen criticized the presumption of atheism arguing that without an independent concept of rationality or a concept of rationality that atheists and theists can mutually accept, there is no common foundation on which to adjudicate rationality of positions concerning the existence of God. Because the atheist's conceptualization of \\"rational\\" differs from the theist, Nielsen argues, both positions can be rationally justified. Analytic philosopher and modal logician Alvin Plantinga, a theist, rejected the presumption of atheism forwarding a two-part argument. First, he shows that there is no objection to belief in God unless the belief is shown to be false. Second, he argues that belief in God could be rationally warranted if it is a properly basic or foundational belief through an innate human \\"sense of the divine\\". Plantinga argues that if we have the innate knowledge of God which he theorizes as a possibility, we could trust belief in God the same way we trust our cognitive faculties in other similar matters, such as our rational belief that there are other minds beyond our own, something we believe, but for which there can be no evidence. Alvin Plantinga's argument puts theistic belief an equal evidential footing with atheism even if Flew's definition of atheism is accepted. University of Notre Dame philosopher Ralph McInerny goes further than Plantinga, arguing that belief in God reasonably follows from our observations of the natural order and the law-like character of natural events. McInerny argues that the extent of this natural order is so pervasive as to be almost innate, providing a prima facie argument against atheism. McInerny's position goes further than Plantinga's, arguing that theism is evidenced and that the burden of proof rests on the atheist, not on the theist.257x257pxWilliam Lane Craig wrote that if Flew's broader definition of atheism is seen as \\"merely the absence of belief in God\\", atheism \\"ceases to be a view\\" and \\"even infants count as atheists\\". For atheism to be a view, Craig adds: \\"One would still require justification in order to know either that God exists or that He does not exist\\". Like the agnostic Anthony Kenny, Craig argues that there is no presumption for atheism because it is distinct from agnosticism: Forty years after Flew published The Presumption of Atheism, his proposition remains controversial. Other arguments William Lane Craig listed some of the more prominent arguments forwarded by proponents of atheism along with his objections: *\\"The Hiddenness of God\\" is the claim that if God existed, God would have prevented the world's unbelief by making his existence starkly apparent. Craig argues that the problem with this argument is that there is no reason to believe that any more evidence than what is already available would increase the number of people believing in God. *\\"The Incoherence of Theism\\" is the claim that the notion of God is incoherent. Craig argues that a coherent doctrine of God's attributes can be formulated based on scripture like Medieval theologians had done and \\"Perfect Being Theology\\"; and that the argument actually helps in refining the concept of God. *\\"The Problem of Evil\\" can be split into two different concerns: the \\"intellectual\\" problem of evil concerns how to give a rational explanation of the co-existence of God and evil and the \\"emotional\\" problem of evil concerns how to comfort those who are suffering and how to dissolve the emotional dislike people have of a God who would permit such evil. The latter can be dealt with in a diverse manner. Concerning the \\"intellectual\\" argument, it is often cast as an incompatibility between statements such as \\"an omnipotent, omnibenevolent God exists\\" and \\"the quantity and kinds of suffering in the world exist\\". Craig argues that no one has shown that both statements are logically incompatible or improbable with respect to each other. Others use another version of the intellectual argument called the \\"evidential problem of evil\\" which claims that the apparently unnecessary or \\"gratuitous\\" suffering in the world constitutes evidence against God's existence. Craig argues that it is not clear that the suffering that appears to be gratuitous actually is gratuitous for various reasons, one of which is similar to an objection to utilitarian ethical theory, that it is quite simply impossible for us to estimate which action will ultimately lead to the greatest amount of happiness or pleasure in the world. T.J. Mawson makes a case against atheism by citing some lines of evidence and reasoning such as the high level of fine-tuning whereby the life of morally sentient and significantly free creatures like humans has implications. On the maximal multiverse hypothesis, he argues that in appealing to infinite universes one is in essence explaining too much and that it even opens up the possibility that certain features of the universe still would require explanation beyond the hypothesis itself. He also argues from induction for fine tuning in that if one supposed that infinite universes existed there should be infinite ways in which observations can be wrong on only one way in which observations can be right at any point in time, for instance, that the color of gems stay the same every time we see them. In other words, if infinite universes existed, then there should be infinite changes to our observations of the universe and in essence be unpredictable in infinite ways, yet this is not what occurs.  Atheism and the individual  In a global study on atheism, sociologist Phil Zuckerman noted that though there are positive correlations with societal health among organically atheist nations, countries with higher levels of atheism also had the highest suicide rates compared to countries with lower levels of atheism. He concludes that correlation does not necessarily indicate causation in either case. Another study found similar trends. A 2004 study of religious affiliation and suicide attempts, concluded: \\"After other factors were controlled, it was found that greater moral objections to suicide and lower aggression level in religiously affiliated subjects may function as protective factors against suicide attempts\\". According to William Bainbridge, atheism is common among people whose social obligations are weak and is also connected to lower fertility rates in some industrial nations. Extended length of sobriety in alcohol recovery is related positively to higher levels of theistic belief, active community helping and self-transcendence. Some studies state that in developed countries health, life expectancy and other correlates of wealth tend to be statistical predictors of a greater percentage of atheists, compared to countries with higher proportions of believers.Paul, Gregory. 2002. The Secular Revolution of the West, Free Inquiry, Summer: 28‚Äì34 Multiple methodological problems have been identified with cross-national assessments of religiosity, secularity and social health which undermine conclusive statements on religiosity and secularity in developed democracies.  Morality  The liberal philosopher John Locke believed that the denial of God's existence would undermine the social order and lead to chaos The influential deist philosopher Voltaire criticised established religion to a wide audience, but conceded a fear of the disappearance of the idea of God: \\"After the French Revolution and its outbursts of atheism, Voltaire was widely condemned as one of the causes\\", wrote Geoffrey Blainey. \\"Nonetheless, his writings did concede that fear of God was an essential policeman in a disorderly world: 'If God did not exist, it would be necessary to invent him', wrote Voltaire\\".Geoffrey Blainey; A Short History of Christianity; Viking; 2011; pp.390-391 In A Letter Concerning Toleration, the influential English philosopher John Locke wrote: \\"Promises, covenants, and oaths, which are the bonds of human society, can have no hold upon an atheist. The taking away of God, though but even in thought, dissolves all\\".John Locke A Letter Concerning Toleration; Translated by William Popple Although Locke was believed to be an advocate of tolerance, he urged the authorities not to tolerate atheism because the denial of God's existence would undermine the social order and lead to chaos.Jeremy Waldron; God, Locke, and Equality: Christian Foundations in Locke's Political Thought; Cambridge, UK; 2002; p.217 According to Dinesh D'Souza, Locke, like Russian novelist Fyodor Dostoyevsky after him, argued that \\"when God is excluded, then it is not surprising when morality itself is sacrificed in the process and chaos and horror is unleashed on the world\\".Dinesh D'Souza. \\"Answering Atheist's Arguments.\\"; tothesource (December 6, 2006). The Catholic Church believes that morality is ensured through natural law, but that religion provides a more solid foundation.Josef Cardinal Ratzinger, Marcello Pera, \\"Without Roots: The West, Relativism, Christianity, Islam\\" (Basic Books, 0465006345, 2006). For many years in the United States, atheists were not allowed to testify in court because it was believed that an atheist would have no reason to tell the truth (see also discrimination against atheists).See, e.g., United States v. Miller, 236 F. 798, 799 (W.D. Wash., N.D. 1916) (citing Thurston v. Whitney et al., 2 Cush. (Mass.) 104; Jones on Evidence, Blue Book, vol. 4, ¬ß¬ß 712, 713) (\\"Under the common-law rule a person who does not believe in a God who is the rewarder of truth and the avenger of falsehood cannot be permitted to testify.\\") Atheists such as biologist and popular author Richard Dawkins have proposed that human morality is a result of evolutionary, sociobiological history. He proposes that the \\"moral zeitgeist\\" helps describe how moral imperatives and values naturalistically evolve over time from biological and cultural origins. Evolutionary biologist Kenneth R. Miller notes that such a conception of evolution and morality is a misunderstanding of sociobiology and at worst it is an attempt to abolish any meaningful system of morality since though evolution would have provided the biological drives and desires we have, it does not tell us what is good or right or wrong or moral. Critics assert that natural law provides a foundation on which people may build moral rules to guide their choices and regulate society, but does not provide as strong a basis for moral behavior as a morality that is based in religion.\\"Where morality is divorced from religion, reason will, it is true, enable a man to recognize to a large extent the ideal to which his nature points. But much will be wanting. He will disregard some of his most essential duties. He will, further, be destitute of the strong motives for obedience to the law afforded by the sense of obligation to God and the knowledge of the tremendous sanction attached to its neglect ‚Äì motives which experience has proved to be necessary as a safeguard against the influence of the passions. And, finally, his actions even if in accordance with the moral law, will be based not on the obligation imposed by the Divine will, but on considerations of human dignity and on the good of human society.\\" Douglas Wilson, an evangelical theologian, argues that while atheists can behave morally, belief is necessary for an individual \\"to give a rational and coherent account\\" of why they are obligated to lead a morally responsible life.Christopher Hitchens and Douglas Wilson, \\"Is Christianity Good for the World? Part 2\\" Christianity Today magazine (web only, May 2007) Wilson says that atheism is unable to \\"give an account of why one deed should be seen as good and another as evil\\".Christopher Hitchens and Douglas Wilson, \\"Is Christianity Good for the World? Part 6\\" Christianity Today magazine (web only, May 2007) Cardinal Cormac Murphy-O'Connor, outgoing Archbishop of Westminster, expressed this position by describing a lack of faith as \\"the greatest of evils\\" and blamed atheism for war and destruction, implying that it was a \\"greater evil even than sin itself\\". According to William Lane Craig, in a world without God people are living in a state where evil is completely unregulated and also permissible, while at the same time good and self- sacrificing people would live in an unrewarded state where noble deeds lose their virtue and are rendered valueless.  Atheism as faith  Another criticism of atheism is that it is a faith in itself as a belief in its own right, with a certainty about the falseness of religious beliefs that is comparable to the certainty about the unknown that is practiced by religions.David Limbaugh, \\"Does atheism require more faith?,\\" Townhall.com, April 20, 2004 * Stanley Fish, \\"Atheism and Evidence,\\" Think Again, The New York Times, June 17, 2007 *DHRUV K. SINGHAL, \\"The Church of Atheism,\\", The Harvard Crimson, December 14, 2008 * Norman L. Geisler and Frank Turek, I Don't Have Enough Faith to Be an Atheist,\\" Crossway Books, March 01, 2004, 447 Pages, * John F. Haught, God and the New Atheism: A Critical Response to Dawkins, Harris, and Hitchens, Westminster John Knox Press, December 31, 2007, 156 pages, , page 45 Activist atheists have been criticized for positions said to be similar to religious dogma. In his essay Dogmatic Atheism and Scientific Ignorance for the World Union of Deists, Peter Murphy wrote: \\"The dogmatic atheist like the dogmatic theist is obsessed with conformity and will spew a tirade of angry words against anyone who does not conform to their own particular world view\\". The Times arts and entertainment writer Ian Johns described the 2006 British documentary The Trouble with Atheism as \\"reiterating the point that the dogmatic intensity of atheists is the secular equivalent of the blinkered zeal of fanatical mullahs and biblical fundamentalists\\". * * Though the media often portrays atheists as \\"angry\\" and studies show that the general population and \\"believers\\" perceive atheists as \\"angry\\", Brian Meier et al. found that individual atheists are no more angry than individuals in other populations. In a study on American secularity, Frank Pasquale notes that some tensions do exist among secular groups where, for instance, atheists are sometimes viewed as \\"fundamentalists\\" by secular humanists.Pasquale, Frank. \\"Secularism & Secularity: Contemporary International Perspectives\\". Hartford, CT: Institute for the Study of Secularism in Society and Culture (ISSSC), 2007. p. 46. \\"Some self-identified Atheists consequently distinguish between \\"positive\\" and \\"negative\\" forms. There is general regard among members of these groups as nonreligious comrades-in-arms. There is shared concern about misrepresentation or misunderstanding of nonreligious people, erosion of church-state separation, public and political influence of conservative religion, and aspects of American domestic and international policy. But there are also notes of irreligious sectarianism. In a meeting of secular humanists, one audience member proclaims, \\"We have our fundamentalists, too. They‚Äôre called Atheists.\\" In an Atheist meeting across town, derisive asides make reference to \\"a lack of spine\\" or \\"going soft onreligion\\" among \\"the humanists.\\" These groups struggle for public recognition and legitimacy. In his book First Principles (1862), the 19th-century English philosopher and sociologist Herbert Spencer wrote that as regards the origin of the universe, three hypotheses are possible: self-existence (atheism), self-creation (pantheism), or creation by an external agency (theism).Spencer, Herbert (1862). First Principles. London: Williams and Norgate, pp. 30-35. Spencer argued that it is \\"impossible to avoid making the assumption of self-existence\\" in any of the three hypothesesSpencer, First Principles, p. 36. and concluded that \\"even positive Atheism comes within the definition\\" of religion.Spencer, First Principles, p. 43. In an anthropological study on modernity, Talal Asad quotes an Arab atheist named Adonis who has said: \\"The sacred for atheism is the human being himself, the human being of reason, and there is nothing greater than this human being. It replaces revelation by reason and God with humanity\\". To which Asad points out: \\"But an atheism that deifies Man is, ironically, close to the doctrine of the incarnation\\". Michael Martin and Paul Edwards have responded to criticism-as-faith by emphasizing that atheism can be the rejection of belief, or absence of belief.Martin, Michael. The Cambridge Companion to Atheism. Cambridge University Press. 2006. . * * Don Hirschberg once famously that said \\"calling atheism a religion is like calling bald a hair color\\".  Catholic perspective  The Catechism of the Catholic Church identifies atheism as a violation of the First Commandment, calling it \\"a sin against the virtue of religion\\". The catechism is careful to acknowledge that atheism may be motivated by virtuous or moral considerations and admonishes Catholics to focus on their own role in encouraging atheism by their religious or moral shortcomings: :(2125) [...] The imputability of this offense can be significantly diminished in virtue of the intentions and the circumstances. \\"Believers can have more than a little to do with the rise of atheism. To the extent that they are careless about their instruction in the faith, or present its teaching falsely, or even fail in their religious, moral, or social life, they must be said to conceal rather than to reveal the true nature of God and of religion.Catechism of the Catholic Church, English version, section 3.2.1.1.3  Historical criticism  Edmund Burke wrote that atheism is against human reason and instinct. The Bible has criticized atheism by stating: \\"The fool has said in his heart, There is no God. They are corrupt, they have done abominable works, there is none that does good\\" (Psalm 14:1). In his essay On Atheism, Francis Bacon criticized the dispositions towards atheism as being \\"contrary to wisdom and moral gravity\\" and being associated with fearing government or public affairs. He also stated that knowing a little science may lead one to atheism, but knowing more science will lead one to religion. In another work called The Advancement of Learning, Bacon stated that superficial knowledge of philosophy inclines one to atheism while more knowledge of philosophy inclines one toward religion. In Reflections on the Revolution in France, Edmund Burke, an 18th-century Irish philosopher and statesman praised by both his conservative and liberal peers for his \\"comprehensive intellect\\", wrote that \\"man is by his constitution a religious animal; that atheism is against, not only our reason, but our instincts; and that it cannot prevail long\\". Burke wrote of a \\"literary cabal\\" who had \\"some years ago formed something like a regular plan for the destruction of the Christian religion. This object they pursued with a degree of zeal which hitherto had been discovered only in the propagators of some system of piety... These atheistical fathers have a bigotry of their own; and they have learnt to talk against monks with the spirit of a monk\\". In turn, wrote Burke, a spirit of atheistic fanaticism had emerged in France.  Atheism and politics  The historian Geoffrey Blainey wrote that during the 20th century atheists in Western societies became more active and even militant, expressing their arguments with clarity and skill. Like modern Christians, they reject the idea of an interventionist God and they argue that Christianity promotes war and violence. However, Blainey notes that anyone, not just Christians, can promote violence, writing \\"that the most ruthless leaders in the Second World War were atheists and secularists who were intensely hostile to both Judaism and Christianity. Later massive atrocities were committed in the East by those ardent atheists, Pol Pot and Mao Zedong. All religions, all ideologies, all civilizations display embarrassing blots on their pages\\".Geoffrey Blainey; A Short History of Christianity; Viking; 2011; p.543 Philosophers Russell Blackford and Udo Sch√ºklenk have written: \\"By contrast to all of this, the Soviet Union was undeniably an atheist state, and the same applies to Maoist China and Pol Pot's fanatical Khmer Rouge regime in Cambodia in the 1970s. That does not, however, show that the atrocities committed by these totalitarian dictatorships were all the result of atheist beliefs, carried out in the name of atheism, or caused primarily by the atheistic aspects of the relevant forms of communism\\". However, they do admit that some forms of persecutions such as those done on churches and religious people were partially related to atheism, but insist it was mostly based on economics and political reasons.50 Great Myths About Atheism; Russell Blackford, Udo Sch√ºklenk; John Wiley & Sons, 2013; Pgs. 85-90; 141-144; Historian Jeffrey Burton Russell has argued that \\"atheist rulers such as Lenin, Hitler, Stalin, Mao Zedong and Pol Pot tortured, starved and murdered more people in the twentieth century than all the combined religious regimes of the world during the previous nineteen centuries\\". He also states: \\"The antitheist argument boils down to this: a Christian who does evil does so because he is a Christian; an atheist who does evil does so despite being an atheist. The absolute reverse could be argued, but either way it's nothing but spin. The obvious fact is that some Christians do evil in the name of Christianity and some atheists do evil in the name of atheism\\". William Husband, a historian of the Soviet secularization has noted: \\"But the cultivation of atheism in Soviet Russia also possessed distinct characteristic, none more important than the most obvious: atheism was an integral part of the world's first large-scale experiment in communism. The promotion of an antireligious society therefore constitutes an important development in Soviet Russia and in the social history of atheism globally\\". Daniel Piers, a historian of the League of the Militant Godless which was a \\"nominally independent organization established by the Communist Party to promote atheism\\" in the Soviet Union notes that its pro-atheism activities included active proselytizing of people's personal beliefs, sponsoring lectures, organizing demonstrations, printing and distribution of pamphlets and posters. Early twentieth century The Cathedral of Christ the Saviour in Moscow during its 1931 demolition as Marxist‚ÄíLeninist atheism and other adaptations of Marxian thought on religion have enjoyed the official patronage of various one-party Communist states In Julian Baggini's book Atheism A Very Short Introduction, the author notes: \\"One of the most serious charges laid against atheism is that it is responsible for some of the worst horrors of the 20th century, including the Nazi concentration camps and Stalin's gulags\\".Julian Baggini; Atheism a Very Short Introduction; Oxford University Press, 2003, pp. 85 However, the author concludes that Nazi Germany was not a \\"straightforwardly atheist state\\", but one which sacrilized notions of blood and nation in a way that is \\"foreign to mainstream rational atheism\\" and that while the Soviet Union, which was \\"avowedly and officially an atheist state\\", this is not a reason to think that atheism is necessarily evil, though it is a refutation of the idea that atheism must always be benign as \\"there is I believe a salutary lesson to be learned from the way in which atheism formed an essential part of Soviet Communism, even though Communism does not form an essential part of atheism. This lesson concerns what can happen when atheism becomes too militant and Enlightenment ideals too optimistic\\".Julian Baggini; Atheism a Very Short Introduction; Oxford University Press, 2003, pp. 85-87 From the outset, Christians were critical of the spread of militant Marxist‚ÄíLeninist atheism, which took hold in Russia following the 1917 Revolution and involved a systematic effort to eradicate religion.Richard Pipes; Russia under the Bolshevik Regime; The Harvill Press; 1994; pp. 339‚Äì340Alan Bullock; Hitler and Stalin: Parallel Lives; Fontana Press; 1993; pp.412Geoffrey Blainey; A Short History of Christianity; Viking; 2011Martin Amis; Koba the Dread; Vintage; 2003 In the Soviet Union after the Revolution, teaching religion to the young was criminalized. Marxist‚ÄíLeninist atheism and other adaptations of Marxian thought on religion enjoyed the official patronage of various one-party Communist states since 1917. The Bolsheviks pursued \\"militant atheism\\".Martin Amis; Koba the Dread; Vintage; 2003; pp.184-185 The Soviet leaders Vladimir Lenin and Joseph Stalin energetically pursued the persecution of the Church through the 1920s and 1930s. It was made a criminal offence for priests to teach a child the faith. Many priests were killed and imprisoned. Thousands of churches were closed, some turned into temples of atheism. In 1925, the government founded the League of Militant Atheists to intensify the persecution.Geoffrey Blainey; A Short History of Christianity; Viking; 2011; p.494 Pope Pius XI reigned during the rise of the dictators in the 1930s and his 1937 encyclical Divini redemptoris denounced the \\"current trend to atheism which is alarmingly on the increase\\" Pope Pius XI reigned from 1922 to 1939 and responded to the rise of totalitarianism in Europe with alarm. He issued three papal encyclicals challenging the new creeds: against Italian Fascism, Non abbiamo bisogno (1931; 'We do not need to acquaint you); against Nazism, Mit brennender Sorge (1937; \\"With deep concern\\"); and against atheist Communism, Divini Redemptoris (1937; \\"Divine Redeemer\\").Encyclop√¶dia Britannica Online: Pius XI; web Apr. 2013 In Divini Redemptoris, Pius XI said that atheistic Communism being led by Moscow was aimed at \\"upsetting the social order and at undermining the very foundations of Christian civilization\\":Divini Redemptoris - Encyclical of Pope Pius XI on Atheistic Communism; by Pope Pius XI; 19 March 1937 A picture saying \\"Comrade Lenin Cleanses the Earth of Filth\\" as Vladimir Lenin was a significant figure in the spread of political atheism in the 20th century and the figure of a priest is among the enemies being swept away In Fascist Italy, led by the atheist Benito Mussolini, the Pope denounced the efforts of the state to supplant the role of the Church as chief educator of youth and denounced Fascism's \\"worship\\" of the state rather than the divine, but Church and state settled on mutual, shaky, toleration.Geoffrey Blainey; A Short History of Christianity; Viking; 2011; pp.495-6RJB Bosworth; Mussolini's Italy; Penguin; 2005; p. 263 Historian of the Nazi period Richard J.

By 1939, all Catholic denominational schools in the Third Reich had been disbanded or converted to public facilities.Evans, Richard J. 2005 pp. 245-246 In this climate, Pope Pius XI issued his anti-Nazi encyclical, Mit Brennender Sorge in 1937, saying:Mit Brennender Sorge: 29 Pope Pius XI; 14 March 1937 Pius XI died on the eve of World War II. Following the outbreak of war and the 1939 Nazi/Soviet joint invasion of Poland, the newly elected Pope Pius XII again denounced the eradication of religious education in his first encyclical, saying: \\"Perhaps the many who have not grasped the importance of the educational and pastoral mission of the Church will now understand better her warnings, scouted in the false security of the past. No defense of Christianity could be more effective than the present straits. From the immense vortex of error and anti-Christian movements there has come forth a crop of such poignant disasters as to constitute a condemnation surpassing in its conclusiveness any merely theoretical refutation\\".Summi Pontificatus, Encyclical of Pope Pius XII on the Unity of Human Society ; 20 October 1939 Post-war Christian leaders including Pope John Paul II continued the Christian critique.Geoffrey Blainey; A Short History of Christianity; Viking; 2011; p.540 In 2010, his successor, the German Pope Benedict XVI said: British biologist Richard Dawkins criticised Pope Benedict's remarks and described Hitler as a \\"Catholic\\" because he \\"never renounced his baptismal Catholicism\\" and said that \\"Hitler certainly was not an atheist. In 1933 he claimed to have 'stamped atheism out'\\". In contrast, historian Alan Bullock wrote that Hitler was a rationalist and a materialist with no feeling for the spiritual or emotional side of human existence: a \\"man who believed neither in God nor in conscience\\".Alan Bullock; Hitler: a Study in Tyranny; HarperPerennial Edition 1991; p216 Anton Gill has written that Hitler wanted Catholicism to have \\"nothing at all to do with German society\\".Gill, Anton (1994).

Retrieved September 16, 2010 However, opponents of this view cite examples such as the Bolsheviks (in Soviet Russia) who were inspired by \\"an ideological creed which professed that all religion would atrophy [...] resolved to eradicate Christianity as such\\".

Persecutions of religious leaders followed.Peter Hebblethwaite; Paul VI, the First Modern Pope; Harper Collins Religious; 1993; p.211Norman Davies; Rising '44: the Battle for Warsaw; Viking; 2003; p.566 & 568 The Soviet Union ended its truce against the Russian Orthodox Church and extended its persecutions to the newly Communist Eastern bloc. In Poland, Hungary, Lithuania and other Eastern European countries, Catholic leaders who were unwilling to be silent were denounced, publicly humiliated or imprisoned by the Communists. According to Geoffrey Blainey, leaders of the national Orthodox Churches in Romania and Bulgaria had to be \\"cautious and submissive\\". Albania under Enver Hoxha became in 1967 the first (and to date only) formally declared atheist state, going far beyond what most other countries had attempted‚Äîcompletely prohibiting religious observance and systematically repressing and persecuting adherents. The right to religious practice was restored in the fall of communism in 1991. In 1967, Hoxha's regime conducted a campaign to extinguish religious life in Albania and by year's end over two thousand religious buildings were closed or converted to other uses and religious leaders were imprisoned and executed. Albania was declared to be the world's first atheist country by its leaders and Article 37 of the Albanian constitution of 1976 stated: \\"The State recognises no religion, and supports and carries out atheistic propaganda in order to implant a scientific materialistic world outlook in people\\".David Binder, \\"Evolution in Europe; Albanian Leader Says the Country Will Be Democratized but Will Retain Socialism,\\" The New York Times, May 14, 1990 Mao Zedong with Joseph Stalin in 1949 as both leaders repressed religion and established state atheism throughout their respective Communist spheres Nicolae Ceau≈üescu, here with Pol Pot in 1978, launched a persecution of religion in Romania to implement the doctrine of Marxist‚ÄìLeninist atheism, while Pol Pot banned religious practices in Cambodia In 1949, China became a Communist state under the leadership of Mao Zedong's Communist Party of China. China itself had been a cradle of religious thought since ancient times, being the birthplace of Confucianism and Daoism. Under Communism, China became officially atheist, and though some religious practices were permitted to continue under state supervision, religious groups deemed a threat to order have been suppressed‚Äîas with Tibetan Buddhism since 1959 and Falun Gong in recent years.Encyclop√¶dia Britannica Online - China: Religion; accessed 10 November 2013 During the Cultural Revolution, Mao instigated \\"struggles\\" against the Four Olds: \\"old ideas, customs, culture, and habits of mind\\".Encyclop√¶dia Britannica Online - China - History: Cultural Revolution; accessed 10 November 2013 In Buddhist Cambodia, influenced by Mao's Cultural Revolution, Pol Pot's Khmer Rouge also instigated a purge of religion during the Cambodian genocide, when all religious practices were forbidden and Buddhist monasteries were closed.Encyclop√¶dia Britannica Online - Cambodia History; accessed 10 November 2013Encyclop√¶dia Britannica Online - Cambodia: Religion; accessed 10 November 2013 Evangelical Christian writer Dinesh D'Souza writes: \\"The crimes of atheism have generally been perpetrated through a hubristic ideology that sees man, not God, as the creator of values.

On other occasions, Dawkins has replied to the argument that Hitler and Stalin were antireligious with the response that Hitler and Stalin also grew moustaches in an effort to show the argument as fallacious.The Video: Bill O'Reilly Interviews Richard Dawkins Instead, Dawkins argues in The God Delusion: \\"What matters is not whether Hitler and Stalin were atheists, but whether atheism systematically influences people to do bad things.

Historian Borden Painter assessed Dawkins' claims on Stalin, atheism and violence in light of mainstream historical scholarship, stating that Dawkins did not use reliable sources to reach his conclusions. He argues: \\"He omits what any textbook would tell him: Marxism included atheism as a piece of its secular ideology that claimed a basis in scientific thinking originating in the Enlightenment\\". D'Souza responds to Dawkins that an individual need not explicitly invoke atheism in committing atrocities if it is already implied in his worldview as is the case in Marxism. In a 1993 address to American bishops, Pope John Paul II spoke of a spreading \\"practical atheism\\" in modern societies which was clouding the moral sense of humans and fragmenting society: Journalist Robert Wright has argued that some New Atheists discourage looking for deeper root causes of conflicts when they assume that religion is the sole root of the problem. Wright argues that this can discourage people from working to change the circumstances that actually give rise to those conflicts. Mark Chaves has said that the New Atheists, amongst others who comment on religions, have committed the religious congruence fallacy in their writings by assuming that beliefs and practices remain static and coherent through time. He believes that the late Christopher Hitchens committed this error by assuming that the drive for congruence is a defining feature of religion and that Daniel Dennett has done it by overlooking the fact that religious actions are dependent on the situation, just like other actions.  Atheism and science  Early modern atheism developed in the 17th century and Winfried Schroeder, a historian of atheism, has noted that science during this time did not strengthen the case for atheism.Schroeder, Winfried. Ursprunge des Atheismus: Untersuchungen zur Metaphysik- und Religionskritik des 17. und 18. Jahrhunderts. Tubingen: Frommann- Holzboog, 1998. Pg 79-80, 291, 297-302 In the 18th century, Denis Diderot argued that atheism was less scientific than metaphysics. Prior to Charles Darwin, the findings of biology did not play a major part in the atheist's arguments since in the earliest avowedly atheist texts atheists were embarrassed to an appeal to chance against the available arguments for design. As Schroeder has noted, throughout the 17th and 18th centuries theists excelled atheists in their ability to make contributions to the serious study of biological processes. In the time of the Enlightenment, mechanical philosophy was developed by Christians such as Isaac Newton, Ren√© Descartes, Robert Boyle and Pierre Gassendi who saw a self- sustained and autonomous universe as an intrinsically Christian belief. The mechanical world was seen as providing strong evidence against atheism since nature had evidence of order and providence, instead of chaos and spontaneity. However, since the 19th century both atheists and theists have said that science supports their worldviews. Historian of science John Henry has noted that before the 19th century science was generally cited to support many theological positions. However, materialist theories in natural philosophy became more prominent from the 17th century onwards, giving more room for atheism to develop. Since the 19th century, science has been employed in both theistic and atheistic cultures, depending on the prevailing popular beliefs. In reviewing the rise of modern science, Taner Edis notes that science does work without atheism and that atheism largely remains a position that is adopted for philosophical or ethical, rather than scientific reasons. The history of atheism is heavily invested in the philosophy of religion and this has resulted in atheism being weakly tied to other branches of philosophy and almost completely disconnected from science which means that it risks becoming stagnant and completely irrelevant to science. Sociologist Steve Fuller wrote: \\"Atheism as a positive doctrine has done precious little for science\\". He notes: \\"More generally, Atheism has not figured as a force in the history of science not because it has been suppressed but because whenever it has been expressed, it has not specifically encouraged the pursuit of science\\". Massimo Pigliucci noted that the Soviet Union had adopted an atheist ideology called Lysenkoism, which rejected Mendelian genetics and Darwinian evolution as capitalist propaganda, which was in sync with Stalin's dialectic materialism and ultimately impeded biological and agricultural research for many years, including the exiling and deaths of many valuable scientists. This part of history has symmetries with other ideologically driven ideas such as intelligent design, though in both cases religion and atheism are not the main cause, but blind commitments to worldviews. Lysenkoism reigned over Soviet science since the 1920s to the early 1960s where genetics was proclaimed a pseudoscience for more than 30 years despite significant advances in genetics in earlier years. It relied on Lamarckian views and rejected concepts such as genes and chromosomes and proponents claimed to have discovered that rye could transform into wheat and wheat into barley and that natural cooperation was observed in nature as opposed to natural selection. Ultimately, Lysenkoism failed to deliver on its promises in agricultural yields and had unfortunate consequences such as the arresting, firing, or execution of 3,000 biologists due to attempts from Lysenko to suppress opposition to his theory. According to historian Geoffrey Blainey, in recent centuries literalist biblical accounts of creation were undermined by scientific discoveries in geology and biology, leading various thinkers to question the idea that God created the universe at all.Geoffrey Blainey; A Short History of Christianity; Viking; 2011; pp.438-439 However, he also notes: \\"Other scholars replied that the universe was so astonishing, so systematic, and so varied that it must have a divine maker. Criticisms of the accuracy of the Book of Genesis were therefore illuminating, but minor\\". Some philosophers, such as Alvin Plantinga, have argued the universe was fine-tuned for life.Is Atheism Irrational?; New York Times; 9 Feb 2014 Atheists have sometimes responded by referring to the anthropic principle. British mathematician and philosopher of science John Lennox Physicist Karl W. Giberson and philosopher of science Mariano Artigas reviewed the views of some notable atheist scientists such as Carl Sagan, Richard Dawkins, Stephen Jay Gould, Stephen Hawking, Steven Weinberg and E. O. Wilson which have engaged popular writing which include commentary on what science is, society and religion for the lay public. Giberson and Artigas note that though such authors provide insights from their fields, they often misinform the public by engaging in non-scientific commentary on society, religion and meaning under the guise of non-existent scientific authority and no scientific evidence. Some impressions these six authors make that are erroneous and false include: science is mainly about origins and that most scientists work in some aspect of either cosmic or biological evolution, scientists are either agnostic or atheistic and science is incompatible and even hostile to religion. To these impressions, Giberson and Artigas note that the overwhelming majority of science articles in any journal in any field have nothing to do with origins because most research is funded by taxpayers or private corporations so ultimately practical research that benefit people, the environment, health and technology are the core focus of science; significant portions of scientists are religious and spiritual; and the majority of scientists are not hostile to religion since no scientific organization has any stance that is critical to religion, the scientific community is diverse in terms of worldviews and there is no collective opinion on religion. Primatologist Frans de Waal has criticized atheists for often presenting science and religion to audiences in a simplistic and false view of conflict, thereby propagating a myth that has been dispelled by history. He notes that there are dogmatic parallels between atheists and some religious people in terms of how they argue about many issues. Evolutionary biologist Kenneth R. Miller has argued that when scientists make claims on science and theism or atheism, they are not arguing scientifically at all and are stepping beyond the scope of science into discourses of meaning and purpose. What he finds particularly odd and unjustified is in how atheists often come to invoke scientific authority on their non-scientific philosophical conclusions like there being no point or no meaning to the universe as the only viable option when the scientific method and science never have had any way of addressing questions of meaning or lack of meaning, or the existence or non-existence of God in the first place. Atheists do the same thing theists do on issues not pertaining to science like questions on God and meaning. Theologian scientist Alister McGrath points out that atheists have misused biology in terms of both evolution as \\"Darwinism\\" and Darwin himself, in their \\"atheist apologetics\\" in order to propagate and defend their worldviews. He notes that in atheist writings there is often an implicit appeal to an outdated \\"conflict\\" model of science and religion which has been discredited by historical scholarship, there is a tendency to go beyond science to make non-scientific claims like lack of purpose and characterizing Darwin as if he was an atheist and his ideas as promoting atheism. McGrath notes that Darwin never called himself an atheist nor did he and other early advocates of evolution see his ideas as propagating atheism and that numerous contributors to evolutionary biology were Christians. Oxford Professor of Mathematics John Lennox has written that the issues one hears about science and religion have nothing to do with science, but are merely about theism and atheism because top level scientists abound on both sides. Furthermore, he criticizes atheists who argue from scientism because sometimes it results in dismissals of things like philosophy based on ignorance of what philosophy entails and the limits of science. He also notes that atheist scientists in trying to avoid the visible evidence for God ascribe creative power to less credible candidates like mass and energy, the laws of nature and theories of those laws. Lennox notes that theories that Hawking appeals to such as the multiverse are speculative and untestable and thus do not amount to science. American physician geneticist Francis Collins Physicist Paul Davies of Arizona State University has written that the very notion of physical law is a theological one in the first place: \\"Isaac Newton first got the idea of absolute, universal, perfect, immutable laws from the Christian doctrine that God created the world and ordered it in a rational way\\".Taking Science on Faith; Paul Davies, The New York Times, 24 Nov 2007 John Lennox has argued that science itself sits more comfortably with theism than with atheism and \\"as a scientist I would say... where did modern science come from? It didn't come from atheism... modern science arose in the 16th and 17th centuries in Western Europe, and of course people ask why did it happen there and then, and the general consensus which is often called Merton's Thesis is, to quote CS Lewis who formulated it better than anybody I know... 'Men became scientific. Why? Because they expected law in nature, and they expected law in nature because they believed in a lawgiver.' In other words, it was belief in God that was the motor that drove modern science\\".An Evening with John Lennox; ABC Radio National - The Spirit of Things; 7 August 2011 Francis Collins, the American physician and geneticist who lead the Human Genome Project, argues that theism is more rational than atheism. Collins also found Lewis persuasive and after reading Mere Christianity came to believe that a rational person would be more likely to believe in a god. Collins argues: \\"How is it that we, and all other members of our species, unique in the animal kingdom, know what's right and what's wrong... I reject the idea that that is an evolutionary consequence, because that moral law sometimes tells us that the right thing to do is very self-destructive. If I'm walking down the riverbank, and a man is drowning, even if I don't know how to swim very well, I feel this urge that the right thing to do is to try to save that person. Evolution would tell me exactly the opposite: preserve your DNA. Who cares about the guy who's drowning? He's one of the weaker ones, let him go. It's your DNA that needs to survive. And yet that's not what's written within me\\".The Question of God - an interview with Francis Collins; PBS; 2004 Dawkins addresses this criticism by showing that the evolutionary process can account for the development of altruistic traits in organisms. However, molecular biologist Kenneth R. Miller argues that Dawkin's conception of evolution and morality is a misunderstanding of sociobiology since though evolution would have provided the biological drives and desires we have, it does not tell us what is good or right or wrong or moral.  New Atheism In the early 21st century, a group of authors and media personalities in Britain and the United States‚Äîoften referred to as the \\"New Atheists\\"‚Äîhave argued that religion must be proactively countered, criticized so as to reduce its influence on society. Prominent among these voices have been Christopher Hitchens, Richard Dawkins, Daniel Dennett and Sam Harris. Among those to critique their world view has been American-Iranian religious studies scholar Reza Aslan. Aslan argued that the New Atheists held an often comically simplistic view of religion which was giving atheism a bad name:Reza Aslan on What the New Atheists Get Wrong About Islam; New York Magazine; 14 October 2014 Professor of anthropology and sociology Jack David Eller believes that the four principal New Atheist authors‚ÄîHitchens, Dawkins, Dennett and Harris‚Äîwere not offering anything new in terms of arguments to disprove the existence of gods. He also criticized them for their focus on the dangers of theism as opposed to the falsifying of theism, which results in mischaracterizing religions, taking local theisms as the essence of religion itself and for focusing on the negative aspects of religion in the form of an \\"argument from benefit\\" in the reverse. Professors of philosophy and religion Jeffrey Robbins and Christopher Rodkey take issue with \\"the evangelical nature of the new atheism, which assumes that it has a Good News to share, at all cost, for the ultimate future of humanity by the conversion of as many people as possible\\". They find similarities between the new atheism and evangelical Christianity and conclude that the all-consuming nature of both \\"encourages endless conflict without progress\\" between both extremities. Sociologist William Stahl notes: \\"What is striking about the current debate is the frequency with which the New Atheists are portrayed as mirror images of religious fundamentalists\\". He discusses where both have \\"structural and epistemological parallels\\" and argues that \\"both the New Atheism and fundamentalism are attempts to recreate authority in the face of crises of meaning in late modernity\\". The English philosopher Roger Scruton has said that saying that religion is damaging to mankind is just as ridiculous as saying that love is damaging to mankind. Like love, religion leads to conflict, cruelty, abuse and even wars, yet it also brings people joy, solitude, hope and redemption. He therefore states that New Atheists cherry-pick, ignoring the most crucial arguments in the favour of religion, whilst also reiterating the few arguments against religion. He has also stated that religion is an irrefutable part of the human condition, and that denying this is futile.

It is mentioned in A Grammar and Dictionary of the Malay language, With a Preliminary Dissertation, Volume 2, By John Crawfurd, published in 1852. History It is traditionally made by mixing anchovies and salt in a ratio ranging from 2:1 to 6:1 and allowing the mix to ferment for 140 to 200 days. It is used as a flavouring and is normally eaten with fish, rice, and raw vegetables. It is similar to the in Philippines, in Indonesia, in Burma, in Vietnam, or in Japan, colombo-cure in Indian subcontinent, in China, and in Korea. The fish product is the result of hydrolysis of fish and microbial proteases. The flavor and aroma of Budu are produced by the action of proteolytic microorganisms surviving during the fermentation process. Palm sugar and tamarind are usually added to promote a browning reaction, resulting in a dark brown hue. The ratio of fish to salt is key to the final desired product. Different concentrations of salt influences the microbial and enzymatic activity, resulting in different flavours. The microorganisms found during Budu production are generally classified as halophilic.Various Component and Bacteria of Budu Produced in Malaysia The microorganisms play important roles in protein degradation and flavour and aroma development. Budu is a traditional condiment among the ethnic Malays of east coast of Peninsular Malaysia, particularly in the state of Kelantan and Terengganu. Budu has been declared a Malaysian heritage food by the Malaysian Department of National Heritage. Even ethnic Chinese in Kelantan are involved in Budu production.The Unique Cina Kampung, The Star online Anchovy and its products like budu are high in protein and uric acid, thus not recommended for people with gout. The uric acid content in anchovies, however, is lower than that in tuna. Budu made from anchovy sauce has shown potential as an anti-cancer agent. Budu also as a food sourced from fish have potential as brain food. A new form of budu in powder form has been developed by a Politeknik Kota Bharu (PKB) student. This allows for easier storage and transport as it is lighter and less prone to bottle breakage.

He was a subject of ongoing federal investigations into organized crime in the city and was suspected of being an organized crime boss. Early life Born to immigrant parents from southern Italy, Colacurcio was the eldest of nine children, and worked on his father's vegetable farm in Seattle. He dropped out of school before completing the eighth grade and started a produce-hauling business. Colacurcio later worked as a butcher, farm hand, truck driver, and pulp mill worker. By age 18, he had opened his first trucking company. In 1943, Colacurcio was convicted for having sex with an underage girl. He served more than a year at the Monroe State Reformatory (now known as the Washington State Reformatory).  Career  In the 1950s, Colacurcio entered the jukebox, cigarette, and vending machine businesses. Business rivals claimed that he used threats to control the trade. With money earned from these businesses, Colacurcio started investing in bars, restaurants, and clubs. To avoid trouble obtaining liquor licenses, Colacurcio had relatives and associates front as the business owners. In 1957, he was subpoenaed to testify before the U.S. Senate Rackets Committee. Although Colacurcio never testified, Committee Counsel Robert F. Kennedy did question him about his alleged racketeering activities in Seattle. In the 1960s, Colacurcio acquired more interests in restaurants and nightclubs. In 1962, he opened a beer garden at the Seattle World's Fair. In 2003, law enforcement launched a criminal investigation in the Seattle area known as \\"Strippergate.\\" The investigation focused on Frank Sr, Frank Jr., and former Washington Governor Albert Rosellini for bribing members of the Seattle City Council. In 2005, both Frank Sr. and Frank Jr. were indicted, but in February 2006 the judge dismissed the charges. Rosellini was not charged in the investigation. In March 2006, the FBI started a multi-agency task force to investigate alleged organized crime, racketeering, and cold case murders tied to Frank Sr. In April 2006, the state supreme court reinstated money laundering and political corruption charges from Strippergate charges against Frank Sr. and Frank Jr. On June 2, 2008, local police and federal agents raided Frank Sr.'s home in Lake Forest Park, the Talents West offices, and multiple strip clubs in three counties. On June 30, 2009, Frank Sr., Frank Jr., and four associates were indicted by a federal grand jury on racketeering and other charges stemming from years-long investigations into allegations of prostitution and money laundering. Junior, 48, pleaded guilty to a racketeering-conspiracy charge in June 2010. In exchange, federal prosecutors agreed to dismiss fourteen other charges. He was sentenced in September to a year in jail and fined $1.3 million. Death In declining health, Colacurcio died at the age of 93 of heart failure, on July 2, 2010, at the University of Washington Medical Center in Seattle; he was buried at Acacia Memorial Park in Lake Forest Park.

For example, the early part of Vedas with mantras and prayers called Samhitas along with the commentary on rituals called the Brahmanas together are identified as the ceremonial ', while rituals and metaphoric-rituals part called Aranyakas and knowledge/spirituality part Upanishads are referred to as the '.Stephen Knapp (2005), The Heart of Hinduism: The Eastern Path to Freedom, Empowerment and Illumination, , pages 10-11 Etymology The root of the Sanskrit word Upasana is up and asana (from as), which means \\"to sit close to someone, waiting on someone with reverence\\".Klaus Witz (1998), The Supreme Wisdom of the Upani·π£ads: An Introduction, Motilal Banarsidass, , pages 196-197 Oldenberg explained Upasana from its root UpƒÅs-, in German as Verehren, or \\"to worship, adore, revere\\", with the clarification that in Vedic texts this adoration and reverence is at formless things, such as Absolute Self, the Holy, the Atman (Soul) Principle.H Oldenberg (1919), Vorwissenschaftliche Wissenschaft, die Weltanschauung der Brahmana-Texte, G√∂ttingen, pages 4-6 These texts offer the concept of Upasana to distinguish meditative reverence for an internalized and intellectual concept from earlier forms of physical worship, actual sacrifices and offerings to Vedic deities.Klaus Witz (1998), The Supreme Wisdom of the Upani·π£ads: An Introduction, Motilal Banarsidass, , page 197M Hara (1980), Hindu Concepts of Teacher Sanskrit Guru and ƒÄcƒÅrya, In Sanskrit and Indian Studies, Springer, , pages 93-11 Schayer offered a different perspective, stating Upasana in Vedic context is more closer to the German word Umwerben or Bedr√§ngen, or courting and pressing on metaphysical Soul, the Absolute Self (the Brahman) with hopes and petitions.Stanlisaw Schayer (1927), Uber die Bedeutung des Wortest Upanisad, Rocznik Orienalistyczny III, pages 57-67 Schayer further states that Upasana was a psychological act as well as a procedure, which etymologically was further developed by Renou. The concept of Upasana developed a large tradition in Vedanta era. It flowered into the meaning of an intense kind of systematic meditation. Adi Shankara described Upasana as that meditation \\"about someone or something, consisting of continuous succession of comparable basic concepts, without interspersing it with dissimilar concepts, that proceeds according to the scriptures and on idea enjoined in the scriptures\\".Klaus Witz (1998), The Supreme Wisdom of the Upani·π£ads: An Introduction, Motilal Banarsidass, , page 198-199 It is a state of concentration where \\"whatever is meditated upon\\" is completely identified, absorbed with self, and unified with as one identifies self consciousness with one's body. The two become one, \\"you are that\\". The \\"someone or something\\" in Upasana can be a symbolic deity or an abstract concept, states Shankara. In case of deity, Upasana is being one with god, which manifests as \\"be a god\\", and by \\"being a god, he attains the god.\\" Discussion In one contemporary context, Upasana means methods of worship (Bhakti), usually of meditative kind. Werner translates it as \\"meditation\\", while Murty translates it as \\" steadfastness of mind in the thing meditated upon\\".Karel (1995), Love Divine: Studies in 'Bhakti and Devotional Mysticism, Routledge, , page 125KS Murty (1993), Vedic Hermeneutics, Motilal Banarsidass, , page xxiv Upasana is also sometimes referred to as Puja.Alexander P. Varghese (2008), India: History, Religion, Vision and Contribution to the World, Volume 1, , pages 281-282 However, a formal Puja is just one type of worship in Indian philosophy. Paul Deussen translates upasana as \\"meditation\\" and \\"worship\\", depending on the context.Paul Deussen, , pages 5, 9, 42 In other contexts, Upasana refers to a part of the Vedic era texts relating to worship or meditation. The first parts of Vedas, composed the earliest, relate to sacrificial rituals. The second parts are Upasana-kanda, and the last parts relate to abstract philosophy and spirituality which are popularly called the Upanishads. In some cases, the Upasana chapters are embedded inside the Aranyakas. For example, in Rig Veda, first five of its books are called Aitareya Aranyaka. The 2nd and 3rd books are theosophical, and the first three sections of the 2nd book is called Prana Upasana (literally meaning, \\"worship of the vital energy\\"). The last three sections of the 2nd book constitutes the Aitareya Upanishad. The 3rd book of Rig Veda refers to Samhita Upasana (literally meaning, \\"unified form of worship\\"). Rig Veda has many books, and it includes many more Upasanas and Upanishads. Other Vedas follow a similar structure where they offer sections on rituals and action (Aranyakas), worship and deity oriented bhakti (Upasanas), as well as philosophical and abstract spirituality sections (Upanishads). Edward Crangle, in his review, states that Upasana in Vedic text initially developed as a form of \\"substitute sacrifice\\", where symbolic meditation of the Aranyakas practice, instead of actual sacrifice ritual, offered a means to gain the same merit without the sacrifice. Over time, this idea shifted from meditating about the ritual, to internalization and meditation of the ideas and concepts associated. This may have marked a key evolution in Vedic era, one from ritual sacrifices to one contemplating spiritual ideas.Edward F Crangle (1994), The Origin and Development of Early Indian Contemplative Practices, Otto Harrassowitz Verlag, , pages 59-63 In the Vedas, some Upasanas are prescribed method of worship for pleasing and winning the attention of the deity or it can be a deity-less practice of austerities involving meditating upon some aspect of nature as told in specific Vedic Upasanas. Puranas are another source for upasana procedures.

The club is based in Concord in the Inner West of Sydney, and plays home matches at Concord Oval. Concord holds a place in rugby history as a venue for the inaugural Rugby World Cup in 1987. West Harbour's major sponsor is Burwood RSL and post match functions are held at Club Burwood. In 2020, the Pirates would play out of Drummoyne Oval as Concord Oval being NRL club Wests Tigers' training ground, the venue was deemed off limited for people in excess of the \\"bubble\\".  Club information  :Uniform colours: Black, White and Red :Premiership Titles: 2 titles: 1902, 1929  Club history  Beginnings West Harbour R.F.C. was founded in 1900 as Western Suburbs D.R.U.F.C after an amalgamation between Burwood and Concord rugby clubs. The club originally fielded only two grade teams but still won the Sydney Premiership at its third attempt in 1902. Since then the club has won one other championship in 1929. The Club‚Äôs name was changed to Western Suburbs to satisfy municipal aldermen when it sought a lease on St Lukes Oval, later Concord Oval. Western Suburbs‚Äô boundaries were far-reaching in its early days because the club could draw on players from Concord to the Harbour, south to Port Hacking, north to the Parramatta River, and west to the Blue Mountains. When Parramatta, St George, Drummoyne, Gordon and Eastwood joined the competition these boundaries were reduced. Between the Wars Western Suburbs enjoyed a golden era after the war when Secretary Francis Joseph Herlihy co-opted Tom.S.R (Iron Guts) Davis, Larry Wogan, and Charlie Rea to help lift the club‚Äôs fortunes. They built a playing strength that enabled Western Suburbs to figure prominently in the competition for years and to win the competition in 1929 The brothers Geoff (1929) and Keith Storey (1936) entered international football from Western Suburbs followed by Sid King (1929), M.R.Blair (1931), T.S.Lawton (1929), A.Thorpe (1929), P.K.Collins (1937), R.L.F.Kelly (1936), R.E.M.McLaughlin (1936), T.P.Pauling (1936), and Cecil Ramalli (1938). Phil Hardcastle was an established Test player when he joined the club from Easts in 1948. Relegation and Promotion Western Suburbs were unceremoniously relegated to the second division in 1952 and fared poorly until promoted back into 1st Division in 1966. It was at this point that the club‚Äôs fortunes changed when Rufus Miahere joined as 1st Grade coach in 1970. Miahere began with seven wins in 1971 and eight wins in 1972. In 1973 he lifted the Club back to the glory it had enjoyed in the 1930s by winning 17 matches in a row. Western Suburbs won the Club Championships that year and the season was flawed only by a loss to Randwick in the Grand Final. That year Laurie Monaghan became the Club‚Äôs first test player since World War II, followed shortly after by one of Sydney‚Äôs true Rugby characters, Mick Ellem. The Club was once again relegated to 2nd Division in 1980 and then promoted back to 1st Division in 1981. In 1982, the Club had discussions with the Sydney Rugby Union regarding the upgrade of Concord Oval. The Club made a donation of $250,000 to the NSWRU, which allowed the State Government to provide a further $1 million and saw Concord Oval transformed into a world class rugby venue, which in 1987 saw more than 25,000 people attend the World Cup semi-final match between Australia and France. Resurgence and Professionalism The 1980s and '90s saw a resurgence in the Club‚Äôs strength. Stephen James represented Australia in a number of Test series from 1986 and Fili Finau wore the green and gold on a French Tour in 1993. In 1995, the Club changed its name to the West Harbour Rugby Football Club to more truly reflect the Club‚Äôs location in the inner west of the harbour city. In 1997, Fili Finau once again represented Australia, this time against New Zealand in the Bledisloe Cup. Jason Madz and Fili Finau also featured prominently for the NSW Super 12 side during this period. Steve Devine represented NSW and Australia U/21s and played with the Waratahs before signing a Super 12 contract with the Auckland Blues. Steve was then selected as a member of the All Blacks eventually playing 13 tests for New Zealand. Pierre Hola capped off a fine 2001 season by being selected in the Tongan national team and was a member of the Tongan 2003 World Cup Squad. In 2000/01 Des Tuiavii played for the ACT Brumbies before taking up a NSW Waratahs contract for the 2002/03 seasons. Des won both the Sydney Morning Herald‚Äôs Player of the Year and the NSWRU Ken Catchpole Medal in 2001 and played his 100th 1st Grade game for West Harbour in 2003. Des finished a remarkable 2003 season by playing for the Samoan side in the 2003 World Cup. In the early to mid 2000s, West Harbour had a number of players in the NSW Waratah and Junior Waratah squads including Lote Tuqiri, Timana Tahu, Chris O‚ÄôYoung and Elia Tiqiri all represented the Waratahs in 2004. Chris Siale and Rodney Blake represented the Australia U/21 side in the IRB Championships in Scotland. Both subsequently signed Super 12 contracts. Seven West Harbour players Penny Anderson, Louise Ferris, Charmain Smith, Debby Hodgkinson, Tui Ormsby, Nyree Osieck, Pearl Palaialii represented the Australian Wallaroos at the Women‚Äôs Rugby World Cup in Spain in 2002. Debby Hodgkinson was named the SMH ‚ÄúPlayer of the Year‚Äù for the 2004 season. The Current Era Since 2010, the Club‚Äôs fortunes have been mixed with periods of strong success and frustrating disappointments. With a seemingly transient playing population and a number of successive short term presidents and coaches, the Club has lacked a great deal of stability and has seen a high turnover of players. The tenure of experienced coach, Tod Louden, which came to an end at the culmination of the 2018 season saw another mass exodus of players. Yet the Club‚Äôs newly appointed board acted quickly to engage long time club man, Mark Gudmenson, as Head Coach, who in turn was successful season in bringing a sense of stability to the Club for the 2019 season driven by a competitive 1st Grade team. West Harbour is leaving Concord Oval in the 2020 season for two years as Canada Bay Council build a new state of the art stadium. The Club will be playing its home matches at Drummoyne Oval for the next two years, after which time West Harbour will return to Concord Oval, which will be the envy of the eleven Clubs in the Shute Shield. Representatives Overall 48 players who have played for the Club have gone on to represent the Wallabies, along with the large number of Wallabies and Wallaroos representative players. Due to the diverse nature of West Harbour Rugby Club, 36 players have gone on to represent other nations in international rugby including Samoa, Tonga, Fiji, Wales, Ireland, Scotland, New Zealand, the Philippines, Malta, Croatia and Lebanon. 89 players have been selected for representative honours with the New South Wales Waratahs and many others have played with other Super Rugby franchises.

Benefits  Laddering avoids the risk of reinvesting a large portion of assets in an unfavorable financial environment. Each \\"rung\\" of the ladder is a bond of a specific maturity date and the \\"height\\" of the ladder is the difference between the shortest maturity bond and the longest maturity bond. The more rungs in the ladder (10 or more is recommended), the better the diversification, the more stable the yield, and the higher the average yield. For example, a person has both a 2015 matured CD and a 2018 matured CD. Even if the interest rate is low in 2015 when one certificate is to be renewed, half of the income is locked in until 2018. Laddering can free up capital as needed. A person may purchase a shorter term bond in the event that he needs the capital soon to fund his children's tuition while purchasing other longer term bonds that mature later as retirement spending with a more favorable rate, assuming the economy is experiencing a normal yield curve during this time. Laddering can also be used as an overall retirement planning approach for all retirement investments. The idea is to separate CDs, cash, bonds, annuities, and others into different \\"ladders\\" (or \\"buckets\\" or \\"baskets\\") depending on when the asset is expected to be liquidated to fund the retirement revenue stream. Low-risk assets are used at the start of retirement (and usually have an expected lower rate of return, due to lacking a risk premium). Higher-risk assets would be placed in a basket used at the end of retirement. This strategy is useful for a diversified portfolio, with other assets in the stock market etc. Generally an initial investment of $10,000-$20,000 is required in order to purchase 5-10 bonds with different maturities for a specific timeline. IPO laddering Laddering also describes a process where, in order to purchase shares at a given price, investors must also agree to purchase additional shares at a higher price. This artificially inflates the price of the stock and allows insiders to buy at the lower price, with a guarantee that they will be able to sell at a higher price. This practice has resulted in investigations of national and global banks by the SEC after the stock market collapse.

High performance sailing is fast becoming the goal of a great many dinghy sailors with the appearance of 49ers as an Olympic class.The Flying Eleven is a logical step in the transition between junior classes such as the Manly Junior or Sabot and prepares young sailors for classes such as Cherubs, 420s, 470s, 29ers, Moths, 13s or even 49ers. History The F11 started in 1964. The main classes available for training young sailors were the VJ, MJ, Moth, Heron and it appeared there was an opening for a class with: :Comparable speed to the VJ :No hiking boards :More leg room :Main, jib and spinnaker :Light weight for transporting :A crew of two :Ease of building and :The possibility of dad getting his foot in occasionally The acceptance campaign then started and three different \\"models\\" of the Flying Eleven were taken to different clubs each weekend and sailed in all weathers. These three models were called the Open Sailer, the Self Drainer, and the Fully Decked Model. The fully decked model did not appeal to the go-fast boys and, although the self drainer was popular, the VJ self drainer was well established therefore the emphasis was put on a boat which, firstly, had to be expertly sailed to stay afloat and, secondly, would serve as a trainer for the open skiff classes ‚Äî so the open sailer it had to be. During the 1965‚Äì66 season Sans Souci Club accepted the F11 as a class, other clubs slowly followed and the NSW Fll Association was formed in 1967. After trying various types of additional buoyancy, such as side tanks, the lines were redrawn and a complete set of plans issued to the Association, covering hull, sails, centreboard and rudder. The early F11s were not as attractive or sophisticated as today - the clew of the genoa was 16\\" above the gunwale ‚Äî the mainsail hung from one full length top batten, with some short leech battens, all battens were made of cane, and the venturis, which were tube and box type with corks, would today be regarded as museum pieces. Since then, there have been many updates to the Flying 11 to ensure that it remains attractive to young sailors. For example, most Flying 11s are now made of fibreglass foam sandwich, rather than wood. The most recent of these updates is the allowance for carbon-fibre masts and carbon-fibre foils in the class specifications.

As a producer, he is noted for his work with Split Enz, and in Canada, for his mid-1980s work with Red Rider, Platinum Blonde and Gowan. He later produced Joe Cocker, The Divinyls \\"I Touch Myself\\", and the international hit for 4 Non Blondes \\"What's Up?\\". As an engineer or mixer, Tickle worked on best-selling albums by Blondie and U2. As a mixing engineer, he worked on several hit 1980s releases by Prince. Early career Tickle was born on 6 September 1959 in Guildford, Surrey, the only son of a university professor father and an artistic mother. By his own account,Biography on David Tickle website he was mixing Red Buddha concerts at the age of 16, and mixed three singles for pop-rock quartet Liverpool Express, which achieved modest success on British charts in 1976 and 1977. Through a friend he was introduced to New Zealand band Split Enz and laid down some tracks with them in a Manchester studio in early 1978. He was hired soon after by Terry Melcher for a job at Ringo Starr's Ringo Records, and appointed the in-house engineer for the label's newly-acquired recording facility, Startling Studios, at Tittenhurst Park, John Lennon's former house and studio near Ascot, Berkshire. Tickle helped convert the studio from 16- to 24-track and lived on-site, later telling one interviewer: \\"It was a great mansion, an 82-acre house, I was the only one to live there full time. I lived like a lord. Cooks, maids, the whole thing.\\" At Startling Studios, Tickle produced a further session with Split Enz, recording \\"I See Red\\", a punk-influenced single that became a hit in Australia and New Zealand. Although the band was keen to have Tickle produce their third album, Frenzy, they were overruled by their Australian management, who wanted a more experienced producer, and American Mallory Earl was drafted in. The band always regretted the decision, sensing Earl's work had failed to reach the levels of intensity and creativity their earlier sessions with Tickle had achieved. Mike Chapman In 1978, Tickle responded to an advertisement offering work for \\"the best engineer in England, money no object\\". The ad had been placed by noted producer Mike Chapman, whose run of hits in Britain was almost over and who was by now working in New York with Blondie on their breakthrough Parallel Lines album. Tickle was hired as a trainee producer and contributed mixing and engineering duties to Chapman's first US hits: Blondie's \\"Heart of Glass\\", The Knack's \\"My Sharona\\" and Exile's \\"Kiss You All Over\\". The experience provided Tickle with even more skills as a pop/rock producer. Split Enz In October 1979, Tickle reconvened with Split Enz, this time in Melbourne, Australia, to record what would become their breakthrough, multi-platinum album, True Colours, which included the single \\"I Got You\\". In the wake of their unsatisfying Frenzy album, the band was adamant their next record would be a Tickle production. As recording progressed and Tickle's strategy became clearer ‚Äì creating more space in their sound over resolute drum tracks ‚Äì the band became convinced the album would be a turning point. In his history of the band, Mike Chunn says: By mid-1980, Tickle was back in Melbourne to record a follow-up to True Colours. The band, however, were dismayed to find their wonder kid had undergone a dramatic change. Chunn explains: According to the radio documentary Enzology,Radio New Zealand Enzology radio documentary Tickle particularly clashed heads with Tim Finn. In an interview for the program, Tickle said that in the wake of \\"I Got You\\"'s success, Tim sought greater involvement in the engineering process. Early to mid-1980s Tickle never worked with Split Enz again, though he did produce the Practical Jokers album for The Swingers, the band formed by Split Enz co-founder Phil Judd. (Judd, however, was not a member of Split Enz while Tickle was their producer.) The Swingers' album included the major Australian/New Zealand hit single \\"Counting The Beat\\". In 1981, Tickle was hired by the Stiff label to remix the single \\"Is Vic There?\\" by London new wave cult band Department S. He produced a fatter, slicker pop sound. Later in the 1980s, Tickle produced hit singles and albums for several Canadian acts. Production credits during this era include Canadian and US chart hits by Red Rider (including \\"Human Race\\"), the first album by Platinum Blonde, which featured the Canadian hit singles \\"Doesn't Really Matter\\" and \\"Not In Love\\", and two albums by Gowan, which featured his Canadian top-10 hits \\"A Criminal Mind\\" and \\"Moonlight Desires\\" and \\"Strange Animal\\". During that same era, Tickle began a long-running working relationship with Prince, for whom he would work as engineer and mixing engineer, co-producing portions of six albums, and as live sound engineer on Prince's \\"Purple Rain\\" tour. * We'd start with the drum machine and I wouldn't leave the studio until it was mixed. That could be 24, 48 hours, and on a couple of occasions we got into about 72, 76 hours. - David Tickle Tickle was also involved in the recording of the new material. He worked front-of-house sound for the Purple Rain tour and mixed some of the singles taken from the soundtrack. As with Susan Rogers, that was the first time he had been involved in a Prince album from its inception. ‚ÄúThere was no clear objective with what the next album was going to be,‚Äù says Tickle. ‚ÄúIt wasn‚Äôt like it started out and it was gonna be this specific focus. Prince would literally write a song a day and every three days or so we would go and do a full production on something. If you listen to the album, there‚Äôs actually quite a difference in the context of the songs themselves, and even in production and sonic value. That‚Äôs because when you worked with Prince what happened was he would say, ‚ÄòDavid. I‚Äôve got a song. Get a studio‚Äô - maybe after a show one night, or we may have a couple of days off. We'd start with the drum machine and I wouldn't leave the studio until it was mixed. Right from the first bass drum being printed. That could be 24, 48 hours, and on a couple of occasions we got into about 72, 76 hours. Without going to sleep. That was his thing. You go in, you start it, and you don't leave until it's done. And that moment in time is encapsulated.‚Äù ‚ÄúSome of it is raggedy,‚Äù says Tickle. ‚ÄúIt doesn‚Äôt sound like it was done super high end in a studio, particularly at that time, when a lot of stuff was very pristinely recorded. That‚Äôs why everything is so unique. We‚Äôd go in, do a song and once it was done, we‚Äôd leave it.‚Äù ‚ÄúThey had more input,‚Äù agrees David Tickle. ‚ÄúPrince would put down a drum machine, do some kind of guide vocal, because he may not have figured out all of his vocal moves yet, then say to Wendy and Lisa, ‚ÄòHey, you go and put background vocals on this‚Äô and we'd build the thing up for him.‚Äù Relationship with Crowded House Despite the problems with Split Enz, Neil Finn made tentative plans to use Tickle again, this time as an engineer, on the first Crowded House album, which began recording in 1985. Ultimately, the album was produced by Mitchell Froom at a studio selected by Tickle, with Tickle receiving a higher payment than Froom in recognition of his experience. No fewer than five engineers were used on the album, but Tickle himself was not one of them. He did not engineer any of the finished album, and his name does not appear in the album credits or the extensive \\"thanks to\\" section. Later work Tickle continued to work as a producer during the late 1980s and 1990s, with credits on albums by Joan Armatrading, Belinda Carlisle, Toni Childs, and Joe Cocker among others. His biggest international successes were as producer of the Divinyls' hit 1991 single \\"I Touch Myself\\", and as the sole producer of 4 Non Blondes' only hit, 1993's \\"What's Up?\\". He also engineered all the studio tracks at A&M; Studios, Los Angeles, of the best-selling U2 album Rattle and Hum (1988), and mixed The Police's archival 1995 album Live!. David is married to well known Model Actress and Bass Player Kate Elizabeth Tickle and they have two sons Jaxon and Daniel. They reside in England and Los Angeles. Recent work In 2000, Tickle built the 120-track Avalon Studios at Kauai, Hawaii, where he mixed many 5.1 surround DTS records notably The Police's Greatest Hits album, Sting's ...Nothing Like the Sun and Ten Summoner's Tales, Sheryl Crow's album The Globe Sessions, and John Hiatt's album Bring the Family. Tickle will be working with Nikki‚Äôs Wives in late 2019. Productions Albums produced by David Tickle include: * 4 Non Blondes: Bigger, Better, Faster, More!

His work is most closely associated with Belfast, Northern Ireland.Ulster History Circle Biography Lanyon was born in Eastbourne, Sussex (now East Sussex) in 1813. His father was John Jenkinson Lanyon, a purser in the Royal Navy, and his mother was Catherine Anne Mortimer. Following his education, he became an apprentice civil engineer with Jacob Owen in Portsmouth. When Owen was made senior Engineer and Architect of the Irish Board of Works and moved to Dublin, Lanyon followed. In 1835 he married Owen's daughter, Elizabeth Helen. They had ten children, including Sir William Owen Lanyon, an army officer and colonial administrator. Charles Lanyon was County Surveyor in Kildare briefly, before moving on to Antrim in 1836. He remained County Surveyor of Antrim until 1860 when he resigned from the post to concentrate on private work and other interests. Lanyon was elected Mayor of Belfast in 1862, and Conservative MP for the city between 1865 and 1868. In 1868 he was also knighted and served on the Select Committee on Scientific Instruction, which laid the groundwork for the Education Act for Universal Education of 1871. He lost his seat in Westminster, but became a councillor in Belfast Town Council from 1861 to 1871. From 1862 to 1886 he was Belfast Harbour Commissioner. He served as Deputy Lieutenant for County Antrim and was appointed High Sheriff of Antrim in 1876. He was also a Justice of the Peace for many years.Country of Antrim, Grand Antrim Presentments, 1875 His other business interests included being director of the Blackstaff Flax Spinning Company and chairman of several railway companies. He was made director of the Northern Counties Railway in 1870, but resigned in 1887 because of ill-health. Alongside his business activities he was an active Freemason and served as Provincial Deputy Grand Master of Belfast and North Down between 1863 and 1868, Provincial Deputy Grand Master of Antrim between 1868 and 1883 and Provincial Grand Master of Antrim between 1883 and 1889. Lanyon lived at 'The Abbey' a grand house in Whiteabbey, which eventually became a sanitorium during World War I and is now part of Whiteabbey Hospital. He died there on 31 May 1889 and is buried in Knockbreda Cemetery. His will is recorded in the Public Records Office of Northern Ireland: > 8 August 1889, LANYON, Sir Charles, Effects ¬£53,785 1s 3d.

Lanyon memorial in Knockbreda Cemetery. Famous works The Lanyon Building is Queen's main building. Union Theological College, then Assembly's College, was Lanyon's work  Antrim Coast Road (1832‚Äì1842)  The north Antrim coast was difficult to reach for many years. The Irish Commissioners of Public Works promoted the construction of the Antrim Coast Road between 1832 and 1842 by civil engineer William Bald. Lanyon was the County Surveyor for part of this time (1836 to 1842) and would have had a considerable supervisory role. The route runs from Larne up through Ballygalley, Glenarm, Carnlough, Glenariff to Ballycastle. It involved removal of thousands of tonnes of rock using explosives, and building sea walls. Part of this route included the Glendun Viaduct.  Ballymoney Court House (1838)  This building one of Charles Lanyon's earlier buildings was completed in 1838. It cost ¬£1,125, plus ¬£40 for the bench and fitting up. It is made mostly of basalt blocks with brick dressings. The main doorway is surrounded by a thick stone frame. A lot of the window frames and sills are made of brown basalt. Strangely enough it is not currently a listed building.  Frosses Road (1839)  When a road was needed from Ballymena to Ballymoney, the straightest route was over the large Frosses Bog. Lanyon planted 1500 large Scots pinehttps://treecouncil.ie/treeregisterofireland/1160.htmhttp://biodiversityni.com/the- frosses trees in two lines so that the roots would intermingle, and would create a surface for a road to be built.  Glendun Viaduct, Glendun (1839)  This huge arch-shaped viaduct was finally completely built in 1839.  Palm House, Botanic Gardens, Belfast (1840)  The palm house was probably Lanyon's only building of this type. It is a Curvilinear Iron and Glass Structure, and is one of the oldest surviving examples in the world.  St. John's Church, Whitehouse (1840)  This Church of Ireland Church was opened in 1840, by licence. It cost ¬£716.16.0 to build. This was and still is one of the most successful churches in the Carnmoney Parish. It was designed for free by Lanyon who was a member of Carnmoney Parish. At the side of the church Lanyon built a small school hall for ¬£300, which was used as a school until 1930. Then it was used as a NAAFI mess for the troops in the second world war, but it was demolished in 1965 to make way for a new church hall.  St John's, Glynn (1841)  This was built in 1841 for a cost of ¬£800.  Raloo Parish Church, Glenoe (1842)  This church was built in 1842 for the cost of ¬£436.0.0. and was designed to hold the entire population of the village (less than 200).  Gills Almshouses, Carrickfergus (1842)  This was designed to replace the old charity houses in 1842 which were in very bad repair. The front is symmetrical on either sides with black bricks on the edge it is made of normal sandstone, painted white. The Almshouse was not always white. The original sandstone was crumbling away, so it was rendered. This explains why the white walls stand out from the cornerstones instead of the other way around. > Gill's Almshouses: A : 1842; Charles Lanyon, architect.

Ulster Architectural Heritage, Social Historic Buildings, Groups of Buildings and Areas of Importance in the Town of Carrickfergus (undated) Ulster Institute for the Deaf, Dumb and Blind, Lisburn Road, Belfast (1845) Lanyon built this large redbrick building on the Lisburn Road, on the site currently occupied by the Medical Biology Centre (MBC), Queen's University of Belfast on which he based Queens College. Unlike Queens, it was not kept well and it was demolished in 1965. Randalstown Viaducts, Randalstown (1847) Out of these two bridges, only the taller, newer one is designed by Sir Charles. This one bridge is a 4 arch viaduct. Queen's University (1849) Lanyon designed the main building of Queen's University of Belfast in 1849, the design for the central tower was based on Magdalen College in Oxford, and is repeated in the smaller towers. The back of the building is not as intricate as the front, as the college had problems with funding. The building is famous for its Gothic Revival facade and Great Hall. The main atrium of the Lanyon building houses a marble statue of Galileo. Most notable for his advances in Physics, he was also a deep thinker and Philosopher, resulting in the statue portrayed seated. It has been said that rubbing the statue's outstretched right foot brings the student good luck. Recent rumours have been spreading about the student body that when the clock above Galileo's head strikes the eleventh minute of the eleventh hour, the statue appears to wink. Some have put this down to simply being an optical illusion. The Great Hall underwent an extensive ¬£2.5m renovation in 2002, restoring it to Lanyon's original plans. The restoration was funded by the Heritage Lottery Fund and the hall was reopened by The Prince of Wales. Lanyon also designed the nearby Union Theological College.Queen's University Belfast The Abbey, Whiteabbey (1850) > Whiteabbey, a village in the parish of Carnmoney, Barony of Lower Belfast, > County of Antrim and province of Ulster, 4 miles (N.) from Belfast on the > shore of Belfast Lough; containing 71 houses and 391 inhabitants.

Lewis, Samuel, A Topographical Dictionary of Ireland, vol.II, London: S Lewis & Co., 1837, p712 This house was designed and built in 1850 for Richard Davison an MP, on the site of another MP, Samuel Getty, who had a gentleman's cottage on the site. It was named \\"The Abbey\\" because it was on the site of an ancient Cistercian Abbey which stood nearby from 1215 to 1925. Its entrance is very like Abbeydene, but with no pillars. > Abbey, the residence of William Getty Esquire, is a spacious and handsome > residence, possessing much taste in its style of construction and presenting > a handsomely ornamented and stone-finished front.

The Irish Builder, 1 December 1899, p200 The private treatment centre became Whiteabbey Sanatorium during World War 1, then developed into Whiteabbey Hospital in the 1930s, with the construction of the Lanyon Building. It is currently a non-acute medical and surgical hospital. Crumlin Road Gaol and Courthouse (1848/1850) HM Prison Crumlin Road Crumlin Road Courthouse Lanyon designed the Crumlin Road Gaol and opposite Courthouse between 1846 and 1850. Built in an innovative style at the time and based on London's Pentonville prison, the design is known as the \\"radial cellular system\\", and \\"The Crum\\" was the first to be built in Ireland. The building has four separate wings, each one either 3 or 4 stories high. In total there are 640 individual cells which have small windows on the doors, leading to the inspection hall. A tunnel links the gaol to the courthouse on the opposite side of the road. The building is currently derelict. However, due to its historical and architectural significance a major restoration and redevelopment is planned. The two buildings are linked by an infamous tunnel.NI Court Service People commented that Lanyon's experience with churches and lecture halls had influenced his design for the courthouse. Charles was instructed that the cost should not exceed ¬£16,000 but he tendered ¬£16,500 which was accepted. The building is two storied and in Neo-Palladian classical style. It was enlarged in 1905 when new blocks were added to either side of the fa√ßade. It was closed in June 1998 after nearly 150 years of use. It was sold to a private developer, Barry Gilligan in 2003. On 8 February 2004 there was a large fire which broke out in the Courthouse. The building was poorly secured and was used by local youths as a drinking den, but also was an attraction for Northern Ireland urban explorers. On 12 March 2009 the Courthouse was once again set on fire, destroying some of the front offices. Finally, on 15 August 2009, a major fire broke out destroying much of the remainder, and resulting in the building becoming hazardous. Abbeydene, Whiteabbey (1850) Abbeydene was built in 1850 for John Finlay, who was a flax and tow merchant. The building is made from gold sandstone, and has a grand front entrance with a tall wooden door and several sandstone pillars. From 1895 until 1915 Edward Robinson of \\"Robinson and Cleavers\\" lived here. Abbeydene was originally called Lismara when it was home to Sir Crawford McCullagh, 1st Baronet, renamed in 1948 when it became a nursing home. It was recently renovated and is now a single residence again. Waringstown Presbyterian Church (1853) Until 1846 Waringstown was part of the Dromore Presbytery. At this time the growing population of Presbyterians led to linen merchant John Henning presenting a request that the 80 families in the area be approved as a separate congregation. The service were held in the loft of the weaving factory adjacent to Murray House up the Banbridge Road. Michael McMurray was appointed as the Minister in 1848. He married into the Brown family who provided the site for The Desmesne in the village. In 1851the foundation for the new church in Mill Hill was laid and by 1853 the church was open for worship. The architect chosen to design the church was Ireland's foremost architect, Sir Charles Lanyon Belfast Custom House Considered by many to be Belfast's finest architectural feature, Lanyon designed the Custom House in 1857. Built in the Italian Renaissance style, the building features carved statues of Britannia, Neptune and Mercury. Until the 1950s the steps of the building served as Belfast's Speaker's Corner. It was here that trade union leader James Larkin addressed crowds of up to 20,000 people during the 1907 Belfast Dock strike. The writer Anthony Trollope was employed here before finding fame. Today Customs House Square and the adjoining Queen's Square are Belfast City Centre's main venue for free concerts and public events. McHugh's Bar and The Albert Clock are also located here.University Scholars Programme, National University of Singapore Sinclair Seaman's Presbyterian Church Lanyon designed Sinclair Seaman's Presbyterian Church in 1856. Thomas Sinclair commissioned the church in memory of his father John Sinclair, who was a merchant from Belfast. Located on Corporation Square in Belfast's docks area, locally known as Sailortown, the church has a distinctive maritime theme. The lectern is made in the shape of a ship's prow. It also features a brass wheel and capstan from a World War I wreck, navigation lights from a Guinness barge, and the ship's bell from the pre- World War I battleship HMS Hood. Castle Leslie Castle Leslie, situated in Glaslough, County Monaghan, Ireland, was designed by Lanyon in 1870 for John Leslie MP. Leslie was a descendant of Bishop Charles Leslie. Other works The Belfast Botanic Gardens Palm House Other works by Lanyon in Belfast include the Linenhall Library, Belfast Castle, the Palm House at the Belfast Botanic Gardens, Stranmillis House, The Assembly Rooms in Waring Street, the Masonic Hall in Arthur Square and both the Queen's Bridge and Ormeau Bridge. He also designed Falls Road Methodist Church, Divis Street, Belfast, which was opened in 1854 and closed in 1966 when it was replaced by Divis Tower. Campanile of Trinity College, Dublin, designed by Lanyon. Outside of Belfast, Lanyon is famous for planting the Frosses Trees in 1839. Lanyon planted approximately 1,500 Scots Pine trees along the edge of what is now the A26 road, just north of the town of Ballymena. The overhanging trees are a well-known landmark for travellers en route to the north Antrim coast. For safety reasons the majority of the original trees have been cut down, with just 104 remaining.Irish News (pdf) The Campanile of the University of Dublin, Trinity College, was designed by Lanyon and completed in 1853. Lanyon designed an extension to the east side of The Royal St. George Yacht Club in Kingstown (now D√∫n Laoghaire) in 1865 which was accepted in principle. However uproar was caused at Committee level by the proposal, and it was rejected in favour of an alternative proposal by E.T. Owen. Lanyon redesigned Killyleagh Castle and designed Drenagh Estate, bridges, viaducts and mausoleums and over 50 churches in Belfast and throughout Ireland. Legacy Alongside William J. Barre, Lanyon is considered Belfast's most important architect of the Victorian era. During this period Belfast was expanding greatly, becoming Ireland's most important industrial city, briefly becoming larger in population than Dublin. Lanyon formed a partnership in 1854 with his former apprentice William Henry Lynn. In 1860 the two incorporated with Charles' son John Lanyon as Lanyon, Lynn & Lanyon, Civil Engineers and Architects. Lanyon, Lynn & Lanyon was dissolved in 1872. A blue plaque commemorating Lanyon is displayed at his former offices in Wellington Place. The location of Belfast's Waterfront Hall was named Lanyon Place in his honour. The Sir Charles Lanyon Memorial Prize is awarded to a final-year BSc Architecture student from the School of Architecture at Queen's University each year.

Yotsuya Kaidan (), the story of Oiwa and Tamiya Iemon, is a tale of betrayal, murder and ghostly revenge. Arguably the most famous Japanese ghost story of all time, it has been adapted for film over 30 times and continues to be an influence on Japanese horror today. Written in 1825 by Tsuruya Nanboku IV as a kabuki play, the original title was T≈çkaid≈ç Yotsuya Kaidan (; translation: Ghost Story of Yotsuya in Tokaido). It is now generally shortened, and loosely translates as Ghost Story of Yotsuya. History First staged in July 1825, Yotsuya Kaidan appeared at the Nakamuraza Theater in Edo (the former name of present-day Tokyo) as a double- feature with the immensely popular Kanadehon Chushingura. Normally, with a Kabuki double-feature, the first play is staged in its entirety, followed by the second play. However, in the case of Yotsuya Kaidan it was decided to interweave the two dramas, with a full staging on two days: the first day started with Kanadehon Chushingura from Act I to Act VI, followed by T≈çkaid≈ç Yotsuya Kaidan from Act I to Act III. The following day started with the Onbo canal scene, followed by Kanadehon Chushingura from Act VII to Act XI, then came Act IV and Act V of T≈çkaid≈ç Yotsuya Kaidan to conclude the program. The play was incredibly successful, and forced the producers to schedule extra out-of-season performances to meet demand. The story tapped into people‚Äôs fears by bringing the ghosts of Japan out of the temples and aristocrats' mansions and into the home of common people, the exact type of people who were the audience of his theater. Story As the most-adapted Japanese ghost story, the details of Yotsuya Kaidan have been altered over time, often bearing little resemblance to the original kabuki play, and sometimes removing the ghostly element altogether. However, the base story usually remains the same and recognizable. (Note: the following summary is of the original 1825 Nakamuraza production. As such, it does not detail the numerous subplots and characters added to the story over the intervening years.) Act 1 Tamiya Iemon, a r≈çnin, is having a heated exchange with his father-in-law, Yotsuya Samon, concerning Samon's daughter Oiwa. After it is suggested by Samon that Iemon and his daughter should separate, the ronin becomes enraged and murders Samon. The next scene focuses on the character Naosuke who is sexually obsessed with Oiwa's sister, the prostitute Osode, despite her being already married to another man, Sat√¥ Yomoshichi. As this scene begins, Naosuke is at the local brothel making romantic advances toward Osode when Yomoshichi and the brothel's owner, Takuetsu, enter. Unable to pay a fee demanded by Takuetsu, he is mocked by both Yomoshichi and Osode and forcibly removed. Shortly after an intoxicated Naosuke murders Okuda Sh√¥zabur√¥, his former master, who he mistakes for Yomoshichi. This is implied to occur at the precise time of the slaying of Samon. It is at this point that Iemon and Naosuke unite and conspire to mislead Oiwa and Osode into believing that they will exact revenge on the people responsible for their father's death. In return Osode agrees to marry Naosuke. Act 2 Oume, the granddaughter of It√¥ Kihei, has fallen in love with Iemon. However, believing herself to be less attractive than Oiwa, she doesn't think Iemon will ever want to become her husband. Sympathizing with Oume's plight, the It√¥s scheme to have Oiwa disfigured by sending her a topical poison disguised as a facial cream. Oiwa, unbeknownst to her at the time, is instantly scarred by the cream when she applies it. Upon seeing his wife's ghastly new countenance, Iemon decides he can no longer remain with her. He asks Takuetsu to rape Oiwa so that he will have an honorable basis for divorce. Takuetsu cannot bring himself to do this so, instead, he simply shows Oiwa her reflection in a mirror. Realizing that she has been deceived, Oiwa becomes hysterical and, picking up a sword, runs towards the door. Takuetsu moves to grab her but Oiwa, attempting to evade him, accidentally punctures her own throat with the sword's tip. As she lies bleeding to death before a stunned Takuetsu, she curses Iemon's name. Not long after, Iemon becomes engaged to Oume. Act 2 closes with Iemon being tricked by Oiwa's ghost into slaying both Oume and her grandfather on the night of the wedding. Act 3 The remaining members of the It√¥ household are annihilated. Iemon kicks Oyumi, the mother of Oume, into the Onb√¥ Canal and Omaki, the servant of Oyumi, drowns by accident. Naosuke arrives in disguise as Gonbei, an eel vendor, and blackmails Iemon into handing over a valuable document. Iemon contemplates his prospects while fishing at the Onb√¥ canal. On the embankment above the canal Iemon, Yomoshichi and Naosuke appear to fumble as they struggle for possession of a note which passes from hand to hand in the darkness. Act 4 At the opening Naosuke is pressuring Osode to consummate their marriage, to which she seems oddly averse. Yomoshichi appears and accuses Osode of adultery. Osode resigns herself to death in atonement and convinces Naosuke and Yomoshichi that they should kill her. She leaves a farewell note from which Naosuke learns that Osode was his younger sister. For the shame of this, as well as for the killing of his former master, he commits suicide. Act 5 Iemon, still haunted by the ghost of Oiwa, flees to an isolated mountain retreat. There he rapidly descends into madness as his dreams and reality begin to merge and Oiwa's haunting intensifies. The act closes with Yomoshichi slaying Iemon out of both vengeance and compassion. Historical basis Nanboku incorporated two sensational and real-life murders into Yotsuya Kaidan, combining fact and fiction in a manner that resonated with audiences. The first involved two servants who had murdered their respective masters. They were caught and executed on the same day. The second murder was from a samurai who discovered his concubine was having an affair with a servant. The samurai had the faithless concubine and servant nailed to a wooden board and thrown into the Kanda River. Popularity Yotsuya Kaidan's popularity is often accounted for by the way it fit the mood of its time, as well as its use of universal themes. The Bunsei era was a time of social unrest, and the repressed position of women in society was severe. The exchange of power for powerlessness was something audiences could relate to. Oiwa went from a delicate victim to a powerful avenger, while Iemon transforms from tormentor to tormented. Also, Oiwa is much more direct in her vengeance than Okiku, another popular kabuki ghost, and she is much more brutal. This added level of violence thrilled audiences, who were seeking more and more violent forms of entertainment. In addition, the performance of Yotsuya Kaidan was filled with fantastic special effects, with her ruined face projecting magnificently from an onstage lantern, and her hair falling out in impossible amounts. Yotsuya Kaidan paired the conventions of kizewamono \\"raw life play\\", which looked at the lives of non-nobles, and kaidanmono \\"ghost play\\". Ghost of Oiwa Hokusai's image of Oiwa emerging from the Lantern. Oiwa is an onry≈ç, a ghost who seeks vengeance. Her strong passion for revenge allows her to bridge the gap back to Earth. She shares most of the common traits of this style of Japanese ghost, including the white dress representing the burial kimono she would have worn, the long, ragged hair and white/indigo face that marks a ghost in kabuki theater. There are specific traits to Oiwa that set her apart physically from other onryou. Most famous is her left eye, which droops down her face due to poison given her by Iemon. This feature is exaggerated in kabuki performances to give Oiwa a distinct appearance. She is often shown as partially bald, another effect of the poison. In a spectacular scene in the kabuki play, the living Oiwa sits before a mirror and combs her hair, which comes falling out due to the poison. This scene is a subversion of erotically-charged hair combing scenes in kabuki love plays. The hair piles up to tremendous heights, achieved by a stage hand who sits under the stage and pushes more and more hair up through the floor while Oiwa is combing. Oiwa is supposedly buried at a temple, Myogyo-ji, in Sugamo, a neighborhood of Tokyo. The date of her death is listed as February 22, 1636. Several productions of Yotsuya Kaidan, including television and movie adaptations, have reported mysterious accidents, injuries and even deaths. Prior to staging an adaptation of Yotsuya Kaidan it is now a tradition for the principal actors and the director to make a pilgrimage to Oiwa's grave and ask her permission and blessing for their production. This is considered especially important of the actor assuming the role of Oiwa. Sadako Yamamura from the film Ring is a clear homage to Oiwa. Her final appearance is a direct adaptation of Oiwa, including the cascading hair and drooping, malformed eye. Also in Ju-on when Hitomi is watching the television, the television presenter is morphed into a woman with one small eye and one large eye- possibly a reference to Oiwa. Yotsuya Kaidan and ukiyo-e Being a popular Kabuki play, Yotsuya Kaidan soon became a popular subject for ukiyo-e artists as well. In 1826, the same year the play opened at Sumiza Theater in Osaka, Shunkosai Hokushu produced The Ghost of Oiwa. She is recognizable by her drooping eyes and partial baldness. An unusual image featuring a still-living Oiwa was depicted as one of the New Forms of Thirty-Six Ghosts by Tsukioka Yoshitoshi. Katsushika Hokusai created perhaps the most iconic image of Oiwa, in his series One Hundred Ghost Stories, in which he drew the face of her angry spirit merged with a temple lantern. Shunkosai Hokuei made a visual quotation of Hokusai's design in the illustration above, including Iemon as he turns to meet the apparition, drawing his sword. The lantern scene is a favorite, also being carved into netsuke. This image of Oiwa appears to give Akari Ichijou a cup of tea in her victory pose in the arcade game The Last Blade. Utagawa Kuniyoshi illustrated the scene at Hebiyama, showing a still-lantern-headed Oiwa coming for Iemon, surrounded by snakes and smoke. Film adaptations The first film adaptation was made in 1912, and it was filmed some 18 times between 1913 and 1937. A notable adaptation was Shimpan Yotsuya Kaidan by It≈ç Daisuke, one of the foremost Japanese directors of his time. A 1949 adaptation, The New Version of the Ghost of Yotsuya (Shinshaku Yotsuya kaidan)Galbraith, Stuart (1994). Japanese Science Fiction, Fantasy and Horror Films. McFarland. p. 324., by Kinoshita Keisuke removed the ghostly elements and presented Oiwa as an apparition of her husband's guilty psyche. It was also known as The Phantom of Yotsuya. The Shintoho studio produced Nobuo Nakagawa's 1959 Ghost of Yotsuya (Tokaido Yotsuya kaidan)Galbraith,Stuart (1994). Japanese Fantasy, Science Fiction and Horror Films. McFarland and Co., Inc., which is often considered by critics to be the finest screen adaptation of the story. Toho produced a version of Ghost of Yotsuya in 1965 directed by Shir≈ç Toyoda and starring Tatsuya Nakadai that was released as Illusion of Blood abroad.Galbraith, Stuart (1994). Japanese Science Fiction, Fantasy and Horror Films. McFarland. p. 357. In 1994, Kinji Fukasaku returned to the Kabuki roots and combined the stories of Ch≈´shingura and Yotsuya Kaidan into the single Crest of Betrayal. There have also been adaptations on television. Story 1 of the Japanese television drama Kaidan Hyaku Shosetsu was a version of Yotsuya Kaidan,Kaidan Hyaku Shosetsu [ÊÄ™Ë´áÁôæÁâ©Ë™û] :: jdorama.com and episodes 1-4 of Ayakashi: Samurai Horror Tales, a 2006 anime television series, were also a retelling of the story. By tradition, production crews adapting the story for film or stage visit Oiwa's gravesite in Myogyoji Temple in Sugamo, Toshima-ku, Tokyo to pay their respects, as an urban legend states that injuries and fatalities will befall the cast if they do not.

He played college football for the University of Virginia Cavaliers and was signed as a defensive end by the New York Jets of the National Football League (NFL) in the first round of the 1989 NFL Draft. In 1994, he was signed by the Jacksonville Jaguars; he retired after an injury in 1998. Though considered small for a defensive lineman, he distinguished himself on the field, recording a total of 47 career quarterback sacks. Following his retirement from sports he went into sports broadcasting in Jacksonville, Florida. Early life Lageman was born in Fairfax, Virginia. He attended Park View High School in nearby Sterling. He attended the University of Virginia for college, where he played both linebacker and defensive end for the Virginia Cavaliers football team. Professional career Although considered undersized to play defensive end in the NFL, a fact that was pointed out by Mel Kiper Jr. during ESPN's coverage of the 1989 NFL Draft, Lageman was taken in the first round by the New York Jets. Lageman's NFL career spanned 10 seasons, the first six with the Jets, and the final four with the Jacksonville Jaguars. His best year came in 1991 when he made ten quarterback sacks. He made a career total of 47 sacks in the NFL. In 1995 Lageman was signed by the Jacksonville Jaguars in their inaugural year. With Lageman playing a key role, the Jaguars made the 1996 playoffs and upset the Buffalo Bills and the Denver Broncos on the road before losing to the New England Patriots in the AFC Championship Game. Lageman's playing career ended on the first game of the 1998 season in Chicago. Although the Jaguars won on a last second touchdown pass from Mark Brunell to Jimmy Smith, they lost Lageman to a torn muscle in his arm. He never played again. Retirement During his time in Jacksonville, Lageman, an avid hunter and fisherman, began his broadcasting career with a radio show titled \\"The Outdoors Show\\" along with Captain Kevin Faver and Captain Kirk Waltz. After his playing career, Lageman continued his broadcasting career as a football color analyst on Fox television. By 2001, \\"The Outdoors Show\\" had moved from an all-sports station (WBWL-AM) to a 50,000 watt news-talk station (WOKV) and soon after, Lageman joined the play-by-play man Brian Sexton in the booth of the Jaguars Radio Network as the color analyst. He also serves as co-host of the weekly \\"Jaguars This Week\\" radio show along with Sexton, Jaguars.com senior writer John Oehser and former Jaguars teammate Tony Boselli, and is a castmember of the weekly television program, Jaguars All Access. Lageman lives in Jacksonville with his wife, Tera Lageman, and their children Taylor and Dylan.

He founded a series of orphanages, and the religious congregations of the Rogationist Fathers and the Daughters of Divine Zeal. His feast day is June 1.Sch√§fer, Joachim. \\"Hannibal Maria di Francia\\", √ñkumenisches Heiligenlexikon, July 29, 2018 Childhood His father Francis was a Knight of the Marquises of St. Catherine of Jonio, Papal Vice-Consul and Honorary Captain of the Navy. His mother, Anna Toscano, belonged to the noble family of the Marquises of Montanaro. His brother, Francesco was declared Venerable in 2019. The third of four children, he lost his father when he was only fifteen months old. This experience would profoundly affect his life and made him deeply empathetic towards orphans.Hannibal Mary Di Francia (1851-1927), Vatican News Service At the age of seven he enrolled in the College of St. Nicholas, run by the Cistercian Fathers. He was a devout child. Here under the guidance of his spiritual director, he was introduced to a devout life and he developed such love for the Eucharist that he was allowed to receive Holy Communion daily, something exceptional in those days. Student Young Francia proved to be of high intelligence and had a poetic disposition. When he was fifteen years old he continued his studies under the tutelage of the famous Sicilian poet Felice Bisazza.Saint Hannibal Di Francia He looked to a brilliant and secure career as a writer and poet but chose the religious life. He was only seventeen, when as he was at prayer in front of the Blessed Sacrament, he was given the \\"revelation of Rogate\\", that is, he deeply felt that vocations in the church only come through prayer. Later on he found in the Gospel the very words of Jesus commanding such prayer: \\"Beg the harvest master to send out laborers to gather his harvest\\". (Mt 9:38; Lk 10:2). These words became the main source of inspiration for his life and the charism which led his apostolate.'Pope Blesses Statue of Pray-For-Vocations Saint\\", Zenit, July 7, 2010 On July 11, 1909, he wrote to Pope Pius X: \\"From my youth I have devoted myself to the words of the Gospel: Pray therefore the Lord of the Harvest...In my charitable institutions, orphans, poor, priests and nuns, all pray incessantly to the loving Hearts of Jesus and Mary, to the Patriarch St. Joseph and to the Apostles, that they may provide the Holy Church with numerous and chosen laborers for the harvest of souls\\". When, on December 8, 1869, he was given the clerical garb, he soon began putting his talents to work and became a well received preacher. People, especially the simple and those from the lower classes, loved to listen to him because of the clarity of his sermons. Because of his intense ardor for the Blessed Virgin of Mount Carmel, he sought to enter the Discalced Carmelites. Upon discovering this, Archbishop Giuseppe Guarino discouraged him in his ideas, but encouraged him rather to stay in Avignone to continue working with the poor. For this reason, Francia entered the Third Order Carmelites. Priest of God and Servant of His People Once his theological studies were completed he was ordained a priest on March 16, 1878. A few months before his ordination, when he was still deacon, he met a poor blind beggar, Francesco Zancone, who \\"providentially\\" led him to discover a world unknown to him: \\"Le Case Avignone\\" (The Avignone squatters), in the outskirts of Messina. It was to be his new field of apostolate. He defined this as the \\"spirit of a twofold charity: the evangelization of and the care for the poor\\". Together with the intuition of the \\"Rogate\\", this spirit of charity would be the characteristic of his life. Anthonian Orphanages With the blessing of his Archbishop and the encouragement of John Bosco he began an evening school for boys, a day kindergarten for girls from five to eight years old. Then, the girl's orphanage got under way and, on November 4, 1883, the boys' orphanage. He placed them under the patronage of St. Anthony of Padua. Later on all his charitable institutions for poor children will be called \\"Anthonian Orphanages\\". He was concerned that in his institutions the children were provided not only with food and prepared for a job, but more importantly that they would receive a solid moral and religious education. After their elementary-grade instruction, the girls were involved in sewing, knitting, and home economics in general. He used to say: \\"We should love children with tender and fatherly love. This is the secret of secrets to gain them to God\\". Thirteen sisters were killed in the earthquake of 1908. Although the boys dormitory collapsed none of the orphans there or at the girls residence lost their lives. Additional orphanages were opened: including one in Bari for orphans of the 1910 cholera epidemic, and one in Altamura for orphans of the First World War. The monthly periodical entitled \\"God and Neighbor\\" was first published in 1908. Having a modest format and a circulation that rose to more than half a million, it spread throughout the five continents. \\"God and Neighbor,\\" the organ of all the Anthonian orphanages lasted until 1942. Rogationist Fathers With the help of those who were his most reliable collaborators - Pantaleone Palma and Francis Vitale - he was able to lay the groundwork of his male congregation, which he named after the Rogate: The Rogationist Fathers of the Heart of Jesus. He perceived that the \\"Rogate\\" was the answer to his query. \\"What are these few orphans we attend to, these few people we bring the good news to, compared to the millions who are lost and abandoned as sheep without a shepherd?...I looked for an answer and I found a complete one in the words of Jesus: \\"Beg the harvest master to send out laborers to gather his harvest\\". I concluded then that I had found the secret key to all good works and to the salvation of countless souls\\" .Preziose Adesioni, 1903 Daughters of Divine Zeal Francia decided to found his own congregation of nuns whom he called Daughters of Divine Zeal, patterned after the inspiration of the Rogate - the expression of the zeal burning in the Sacred Heart of Jesus for the glory of the Father and the salvation of souls. The Institute was given a one-year trial. During that year, he had as a cooperator for his work none other than Melanie Calvat, the famous young shepherdess to whom the Mother of God appeared on the mountain of La-Salette. Melanie remained at the Institute for one year, from September 1897 to September 1898 - a year which, in the words of Francia, was a year of blessing. The trial period was weathered successfully, having a healthy and vigorous effect on the community, and the women's congregation was put on a safe footing. He was noted for propagating the devotion of the \\"Servitude of Love\\" taught by Louis de Montfort and he embodied the spirit of complete abandonment into the hands of Mary. His charity knew no bounds, and it was directed toward all those in need, including priests facing difficulties and cloistered nuns who often are forgotten by benefactors. In Messina they used to say: \\"This is the house of Fr. Di Francia. Have a seat and you'll get something to eat.\\" People regarded him as a Saint even when he was still alive. Angelo Paino, Bishop of Messina, later gave this testimony about him: \\"He was considered a Saint by all people. By this I mean people from all walks of life, social status and religious convictions\\". Death and canonization The Villa Torneamento in Monza a still-existing school called Padre Annibale di Francia On June 1, 1927, Saint Hannibal died in Messina.\\"A Brief Chronology of the Life of Saint Annibale Maria Di Francia\\", Daughters of Divine Zeal As soon as the people heard the news of his death they began to say: \\"Let us go to see the sleeping saint\\". A few days before the Blessed Virgin Mary had appeared to him and assured him of Her protection, a vision to reward his tender devotion toward him. Newspapers of the entire region reported with pictures and articles of the funeral and burial. Crowds of thousands came to mourn his passing away. Local authorities quickly released the permit allowing that his body be buried in the church of the \\"Evangelical Rogation\\" which Francia himself had built in Messina. It is the only church in the world dedicated to the Gospel's passage: \\"Pray therefore the Lord of the Harvest\\". Many of his contemporaries, and among them Luigi Orione, requested that a formal Cause for Canonization be promptly started. But World War II put a temporary stop to the undertaking. On April 21, 1945, the information stage of the process for Canonization began with the \\"Diocesan Investigations\\". All the writings of Saint Hannibal (62 volumes) were examined by a Special Committee of Theologians. In 1979 the Congress of Cardinals voted to begin the formal Cause for Canonization which officially began in Messina on March 8, 1980, at the same time the Eccliastical Tribunal set up a Committee of Historians. On December 21, 1989, pope John Paul II promulgated the Decree on the \\"Heroic Virtues of the Servant of God\\". To proceed with the Cause of Canonization, a sign of God, a miracle was needed. On June 30, 1990, the Medical Commission of the Congregation for the Causes of Saints unanimously agreed that the case of Gleida Danese - a young Brazilian girl who was doomed to die because of the rupture of the aorta but who suddenly recovered - had no possible medical explanation. Both the Commission of Theologians on July 14, 1990, and then the Congress of Cardinals and Bishops on July 27, 1990, unanimously agreed upon the miraculous recovery of the girl and found that it was to be attributed to the intercession of the Servant of God, Hannibal Di Francia. Francia was beatified on 7 October 1990 by Pope John Paul II. He was canonized on May 16, 2004, by Pope John Paul II.Canonization of six new saints Legacy Today the religious families founded by Francia are present in the five continents of the world. In the spirit of their Founder, they dedicate themselves to a variety of apostolates. They work in institutions for orphans and abandoned children, schools for deaf and blind, homes for aged and pregnant girls, educational institutions and vocational schools, missions and parishes, religious printing houses and vocation centers which promote the ideals of \\"Rogate\\". The message and the mission of Francia is not only valued among those involved in vocation ministry and those who have at heart the formation of the clergy but also by all those who have come to understand the need of prayer for more vocations in the Church. Pope Paul VI on January 23, 1964, instituted the \\"World Day of Prayer for Vocations\\". Since then, every year, the Popes remind the universal Church that still today salvation comes to us through the work of many and holy ministers of the Gospel and that to obtain them from God we must pray. On July 7, 2010, Benedict XVI blessed a marble statue of St. Hannibal Mary di Francia (1851-1927), founder of the Congregation of the Rogationist Fathers of the Heart of Jesus and of the Daughters of Divine Zeal. The statue is positioned in an external niche of the Vatican Basilica near the Arch of the Bells.

It is found in lakes in northern Europe, especially Finland, Lithuania, Sweden, Russia and Estonia, and in some lakes of Norway, the United Kingdom, northern Germany, and Poland. It is also found in diluted brackish water in the Gulfs of Finland and Bothnia, both of which are in the Baltic Sea. The length of an adult is normally about . The maximum age is about ten years. Fried vendace with mashed potatoes has been staple food in Finland. The vendace is traditionally the most important target of freshwater fisheries in parts of Fennoscandia and Russia. Vendace roe is considered a delicacy, which has been granted a PDO status in the Swedish Bothnian Bay archipelago (Kalix l√∂jrom). Description The vendace is a slim, streamlined fish with an adipose fin - an additional small fin on the back between the dorsal fin and the tail (caudal fin), as is typical of the salmon family. Its lower jaw is longer than the upper one. It is similar in appearance to both the common whitefish (Coregonus lavaretus sensu lato), whose upper jaw is longer than its lower one, and the peled (Coregonus peled), whose jaws are of equal length. The back is bluish green or brown, the flanks are silvery and the belly white. This fish seldom grows more than long. Biology Vendace mainly feed on zooplankton, such as small crustaceans and their larvae, but larger fish also feed on floating insects and fish fry. The fish live in schools made up of large groups of individuals. They lay their eggs on pebbly or sandy ground, some in shallow water and others at depths of down to . The fish mature at a young age and most spawn for the first time in their second year, but a few may breed in their first autumn.  Systematics  The European vendace is very closely related to the Siberian Coregonus sardinella (sardine cisco) and also to C. peled, although phenotypic differences are clear.Bernatchez L, Colombani F, Dodson JJ (1991) Phylogenetic relationships among the subfamily Coregoninae as revealed by mitochondrial DNA restriction analysis Journal of Fish Biology 39 (Suppl A):283-290. Within the vendace, taxonomic subdivisions have been suggested both on geographical grounds and between sympatric ecotypes. FishBase lists the British populations of vendace as a separate species, Coregonus vandesius, but this distinction is not accepted by all scientists. Coregonus albula generally breeds in the autumn, but in several North European lakes distinct spring-spawning populations of vendace exist, some of which have been described as separate species: in Sweden, as Coregonus trybomi, and in two lakes of northern Germany, as Coregonus fontanae and Coregonus lucinensis. These populations are sympatric with autumn-spawning vendace and seem to have evolved post-glacially from them independently in each lake.

The transition to Modern Norwegian is usually dated to 1525, or 1536, the year of the Protestant Reformation and the beginning of the kingdom of Denmark‚ÄìNorway (1536-1814). In contrast to Old Norse, Modern Norwegian has simplified inflections and a more fixed syntax. Old Norse vocabulary is to a considerable degree substituted by Low German, and this is the main reason why Modern Norwegian, together with contemporary Norwegian in general, Danish and Swedish, is no longer mutually intelligible with Insular Nordic (Icelandic and Faroese), except from some Nynorsk/H√∏gnorsk and dialect users to a lesser extent. While Modern Norwegian is a linguistic term with a specific historical meaning, contemporary Norwegian also includes the Dano-Norwegian koin√© now commonly known as Standard √òstnorsk (Standard East Norwegian) and the related official written standard Bokm√•l. Standard √òstnorsk is spoken by a large and rapidly growing minority of Norwegians, and Bokm√•l is by far the most widely used written language, even among users of Modern Norwegian dialects. In contrast to Nynorsk The Norwegian linguistic term for Modern Norwegian is nynorsk, literally New Norwegian. Nynorsk is also the name of a Norwegian written standard based on Modern Norwegian dialects, as opposed to Bokm√•l, which branched off the Danish language after the dissolution of Denmark‚ÄìNorway in 1814 and was gradually reformed using the Norwegian dialects and Nynorsk as a guideline. The terms Nynorsk, Modern Norwegian and Contemporary Norwegian are somewhat confusing, because in Norwegian the same term Nynorsk is used for the first two, while Contemporary Norwegian could easily be called moderne norsk (literally Modern Norwegian) in Norwegian.

Two years later in 1954 the first L-Spatz 55 was airborne. Three hundred L-Spatz 55s were built in Germany, 155 in France under the name Avialsa A.60 Fauconnet, and 16 in Italy as the Meteor MS-30 L Passero; production was discontinued in 1962. It is a single-seater cantilever shoulder-winged sailplane with a cruising (max L/D) speed of 45 mph. It has an empty weight of 157 kg and a maximum take-off weight of 269 kg. The single spar wing and tail were constructed using fabric-covered wood, whereas the fuselage consisted of steel tubing covered with fabric. The L-Spatz 55 has good climbing performance due to light construction. The glide angle is 29:1. The longest known cross- country flight was more than 600 km from Burg Feuerstein, Germany to France.

While a Government House is the official residence of a viceroy or governor who represents the monarch, many Commonwealth nations now operate without the British Monarch as Head of State. To avoid confusion, several of these nations refer to their presidential palaces as a State House or President's House. When Queen Elizabeth II or a member of the Royal Family visits a Commonwealth nation, they will often stay at the Government House, which is reported in the Court Circular.

It is found in North America from southern Ontario to Massachusetts; most of England; on the eastern and southern edges of Scotland; and central Ireland but not the coastal edges. It flowers between June and October and its flowers have a diameter of 3‚Äì5 cm. The root and buds are edible, and it has a milky latex. Description It grows 30 to 100 cm tall. It differs from viper's-grass (Scorzonera humilis) in that Viper's-grass has short, pale green bracts, whereas in Goat's-beard they are long and pointed. The lower leaves are 10 to 30 cm long, lanceolate, keeled lengthwise, grey-green, pointed, hairless, with a white midrib. The upper leaves are shorter and more erect. It is the only United Kingdom dandelion type flower with grass like leaves. The flower heads are 5 cm wide. They only open in the morning sunshine, hence the name 'Jack go to bed at noon'. The achenes are rough, long beaked pappus radiating outwards interwoven like a spider's web of fine white side hairs (referred to as a \\"Blowball\\").

From Sendagaya Station, the main station in Sendagaya, bustling Shinjuku is a tranquil 10-minute walk away along the Imperial Gardens' western wall. Sendagaya Entrance to the gardens is 2 minutes away from Sendagaya Station. Sendagaya, particularly 3-ch≈çme, is home to dozens of clothing and accessory design workshops, studios, offices, and fashion related agencies, including the mega-brand Bape. The narrow streets are filled daily with the hustle and bustle of courier companies picking up next season's designs and delivering the finished product. Places of interest=CulturalTheatre= Sendagaya includes several theaters and organizations related to the arts, such as the National Noh Theatre, designed by Hiroshi Oe and completed in 1983. Also, the Kinokuniya Southern Theater, the classical music Tsuda Hall (Ê¥•Áî∞„Éõ„Éº„É´), the Japan Federation of Composers, the Japan Theatre Arts Association, the Japan Association of Music Enterprises, the Tokyo Nikikai Opera Foundation, a troupe of opera singers dedicated to promoting and developing the western music movement, and the Japanese Centre of the International Theatre Institute are located in Sendagaya. Torii Gates in Hato no Mori Hachiman Shrine =Shrines= A few minutes walk from the station, is the , an oasis of calm with its 300-year-old pine trees. This small shrine is a place of historical importance in Shibuya. Within the shrine, there is a stage for Japanese performing arts and a fujizuka, a replica of Mount Fuji made from stones carried from Mt. Fuji. Fujitsuka were common in Japan during the Edo period and were constructed to allow people to make a symbolic pilgrimage to the sacred Mt. Fuji when travel between domains (han) was not permitted for commoners under most circumstances. This fujitsuka is one of the few that survive in Tokyo. Sports A number of sports' complex are found nearby Sendgaya Station including the Olympic Stadium, Tokyo (which actually sits in Shinjuku-ku) built for the 1958 Asian Games and subsequently used for the 1964 Summer Olympics. Near the stadium, are other important venues, such as Meiji Jingu Skate and Curling Rink and Futsal Courts, the Meiji Jingu Stadium used by the Yakult Swallows baseball team, Jingu Secondary Stadium, Chichibunomiya Rugby Stadium, and the Tokyo Metropolitan Gymnasium (Êù±‰∫¨‰ΩìËÇ≤È§®). Sunny day at Tokyo Metropolitan Gymnasium Modern Japanese architecture is on display directly in front of Sendagaya Station at the metro gymnasium, which houses an Olympic size swimming pool, as well as a shorter 25m pool; an outdoor oval running track; a weight training room; and large indoor arena (photo opposite). The futuristic designed main arena, half built below ground, which seems to hover over the surrounding area, is used for a number of national and international sporting events, including the WTA Toray Pan Pacific Tennis Championships. The Tokyo Metropolitan Gymnasium, built in 1991, was designed by Japanese architect and Pritzker Prize winner Fumihiko Maki.

Bystr√≠k's bishopric Bystr√≠k lived during the time when the first King of Hungary, Stephen I, undertook the Christianization of the Hungarian clans. Stephen I appointed Bystr√≠k as bishop of Nitra, Kingdom of Hungary (the city is in Slovakia today) around the year 1034. The exact place and time of birth of St. Bystr√≠k is unknown, however he seems to have come from aristocratic family who had been Christianised in the mission of Cyril and Methodius before the end of the Great Moravian Empire in 907 AD. It is assumed that Bystr√≠k graduated from the school at Zobor Abbey. The disciples of Cyril, and St. Gorazd were spreading out from Zobor at this time, and included Astrik, Prokop, Svorad, Benedict and Maurus. Martyrdom According to legend, Bystr√≠k was murdered during the Vatha pagan rising of 1046 near the Danube in present-day Budapest together with bishop Gerard Sagredo () and bishop Buldus (B≈ëd), as they were en route to Budapest for the coronation of the future king, Andrew I of Hungary. On September 24, the bishops were attacked by Vatha's mob, who began stoning them. Buldus died immediately. Bystr√≠k, together with bishop Beneta, managed to flee on a boat across the Danube river. Bystr√≠k was mortally wounded by a sword on the Pest river bank by the pagans before they could be rescued by the incoming Andrew I. Bystr√≠k died on September 27, the third day after the attack.  Canonisation  Bystr√≠k was canonised during the reign of King Ladislaus I of Hungary in 1083. The remembrance day of Saint Bystr√≠k falls on September 24. In Hungary, this is the day when Saint Gerard Sagredo is celebrated together with his co-martyrs, Saint Bystr√≠k and Saint Buldus. Veneration Reverence for Saint Bystr√≠k is not very widespread, but there are approximately two dozen of his pictures throughout Slovakia and Hungary, and in Slovak communities in Australia, Canada, Italy, Poland and the United States. Saint Bystr√≠k can be seen on frescos, on glass and bells, as well as on paintings made on wood and fabric. The oldest picture of him dates back to the times of baroque and can also be found in the book of the Jesuit Gabriel Hevenesi entitled Ungaricae Sanctitatis Indicia from the year 1692 as Hoffman's copperplate. On September 15, 2006 the first church was devoted to him in Nemce not far from Bansk√° Bystrica, Slovakia. There is a church dedicated to Saint Bystr√≠k in Hajn√° Nov√° Ves. Saint Bystr√≠k's House is in ƒåiƒçmany (Slovakia).  Attributes  Saint Bystr√≠k is portrayed as a bishop with a book and all attributes that denote the person of a bishop: cope, mitre, crosier, gloves, and ring of the bishop. In his left hand, apart from the book, he often holds a sword that is the symbol of the way he died. Sometimes he is portrayed with a boat, on which he travelled across the Danube river. Historicity Bystr√≠k is mentioned not only in records of the Nitra bishopric, but his name appears also in the Vatican secret archives. The earliest mention of it can be found in the legend of St. Gerard (13th century). Legend describes the events from the time of the Hungarian uprising in 1046 when Bishops Buldu and Bystr√≠ka rescue Bishop Benett from the hands of insurgents. Most Hungarian chronicles of later periods which were taken over from the legendary description of the events surrounding the martyrdom of Bishop Gerard included a description of the martyrdom of St. Bystr√≠ka. He is also mentioned in the Chronicon Pictum of the 14th century, Buda Chronicle, Chronicle Dubnick√°, Vienna picture chronicle, Munich chronicle, written in German chronicle of Henry of Mugello and chronicles of John Thuroczius and Antonio Bonfini(1491 - 1496). Considering the tradition of St. Bystr√≠k as bishop of Nitra is old. The first surviving historical sources proving his involvement in Nitra are the Annales ecclesiastici regni Hungariae by Melchior Inchofer dating from 1644 AD. According to current historiography, the historicity of Bystrik is uncertain. He could however be historical and may have served King Stephen I sometime around 1034 AD.

It was also known as the Tower Hamlets, and took its name from the military obligations owed to the Constable of the Tower of London. In contemporary terms, the Liberty covered inner East London, the area now administered by the eponymous modern London Borough of Tower Hamlets together with most of the modern London Borough of Hackney (Shoreditch and Hackney proper). The Liberty was seen as synonymous with East London until East London extended further, east of the Lea and into Essex. The Tower Division was formed sometime in the 17th century but the much older administrative units comprising the area were united in shared military obligations long before this time. The Liberty had judicial and some local government responsibilities, and its military function was unique. County within a county The growth of population around the City of London led to the Ossulstone Hundred being divided into four Divisions, with each division taking on the role of the Hundred - The other three divisions of the Hundred were named Finsbury, Holborn and Kensington. The Tower Division was different from the other divisions in that it also took on the judicial, civil and military responsibilities held at county level, making the Tower Hamlets a \\"county within a county\\", comparable to the Ridings of Yorkshire. The area had its own Justices of the Peace (JPs),https://www.dhi.ac.uk/strype/TransformServlet?page=book1_077 appointed by the Constable of the Tower (as Lord Lieutenant), who administer both judicial and civil functions, mainly through their quarter sessions. The civic functions included: *Repair of roads and bridges *Highway diversions *Construction and maintenance of county buildings *Administration of county prisons. *Supervision of public and private lunatic asylums *Supervision of petty sessions *Licensing of public houses *Supervision of the English Poor Laws (pre-1834) *Some responsibilities around the militia *The police *Setting county rates Unlike the other divisions, the Tower Division was outside the jurisdiction of the Lord Lieutenant of Middlesex, with the Constable of the Tower exercising lieutenancy powers, usually with the ex-officio title of Lord Lieutenant of the Tower Hamlets. This began when the right of the Constable to exact guard duty was extended in 1605 to the raising of a militia, the Tower Hamlets Militia. Counties were the principle way in which military forces were raised and the creation of the liberty and exemption from county based obligations saw East London made a distinct military unit.The London Encyclopaedia, 4th Edition, 1983, Weinreb and Hibbert The Metropolitan Board of Works was established in 1855 in order to lead on the provision of infrastructure in the capital, and this is likely to have led to a reduced responsibilities for the Tower Hamlets JPs. The area's special status ceased in 1889 with the creation of the County of London, and the creation of a Lord Lieutenant for the new county. The Tower division appears to have persisted as a magistracy area well into the 20th century.Question in the House of Commons, 1926 https://api.parliament.uk/historic- hansard/commons/1926/may/03/magistracy-tower-division- london#S5CV0195P0_19260503_HOC_124 Military function The Tower of London was normally garrisoned by a small force of Yeoman Warders, but these were supplemented by sometimes large numbers of local Hamlets men, Hamleteers, at times of increased tension. There was also the Tower Hamlets Militia which could be deployed in the field in the event of invasion or rebellion. There was no peacetime standing army in England until the interregnum , and when regular units were formed they were typically raised from wider geographical districts than the Tower Hamlets, however the area has provided some examples of regular forces. Origins The earliest surviving reference to the inhabitants of the Tower Hamlets having a duty to provide a guard for the Tower of London dates from 1554, during the reign of Mary I. Sir Richard Southwell and Sir Arthur Darcye were ordered by the Privy Council in that year to muster the men of the Hamlets \\"whiche owe their service to the Towre, and to give commaundement that they may be in aredynes for the defence of the same. This was long before the creation of the Liberty, and as the Hamlets are described as \\"owing\\" service there must have been a customary duty long before that date.website focussing on the Trained Bands in the War of the Three Kingdoms (English Civil War) http://traynedbandes.co.uk/before-the-war/ It can be speculated that that duty had its origin in the rights and obligations of the Manor of Stepney which once covered most or all of the Hamlets area.The map shows the extent of the TD, which corresponds to Stepney, except for Shoreditch which was also held by the Bishops https://www.british- history.ac.uk/vch/middx/vol11/pp1-7 English Civil War London and the eastern counties were firmly in sympathy with Parliament and against the King from the outset of hostilities. In the early years of the English Civil War both Parliament and the King relied on local Militias such as that of the Tower Hamlets. Generally speaking these forces were county based and very reluctant to leave their home areas. A notable few organised \\"Trained Bands\\" of more highly motivated and reliable men willing to spend more time training ‚Äì Tower Hamlets had a large Trained Band ready to serve outside the Liberty and this would later be organised into large regiment. The Tower Hamlets Trained Bands saw action at Basing House, Cropredy Bridge and Newbridge. The White Tower and Traitors' Gate in the 15th century Regimental Flag designs varied but some versions featured the Tower of London's White Tower with the Traitors' Gate watergate in the foreground. The troops wore buff sleeveless jackets to mark them out as a Trained Band, soldiers with higher status and value than ordinary Militia. Fusiliers In 1685, during the Monmouth Rebellion, King James II raised a force of infantry from the Tower of London garrison; the Tower Hamlets Militia. The Regiment was formed of two companies of Militia and one of miners and was known as the Ordnance Regiment and was soon renamed the Royal Fusiliers, after the fusil, the type of musket they were equipped with. The Tower Hamlets Militia helped form the Fusiliers and subsequent Tower Hamlets reserve units would come under the organisational wing of the regiment. The regiment later became known as the 7th Regiment of Foot (Royal Fusiliers) and The Royal Fusiliers (City of London Regiment) before merging with other Fusilier regiments to form the Royal Regiment of Fusiliers in 1968. The modern regiment is headquartered at the Tower of London and maintains a museum there. Militia and Volunteers While most UK militia fell into disuse in the early 19th century, the Tower Hamlets Militia endured, becoming known in the late 19th century as the Tower Hamlets Militia (Queen's Own Light Infantry) and using the White Tower as its cap badge. An invasion scare of 1857 saw the creation of the Volunteer Force which included both Engineer and Rifle Volunteer Corps and which in the case of the Tower Hamlets supplemented the existing militia. These Volunteer units were raised by members of the community with the permission of their county's Lord Lieutenant, but as Tower Hamlets was effectively a 'county within a county', having its own Lord Lieutenant (the Constable of the Tower), it raised units in its own right (though in the Tower Hamlets, as elsewhere, not all units raised bore the name of their Lord Lieutenancy area). A significant number of units were raised, a noteworthy example being the East Metropolitan RVC (11th Tower Hamlets) which was entirely made up of Jewish Volunteers.Jewish Community Records Website https://www.jewishgen.org/JCR- UK/susser/twrhamlets.htm initially published in The Bulletin of the Military Historical Society, Vol. 48, No 191, February 1998 The profusion of units, some very short lived before being amalgamated or discontinued, makes the lineage of Tower Hamlets units sometimes unclear. The Cardwell Reforms of 1871 saw the volunteer element of the armed forces re-organised and given more supervision and support from central government. The local engineer unit became known at this time as the 2nd Tower Hamlets (East London) Engineer Volunteers. The infantry units retained their local identity but became reserve forces attached to a regular regiment, The Rifle Brigade (The Prince Consort's Own). The Militia appear to have become the 7th Bn,the metadata on this page strongly suggests the lineage http://discovery.nationalarchives.gov.uk/details/r/C4429126 the 2nd Tower Hamlets Rifle Volunteer Corps became the 9th Bn and the 1st Tower Hamlets Rifle Volunteer Brigade (THVRB) also joined the regiment but retained its own name. In 1881 these latter two unit became part of the East London Brigade for training and mobilisation purposes but remained part of The Rifle Brigade (The Prince Consort's Own) regiment. The 1st Tower Hamlets Rifle Volunteer Brigade (THVRB) used the White Tower as its cap badge at this time and used the Tower of London moat for training and drilling.The Tower Hamlets Rifle Volunteer Brigade (1st Tower Hamlets Rifle Volunteers) A Short History by ET Rodney Wilde Machine Gun elements of this unit were sent to the 2nd Boer War and earned a battle honour at Colenso. In 1904 the 1st Tower Hamlets Rifle Volunteer Brigade (THVRB) was transferred from The Rifle Brigade (The Prince Consort's Own) regiment to the Royal Fusiliers a historic regiment originally formed in 1685 primarily from Tower Hamlets men. First World War Recruitment poster for the Tower Hamlets Rifles, c.1930 In 1908 London's reserve infantry forces were re-organised to form a new London Regiment, though the Tower Hamlets units retained their local identities and traditions and affinities gained while attached to regular regiments. The 4th Bn Royal Fusiliers (previously the 1st Tower Hamlets Rifle Volunteer Brigade) became the 4th Bn while the 9th Bn The Rifle Brigade (The Prince Consort's Own) (previously the 2nd Tower Hamlets) became the 17th (County of London) Battalion, The London Regiment (Poplar and Stepney Rifles). Both these units saw extensive combat in the First World War. The army's need for expansion saw the 4th (City of London) Battalion, London Regiment \\"duplicated\\" to form four battalions (1/4th, 2/4th, 3/4th and 4/4th); while the Poplar and Stepney Rifles were \\"duplicated\\" to form the 1/17th, 2/17th and 3/17th. The Tower Hamlets Engineers, by now a part of the wider Royal Engineers and retaining their local identity but not their name, was also heavily involved in the conflict. In 1926 the Poplar and Stepney Rifles was renamed the 17th London Regiment (Tower Hamlets Rifles). Second World War In 1937 the London Regiment was abolished and the Tower Hamlets Rifles were transferred back to The Rifle Brigade (The Prince Consort's Own) regiment, seeing action in North Africa and Italy. The increasing importance of aerial warfare saw the former 4th (City of London) Battalion, London Regiment being transferred to the Royal Artillery (RA) as an Anti-aircraft artillery unit, the 60th (City of London) AA Brigade, RA (TA). The unit retained its Tower Hamlets identity, if not its name, and saw action on the home front and in continental Europe. Descendent units of the Tower Hamlets Engineers were also extensively involved in the conflict. Cold War After the war the Tower Hamlets units lost their identities through a series of amalgamations. The longest to bear the local name were the Tower Hamlets Rifles who went through the Second World War as infantry. Both these Tower Hamlets Battalions (9th and 10th) of the Rifle Brigade were amalgamated to form 656th Light Anti-Aircraft Regiment, Royal Artillery (Tower Hamlets) TA in 1947 and from 1961-1967 were known as the 300th (Tower Hamlets) Light Air Defence Regiment RA (TA). In 1967 a further amalgamation saw the loss of local identity in this last Tower Hamlets unit and the last of the Tower Hamlets name in the British Army. Some current British Army units, recruited on a much broader geographical basis, count Tower Hamlets units as part of their historic lineage. Extent In 1829 the Tower Division contained the following \\"parishes, townships, precincts and places\\": *The parish of St Mary, Whitechapel *The parish of Christchurch, Spitalfields *The parish of St Leonard, Shoreditch *The liberty of Norton Folgate *The parish of St John, Hackney *The parish of St Matthew, Bethnal Green *The hamlet of Mile End Old Town *The hamlet of Mile End New Town *The parish of St Mary, Stratford Bow *The parish of Bromley St Leonard *The parish of All Saints, Poplar *The parish of St Anne, Limehouse *The hamlet of Ratcliff *The parish of St Paul, Shadwell *The parish of St John, Wapping *The liberty of East Smithfield *The precinct of St Catherine *The liberty of His Majesty's Tower of London consisting of: **The precinct of Tower Within **The precinct of Old Tower Without **The liberty of Old Artillery Ground **The parish of Minories Holy Trinity **The precinct of Wellclose Namesakes=Parliamentary Borough From 1832 to 1885 there was a Parliamentary Borough named \\"Tower Hamlets\\", after the Tower Division. From 1832 to 1868 it occupied the same boundaries as the Tower Division, with the best known MP for the area being Joseph d'Aguilar Samuda, a well known shipbuilder and an officer in the 2nd Tower Hamlets Rifle Volunteer Corps. After 1868, population growth saw the constituency split in two; the southern part of the area kept the name Tower Hamlets while Hackney, Shoreditch and Bethnal Green became part of a new Hackney constituency. The southern, Tower Hamlets constituency, persisted until 1885. Modern Borough of Tower Hamlets The name \\"Tower Hamlets\\" was subsequently used for the modern London Borough of Tower Hamlets created in 1965 from southern areas of the Tower Division. The Shoreditch and Hackney proper areas of the Tower Division together make up most of the area of the modern London Borough of Hackney.

The engineering was developed by Vittorio Zignoli of Polytechnic University of Turin. No helicopters were used, and all the workers were chosen among locals and alpine guides. After a construction period of four years, it began service in 1958. The cable car connects the peaks of Aiguille du Midi ( altitude) and Pointe Helbronner ( altitude), over a distance of some . This tourist attraction spans the valleys between the two peaks, high above the Mont Blanc Tunnel, which carries automotive passenger and freight traffic under the two peaks. System The Vall√©e Blanche Cable Car has fixed track cables (one each direction) carrying 12 groups of 3 small cabins each which are pulled by a haulage rope of in a single loop. The cabins take some 30 to 35 minutes for the whole distance, including 5 short stops corresponding the stops of the cabins arriving in the stations at either end. The cabins run from the Aiguille du Midi station ( altitude) across a span of over Vall√©e Blanche, a glacier and snow valley, to the Gros Rognon station (). The Gros Rognon station is not a passenger station--it contains the counterweights of the fixed cables and the rails bending the horizontal direction of the cables by some 8¬∞ to the right. Beyond the Gros Rognon, the cabins cross the G√©ant Glacier and snow valley, a span of between supports. Although the cables sag by some , the cabins still have a clearance of some to the glacier underneath. Between the rocks of the Large and the Small Flambeau, three long steel cables are installed, which take over the role of the cable support (Pyl√¥ne suspendu / Suspended Support Pillar). During construction, it was decided to build this unique configuration, because the glacier is unsuitable for high tower construction. Between the anchors of these cables at either side, there is a difference in altitude of , resulting in these cables having a horizontal inclination of some 23¬∞ to the direction of the tramway. From this support the cable car runs to Pointe Helbronner ( altitude). The two peaks have their own cable car system connecting them to their nearby villages. The French T√©l√©ph√©rique de l'Aiguille du Midi connects the peak of Aiguille du Midi to the village of Chamonix, while the Italian Skyway Monte Bianco (Funivie Monte Bianco) connects the peak of Pointe Helbronner to the village of La Palud, just north of Courmayeur.

The United Kingdom of Portugal, Brazil and the Algarves was formed in 1815, following the transfer of the Portuguese Court to Brazil during the Napoleonic invasions of Portugal, and it continued to exist for about one year after the return of the Court to Europe, being de facto dissolved in 1822, when Brazil proclaimed its independence. The dissolution of the United Kingdom was accepted by Portugal and formalized de jure in 1825, when Portugal recognized the independent Empire of Brazil. During its period of existence the United Kingdom of Portugal, Brazil and the Algarves did not correspond to the whole of the Portuguese Empire: rather, the united kingdom was the transatlantic metropolis that controlled the Portuguese colonial empire, with its overseas possessions in Africa and Asia. Thus, from the point of view of Brazil, the elevation to the rank of a kingdom and the creation of the United Kingdom represented a change in status, from that of a colony to that of an equal member of a political union. In the wake of the Liberal Revolution of 1820 in Portugal, attempts to compromise the autonomy and even the unity of Brazil, led to the breakdown of the union. History=Establishment The United Kingdom of Portugal, Brazil and the Algarves came into being in the wake of Portugal's war with Napoleonic France. The Portuguese Prince Regent (the future King John VI), with his incapacitated mother (Queen Maria I of Portugal) and the Royal Court, fled to the colony of Brazil in 1808. With the defeat of Napoleon in 1815, there were calls for the return of the Portuguese Monarch to Lisbon; the Portuguese Prince Regent enjoyed life in Rio de Janeiro, where the monarchy was at the time more popular and where he enjoyed more freedom, and he was thus unwilling to return to Europe. However, those advocating the return of the Court to Lisbon argued that Brazil was only a colony and that it was not right for Portugal to be governed from a colony. On the other hand, leading Brazilian courtiers pressed for the elevation of Brazil from the rank of a colony, so that they could enjoy the full status of being nationals of the mother-country. Brazilian nationalists also supported the move, because it indicated that Brazil would no longer be submissive to the interests of Portugal, but would be of equal status within a transatlantic monarchy. By a law issued by the Prince Regent on 16 December 1815, the colony of Brazil was thus elevated to the rank of a Kingdom and by the same law the separate kingdoms of Portugal, Brazil and the Algarves were united as a single State under the title of The United Kingdom of Portugal, Brazil and the Algarves. This united kingdom included the historical Kingdom of the Algarves, which is the present-day Portuguese region of Algarve. The titles of the Portuguese royalty were changed to reflect the creation of this transatlantic united kingdom. The styles of the Queen and of the Prince Regent were changed accordingly to Queen and Prince Regent of the United Kingdom of Portugal, Brazil and the Algarves. The title Prince of Brazil, a title that used to pertain to the heir apparent of the Portuguese Crown, was dropped shortly afterwards, in 1817, being replaced by the title of Prince Royal of the United Kingdom of Portugal, Brazil and the Algarves, or Prince Royal for short. A new flag and coat of arms were also adopted for the new State. Succession of John VI King Jo√£o VI of the United Kingdom of Portugal, Brazil and the Algarves in Rio de Janeiro On 20 March 1816 Queen Maria I died in Rio de Janeiro. Prince John, the Prince Regent, then became King John VI, the second monarch of the United Kingdom, retaining the numbering of Portuguese Sovereigns. After a period of mourning and several delays, the festivities of the acclamation of the new King were held in Rio de Janeiro on 6 February 1818. On the date of his Acclamation, King John VI created the Order of the Immaculate Conception of Vila Vi√ßosa, the only order of knighthood to be created during the United Kingdom era. This Order existed in the United Kingdom alongside the old Portuguese Orders of chivalry and the Order of the Tower and Sword, an ancient Order that had been dormant and that was revived by the Portuguese monarchy in November 1808, when the Royal Court was already in Brazil. After the dissolution of the United Kingdom, while Brazilian branches of the old Orders of chivalry were created, resulting in Brazilian and Portuguese Orders Saint James of the Sword, of Saint Benedict of Aviz, and of Christ (there was and is also a branch of the Order of Christ maintained by the Holy See: the Supreme Order of Our Lord Jesus Christ), paradoxically, the newer Orders (the recreated Order of the Tower and Sword and the Order of the Immaculate Conception of Vila Vi√ßosa) remained in existence as Portuguese Orders only. John VI's return to Europe King John disembarks in Lisbon in 1821, after 13 years in Brazil After the Liberal Revolution of 1820 in Portugal, the King left Brazil and returned to the European portion of the United Kingdom, arriving in Lisbon on 4 July 1821. Before his departure, the King, acceding to requests made by Brazilian courtiers, decided to leave behind his heir apparent, Prince Pedro, the Prince Royal of the United Kingdom. By a decree issued on 22 April 1821, the King invested Pedro with the title of \\"Regent of Brazil\\", and granted him delegated powers to discharge the \\"general government and entire administration of the Kingdom of Brazil\\" as the King's placeholder, thus granting the Kingdom of Brazil a devolved administration within the United Kingdom. Accordingly, with the appointment of Prince Royal Pedro as Regent of Brazil, the Brazilian provinces ‚Äì that in the colonial period were united under a vice-regal administration, and that during the stay of Queen Maria I and King John VI in the American Continent remained united directly under the royal Government ‚Äì continued, after the return of the King and of the Portuguese Court to Europe, united under a central Brazilian Government based in Rio de Janeiro. Prince Pedro's Regency not only assured the unity of the Brazilian people under one government, but it also enjoyed a high degree of autonomy vis-√†-vis the Government of the United Kingdom. Attempts by the Government in Lisbon to terminate Brazil's home rule and to undermine Brazilian unity would lead to the proclamation of the independence of Brazil and the dissolution of the United Kingdom. Dissolution of the United KingdomLead-up to the dissolution= The Cortes of the United Kingdom of Portugal, Brazil and the Algarves assembled in Lisbon in the wake of the 1820 Portuguese Revolution. The Cortes (the Parliament) assembled in Lisbon in the wake of the Constitutional Revolution of 1820 to draft a Constitution for the United Kingdom was composed of mostly Portuguese delegates. This was so because the Revolution was Portuguese in origin, so that the members of the Cortes were elected in Portugal, and only later a Brazilian delegation was elected and the Brazilian delegates crossed the Atlantic to join the ongoing deliberations. Also, Brazilian representatives were often mistreated and persecuted in the streets by Portuguese citizens who resented the end of colonial rule. On top of that, Brazilians were under-represented in the Cortes. As for the King, upon his arrival in Lisbon, he behaved as though he accepted the new political settlement that resulted from the Liberal Revolution (a posture he would maintain until mid-1823), but the powers of the Crown were severely limited. A Council of Regency that had been elected by the Cortes to govern Portugal in the wake of the Revolution ‚Äì and that replaced by force the previous governors that administered the European portion of the United Kingdom by royal appointment ‚Äì handed back the reins of government to the Monarch on his arrival in Lisbon, but the King was now limited to the discharge of the Executive branch, and had no influence over the drafting of the Constitution or over the actions of the Cortes. The Constituent Cortes, dominated by a Portuguese majority, included provisions in the Constitution being drafted that referred to the people of the United Kingdom as \\"the Portuguese Nation\\". The draft Constitution spoke of \\"Portuguese citizens of both hemispheres\\". Apart from including in the Constitution language that was seen as hostile and offensive to Brazilians, the United Kingdom Cortes assembled in Lisbon included in the proposed Constitution that was being drafted provisions that would undermine and that could even lead to the dissolution of the central Brazilian Government based in Rio de Janeiro. The draft Constitution would have maintained the Regency of the Kingdom of Brazil, but it contained provision allowing the United Kingdom Legislature to exclude Brazilian provinces from the jurisdiction of the Regency. Thus, the Government of the United Kingdom in Lisbon would have the power to sever the links between a Brazilian province and the central Brazilian government, submitting this province directly to the Lisbon Government. If enacted, those deliberations of the Cortes would not only undermine Brazilian Home Rule, but they would also endanger the unity of the Brazilian people, as Brazilians would no longer have a central government, a situation that did not exist even in the last centuries of the colonial period. Portuguese deputies in the Cortes even introduced draft legislation that would concretely sever the ties between the central devolved Government of the Kingdom of Brazil in Rio de Janeiro and some provinces in Northeastern Brazil. The Portuguese Cortes also demanded the immediate return of the Crown Prince to Europe. Pedro, then Prince Regent of the Kingdom of Brazil, orders officer Jorge d'Avillez to return to Portugal after his unsuccessful rebellion, February 1822 Brazilian Nationalists reacted, interpreting the actions of the Cortes as an attempt to \\"divide and conquer\\". They alleged that once the provisions approved by the Cortes were enacted and enforced, Brazil, although formally remaining a part of the transatlantic monarchy, would be in reality returned to the condition of a Colony. Brazilians feared the breakup of Brazil, with the creation of provinces directly subject to the Lisbon Government. Also, language in the draft Constitution that would have the effect of including colonies of the Portuguese colonial empire in Africa and Asia as part of the territory of the United Kingdom seemed to confirm that the intention of the Cortes was indeed to reduce Brazil to the position of a colony once again: it was clear that the territories in Africa and Asia would continue to be colonies, and to be subject to economic exploitation and domination by means of restrictions in foreign trade, etc.; but those colonies would now be declared parts of the United Kingdom, meaning that, with the inclusion of the whole of the Portuguese Empire in the United Kingdom, the definition of the United Kingdom itself would change: the United Kingdom would cease to correspond to a transatlantic State that included no colonies but that controlled colonies overseas, and would instead become a State that included colonies in its bosom. This would provide the legal framework for the reintroduction of trade restrictions in Brazil that had been lifted since the arrival of the Royal Family in Brazilian shores. Notably, several Portuguese politicians wanted to re-introduce to Brazil restrictions in foreign trade that in the previous colonial era had been dubbed euphemistically as the colonial pact: a mercantilist system in which Brazilian products could only be exported to Portugal, and in which Brazilians could only import products from Portugal. This system, which enabled the economic exploitation of the Portuguese Colonies by Metropolitan Portugal, had been abolished in Brazil even before the creation of the United Kingdom. Indeed, the abolition of all the restrictions on foreign trade, and the exclusion of Brazil from the imperialist policy of the colonial pact, had taken place already in 1808, as soon as the Royal Family arrived in Brazil: the first act signed by the Prince Regent after his arrival in Brazil was the decree on the opening of the Brazilian ports to friendly Nations, that enabled Brazilians to import goods from Nations other than Portugal, and to export Brazilian products to the foreign Nations maintaining diplomatic ties with the Portuguese Empire. Now, with the measures being voted by the Cortes assembled in Lisbon, that economic freedom was under threat. Faced with that scenario, Brazilian independentists managed to convince Prince Pedro to stay in Brazil against the orders of the Cortes, that demanded his immediate return. He thus continued leading a central Brazilian Government as Regent, and further established that no laws, decrees or instructions issued by the Portuguese Cortes or by the central government of the United Kingdom would be obeyed in Brazil without his fiat. The Prince's decision not to obey the decrees of the Cortes that demanded this return, and instead to stay in Brazil as its Regent was solemnly announced on 9 January 1822, in reply to a formal petition from the city council of Rio de Janeiro. In February 1822 Prince Pedro decided to create an advisory council, composed of representatives elected to represent the several provinces of Brazil, summoning elections to that council. Its first meeting was held on 2 June 1822. Prince Regent Pedro's decree to the effect that laws, decrees and orders from Lisbon would only be carried out in Brazil with his fiat was published in May 1822. By agreeing to defy the Cortes and stay in Brazil, Prince Pedro assumed the leadership of the Brazilian cause; as a recognition of his leading role, Brazilian independentists offered Pedro on 13 May 1822 the title of \\"Perpetual Protector and Defender of Brazil\\"; he rejected the title of Protector, arguing that Brazil didn't need one, but assumed the title of \\"Perpetual Defender of Brazil\\". By defying explicit orders that demanded his return to Europe, Pedro escalated the events that would lead to the separation of Brazil from the United Kingdom, and hastened the crucial moment of the Proclamation of Independence. As the situation between Brazilians and Portuguese deteriorated, the United Kingdom was doomed to dissolution. Brazilian independentists argued that Brazil's future should be decided by Brazilians and not by the Lisbon Cortes, and they accordingly demanded the summoning of a National Constituent Assembly for Brazil, separate from the Constituent Cortes assembled in Portugal. Prince Pedro, acting on the advice of his newly convened Council, embraced those demands, and issued a decree on 13 June 1822 summoning elections for a Brazilian Constituent Assembly. Due to the further escalation of tensions between Brazil and Portugal, the elections to that Constituent Assembly would only take place after the Prince himself had proclaimed the independence of Brazil (the Assembly would only convene in 1823, and the independence of Brazil was declared in September 1822, with the establishment of the Empire of Brazil in October 1822). The Cortes sent troops to Brazil to compel the dissolution of the Prince's Government and to force his return to Portugal as ordered, but, on arrival those troops were commanded by the Prince to return to Portugal. The Portuguese troops in Rio de Janeiro obeyed the Prince Royal and returned to Europe, but in other Provinces fighting erupted between Brazilians and Portuguese. =Proclamation of Independence= Prince Pedro on 7 September 1822 News of further attempts of the Portuguese Cortes aimed at dissolving Prince Pedro's Regency led directly to the Brazilian Proclamation of Independence. Accordingly, in 1822, the Regent of the Kingdom of Brazil, Prince Pedro, the son of John VI, declared the independence of Brazil, as a reaction against the attempts of the Cortes to terminate Brazilian home rule, and became Emperor Pedro I of Brazil, which spelled the end of the United Kingdom. The independence of Brazil was proclaimed by Prince Pedro on 7 September 1822. The Proclamation of Independence was made while the Prince was in the Province of S√£o Paulo. He had travelled there to secure the Province's loyalty to the Brazilian cause. He departed the city of S√£o Paulo, the Province's capital, on 5 September, and on 7 September, while on his way back to Rio de Janeiro, he received mail from his Minister Jos√© Bonif√°cio de Andrada e Silva and from his wife, Princess Leopoldina (who remained in Rio de Janeiro presiding over the Ministry during Prince Pedro's absence), informing Pedro of further acts by the Cortes aimed at dissolving his Government by force, insisting on his return to Lisbon and attempting to void his later acts as Regent of the Kingdom of Brazil. It was clear that independence was the only option left. Pedro turned to his companions that included his Guard of Honor and spoke: \\"Friends, the Portuguese Cortes want to enslave and pursue us. From today on our relations are broken. No ties can unite us anymore\\" and continued after he pulled out his blue-white armband that symbolized Portugal: \\"Armbands off, soldiers. Hail to the independence, to freedom and to the separation of Brazil from Portugal!\\" He unsheathed his sword affirming that \\"For my blood, my honor, my God, I swear to give Brazil freedom,\\" and later cried out: \\"Independence or death!\\". This event is remembered as \\"Cry of Ipiranga\\", because it took place next to the riverbank of the Ipiranga brook. The Prince then decided to return urgently to the city of S√£o Paulo, where he and his entourage arrived in the night of 7 September. There, they announced the news of the Prince's Proclamation, and of Brazil's separation from Portugal, and were met with great popular acclaim. Less than a month later, on 23 September 1822, the Lisbon Cortes, still unaware of the Brazilian declaration of independence, approved the Constitution of the United Kingdom, that was then signed by the members of the Cortes and presented to the King. Between 23 September and 1 October, the members of the Cortes, including Brazilians that still took part in its deliberations, took oaths to uphold the Constitution. In a solemnity on 1 October 1822, King John VI appeared before the Cortes, made a speech from the Throne declaring his acceptance of the Constitution, swore an oath to uphold it, and signed an instrument of assent that was included in the text of the Constitution after the signatures of the members of the Cortes, declaring that the king had accepted the Constitution and sworn to abide by it. On 4 October, acting as the Cortes had directed, the Portuguese King signed at the Royal Palace of Queluz a Charter of Law promulgating the text of the Constitution and ordering its execution by all his subjects throughout the United Kingdom. This Charter of Law, containing the full text of the Constitution, including the signatures of the members of the Cortes and the King's instrument of assent, was published on the following day, 5 October 1822. Due to the Brazilian secession from the United Kingdom, that Constitution was never recognized in Brazil and was only effective in Portugal. Pedro I as the first Emperor of Brazil on 1 December 1822 That the newly independent Brazilian Nation would adopt a constitutional monarchy as its form of Government and that Prince Pedro would be the new State's monarch were obvious facts to all the leaders involved in the process of Brazilian emancipation, but still, for a little more than one month after the 7 September 1822 Proclamation of Independence, Prince Pedro initially continued to use the title of Prince Regent, as he did not want to declare himself monarch, preferring instead to accept the new country's Crown as an offer. This led several local councils to adopt motions and addresses asking the Prince Regent to assume the title of King, or of Emperor (there were no legislatures in the provinces, and also no national legislature existed at that time; the municipal councils were the only existing legislatures, and since the colonial era they had substantial authority). The municipal council of the city of Rio de Janeiro and the other municipal councils of the province of Rio de Janeiro then organized a ceremony of acclamation, with the support of the Prince Regent's Government. The municipal council of Rio de Janeiro voted to instruct its president to offer Prince Pedro the title of Emperor. Then, the Prince's Advisory Council, a body that was not a legislative assembly, but was composed of councillors elected from all Provinces of Brazil to represent its peoples and advise the Prince Regent (the Conselho de Procuradores das Prov√≠ncias do Brasil or Council of the Representatives of the Provinces of Brazil), advised the Prince Regent to accede to the several requests already presented and to assume the imperial title. On 12 October 1822, Prince Pedro accepted the offer of the new Brazilian Throne and was acclaimed the first Emperor of the independent Empire of Brazil. Although Portuguese monarchs were not crowned since the 16th century, it was decided by the newly created imperial Government that the Brazilian monarchy, then recently instituted, should adopt different customs, both to differentiate itself from the Portuguese model and to highlight its status as a distinct institution, from a separate and independent country. Thus, it was decided that Emperors of Brazil should be consecrated, anointed and crowned with the full Catholic coronation ritual. Also, in the context of the struggle to sustain the newly declared independence of Brazil, and to seek recognition for the Empire, the religious act of coronation would establish Emperor Pedro I as an anointed monarch, crowned by the Catholic Church. It was regarded that this could improve his legitimacy in the eyes of other Christian monarchies, and it would also confirm the alliance between the newly declared State and the Church in Brazil. Accordingly, the coronation of Emperor Pedro I took place on 1 December 1822. =Recognition of independence= The Brazilian declaration of independence and foundation of the Empire of Brazil led to a War of Independence. The Portuguese initially refused to recognize Brazil as a sovereign state, treating the whole affair as a rebellion and attempting to preserve the United Kingdom. However, military action was never close to Rio de Janeiro, and the main battles of the independence war took place in the Northeastern region of Brazil. The independentist Brazilian forces overpowered the Portuguese forces as well as the few local forces that were still loyal to Portugal, and the last Portuguese troops surrendered in November 1823. Compared to the wars of independence waged by Spanish colonies during the decolonization of the Americas, the Brazilian Independence War did not result in significant bloodshed, although land and naval battles were fought. The Portuguese military defeat, however, was not followed by swift recognition of the new country's independence. Instead, from 1822 to 1825 the Portuguese Government engaged in heavy diplomatic efforts to avoid the recognition of Brazil's independence by the European Powers, invoking the principles of the Congress of Vienna and subsequent European alliances. Those foreign Nations, however, were keen on establishing trade and diplomatic ties with Brazil. Under British pressure, Portugal eventually agreed to recognize Brazil's independence in 1825, thus allowing the new country to establish diplomatic ties with other European powers shortly thereafter. In 1824, in the wake of the adoption of the Constitution of the Empire of Brazil on 25 March that year, the United States of America became the first nation to recognize the independence of Brazil and the consequential disbandment of the United Kingdom. Portugal recognized the sovereignty of Brazil only in 1825. Since a coup d'et√°t on 3 June 1823 the Portuguese King John VI had already abolished the Constitution of 1822 and dissolved the Cortes, thus reversing the Liberal Revolution of 1820. On 4 January 1824 King John VI issued a Charter of Law confirming as in force the \\"traditional laws of the Portuguese Monarchy\\", thus ratifying the restoration of the absolutist r√©gime in Portugal. There were two Portuguese acts of recognition of Brazilian independence. The first was unilateral and purporting to be constitutive of such independence, the second was bilateral and declaratory. The Brazilian Army entering Salvador after the surrender of Portuguese forces in 1823 The first act of recognition was materialized in Letters Patent issued on 13 May 1825, by which the Portuguese King \\"voluntarily ceded and transferred the sovereignty\\" over Brazil to his son, the Brazilian Emperor, and thus recognized, as a result of this concession, Brazil as an \\"Independent Empire, separate from the Kingdoms of Portugal and Algarves\\". The second act of recognition was materialized in a Treaty of Peace signed in Rio de Janeiro on 29 August 1825, by means of which Portugal again recognized the independence of Brazil. This Treaty was ratified by the Emperor of Brazil on 30 August 1825, and by the King of Portugal on 15 November 1825, and entered into force in international Law also on 15 November 1825 upon the exchange of the instruments of ratification in Lisbon. On the same date of the signature of the Portuguese instrument of ratification and of the exchange of the ratification documents between the representatives of the two Nations, the Portuguese King also signed a Charter of Law, a statute, ordering the execution of the Treaty as part of the domestic Law of Portugal. The Treaty was incorporated as part of the domestic Law of Brazil by a Decree of Emperor Pedro I signed on 10 April 1826. The reason why there were two separate acts of recognition of the independence of Brazil is this: in the wake of the Brazilian victory in the War of Independence, the Portuguese king initially attempted to recognize Brazilian independence unilaterally so as to ignore the fact of the Portuguese defeat and transmit the impression that Portugal was being magnanimous. By means of such unilateral concession, Portugal intended to avoid the humiliation of Peace negotiations with its former Colony. King John VI wanted to \\"save face\\" by giving the impression that Portugal was voluntarily conceding independence to Brazil, and not just recognizing a fait accompli. Thus the Letters Patent issued on 13 May 1825 ignored the proclamation of 1822 and \\"granted independence to Brazil\\" as if it were a concession, that was laced with conditions. Thus, Brazilian independence would result not from the events of 1822, but from the 1825 Letters Patent. In the 13 May 1825 Letters Patent, King John recited the polity creating acts of his predecessors and of other sovereigns of Europe, recited his own desire to promote the happiness of all the peoples over which he ruled, and proceeded to declare and enact that from thenceforth the Kingdom of Brazil would be an Empire, and that the Empire of Brazil would be separate from the Kingdoms of Portugal and the Algarves in both internal and foreign affairs; that he, John, therefore took for himself the title of Emperor of Brazil and King of Portugal and the Algarves, to which would follow the other titles of the Portuguese Crown; that the title of \\"Prince or Princess Imperial of Brazil, and Royal of Portugal and the Algarves\\" would be vested in the heir or heiress presumptive of the imperial and royal Crowns; that since the succession of both the imperial and royal Crowns belonged to his son, \\"Prince Dom Pedro\\", he, King John, at once, \\"by this same act and letters patent\\", ceded and transferred to Pedro, from thenceforth, of his \\"own free will\\", the full sovereignty of the Empire of Brazil, for Pedro to govern it, assuming at once the title Emperor of Brazil, keeping at the same time the title of Prince Royal of Portugal and the Algarves, while John reserved for himself the same title of Emperor, and the position of King of Portugal and the Algarves, with the full sovereignty of the said Kingdoms (of Portugal and the Algarves). However, such unilateral, constitutive recognition was not accepted by Brazilians, who demanded a declarative recognition of the independence as proclaimed and existing since 1822. The new Brazilian Government therefore made the establishment of peaceful relations and diplomatic ties with Portugal conditional on the signature of a bilateral treaty between the two Nations. Portugal eventually agreed, and a treaty to that effect was signed with British mediation. The treaty between the Empire of Brazil and the Kingdom of Portugal on the recognition of Brazilian independence, signed in Rio de Janeiro on 29 August 1825, finally entered into force on 15 November 1825 upon the exchange of the instruments of ratification in Lisbon. The Portuguese, however, only accepted to sign the Independence treaty on condition that Brazil agreed to pay reparations for the properties of the Portuguese State that were seized by the new Brazilian State. Brazil desperately needed to establish normal diplomatic relations with Portugal, because other European Monarchies had already made clear that they would only recognize the Empire of Brazil after the establishment of normal relations between Brazil and Portugal. Thus, by a separate convention that was signed on the same occasion as the Treaty on the Recognition of Independence, Brazil agreed to pay Portugal two million pounds in damages. The British, who had mediated the Peace negotiations, granted Brazil a loan of the same value, so that Brazil could pay the agreed sum. The new Nation, therefore, achieved international recognition at a heavy price. As a result of this agreement, Brazil became plunged in debt to Britain, but was able to achieve universal international recognition, both de facto and de jure as an independent State. Upon recognizing the independence of Brazil from the United Kingdom of Portugal, Brazil and Algarves, King John VI, by his charter of law of 15 November 1825 changed back the name of the Portuguese State and the Royal Titles to \\"Kingdom of Portugal\\" and \\"King of Portugal and the Algarves\\" respectively. The title of the Portuguese heir apparent was changed to \\"Prince Royal of Portugal and the Algarves\\" by the same edict. The recognition of Brazilian independence completed the dissolution of the United Kingdom. By a provision of the Letters Patent of 13 May 1825, confirmed by the Treaty on the Recognition of Independence in spite of the secession of Brazil from the Portuguese Monarchy, the Portuguese King, John VI, was allowed to use for the remainder of his life the honorary title of \\"Emperor of Brazil\\", with the caveat that this title was honorary and ceremonial only, and that Pedro I and his successors in the independent Brazilian Crown were the only actual Emperors of Brazil. This honorary title ceased to have effect upon the demise of King John VI on 10 March 1826. News of the separate convention appended to the Independence Treaty, by which Brazil agreed to pay Portugal financial compensation, angered many Brazilians, who saw this payment as a result of a bad negotiation, especially in view of the Brazilian military victory in the independence war. The grant of the honorary imperial title to the Portuguese King was also not popular with Brazilians. Furthermore, the declaratory language of the Independence Treaty was sufficiently ambiguous, so that Brazilians could claim that the independence declared in 1822 was being recognized, but mention was also made of the 13 May 1825 Letters Patent, so that the Portuguese could claim that the recognition was based on the previous concession. The preamble of the treaty mentioned the concession made by means of the Letters Patent of 13 May 1825; it stated that, by that Letters Patent, the Portuguese King had \\"recognized Brazil as an independent Empire, and his son Dom Pedro as Emperor\\", but also stated that, in so doing, the Portuguese monarch was \\"ceding and transferring of his free will the sovereignty of the said Empire\\". In the treaty's second article, it was the Brazilian Emperor who agreed that his father, the Portuguese King, should take for himself the honorary life title of Emperor. In the first article of the treaty it was declared that the King of Portugal recognized Brazil as an independent Empire, and as a Nation separate from the Kingdoms of Portugal and the Algarves, and also recognized his son Dom Pedro as Emperor of Brazil, ceding \\"of his own free will\\" to the Brazilian Emperor and his legitimate successors all claims of sovereignty over Brazil. Peace was established between the countries of Brazil and Portugal by the fourth Article. In spite of the unpopular clauses, and especially of the harsh financial agreement, Brazilian Emperor Pedro I agreed to ratify the treaty negotiated with Portugal as he was keen on resolving the recognition of independence question before the opening of the first legislative session of the Brazilian Parliament (Assembl√©ia Geral or General Assembly) elected under the Constitution adopted in 1824. The first meeting of the new Legislature was set to take place on 3 May 1826, and after a brief delay, that Parliament was indeed opened on 6 May 1826. By that time, the independence question was indeed resolved, as the Independence treaty had been ratified in November 1825 and as the Emperor, still yielding the fullness of legislative authority (that he was to lose upon the first meeting of the Parliament), ordered the execution of the agreement as part of the law of Brazil on 10 April 1826. =Aftermath: resolution of the dynastic entanglement= With the death of the Portuguese King John VI on 10 March 1826, his heir apparent, Brazilian Emperor Pedro I, inherited the Portuguese Crown, and reigned briefly as King Pedro IV. On 20 March 1826 the proclamation of the Brazilian Emperor's accession to the Portuguese Throne was made public by the Portuguese Council of Regency (that had been instituted by King John VI during his final illness, and that was led by the Infanta Isabel Maria, daughter of John VI and Pedro I & IV's sister). With this union of Crowns, the monarchies of Portugal and Brazil were once again briefly united, but there was no thought of a reunification of the two separate States. Accordingly, this brief union of Crowns in the person of Pedro I and IV remained always a personal union only, and not a real union or a rebirth of the United Kingdom. News of the death of King John VI and of the proclamation of the Brazilian Emperor as King of Portugal reached the Brazilian province of Bahia on 18 April, and official news to that effect reached the Emperor of Brazil and new King of Portugal in Rio de Janeiro on 24 April 1826, shortly after the final settlement of the Brazilian independence question (the decree publishing the text of the Treaty on the Recognition of Independence and ordering its execution as part of the Law of Brazil had just been made public on 10 April 1826). The existence even of the personal union only was seen by Brazilian politicians as dangerous, since it could come to affect the effectiveness of the newly formed country's sovereignty. Accordingly, steps were taken to put an end to the personal union: Pedro I & IV agreed to abdicate the Portuguese Throne in favour of his eldest daughter, but he also wanted to ensure that her rights would be respected, and he further wanted to restore constitutional monarchy to Portugal. In order to put an end to the Portuguese absolute monarchy, the King-Emperor commissioned the drafting of a new Constitution for Portugal, that was widely based on the Brazilian Constitution. This document was finalized in less than a week. Queen Maria II (right) and his wife Am√©lie on the frontispiece of the 1826 Portuguese Constitution After issuing a new Constitution for Portugal on 29 April 1826, and as already announced in that Constitution, King-Emperor Pedro abdicated the Portuguese Crown in favour of his daughter, Princess Maria da Gl√≥ria, on 2 May 1826. Princess Maria da Gl√≥ria thus became Queen Maria II of Portugal. The document by which the Brazilian Emperor abdicated the Portuguese Crown was signed days before the first meeting of the Parliament established by the Brazilian Constitution of 1824, that assembled for the first time on 6 May 1826. Before his abdication, on 26 April, King Pedro confirmed the Regency of Portugal that had been established by his father during his final illness, and that was led by the Infanta Isabel Maria, his sister. As the new Queen Maria II was still a minor, Portugal would need to be led by Regents during her minority. On 30 April, King Pedro IV set the date for the first legislative elections under the new Portuguese Constitution and appointed Peers of the Realm. On 12 May 1826, British envoy Charles Stuart left Rio de Janeiro for Portugal carrying with him the acts signed by the Brazilian Emperor as King of Portugal, including the new Portuguese Constitution and his deed of abdication of the Portuguese Crown. On that same date Carlos Matias Pereira left Rio de Janeiro for Lisbon in another ship carrying a second copy of the same documents. Charles Stuart arrived in Lisbon on 2 July 1826 and presented the acts signed by King Pedro IV to the Government of Portugal, including his original deed of abdication of the Portuguese Throne. On 12 July 1826 the Portuguese Government published the new Constitution decreed by Pedro IV; the Portuguese Regency swore on 31 July 1826 an oath to uphold the Constitution, marking its entry into force, and, on 1 August 1826 Queen Maria II was publicly proclaimed as Queen of Portugal, with the Infanta Isabel Maria as Regent. On 4 October the exiled infante Miguel (that had been exiled since attempting to depose his father, and that would later usurp the Portuguese Crown, leading to the Portuguese Civil War of 1828‚Äì1834, took in Vienna an oath of allegiance to Queen Maria II and the Constitution). The first Portuguese Cortes to meet under the Constitution were elected on 8 October, and the opening of Parliament took place on 30 October 1826. Although Pedro's abdication of the Portuguese Crown to Maria II was provided for even in the Constitution issued on 29 April 1826, the original deed of abdication, signed on 2 May 1826 contained conditions; however, those conditions were subsequently waived, as the abdication was later declared final, irrevocable, accomplished and fully effective by a decree issued by Pedro on 3 March 1828, just a few months before Infante Miguel's usurpation of the Throne and the start of the Portuguese Civil War (in accordance with a decree issued on 3 September 1827, Infante Miguel replaced Infanta Isabel Maria as Regent of Portugal on 26 February 1828, and he initially agreed to govern in the name of the Queen, but on 7 July 1828 he had himself proclaimed King with retroactive effect, assuming the title of Miguel I; Maria II would only be restored to the Throne in 1834, at the conclusion of the Civil War). In any event, Pedro's unconditional confirmation of his abdication reinforced the impossibility of a new union between Portugal and Brazil. Pedro's abdication of the Portuguese Throne led to the separation of the Brazilian and Portuguese monarchies, since the Portuguese Crown was inherited by Queen Maria II and her successors, and the Brazilian Crown came to be inherited by Pedro I's Brazilian heir apparent, Prince Pedro de Alcantara, who would become the future Emperor Pedro II of Brazil. Prince Pedro de Alcantara had no rights to the Portuguese Crown because, having been born in Brazil on 2 December 1825, after the Portuguese recognition of the independence of Brazil, he was not a Portuguese national and under the Portuguese Constitution and Laws a foreigner could not inherit the Portuguese Crown. Still, with Princess Maria da Gl√≥ria's accession to the Throne of Portugal as Queen Maria II in 1826, the question arose, about whether she should still be regarded as a Brazilian Princess with a place in the order of succession, or whether article 119 of Brazil's Constitution (that prohibited foreigners from succeeding to the Crown) applied to her, so that, as a foreigner, she should be considered excluded from the Brazilian line of succession. The Empire's Constitution limited the Crown of Brazil to Emperor Pedro I and his legitimate descendants, under a male- preference cognatic primogeniture system, but it rendered foreigners incapable of succeeding to the Crown, and it empowered the General Assembly, the Empire's Parliament, to settle any doubts regarding the rights of succession to the Crown. The issue of Queen Maria II's status in the Brazilian line of succession became more pressing once Emperor Pedro II acceded to the Brazilian Throne as a minor in 1831, since the question was no longer only about whether or not the Queen of Portugal had a place in the Brazilian line of succession, but it had now become a question about whether or not she was the heiress presumptive to the Brazilian Crown, that is, the first person in line to succeed to the Brazilian Throne, occupied by her brother Emperor Pedro II. Thus, the Brazilian Parliament had to settle the matter and decide who was the first person in line to the Brazilian Throne, with the corresponding title of Princess Imperial: Queen Maria II of Portugal or Princess Janu√°ria of Brazil. Both were minors under Brazilian Law, and since no one in the Brazilian Imperial Family was of age, the Regency of the Empire was discharged by politicians chosen by the General Assembly in accordance with the Constitution. However, the question was all important because, in the event that Emperor Pedro II died before producing descendants, the Crown of the independent Empire of Brazil could end up coming to the Queen of Portugal, thus recreating a personal union between the two monarchies. The question became even more pressing after the conclusion of the Portuguese Civil War (1828-1834), won by Maria II and her liberal supporters in 1834: Maria's uncle, the absolutist claimant Dom Miguel (who had deposed Maria in 1828), was defeated, surrendered his claim to the Portuguese Throne in the Concession of Evoramonte, Maria was restored to the Throne and her constitutional government, now recognized by all foreign Powers as the legitimate one, assumed control of the whole of Portugal. Although the doubt about which of the two Princesses was Emperor Pedro II's heiress presumptive had existed since the abdication of the Brazilian Crown by Pedro I in 1831, Maria II was at the time a deposed Queen, although actively pursuing her claim to the Throne of Portugal. With her victory in the Portuguese Civil War, however, she once again became an actually reigning monarch, and, for the whole Brazilian political establishment, the fact that a foreign Sovereign was heiress presumptive to the Brazilian Crown was highly worrying, as it was seen as detrimental to the independence of the recently established Brazilian Nation. The Regency and Parliament of Brazil wanted to avoid any possibility of a personal union with Portugal being recreated, so as to secure the independence of Brazil. In order to settle that question, the Brazilian General Assembly adopted a statute, signed into law by the Regent on behalf of Emperor Pedro II on 30 October 1835, declaring Queen Maria II of Portugal had lost her succession rights to the Crown of Brazil, due to her condition as a foreigner, so that she and her descendants were excluded from the Brazilian line of succession; ruling that Princess Janu√°ria and her descendants were therefore first in line to the Throne after Emperor Pedro II and his descendants, and decreeing that, accordingly, Princess Janu√°ria, as the then heiress presumptive of the Brazilian Crown, should be recognized as Princess Imperial. Thus, the abdication of the Portuguese Crown by Brazilian Emperor Pedro I terminated the brief 1826 personal union and separated the monarchies of Portugal and Brazil, and that abdication, coupled with the exclusion of the new Portuguese Queen, Maria II, from the Brazilian line of succession, broke the last remaining ties of political union between the two Nations, securing the preservation of the independence of Brazil and putting to an end all hopes of the rebirth of a Luso-Brazilian United Kingdom.

It fought as part of the German Army Group B during World War II, in Ukraine, the Crimea, and the Caucasus. General Petre Dumitrescu commanded the 3rd Army for a period.  World War I  After Romania entered World War I in August 1916 on the side of the Allies, the Third Army defended the border with Bulgaria, while the rest of the Romanian Army engaged in the Battle of Transylvania. When a Bulgarian- German army under August von Mackensen invaded Romania in September 1916, the Third Army made attempts to withstand the enemy offensive at Silistra, Bazargic, Amzacea and Topraisar, but had to withdraw under the pressure of superior enemy forces after the Second Battle of Cobadin. After the FlƒÉm√¢nda Offensive, the Third Army was disbanded. The commanders of the 3rd Army during that time were : * Divisional General : 27 August 1916 ‚Äì 7 September 1916 * Divisional General Alexandru Averescu: 7 September 1916 ‚Äì 7 October 1916 Alexandru Averescu  World War II  On 22 June 1941 the 3rd Army comprised the 4th Army Corps (6th and 7th Infantry Divisions), the Cavalry Corps (5th and 8th Cavalry Brigades), the Mountain Corps (1st, 2nd, and 4th Mountain Brigades), two separate artillery battalions, a target acquisition battery, and the Air Forces's 3rd Army Cooperation Command.Leo Niehorster, Army Group Antonescu, 22 June 1941, accessed June 2011 For Operation M√ºnchen, in the north, the 3rd Army was reduced only to the Mountain Corps (the 1st, 2nd and 4th Mountain Brigades, 8th Cavalry Brigade and 7th Infantry Division), because the Cavalry Corps (5th and 6th Cavalry Brigades) had been subordinated directly to the German Eleventh Army.World War II.ro In fact the 3rd Army command did not have any operative attributes until 2 July 1941, when the ground offensive started also in the Romanian sector. In 1942 in the Battle of the Caucasus, the 3rd Army initially consisted of the Cavalry Corps (5th, 6th and 9th Cavalry Divisions) and the 1st Army Corps (2nd Mountain Division and German 298th Infantry Division). The 3rd Army was subordinated to the German 17th Army. It also had 3 observation squadrons assigned to it. However, after reorganization, on 7 August, only the Cavalry Corps remained with it. Battle of Stalingrad Along with the Romanian Fourth Army, the Third Army bore the brunt of the Soviet Operation Uranus, which saw the German Sixth Army encircled and destroyed during the Battle of Stalingrad. The Romanian Third Army, commanded by General Petre Dumitrescu, was transferred from the Caucasus and replaced five Italian and two German divisions between Blij Perekopa and Bokovkaya, with the task of defending a front 138 km long, far beyond its capabilities. To make things worse, the Soviets had two bridgeheads over the Don River, at Serafimovich and Kletskaya, which the German High Command ignored, despite repeated requests by General Dumitrescu for permission to eliminate them. At the start of the Soviet offensive in November 1942, the Third Army had a nominal strength of 152,492 Romanian troops and 11,211 German troops, being made up from 1st, 2nd, 4th and 5th Corps in a single echelon (1st Cavalry, 5th, 6th, 7th, 9th, 11th, 13th and 14th Infantry Divisions) from West to East, with 7th Cavalry and 15th Infantry Divisions in reserve. The Long Range Recon (DO-17M) and the 112th Liaison Squadrons (Fleet 10G) were also at its disposal. In November came the German XLVIII Panzer Corps, composed of the 22nd German Panzer Division and the 1st Romanian Armored Division, which also was put in reserve. It also had the 2nd, 4th, 5th, and 8th Motorized Heavy Artillery Regiments and the 41st Independent Motorized Heavy Artillery Battalion. Opposite the 3rd Army was the Southwestern Front, comprising the Soviet 1st Guards Army, 5th Tank Army and 21st Army, with a force of 5,888 artillery pieces, 728 tanks, and 790 planes. Romanian soldier in Stalingrad On 19 November at 0530, in the sector of the Third Romanian Army, a violent artillery barrage battered the entire front line. The weather conditions were harsh: blizzards, snow, -20 degrees Celsius, which made close air support impossible. The Soviets assaulted the positions of the 14th Infantry Division with the 5th Tank Army and the junction between the 13th Infantry Division and the 1st Cavalry Division with the 21st Army, with a total of 338,631 men against three weak divisions. The 37mm and 47mm AT guns were useless against Soviet T-34 tanks, so the Romanian troops had to use grenades, anti-tank mines and Molotov cocktails. In the first hours, they managed to delay the advance and destroy some tanks, but later they had to retreat or face encirclement. The Soviets also attacked west of Sarisa Valley and at Raspopinskaya, but were repulsed. In response to the situation that developed south of Kletskaya, the German 48th Panzer Corps was ordered to move towards the Soviet main thrust and shortly afterwards, the 22nd Panzer Division was redirected to the northwest towards Bolsoy and, reaching Petshany, it engaged Soviet armor. By evening, the 1st Romanian Armored Division reached Sirkovsky, making preparations to attack Bolsoy the next day. In the first day of the offensive, the Soviet forces succeeded in making two large breaches in the defences of the Third Romanian Army: one in the center, 16‚Äì18 km wide and 15 km deep and one in the right wing, between the Third Romanian Army and the German Sixth Army, 10‚Äì12 km wide and 35‚Äì40 km deep. Soviet advance at Stalingrad from 19 to 28 November 1942 On 20 November, the Soviet armored and motorized forces advanced towards Kalach, with the intention of encircling the 6th Army embroiled in ferocious fighting at Stalingrad. The 22nd Panzer Division, overwhelmed at Petshany by the large number of Soviet tanks, withdrew north to Bol. Donschynka. The Romanian 1st Armored Division, without any available radio contact, tried to advance to Petshany in order to make the junction with the 22nd Panzer Division, but was forced to stop a few kilometers west of Korotovsky by stiff Soviet resistance and numerous counterattacks by Soviet tanks, flowing between the German 22nd and the Romanian 1st, occupying the Varlamovsky and Peralasovsky villages and making the junction with forces coming from Gromsky, thus encircling the 5th Corps. In the 4th Corps' sector, 40 Soviet tanks attacked the 15th Infantry Division but were repulsed by evening with heavy losses. Meanwhile, the 7th Cavalry Division unsuccessfully tried to block the enemy's advance; the right wing of the division, which had fully received the blow, retreated south while the left wing was reassigned to the 9th Infantry Division. Also, the 1st Cavalry Division had to retreat towards Stalingrad and was subordinated to the 6th Army. At the end of the day, the defensive position of the Third Romanian Army had a 70 km wide gap in the centre. In this pocket were encircled the 1st Armored Division, three infantry divisions (5th, 6th, and 15th), and remains of other two infantry divisions (13th and 14th). The former commander of the 6th Infantry Division, Major General Mihail LascƒÉr, took command of the troops from the infantry divisions and formed the \\"General LascƒÉr\\" Group (40,000 men). At this point, the command point of the Third Army began moving to Morozovskaya. On 21 November, the 22nd Panzer Division tried to advance towards Perelasovsky in order to make the junction with the 1st Armored Division and to relieve the \\"General LascƒÉr\\" Group, but failed and was stopped the next day between Bol. Donschynka and Perelasovky. The 1st Romanian Armored Division advanced towards Bol. Donschynka, where it was hoping to find the German division, but the village was under Soviet control and then headed south and, after grim fighting, crossed the Chir River on 25 November. On 22 November, the encircled \\"General LascƒÉr\\" Group, which had been ordered to resist at any cost, was attacked and transmitted its last message. They had run out of food and each gun had only 40 rounds left and after refusing the Soviet proposal to surrender they were entirely destroyed. Only the 1st Battalion of the 15 Infantry Regiment (6th infantry Division), commanded by Major Gheorghe Rasconescu, succeeded in getting to the Chir River with all its soldiers and equipment. His battalion had managed to prevent the Soviet 8th Cavalry Division from capturing the vital German airfield at Oblivkaya from 26 November to 3 December. On 23 November, the Soviet troops of the South-Western Front and of the Stalingrad Front met at Kalach-na-Donu, completing the encirclement of the German 6th Army, parts of the Romanian 4th Army, and six other Romanian infantry divisions as well as one cavalry division.

As a countermeasure to suppress the drug trade using Venezuela, the Venezuelan government routinely sends gunships to patrol the waters between Trinidad and Tobago and Venezuela. Cedros is a key area in that fight. Counter-measures by the Government of Trinidad and Tobago in Cedros include a jetty for quickly launching boats for drug interdiction. Geography Cedros is considered to be one of the final remaining areas that millions of years ago attached the island of Trinidad geologically to the South American continent. Cedros is said to still share resemblance to the adjacent Venezuelan coastline 11‚Äì12 km across the passage of water known as Boca del Sierpe (Serpent's Mouth).

According to an image published by a local photographer in 2007, when the tide was out or low, there was a large stretch of beach which appeared to be excellent for walking. The sand was a light beige and there were coconut trees on the shore of the bay. On weekends and on log weekends persons tend to drive down to coastal areas either to bathe in the sea or purchase fish for consumption or to enjoy the scenery pr to participate in hikes and other nature events. Hikes Hikes are conducted over various geographical terrain and at different times in the year. One of the hikes which is offered to the public by a public hiking group, for which a fee is paid is from Cedros to Icacos. Cedros Recreation Ground According to the Laws of Trinidad and Tobago Chapter 41:01 \\"Recreation Grounds and Pastures\\" in the First Schedule, in the county of St. Patrick, there is a \\"Granville Recreation Ground, (Granville Village, Ward of Cedros)\\"FAOLEX.FAO.Org.http://faolex.fao.org/docs/pdf/tri106219.pdf This may be the main Recreation Ground of Cedros.  Cedros Public Cemetery Cedros Public Cemetery has simple and elaborate tombs and grave spots. On some of the grave spots, the boundaries of which are marked off by bricks, there is indication of recent maintenance in the white paint. However there are one or two which have an elaborate gravestone, along with information which has been carved into the tombstone as per the image in Angelo Bissessarsingh's photo of a tombstone in 2009 (See the Link to the citation).Flickr Photo Angelo Bissessarsingh https://www.flickr.com/photos/39646565@N05/3682839830 It is the practice of holders of grave spots in cemeteries to bury their close relatives one on top of the other with a few feet of dirt between each person after a number of years have passed. Some grave holders rent spots in different parts of the cemetery either as the spaces become available or as the family grows and the spots are used or as the finances of the family changes, which ever comes first. Given the terrain of most areas, it is practical to select spots in different locations to take account of expansion of the cemetery and or the wishes of parents with respect to burial.

However it is my opinion (Jennifer Bailey's) that given the current price of oil worldwide at 2016, the cost of extraction may involve considerable cash outflows which may not be recovered from the sale of oil in the near future, hence the cash outflows in certain companies may exceed the inflows at a point in time. Given the strategic importance of the extraction of oil, one may examine the needs of the shareholders in companies and their reserves now and over time. There are also shallow oil fields which are located in Cedros according to information provided by the Trinidad Express in 2015.Trinidad Express http://www.trinidadexpress.com/20150721/business/what 8217s-in-cedros-200-million-barrels-of-oil Cedros Public Library The Cedros Public Library is located in the Cedros Composite School according to the NALIS website.

Also available from most NALIS Public Libraries are DVDs with movies which cater to the needs of children and adults. Smelter In 2005‚Äì06, the Government of Trinidad and Tobago led by the then Prime Minister of T&T; ‚Äì Patrick Manning announced an initiative to rapidly industrialise the Cedros area. One of the projects devised for Cedros was the establishment of an Alumina smelter plant which was backed by ALCOA. Residents living in the Cedros area opposed the project. The plant was touted as becoming one of the biggest alumina smelter plants in the world once completed; however, residents in Cedros claimed that ash from the plant could contaminate the local area's soil and may lead to possible respiratory-health issues in the long run. The Smelter project was cancelled in September 2010.

Johann von Armssheim, 1483. Woodcut The Disputation of Tortosa was one of the famous ordered disputations between Christians and Jews of the Middle Ages, held in the years 1413‚Äì1414 in the city of Tortosa, Catalonia, Crown of Aragon (part of modern-day Spain). According to the Jewish Encyclopedia it was not a free and authentic debate, but was an attempt by Christians to force conversion on the Jews. Among the participants on the Jewish side were Profiat Duran and Yosef Albo as well as other rabbinic scholars such as Moshe ben Abbas, and Astruc ha-Levi. Each one was a representative of a different community. Vincent Ferrer, later canonised, was an important participant on the Christian side. As a followup of the disputations, in May 1415, a papal bull forbade the study of the Talmud and inflicted all kinds of degradation upon the Jews.Gr√§tz, l.c. viii. 116, 406 Background The initiator of the disputation and representative for the Christians was the antipope's personal physician, the Jewish Christian convert Ger√≥nimo de Santa Fe. After his conversion to Christianity, he presented Antipope Benedict XIII with a composition containing topics to contest with his former co-religionists. The aging antipope, who rejoiced at religious debate, jumped at the opportunity to bring the Jews to a disputation. King Ferdinand I of Aragon did not stand in his way, and letters of invitation were sent to the various Jewish communities in 1413. Attempts by the Jews to free themselves of this were not successful. The Jewish representatives were at a considerable disadvantage‚Äîwhere Nahmanides at the Disputation of Barcelona and the Jewish representatives at the Disputation of Paris had been granted immunity, \\"every Jewish attempt to respond to the Christian charges was met with the threat of the accusation of heresy\\".Madeleine Pelner Cosman and Linda Gale Jones (2008). Handbook of Life in the Medieval World. Infobase Publishing. The disputation was not a free discussion between two parties but took the form of a propaganda attack by the Christian side against Jews, including the use of psychological pressure in the form of intimidation and threats. Proceedings=Beginnings At the start of the disputation on February 7, 1413, Geronimo presented the debate's principal points and the prohibition incumbent on the Jews from making any difficulties for Christianity over its course. By his words, since the Jewish faith is close to the Christian faith and since the Pope considers the Jews \\"lost lambs\\", he is eager to return them to Good more than he is eager to do so with the believers in Islam. The main speaker among the Jewish sages was chosen by turn each day. They were placed under great stress, and at times when they returned to the residence allotted to them arguments erupted over the answers they had provided. Their opponent was always granted the last word. Geronimo emphasized the Midrashic passages according to which the Messiah had already come. These include the passage which identifies the birthday of the Messiah as the day of the destruction of the Second Temple and the statement in the Talmud that the world will last 6000 years, of which the last two thousand would be the Messianic Age. He also used the midrash of the Pesikta which says that the Messiah will suffer. The Jews responded via a commentary to the midrashim that relied on both the surface (peshat) and comparative meaning (drash) to remove the messianic sting. They also repeated the statement of Nahmanides in his own disputation that he is not obligated to believe in Aggadah, which led Geronimo to depict them as heretics by their own religion. The Jews also pointed out that, in any case, belief in the Messiah is not the mainstay of Judaism. This point was to appear in an explicit and expanded form in the Sefer ha-Ikkarim (\\"Book of Fundamental Principles\\"), which Yosef Albo wrote following the disputation. Geronimo also utilized the midrashim published by Ram√≥n Mart√≠ in his book Pugio Fidei. The Jews claimed these to be fraudulent forgeries and demanded that the original Jewish manuscript in which the midrashim appear be brought before them, but the demand was not granted. The question of whether the midrashim offered by Mart√≠ were indeed forgeries has been a controversial one among scholars. After two weeks of discussion, the head of the Dominican Order summed up, saying that the victory of the Christians is clear and that it was proven with certainty by the Jews' own midrashim that the Messiah has already come. There were thus two possibilities: either the Jewish representatives did not have all their say, or that they are without answer. The Pope summed up and said that since the Jews change their words from one moment to another it would be better to hold the disputation in writing. Thus the disputation continued by way of readings of written memoranda through the months of March and April. The Jews requested a free debate, but they were told that they are not at a debate but at a gathering for indoctrination and inculcation. When they said that a teacher should consider the wishes of the student, they were told that there is no interest in indoctrinating them, only the Jewish masses. As a way of undervaluing themselves, the sages said that mistakes and errors might befall them, but the Law of Moses is forever. Geronimo insisted on using again and again the midrashim from the Dagger of Faith and to abstain when asked to show the manuscript in which they appear. Second phase From May onward the discussion focused on the things the Messiah is supposed to accomplish. The Jews claimed that he is to take the Nation of Israel out of the diaspora and to rebuild the Temple in Jerusalem - things Jesus did not do. The Jews' main points were: the Diaspora still exists, even Christianity has not spread everywhere, the nations fight one another, there is no world peace, and people continue to sin. In any case, the Redemption of Israel must be the redemption of the Jews, and that has certainly not occurred. The gentiles cannot be called \\"Israel\\" (as opposed to the Church's position). The Christians forcefully argued that in the midrashim themselves it may be seen that the redemption brought by the Messiah is spiritual, that is, it is atonement for Man and the extrication of the souls from Hell. The Jews responded that for the redemption of souls there is no need for a messiah: observers of mitzvot in every generation achieve salvation in the afterlife without a messiah. A topic discussed in the disputation is the future abolition of the sacrifices. Geronimo claimed, using among other sources the famous pronouncement of Maimonides, that sacrifices are a psychological substitute for paganism and that sacrifices will eventually be abolished. The Jews maintained that sacrifices will persist in the Messianic Age, and that besides the rational explanations for them there are also mystical ones. The Jewish religious leaders fiercely rejected the claim that their refusal to accept the religion of Jesus is the reason for the lengthening of the Exile, for if they had accepted the Islamic religion and turned to such nations as the Ottomans, they would also have been freed from bondage. Third phase Between August and November there was a recess in the discussions, and a new series of meetings opened in actuality only on January 8, 1414. Only three of the Jewish leaders agreed to continue. Rabbi Yosef Albo asked to return home, yet in the end remained in the city. The Jews declared that the Christians were making strange use of the midrashim. Even by their reasoning, according to which the midrashim indicate that the Messiah has already come, they certainly do not indicate that he came in the time of Jesus. If so, how can they be used to prove the truthfulness of Christianity? The Christians responded that they indeed are not obligated to believe in the midrashim, but the Jews, who do believe in them, must conclude from them that the Messiah was already born. The Jews again explained why they thought there was no logic in this claim. As the discussions on the doctrine of the Messiah continued, Astruc HaLevi emphasized that the word \\"messiah\\" in its Jewish and Christian meanings is completely different. Thus, he said, there is no difference of opinion between Jews and Christians over the question of his coming, rather the debate is over what a messiah really is. Afterwards, he nullified the significance of the debate. A failure in the debate cannot prove the failure of the faith, but only the inabilities of the arguer. The Jewish religious leaders are far from their homes and are losing their properties because of this, and their families are being harmed. Their situation is so degraded that no great wisdom is needed to debate them in these conditions. Geronimo responded that their scared and frightened demeanors in themselves prove that their belief is not true, for on the true faith it is said in the Bible: \\"I will also speak of Thy testimonies before kings, and will not be ashamed\\" (Ps. 119:46). The disputation over faith is necessary, and the Jewish leaders must give an accounting for the Torah, which they teach. Zerachia HaLevi then emphasized that the belief in the Messiah is a principle of faith by which the midrashim must be interpreted. Thus he rejected the attempt to produce arguments against the principle of the Messiah from the midrash, for the interpretation must use the principle of faith to elucidate the midrash, not the reverse. In April, Geronimo summarized the disputation according to his own understanding, and thus ended the exchange over the matter of the Messiah. Debate over the Talmud Discussion turned to a new topic, around which revolved the earlier Disputation of Paris of 1240: \\"the errors, heresies, defilements, and blasphemies against the Christian religion\\" found in the Talmud. At this point, the Jews apparently decided that it is better for them to keep quiet, and said that although they are convinced that the sages of the Talmud would know how to defend their words, they do not know how to do so. Yosef Albo and Zerachia HaLevi did not participate in this communication and agreed to respond, but their responses are not known. Geronimo demanded to burn the Talmud. He used the dispute over the works of Maimonides, which ended with the burning of his books, to justify burning a book even if only a small part of it is heretical. It seems that most of the Jewish religious leaders reached the conclusion that a continuation of the disputation would exact a heavy cost and that the harm brought in their absence upon their communities and families was intolerable, so they decided to end it at all costs. It is not known what those among them who decided to continue said in the remainder, and in December 1414 the disputation was formally concluded. Results Benedict claimed victory and he gave instructions by which all books of the Talmud would be handed over to his functionaries for censorship. Compulsory conversions of the Jews continued, although they were not given official encouragement. However, Jews who were coerced into becoming Christian could, if they wished, return to their own religion. Vincent Ferrer passed through the communities and compelled the Jews to hear his sermons, then took his campaign north to France in 1416; that year a new king, Alfonso V, took to the throne in Aragon, and subsequently reversed all the anti-Jewish legislation of the Ferrer epoch, protecting the Jews and conversos firmly from the start of his reign and rejecting all attacks on them.Kamen, p. 14. Most of the damage caused as a result of the disputation was to morale. Aragon Jewry suffered a hard blow and many of its dignitaries and wealthy converted. The feeling was that the Jews had gotten the worst of it in the confrontation with Geronimo. After the fact, Isaac Abrabanel criticized the weakness of the arguments brought forward by the Jewish religious leaders,Albo, Joseph, His Peculiar Terminology. Jewish Encyclopedia. 1906. 24 August 2014 [last update] but it appears that under their duress, their ability to succeed was more limited.

The game's plot centers on investigating the sudden disappearance of planet Earth, by venturing out into the universe from a moon base. There are two main play modes: real-time exploration and combat using various spacecraft, and turn- based exploration, problem solving, and combat on the surface of dozens of planets. The game features a variety of objects, weapons, and missions, though it lacks any detailed experience or stats system for the four characters the player controls.  Plot  Just prior to the start of the game, a mysterious alien spaceship approaches the Earth to conduct an experiment which goes terribly wrong and causes the Earth to disappear into a wormhole trap. A scientific research team based on the Moon determines that the only way to bring the Earth and all its inhabitants back involves recreating this failed experiment. Unfortunately, the experimental apparatus, called the Centauri Drive, has been destroyed in this accident. Nonetheless, Moonbase scientists are able to salvage enough technology from the wrecked alien craft to construct their own rudimentary spaceship. A four-member scientific team commanded by the player is put together to find and obtain the parts necessary to rebuild the Centauri Drive and thereby save the Earth. This is the primary goal of the game. The story begins in our solar system, but the fictional setting encompasses over a hundred stars and their associated planets and civilizations in the surrounding galaxy. The game world divides the interstellar space surrounding the Sun into eight sectors characterized by particular alien civilizations possessing varying degrees of technological sophistication. Each of the eight sectors is associated with a particular subplot which must be solved in order to gain access to each of the eight pieces necessary to complete the construction of the Centauri Drive.  Gameplay  The game begins on Moonbase with the player in command of a spaceship crewed by a four-member scientific team. Here the player has the options of allocating available resources to the construction of new spaceships, weapons or other items, or of cloning crew members. Cloning randomly changes the statistical values assigned to the attributes and skills of the four team members commanded by the player; it does not change their identities. These statistics remain constant throughout the game unless the team members are subsequently re-cloned. Once a spaceship has been outfitted and launched, the player controls it in real-time from an overhead, third- person, perspective by issuing commands to team members selected from a menu. The ship can travel from one solar system to another and can be maneuvered into orbit around various planets. Some planets have useful resources which can be mined from orbit or locations to which the four member team can beam down. Along the way, other alien spaceships may be encountered. Some offer opportunities for trade or obtaining information, but others have piratical or hostile intentions. If combat ensues, it is resolved in an action sequence similar to that found in Starflight or Star Control in which the player must either destroy the attacking vessels or attempt to outrun them and flee. When a planet with a suitable beam-down location is encountered, the four person scientific team may beam down and explore it. The player controls the team members from an overhead isometric view similar to that used in a number of other role-playing video games including Ultima VI. Movement, interaction with objects and non-player characters, and ground combat are all turn-based. Commands are issued to team members via a selection of clickable icons displayed on the screen or hotkeys. An important aspect of gameplay involves mining planets for resources and acquiring new technology for the purpose of constructing more powerful ships, weapons and armor. These items allow the player to venture successfully into the more technologically advanced sectors and obtain all parts necessary to complete the construction of the Centauri Device.  Development  This game evolved from an effort to develop a computer adaptation of Star Fleet Battles. Following Neal Hallford's work on Tunnels & Trolls: Crusaders of Khazan, he was promoted to designer by New World Computing founder Jon Van Caneghem and was tasked with beginning development on both Planet's Edge and Might and Magic III: Isles of Terra. However, Ron Bolinger was later brought in to complete the design of Might and Magic III so that Hallford could focus his efforts on Planet's Edge's story, dialogue and game maps.  Reception  In the July 1992 issue of Computer Gaming World, reviewer Chris Lombardi referred to Planet's Edge as a \\"solid, charming game with a few lumps in the dough\\". He commended its \\"rich story, good play balance and many hours of game play\\", but also drew attention to a few bugs in the game mechanics and shortcomings in the game's graphics and user interface. In another review published in PC Magazine, Barry Brenesal is generally positive about the game, but considers its \\"single weak element\\" to be its handling of ground character movement. On planetary excursions, team members often become separated when the party is traveling through doors or corridors with multiple paths. Reviewer Scott A. May, writing for Compute!, declared the game to be a \\"minor masterpiece of size, imagination, and diversity of play\\" marred by a \\"few rough spots\\" including \\"a clumsy, limited character interface\\" for controlling team members during planetary exploration. The game was also reviewed in 1992 in Dragon #182 by Hartley, Patricia, and Kirk Lesser in \\"The Role of Computers\\" column. The reviewers gave the game 4 out of 5 stars. It was nominated in November 1992 for Computer Gaming World's role-playing game of the year award because it \\"reveals new creativity in the types of worlds to be explored and puzzles to be solved.\\"  References  External links  * *Planet's Edge fansite Category:1992 video games Category:DOS games Category:FM Towns games Category:NEC PC-9801 games Category:New World Computing games Category:Role-playing video games Category:Science fiction video games Category:Video games developed in the United States Category:Video games scored by George Sanger ","title":"Planet's Edge"},{"id":"4160372","text":"The Workplace Relations Act 1996 was a law regarding workplace conditions and rights passed by the Howard Government after it came into power in 1996.

She moved to the fledgling Sky News in 1988. Among her assignments, she was part of the team that covered the death of Diana, Princess of Wales on Sky, breaking the news of the princess's death shortly after 5am on Sunday 31 August 1997, she also broke the news of the September 11 attacks shortly after the first tower had been hit and fronted Sky News coverage from Sri Lanka following the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and subsequent tsunami.

On 3 October 2019, Burley hosted her final afternoon show on the channel ahead of the first morning slot on 14 October 2019. Controversies=2001 Reporting as part of Sky News's coverage of the September 11 attacks in Manhattan, Burley claimed that \\"the entire eastern seaboard of the United States has been decimated by a terrorist attack\\". 2008‚Äì09 In a 2008 interview with the former girlfriend of serial killer Steve Wright, Burley was criticised for asking her whether, if the couple had enjoyed a better sex life, he would not have committed the crimes. Images from 2008 show Burley appearing to strangle photographer Kirsty Wigglesworth outside the Naomi Campbell hearing, which a Sky News spokesperson explained by saying \\"Kay Burley was provoked by a hard hit to the face with a camera.\\" 2010‚Äì11 In February 2010, Burley apologised to guest Peter Andre who \\"fought back tears\\" after she aired comments by Dwight Yorke who criticised Andre after he volunteered to adopt Katie Price's first child (and Yorke's son) Harvey. Burley wrote in her online blog that Andre consequently \\"sobbed on my shoulder\\". During the 2010 general election, Burley's interview with electoral campaigner David Babbs from 38 Degrees was criticised for \\"bias and aggressive behaviour\\". Burley said, in part: Ofcom rejected any complaints over Sky News coverage of the event, despite receiving 2,800 complaints. Burley was subsequently heckled by protestors while reporting from College Green, who continuously chanted \\"sack Kay Burley\\", prompting Burley to say \\"Lots of demonstrators shouting 'fair votes now' ‚Äì not sure what they mean by that\\" and \\"They don't like The Sun, they don't like us, they don't like Rupert\\". In September 2010, commenting on the News International phone hacking scandal, part of an exchange between Labour MP Chris Bryant and Burley went viral, whereby Burley asks Bryant to cite information claiming that phone hacking was \\"endemic\\" in other newspapers. Bryant did, accusing Burley of being \\"a bit dim\\" and saying: Burley also falsely claimed that if he had changed his PIN, Bryant would not have been hacked. Bryant responded in an article for The Independent, saying that \\"My PIN had nothing to do with my phone being hacked. Someone phoned Orange, my mobile network provider, and tried to pretend to be me in order to gain access to my voicemails\\". Bryant has since asked on air for Burley to apologise about the interview. 2012‚Äì2015 On 5 October 2012, Burley was accused of insensitivity after she broke the news of the probable death of missing five-year-old April Jones live on air to volunteers who had been assisting in the search for her. The interviewees were unaware that the case had become a murder inquiry. 2015‚Äìpresent During the 2015 general election, Channel 4 and Ofcom received more than 400 complaints against bias in their treatment against Labour leader Ed Miliband in favour of Conservative leader and Prime Minister David Cameron, including a \\"town hall\\" part of the programme which Burley moderated. Burley repeatedly questioned Ed Miliband about his relationship with his brother David, at one point telling him: \\"Your poor mother\\". In June 2015, Burley was criticised through social media for her interview of Nick Varney, the chief executive of Merlin Entertainments. This followed an accident on The Smiler ride at Alton Towers, which led to injuries for 11 of the 16 passengers. Responses to her behaviour dubbed it \\"disrespectful to everyone involved\\" and an \\"outright attack\\". In response, Burley tweeted \\"For those concerned I was hard on Alton Towers boss, he'll get over it. Not sure those on his ride will be so quick to recover\\". Her interview with Varney began a negative reaction over social media, prompting 1,816 complaints to Ofcom and also led to over 55,000 signatures on a petition to have Burley sacked. Ofcom declined to launch a formal investigation into the interview. In March 2015, Burley repeatedly asked Cerie Bullivant of CAGE how he felt about the beheading of Western hostages by the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant. When Bullivant left the interview as he believed Burley's question to be \\"inherently Islamophobic and racist\\", Burley retorted that it was \\"nonsense\\", and told Bullivant to \\"get over yourself\\". This prompted 57 complaints to Ofcom, but no action against Burley was taken. Burley caused further controversy when, in response to the November 2015 Paris attacks, she tweeted a photograph of a golden retriever dog, to which she had added, \\"Sadness in his eyes #parisattacks\\". In 2018, during an interview concerning Boris Johnson's remarks about the burqa, Burley drew criticism when she used as an example the lack of visible facial expression of war hero Simon Weston, who had received severe facial injuries in the Falklands War. In a 2020 interview with Labour MP Diane Abbott, Burley incorrectly claimed that \\"Norway‚Äôs not in the single market and yet they have free movement.\\" However, Norway is in the European Single Market, which is why it has freedom of movement within the market. Writing Burley's first novel, First Ladies, was published on 12 May 2011. The book is an erotic romance set in the media industry, including television news.Kay Burley delivers literary lesson in romance guardian.co.uk, 28 March 2011 One reviewer called it a \\"turgid mess\\" which is not even bad enough to be good: \\"Unfortunately, this book, with its dire comic timing, complete absence of irony, pointless digressions, dull plotting and complete lack of any engaging characters, is so mind-numblingly, fist-chewingly awful, that it‚Äôs just bad.\\" Another Burley novel, Betrayal, was published in May 2012.

He was born in Fairmont, Minnesota, the son of Doris Geraldine and Lee Wilford Willson. Willson has played numerous guest characters on a variety of shows including Laverne & Shirley as Eraserhead in episode \\"A Date with Eraserhead\\", and Full House as Stu in episode \\"Crimes and Michelle's Demeanor\\" in 1990, Curb Your Enthusiasm, Boston Public, Caroline in the City, The Newsroom and Star Trek: Voyager. He is perhaps most famous for his repeated guest character of \\"Paul Krapence\\" on the television show Cheers (which he also reprised in an episode of the Cheers spin-off, Frasier). His character was originally called \\"Gregg\\" because Paul Vaughn was already playing a character named \\"Paul\\" on Cheers. For five years (1986-1990) he was Garry Shandling's neighbor \\"Leonard Smith\\" on It's Garry Shandling's Show. Willson also appeared on Garry Shandling's The Larry Sanders Show playing Larry's accountant, and the brother of Sid the cue card holder. He played Ed, a neighbor, in a few episodes of Malcolm in the Middle. His film appearances include The Pack (1977), The Devonsville Terror (1983), My Best Friend Is a Vampire (1987), Moving (1988), 976-EVIL (1988), Problem Child 2 (1991), Circuitry Man (1990), Plughead Rewired: Circuitry Man II (1994) and the comedy film Office Space (1999) as one of \\"The Bobs\\". Willson also appeared on the CBS sitcoms The King of Queens and The Big Bang Theory. Although primarily recognized for his television work, he has been noted as a \\"great improv player\\" by Garry Shandling as a result of their time working together doing improv in the late 1970s.DVD commentary from It's Garry Shandling's Show, season 2, episode 18, \\"No Baby, No Show\\" Cheers producer Ken Levine has also acknowledged Willson as \\"one of the greatest improv artists I have EVER seen.\\" Since 2012 he has appeared in television ads for Safeco Insurance.

It exists (as of 2015) as a partnership between TC Energy (31.6%), BPC Generation Infrastructure Trust (61.4%), the Power Workers Union (4%) and The Society of United Professionals (1.2%).From Bruce Power Web Site - Canadian-based consortium officially joins Bruce Power Limited Partnership It is the licensed operator of the Bruce Nuclear Generating Station, located on the shores of Lake Huron, roughly 250 kilometres northwest of Toronto, between the towns of Kincardine and Saugeen Shores. This is the largest operating nuclear plant in the world by output (Kashiwazaki is currently closed in Japan). Bruce Power operates eight nuclear reactors on Lake Huron where it leases the Bruce site from Ontario Power Generation. With those eight units in operation, the facility has a capacity of 6,400 megawatts and typically supplies nearly 30 per cent of the electricity used in Ontario's provincial power grid. Bruce Power became the world's largest operating nuclear facility in 2012, when Units 1 and 2 returned to operation after a multibillion-dollar refurbishment project. This achievement returned the site to full operating capacity for the first time in 17 years. According to the Company, \\"Bruce Power set a site record for production in 2015, generating 30 per cent of Ontario's electricity at 30 per cent less than the average residential price of power. Current and planned projects Bruce Power has invested more than $7 billion in its Bruce A and B facilities to restart and optimize the performance of its nuclear fleet over the last decade and has successfully carried out massive refurbishment and plant life extension projects on all of its operational units. It plans to refurbish Units 3-8 in a $13 billion project, beginning in 2020. Bruce A Restart Following the initial Bruce A Restart project (initiated during the British Energy incumbency) to return to service of Units 3 and 4 (completed in 2003/04), Units 1 and 2 underwent a multibillion-dollar refurbishment after years of dormancy. To facilitate this, on Oct. 17, 2005, Bruce Power announced a revision to its structure. ::TransCanada Corporation, BPC Generation Infrastructure Trust, the PWU and the Society formed a new partnership, Bruce Power A Limited Partnership (BALP), that will obtain a sublease of the Bruce A facility. Cameco Corporation is not an investor in BALP. TransCanada and BPC will each own a 47.4% interest in BALP and the remaining interest will be owned by the PWU and Society. During its peak, the Bruce A Restart project was named the largest infrastructure project in Canada, and it was widely considered as one of the most complex engineering challenges Ontario has ever seen. Safety was also a key component of the Restart initiative for both Bruce Power and its contractors. The project marked an astounding 24 million hours worked without a single acute lost-time injury. For a project this significant, this was a remarkable landmark for the entire industry. In October 2012, Bruce Power returned Units 1 and 2 to commercial operation just weeks after synchronizing to Ontario's electricity grid for the first time since 1997 and 1995 respectively. On 3 December 2015, Bruce Power president/CEO Duncan Hawthorne announced that it would spend $13 billion for a major overhaul of six of its Lake Huron reactors, starting in 2020. This is a postponement of a project initially planned for 2016; the change was made because the reactors should not require major work as soon as 2016. Bruce Power will assume any risk of financial overruns. The Ontario government was pleased with that news because the province would not be assuming any financial risk. However, the agreement will require Ontario to pay a higher price for electricity produced by Bruce Power. Naturally, the massive project will provide other benefits. \\"The agreement makes 23,000 jobs possible and supports an estimated $6.3 billion in annual, local economic development,\\" said Energy Minister Bob Chiarelli. Bruce Power Alberta In 2008, Bruce Power applied for a license to build a nuclear power plant at Cardinal Lake. Chief Executive Officer Duncan Hawthorne travelled to Peace River, Manning and Grimshaw, Alberta to personally inform the communities that Bruce Power had initiated a process to consider building western Canada's first nuclear power plant. Through an application filed with the Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission, Bruce Power sought approval to prepare a site that could generate 4,000 MW of electricity from two to four reactors that would not produce greenhouse gases or air pollutants. As concerns over climate change continue to grow, the proposal could have seen the first unit ready as early as 2017, pending the successful completion of a full Environmental Assessment (EA) and consultations with the local communities. As part of the decision-making process, open houses, workshops and community meetings were held and regular newsletters issued to update residents and seek their input across Alberta. Late in 2011, Bruce Power announced it had decided against advancing the proposal. History Bruce A Turbine Hall during the 2002‚Äì04 restart project Bruce Power was founded as a Limited Liability Partnership in 2001 between British Energy (82.4%), Cameco Corporation (15%), Power Workers' Union and The Society of Energy Professionals. Following the financial difficulties of British Energy in the Fall of 2002, the LLP became a wholly Canadian-owned Limited Partnership on Feb. 14, 2003 In May 2001, Bruce Power became the licensed operator of the Bruce Nuclear Generating Station in Tiverton, Ontario. The concession for operating the station was granted by Ontario Power Generation, one of the five successor companies of the defunct Ontario Hydro. Bruce A and Bruce B are equipped with eight CANDU nuclear reactors (four at each station). The initial four reactors were commissioned at Bruce A between 1977 and 1979, while Bruce B's were added between 1984 and 1987. The Bruce Power site at Tiverton is the world's largest nuclear generating facility. Since its creation, Bruce Power has successfully restarted all four Bruce A reactors. On Oct. 7, 2003, Unit 4 returned to the Ontario grid for the first time since 1998, when it was laid up by the site's previous operators. It was then followed by Unit 3 on Jan. 8, 2004. On Oct. 17, 2005, Bruce Power reached an agreement with the Ontario Power Authority and launched a $4.25 billion investment program to refurbish and restart Bruce A Units 1 and 2. Unit 1 was returned to the grid on Sept. 20, 2012, with Unit 2 following shortly thereafter on Oct. 18, 2012. Restarting those units boosts Bruce Power's output to 6,300 MW, making Bruce Power the source for about 25 per cent of Ontario's electricity on a typical day. In 2014, Cameco announced it had agreed to sell its 32% shareholding in Bruce Power to BPC Generation Infrastructure Trust (Borealis Infrastructure) for $450 million. Upon completion of the sale, Borealis will become the majority partner of Bruce Power with 56.1 per cent ownership. In 2016, Bruce Power started a $13 billion refurbishment program at the Bruce Nuclear Generating Station. According to Bruce Power, this multi-year plan \\"will generate between 1,500 and 2,500 jobs on site annually ‚Äì and 18,000 across Ontario directly and indirectly ‚Äì while injecting up to $4 billion annually into Ontario's economy\\".

The switch may be used to control a pump, as an indicator, an alarm, or to control other devices. One type of float switch uses a mercury switch inside a hinged float. Another common type is a float that raises a rod to actuate a microswitch. One pattern uses a reed switch mounted in a tube; a float, containing a magnet, surrounds the tube and is guided by it. When the float raises the magnet to the reed switch, it closes. Several reeds can be mounted in the tube for different level indications by one assembly. Bela G.

Float switches are often adjustable and can include substantial hysteresis. That is, the switch's \\"turn on\\" point may be much higher than the \\"shut off\\" point. This minimizes the on-off cycling of the associated pump.Stephen Herman, Understanding Motor Controls, Nelson Education, 2012, , pp. 163-165 Some float switches contain a two-stage switch. As liquid rises to the trigger point of the first stage, the associated pump is activated. If the liquid continues to rise (perhaps because the pump has failed or its discharge is blocked), the second stage will be triggered. This stage may switch off the source of the liquid being pumped, trigger an alarm, or both. A sump pump with a float switch. Where level must be sensed inside a pressurized vessel, often a magnet is used to couple the motion of the float to a switch located outside the pressurized volume. In some cases, a rod through a stuffing box can be used to operate a switch, but this creates high drag and has a potential for leakage. Successful float switch installations minimize the opportunity for accumulation of dirt on the float that would impede its motion. Float switch materials are selected to resist the deleterious effects of corrosive process liquids. In some systems, a properly selected and sized float can be used to sense the interface level between two liquids of different density.

In the Court of Appeals (Lagmannsrett), ten jurors determined the issue of guilt where a penalty of six years or more could be imposed. In complicated and lengthy cases, the number of jurors could be increased to eleven or twelve in case a juror is unable complete the trial. If there were more than ten jurors after the closing arguments, the number was reduced to ten by dismissing jurors by lot. The jury verdict was not final, and the three professional judges could set aside both convictions and acquittals for a retrial in a court of appeal. Retrials would have three professional judges and four lay judges instead of a jury. Jurors were selected from the lay judge roster for that court of appeal. The municipalities were responsible for assigning people to the roster. The last case tried before a jury in Norway was the case against Eirik Jensen.

Birth and spiritual re- birth Enoch was born on March 10, 1767 or 1768 (his family records were destroyed by accident) in Lancaster County, Virginia. As a young person he was under the ministry of the Rev. Devereux Jarratt, a Priest of the Church of England, who was one of the most earnest and effective preachers of his time. Enoch was the subject of deep religious impressions early in life. However, his father moved his family to a place where there happened to be no evangelical clergy, such that Enoch became negligent of his religious duties, neglecting the Christian ordinances altogether. After several years, his neighborhood was visited by a Methodist Circuit Rider John Easter, under whose exhortations young Enoch became connected with the little Methodist society established thereby, and again experienced the comforts of religion. Ordained ministry Indeed, Enoch was soon called upon to the exercise of public prayer and exhortation. He soon thereafter entered the field of labor as a Preacher, though with great diffidence. The Rev. George was sent by Bishop Francis Asbury to assist in forming a circuit on the headwaters of the Catawba and Broad rivers, in North Carolina. The difficulties were so great there that Enoch wrote Bishop Asbury asking for a transfer to some other field. The good bishop replied that \\"it was better for him to become inured to hardships while he was young, that when he was old and gray-headed his task would be easy.\\" In 1790 the Rev. Enoch George was admitted on trial by the Virginia Annual Conference of the M.E. Church. He was ordained, both Deacon and Elder, by Bishop Asbury. Rev. George served for two years as the Junior Preacher on the Caswell Circuit. He then went to South Carolina, where in 1796 he was appointed Presiding Elder of the Charleston District. In 1798, because of impaired health, he temporarily retired from the active work of ministry and traveled to the North. But in 1800 he resumed his labors, and was appointed Presiding Elder of the Potomac District in the Baltimore Annual Conference. The Rev. George's health failed a second time, and he located. But again, in 1803, he resumed the work this time with great zeal and success. He was stationed, successively, in Baltimore, Alexandria, and Georgetown, then on the Baltimore and then the Georgetown Districts (as Presiding Elder) The preacher Enoch George belonged to the primitive school of American Methodist preachers. Though many of these had little or no scholastic advantages, yet some became highly effective preachers of the Gospel, also attaining proficiency in Biblical and theological learning. George was especially distinguished for the fervor and pathos of his pulpit ministry. Episcopal ministry After the death of Bishop Asbury, the Rev. Enoch George was elected and consecrated a Bishop of the M.E. Church by the General Conference, May 1816. He served with great zeal and effectiveness for the remaining twelve years of his life. He traveled, chiefly by private conveyance, through all parts of the country. He went as far as the frontier settlements of the west and southwest, usually preaching nearly every day at prearranged appointments. Remarkable manifestations of the influence that attended his preaching were regularly witnessed. Physical description Bishop George would never allow his portrait to be made. His personal appearance, therefore, is known only by tradition. He is described as of fair size and well proportioned, with dark hair worn long, and a complexion sallowed by exposure. Bishop Matthew Simpson wrote of him: :He was a man of deep piety, of great simplicity of manners, a pathetic, powerful and successful preacher, greatly beloved in life, and very extensively lamented in death. Death and burial Bishop Enoch George died August 23, 1828 in Staunton, Virginia and was buried in Mount Olivet Cemetery in Baltimore.

It is situated two and a half miles east of Thornhill and near the gorge Crichope Linn. The origin of the name is unknown though in the past the locals called it Gateley Bridge, so perhaps it takes its name from a type of bridge over the Cample River in the centre of the settlement. The river divides the parishes, with all those east of the river being in Closeburn Parish, and those west of the river being in Morton Parish. The African explorer Joseph Thomson lived in Gatelawbridge from the age of 10 until leaving for Edinburgh. He attended the secondary school Morton Academy in Thornhill (now Wallace Hall Academy), making the journey each day on his pony called Donald. His father was the quarry master and presumably that is where his interest in rocks began. He studied geology at the University of Edinburgh. After graduating he was engaged on several explorations in East and North Africa. He discovered the Thomson's Falls in Kenya and the Thomson's gazelle is named after him. He was known to be a kind and very fair man, who refused to beat his bearers in Africa when they did wrong, preferring to dock their wages instead. This however was quite unpopular at the time with the bearers who at one point went on strike and left him. He became ill due to infections picked up on his travels and died a young man. His friends erected a fine monument to him which stands next to the school in Thornhill. Gatelawbridge is the site of several Red Sandstone quarries opened in the 19th century that were once linked by rail to the G&SWR; main line near Cample village. They are now largely disused. The sandstone derived from a huge sand dune which extended from Gatelawbridge through Locharbriggs to Annan. This sandstone is the building material of much of Dumfriesshire, and was exported to America where it was used to build the famous 'brownstones' of New York.

He is best known for failing a drug test after finishing third in the men's slalom of the 2002 Winter Olympics, resulting in him being controversially stripped of the bronze medal; he would have become the first Briton to win an Olympic medal in a skiing event. The use of a nasal inhaler purchased in the US had led to the presence of a banned substance in Baxter's urine. He was allowed to return to competition, although his appeal to have the medal reinstated failed. He competed in FIS events from 1991‚Äì2009 and became known as \\"The Highlander\\". In the World Cup events, he achieved eleven top-fifteen finishes and four top-ten results. Background Baxter was born on 26 December 1973 in Edinburgh, Scotland. He is the son of Iain and Sue Baxter, who were both British Ski Team members. Baxter's father named him after Alan Breck Stewart, a character from the Robert Louis Stevenson novel Kidnapped, who was a rebellious Highlander. The French spelling led some to believe he was named after the 70s French skiing star Alain Penz. At 16 years of age, he was selected to the British Alpine Ski Team in 1991. Baxter's first 10 years of competition were achieved without him having access to any significant funding. Austrian journalists gave him the sobriquet \\"The Highlander\\". He steadily worked his way through the world rankings, making the top 100 in time for the 1998 Nagano Winter Olympics. At Nagano he straddled a gate and was disqualified, having been 15th-fastest at the checkpoint just before. His best result in World Cup was 4th at √Öre 11 March 2001 and he had three other top 10 finishes in 2001. In 2001, at Wengen he finished seventh in the World Cup Slalom, the best performance by a Britain at the Swiss resort. Ahead of the Olympics, ski technology was developing rapidly and Baxter's sponsor Head, was struggling to keep up the progress made by other ski manufacturers. Salt Lake City Olympics In the Salt Lake City Olympics of 2002, Baxter made British Olympic history on 23 February by becoming the first British skier to win a medal (Bronze) in alpine skiing. In the men's slalom, Baxter was in eighth place in the first run, then rose to third after the second run. Before the competition he had dyed his hair in the pattern of the Saltire cross of St Andrew: the flag of Scotland. The British Olympic Association (BOA) ordered him to remove the political symbol, but the blue dye he used to try to obliterate the white saltire was a different shade, and the saltire pattern could still clearly be seen when he won his medal. Medal controversy On 1 March, as he was leaving the Olympic village to return home, Baxter was informed by the BOA that a sample he submitted had tested positive for a restricted substance. Baxter returned home to Aviemore to a hero's welcome and a parade around the town in an open top bus. On 5 March the BOA released a statement on his behalf, revealing that he had failed a drugs test, with his urine having tested positive for the prohibited substance, methamphetamine. Baxter stated that he had not knowingly ingested, and that he would not make any further statement until the IOC's inquiry and disciplinary commissions ruled on his case. After the first sample tested positive, a disciplinary stage was expected to follow and the British Olympic Association offered their support. The International Olympic Committee (IOC) held a private two-day hearing in Lausanne, where Baxter would be able to speak, with the outcome expected the following week. On 21 March, Baxter held a Press conference in London, where he offered an explanation that he believed a nasal inhaler that he had used had been the cause of the positive test. the IOC announced the decision of their executive board that Baxter was disqualified and was told to return his medal. Baxter returned the medal, for it to be awarded to Austrian Benjamin Raich. Urine tests Baxter had provided a urine sample immediately after the race on 23 February. Initial reports were that his urine sample contained a trace amount of methamphetamine, a banned stimulant. The BOA formally asked the IOC to carry out a split test on Baxter's sample on the basis that there are two forms of the drug. The more advanced tests showed that the substance present was levMethamphetamine, a levorotary isomer of methamphetamine, which has no significant stimulant properties. Baxter later proved the source of levMethamphetamine was from a Vicks inhaler that he had used in the United States. He had been unaware that the contents were different from those found in the UK version. The International Ski Federation accepted his explanation and on 2 June announced they would require him to serve a ban of 3 months, on the basis that this was a first offence of unintentionally using a prohibited substance. This sanction meant he would miss the first month of the 2002‚Äì3 World Cup season and an appeal was lodged in late June. International Ski Federation appeal The British Ski and Snowboard Federation appealed to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) and the case was heard on 30 September 2002. The appeal was successful and his ban was overturned. This gave the Baxter camp great hope for the next appeal to have his medal returned. Olympic appeal The British Olympic Association assisted with, and publicly funded, an appeal against the loss of his medal. In October 2002 his medal appeal was heard by the Court of Arbitration for Sport in Lausanne. The basis of the appeal was that the form of methamphetamine in the USA Vicks levMethamphetamine is an inactive isomer of methamphetamine. The CAS and the IOC agreed that he had not intentionally ingested the substance. Under the strict liability doctrine, athletes are liable if they inadvertently take any form of potentially performance-enhancing substance, and a large number of athletes have lost medals as a result. Cold cures and other over-the-counter medicines are the most common sources of trace levels of amphetamines and other stimulants. His appeal rested on whether levAmphetamine was performance- enhancing, Vicks and other expert witnesses explained that it was a decongestant, and had negligible stimulant properties. Dr Don Catlin maintained that the banned list did not specify isomers so all forms were on the banned list and the strict liability doctrine applied. This was particularly controversial since 100 US athletes who won 19 medals tested positive for stimulants at his laboratory, and were cleared to continue competing, and Dr. Catlin was named as part of a 3-man committee that routinely allowed US Olympians such as Carl Lewis to continue competing despite failing drugs tests.US Track & Field Coverups The vast majority of athletes named in Wade Exum's papers tested positive for stimulants found in over-the-counter cold medicines. Most were cleared after explaining that they had taken the substances inadvertently. The Baxter Appeal team headed by Professor Arnold Beckett, a former member of the IOC medical commission, thought Dr Catlin's position was \\"inconsistent\\". He stated, \\"The things we are being told about in the USA make me very angry, particularly in relation to Alain Baxter's case. He did not take a banned substance, as levAmphetamine was not on the list, but it was Dr Catlin's evidence which the appeal committee believed.\\" The court upheld the IOC's decision to disqualify Baxter. The CAS judgement found that \\"The panel is not without sympathy for Mr Baxter, who appears to be a sincere and honest man who did not intend to obtain a competitive advantage in the race.\\" Nevertheless, they found that his offence had been committed and as such would not reinstate the medal. In December 2002, Raich received the bronze medal. Return to competition In 2004 Baxter won his seventh British Slalom title, a record that was unequalled until Dave Ryding also won a seventh title in 2016. While his form never quite reached the same heights as they did in Salt Lake City, Alain Baxter remained the highest ranked and most recognisable male alpine skier in the UK. He was well respected by the more established skiing nations and his talent was the best the UK had produced. He competed in the 2006 Winter Olympics at Turin, where he finished 16th in the slalom. In 2008, facing ongoing difficulties for funding, he posed naked for photographer Trevor Yerbury to produce a \\"tastefully nude\\" calendar. Affected by a chronic back injury, he announced his retirement from competitive skiing in April 2009, age 35. Following retirement from competition, Baxter runs a ski shop near Glasgow. In February 2014 an online petition was launched to return his medal. Other sports He is also a keen player of shinty, and turned out for Kincraig Shinty Club when that club was still active. Baxter won the 2005 British Superstars event, defeating Du'aine Ladejo who had edged Baxter out for the 2003 title. After announcing his retirement from downhill skiing in 2009, Baxter decided to try track-cycling. He had some assistance from the Scottish Institute of Sport's talent transfer programme. Baxter made his debut on a track bike racing at Manchester Velodrome on 5 December 2009, at part of the Revolution (cycling series) - Season 6. He set himself a goal of racing in the Commonwealth Games in 2010 which he unfortunately did not achieve. In 2015, Baxter took part in Red Bull Crashed Ice racing events in Belfast and Quebec as part of a Scottish side. He qualified for the final in Quebec but withdrew from the final after sustaining broken ribs. Family His brother, Noel Baxter is also an alpine skier. His cousin Lesley McKenna is a leading professional snowboarder and winner of two World Cups. Baxter married businesswoman Sheila Dow in 2006, after the two met at Finlay Mickel's wedding the previous year. They have three children. Honours In 2014, the decision was taken to name a housing development in Aviemore \\"Baxter's Court\\" in his honour.

Life Born at Mere Hall, Cheshire on 2 May 1675, the second son of Henry Booth, 1st Earl of Warrington by Mary Langham, daughter of Sir James Langham Bt, of Cottesbrooke, he was known by the courtesy title of Lord Delamer before succeeding to the family titles upon his father's death in 1694. Apart from being a renowned collector of silver plate, he received the appointment of Lord Lieutenant of Cheshire, another nobleman being nominated to discharge the duties during his minority. In 1739, he wrote, Considerations upon the Institution of Marriage, with some thoughts concerning the force and obligation of the marriage contract, wherein is considered how far divorces may or may not be allowed, By a Gentleman. Humbly submitted to the judgment of the impartial. It is an argument in favour of divorce on the ground of incompatibility of temper. From other sources we learn that he had been convinced of the advisability of admitting this as a sufficient reason by his own unhappy experiences. Luttrell states that the lady had a fortune of ¬£40,000, and Philip Bliss, in a manuscript note in a copy of Walpole's Royal and Noble Authors, now in the British Museum, adds: Of the earl and his lady there is an amusing and not too flattering description in a letter by Mrs, Bradshaw, printed in Letters to and from Henrietta, Countess of Suffolk (1824), i. 97: George, 2nd Earl of Warrington Besides his pamphlet on divorce the earl was the author of a Letter to the writer of the \\"Present State of the Republic of Letters\\", vindicating his father from the reflections against him in Burnet's History of his own Time. Lord Warrington died on 2 August 1758, and was buried in the Booth Chapel, the family vault, at Bowdon Church, 3 miles (4.8 km) from Dunham Massey Hall. Family In 1702, Lord Warrington married Mary Oldbury, daughter of Sir John Oldbury, a City merchant, of St Dunstan's in the East, by his wife, Mary Bohun. Mary, Countess of Warrington died in 1740, having given birth to only child. Their daughter and heiress, Lady Mary Booth, married in 1736 Henry Grey, 4th Earl of Stamford, who inherited the estates in Cheshire and Lancashire. Upon his death, the earldom of Warrington became extinct, whilst the other family titles of Baron Delamer and the baronetcy created in 1611, devolved upon his cousin, Nathaniel Booth. Their only daughter, Lady Mary Booth, became the Countess of Stamford upon marrying Henry Grey, 4th Earl of Stamford, and she inherited all the Booth estates, including Dunham Massey Hall and Staley Hall. Their son, George Grey, 5th Earl of Stamford was recreated in 1796 Earl of Warrington in addition to the Stamford title, the family being known as Earls of Stamford and Warrington (until the death in 1905 of the dowager Countess Katharine, widow of George Grey, 7th Earl of Stamford).

Here the water is at the ‚Äútop nut‚Äù, the maximum working level. Note the patterned backplate to help reading and toughened glass shroud. A sight glass or water gauge is a type of level sensor, a transparent tube through which the operator of a tank or boiler can observe the level of liquid contained within. Liquid in tanks Simple sight glasses may be just a plastic or glass tube connected to the bottom of the tank at one end and the top of the tank at the other. The level of liquid in the sight glass will be the same as the level of liquid in the tank. Today, however, sophisticated float switches have replaced sight glasses in many such applications. Steam boilers If the liquid is hazardous or under pressure, more sophisticated arrangements must be made. In the case of a boiler, the pressure of the water below and the steam above is equal, so any change in the water level will be seen in the gauge. The transparent tube (the ‚Äúglass‚Äù itself) may be mostly enclosed within a metal or toughened glass shroud to prevent it from being damaged through scratching or impact and offering protection to the operators in the case of breakage. This usually has a patterned backplate to make the magnifying effect of the water in the tube more obvious and so allow for easier reading. In some locomotives where the boiler is operated at very high pressures, the tube itself would be made of metal-reinforced toughened glass. It is important to keep the water at the specified level, otherwise the top of the firebox will be exposed, creating an overheat hazard and causing damage and possibly catastrophic failure. To check that the device is offering a correct reading and the connecting pipes to the boiler are not blocked by scale, the water level needs to be ‚Äúbobbed‚Äù by quickly opening the taps in turn and allowing a brief spurt of water through the drain cock.Unidentified author (1957). Handbook for steam locomotive enginemen. London: British Transport Commission. The National Board of Boiler and Pressure Vessel Inspectors recommends a daily testing procedure described by the American National Standards Institute, chapter 2 part I-204.3 water level gauge. While not strictly required, this procedure is designed to allow an operator to safely verify that all parts of the sight glass are operating correctly and have free flowing connections to the boiler necessary for proper operation. Failure The gauge glass on a boiler needs to be inspected periodically and replaced if it is seen to have worn thin in the vicinity of the gland nuts, but a failure in service can still occur. Drivers are expected to carry two or three glass tubes, pre-cut to the required length, together with hemp or rubber seals, to replace the tubes on the road. Familiarity with this disquieting occurrence was considered so important that a glass would often be smashed deliberately while a trainee driver was on the footplate, to give him practice in fitting a new tube. Although automatic ball valves are fitted in the mounts to limit the release of steam and scalding water, these can fail through accumulation of limescale. It was standard procedure to hold the coal scoop in front of the face while the other hand, holding the cap for protection, reached to turn off the valves at both ends of the glass. Reflex gauges A reflex gauge is more complex in construction but can give a clearer distinction between gas (steam) and liquid (water). Instead of containing the media in a glass tube, the gauge consists of a vertically oriented slotted metal body with a strong glass plate mounted on the open side of the slot facing the operator. The rear of the glass, in contact with the media, has grooves moulded into its surface, running vertically. The grooves form a zig- zag pattern with 90¬∞ angles. Incident light entering the glass is refracted at the rear surface in contact with the media. In the region that is contact with the gas, most of the light is reflected from the surface of one groove to the next and back towards the operator, appearing silvery white. In the region that is in contact with the liquid, most of the light is refracted into the liquid causing this region to appear almost black to the operator. Well-known makes of reflex gauge are Clark-Reliance, IGEMA,TGI Ilmadur,Penberthy, Jerguson, Klinger, Cesare-Bonetti and Kenco. Due to the caustic nature of boiler anti-scaling treatments (\\"water softeners\\"), reflex gauges tend to become relatively rapidly etched by the water and lose their effectivess at displaying the liquid level. Therefore, bi-colour gauges are recommended for certain types of boiler, particularly those operating at pressure above 60 bar. Bi-colour gauges A bi-colour gauge is generally preferred for caustic media in order to afford protection to the glass. The gauge consists of a vertically oriented slotted metal body with a strong plain glass to the front and the rear. The front and rear body surfaces are in non-parallel vertical planes. Behind the gauge body are light sources with two quite different wavelengths, typically red and green. Due to the different refraction of the red and green light, the liquid region appears green to the operator, while the gas region appears red. Unlike the reflex gauge, the glass has a plane surface which it does not need to be in direct contact with the media and can be protected with a layer of a caustic-resistant transparent material such as silica. Well-known manufacturers of the highest quality Bi-Colour Level Gauges are Clark-Reliance, Klinger, FPS-Aquarian, IGEMA and Quest-Tec Magnetic indicator In a magnetic indicator is a float on the surface of the liquid contains a permanent magnet. The liquid is contained in a chamber of strong, non-magnetic material, avoiding the use of glass. The level indicator consists of a number of pivoting magnetic vanes arranged one above the other and placed close to the chamber containing the float. The two faces of the vanes are differently coloured. As the magnet passes up and down behind the vanes it cause them to rotate, displaying one colour for the region containing the liquid and another for the region containing gas. Magnetic indicators are stated in various manufacturers' literature to be most suitable for very high pressure and / or temperature and for aggressive liquids. History The first locomotive to be fitted with the device was built in 1829 by John Rastrick at his Stourbridge works. Modern industrial sight glass Industrial observational instruments have changed with industry itself. More structurally sophisticated than the water gauge, the contemporary sight glass ‚Äî also called the sight window or sight port ‚Äî can be found on the media vessel at chemical plants and in other industrial settings, including pharmaceutical, food, beverage and bio gas plants. Sight glasses enable operators to visually observe processes inside tanks, pipes, reactors and vessels. The modern industrial sight glass is a glass disk held between two metal frames, which are secured by bolts and gaskets, or the glass disc is fused to the metal frame during manufacture. The glass used for this purpose is either soda lime glass or borosilicate glass, and the metal, usually a type of stainless steel, is chosen for desired properties of strength. Borosilicate glass is superior to other formulations in terms of chemical corrosion resistance and temperature tolerance, as well as transparency. Fused sight glasses are also called mechanically prestressed glass, because the glass is strengthened by compression of the metal ring. Heat is applied to a glass disc and its surrounding steel ring, causing a fusion of the materials. As the steel cools, it contracts, compressing the glass and making it resistant to tension. Because glass typically breaks under tension, mechanically prestressed glass is unlikely to break and endanger workers. The strongest sight glasses are made with borosilicate glass, because of the greater difference in its coefficient of expansions.

Etymology  The name is likely related to an archaic word, , meaning rock flake or carving stone. In the Kjalnesinga saga, there is a rich widow among Irish settlers named Esja, but it is likely that the woman's name is derived from the mountain and not vice versa. Esja can be used as a given name in Iceland. Formation Esja was built up at the end of the Pleistocene with the beginning of the Ice Age. During the warm periods lava flowed, and in the cold periods ridges of tuff were built up under the glacier. The western part of the mountain range is the oldest (about 3.2 million years) and the eastern part is the youngest (about 1.8 million years).

The result was a series of large lava fields, one above the other, which the Ice Age glacier ground down. It left only the highest summits, like the mountain ranges of Esja or Akrafjall. Physical features The easternmost summits of the mountain range, called M√≥skar√∞shn√∫kar, are of an unusually light colour. An Icelandic writer in the 19th century, so goes the story, hoped to see the sun there after a long period of rain. But when he looked closer, it was only the mountaintops with their colours. In reality, it is the rhyolite stone, often to be found in Icelandic nature near old (and also active) central volcanos.  Hiking and climbing  Within easy reach of the capital, Esja is a very popular recreation area for hikers and climbers. The best known hiking paths lead to the summits √ûverfellshorn (780 m) and Kerh√≥lakambur (851 m). √ûverfellshorn is also easily accessible by public transport. The path is divided into sections, marked with signs along the way. Each sign gives an indication of the difficulty of the path ahead with a grade system ranging from 1 boot (easy) to 3 boots (challenging). At the third sign experienced climbers can choose to climb directly to the peak, instead of following the path which goes off to the right.Esjan - lei√∞ir og saga Ferlir.is (in Icelandic) After approximately 6.6 kilometers of walking and 597 meters altitude gain is a big rock called Steinn. It is here that most inexperienced climbers choose to go down again, as the path becomes increasingly difficult from there. The highest point, at 914 m, is called H√°bunga. From √ûverfellshorn, reaching H√°bunga requires another three-kilometer trek northeast, across a rocky plateau with no directional signs or clear path. As of August 2011, H√°bunga was marked only by a large cairn with a wooden stick at the top.

She was a founding member of Jacques Copeau's Th√©√¢tre du Vieux-Colombier in Paris during the first season 1913-14. Later she worked with the troupe in New York from 1917-19 and again in Paris, 1920-24. Early life and formative years Suzanne Bing was born in Paris in the 2nd arrondissement. When Bing joined the Vieux-Colombier in 1913, she came to the company with some experience in the artistic circles of Paris. She married the composer Edgard Var√®se on 5 November 1907 after spending two years at the Paris Conservatoire de Musique et de D√©clamation where vocal training was more important than acting. She spent several years in Berlin where Var√®se tried to make a living. After their daughter, Claude, was born in October 1910, she continued to act in various venues in Paris. But by 1913 Var√®se and Bing decided they should pursue their respective careers, and they divorced.N.N.: Chronologie de Edgard Var√®se ; in French. URL last accessed July 18, 2006. At the Vieux-Colombier During the first season of the Vieux-Colombier in Paris, Bing played several important roles, the most critically acclaimed of which was her Viola in an adaptation of Shakespeare's Twelfth Night, (Nuit des rois). When war broke out in August 1914, the second season was cancelled as most of the men either volunteered or were called up for service. Bing continued her collaboration with Copeau as he pursued his concept for a school for actors where his ideals of respect for the text and an acting style freed of rhetorical flourishes common during the era would be taught to young people drawn to a vocation in the theater. Bing, with her own acting experience and training, was an invaluable source of knowledge and support for Copeau. Their first efforts took place in November 1915 with a group of children ranging in age from six to fourteen years. Bing worked as an assistant to Copeau during these sessions, sometimes replacing him in his absence. Her ability to work with the youngsters in a relaxed and playful atmosphere contributed to the success of this undertaking and helped Copeau in his understanding of various techniques, such as improvisation and music-based movement, that he would incorporate later into a more elaborate curriculum. After Copeau was excused from military service because of illness, the professional and intimate lives of Bing and Copeau became increasingly intertwined, as she worked with him to establish some basic guidelines for a school. They collaborated on a translation of Shakespeare's The Winter's Tale, finished in 1916. In March 1917, while Copeau was in New York City for a series of lectures, Bing gave birth to their son, Bernard. To New York and back During the two-year stint of the Vieux-Colombier at the Garrick Theatre on 35th Street in New York City, Bing reprised the role of Viola in Nuit des rois, and seven other roles ranging from Elise in Moli√®re's L‚ÄôAvare to Astolphe in Alfred de Musset's Barberine during the first season and some thirteen roles in the second season, including Cherubin in Le Mariage de Figaro of Beaumarchais, M√©lisande in Maurice Maeterlinck's Pell√©as et M√©lisande, and Mrs. Helseth in Henrik Ibsen's Rosmersholm. In a review, the magazine The Nation wrote on 29 March 1919: \\"Suzanne Bing seems to be a flame of inspiration to the group, and one comes to look for her, in however humble a capacity, in almost every performance, ...\\"The Nation, issue of March 19, 1919. See the searchable archives (pay-per-view), or the Google cache. URLs last accessed July 18, 2006. More importantly she continued to collaborate with Copeau on his idea of a school for young actors. She participated in activities at the Children's School founded by Margaret Naumberg, Waldo Frank's wife, who put into practice many of the concepts of Maria Montessori. During the summer of 1918, while the troupe of the Vieux-Colombier was lodged at the New Jersey estate of Otto H. Kahn, she and Marie-H√©l√®ne (later Mme Dast√©), known as \\"Mai√®ne\\", Copeau's oldest child, began to construct masks and work on activities that included movement and masks. Upon their return to Paris in 1919, Copeau did not immediately re-open the Th√©√¢tre du Vieux- Colombier, but the desire to open a school for actors remained ever-present. Again Suzanne Bing played an important role in both areas. The theater began its season with Shakespeare's Winter's Tale on 9 February 1920 in the Copeau/Bing adaptation and acting classes for a group of adults began on 1 March under the direction of Copeau and Bing. When it became obvious that a suitable locale for a theater school was not available, Bing started lessons with youngsters between the ages of fourteen and eighteen the following December in space above the theater. For the next four years, she shared her talents between the theater and her young charges at the √âcole du Vieux- Colombier, which now had its own space several blocks from the theater and a full-blown program of studies. Although Copeau thought it best to protect his students from the influence of the professional theater, he did allow them to participate to critical acclaim in a production of Andr√© Gide's Saul in which they played masked demons. Bing's work with her students was put on display in an adaptation of a Noh play, Katan, which they presented in 1924 before an astonished Copeau and Harley Granville-Barker.  The \\"Copiaus\\" and the Compagnie des Quinze  Abruptly at the end of the 1924 season, Copeau disbanded his theater company and, with those actors who were willing and some of the students from the school, moved to Burgundy. Thus began a fascinating saga in the countryside that was to last some five years. The motley group of some thirty-five students and actors first settled in Morteuil and then finally in Pernand-Vergelesse, a village not far from Beaune, deep in the wine-producing area of Burgundy. With the school abandoned because of a lack of funds in 1925, this odd mixture of actors and students, along with Copeau's nephew, Michel Saint-Denis, slowly formed themselves into a troupe that relied on the development of characters of their creation they developed through improvisation and mask work. The concept of a New Comedy that Copeau had developed much earlier during the war years came to fruition here with Bing, Mai√®ne, St-Denis and Jean Dast√©, who would soon become Copeau's son-in-law (he married Mai√®ne). The masked characters, reminiscent of the commedia dell'arte, became part of their repertoire as they played in pieces written expressly for them by Copeau or that resulted from their improvisations. As they traveled from village to village putting on their plays in town squares, led by actors in costume and carrying banners, accompanied by drums and music, Burgundians began calling them the \\"Copiaus\\". The name soon marked them as progeny of Copeau's concept of the theater--a theater reduced to its essence. Bing's influence here is not difficult to discern. Her interest in improvisation and masks grew into a devotion both to the development of her former students, Mai√®ne, Jean Dast√©, Etienne Decroux, Jean Dorcy, and to the continuation of the concepts of Copeau, the man they all called \\"patron.\\" As the transition from student actor to professional took place under Bing's aegis, they developed new techniques based on their improvisations and mask work. The result was that the students of the √âcole du Vieux-Colombier became themselves teachers and professional actors devoted to a well-honed craft. In 1929 this small group left Burgundy for Paris to establish the Compagnie des Quinze, under the direction of Michel Saint-Denis. Their first production, No√©, written for the company by Andr√© Obey, was produced on the stage of the Vieux- Colombier in 1931. All the training of the actor's instruments--body and voice --along with the highly developed use of the mask were put on display in this work in which most of the actors played masked animal characters.  Later life and legacy  Although not working directly in the theater under Copeau, Bing continued her collaboration with him on a translation of the tragedies of Shakespeare published in 1939. She, like many theater actors of her generation, tried her hand at the art of the film in Le Calvaire de Cimiez (1934).IMDb: Le calvaire de Cimiez. URL last accessed July 18, 2006.Constantin, J.-P.: Suzanne Bing. URL last accessed July 18, 2006 Illness drained her energies, but not her spirit. Even during World War II, when she was forced to wear the hated star despite her conversion to Catholicism, she maintained her dignity. Although set up in a retirement home, by Copeau in 1947, she continued to work, giving elocution lessons and readings to foreign students at the Sorbonne. The French translations of the comedies of Shakespeare, her last collaboration with Copeau, were published in 1952.University of Basel: Shakespeare translations . URL last accessed July 18, 2006. She remained throughout her life the most ardent believer in Copeau's concepts of the theater. Without her it is unlikely that the √âcole du Vieux-Colombier would have achieved its many successes, as can be seen in the influence her students exercised in the world of the theater between the two wars and after. She helped transform the formation of the actor in France--a tradition carried on subsequently by Jacques Lecoq and Ariane Mnouchkine. Suzanne Bing died 1967 in Neuilly-sur-Seine.

It was organised into two battalions, one around Jonesborough and another around Crossmaglen. By the 1990s, the South Armagh Brigade was thought to consist of about 40 members, roughly half of them living south of the border.O'Brien, p. 204 It has allegedly been commanded since the 1970s by Thomas 'Slab' Murphy who is also alleged to be a member of the IRA's Army Council. Compared to other brigades, the South Armagh IRA was seen as an 'independent republic' within the republican movement, retaining a battalion organizational structure and not adopting the cell structure the rest of the IRA was forced to adopt after repeated intelligence failures.O'Brien, p. 206 As well as paramilitary activity, the South Armagh Brigade has also been widely accused of smuggling across the Irish border.Harnden, pp. 178-179, 204-205. Between 1970 and 1997 the brigade was responsible for the deaths of 165 members of British security forces (123 British soldiers and 42 Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC) officers). A further 75 civilians were killed in the area during the conflict, as well as ten South Armagh Brigade members.O'Brien, p. 160 The RUC recorded 1,255 bombings and 1,158 shootings around a radius of ten miles from the geographic centre of South Armagh in the same period. 1970s South Armagh has a long Irish republican tradition. Many men in the area served in the Fourth Northern Division of the Irish Republican Army during the Irish War of Independence (1919‚Äì21) and, unlike most of the rest of the Northern Ireland IRA, on the republican side in the Irish Civil War (1922‚Äì23). Men from the area also took part in IRA campaigns in the 1940 and 1950s. At the beginning of the Northern Ireland Troubles in August 1969, rioters, led by IRA men, attacked the RUC barracks in Crossmaglen, in retaliation for the attacks on Catholic/nationalist areas in Belfast in the Northern Ireland riots of August 1969.Harnden (1999), p. 56 After the split in the IRA in that year, the South Armagh unit sided with the Provisional IRA rather than the Official IRA. The following August, two RUC constables were killed by a car bomb in Crossmaglen.Harnden, pp. 39-42. However, the IRA campaign in the area did not begin in earnest until 1971. On 7 August of that year, Harry Thornton, a 29-year-old sewage worker from South Armagh was shot and killed by the British Army while staying in a car outside Springfield Road base in Belfast, he and his coworker Arthur Murphy having been mistaken for gunmen. Murphy was lightly wounded and arrested by the RUC. The incident caused outrage among South Armagh residents, provided the IRA with many new recruits and created a hostile climate where local people were prepared to tolerate the killing of security force members.Harnden, pp. 49-55. During the early 1970s, the brigade was mostly engaged in ambushes of British Army patrols. In one such ambush in August 1972, a Ferret armoured car was destroyed by a 600 lb landmine, killing one soldier. There were also frequent gun attacks on foot patrols. Travelling overland in South Armagh eventually became so dangerous that the British Army began using helicopters to transport troops and supply its bases - a practice that had to be continued until the late 1990s. According to author Toby Harnden, the decision was taken shortly after a Saracen armoured vehicle was destroyed by a culvert bomb near Crossmaglen, on 9 October 1975. Subsequently, the British Army gave up the use of roads to the IRA in South Armagh.Harnden, Toby (1999). Bandit Country. Hodder & Stoughton.

He was identified as the IRA's chief technical officer by the Central Intelligence Agency.Oppenheimer, A. R. (2009). IRA: The Bombs and The Bullets. A History of Deadly Ingenuity. Irish Academic Press, p. 279-280. Another noted IRA commander at that time was the commanding officer of the first battalion, Captain Michael McVerry. He was eventually killed during an attack on the RUC barracks in Keady in November 1973. Around this time IRA engineers in South Armagh pioneered the use of home-made mortars which were relatively inaccurate but highly destructive.Harnden, p. 19. In 1975 and 1976, as sectarian violence increased in Northern Ireland, the South Armagh Republican Action Force, allegedly a cover-name for the South Armagh Brigade, carried out two attacks against Protestants. In September 1975 they attacked an Orange lodge in Newtownhamilton, killing five members of the lodge. Then, in January 1976, after a series of loyalist Ulster Volunteer Force (UVF) attacks on Catholic civilians in the border areas (including the Reavey and O'Dowd killings the previous day), the group shot and killed ten Protestant workmen in the \\"Kingsmill massacre\\" near Bessbrook. The workers' bus was stopped and the one Catholic worker taken aside before the others were killed.Richard English, Armed Struggle, A History of the IRA, page 172 In response, the British government stated that it was dispatching the Special Air Service (SAS) to South Armagh, although the SAS had been present in the area for many years. While loyalist attacks on Catholics temporarily declined afterwards and many Protestants became more reluctant to help the UVF, the massacre caused considerable controversy in the republican movement. By the end of the 1970s, the IRA in most of Northern Ireland had been restructured into a cell system. South Armagh, however, where the close rural community and family connections of IRA men diminished the risk of infiltration, retained its larger \\"battalion\\" structure. On 17 February 1978 the commander of the 2nd Battalion Royal Green Jackets, Lieutenant Colonel Ian Corden-Lloyd, was killed and two other soldiers injured when the Gazelle helicopter he was travelling in was attacked by an IRA unit near Jonesborough. At that moment, a gun battle was taking place on the ground between British soldiers and members of the South Armagh Brigade. The helicopter crashed while taking evasive manoeuvres after being fired at from the east side of Edenappa road. Corden-Lloyd's subordinates had been accused of brutality against Catholic civilians in Belfast in 1971.McGuffin, John (1973). Internment. Anvil Books Ltd,Chapter 11 In August 1979, a South Armagh unit killed 18 soldiers in the Warrenpoint ambush.Harnden, p. 135. This was the biggest single loss of life inflicted on the British Army in its deployment in Northern Ireland (Operation Banner). A number of South Armagh IRA members were imprisoned by the end of the 1970s and took part in the blanket protest and dirty protest in pursuit of political status for IRA prisoners. Raymond McCreesh, a South Armagh man, was among the ten republican hunger strikers who died for this goal in the 1981 hunger strike. The South Armagh Brigade retaliated for the deaths of the hunger strikers by killing five British soldiers with a mine that destroyed their armoured vehicle near Bessbrook.Harnden, pp. 490-491. 1980s During the mid-1980s, the brigade focused its attacks on the RUC, killing 20 of its members between 1984 and 1986. Nine of these were killed in the February 1985 Newry mortar attack.Harnden, p. 167. In 1986, the British Army erected ten hilltop observation posts in South Armagh. These bases acted as information- gathering centres and also allowed the British Army to patrol South Armagh more securely. Between 1971 and the erection of the hilltop sites in the mid-1980s (the first in 1986), 84 members of the security forces were killed in the Crossmaglen and Forkhill areas by the IRA. After this, 24 security force personnel and Lord Justice Gibson and his wife were killed in the same areas, roughly a third of the previous yearly rate. In March 1989, two senior RUC officers were killed in an ambush near Jonesborough. Chief Superintendent Harry Breen and Superintendent Bob Buchanan were returning from a meeting with the Garda S√≠och√°na in the Republic of Ireland, where they had been discussing a range of issues including ways of combating IRA attacks on the cross-border rail link, when they were ambushed. This incident was investigated by the Smithwick Tribunal into alleged collusion between the IRA and the Garda√≠. As the divisional commander for South Armagh, Breen was the most senior policeman to have been killed during the Troubles.BBC On This DAY - 20 March 1989 \\"Senior RUC men die in gun attack\\" Retrieved 24 October 2011 South Armagh became the most heavily militarised area in Northern Ireland. In an area with a population of 23,000, the British Army stationed around 3,000 troops in support of the RUC to contain an unknown number of paramilitaries. 1990s In the late 1980s and early 1990s, the IRA elsewhere in Northern Ireland found that nine out of ten planned operations failed to materialise.O'Brien, p. 157 However, the South Armagh Brigade continued to carry out varied and high- profile attacks in the same period.O'Brien, p. 207 By 1991, the RUC acknowledged that no mobile patrols had operated in South Armagh without Army support since 1975.O'Brien, p. 205 On 30 December 1990, Sinn F√©in member and IRA volunteer, Fergal Caraher, was killed by Royal Marines near a checkpoint in Cullyhanna. His brother Michael Caraher, who was severely wounded in the shooting, later became the commander of one of the South Armagh sniper squads. These squads were responsible for killing seven soldiers and two RUC members until the Caraher team was finally caught by the Special Air Service in April 1997.Harnden, p. 291 The South Armagh Brigade also built the bombs that were used to wreck economic targets in London during the 1990s, specially hitting the financial district. The truck bombs were sent to England by ferry.Harnden, p. 230. On 22 April 1993, the South Armagh IRA unit took control of the village of Cullaville near the border with the Republic, for two hours, making good use of dead ground. The fact that the IRA executed the action despite the presence of a British Army watchtower nearby, caused outrage among British and Irish parliamentary circles.Transcripts of the Commons debate over the security situation in NI and the Cullaville incident (Column 196 in the first link and Column 184 in the second one): *Commons debate, 8 June 1993, columns 192-197 * Commons debate, 8 June 1993, columns 180-191Senead √âireann - 29 April 1993 The South Armagh Brigade was by far the most effective IRA brigade in shooting down British helicopters during the conflict.

The shooting down of the Lynx in 1994 during a mortar attack on Crossmaglen barracks is regarded by Toby Harnden as the most successful IRA operation against a helicopter in the course of the Troubles.Harnden, p. 398 A sustained machine gun attack against a helicopter was filmed by a Dublin television crew in March 1991 outside Crossmaglen Health Center. There was no reaction from British security although the RUC/Army base was just 50 yards away.O¬¥Brien, pp. 206-207 The only successful IRA attack against an Army helicopter outside South Armagh was carried out by the East Tyrone Brigade near Clogher, County Tyrone, on 11 February 1990. By 1994, the only way for the British army to travel safely across South Armagh and some areas of Tyrone and Fermanagh was on board troop-carrying Chinook helicopters.The only way to travel across bandit country Herald Scotland, 3 June 1994 Timeline of South Armagh Sniper operations and activity from March 1990 ‚Äì April 1997 *16 March 1990 - First use of the Barrett M82 sniper rifle in Northern Ireland by the South Armagh Brigade sniper teams.

Ceasefires and the peace process Borucki sangar, a British army outpost in Crossmaglen with a republican flag on top during an √ìgra Shinn F√©in protest some time before its removal in 2000 The IRA ceasefire of 1994 was a blow to the South Armagh Brigade, in that it allowed the security forces to operate openly in the area without fear of attack and to build intelligence on IRA members.Harnden,pp. 297‚Äì298 When the IRA resumed its campaign in 1996-97, the South Armagh IRA was less active than previously,Harnden, p. 411 although one of the sniper teams killed one soldier and seriously wounded an RUC constable. But the snipers also lost a number of their most skilled members, such as M√≠che√°l Caraher, who were arrested and imprisoned just weeks before the second ceasefire. The capture of the sniper team was the single major success for the security forces in South Armagh in more than a decade,Geraghty, page 185 and was arguably among the most important of the Troubles, but by then, the IRA and Sinn F√©in had achieved huge political gains towards their long-term goals.Strachan, Hew (2006). Big Wars and Small Wars: The British Army and the Lessons of War in the 20th Century. Routledge, p. 139. The last major action of the brigade before the last IRA ceasefire was a mortar attack on Newtownhamilton RUC/Army barracks, on 12 July 1997. The single Mk-15 mortar bomb landed 40 yards short of the perimeter fence.Harnden, p. 424 In 1997, several members of the South Armagh Brigade, based in Jonesborough and Dromintee, following Michael McKevitt, left the Provisional IRA because of its acceptance of the Mitchell Principles of non-violence at a General Army Convention in October of that year and formed a dissident grouping, the Real IRA, which rejected the peace process. Their discontent was deepened by Sinn F√©in's signing of the Good Friday Agreement in 1998. Most of the South Armagh IRA stayed within the Provisional movement, but there were reports of them aiding the dissidents throughout 1998.Harnden, pp. 311-313. The Omagh bombing of August 1998, a botched Real IRA operation which killed 29 civilians, was prepared by dissident republicans in South Armagh.Harnden, p. 316. Thomas Murphy and the leadership of the IRA in the area have allegedly since re- asserted their control, expelling dissidents from the district under threat of death. Michael McKevitt and his wife Bernadette were evicted from their home near Dundalk.Harnden, p. 311. IRA members in South Armagh ceased co-operating with the RIRA after the Omagh bombing.Mitchell, Thomas (2009). When Peace Fails: Lessons from Belfast for the Middle East. McFarland,p. 144. After the Provisional IRA announced its intention to disarm and accept peaceful methods in July 2005, the British government announced a full demilitarisation plan which included the closing of all British Army bases in South Armagh by 2007. The normalisation process, negotiated under the provisions of the Good Friday Agreement in exchange for the complete decommissioning of IRA weaponry, was one of the main goals of the republican political strategy in the region. Since the army wind-down in 2007, security in the area is the sole responsibility of the Police Service of Northern Ireland.\\"Orde visit seen as farewell to Army\\", by Phillp Bradfield. Belfast Today, 20 October 2006 Smuggling activities Senior IRA figures in South Armagh, notably Thomas Murphy, are alleged to have been involved in large-scale smuggling across the Irish border and money-laundering. Other alleged illegal activities involve fraud through embezzlement of agricultural subsidies and false claims of property loss. In 2006, the British and Irish authorities mounted joint operations to clamp down on smuggling in the area and to seize Thomas Murphy's assets. On 22 June 1998 a deadly incident involving fuel smuggling took place near Crossmaglen, when former Thomas Murphy employee Patrick Belton ran over and killed a British soldier attempting to stop him while driving his oil tanker through a military checkpoint. Belton was shot and injured by other members of the patrol, but managed to flee to the Republic. He was later acquitted of any charges, but he eventually agreed in 2006 to pay ‚Ç¨500,000 for cross-border smuggling.Harnden, p. 506Ex-Slab Murphy worker to pay ‚Ç¨500,000 by Suzanne Breen, Sunday Tribune, 24 April 2006 Some sources claim that the smuggling activities not only made the South Armagh brigade self-sustained, but also provided financial support to most of the IRA operations around Northern Ireland.Norwitz, Jeffrey (2009).

Film piracy, organized crime, and terrorism. Rand Corporation, p. 110. The IRA control over the roads across the border in South Armagh enabled them to impose 'taxes' on every cross-border illegal enterprise. South Armagh Memorial Garden A memorial garden was unveiled on 3 October 2010 in the village of Mullaghbawn, near Slieve Gullion mountain, with the names of 24 members of the South Armagh Brigade who died from different causes over the years inscribed upon a marble monument, along a bronze statue of Irish mythological hero C√∫ Chulainn. Martin McGuinness, then deputy First Minister of Northern Ireland, gave the main oration, while Conor Murphy, then Minister for Regional Development, introduced the families of the dead IRA members. The unveiling involved a large republican parade which failed to comply with the procedures of the Parades Commission. A Police Service of Northern Ireland spokesman confirmed that an investigation was underway, but also stated that both Sinn F√©in Ministers and everyone attending the parade were unaware that \\"the proper paperwork hadn't been submitted\\".Sinn Fein ministers McGuinness and Murphy in illegal parade Belfast Telegraph, 30 March 2011 See also *Provisional IRA campaign 1969-1997 *Provisional IRA East Tyrone Brigade *Provisional IRA Belfast Brigade *Provisional IRA Derry Brigade References Category:The Troubles in County Armagh Category:Military history of County Armagh Category:Provisional Irish Republican Army Brigades Category:1969 establishments in Northern Ireland ","title":"Provisional IRA South Armagh Brigade"},{"id":"4160744","text":"Pererius may refer to: * Benedict Pereira (1535‚Äì1610), Spanish Jesuit philosopher, theologian, and exegete * Isaac La Peyr√®re (1596‚Äì1676), French Millenarian theologian and formulator of Pre-Adamite theory ","title":"Pererius"},{"id":"4160756","text":"J√∫lius Jakoby (born as Gyula Jakoby, Ko≈°ice, 28 March 1903 ‚Äì Ko≈°ice, 15 April 1985) was a Slovak painter living in Ko≈°ice, a prominent figure of Slovak modernist art.Jakoby Gyula.

In electrical engineering, the term is used for ICs determining the current State of Charge of accumulators. Motor vehicles An analog fuel gauge in a 2016 Toyota Corolla featuring a \\"Moylan Arrow\\" indicating a fuel filler on the left side of the vehicle. As used in vehicles, the gauge consists of two parts: * The sending unit - in the tank * The indicator - on the dashboard The sending unit usually uses a float connected to a potentiometer, typically printed ink design in a modern automobile. As the tank empties, the float drops and slides a moving contact along the resistor, increasing its resistance.http://auto.howstuffworks.com/fuel-gauge2.htm In addition, when the resistance is at a certain point, it will also turn on a \\"low fuel\\" light on some vehicles. Meanwhile, the indicator unit (usually mounted on the dashboard) is measuring and displaying the amount of electric current flowing through the sending unit. When the tank level is high and maximum current is flowing, the needle points to \\"F\\" indicating a full tank. When the tank is empty and the least current is flowing, the needle points to \\"E\\" indicating an empty tank; some vehicles use the indicators \\"1\\" (for full) and \\"0\\" or \\"R\\" (for empty) instead. The digital fuel gauge in a 2018 Mazda 3 showing a nearly-empty tank along with a distance to empty display. The system can be fail-safe. If an electrical fault opens, the electrical circuit causes the indicator to show the tank as being empty (theoretically provoking the driver to refill the tank) rather than full (which would allow the driver to run out of fuel with no prior notification). Corrosion or wear of the potentiometer will provide erroneous readings of fuel level. However, this system has a potential risk associated with it. An electric current is sent through the variable resistor to which a float is connected, so that the value of resistance depends on the fuel level. In most automotive fuel gauges such resistors are on the inward side of the gauge, i.e., inside the fuel tank. Sending current through such a resistor has a fire hazard and an explosion risk associated with it. These resistance sensors are also showing an increased failure rate with the incremental additions of alcohol in automotive gasoline fuel. Alcohol increases the corrosion rate at the potentiometer, as it is capable of carrying current like water. Potentiometer applications for alcohol fuel use a pulse-and-hold methodology, with a periodic signal being sent to determine fuel level decreasing the corrosion potential. Therefore, demand for another safer, non-contact method for fuel level is desired. Moylan arrow Since the early 1990s, many fuel gauges have included an icon with a fuel pump and an arrow, indicating the side of the vehicle on which the fuel filler is located.Do You Need to Warm Up Your Car? Plus, a Teeny, Glorious Car Hack\\", Every Little Thing Podcast, October 8, 2018 Jason Torchinsky, The Inventor of the Little Arrow that Tells You What Side the Fuel Filler Is On Has Finally Been Found, Jalopnik.com, 8 October 2018 The use of the icon and arrow was invented in 1986 by Jim Moylan, a designer for Ford Motor Company. After he proposed the idea, the 1989 Ford Escort and Mercury Tracer were the first vehicles to see it implemented. Other automotive companies noticed the addition and began to incorporate it into their own fuel gauges. Aircraft Magnetoresistance type fuel level sensors, now becoming common in small aircraft applications, offer a potential alternative for automotive use. These fuel level sensors work similar to the potentiometer example, however a sealed detector at the float pivot determines the angular position of a magnet pair at the pivot end of the float arm. These are highly accurate, and the electronics are completely outside the fuel. The non-contact nature of these sensors address the fire and explosion hazard, and also the issues related to any fuel combinations or additives to gasoline or to any alcohol fuel mixtures. Magneto resistive sensors are suitable for all fuel or fluid combinations, including LPG and LNG. The fuel level output for these senders can be ratiometric voltage or preferable CAN bus digital. These sensors also fail-safe in that they either provide a level output or nothing. Systems that measure large fuel tanks (including underground storage tanks) may use the same electro-mechanical principle or may make use of a pressure sensor, sometimes connected to a mercury manometer. Many large transport aircraft use a different fuel gauge design principle. An aircraft may use a number (around 30 on an A320) of low voltage tubular capacitor probes where the fuel becomes the dielectric. At different fuel levels, different values of capacitance are measured and therefore the level of fuel can be determined. In early designs, the profiles and values of individual probes were chosen to compensate for fuel tank shape and aircraft pitch and roll attitudes. In more modern aircraft, the probes tend to be linear (capacitance proportional to fuel height) and the fuel computer works out how much fuel there is (slightly different on different manufacturers). This has the advantage that a faulty probe may be identified and eliminated from the fuel calculations. In total this system can be more than 99% accurate. Since most commercial aircraft only take on board fuel necessary for the intended flight (with appropriate safety margins), the system allows the fuel load to be preselected, causing the fuel delivery to be shut off when the intended load has been taken on board. Fuel Gauge ICs In electronics there are different ICs availablehttps://www.ti.com/power-management/battery-management/fuel- gauges/products.htmlhttps://www.maximintegrated.com/en/products/power/battery- management/battery-fuel-gauges.htmlhttps://www.st.com/en/power- management/battery-fuel-gauge.html, which control the current State of Charge of accumulators.

History=Origin Beginning in the second decade of the 19th century as an indigenous reform movement within the Armenian Apostolic Church, it developed into an independent community in 1846 in Istanbul to become known as the Armenian Evangelical Church and in subsequent decades registered a membership of 60,000 throughout the Ottoman Empire. After the First World War, when the Armenian population was devastated and the remnant deported from its historic homeland in what is now called Turkey, the Union was reorganized in Syria and Lebanon. The Union is composed of autonomous congregations. Its organizational pattern is a kind of modified congregationalism. The annual convention of the Union is the highest authority, presided by Rev. Megerdich Karageozian. The central committee of 12 members, elected at the convention, acts as an administrative body supervising and coordinating the activities of the member churches and church related institutions. From its inception, the Armenian Evangelical Church has stressed the importance of education. It now operates more than 20 schools, four of them being high schools and also owns the only university in the diaspora: Haigazian University, member of the Association of International Colleges and Universities-Europe Inc., with an enrollment of 650 students. It operates four conference centers in Syria, Lebanon, Iran and Turkey. Together with the Arabic-speaking Evangelical churches, the Union owns and operates a secondary school in Aleppo and the Near East School of Theology in Beirut (the latter also supported by foreign missionary agencies). With the Armenian Apostolic and Armenian Catholic Catholicossates it operates the old people's homes in Aleppo and Beirut, and a sanatorium in Azounieh, Lebanon. It has developed ecumenical ties with several churches and fraternal relations with the Armenian Evangelical Union of North America, the Armenian Evangelical Union of France and the Armenian Evangelical Union of Armenia. In spite of grave problems of emigrations and persecution, the Union continues to function with a growing awareness of its mission in its territories. The church is a member of the World Communion of Reformed Churches Establishment The Lebanon- based Armenian Evangelical Union of the Near East, established in 1924, is one of the oldest among the five Unions that comprise the Armenian Evangelical Church. It is a union of over two dozen churches and congregations in seven countries in the Middle East and one church in Australia, as the origin of the Sydney church is traced back to Lebanon and Syria. Each member church in the Union is independent in its internal affairs; however, certain Union-wide functions are centralized, such as the screening of candidates for the ministry. New recruits study at the Near East School of Theology, and at Haigazian University. Unlike those in other parts of the world, the Armenian Evangelicals in Lebanon, as part of the Evangelical Denomination of Lebanon [Taefa Protestant], are one of the officially recognized communities in the country‚Äôs sectarian political system. ‚ÄúThe Denomination has wide cooperation with the Armenian Evangelical community and is much closer to the Armenian milieu,‚Äù says Rev. Megerdich Karageozian, President of the Near East Union, ‚Äúbut legally and formally we are part of the Evangelical Denomination of Lebanon.‚Äù The Denomination is guaranteed one seat in the Lebanese Parliament. From 1972 to 2000s the ‚ÄúProtestant MP‚Äù had been an Armenian. In the past Antranik Manoogian, Nourjan Demirjian, and Abraham Dedeyan served as MPs; currently Edgard Traboulsihttps://www.lebaneseelections.com/results represents the interests of all the Evangelicals in Lebanon... ‚ÄúAn estimated five percent of Armenians in Lebanon are Evangelicals,‚Äù says Rev. Karageozian. ‚ÄúCurrently that is probably around 5-6,000 members.‚Äù Over the last two decades, thousands have left Lebanon depleting the human and financial resources of the church. Especially during the Lebanese Civil War, ‚Äú50 percent of our congregation emigrated,‚Äù says Rev. Karageozian. The Union closed two schools in Zahleh and Tripoli due to lack of students and difficult financial conditions and two other schools in Beirut; including The Armenian Evangelical Guertmenian School in 2015https://www.facebook.com/agertmenian1/posts/10153315754860033https://www.facebook.com/agertmenian1?ref=br_rs. But the community continues to educate around 1,350 students (as of 17/18 school year) in Four Secondary and One Middle School in Lebanon, with help from endowment fundshttps://amaa.org/sponsor-child-middle-east/. Before the beginning of the war, the Evangelical schools had more than 5,000 students in their schools. ‚ÄúThe economic well-being of the population has been disrupted because of the war and emigration.‚Äù He explains that the community expects the Union to provide scholarships and cover the cost of every student who attends their schools. ‚ÄúIn the past, a $100 scholarship meant a lot, but today an upper class student costs about $2000,‚Äù he explains. But the pride of the Armenian Evangelical Church is the Haigazian University, the only higher education institution in the Diaspora. http://oxbridgepartners.com/hratch/index.php/publications/articles/105-the- armenian-evangelical-union-of-the-near-east Presidents * Rev.

The men's national team are the Wallabies, who have won the Rugby World Cup twice, in 1991 and in 1999. The Wallabies play in Australia's traditional sporting colours of green and gold. They are considered one of the top rugby nations, owing to success at the World Cup and consistently high ranking, being ranked fifth in the world .Men's World Rugby Rankings at World Rugby, 21 August 2017 History= 19th century  NSW team, 1883. The Australia national team in 1899. The first rugby union club to be established in Australia was Sydney University's in 1864. In 1869, Newington College was the first Australian school to play rugby in a match against the University of Sydney. A decade after the first club was formed, a body called the Southern Rugby Union was formed as a result of a meeting at the Oxford Hotel in Sydney, At Trove a Sydney competition was established, which was administered from the England Rugby headquarters at Twickenham. The first competition commenced the following year in 1865 with 6 teams. The earliest record of rugby games being played in Queensland was in 1876. The 'Waratah' Rugby Club invited Australian rules football club, the Carlton Football Club to play two matches, one under rugby rules and one under Australian rules. On Saturday 23 June, 3,000 spectators watched Waratah beat Carlton at rugby at the Albert Cricket Ground in Redfern. In the return leg, Carlton defeated Waratah under Australian rules. The first inter-colonial game occurred on 12 August 1882, when players from the four Queensland clubs (who played both rugby and Australian rules football) travelled to NSW. NSW won by 28 points to 4 at the Association Ground (later to be renamed the Sydney Cricket Ground) in front of 4,000 spectators. Later that same year, the Southern Rugby Union undertook its inaugural tour of New Zealand, winning four of its seven matches. On 2 November, in 1883, the Northern Rugby Union was formed as the rugby body in Queensland after a meeting at the Exchange Hotel. As a result of the formation of the new body, several prominent grammar schools took up rugby as opposed to Melbourne Rules. The following year, a New Zealand party went to Australia and the first club competition was held in Queensland. In 1888 the Melbourne Rugby Union was formed in Victoria. In 1892, the rugby bodies in Australia dropped Southern and Northern from their titles, adopting New South Wales and Queensland respectively. That year the first British and Irish Lions tour was carried out. Although unsanctioned by official bodies in Europe, the 21-man squad went to both Australia and New Zealand. In 1899, the national team of Australia played their first match, and the Hospital's Cup became an annual competition in Queensland. 1900s to 1940s A rugby game in Queensland during the early 1900s. Toowoomba Grammar School Rugby Union Team, 1927. Australia played its first test against New Zealand in 1903 in front of a crowd of 30,000 at the Sydney Cricket Ground. In 1907, Australia again played New Zealand, at the same venue as the 1903 match, with crowd numbers reaching 50,000. This figure would not be surpassed again in Australian rugby union until after the game turned professional. The British Isles team visited Australia in 1904 and 1908, and at the 1908 Summer Olympics, the Australian team defeated England to win the gold medal in rugby. An event that was to greatly shape rugby union's future in Australia was the onset of World War I in 1914. Rugby competitions were suspended due to an overwhelmingly high percentage of rugby players enlisting to serve in the Australian Imperial Force. The enlistment of rugby players was so quick and extensive that, by 1915, a Sydney newspaper reported: \\"According to figures prepared by Mr W. W. Hill, secretary of the New South Wales Rugby Union, 197 out of 220 regular first grade players are on active service, or 90 percent.\\" Weakened by the loss of its players to the war effort, the Queensland Rugby Union was dissolved in 1919. It was not until 1928 that the union was re- formed and the Brisbane clubs and Great Public Schools returned to playing the rugby union code. In 1931, Charles Bathurst, 1st Viscount Bledisloe, as Governor of New Zealand, donated a sporting trophy called the Bledisloe Cup for competition between Australia and New Zealand. The first game was held that year at Eden Park, though the official start of the competition is disputed between that game and the 1932 New Zealand tour to Australia. Until the late 1940s, the administration of the Australian team, including all tours, was handled by New South Wales, being the senior union. A national body, the Australian Rugby Football Union was formed at a conference in Sydney in 1945, acting initially in an advisory capacity only, and in 1949 was formally constituted and joined the International Rugby Football Board (IRFB), representing Australia.  1980s to present  In 1987, the first ever Rugby World Cup was held in both Australia and New Zealand, as a result of both the respective rugby bodies putting forth the idea to the IRB. Australia was defeated by France in the semifinal stage. With rugby union becoming an openly professional sport in 1995, after more than a century of a professed amateur status, major changes were seen in both the club and international game. The Super 12 rugby competition was born that year. The tournament involved 12 provincial sides from three countries; New Zealand, South Africa and Australia. Australia entered three sides into the competition; ACT Brumbies, Queensland Reds and the New South Wales Waratahs. The year also saw the Tri Nations Series, between the three Super 12 countries. In 1999, the Bledisloe Cup match between Australia and New Zealand was staged at the Homebush Olympic Stadium, now known as ANZ Stadium. The game attracted a then world record crowd for a rugby union match of 107,042 to see Australia win with its greatest margin over New Zealand by 28‚Äì7. In 2000 this record was raised again when a crowd of 109,874 witnessed the 'Greatest ever Rugby Match'. New Zealand took an early lead of 24-nil after 11 minutes only to see Australia draw level at 24 all by half time, and the match was decided by a Jonah Lomu try to finish in favour of New Zealand by 39‚Äì35. The Wallabies were champions of the 1999 Rugby World Cup in Wales, claiming their second Webb Ellis Cup trophy. In doing this, Australia became the first multiple winners of the tournament. The year 2003 saw the staging of the Rugby World Cup in Australia. The fifth Rugby World Cup was held in various Australian cities from October to November in 2003. Matches were played all across the country, in Sydney, Brisbane, Melbourne, Canberra, Adelaide, Perth, Townsville, Gosford, Wollongong and Launceston. The tournament was hailed as a huge success, an estimated 40,000 international spectators travelled to Australia for the event, some estimations said that a $100 million may have been injected into the Australian economy. The Australian Rugby Union said that revenues exceeded all expectations, the tournament surplus was estimated to be at $44.5 million. The hosting of the World Cup in Australia also saw an increase in Super 12 crowds and junior participation. In 2005, to celebrate a decade of professional rugby union in Australia, the Wallaby Team of the Decade was announced. Organisation The Wallabies playing the New Zealand All Blacks. Rugby union in Australia is governed by Rugby Australia, which is a member of World Rugby (WR). There are constituent state and territory unions with the New South Wales Rugby Union and Queensland Rugby Union traditionally being the dominant members, reflecting the games higher status in these states. However, every state and territory in Australia is represented by their respective union, and in recent years, the ACT and Southern NSW Rugby Union has elevated itself to competitive equality with NSW and Queensland‚Äîthough not in governance, as NSW and Queensland have more representatives on the ARU board than the other state and territorial unions. Rugby Australia was formed in 1949 as the Australian Rugby Union; before this time the NSWRU was responsible for international fixtures for Australian teams. Rugby Union Players Association Past and present professional Australian rugby players are represented by the Rugby Union Players Association. Participation In 2009, figures from World Rugby (then the IRB) show there were just over 38,000 registered adult rugby union players in Australia, of which the states of New South Wales and Queensland accounted for 82.3% of all senior players. The highest participation rate was 0.8%, in the Australian Capital Territory. In NSW, major support comes from the private schools, which play union rather than league. In Sydney there are three major private school associations contributing the most support. These are the GPS, CAS and ISA, the major of these being the GPS schools, including The King's School, St Ignatius' College, Riverview and St Joseph's College, Hunters Hill. National teams=Wallabies The Wallabies is Australia's national rugby union team. Australia has won the World Cup on two occasions, in 1991 against England at Twickenham, and then again in 1999 in Wales against France. The team plays in green and gold, which have traditionally been Australia's sporting colours. Australia has been playing internationals since 1899, when they played a visiting British Isles team on 24 June, defeating them by 13 points to 3. The Wallabies play in the Southern Hemisphere's principal international competition. From 1996 through 2011, this was the Tri Nations, also involving the New Zealand All Blacks and the South Africa Springboks. Since 2012, the tournament has been renamed The Rugby Championship and features the Argentina Pumas. The rivalry with the New Zealand All Blacks is considered the marquee rivalry for the game of rugby union in Australia and the teams contest the Bledisloe Cup on an annual basis. The biggest crowd for a Bledisloe match was 109,874 in Sydney. Other rivalries that Australia once held such as games against England, Wales and France are now considered less relevant, aggravated by under-strength northern hemisphere teams touring Australia during Rugby World Cup years. Other representative teamsSevens= Australia also has a successful sevens team which competes in the World Rugby Sevens Series, Rugby World Cup Sevens and the Commonwealth Games. They have won the Hong Kong Sevens event on five occasions, and are also a \\"core team\\" that participates in all rounds of the Sevens World Series. The country has hosted one leg of the Sevens World Series in each season since 2006‚Äì07. From 2007 through 2011, the Adelaide Sevens was held in that city in March or April. Starting with the 2011‚Äì12 season, the Australian leg moved to the Gold Coast and was renamed the Gold Coast Sevens. In addition, the event moved to November, becoming the first tournament of each season. The tournament moved to October beginning in the 2012‚Äì13 season, but remained the season opener through 2014‚Äì15. Since the 2015‚Äì16 series, the event has been held in Sydney, and is now fourth on the series schedule. =Australia A= Australia A is a team of players who are being developed as future Wallaby players. They play matches against touring teams as well as compete in the Pacific Nations Cup. =Wallaroos= The women's team, the Wallaroos have been playing international rugby since 1994, and have competed at four Women's Rugby World Cups. Their best finish was third in 2010. =Women's Sevens= The women's sevens team were champions of the inaugural Women's World Cup Sevens in 2009. They have also been a core team in the World Rugby Women's Sevens Series since its inaugural 2012‚Äì13 season, and won the gold medal for inaugural Olympic sevens tournament at Rio de Janeiro in 2016. =Age-level representation= Australia also has an under 21 side, an under 20 side, an under 19 side and a schoolboys team. Competitions, tournaments and tours=International tournamentsRugby World Cup= Australia co-hosted the first Rugby World Cup, along with New Zealand in 1987. It acted as host for the second time in 2003. Australia has won twice, in 1991 and 1999. =Tri Nations and The Rugby Championship= The Tri Nations Series was an annual tournament held between Australia, New Zealand, and South Africa from 1996 through 2011. With Argentina's entry into the tournament in 2012, the competition has been renamed The Rugby Championship. =Bledisloe Cup= The Bledisloe Cup is a trophy introduced by the Governor General of New Zealand, Lord Bledisloe, in 1947 to honour the rivalry between New Zealand and Australia. The Cup is awarded to the winner of each annual series of test matches played. Matches played at Rugby World Cups do not count towards the competition. =End-of-year tests= The Australian rugby team annually plays a test series against other squads, either at home acting as host nation to visiting teams, or touring overseas.  Rugby's domestic presence in Australia When Australia became one of the world's best sides in the 1980s, the team was largely drawn from the NSW Waratahs and Queensland Reds. The ACT Brumbies had become another strong province by the 1990s and joined the Super 12 competition with the Waratahs and Reds in 1996, playing against the top rugby provinces from New Zealand and South Africa. The Western Force, based in Perth, joined the competition in 2006 when it expanded to become the Super 14, and the Melbourne Rebels were added when it became Super Rugby in 2011. The strongholds of the game are still in New South Wales and Queensland where rugby football, initially rugby union and later rugby league, has been the dominant code since the 1880s. Rugby was introduced to other cities and regions at around the same time but Melbourne rules (now Australian football) was preferred in the southern states. Rugby union had a diminished national profile for many decades after rugby league became the more popular football code in Sydney and Brisbane prior to the first world war. The game gradually expanded its reach again after the second world war, and rugby union was re- established in most areas of the country by the 1970s, however rugby league is by far the more dominant code in NSW, Victoria and Queensland. = Super Rugby = Super Rugby, previously known as Super 12 and Super 14, is a multi- regional rugby union competition that involves teams from three nations across the southern hemisphere; Australia, New Zealand and South Africa, and expanded in 2016 to also include teams based in Argentina and Japan. Australia had five sides in the 15-team competition (which expanded to 18 in 2016): the Queensland Reds, New South Wales Waratahs, Brumbies (playing out of Canberra), Western Force and, since 2011, the Melbourne Rebels. The Brumbies have won the competition twice, the Reds and Waratahs once. Prior to the creation of professional Super Rugby in 1996, there were a number of other Oceania-African competitions that featured representative teams from both Queensland and New South Wales, such as the Super 10 competition, which Queensland won twice. Before that there was the Super Sixes competition. State teams have been playing each other since the late 1800s, when Queensland took on New South Wales in Sydney. The Australian Provincial Championship (APC) was also played in 2006, featuring the Australian Super 14 teams. =National Rugby Championship= In late 2013, Rugby Australia (then known as the Australian Rugby Union) announced plans to launch a new domestic competition to be known as the National Rugby Championship (NRC) with the goal of bridging the gap between club rugby and Super Rugby. Originally expected to involve 10 teams, and ultimately unveiled in March 2014 with nine teams, the NRC began play in August 2014, with the season running through to November. The inaugural NRC teams included four in NSW, two in Queensland and one each in Canberra, Melbourne and Perth. After the 2016 season, one of the NSW teams was dropped from the competition and was replaced by the Fijian Drua, an effective developmental side for the Fiji national team. The country's previous attempt to launch a national domestic competition came in 2007 in the form of the Australian Rugby Championship (ARC). It included eight teams in all, with a geographic distribution almost identical to that of the first three seasons of the NRC, with the exception of one fewer NSW team. The aim of the competition, scheduled to run from August finishing in October with the final, was similar to that of the NRC. The ARU scrapped the competition for the 2008 season due to the union suffering an A$4.7 million loss. =Club competitions= Each major city and many country areas support club rugby competitions in Australia. The club competitions in NSW and Queensland are the oldest and most prestigious. The NSWRU runs the Shute Shield, the highest level in New South Wales along with also running the NSW Country Championships played by regional representative teams from country areas in NSW. Similarly the QRU runs the Queensland Premier Rugby competition, which is the top Brisbane club competition, as well as the Queensland Country Championships for representative teams in the major regions of greater Queensland. All other states also run their own club competitions of varying strength, but the NSW and Queensland competitions have historically been regarded as the major domestic competitions below Super Rugby and are now the major level below the NRC.

They liked the view that Dr. Spurr holds about how to spend time in the holidays: he believes in the three 'R's - rest, revision, reflection. In 2004 Spurr stated that A-level exams may fail talented pupils, especially in the Humanities; and Westminster consequently switched to Cambridge Pre-U exams in 9 subjects, which he described as \\"so much more stimulating to teach and learn\\" and a much better preparation for study at university.G.

While working for Inspired, he also came to appreciate the value of the IB curriculum. From 2006-2013 Spurr was the Chairman of ISEB, the board that produces and regulates the Common Entrance examination, where he always insisted on breadth of knowledge, academic integrity and rigour. According to Tatler magazine, Spurr also believes in academic research for its own intrinsic sake.Tatler Schools Guide 2013 At Eton, Clifton and Westminster, he consistently looked to identify and encourage academically ambitious pupils in the state sector, through extensive fund-raising for bursary programmes and by establishing the Eton-Harlesden Summer School in 1986, the Clifton Summer School in 2001 and, in his last year as Head Master at Westminster, he set up the Harris-Westminster Sixth Form Academy,The Times: Top public school offers pupils from poor backgrounds academy route to Oxbridge a joint project between Westminster School and the Harris Federation, which opened in 2014 and was judged Outstanding in its first Inspection by Ofsted.

D√©lvid√©k (, \\"southern land\\" or \\"southern territories\\") is a historical political term referring to varying areas in the southern part of what was the Kingdom of Hungary. In present-day usage, it often refers to the Vojvodina region of Serbia. In the Middle Ages, like the names Alvid√©k (\\"lower land\\") and V√©gvid√©k (\\"borderland\\"), D√©lvid√©k referred to the Hungarian counties (Ver≈ëce, Pozsega, Szer√©m, B√°cs, Toront√°l, Temes, Keve) and vassal banates (Macs√≥, √ìzora, S√≥, Sz√∂r√©ny) beyond the Danube and the Sava. By the 18th and 19th centuries, D√©lvid√©k referred only to B√°cska and Banat. After the 1920 dismemberment of Hungary, the meaning was further narrowed to only those areas of the former Kingdom of Hungary attached to the newly formed Yugoslav state. In the Second World War, the Yugoslav areas occupied and annexed by Hungary (Baƒçka, part of Baranja, Meƒëimurje, and Prekmurje) were in some Hungarian sources called \\"az anyaorsz√°ghoz visszat√©rt d√©lvid√©ki ter√ºletek\\" (\\"the southern territories returned to the motherland\\"). Banat, divided between Romania and German-occupied Serbia was no longer considered part of the concept. In contemporary usage, D√©lvid√©k has several uses. It can refer to the imprecisely defined area of Serbia's northern Pannonian Basin including Vojvodina, the Belgrade region, and the Maƒçva plain as well as eastern Croatia (Baranja and western Syrmia). Sometimes the term is used (especially by irredentist) in the narrow sense of Vojvodina, although it has largely been replaced by Vajdas√°g, the Hungarian name for Vojvodina. \\"D√©lvid√©k Hungarians\\" (d√©lvid√©ki magyarok) can refer to Hungarians in Vojvodina or, in a larger sense, to both the Vojvodina Hungarians and Hungarians of Croatia.

Personal life Lydia Lassila (n√©e Ierodiaconou) was born 17 January 1982 in Melbourne, Australia. She is of Greek-Cypriot and Italian descent. Her mother is Italian and her father Cypriot.Lydia Lassila bio@ NBC Olympics Lassila completed her primary schooling at Our Lady of the Immaculate Conception Primary School in Sunshine, Victoria, and completed her secondary education at Methodist Ladies' College, Melbourne and Westbourne Grammar School. She completed a bachelor's degree in Applied Science (Human Movement) at RMIT University. She is married to Lauri Lassila, a Finnish former professional freestyle skier, whose career included placing 2nd in moguls at the FIS Freestyle Skiing World Championships in 1999. She gave birth to her first son in 2011 after winning Gold at the 2010 Vancouver Winter Olympics. Her second son was born in 2015 after the 2014 Sochi Winter Olympics where she claimed bronze. Career In June 2005, Lassila suffered a ruptured anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) and underwent radical knee reconstruction in which a cadaver's achilles tendon was grafted into her knee to replace her damaged ACL. This allowed for a faster recovery and a swift return to the slopes in time for the start of the 2006 Winter Olympic Games in February. During the second qualifying round of the Torino aerials competition, Lassila's knee collapsed on impact after she attempted to land a difficult jump, re-rupturing her ACL and forcing her to withdraw. However, taking inspiration from compatriots and teammates Jacqui Cooper and Alisa Camplin, both of whom have suffered similar knee injuries, the then 24-year-old Lassila vowed to return to the sport when she recovered. Lassila made her comeback to World Cup competition 16 months later in China in December 2007, collecting a silver medal in her first event. She ended the 2007/08 season ranked second in the World Cup standings, and then went on to win her first World Cup title in the following 2008/09 season. 2010 Winter Olympics At the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver, Lassila won gold in the aerials, getting Australia's second gold medal for the games after snowboarder Torah Bright won gold in the halfpipe, also at Cypress Mountain. This medal was also the second gold for an Australian in the aerials at all Winter Olympic Games, after Alisa Camplin in 2002. There was a lot of pressure and hype from the Australian press for Lassila to do well as world number one. She was in second position after the first jump of the final, before posting the highest scoring second round jump. The leader after the first jump, Xu Mengtao, had the last jump, but scored more than 25 points below Lassila's second jump to fall down the rankings into sixth, due to a failed landing. Lassila had a combined score of 214.74, beating second placed Li Nina with 207.23 points. Australian team-mates Jacqui Cooper and Elizabeth Gardner finished 5th with 194.29 and 12th with 86.70 respectively.  2014 Winter Olympics  Lassila achieved a Bronze medal in the Freestyle Skiing Women's Aerials event. Her jump was a quad-twisting triple somersault. If she had 'landed' it she would have been the first woman to do so, but she landed hard and 'slapped' down on her back on landing. Her score for the aerial was 72.12. Lassilas' prior jumps were scored at 95.76 and 99.22. Return to competition At the beginning of 2017, Lassila returned to competition in a bid to return to the Winter Olympics for 2018. On 3 February 2017 she won her first World Cup event since 2014, clinching a close fought victory ahead of Kiley McKinnon (USA) and Xu Mengtao (CHN) at Deer Valley. She then went on to obtain the second and the third World Cup wins at the end of February in Minsk and in the beginning of March 2017 in Moscow.  Awards  Apart from her sporting medals, Lassila has also received other honours and awards: * 2010 Australian Institute of Sport 'Athlete of the Year' * 2010 Sport Australia Hall of Fame, 'The Don' Award * 2010 Governor's Award for the Victorian Sportsperson of the Year * 2010 Victorian Female Athlete of the Year- Kitty McEwan Award * 2010 Ski and Snowboard Australia Athlete of the Year Film/Television Lydia is the subject of a feature documentary film called The Will To Fly that chronicles her life and sport pursuits. The film was released in Australia in 2016 to much critical acclaim. The international release is intended for 2017. Australian Survivor In 2018, Lassila appeared as a contestant on Australian Survivor: Champions vs. Contenders, competing in the fifth season of the competitive reality television series Australian Survivor as part of the Champions tribe. In the beginning of the game, Lassila dominated in challenges, winning for her tribe in many instances. Lassila made very strong relationships in the game, notably with fellow contestants Mat Rogers and Shane Gould. Come the merge, Lassila was seen as a physical threat by many contestants and was voted out in 12th place. In 2020, Lassila returned to appear on Australian Survivor: All Stars, being eliminated via a fire challenge against opposing tribe member Phoebe Timmins on Day 18.

They were in the power classification 1F. Early withdrawals Six locomotives - nos. 271/9, 1007/31/52/3 - were withdrawn from service between 1903 and 1905. Fifty more were sold in 1906 to the Italian State Railway, Ferrovie dello Stato (FS), where they formed FS Class 380; they had been ordered by one of the constituents of the FS, the Rete Mediterranea. They were meant to fill a gap of valid locomotives after the nationalization of the Italian railways, and therefore were not thought to remain in service for more than a few years; however, some of them remained active into the 1920s. Numbering After the Midland Railway's 1907 renumbering scheme, the numbers were: * 2592‚Äì2671, 2674‚Äì2711 and 2713‚Äì2867 Numbers 2672/3 were members of the 480 Class; no. 2712 was a member of the 240 Class, which had been given a number in the wrong series as the result of a clerk's error.

The remainder went to France at various dates in 1917 before being returned to the MR in 1919‚Äì20. All returned to service with the MR except 2765 which was scrapped at Derby in 1920 having suffered broken frames during its time with the ROD. One engine, 2717, was cut off in No man's land during the Battle of Cambrai in November 1917 and was subsequently captured by the German army during Operation Michael. The Germans salvaged the engine and used it on their military railway in the Brussels area. Recovered after the war, the engine was returned to the MR.

Since viruses are obligate intracellular parasites they must develop direct methods of transmission, between hosts, in order to survive. The mobility of animals increases the mechanisms of viral transmission that have evolved, whereas plants remain immobile and thus plant viruses must rely on environmental factors to be transmitted between hosts. Natural transmission between plant hosts The structural differences between plant and animal cells have resulted in a variety of transmission routes being exploited, enabling the virus to be passed between different host plants. The main difference, from the point of view of a virus, is the cell wall. This forms a tough barrier between the intracellular components and the extracellular environment, which has to be penetrated. These differences, combined with the fact that plants are immobile, have resulted in plant viruses relying on the wind and soil to transmit seeds as well as vectors. Vectors either transmit the virus propagative transmission, which results in an amplification of the virus by replication within the cells of the vector, or non-propagative transmission which simply carries the virus between the plants without viral replication. Common vectors include Bacteria, Fungi, Nematodes, arthropods and arachnids. Furthermore, human intervention, including grafting and experimental mechanical damage, physically damages the cell wall, contributes to the array of transmission routes. The virus commonly uses these methods to be passed from one host to another. However, the virus is dependent upon physical damage, generated naturally by the wind and feeding of vectors or by human intervention. Transmission between plant cells Viral infections often develop into systemic infections as a means of transmission. The virus often infects many tissues, if not the whole plant, where it can continue to replicate. There are a variety of methods the virus can use to spread throughout the organism but the most common route use the vascular system, otherwise known as the xylem and phloem, and the plasmodesmata, which interconnect adjacent cells. Nevertheless, the rigidity of the cell wall of plant cells, not only poses a problem for transmission of the viruses between different plant hosts, but also acts to prevent viral transmission between cells. Consequently the virus must modify the plasmodesmata as they, themselves, are too large to fit through the small and tightly regulated plant structure. There are again a variety of mechanisms used for this, which have evolved for different viruses. The main mechanisms involve expressing proteins which coat the virus and interact with the structure of the plasmodesmata. The array of proteins expressed by the different viruses may act differently but all achieve a similar goal, passage between adjacent cells.

History The Near East School of Theology, formed in 1932 by the merger of the School for Religious Workers in Beirut and the School of Religion in Athens, is built upon a history of evangelical theological education in the Near East which goes back to 1835. In that year, Rev. William Thompson, later the author of The Land and the Book, founded in Beirut the first Protestant Seminary in the area. In 1843 the Seminary moved to Abey, in the mountain not far south of Beirut, under the leadership of Dr. Cornelius Van Dyck, translator of the Bible into Arabic. It offered classes in both theology and general education. Out of the Abey Seminary grew, in 1866, the Syrian Protestant College, now the American University of Beirut. With the founding of the College, it was decided that the seminary pursue only theological studies, while the College be responsible for general studies. The Seminary had several locations in the subsequent years and, in 1905, moved back to Beirut . In 1912, under Principal F. E. Hoskins, Colton Hall ‚Äì a gift of Mr. Milton Colton of Jenkintown, Pennsylvania ‚Äì was constructed on a piece of land near the center of the city and became the home of the N.E.S.T. until 1971. In the meantime, as early as 1839, theological education was being offered in the area which is now Turkey, under the leadership of the Rev. Cyrus Hamlin, of the American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions, in Bebek and later in Marzifoon, Marash and Harput. However, because of the events which befell the Armenian population in the Ottoman Empire during World War I, these seminaries were closed and consolidated in the establishment of the School of Religion in Istanbul, with the Rev. Fred Goodsell as President. After the catastrophe of Izmir in 1922, the Armenian and Greek students of the School, together with Professor Loutfi Levonian, moved to Athens. In 1925, the Istanbul branch of the school was closed and the institutions were combined in the School of Religion in Athens. In 1930, missionaries in the Near East, seeking to strengthen theological education in the area, proposed to unite the theological institutions in Athens and Beirut . In the spring of that year, after a period of negotiations between the Syria Mission (Presbyterian) and the Near East Mission (Congregational), an agreement was reached for the two schools to merge and form the new Near East School of Theology in Beirut. The merger was consummated on November 11, 1932, with Gaius Greenslade as Principal and Loutfi Levonian as Dean. Following World War II, the two American Boards were joined by the National Evangelical Synod of Syria and Lebanon, the Union of the Armenian Evangelical Churches in the Near East (1945), the Diocese of Jerusalem of the Episcopal Church (1950) and the Lutheran Church in Jordan (1967). In 1971, the School moved to its new home: a modern, well equipped building, two blocks to the south of the American University of Beirut in Ras Beirut. The credit for this considerable achievement must go above all to the late President Hovhannes Aharonian, who, from 1959 and until his retirement in 1978, presided over the destiny of the School, and had served in other capacities for many years prior to that. On the occasion of his retirement, the Reverend Aharonian was named Honorary President. The events of recent years in Lebanon have left their mark on the whole society and on every institution in the country. The N.E.S.T. too was adversely affected, especially through the loss of teaching faculty and the reduction of the student body to a third of its pre-war size. Nevertheless, the School was able to keep its doors open all through the troubles and is now attempting to rebuild its student body and to reach out in new directions. The first sign of this renewal is perhaps the revised curriculum for all degree programs which is included in this catalog, and was implemented as of October, 1991. The new curriculum is an attempt at updating the course offerings and the requirements in the various degree programs so as to meet the changes in the situation of the churches in this region, as well as to keep in line with the ecumenical renewal in theological education worldwide. Profile The NEST is an undergraduate and graduate theological seminary of some 40 students and seven full and two part-time faculty. The seminary offers the following programs: B.A. in Christian Education; B.Th. with emphasis in pastoral studies; B.Th. in Christian Education; M.A.C.E., a graduate program for educational ministries; M.Div. for Pastoral ministry; S.T.M., a post graduate research degree; and the S.T.M. in Ministry established jointly with McCormick Theological Seminary in Chicago. The seminary is housed in a modern building with classrooms, offices, faculty and student lounges, dining facilities, sanctuary and chapel, coffee shop, dormitory rooms for 50 students, six faculty apartments and a gymnasium and theater which are under construction. The library contains 42,000 volumes in Arabic, Armenian, English, French and German. Church relationship The NEST is under the auspices and support of four mainline Protestant Evangelical churches in the Middle East, the National Evangelical Synod of Syria and Lebanon, the Union of the Armenian Evangelical Churches in the Near East, the Episcopal Church in Jerusalem and the Middle East of the Anglican Communion, and the Evangelical Lutheran Church in Jordan and the Holy Land. These four local churches jointly sponsor the N.E.S.T. and enjoy the full cooperation and support of Associate Members, all of whom are represented on the Board of Managers.

Writing down the invariants during the programming process has a number of advantages: it requires the programmer to make their intentions about the program behavior explicit before actually implementing it, and invariants can be evaluated dynamically during execution to catch common programming errors. Furthermore, if strong enough, invariants can be used to prove the correctness of the program based on the formal semantics of program statements. A combined programming and specification language, connected to a powerful formal proof system, will generally be required for full verification of non-trivial programs. In this case a high degree of automation of proofs is also possible. In most existing programming languages the main organizing structures are control flow blocks such as \`for\` loops, \`while\` loops and \`if\` statements. Such languages may not be ideal for invariants-first programming, since they force the programmer to make decisions about control flow before writing the invariants. Furthermore, most programming languages do not have good support for writing specifications and invariants, since they lack quantifier operators and one can typically not express higher order properties. The idea of developing the program together with its proof originated from E.W. Dijkstra. Actually writing invariants before program statements has been considered in a number of different forms by M.H. van Emden, J.C. Reynolds and R-J Back.

The Trust is supported by contributions from local sponsors, individuals, families, businesses and organisations.  History  The concept for the Northland Emergency Services Trust was conceived at a public meeting called at the request of the Auckland Surf Club in 1988. The meeting discussed the idea of having a rescue helicopter in Northland for three months over the summer period. Joyce Ryan, who was the Mayor of Whangarei at the time, asked those present if they thought the money that was being asked for, to run the service for three months, seemed fair. After discussion, the St John contingent said: ‚ÄúWe can do the same job for the same money, but for the whole year.‚Äù Since then, NEST transported the first patient on Tuesday 15 November 1988 and has since carried more than 20,000 passengers. In 1988, when NEST began, its first emergency helicopter was a Bell 206 ‚Äì which is a basic single pilot, one engine and one patient rescue helicopter. In 1991, the Bell Jet Ranger was replaced with a more powerful Eurocopter Squirrel emergency helicopter and in 1994 the Squirrel was replaced with a twin-engine MBB/Kawasaki BK 117. In 1997, the first Sikorsky S-76 emergency helicopter was acquired, the fleet has expanded to include a total of 5 rescue helicopters.  Helicopters  NEST currently operate 5 Sikorsky S-76 helicopters (known as Helimed-1, Helimed-2 and Helimed-3, Helimed-4, Helimed-5) in Search and Rescue, Medevac, and Hospital transfer roles from its base at St John's ambulance centre, adjacent to Kensington Park. There have been several helicopter upgrades since the formation of NEST in 1988, including a Bell 206B Jetranger, a Eurocopter Squirrel, and a MBB/Kawasaki BK 117. The Northland Rescue Helicopter has a longer range (3hrs 10mins standard or 5hrs 30mins with a spare tank fitted), is faster (155 knots) and has more room inside than any other rescue helicopter in New Zealand. Its operational range covers a radius of 270 km from its base, making it suitable for all of Northland, extending south beyond Auckland, and offxshore work. The helicopters are set up to allow two pilots, two patients on horizontal stretchers and four medical support staff to occupy the cabin.  Fundraising  Funds for NEST are collected through annual appeals, sponsored by Northpower and Top Energy.

He was dubbed the \\"Poet of the Nile\\", and sometimes the \\"Poet of the People\\", for his political commitment to the poor. His poetry took on the concerns of the majority of ordinary Egyptians, including women‚Äôs rights, poverty, education, as well as his criticism of the British Empire and foreign occupation. He was one of several Egyptian poets who revived Classical Arabic poetry during the latter half of the 19th century. While still using the classical Arabic system of meter and rhyme, these poets wrote to express new ideas and feelings unknown to the classical poets. Hafez is noted for writing poems on political and social commentary. Early life Hafez was born in 1871 in Dayrut, in Egypt. His father was an Egyptian engineer and his mother was Turkish. After his father‚Äôs death, at the age of four, Hafez was sent to live with his maternal uncle in Tanta where he received his primary school education. He then moved to Cairo to live with his mother and an uncle, where he completed his secondary education. After his mother died, Hafez moved back to Tanta and worked alongside Egyptian Nationalist lawyer Mohamed Abou Shadi; here, he discovered numerous literary books and became familiar with prominent leaders of the Egyptian National Movement. Career In 1888, Hafez attended the Military Academy and graduated three years later as a lieutenant. He was then appointed by the Ministry of Interior, and, in 1896, he was deployed to Sudan as part of Egypt‚Äôs Sudan campaign. There, Hafez and several of his colleagues were involved in a rebellion against the mistreatment of the Sudanese, whereupon Hafez was court-martial-ed and sent back to Egypt. By 1911 Hafez was appointed the head of the literary section in the Dar al Kutub al Masriyah (the Egyptian National Library), and the Minister of Education bestowed upon him the title \\"Bey\\" which provided Hafez with financial stability. Thereafter, he began to devote more time to literature and poetry. Hafez joined a circle of neo-classical artists of modern Arab poetry, such as Ahmad Shawqi and Mahmoud Samy El Baroudy, in imitating the Arabic classical writing style of meter and rhyme. Works Many poems were written by Hafez, for example: *Albas≈´ka al-dimƒÅ æ fawq al-dimƒÅ æ, ÿ£ŸÑÿ®ÿ≥ŸàŸÉ ÿßŸÑÿØŸÖÿßÿ° ŸÅŸàŸÇ ÿßŸÑÿØŸÖÿßÿ° (They've dressed you in blood upon blood).poems *YƒÅ sayyidƒ´ wa imƒÅmƒ´, Ÿäÿß ÿ≥ŸäÿØŸä Ÿà ÿ•ŸÖÿßŸÖŸä (O master and imam). *Shakartu jamƒ´l ·π£un øikum, ÿ¥ŸÉÿ±ÿ™ ÿ¨ŸÖŸäŸÑ ÿµŸÜÿπŸÉŸÖ (I've thanked your favor). *Ma·π£r tatakallam  øan nafsihƒÅ, ŸÖÿµÿ± ÿ™ÿ™ŸÉŸÑŸÖ ÿπŸÜ ŸÜŸÅÿ≥Ÿáÿß (Egypt talks about herself). *Lƒ´ kasƒÅ æ an øam bihi min kasƒÅ æ, ŸÑŸä ŸÉÿ≥ÿßÿ° ÿ£ŸÜÿπŸÖ ÿ®Ÿá ŸÖŸÜ ŸÉÿ≥ÿßÿ° (I've a dress, and what an excellent dress). *Qul li-l-ra æƒ´s adƒÅma AllƒÅh dawlatahu,ŸÇŸÑ ŸÑŸÑÿ±ÿ¶Ÿäÿ≥ ÿ£ÿØÿßŸÖ ÿßŸÑŸÑŸá ÿØŸàŸÑÿ™Ÿá (Tell the President that God has extended the life of his state). * Translation of Les Mis√©rables by Victor Hugo, 1903Abdellah Touhami, √âtude de la traduction des Mis√©rables (Victor Hugo) par Hafiz Ibrahim, Universit√© de la Sorbonne nouvelle, 1986 Memorials There is a statue of Hazef, sculpted by Faruq Ibrahim, on the Gezira Island.

Administrative divisions, constituencies and people There are twenty-one wards in the district, which is divided into two parliamentary constituencies: Binga North Constituency with twelve wards and South Binga Constituency with nine wards. The separate constituencies were created in 2008. Joel Gabuza is MP for Binga South while Prince Dubeko Sibanda presides over Binga North. Among the areas in Binga North Constituency are: Chizarira, Siabuwa, Cheete, Siansundu, Siantula, Mujere and Manjolo. Settlements The town of Binga , is the largest settlement. It lies on the south eastern shore of Lake Kariba. Most of it was constructed to rehouse the BaTonga people whose homeland was flooded by the creation of the Kariba reservoir in the late 1950s. The Chibwatatata Hot Springs lie near the town at what is known as Rest Camp area. It is a prime tourist area and was previously a shrine for local Tonga people under the leadership of one Maalila. Maalila was possessed by mpande (muzimu wamvula). He led rainmaking ceremonies at the hot springs. There are also settlements under the following areas and chiefs: Economy and development Binga District is a rural district that is significantly underdeveloped, with only gravel roads, which are car hostile especially during the rainy season. It is also one of the most sparsely populated districts of the country. Binga District is famous for its growing of cannabis, known locally as dagga or mbanje. The consumption of cannabis in the Binga District has been described as traditional since pre-colonial times, and is considered by people from without to be an integral part of the Tonga culture. However, it must be pointed out that consumption of cannabis is often considered a devious pursuit especially, since 1955, in light of federal laws to control the importation, exportation, production, possession, sale, distribution and use of dangerous drugs, despite its use as a traditional medicine. There is a wrong impression among people from the rest of Zimbabwe that people from Binga are legally entitled to plant, harvest, process and smoke cannabis freely. ;Stereotypes against Tonga people Recently, the ministry of primary and secondary education of Zimbabwe has been caught offside following the publication of a secondary level textbooks for the new subject of Total Heritage Studies. It was immediately gathered that some of the contents was seen as reinforcing stereotypes held against Tonga people. For instance, the authors Mashaar S and BB Matseketsa plagiarized Tongan Kingdom courtship and passed it as Zimbabwe Tonga culture without verification and in another section they insinuate that Tonga culture accepts incest as a marriage enhancing activity. All this had been disputed by Tonga people and many have seen the new subject and content as carelessly written or is meant promote Shona supremacy. While the issue is still undergoing debate, indications are that Tonga people will petition the Permanent Secretary in the ministry of education for the retraction of the approved textbook and allowing native Tonga input.

In his teens, Bompa played competitive soccer and competed in sprint and pentathlon. After an ankle injury, he swapped to rowing, which he found difficult as it is an endurance sport rather than a strength sport that he had been used to through his track and field career. At the 1958 European Rowing Championships, he won a silver medal in the coxed four event. He attended the courses of the Institute of Physical Culture and Sports, a prestigious sports academy in the Romanian capital city, Bucharest, which he graduated at the age of 24, in 1956. Between 1956 and 1970, he served as Director of the Central Army House Sports Club, as an assistant professor at the Polytechnic Institute of Timi»ôoara and the University of Bucharest, and as Athletic Director at Politehnica Timi»ôoara Sports Club. Starting in 1960, he laid the foundations of new training methods for performance athletes, which were first published in the journal \\"Studies and Research\\" Politehnica University of Timi»ôoara. In 1970 Bompa emigrated to Canada, where he attended Masters studies at York University, in Toronto, between 1972 and 1974. In 1975 enrolled in the doctoral studies program at State University of New York at Buffalo, graduating with a Ph.D. degree in 1979 with thesis \\"Mechanical analysis of the action of the arms\\". He was also conferred a Ph.D. degree by the Free University of Brussels, in Belgium.

It was designed for competition use and based on the M-Type Midget. A special car, EX120 had been developed from the M-Type for George Eyston to make an attempt on the 750 cc class 24-hour record at Autodrome de Montlh√©ry in France. The attempt was successful and a series of replica cars were made which became the C-Type. The car used a tuned short- stroke (73 mm) version of the bevel gear driven overhead camshaft engine from the 1928 Morris Minor and Wolseley 10 with a single SU carburettor and a new crankshaft producing at 6400 rpm. It could from 1932 be had with the crossflow head to be seen later on the MG J-type and a Powerplus supercharger version was also available with at 6500 rpm. Drive was to the rear wheels through a four-speed non-synchromesh gearbox. The chassis was new and took the form of a ladder frame with tubular cross members and passed under the rear axle. The suspension used half-elliptic springs and Hartford friction shock absorbers with rigid front and rear axles and centre lock wire wheels. The car had a wheelbase of 81 inches (2057 mm) and a track of 42 inches (1067 mm). The body, which had no doors, was metal over an ash frame and had a pointed tail which held the spare wheel and cycle type front wings. Later cars had a more conventional rear with a slab-type fuel tank. The exhaust pipe was routed outside the car and finished with a spectacular fishtail. The record-breaking cars had a streamlined cowl over the radiator, but this was not usually fitted to later cars as it could cause overheating unless high speeds were maintained. The standard car initially cost ¬£295 or ¬£345 for the supercharged version, rising to ¬£490 and ¬£575 by the end of production. As well as the Montlh√©ry record, C-Types were used in many other competition events including a works team of fourteen cars entered in the 1931 Double Twelve event at Brooklands, where they took the first five places.

Born in Broni, he was a long-time Christian Democrat. He became leader of Forza Italia's group in the regional assembly of Lombardy in 2005. In the 2008 general election he was elected to the Chamber of Deputies, where he sat in the group of The People of Freedom.  Political Career  Abelli started his political career in the 70s as part of the Christian Democratic Party of Lombardy. In 1974 he became the president of the San Matteo Policlinic in Pavia. In the 90s, after the break-up of the Christian Democratic Party, Abelli joined Forza Italia and became close with the Communion and Liberation movement and with Roberto Formigoni, who entrusted him with running the regional healthcare as President of the Healthcare Commission of the Lombardy Region.Gianni Barbacetto, \\"Abelli detto il Faraone\\", Il Fatto Quotidiano, 22 ottobre 2009 Between 1996 and 1997 Abelli received a bribe of 72 million lire from Giuseppe Poggi Longostrevi who was later involved in the main scandal of corruption of Lombard healthcare. Abelli was the head of Forza Italia regional council in Lombardy from 2005. He was also the commissioner of the regional Family and Social Solidarity, though he was mainly connected with the healthcare system and Communion and Liberation. In his regional political role, Abelli was a great sponsor of the Broni-Pavia-Mortara autostrada project which was launched in 2002 and which raised objections from local committees and associations. In the 2008 Italian general election Abelli was elected to the Chamber of Deputies in the People of Freedom group. He was the third candidate on the Lombardia 1 electoral college list, directly following Berlusconi and Fini. In August 2008 Berlusconi nominated Abelli commissioner of the South Tyrol section of Forza Italia to take the party to provincial elections.  Private Life and Legal Incidents  Abelli was married to Rosanna Gariboldi (Lady Abelli) who was the councillor of Internal Organisation in the Pavia province. Gariboldi was the business partner of Massimo Ponzoni, who was regional councillor for the Environment, Massimo Buscemi, who was regional councillor for Network and Utility Services, and Giorgio Pozzi, the ex-councillor for Innovation and Craftsmanship. Together, these four held the majority of the Lux ad Sidera society, which was involved in property speculation in the province of Varese on land sold by Canossian nuns. In October 2009 Gariboldi was arrested and detained in the San Vittore Prison of Milan together with the businessman Giuseppe Grossi, in the context of investigating black market funds created from the reclamation of the Milano Santa Giulia area. On the account marked \\"Associates\\", opened by Gariboldi at the Bank J. Safra Sarasin in Montecarlo, and for which Abelli also acted as attorney, almost 2.4 million euro had been transferred by Grossi and his fiduciaries. These were then in part returned with further transfers to Swiss banks. On other accounts owned by the couple in Montecarlo other deposits of hundreds of thousands of euro showed up, their origins uncertain.Peter Gomez, \\"Choc lottizzazione, trema la Milano bene\\", Il Fatto Quotidiano, 21 ottobre 2009 On the 12th of January 2010 Gariboldi negotiated two years of imprisonment with a suspended sentence and she was let out of San Vittore prison after three months of detention and agreed to pay 1.2 million euro, which came from the laundering the ex-commissioner was accused of.

Biography Fabrizio Cicchitto entered politics during the earlier 1960s, supporting the Marxist left wing of Riccardo Lombardi in the Italian Socialist Party and then becoming secretary of the party's youth organization (Federazione Giovanile Socialista Italiana, Italian Young Socialist Federation). Cicchitto also became sympathetic to Eurocommunism and the Historic Compromise path taken by the Italian Communist Party (PCI), while being highly critical of Christian Democracy (DC) itself, as well as of the American CIA and the Italian Servizio Informazioni Difesa. According to him, DC would have taken profit from the Red Brigades' activities and the Aldo Moro case to cut off relations with the PCI. In 1981, he confessed being a member of the masonic lodge Propaganda Due (P2). Shortly after this move, Cicchitto was excluded from the Socialist Party. Readmitted toward the end of the Eighties, he followed the policies of Bettino Craxi and held minor posts throughout the Mani pulite-Tangentopoli scandals that saw the disestablishment of most Italian political parties. Cicchitto joined Silvio Berlusconi's centre-right party Forza Italia, leading its social-democratic wing We Blue Reformers. He had been a Socialist member of either the Italian Chamber of Deputies or the Italian Senate for three successive terms. He is currently the vice-president of Forza Italia's group in the Chamber, and national deputy- coordinator of the party from 2003. He has contributed to steps taken by Italy in its adoption of the European Monetary System and the Maastricht Treaty, and has taken part in debates over privatization in the country. Since 1998, Cicchitto contributes editorials to Il Giornale, and is currently a member of the editorial staff for Avanti!. In November 2009 he founded Reformism and Freedom (REL), a \\"reformist\\" and mainly social-democratic think tank within The People of Freedom (PdL). After the split of PdL, Cicchitto joined the New Centre-Right party.

A Draft Implementation Guide for version 4.0 of eCTD was released in August 2012. However, work stalled on the project. An additional Draft Implementation Guide was released in February 2015 Draft specifications and guides were issued in April 2016 by the ICH and the FDA, followed by a May 13 ICH \\"teleconference to discuss the guidance and any questions and clarifications needed.\\" U.S. On May 5, 2015, the U.S. Food & Drug Administration published a final, binding guidance document requiring certain submissions in electronic (eCTD) format within 24 months. The projected date for mandatory electronic submissions is May 5, 2017 for New Drug Applications (NDAs), Biologic License Applications (BLAs), Abbreviated New Drug Applications (ANDAs) and Drug Master Files (DMFs). E.U. The E.U. and its European Medicines Agency began accepting eCTD submissions in 2003. However, in February 2015, the \\"EMA announced it would no longer accept paper application forms for products applying to the centralized procedure beginning 1 July 2015.\\" The EMA verified on that date that it would no longer accept \\"human and veterinary centralised procedure applications\\" and that all electronic application forms would have to be eCTD by January 2016.  China  In Nov 2017, China Food and Drug Administration (CFDA) publishes draft eCTD structure for drug registration for public consultations. This is a big transition for China to move from paper submission to eCTD submissions. Governing specifications An eCTD submission's structure is largely defined by the primary standard created by the ICH, the Electronic Common Technical Document Specification. However, additional specifications may be applied in national and continental contexts. In the United States, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) layers additional specifications onto its requirements for eCTD submissions, including PDF, transmission, file format, and supportive file specifications. In the European Union, the European Medicines Agency's EU Module 1 specification as well as other QA documents lay out additional requirements for eCTD submissions.  Pharmaceutical point of view  right The eCTD has five modules: # Administrative information and prescribing information # Common technical document summaries # Quality # Nonclinical study reports # Clinical study reports A full table of contents could be quite large. There are two categories of modules: * Regional module: 1 (different for each region; i.e., country) * Common modules: 2‚Äì5 (common to all the regions) The CTD defines the content only of the common modules. The contents of the Regional Module 1 are defined by each of the ICH regions (USA, Europe and Japan).  IT point of view = eCTD (data structure)  The eCTD is a message specification for the transfer of files and metadata from a submitter to a receiver. The primary technical components are: * A high level folder structure (required) * An XML \\"backbone\\" file that provides metadata about content files and lifecycle instructions for the receiving system * An optional lower level folder structure (recommended folder names are provided in Appendix 4 of the eCTD specification) * Associated document type definitions (DTDs) and stylesheets. Each submission message constitutes one \\"sequence\\". A cumulative eCTD consists of one or more sequences. While a single sequence may be viewed with web browser and the ICH stylesheet provided, viewing a cumulative eCTD requires specialized eCTD viewers. The top part of the directory structure is as follows: ctd-123456/0000/index.xml ctd-123456/0000/index-md5.txt ctd-123456/0000/m1 ctd-123456/0000/m2 ctd-123456/0000/m3 ctd-123456/0000/m4 ctd-123456/0000/m5 ctd-123456/0000/util The string ctd-123456/0000 is just an example. = Backbone (header) = This is the file \`index.xml\` in the submission sequence number folder. For example: ctd-123456/0000/index.xml The purpose of this file is twofold: * Manage meta-data for the entire submission * Constitute a comprehensive table of contents and provide corresponding navigation aid. = Stylesheets = Stylesheets that support the presentation and navigation should be included.

The phrase was most commonly used by the first Prime Minister of Singapore, Lee Kuan Yew, and other leaders of his political party, the People's Action Party (PAP), to refer to Malay extremists. However, it was also used by some members of the United Malays National Organisation (UMNO) -- the leader of the Alliance coalition governing Malaysia -- to refer to Lee instead, as Lee was perceived to be a Chinese chauvinist himself. History Lee was the first to use the phrase \\"ultras\\" in 1964, when he publicly demanded that UMNO's leadership \\"Smack down their ultras.\\" This was barely a year after Singapore had merged with Malaya, Sabah, and Sarawak to form a united Malaysia, and this profoundly troubled the UMNO leadership. It is not clear where Lee got the idea of labeling Malay chauvinists as \\"ultras\\", but it is possible that he may have obtained it from a student's Ph.D. thesis. In 1960, Lee served on a three-man panel that evaluated Gordon Paul Means' Ph.D. thesis, entitled \\"Malayan Government and Politics in Transition\\". On one page of his copy of the manuscript, Lee had reportedly underlined in thick pencil the word \\"ultra\\" and placed an exclamation mark over it.Sopiee, Mohamed Noordin (1976). From Malayan Union to Singapore Separation: Political Unification in the Malaysia Region 1945 - 65, p. 194. Penerbit Universiti Malaya. . Chauvinists Some of the perceived Malay \\"ultras\\" were Syed Jaafar Albar, once the UMNO Secretary-General, Syed Nasir Ismail, a strong advocate of expanding the scope of the Malay language in Malaysian society, Mahathir bin Mohamad, then a UMNO Member of Parliament and future Prime Minister of Malaysia, and Musa Hitam, another UMNO MP who would later serve as Mahathir's deputy.Customer Service, University Tunku Abdul Rahman Library (2005). \\"Universiti - Perlukah sebuah lagi?\\" . Retrieved Feb. 14, 2006. What these men had in common was their perceived support of ketuanan Melayu, or Malay supremacy (although these exact phrases were then not in vogue). Syed Jaafar Albar had campaigned strongly for the Singaporean branch of UMNO in the 1963 Singaporean general election, and made heated statements condemning Malay PAP politicians as un-Islamic, anti-Malays, and traitors to their community. Othman Wok, a senior Malay PAP politician, later insinuated Syed Jaafar's rhetoric had set the stage for the 1964 Race Riots in Singapore.Goh, Jenny (July 23, 1997). Small spark can create big mess . Straits Times. Syed Nasir Ismail had insisted on closing down all Chinese schools in Malaysia as soon as possible, making Malay the sole official language.Lee, Hock Guan (2001). \\"Political Parties and the Politics of Citizenship and Ethnicity in Peninsular Malay(si)a, 1957-1968\\" . Retrieved Feb. 22, 2006. Mahathir was a strong proponent of strengthened affirmative action for the Malays, and reportedly demanded (together with Syed Nasir Ismail and Syed Jaafar Albar) a one-party Malay-only government led by UMNO in the wake of the May 13 racial riots in Kuala Lumpur, the Malaysian capital.Alatas, Syed Farid (2002). \\"ISLAM, DEMOCRATIZATION AND CIVIL SOCIETY IN INDONESIA AND MALAYSIA\\". Retrieved Feb. 22, 2006. He would later author The Malay Dilemma, which contended that the Malays as the \\"definitive people\\" of Malaysia had a birthright guaranteeing them special privileges such as those outlined by Article 153 of the Constitution of Malaysia. Musa, who was closely associated with Mahathir, thus became also associated with Mahathir's \\"ultra\\" approach to politics.Means, Gordon P. (1991). Malaysian Politics: The Second Generation, p. 22. Oxford University Press. . Both would later be expelled from UMNO by then Prime Minister and UMNO President Tunku Abdul Rahman after Mahathir's reaction to the May 13 riots. Then Home Minister Ismail Abdul Rahman would issue an explanation of the decision where he stated: \\"These ultras believe in the wild and fantastic theory of absolute dominion by one race over the other communities, regardless of the Constitution.\\" Means, p. 10. Musa and Mahathir would later be rehabilitated by the Tunku's successor, Tun Abdul Razak. In some cases, Lee also would refer to media outlets as \\"ultras\\"; he once criticised the Utusan Melayu as \\"their [the ultras'] newspaper\\".Sopiee, p. 201. Ironically, Lee himself would later be considered an \\"ultra\\" by the Alliance government for some of the statements he made; on May 24, 1965, Lee publicly stated: \\"Let us be quite frank. Why should we go back to old Singapore and once again reduce the non-Malays in Malaya to a minority?\\" Sopiee, p. 204. His Malaysian Malaysia campaign was not received well either by UMNO or most of the Malays, who tended to view a Malaysian Malaysia as a \\"Chinese Malaysia\\". It has been speculated that this was due to the limited vocabulary of Malay at the time; the only Malay word for \\"nation\\" then was \\"bangsa\\", which was also synonymous with race. Since there was (and is) no \\"Malaysian race\\", it has been argued that most Malays considered anything other than a \\"Malay nation\\" as threatening to their rights.Sopiee, p. 203. The conflict between Lee and his Chinese-majority PAP with the Malaysian government culminated in the secession of Singapore from Malaysia in 1965. Reduction in usage in 1970s The usage of the phrase \\"ultra\\" declined greatly in the 1970s, not long after the May 13 riots of 1969. This may have been due to strong restrictions on making potentially incendiary declarations in public; even Parliament was banned from discussing the repeal of certain articles of the Constitution, such as Article 153, which touched on Malay rights.Means, pp. 14-15. Due to this, the political atmosphere cooled down, which may have indirectly contributed to the decline in usage of \\"ultra\\" to describe racial chauvinists.

Here he seems to test Akhenaten to shame him into sending gold or perhaps just to gauge the extent of his potential military reach. International relations Louvre.

A Neo-Babylonian copy of a literary text which takes the form of a letter,≈†utruk-Na·∏´·∏´unte (?) to Kassite court, Tablet VAT 17020 CDLI now located in the Vorderasiatisches Museum in Berlin, is addressed to the Kassite court by an Elamite King.

This may have been Napir-asu, whose headless statue (pictured) now resides in the Louvre in Paris. It is likely that Suppiluliuma I, king of the Hittites, married yet another of Burna Buria≈°‚Äôs daughters, his third and final wife, who thereafter was known under the traditional title Tawananna, and this may have been the cause of his neutrality in the face of the Mitanni succession crisis. He refused asylum to the fleeing Shattiwaza, who received a more favorable response in Hatti, where Suppiluliuma I supported his reinstatement in a diminished vassal state. According to her stepson Mursili II, she became quite a troublemaker, scheming and murderous, as in the case of Mursili‚Äôs wife, foisting her strange foreign ways on the Hittite court and ultimately being exiled.

A tablet provides an exhortation to Enlil and a brick refers to work on the great socle of the Ekiur of Ninlil in Nippur.

A cylinder inscription of NabonidusCylinder BM 104738, column I, lines 49 to 52. recalls Burna-Buria≈°‚Äô earlier work on the temenos at Sippar: There are around 87 economic texts, most of which were found at successive excavations in Nippur, providing a date formula based on regnal years, which progress up to year 27. Many of them are personnel rosters dealing with servile laborers, who were evidently working under duress as the terms Z√Å·∏§, \\"escapee\\", and ka-mu, \\"fettered\\", are used to classify some of them. Apparently thousands of men were employed in construction and agriculture and women in the textile industry. An oppressive regime developed to constrain their movements and prevent their escape. Other texts include two extispicy reports provide divinations based on examination of animal entrails. Nippur seems to have enjoyed the status of a secondary capital. The presence of the royal retinue replete with scribes would have provided the means for the creation of business records for the local population. Kara-·∏´arda≈°, Nazi-Buga≈° and the events at the end of his reign Later in his reign the Assyrian king A≈°≈°ur- uballi·π≠ I was received at the Egyptian court by Tutankhamen, who had by then ascended the throne. This caused a great deal of dismay from Burna-Buria≈° who claimed the Assyrians were his vassals, \\"Why have they been received in your land? If I am dear to you, do not let them conclude any business. May they return here with empty hands!\\" on EA 9. Finally released from beneath the yoke of Mitanni hegemony, Assyria emerged as a great power during his reign, threatening the northern border of the kingdom. Perhaps to cement relations, Muballi·π≠at-≈†ƒìr≈´a, daughter of A≈°≈°ur-uballi·π≠, had been married to either Burna- Buria≈° or possibly his son, Kara-·∏´arda≈°; the historical sources do not agree. The scenario proposed by Brinkman has come to be considered the orthodox interpretation of these events. A poorly preserved letter in the Pergamon Museum possibly mentions him and a princess or mƒÅrat ≈°arri.Tablet VAT 11187 published as KAV 097 CDLI, line 1: [ka-ra-] ·∏´ar-da-a≈°, and 3: a-ma DUMU MUNUS MAN di-mu. Kara-·∏´arda≈° was murdered, shortly after succeeding his father to the throne, during a rebellion by the Kassite army in 1333 BC. This incited A≈°≈°ur-uballi·π≠ to invade, depose the usurper installed by the army, one Nazi- Buga≈° or ≈†uziga≈°, described as \\"a Kassite, son of a nobody\\", and install Kurigalzu II, \\"the younger\\", variously rendered as son of Burnaburia≈°The Synchronistic Chronicle (ABC 21), K4401a, Column 1, line A16. and son of Kada≈°man-·∏™arbe, likely a scribal error for Kara-·∏´arda≈°.Chronicle P (ABC 22), tablet BM 92701, line 14 Note, however, that there are more than a dozen royal inscriptions of Kurigalzu II identifying Burna-Buria≈° as his father.

Biography Lucio Piccolo, also known as Baron Lucio Piccolo di Calanovella, was first-degree cousin to Giuseppe Tomasi di Lampedusa, the author of The Leopard. He endowed himself with a vast library and mastered the major languages of the European literary tradition, while living a life of relative solitude. In 1954, aged 50, he published in a private edition a \\"plaquette\\" containing nine lyric poems which he mailed to Eugenio Montale. The postage costs were grossly underestimated by the sender (35 lire), and to take possession of the book, Montale had to make up the difference by paying a further(150 lire). Montale, impressed by the high quality of Lucio Piccolo's poetry, with which he was unfamiliar invited him to participate in the San Pellegrino Literary Meeting. His works were published that year as Canti barocchi e altre liriche (\\"Baroque Chants\\"). His intention, he wrote to Montale, was to capture the world and atmosphere of Palermo's churches and convents, and the case of mind of people associated with them, before the memory of them, fast fading, died completely.Gioco a Nascondere, Canti Barocchi, introduced by Eugenio Montale, Arnoldo Mondadori (1960) 1967 p.106.

Originally an RAF station, the original accommodation areas have now been converted to become the headquarters and training centre of the Ministry of Defence Police. It started as RAF Station Wethersfield opening in 1944 and during World War II it was used by the Royal Air Force and United States Army Air Forces. It was closed in 1946, and was reopened in 1951 as a result of the Cold War. Used until 1970 as a United States Air Force fighter airfield, it was held as a reserve airfield until 1993, when it came under control of the Ministry of Defence Police. History=Use by the USAAF RAF Wethersfield was allocated by the RAF to the United States Army Air Forces Ninth Air Force in August 1942. For security reasons, it was known as USAAF Station AAF-170 rather than its location during the war. Its station ID was \\"WF\\" but it was still RAF Wethersfield. =416th Bombardment Group (Light)= The 416th Bombardment Group (Light) arrived from Laurel Army Airfield, Mississippi, USA on 1 February 1944, flying the twin-engine Douglas A-20G \\"Havoc\\" aircraft. Its operational squadrons and fuselage codes were: * 668th Bombardment Squadron (5H) * 669th Bombardment Squadron (2A) * 670th Bombardment Squadron (F6) * 671st Bombardment Squadron (5C) On 21 September the 416th moved to their Advanced Landing Ground at Melun/Villaroche France (A-55). On the continent, the 416th BG used the following Advanced Landing Grounds: * A-55 at Melun/Villaroche, France: 21 September 1944 * A-69 at Laon/Athies, France: February 1945 * A-59 at Cormeilles-en-Vexin, France: May ‚Äì July 1945 The group returned to the United States in July 1945 and was inactivated at Camp Myles Standish, Massachusetts, on 23 October 1945. Use by the RAF Bomber Command 50px RAF World War II Short Stirling bomber Soon after the Americans departed for France, Wethersfield was returned to RAF control, becoming the home for 196 and 299 Squadrons, 38 Group, RAF Bomber Command. During the late 1940s the base was used as a winter camping ground for Chipperfield's Circus. Elephants were housed in the maintenance hangars and the huts became homes for other circus animals. Use by the USAF20th Fighter Bomber / Tactical Fighter Wing= 50px In 1951, as a result of the Cold War threat of the Soviet Union, the British provided RAF Wethersfield to the USAF as part of their NATO commitment. Work on upgrading the facilities at Wethersfield commenced that same year. The United States was rapidly expanding its air force, increasing the number of combat wings from 48 in 1950 to 95 by June 1952. The 20th Fighter-Bomber Wing was transferred from Langley AFB in Virginia, USA and took up residence at RAF Wethersfield on 31 May 1952. The transfer was intended to address the defence problem posed by Soviet conventional superiority in Western Europe. The 20th FBW consisted of three operational squadrons: the 55th, 77th, and 79th Fighter-Bomber Squadrons, flying the F-84G \\"Thunderjets\\". The F-84Gs were specially equipped to carry small nuclear bombs, and could deliver these weapons on Soviet forces if they invaded West Germany. Due to restricted space at Wethersfield, the 79th Squadron was initially stationed at RAF Bentwaters from 6 June 1952, then at RAF Woodbridge, southeast of Bentwaters, from 1 October 1954.

Republic F-84F-45-RE Thunderstreak, Serial 52-6703 of the 55th Fighter-Bomber Squadron. This aircraft was retired from USAF service in 1955 and sold to the new West German Air Force. Later, this aircraft served in the Greek Air Force. RAF Woodbridge was operated as a detachment of the 20th FBW until 8 July 1958, when the 20th FBW/TFW handed over control to the 81st Tactical Fighter Wing. The 79th TFS remained at the base under the control of the 20th TFW until 1970. In June 1955 the 20th FBW started receiving the F-84F \\"Thunderstreak\\" in addition to its F-84Ds and F-84Gs. The F-84G was phased out by June 1955, with the aircraft being transferred to Allied nations in Europe and the Middle East. The 20th flew the F-84F until 16 June 1957 when the conversion to the North American F-100D and F-100F \\"Super Sabres\\" began. The F-100 remained the primary aircraft at RAF Wethersfield until 1970. The 20th Fighter Bomber Wing established an operational detachment at Wheelus AB, Libya, in February 1958. This detachment managed the USAFE Weapons Training Center for month-long squadron rotations by the Europe-based USAFE tactical fighter wings. F-100D Super Sabre of 20 TFW in 1964 showing unit markings in colour The 20th began realigning its units 15 March 1957 as part of an Air Force worldwide reorganization. Combat groups were inactivated, assigning the unit's fighter mission to the wing. As part of another organization change, the 20th dropped the \\"Fighter Bomber\\" designation on 8 July 1958, becoming the 20th Tactical Fighter Wing. The three flying units also changed designation, becoming tactical fighter squadrons. The flying squadrons were dispersed on a monthly rotational basis to RAF Alconbury, RAF Woodbridge, and Nouasseur AB, Morocco, due to runway repairs at Wethersfield from May to August 1958. Starting in July 1966, bases in Turkey, Spain, and Italy were transferred from Tactical Air Command to USAFE. USAFE was responsible for deploying fighter squadrons to these bases. The 20th began monthly rotations of its fighter squadrons to Cigli AB, Turkey, starting in July 1966. Rotations to Aviano AB, Italy, began in December 1966. Rotations to Zaragoza AB, Spain, began in January 1970. Rotations to all these bases continued until June 1970. The closure of US bases in France forced the opening of RAF Greenham Common under 20th TFW management to handle personnel overflow beginning in January 1967. A military coup in Libya forced the closure of the range at Wheelus AB in September 1969 and the closure of the 20th TFW's detachment in Libya. The range was relocated to Torrejon AB, Spain, in November 1969. On 10 December 1969, Detachment 1, 20th Tactical Fighter Wing was established at RAF Upper Heyford as part of congressional budget cutbacks and a USAFE-wide base realignment and consolidation of units. RAF Wethersfield had a limited potential for development and was close to the expanding London Stansted Airport. The fighter squadrons of the 20th had been in constant rotation since the arrival of the wing at Wethersfield in 1952. As part of budget reductions and to consolidate all of the wing's elements at a larger facility, the 20th Tactical Fighter Wing was relocated from Wethersfield to RAF Upper Heyford, replacing and absorbing the 66th Tactical Reconnaissance Wing, which had relocated from Laon AB, France, to the UK on 1 June 1970. The aging 1950s-era F-100s of the 20th TFW and RF-101 \\"Voodoos\\" of the 66th TRW were retired, and were replaced by the General Dynamics F-111E Fighter-Bomber at RAF Upper Heyford. =66th Combat Support Squadron= 75px The 66th Tactical Reconnaissance Wing at RAF Upper Heyford was inactivated and elements were moved to RAF Wethersfield. As a result, became a Dispersed Operations Base until September 1970, when the airfield mission was changed to that of Standby Deployment Base, ready to support augmentation forces if directed. In October 1970, elements, primarily Civil Engineering, of the inactivated 66th TRW were moved to RAF Wethersfield, being designated the 66th Combat Support Group. The group was again re-designated 66th Combat Support Squadron and became the host unit at RAF Wethersfield. The 66th CSS performed whatever duties were necessary to keep the airfield in a usable, operational state. On 1 June 1985 the 66th was reactivated as the 66th Electronic Combat Wing at Sembach AB, West Germany. =10th Tactical Reconnaissance Wing= 75px In August 1976 the 66th CSS became Detachment 1, 10th Tactical Reconnaissance Wing (TRW), based at RAF Alconbury. Under the 10th TRW, the station became a satellite of RAF Alconbury, storing much of the 10th TRW's War Reserve Material assets in its hangars. In addition, the 10th TRW supported a number of units including the 819th Civil Engineering Squadron Heavy Repair (CESHR) and Det. 1 2166th Information Systems Squadron (later redesignated Det. 1 2166th Communications Squadron). =819th RED HORSE SQUADRON= 75px In 1978 the British and American Governments agreed to establish a Rapid Engineer Deployable Heavy Operational Repair Squadron Engineers (RED HORSE) unit in the UK. The main RED HORSE Civil Engineering unit established in December 1978 was the 819th CES. The 7119th Air Base Flight, later designated the 7119th Support Group, was established to manage the personnel and organisational issues for units at RAF Wethersfield. The 819th was tasked with rapid runway repair responsibilities for US Air Forces in Europe, along with its usual heavy repair role. RAF Wethersfield, circa 1979 As the American involvement in the Vietnam War wound down, the role of RED HORSE units in peacetime came into question. As the need still existed for a quick-acting heavy repair force integral to the USAF Air Force and responsive to USAF commanders, a variety of training programs were developed, including civil engineering projects to develop skills similar to those required during a contingency. In 1980 members of the 819th removed and re- installed seven bells and a bell cage in an 11th-century church in Finchingfield, Essex. The goodwill generated in the village, located a mile from RAF Wethersfield, resulted in enhanced housing and community support for USAF personnel. The 819th, along with the 2166th Communications Squadron, were the main units at Wethersfeld until the USAF returned the base to the British in 1990 due to budget cutbacks. The 819th was inactivated in February, while the 2166th remained active until June 1992. The base was handed back to the Royal Air Force at a ceremony on 3 July 1990 and Wethersfield was once again placed under care and maintenance status. The USAF retained a small Military Family Housing area at Wethersfield, in which American personnel assigned to RAF Molesworth, RAF Alconbury, and RAF Upwood lived. Current use 75px On 6 June 1982 No. 614 Volunteer Gliding Squadron RAF moved to MDP Wethersfield from RAF Debden, as that base was required for tank training. The squadron currently operates Grob Viking TX.1 gliders, maintaining a fleet of between six and eleven gliders. The squadron's headquarters is located in one of the two remaining T2 hangars. The gliders are used to provide members of the Air Cadet Organisation with gliding experience, plus qualifications such as gliding scholarships and advanced glider training are available. In addition to the Viking TX.1s, the squadron operates four Land Rover Defenders, a Lamborghini tractor, and two Van Gelder six drum trailer type winches. The squadron consists of 40 to 60 personnel who annually conduct around 6,000 launches, producing more than 800 hours of air time. In April 1991, the Chief Constable of the Ministry of Defence Police (MDP) assumed responsibility for the site. A small, joint civilian-uniformed team was established to oversee the refurbishment of a number of buildings to prepare for the relocation of the Ministry of Defence Police Training School and Firearms Training Wing from Medmenham, Buckinghamshire, and the headquarters from Earl's Court in London by March 1993. The Training Centres commenced operation on 1 April 1993. The Operational Support Unit moved to Wethersfield from RAF Wittering and has been permanently based there since May 1992. In addition, Wethersfield was to be the home for the MOD Guard Service (MGS) Training School. The move in October 1994 of the MDP training and headquarters, along with the MGS Training Wing, gave the Force its first combined HQ and Training Centre. Hangars at MDPGA Wethersfield Gardiner Associates, a fire investigation training provider, began providing residential fire investigation training courses for police, fire and forensic science practitioners at MDP Wethersfield in 2000. Millbrook Engineering uses Wethersfield as its \\"Extreme Manoeuvre Facility\\", which they describe as a \\"high security location for extreme dynamics evaluation and driver training with the world's largest on and off-road vehicles.\\" All three wartime-era runways and connecting taxiways, as well as many wartime loop-type dispersal hardstands, remain in good condition. The post-war jet runway laid down for USAF fighters during the 1950s and 1960s is still intact. The large main hangar, used by the USAF until the facility was closed, is well maintained, as are numerous buildings and Nissen huts used by the MOD Police. In late March 2016, the Ministry of Defence announced that the site was one of ten to be sold in order to reduce the size of the Defence estate. The disposal date was later extended to 2025.

It is a private oratory of Trinitarian bishops dating from the turn of the 6th century. Although commonly attributed to St. Peter Chrysologus, Archbishop of Ravenna from 433-450, the chapel was actually built by Peter II shortly after he became archbishop in 495. The mosaics date from the original construction, or soon after. Description The tiny cruciform chapel is currently dedicated to Saint Andrew, although the original dedication was to the Saviour, as evidenced by a lunette over the vestibule door representing Christ treading on the beasts, dressed as a general or victorious Emperor. The lower parts of the walls are lined with marble slabs, while the rest of the interior used to be covered with rich, tapestry-like mosaics, as the vault still is. Some parts of these survive, while others were substituted with tempera paintings by Luca Longhi in the 16th century.

Periodization or Peaking at the right time, in: Track Technique 54 (1973), pp.1720- 1724 It involves progressive cycling of various aspects of a training program during a specific period. Conditioning programs can use periodization to break up the training program into the off-season, preseason, inseason, and the postseason. Periodization divides the year round condition program into phases of training which focus on different goals. History The roots of periodization come from Hans Selye's model, known as the General adaptation syndrome (GAS). The GAS describes three basic stages of response to stress: (a) the Alarm stage, involving the initial shock of the stimulus on the system, (b) the Resistance stage, involving the adaptation to the stimulus by the system, and (c) the Exhaustion stage, in that repairs are inadequate, and a decrease in system function results. The foundation of periodic training is keeping one's body in the resistance stage without ever going into the exhaustion stage. By adhering to cyclic training the body is given adequate time to recover from significant stress before additional training is undertaken. The response to a new stress is to first respond poorly and the response drops off. For example, when the body is first exposed to sun a sunburn might develop. During the resistance stage adaptation improves the response to a higher level, called super compensation, than the previous equilibrium. The example would be that a suntan develops. The exhaustion stage is a continuation of the stimulus at too high a level and the increase gained from adaptation is now offset and all gains are lost. The example would be that wrinkles, spots, or even skin cancer develop. The goal in sports periodization is to reduce the stress at the point where the resistance stage ends so the body has time to recover. In this way the exhaustion stage does not reduce the gains achieved, the body can recover and remain above the original equilibrium point. The next cycle of increased stimulus now improves the response further and the equilibrium point continues to rise after each cycle. Selye (1957) labeled beneficial stresses as \\"eustress\\" and detrimental stresses as \\"distress\\". In athletics, when physical stress is at a healthy level (eustress), an athlete experiences muscular strength and growth, while excessive physical stress (distress) can lead to tissue damage, disease, and death. Periodization is most widely used in resistance program design to avoid over-training and to systematically alternate high loads of training with decreased loading phases to improve components of muscular fitness (e.g. strength, strength-speed, and strength- endurance). The Selye-cycles are similar to the \\"micro cycles\\" used at later times. Russian physiologist Leo Matveyev and Romanian sport scientist Tudor Bompa expanded and further organized the periodization model. Matveyev has been regarded as the father of modern periodization. He analysed the results of the Soviet athletes of the 1952 and 1956 summer Olympics and compared successful and not so successful athletes and their training schedules. From these training plans periodized schedules were developed for the 1960 Olympics. With the success of the Soviet athletes, Matveyev's plans were spread all over the Eastern Bloc in their annual coordination meetings. From there it also spread to Romania, where Tudor Bompa developed the system further. In the 1968 it was used for the first time in the GDR and in 1972 in West Germany.Arnd Kr√ºger. Nachwort zum neusten Stand der Literatur zur Periodisierung, in: L. P. MATWEJEW: Periodisierung des sportlichen Trainings. Berlin: Bartels & Wernitz 1972, 201 - 231 (2. Aufl. 1978). Also basis for the French translation: Postface.La base de l'entra√Ænement.Paris: Vigot 1980. After the fall of the Soviet Union, periodization started to become modified. While Matveyev followed Pavlov and assumed that everybody should use the same periodization, individualised systems, using more and more biological data, were introduced.V.I. PLATONOV: General theory of training of athletes in Olympic sports. Kiew: Olympic Books, 1997. Periodic training systems typically divide time up into three types of cycles: microcycle, mesocycle, and macrocycle. The microcycle is generally up to 7 days. The mesocycle may be anywhere from 2 weeks to a few months, but is typically a month. A macrocycle refers to the overall training period, usually representing a year or two. There are longer cycles as well for the Olympian, being 4 or 8 years, and the career plan which is usually only considered for Olympians and professional athletes. Theory of planning Training should be organized and planned in advance of a competition or performance. It should consider the athlete's potential, their performance in tests or competition, and calendar of competition. It has to be simple, suggestive, and above all flexible as its content can be modified to meet the athletes rate of progress. The macrocycle A macrocycle is an annual plan that works towards peaking for the goal competition of the year. There are three phases in the macrocycle: preparation, competitive, and transition. The entire preparation phase should be around 2/3 to 3/4 of the macrocycle. The preparation phase is further broken up into general and specific preparation of which general preparation takes over half. An example of general preparation would be building an aerobic base for an endurance athlete such as running on a treadmill and learning any rules or regulations that would be required such as proper swimming stroke as not to be disqualified. An example of specific preparation would be to work on the proper form to be more efficient and to work more on the final format of the sport, which is to move from the treadmill to the pavement. The competitive phase can be several competitions, but they lead up to the main competition with specific tests. Testing might include any of the following: performance level, new shoes or gear, a new race tactic might be employed, pre-race meals, ways to reduce anxiety before a race, or the length needed for the taper. When the pre-competitions are of a higher priority there is a definite taper stage while lower priority might simply be integrated in as training. The competitive phase ends with the taper and the competition. The transition phase is important for psychological reasons, a year of training means a vacation is in order. A typical weekend warrior might take three months while a professional athlete might take as little as two weeks. The mesocycle A mesocycle represents a phase of training with a duration of between 2 ‚Äì 6 weeks or microcycles, but this can depend on the sporting discipline. A mesocycle can also be defined as a number of continuous weeks where the training program emphasize the same type of physical adaptations, for example muscle mass and anaerobic capacity. During the preparatory phase, a mesocycle commonly consists of 4 ‚Äì 6 micro-cycles, while during the competitive phase it will usually consist of 2 ‚Äì 4 micro-cycles depending on the competition's calendar. The goal of the plan is to fit the mesocycles into the overall plan timeline-wise to make each mesocycle end on one of the phases and then to determine the workload and type of work of each cycle based on where in the overall plan the given mesocycle falls. The goal in mind is to make sure the body peaks for the high priority competitions by improving each cycle along the way. The microcycle A microcycle is typically a week because of the difficulty in developing a training plan that does not align itself with the weekly calendar. Each microcycle is planned based on where it is in the overall macrocycle. A micro-cycle is also defined as a number of training sessions, built around a given combination of acute program variables, which include progression as well as alternating effort (heavy vs. light days). The length of the micro-cycle should correspond to the number of workouts - empirically often 4-16 workouts - it takes for the athlete or fitness client to adapt to the training program. When the athlete or fitness client has adapted to the program and no longer makes progress, a change to one or more program variables should be made. The annual plan The annual plan is important in that it directs and guides performance training over a year. It is based on the concept of periodization and the principles of training. The objective of training is to reach a high level of performance (peak performance) and an athlete has to develop skills, biomotor abilities and psychological traits in a methodical manner. Preparatory phase This phase consists of the general preparation and specific preparation. Usually which can be subdivided into three different phases. One should always remember that this is a base creation phase with the objective to attain the previous training state, and the longest period of periodization must be devoted towards the preparatory period. The performance depends on preparatory period, and is divided into three phases: Phase I) To regain previous training *competitions. Phase II) Low training volume & High training load to develop the factors needed for performance. *works on specific exercise. Phase III) Decrease in the intensity of load and increase in tactical training and aim at improving tactical under competition condition. Competitive phase This phase may contain a few main competitions each containing a pre-competitive and a main competition. Within the main competition, an uploading phase and a special preparatory phase may be included. Transition phase This phase is used to facilitate psychological rest, relaxation and biological regeneration as well as to maintain an acceptable level of general physical preparation. This phase lasts 3‚Äì4 weeks (perhaps longer) but should not exceed five weeks under normal conditions and may be sports specific. It allows the body to fully regenerate so that it is prepared for the next discipline. *there is no competition in this phase. Opposition to periodization A review published in the journal 'sports medicine' in 2017 has questioned the validity of the use of traditional models of periodization in sport. This is largely due to the oversimplified assumptions put forward in the early development of periodization theory that are not always transferable to the psycho-biological effects of various training methods used in sport. Periodization has been questioned due to it being viewed as reductionist/deterministic. In coaching in particular it is oversimplified and doesn't take into account the true nature of coaching which is viewed as a dynamic, chaotic and forever changing environment. Periodization fails to consider the athlete, coach and the context of the coaching taking place. The improvement of an athlete or a team in sports varies depending on an individual's hormonal response, genetic predispositions, motivation, stress levels, as well as transient social and environmental variables. Periodization is suggested to be the optimum method of sports training when aiming to enhance team performance due to the organisational and structural nature to its approach. Kiely (2012) states periodization provides benefits such as providing idealized training structures, times frames to progress athletes and therefore development and retention of overall fitness adaptations. However, within team sports, such as football, can be complicated due to the various training goals, volume of training and practices required as well as an extended season of competition ‚Äì with reference to additional progressive competition matches (Gamble, 2006). This showing that periodization models can be difficult to implement in team sports due to its ever-changing nature, relating to why there are limited studies regarding the implementation of periodization in team sports.  Tactical periodization  For many years, football training and its planning has been (and still is) characterised by fragmented thinking of which has perhaps been attributed to the success of such an approach in individual sports. The emphasis of planning and improvement was mainly in regards to the physical attributes of strength, speed and endurance.Carvalhal, C. (2014). ‚ÄòSoccer: Developing A Know-how‚Äô, Prime Books Furtheremore, whether it be the undulating model, the reverse linear model or the traditional periodization framework, one of the underpinning assumptions is that it would be best to segregate the programme into distinct training blocks in a sequential hierarchy i.e. a training block to build endurance before speed and strength before power. This is claimed to be based on the ‚Äòscience of periodization‚Äô. However, Kiely,Kiely, J. (2010). ‚ÄòPeriodization, planning, prediction: And why the future ain‚Äôt what it used to be!‚Äô, UKA, 1-14. argues that the proof on which this is all based on is flawed because the studies used to build this proof have only ‚Äòcompared training interventions with no training variation to those with degrees of variation‚Äô but did not offer any insight ‚Äòinto how that variation is best scheduled and organised‚Äô (Kiely, 2010, p. 4). So although it is commonly agreed that training variation is an important design feature which needs to be integrated into the training plan, there is ‚Äòlittle or no supporting evidence‚Äô which proves that the segregation of the program into distinct training blocks or that there should be sequential hierarchy of how this should be done is in fact advantageous. Many authors such as Garganta, Maia, & Marque,Garganta, J., Maia, J. & Marques, A. (1996). ‚ÄòAcerca da investiga√ß√£o dos factores de rendimento em futebol‚Äô, Revista paulista de educa√ß√£o f√≠sica, S√£o Paulo, 10, (2), 146-158. Oliveira,Oliveira, G.J.

(2014). ‚ÄòWhat is tactical periodization?‚Äô Bennion Kearny Limited. have argued in regards to the indivisibility of the 4 components which make up a football performance...technical, tactical, physical and mental. This complexity makes football a multidimensional phenomenon which cannot be simply reduced to the sum of its parts. Is defending more important than attacking or vice versa? This question cannot be answered as football needs to be understood as a whole. As highlighted by Tamarit,Tamarit, X. (2014). ‚ÄòWhat is tactical periodization?‚Äô Bennion Kearny Limited. football is a tactical game where players are constantly required to make decisions in response to specific situations. So football needs to be viewed as a tactical game which encompasses with it the physical, technical and mental aspects required for positive performances. This is the foundation upon which Victor Frade developed a training methodology known as tactical periodisation which emphasises the development of the tactical dimension. Therefore, any physical, technical or mental development must always have a tactical intention. In other words, although the ability to run for 90 minutes may seem vital to play the game, knowing when, where and how to run is much more important.

In 1995, Jezersko became part of Preddvor and became an independent municipality in 1998. Originally located in the historic region of Carinthia, it became part of the Upper Carniola Statistical Region in 2005. The seat of the municipality is the town of Zgornje Jezersko. Jezersko is located in the remote Kokra Valley in the Kamnik‚ÄìSavinja Alps, south of the Seeberg Saddle mountain pass and the border with the Austrian state of Carinthia. History The name of the area derives from a glacial lake near the settlement of Zgornje Jezersko that started to disappear after an earthquake in 1348. However, it was still described by Johann Weikhard von Valvasor in 1689 as a large lake. It gave the area its German name Seeland (literally \\"lake land\\", first recorded as Seelant in 1496), and its Slovene equivalent , which came into use at the end of the 19th century. A document from 1391 mentions the church of \\"St. Oswald by the Lake\\" (Sv. O≈æbolt pri Jezeru). The remote village was part of the Duchy of Carinthia until 1919, administratively linked to Eisenkappel in the north; however, the residents did not consider themselves \\"true\\" Carinthians. It was therefore the only settlement already ceded by the Carinthian Landtag assembly to the newly established State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs, before it was officially adjudicated together with the Me≈æa Valley and Dravograd to the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes by the 1919 Treaty of Saint-Germain. Settlements In addition to the municipal seat of Zgornje Jezersko, the municipality also includes the settlement of Spodnje Jezersko. Economy=Agriculture The main activities that locals engage in are tourism, cattle breeding, and forestry. Cattle breeding is extensive in Jezersko, both by private farms and larger corporations. Jezersko is also the place of the origin of the breed of sheep known as the Jezersko‚ÄìSolƒçava sheep. A sheep festival called the Sheep Dance () is held annually in mid-August. Tourism Jezersko has a long tourist tradition. There is a 3-star hotel in JezerskoHotel Planika Jezersko as well as private accommodation in self- catering units at vacation farms.Makek vacation farm site The location of the village offers exceptional views of the surrounding mountains, and it is a starting point for mountain hiking routes to Grintovec, Mount Koƒçna, and Big Peak (). The Kranj Lodge at Ledine () and the Czech Lodge at Spodnje Ravni () mountain huts are well known to mountain hikers.

His best-known works include Before the Mayflower (1962) and Forced into Glory (2000), a book about U.S. President Abraham Lincoln. Born and raised in Mississippi, Bennett graduated from Morehouse College. Thereafter, he served in the Korean War and began a career in journalism at the Atlanta Daily World before being hired away by Johnson Publishing Company to work for JET magazine. Later, Bennett was the long-time executive editor of Ebony magazine, and was associated with the publication for more than 50 years. Bennett also served as a visiting professor of history at Northwestern University. Biography=Early life and education Bennett was born in Clarksdale, Mississippi, on October 17, 1928, the son of Lerone Bennett Sr. and Alma Reed. When he was young, his family moved to Jackson, Mississippi, the capital. His father worked as a chauffeur and his mother a maid but they divorced when he was a child. At twelve he began writing for The Mississippi Enterprise, a Jackson, Mississippi, black owned paper. He recalled once getting in trouble for being distracted from an errand when he happened upon a newspaper to read. He attended segregated schools as a child under the state system, and graduated from Lanier High School. Bennett attended Morehouse College in Atlanta, Georgia, where he was classmates with Martin Luther King Jr. Graduating in 1949, Bennett recalled that this time was integral to his intellectual development. He also joined the Kappa Alpha Psi fraternity. Career Bennett served as a soldier during the Korean War, he also pursued graduate studies. He became a journalist for the Atlanta Daily World from 1949 until 1953. He also served as city editor for JET magazine from 1952 to 1953.\\"Lerone Bennett Jr. A Classical Author\\" , African-American Registry. The magazine was established in 1945 by John H. Johnson, who first founded its parent magazine, Ebony, that year. In 1953, Bennett became associate editor of Ebony magazine and then executive editor from 1958. The magazine served as his base for the publication of series of articles on African-American history. Some were collected and published as books. He wrote a 1954 article \\"Thomas Jefferson's Negro Grandchildren\\",Lerone Bennett, \\"Thomas Jefferson's Negro Grandchildren,\\" EBONY, Vol. X (November 1954), pp. 78‚Äì80. about the 20th-century lives of individuals claiming descent from Jefferson and his slave Sally Hemings. It brought black oral history into the public world of journalism and published histories. This relationship was long denied by Jefferson's daughter and two of her children, and main line historians relied on their account. But new works published in the 1970s and 1990s challenged that position. Since a 1998 DNA study demonstrated a match between an Eston Hemings descendant and the Jefferson male line, the historic consensus has shifted (including the position of the Thomas Jefferson Foundation at Monticello) to acknowledging that Jefferson likely had a 38-year relationship with Hemings and was the father of all her six children of record, four of whom survived to adulthood.\\"Conclusions\\", Report of the Research Committee on Thomas Jefferson and Sally Hemings, Monticello, January 2000, accessed March 9, 2011. Quote: The DNA study, combined with multiple strands of currently available documentary and statistical evidence, indicates a high probability that Thomas Jefferson fathered Eston Hemings, and that he most likely was the father of all six of Sally Hemings's children appearing in Jefferson's records. Those children are Harriet, who died in infancy; Beverly; an unnamed daughter who died in infancy; Harriet; Madison; and Eston.\\" In addition Bennett wrote several books, including numerous histories of the African-American experience. These include his first work, Before the Mayflower: A History of Black America, 1619‚Äì1962 (1962), which discusses the contributions of African Americans in the United States from its earliest years. Bennet served as visiting professor of history at Northwestern University.

Vienna: C. Kr. Dvorna in Dr≈æavna Tiskarna, p. 54.) is the largest town and the seat of the Municipality of Naklo in Slovenia. In addition to the main settlement, formerly known as Veliko NakloRadmannsdorf (map, 1:75,000). 1907. Vienna: K.u.k. Milit√§rgeographisches Institut. (), it includes the hamlets of Malo Naklo (), Pivka (), and Podreber. Name Naklo was first mentioned in written sources in 1241 as Nacel (and as Nakel in 1252, Nachil in 1317, Nakal in 1320, Nackel in 1323, and Nakel in 1328). The name Naklo appears elsewhere in Slovenia and in other Slavic countries‚Äîfor example, Nak≈Ço (Poland) and N√°klo (Czech Republic). The name is derived from *nak—älo, a fused form that has lost inflection from the prepositional phrase *na k—älƒõ 'on a (sandy) spit in a river', thus referring to the location of the settlement.Snoj, Marko. 2009. Etimolo≈°ki slovar slovenskih zemljepisnih imen. Ljubljana: Modrijan and Zalo≈æba ZRC, pp. 279‚Äì280. The town was known as Naklas in German in the past. History Naklo was plundered by Ottoman forces in 1475. In June 1809 the town was plundered by French troops. Banditry was a long-term problem in the area, and local bandits took shelter in the nearby Udin Woods (). Naklo had one of the first running water systems installed in Slovenia, in the 18th century, due to the efforts of Jurij Voglar (1651‚Äì1717), who willed his property in order to achieve this goal. During the Second World War, German forces surrounded Naklo with a network of bunkers and wire barriers, and they established a headquarters for an SS regiment in the town. Church The local church is dedicated to Saint Peter. It is a Baroque structure and was renovated after a fire in 1843. The altar painting is by Leopold Layer (1752‚Äì1828), and the Stations of the Cross were painted by Janez Wolf (1825‚Äì1884).

The list includes 79 structures and historic districts that are significant for their architectural, historical, or industrial/economic importance. History Iron County, originally part of Marquette County, was first surveyed in 1851. At that time, the area was populated almost exclusively by Native Americans from the Menominee and Ojibwe tribes. Although the original 1851 survey of the county noted the presence of iron ore, European settlers began arriving in numbers in 1875, prospecting for iron ore. In 1880, two important ore strikes were made: the first was by John Armstrong, who opened the Crystal Falls Mine along the Paint River, and the second was by Donald C. MacKinnon, who opened the Iron River (or Riverton) Mine along the Iron River. These two mines were the foundation of the two main population centers of the county, and the success of the mines brought more prospectors to the area, with 70 mines eventually producing ore in the county. Logging also began in the county in 1875, and lumber mills were soon another important contributor the area's economy. Railroads, particularly the Chicago and Northwestern Railroad, extended lines into the county to service the expanding mines. Lines to both Iron River and Crystal Falls were completed in 1882, and both settlements expanded rapidly. Separate townships for Iron River and Crystal Falls, still under the auspices of Marquette County, were created in 1882. However, there was much local sentiment for establishing a new county for the area, and in 1885 Iron County was split from Marquette County. At the time of Iron County's creation, Iron River, then the only incorporated village in the county, was designated the county seat. However, a bitter dispute over the location of county buildings immediately erupted between the geographically disparate east side, centered on Crystal Falls, and the west side, centered on Iron River. The dispute lasted until 1889, when a county- wide general election designated Crystal Falls as the county seat. By 1890, there were nearly 4500 people living in Iron County, supported primarily by the mining and timber industries. However, the Panic of 1893 caused a depression in iron prices that lead to the closing of nearly all iron mines in the county and a severe curtailing of lumbering activities. County residents turned to agriculture to support themselves. The economy of the area rebounded around the turn of the century as major mining companies, such as the M. A. Hanna Company and Pickands, Mather and Company bought up smaller mines in the area. Logging of hardwoods began in the county around the same time, and a long period of sustained growth stretched until the Great Depression. The population of the county crew substantially during this time, reaching 20,805 in 1930. A great many of the newcomers were immigrants from Ireland, Italy, Poland, Scandinavia, Scotland, and Wales. New villages were platted, primarily to house mine workers, including Alpha, Mineral Hills, Caspian, and Gaastra. Iron River, Crystal Falls, and Stambaugh were all expanded. To serve the new residents, an electric street car line was installed in 1906, and a number of public schools were built. The Great Depression ended Iron County's economic boom. Iron mining in the county was completely halted, and lumbering was substantially reduced, leaving thousands of workers unemployed. Several federal government projects were funded in the county, including the Cooks Run Trout Feeding Station (built in 1933-34), the Pentoga Park Office and Bathhouse (built in 1936), and various Civilian Conservation Corps projects crafted by workers at Camp Gibbs (built in 1934). The mining industry was temporarily revived by World War II, but mining declined steadily in the postwar years, with few mines lasting into the 1960s and the last iron mine in the county closing in 1979. Lumber, however, has remained a substantial economic enterprise in the area, employing thousands of people until the present day. Historic places There are 80 listings on the National Register of Historic Places in Iron County, Michigan. These structures date primarily from Iron County's economic boom during the first two decades of the 20th century, although some structures date from the initial influx of residents soon after the 1880 start of intensive iron mining. The first structure listed, in 1975, was the Iron County Courthouse, which is probably the most architecturally significant structure in the county. Nearly all the subsequent listings were submitted as part of the Iron County MRA, a 1983 Multiple Property Submission that attempted to collect the most historically and architecturally significant structures in the county. Seventy-two of the Iron County listings are part of this MRA, and one more property, Central School, was initially nominated as part of the MRA but actually listed separately, in 2008. Four more structures, all highway bridges, were listed as part of the Highway Bridges of Michigan Multiple Property Submission. Other than the Courthouse, only one structure on this list, the Chicago, Milwaukee and Saint Paul Railway Iron River Depot, was not associated with either of the Multiple Property Submissions. } Former listings } See also *List of Michigan State Historic Sites in Iron County, Michigan References Iron County Category:Iron County, Michigan Category:Buildings and structures in Iron County, Michigan * ","title":"National Register of Historic Places listings in Iron County, Michigan"},{"id":"4161432","text":"The following is a list of Registered Historic Places in Ionia County, Michigan. } See also *List of Registered Historic Places in Michigan *List of Michigan State Historic Sites in Ionia County, Michigan References Ionia County Category:Ionia County, Michigan Category:Buildings and structures in Ionia County, Michigan * ","title":"National Register of Historic Places listings in Ionia County, Michigan"},{"id":"4161433","text":"The following is a list of Registered Historic Places in Huron County, Michigan.

Gale directed Richard Harrison in Intrusion Cambodia AKA Rescue Team (1981), also starring a cast of Silver Star workhorses such as Romano Kristoff, James Gaines, Mike Monty, Mike Cohen, and Ronnie Patterson. The assistant director of Intrusion Cambodia was Teddy Page, another prolific Silver Star director. Gale directed Kristoff and Monty again in Slash (1984), a film influenced by the Rambo series starring Sylvester Stallone, to the point of plagiarism. Slash also featured Nick Nicholson and Gwendolyn Hung. Another film of debatable note was Commando Invasion (1986), which featured Gordon Mitchell, Ken Watanabe (not to be confused with the more famous Ken Watanabe) and former model Tetchie Agbayani (as Carol Roberts, also in Intrusion Cambodia). Gale also directed Christopher Mitchum thrice, in Master Samurai (1974), Commander Firefox (1983) and SFX Retaliator (1987). He seems to be now retired from film.

This is intended to be a complete list of the properties and districts on the National Register of Historic Places in Houghton County, Michigan, United States. The locations of National Register properties and districts for which the latitude and longitude coordinates are included below, may be seen in a map. There are 42 properties and districts listed on the National Register in the county, including 2 National Historic Landmarks. History=Early history Houghton County was created in 1845, and then encompassed the present-day Houghton County as well as Keweenaw County and Ontonagon County. Copper mining The history of Houghton County in inextricably linked with copper mining, and, indeed, nearly all of the NRHP-listed properties in the county are directly or indirectly linked to the mines. The two most successful copper mines in the county were the Calumet and Hecla Mining Company and the Quincy Mine, both of which are now National Historic Landmarks. =Calumet and Hecla= The NHL Calumet Historic District includes a substantial proportion of the town of Calumet, Michigan, and the separately listed Calumet and Hecla Industrial District and Calumet Downtown Historic District. The former covers many of the industrial mining buildings of the Calumet and Hecla Mining Company, while the latter covers the commercial portion of Calumet‚Äîthe city was built substantially as a company town, and many of the buildings were constructed by, or with support from, Calumet and Hecla. This was true also of the Calumet Fire Station and the Calumet Theatre. The Keweenaw National Historical Park is also located primarily in Calumet. In addition, the nearby town of Laurium, now a historic district, was populated substantially by executives and white-collar workers from the Calumet and Hecla. Of particular note is the Thomas H. Hoatson House, built by mining executive Thomas H. Hoatson. =Quincy Mine= The other substantial mine in Houghton County was the Quincy Mine. This NHL covers the mining property and nearby homes, as well as the significant Quincy Mine No. 2 Shaft Hoist House. Another Quincy property, the Quincy Mining Company Stamp Mills, is also on the NRHP. Like Calumet, the town of Hancock was also substantially a company town, this time of the Quincy Mine. The affluent East Hancock was populated by mine employees and managers. =Other mines= Other properties on the register were associated with the copper mining industry in Houghton County. These include the Smith-Dengler House, built by the Wolverine Copper Mining Company; the Redridge Steel and Log Dams, built as a joint project by the Atlantic Mining Company and the Baltic Mining Company; and the community of Painesdale, Michigan, built by the Champion Mining Company. Commercial Houghton County Many of the communities in Houghton County were mining towns, but these communities too required commercial and social structures. The primarily commercial downtown districts of four Houghton County Communities are on the register: the Calumet Downtown Historic District mentioned above, the Lake Linden Historic District in Lake Linden, the Shelden Avenue Historic District in Houghton, and the Quincy Street Historic District in Hancock. In addition to the districts, individual commercial buildings have been recognized for their historic importance: the Joseph Bosch Building in Lake Linden, the J. Vivian, Jr. and Company Building in Laurium, and the Douglass House and Shelden-Dee Block (and the Ransom B. Shelden House) in Houghton. Civic and government buildings Another important subset of structures in Houghton County are public buildings. These buildings were often built with the help of, the mining companies that ran the towns; such was the case with the Calumet Fire Station and the Hancock Town Hall and Fire Hall, both substantial red sandstone structures. Other government buildings include the South Range Community Building, the Lake Linden Village Hall and Fire Station and of course the Houghton County Courthouse.

The devotees refer to their saints as lovers of God, the beloved. Urs rituals are generally performed by the custodians of the shrine or the existing Shaikh of the silsila.

Early history Copper was discovered in the Keweenaw in the 1830s; soon after, the US government built Fort Wilkins near Copper Harbor to maintain order in the area. Keweenaw County was split off from Houghton County in 1861, with the county seat in Eagle River. The early government and commercial buildings in Eagle River are now a Historic District. Isle Royale, although split off into its own county in 1875, was reunited with Keweenaw County ten years later, and remains part of the county. Mining Like Houghton County to the south, Keweenaw County's history includes much reference to copper mining. In particular, one of the earliest mines in the area, the prehistoric Minong Mine on Isle Royale, is listed as a historic district. In addition, the Central Mine and its Methodist Church are also listed on the historic register. Shipping and transportation However, with the greatest Great Lake, Lake Superior, surrounding the peninsula, and multiple natural harbors, Keweenaw County's history is much more entwined in shipping and transportation. Nineteen of the properties listed‚Äîover half‚Äîwere directly related to Great Lakes shipping. These include nine lighthouses in Lake Superior: Copper Harbor Light, Eagle Harbor Light, Gull Rock Light Station, Isle Royale Light, Manitou Island Light Station, Passage Island Light, Rock Harbor Light, Rock of Ages Light, and Sand Hills Light. In addition, the wrecks of ten ships around Isle Royale are on the Register: The SS Algoma, SS America, SS Chester A. Congdon, PS Cumberland, SS Emperor, George M. Cox, SS Glenlyon, SS Henry Chisholm, SS Kamloops, and the SS Monarch. In addition, the listings contain three road bridges built in the 1930s: the M-26‚ÄìCedar Creek Culvert, the M-26‚ÄìSilver River Culvert, and the US 41‚ÄìFanny Hooe Creek Bridge. Finally, the Houghton County Traction Company Ahmeek Streetcar Station, an interurban rail station, represents local transportation in the Keweenaw. Tourism As the mining industry in the Keweenaw ran down, tourism in the area increased. This was evidenced by the increase in passenger ships (notably the SS America, mentioned above) and the construction of tourist hotels and summer cottages such as the Johns Hotel, the first resort on Isle Royale, and the Keweenaw Mountain Lodge and Golf Course Complex, built in 1933‚Äì34. Also in the 1930s, the roads accessing the Keweenaw communities were improved, with the addition of bridges such as the US 41‚ÄìFanny Hooe Creek Bridge.

John J. Cavanaugh, C.S.C. (Jan. 23, 1899 ‚Äì Dec. 28, 1979), a priest of the Congregation of Holy Cross, served from 1946 to 1952 as the 14th president of the University of Notre Dame, having previously served as its vice president since 1941. Life before ordination Cavanaugh's family emigrated from the tri-County region of southwest County Wicklow, on the Cos. Carlow and Wexford border. They settled originally in Erinsville, Ontario and later trekked to the upper Middle West, settling in Owosso, MI. Cavanaugh was a first cousin to the Honorable John Franklin Kinney of Rochester, New York. The Kenney, Cavanaugh, and Keegan families are all native to the region around Coolkenno. As a child, John Cavanaugh served in the choir at Saint Paul's Church in Owosso, Michigan. He assisted his father in the family's grocery store, as well. He retained a lifelong connect to the town, having been baptized, confirmed and celebrating his first mass at Saint Paul's. Entering Notre Dame in 1917, he earned his way through college working as a secretary for Presidents John W. Cavanaugh, C.S.C. (1905-1919) and James A. Burns, C.S.C. (1919-1922). Cavanaugh was an athlete, editor of the student-run The Observer, as well as student government president. In 1923, John Cavanaugh initially entered the automobile industry, working in the advertising department at Studebaker Corporation. He later served as private secretary to Henry Ford. In 1926, he left private industry to undertake religious discernment. Ministry at Notre Dame John Cavanaugh then took his master's at Notre Dame in 1927, and a degree from the Gregorian University at Rome, Italy. Ordained in 1931, he was employed by his alma mater, University of Notre Dame. Cavanaugh was then assigned as prefect of religion from 1933 to 1938. Then he served as assistant provincial for the Congregation of the Holy Cross until 1940. In 1940, he was elevated to vice president of the university and in 1941 he was made Notre Dame's president. According to the New York Times, Cavanaugh's legacy at Notre Dame in the post-war years was \\"devoted to raising academic standards and reshaping the university administration to suit it to an enlarged educational mission and an expanded student body\\" and stressing \\"advanced studies and research\\" at a time when Notre Dame quadrupled in student census, undergraduate enrollment increased by more than half, and graduate student enrollment grew fivefold. Cavanaugh also established the Lobund Institute for Animal Studies and Notre Dame's Medieval Institute.Wolfgang Saxon, Rev. John Cavanaugh, 80, Former President of Notre Dame (Dec. 30, 1979). Cavanaugh also presided over the construction of the Nieuwland Science Hall, Fisher Hall, and the Morris Inn, as well as the Hall of Liberal Arts (now O'Shaughnessy Hall), made possible by a donation from I.A. O'Shaughnessy, at the time the largest ever made to an American Catholic university. Cavanaugh reorganized the administration in order to free himself to pursue fundraising activities and to act as a salesman for the University. Cavanaugh's reorganization created five vice presidents, who focused their attention on the various aspects of the rapidly growing University. Father Theodore Hesburgh, at age 32, was appointed executive vice president - the one vice president to whom all the others reported. Cavanaugh also established a system of advisory councils at the University, which continue today and are vital to the University's governance and development. In 1952, President Cavanaugh was required to resign as president in order to retain his position as a superior in the Holy Cross community. But he continued to serve the university as the Director of the Notre Dame Foundation. His successor was Rev. Theodore M. Hesburgh. Informal Chaplain to the Joseph P. Kennedy Family During his many years of association with Joseph P. Kennedy, Father John was called on for advice and assistance in times of difficulty. He officiated many of the Kennedy family weddings, said a special Mass in the East Room of the White House prior to John Fitzgerald Kennedy's funeral at St. Matthew's Cathedral, and was one of the three priests serving at the funeral itself. As spiritual and secular advisor to the Kennedys, Father Cavanaugh also performed other rites for the family. On April 24, 1954, for instance, Cavanaugh performed the marriage of Peter Lawford and Patricia Kennedy at The Church of Saint Thomas More in New York, New York. Some of the 250 guests at the wedding reception at the Plaza Hotel included Greer Garson, Marion Davies, Bernard Baruch, Supreme Court Justice William O. Douglas, Mr. and Mrs. Igor Cassini, and Mr. and Mrs. Morton Downey Sr.Patricia Kennedy Lawford (Dec. 25, 2011). He was the personal priest of the Kennedy family and a good friend of John F. Kennedy's father, Joseph Kennedy. John Cavanaugh was Virginia Joan Bennett's preferred celebrant for her wedding to Edward Moore Kennedy in 1958, but Rose and Joseph Kennedy chose Cardinal Francis Spellman instead.J. Randy Taraborrelli, Jackie, Ethel, Joan (2000) at 89. Joseph P. Kennedy sparked up a friendship with Father Cavanaugh when he became a member of University of Notre Dame's Board of Trustees. Beginning in 1958, Father Cavanaugh advised Joseph P. Kennedy on a strategy for addressing American Protestant concerns about the potential election of a Roman Catholic president.Thomas Maier, The Kennedys: America's Emerald Kings (2003) at 324. In 1959, Father Cavanaugh also advised Joseph P. Kennedy on the hiring of Harris Wofford for the 1960 Presidential Campaign.David Pietrusza, 1960 LBJ v. JFK v. Nixon (Dec. 25, 2011). The future Senator from the State of Pennsylvania was a civil rights attorney then teaching at Notre Dame Law School. Father Cavanaugh, as former president of the University, approached Father Theodore Hesburgh to arrange a leave of absence. Cavanaugh was present with the Kennedy family at Hyannisport in 1960, as they anxiously awaited returns from the swing states of Michigan, Illinois, Minnesota and California in the unexpectedly close Presidential election.Doug Wead, The Raising of a President (2005) at 245. Father John's advice to the Kennedy family included thoughts on the handling of materials censored by the Vatican, as when Rose Kennedy asked for judgments on Victor Hugo's Les Miserables, all of √âmile Zola's works, and some tomes by Jean Jacques Rousseau.Doris Kearns Goodwin, The Fitzgeralds and the Kennedys: An American Saga (1987) at 796. But the relationship was reciprocated. When the United States Military Academy uncovered excessive cheating on its Varsity Football team, Father Cavanaugh obtained a special gift from Joseph P. Kennedy to provide Notre Dame scholarships for all the former cadets, under the condition that they play no varsity sports.Associated Press, Anonymous Donor Offers Cadets Fulls Scholarships at Notre Dame, N.Y. Times (Aug. 22, 1951). Trivia * After the assassination of John F. Kennedy, Cavanaugh stayed with Mr. & Mrs. Joseph Kennedy at their Hyannisport, MA estate and then traveled to Washington D.C. for the funeral.http://www.shiawasseehistory.com/cavanaugh.html *Cavanaugh was portrayed by Robert Prosky in the 1993 film Rudy.

Born and educated in Wakefield, Yorkshire he then took an M.A. at University College, Oxford. After two years teaching history he joined the BBC, in Birmingham, working first in radio (it is thought that he was the director of the episode of The Archers which featured the death of Grace Archer in a fire, a spoiler for the opening of independent television) and then television, as a director. He won the BAFTA 'Best Director' Award in 1960 for An Age of Kings, a television adaptation of Shakespeare's history plays. He subsequently directed Shakespeare's Roman plays in the series The Spread of the Eagle. After a period of freelance theatre work he joined the Birmingham Repertory Theatre as Artistic Director in the autumn of 1965, in its original building - the first purpose built repertory theatre in the UK - and remained in that post until the company moved to the new venue in 1971, leaving in 1972, his last production there being the double-bill of Sophocles Oedipus the King and Sheridan's The Critic with Derek Jacobi in both plays' leading roles. Previously his productions of Shakespeare's As You Like It and Peter Luke's Hadrian VII had transferred from the old Birmingham Rep to London's West End, the latter going on to New York gaining Dews a Tony Award for its direction. Other notable productions at the Rep included Hamlet, with Richard Chamberlain in 1969, Quick, Quick Slow (1969) a musical by Monty Norman and Julian More, based on a play by David Turner, who also scripted the musical, and The Sorrows of Frederick, an epic play about Frederick the Great by Romulus Linney, in 1970. At the Chichester Festival Theatre he guest-directed, amongst other productions, Antony and Cleopatra with Sir John Clements and Margaret Leighton, and the original production of Robert Bolt's Vivat! Vivat Regina! which transferred to London's West End and Broadway. Dews succeeded Keith Michell as the fourth artistic director of the Chichester Festival Theatre in 1978 and directed three Festival seasons. One notable production during this period was Julius Caesar in Puritan costume suggesting the plotting of the Gunpowder Plot. He also directed he original production of Royce Ryton's Crown Matrimonial, about the 1936 Abdication crisis, in the West End, with Wendy Hiller as Queen Mary. He also directed productions in the USA, Canada, South Africa, Israel, Malta, √âire and Hong Kong, in the UK he also directed at Nottingham Playhouse (A Midsummer Night's Dream), Edinburgh Lyceum Theatre (Bertolt Brecht's Galileo, which he directed again at Birmingham) and Greenwich Theatre (Inferno by Ian Curteis).

It criticizes United States President Abraham Lincoln and claims that his reputation as the \\"Great Emancipator\\" during the American Civil War is undeserved. In his introduction, Bennett wrote: The book is dedicated to those individuals whom Bennett calls \\"the real abolitionists\\", including Frederick Douglass, Thaddeus Stevens, and Wendell Phillips. In the dedication, he praises them for forcing Lincoln \\"into glory\\". Bennett's critics, including historians James M. McPherson, Eric Foner, and Lucas E. Morel, believe that he ignores Lincoln's political and moral growth during the course of the Civil War. In addition, they surmise that Bennett oversimplifies the complexities of the period on issues of race when criticizing Lincoln. Unlike Bennett, they conclude that Lincoln was instrumental in creating the framework that emancipated the slaves in the United States. In a 2009 review of three newly published books on Lincoln, historian Brian Dirck referred to Bennett's 2000 work and linked him with Thomas DiLorenzo, another critic of Lincoln.

He is now considered one of the most successful fashion photographers in the industry, shooting regularly for both US and Italian Vogue, and lately W (also published by Cond√© Nast) and British Vogue. Early life Meisel studied at the High School of Art and Design and Parsons The New School for Design where he attended different courses but, as affirmed in an interview with Ingrid Sischy for Vogue France, he finally majored in fashion illustration. Career One of Meisel's first jobs was to work for fashion designer Halston as an illustrator. He also taught illustration part-time at Parsons. Meisel never thought he could become a photographer. He admired photographers like Jerry Schatzberg, Irving Penn, Richard Avedon and Bert Stern. He felt that illustration was a thing of the past and found photography as a lasting medium. Later on, while working at Women's Wear Daily as an illustrator, he went to Elite Model Management where Oscar Reyes, a booker who liked his illustrations, allowed him take pictures of some of their models. He would photograph them in his apartment in Gramercy Park or on the street: on weekdays he would work at Women's Wear Daily and on weekends with the models. One of them was Phoebe Cates. Some of these models went to castings for Seventeen magazine to show their portfolios which held some of his photography and the people at Seventeen subsequently called Meisel and asked if he wanted to work with them. Meisel currently works for many different fashion magazines, most notably Interview and US and Italian Vogue. Meisel has contributed photos for the covers of several popular albums and singles, including two RIAA Diamond-certified albums, Madonna's 1984 album \\"Like a Virgin\\" and Mariah Carey's 1995 album Daydream. His work also can be seen on the cover of Madonna's single \\"Bad Girl\\" (a nude), the limited picture disc for Madonna's UK single release of \\"Fever\\" (a partial nude), and Mariah Carey's single \\"Fantasy\\" (simply a different crop of the photo on the cover of the Daydream album). Fashion campaigns Amongst others, Meisel has shot campaigns for Versace, Valentino, Dolce & Gabbana, Louis Vuitton, Balenciaga and Calvin Klein (his campaigns for whom were very controversial). Meisel also shoots Prada campaigns each season ‚Äî having done so since 2004. In April 2008 he shot friend Madonna for Vanity Fair, and later in the year he shot her for the 2009 spring campaign by Louis Vuitton. He is a close friend of designer Anna Sui for whom he also shot several campaigns, even though Sui rarely uses advertising to promote her clothing. Influence As one of the most powerful photographers in the fashion industry, Meisel is credited with \\"discovering\\" or promoting the careers of many successful models, including Linda Evangelista, Guinevere Van Seenus, Karen Elson, Meghan Collison, Amber Valletta, Kristen McMenamy, Stella Tennant, Raquel Zimmerman, Sasha Pivovarova, Naomi Campbell, Christy Turlington, Gisele B√ºndchen, Caroline Trentini, Karlie Kloss, Jourdan Dunn, Joan Smalls, Iris Strubegger, Lindsey Wixson, Lara Stone, Coco Rocha, Natalia Vodianova, Vanessa Axente, and Elise Crombez, propelling them to fame by regularly featuring them in Vogue and various campaigns. Meisel's influence and training seems to also extend past models. He used his influence among the fashion elite to create an issue of Vogue that would show only black models. He also launched the career of Ross Van Der Heide, a young fashion designer, by showing Ross's artwork to Anna Sui. Meisel has been the force behind the careers of people he regularly used on his Vogue shoots; hairstylists Jimmy Paul, Oribe Canales, Garren, Orlando Pita and Guido Palau, and make-up artists Fran√ßois Nars, Laura Mercier, Pat McGrath and the late Kevyn Aucoin owe some of their success to the photographer. Anna and Franca Meisel has been a prot√©g√© of both Franca Sozzani and Anna Wintour, editors-in-chief of Italian and American Vogue, respectively. For the former, he used to photograph the cover of every issue (until her death in December 2016), something generally unheard of in the ever-changing fashion industry. Meisel often creates layouts which are controversial, by juxtaposing fashion and politics and/or social standards. For example, in the September 2006 issue of Vogue Italia', Meisel played with the concept of restricted liberties post-September 11 America, with the models portraying terrorists and highly trained policemen. It caused a stir in the press, as the models were presented in violent compositions where they could be seen as being victimized. It also elicited a negative response from feminists which saw the role of the women as being undermined by their male counterparts. The July 2008 issue of Vogue Italia featured only black models, and was entirely photographed by Meisel. It was a response to increasing criticism of racism in the fashion industry and became the best-selling issue in the magazine's history. When asked about the issue, Meisel said, \\"Obviously I feel that fashion is totally racist. The one thing that taking pictures allows you to do is occasionally make a larger statement. After seeing all the shows though I feel it was totally ineffective. I was curious‚Äîbecause it received a lot of publicity‚Äîwhether it would have any effect on New York, London, Paris, or Milan, and I found that it did not. They still only had one token black girl, maybe two. It‚Äôs the same as it always was and that‚Äôs the sad thing for me.\\" Artist Rep agency Art + Commerce represents Steven Meisel for image licensing and advertising.http://www.artandcommerce.com/aac/C.aspx?VP=Mod_StaticPage.StaticPage_VPage&SP;=home&HN;=T Private life Meisel is notorious for rarely giving interviews or being photographed. However, in one of few cases, he was interviewed by Ingrid Sischy for Vogue Paris. The following year, Meisel agreed to be interviewed for 032c magazine by Pierre-Alexandre de Looz. De Looz' piece, \\"Who Is Steven Meisel?\\", was accompanied by a 14-page fold-out retrospective of Meisel's twenty years of covers for Vogue Italia. Album Meisel is also one of very few famous photographers who does not have a book solely dedicated to his work. A book collecting some of his photographs called Steven MeiselMeisel, S. Steven Meisel (Broschiert) (German website), Teneues Buchverlag, 2003, was published by German teNeues Buchverlag in 2003 and sold out.

These properties represent over a century's worth of the city's growth, from the Charles Trowbridge House (built in 1826, and the oldest known structure in the city) to structures in the Detroit Financial District built in the late 1950s and early 1960s. However, due to the growth of Detroit and successive waves of redevelopment, there are few structures in the city dating from before the Civil War. Some of these structures, including the Trowbridge House, are private homes built along East Jefferson: the Sibley House (1848), the Beaubien House (1851), and the Moross House (1855). Other extant pre-1860 structures include Fort Wayne (1849); Saints Peter and Paul Church (1848) and Mariner's Church (1849); and scattered commercial buildings (one in Randolph Street Commercial Buildings Historic District, for example). Most of the listed structure in Detroit are associated with the changes wrought by the establishment of substantial industry in the city (in the late 19th century) and the subsequent rise of the automobile industry to a dominant position (in the early 20th century). The historically significant structures include not only manufacturing facilities, but associated office buildings, and the commercial and residential properties built to serve the influx of people into Detroit. In the latter half of the 19th century, multiple manufacturing firms were established near Jefferson to take advantage of the transportation resources afforded by the river and a parallel rail line. These included the shipyard that eventually became the Dry Dock Engine Works-Detroit Dry Dock Company Complex, Parke-Davis, the Frederick Stearns Company, and Globe Tobacco. The rise of manufacturing led to a new class of wealthy industrialists, entrepreneurs, and professionals who built houses along Jefferson and Woodward Avenue, including the Croul-Palms House (1881), the William H. Wells House (1889), the John N. Bagley House (1889), the Col. Frank J. Hecker House (1888) and the Charles Lang Freer House (1887). Along with these private homes, upscale apartments, such as the Coronado Apartments (1894), the Verona Apartments (1894) and a spate of churches, such as the Cass Avenue Methodist Episcopal Church (1883), the First Presbyterian Church (1889), were constructed in the city. At the turn of the 20th century, entrepreneurs in the Detroit area‚Äînotably Henry Ford‚Äîforged into production of the automobile, capitalizing on the already-existing machine tool and coach- building industry in the city. Early automotive production is recognizable by structures such as the Ford Piquette Avenue Plant (1904) (a National Historic Landmark), and multiple structures in the surrounding Piquette Avenue Industrial Historic District (including the now-destroyed E-M-F/Studebaker Plant, 1906) and the New Amsterdam Historic District (including the original Cadillac factory, 1905. As the industry grew, newly minted automotive magnates built commercial and office buildings such as General Motors Building (1919) and the Fisher Building (1928), both National Historic Landmarks. The industry accelerated the growth of Detroit, and the population boom led to the construction of apartment buildings aimed at the middle-class auto worker, including the Somerset Apartments (1922), the Garden Court Apartments (1915), and the Manchester Apartments (1915). At the same time, new upscale neighborhoods farther from the center of the city sprang up, including Boston- Edison, Indian Village, and Palmer Woods. Automobile wealth led to a boom in downtown Detroit business, and the construction of a collection of early 20th century skyscrapers. The most notable of these is the Art Deco National Historic Landmark Guardian Building (1928), but numerous other significant office buildings such as the Vinton Building (1916), the Barlum Tower (1927), and the Lawyers Building (1922) were also constructed. The building boom was not confined to businesses. Shopping districts sprang up along Park Avenue, Broadway, and Woodward. Multiple hotels were constructed, including the Fort Shelby Hotel (1916), the Detroit-Leland Hotel (1927), the Royal Palm Hotel (1924), and many others. Extravagant movie theaters such as the Fox (1928) and the Palms (1925) were constructed. And public buildings, such as Orchestra Hall (1919), the Detroit Public Library (1921), and the Detroit Institute of Arts (1923). Other municipalities U.S. Census data map showing local municipal boundaries within Wayne County. Shaded areas represent incorporated cities. Rural Western Wayne County: Canton and Livonia In marked contrast to Detroit, urban and suburban development came late to the western part of Wayne County. Although suburbs are steadily encroaching into and through these areas, there are still pockets of rural land. The later development has protected some early structures, giving Canton in particular a more significant population of antebellum structures than even the older and larger Detroit. These include a string of Greek Revival structures: the Sheldon Inn (1825), Clyde House (1845), Kinyon House (1850), Bradford House (1860), and the Patterson House. Livonia also boasts Greenmead Farms, which is the original location of Joshua Simmons's 1841 Greek Revival farmhouse and 1829 barn; other structures have been moved to the site. Victorian-era houses have also recognized. These include the Truesdell House (1888), the Fischer Farmstead (1897), the Orson Everitt House (1899), and the Smith House (1904). In addition, the Wilson Barn in Livonia, instrumental in Ira Wilson's establishment of a million-dollar dairy, creamery, and trucking business, is recognized. However, not all historically significant structures have been protected from time and redevelopment. In particular, both the Boldman House (1835) and the Dingledey House (1881) have been demolished since their listing on the Register. Village Western Wayne County: Plymouth and Northville The villages of Northville and Plymouth boast historically significant houses representing a span of decades. The Northville Historic District contains numerous residential structures built between 1835 and the 1890s with most being early Gothic revival homes. Another significant property‚Äîthe Robert Yerkes House‚Äîis also in Northville, but across the county line in Oakland County. Plymouth contains two important Victorian-era homes‚Äîthe Italianate Henry W. Baker House (1875) and the Stick-Eastlake Charles G. Curtiss Sr. House (1890)-- as well as the Frank Lloyd Wright-designed Carlton D. Wall House (1941). Another historically important structure is farther east in Dearborn. The Commandant's Quarters was part of the Detroit Arsenal, built in 1833 in what was then the village of Dearbornville. Despite the growth of the surrounding city and the demolition or substantial alteration of the other Arsenal structures, the Commandant's Quarters has remained relatively intact. Henry Ford's Wayne County: Dearborn The automobile industry has had a profound effect on the development of Wayne County, and Ford Motor Corporation founderHenry Ford was one of the most influential pioneers. Ford put an indelible stamp on the history of Wayne County in general and Dearborn in particular, with not just one, but five National Historic Landmarks to his name. One of these Landmarks, the Ford Piquette Avenue Plant, is in Detroit; another (the Highland Park Ford Plant) is in Highland Park. The other three are in Dearborn. One of these Landmarks, the Ford River Rouge Complex, represents Henry Ford's industrial vision. Fair Lane was his personal estate. And Greenfield Village and Henry Ford Museum exemplified Ford's love of and passion for history. Ford also had other properties that found their way onto the National Register. The Dearborn Inn and Colonial Homes were built by Ford as an airport hotel, and the Ford Valve Plant in Northville was an experimental factory. Perhaps most significantly, the Henry Ford Square House was built by Henry Ford himself soon after his marriage to Clara Ford, and well before his ascent to being the richest man in the world. The Enclaves: Highland Park and Hamtramck Together, Highland Park and Hamtramck form an enclave within the city of Detroit. Both were established as independent municipalities when Detroit was much smaller than its current size, and remained so as the larger city grew to engulf them both. Both cities also owe much of their history and present character to the rise and eventual decline of the automobile industry. As noted, the most significant structure within Highland Park is the Highland Park Ford Plant (1910); likewise Hamtramck housed the huge Dodge Main plant (1914). Both plants attracted huge numbers of workers, swelling the populations of both cities. The influx of workers required housing. Two neighborhoods in Highland Park: Highland Heights- Stevens' Subdivision and Medbury's-Grove Lawn Subdivisions were significant because of their relatively middle-class residents who were able to build solid houses. The burgeoning population also required religious buildings. These included St. Florian (1928) in Hamtramck, serving the primarily Polish residents of the city, and the Highland Park Presbyterian Church (1910), First United Methodist Church (1916), Trinity United Methodist Church (1911), and the Grace Evangelical Lutheran Church (1929) in Highland Park. Northeast Wayne County: The Grosse Pointes The rise in industry and the automobile also affected the Grosse Pointes. This section of the county was a primarily agricultural district throughout much of the 19th century until Detroit's nouveau riche discovered the area and began building summer cottages there. As automobiles became more prevalent, and outlying suburbs more accessible, the Pointes quickly became a community of year-round upper-class residents. The historic structures within the cities reflect its transition to the home of wealthy Detroiters. These structures include early 20th-century houses in the Beverly Road Historic District and single-family homes such as the Carl E. and Alice Candler Schmidt House (1909) and the Russell A. Alger Jr. House (1910). The growing population at the turn of the 20th century also called for the construction of educational buildings such as Defer Elementary School (1924) Grosse Pointe South High School (1927), P√®re Gabriel Richard Elementary School (1929), and religious buildings such as Saint Paul Catholic Church (1895), Grosse Pointe Memorial Church (1923), and Christ Church Chapel (1930). Downriver: Lincoln Park, Wyandotte, and Grosse Ile Lincoln Park is a blue-collar downriver suburb. The two properties in the city, the Lincoln Park Post Office and Mellus Newspapers Building are both of relatively recent origin. In contrast, Wyandotte is an older city, and has seen its share of wealthy citizens. The Marx House, built by Warren Isham in 1862, housed a number of the city's most prominent citizens, and did the John and Emma Lacey Eberts House, built in 1872. Industrial giant Edward Ford was the son of glass pioneer John Baptiste Ford and the founder of the Michigan Alkalai Company in Wyandotte and the Ford Plate Glass Company in Toledo, Ohio (later the Libbey‚ÄìOwens‚ÄìFord Company). Ford built both the impressive Ford-Bacon House and the George P. MacNichol House across the street. Grosse Ile, near the southern tip of Wayne County, is a historically wealthy island community. Beginning in the middle of the 19th century, well-to-do businessmen from Detroit built summer homes on the island to escape the city. Some of the earliest mansions are included in the East River Road Historic District, and the nearby St. James Episcopal Church was built not long after the end of the Civil War. Wayne County bridges The Wayne County Road Commission was internationally renowned for its innovation. The historic bridges of Wayne County are scattered throughout the county, with two in the far western portion, one in Dearborn, three in Detroit, and the remainder close to the Detroit River south of the city. The western bridges‚Äîthe Waltz Road ‚Äì Huron River Bridge and the Lilley Road-Lower Rouge River Bridge‚Äîexemplify the population and traffic expansion in that portion of Wayne County during the early part of the century, and demonstrate the benefits of standardization in bridge construction adopted by the Road Commission. Likewise, the bridges along the river and on Grosse Ile show the variety of small bridges and culverts the Commission constructed. The Detroit bridges were a result of a grade separation carried on by the Commission to separate rail and automotive traffic, necessitated by the rise of the automobile. Another example of accommodating different modes of traffic is the bascule construction of the West Jefferson Avenue ‚Äì Rouge River Bridge. This was built to maintain shipping traffic in the river while allowing for automobile traffic along West Jefferson. The most recent of the historical bridges, the US 12 Bridges in Dearborn, represent the first crosstown expressway carrying automobile traffic through Detroit.

Its current chair, Barry Sheerman MP, was instrumental in moving an amendment to the 1981 Transport Act to ensure that seatbelt wearing became a requirement. More recently, it helped to ensure that powers to use evidential roadside breath testing equipment were made available to the police and that the police were given the power to seize uninsured vehicles through the Serious Organised Crime and Police Act 2005.  Membership  PACTS has an annual membership of over 150 organisations and individuals. To inform its work, it brings together expertise and knowledge from the public, private and professional sectors, comprising insurers, car manufacturers, police and emergency services, local authorities, research institutions and road user groups. It seeks to use this expertise to provide independent, research-based technical advice to Parliamentarians. Members also provide technical expertise through a structure of working parties. These look at road user behaviour, vehicle design, the road environment, aviation and rail safety. Chaired by independent and respected experts in the field, these enable PACTS to maintain its current knowledge and understanding of the issues facing transport safety.  Events  It organises the prestigious annual Westminster Lecture on Transport Safety to help disseminate key research and knowledge about transport safety. Those invited to give the lecture have included Professor Danny Dorling (Sheffield University), Professor Oliver Carsten (Leeds University Institute for Transport Studies), Dr Jillian Anable (Aberdeen University), Professor Fred Wegman (SWOV ‚Äì the Dutch road safety research institute) and Tony Bliss (Monash University Accident Research Centre). As part of its educational work, it also organises two conferences a year, usually held in October and March. These offer an opportunity for practitioners and researchers to debate key research findings and to evaluate examples of current practice in transport safety. Recent conferences have covered driving while impaired, vehicle design innovations and aiming for zero.  Europe  Recognising the importance of the European dimension in transport safety, PACTS was a co-founder of the European Transport Safety Council (ETSC) which is based in Brussels. This brings together representative organisations across the EU and occupies a similar position to PACTS in relation to the European Parliament and Commission.  Current work  In the summer of 2015 PACTS released its Road Safety Priorities 2015 (June 2015) setting out strategic initiatives which PACTS believes will aid in reducing death and injury on roads in the UK.http://www.pacts.org.uk/wp- content/uploads/sites/2/Manifesto-CORRECTED.pdf PACTS also publishes regular research reports, the most recent being Road Safety Since 2010 (September 2015), which assesses approaches to road safety since 2010 and contains recommendations to government and to transport providers to ensure that safety for all transport users is improved.http://www.pacts.org.uk/2015/09/road- safety-since-2010-a-report-with-the-rac-foundation References External links  * Official website Category:Road safety Transport Safety Category:Road safety in the United Kingdom ","title":"Parliamentary Advisory Council for Transport Safety"},{"id":"4161589","title":"Ted Burgin"},{"id":"4161614","text":"Farleigh may mean: Places= Australia  * Farleigh, Queensland, a town in the Mackay Region  England  * Farleigh, Somerset * Farleigh, Surrey * Farleigh Wallop, Hampshire * Farleigh School, Andover, Hampshire * Farleigh Hungerford, Somerset ** Farleigh House ** Farleigh Hungerford Castle * East Farleigh, Kent * Monkton Farleigh, Wiltshire * West Farleigh, Kent Other uses * Newbury Manor School, a special school formerly named Farleigh College Persons with the surname Farleigh * John Farleigh (1900-1965), English wood-engraver * Lynn Farleigh (born 1942), English actress * Richard Farleigh (born 1960), Australian private investor See also * Farley (disambiguation) ","title":"Farleigh"},{"id":"4161619","text":"Catling is an English surname that may also refer to a kitten, a juvenile cat.

It succeeded both The Masses (1912‚Äì1917) and The Liberator. New Masses was later merged into Masses & Mainstream (1948‚Äì1963). With the coming of the Great Depression in 1929 America became more receptive to ideas from the political Left and New Masses became highly influential in intellectual circles. The magazine has been called ‚Äúthe principal organ of the American cultural left from 1926 onwards.\\"Foley, Barbara. Radical Presentations: Politics and Form in U.S. Proletarian Fiction, 1929‚Äì1941. Durham, NC: Duke University Press, 1993; pg. 65. History= Early years  New Masses was launched in New York City in 1926 as part of the Workers (Communist) Party of America's publishing stable, produced by a communist leadership but making use of the work of an array of independent writers and artists.Paul Buhle, Marxism in the USA: From 1870 to the Present Day (London: Verson, 1987), p. 172. The magazine was established to fill a void caused by the gradual transition of The Workers Monthly (successor to The Liberator) into a more theoretically-oriented publication. The name of the new magazine was a tip of the hat to The Masses (1911‚Äì1917), forerunner of both publications. The editorial staff of New Masses included The Masses alumni Hugo Gellert, John F. Sloan, Max Eastman, Mike Gold, as well as Joseph Freeman, Granville Hicks (starting in 1934), Walt Carmon, and James Rorty. Many contributors are now considered distinguished, even canonical authors/writers, artists, and musical composers: William Carlos Williams, Theodore Dreiser, John Dos Passos, Upton Sinclair, Richard Wright, Ralph Ellison, Dorothy Parker, Dorothy Day, John Breecher, Langston Hughes, Eugene O'Neill, Rex Stout and Ernest Hemingway. More importantly, it also circulated works by avowedly leftist, even ‚Äúproletarian‚Äù (working-class) artists: Kenneth Fearing, H.H. Lewis, Jack Conroy, Grace Lumpkin, Jan Matulka, Ruth McKenney, Maxwell Bodenheim, Meridel LeSueur, Josephine Herbst, Jacob Burck, Tillie Olsen, Stanley Burnshaw, Louis Zukofsky, George Oppen, Crockett Johnson, Wanda G√°g, and Albert Halper, and Aaron Copland. The vast production of left-wing popular art of the 1930s and 1940s was an attempt to create a radical culture in conflict with mass culture. Infused with an oppositional mentality, this cultural front was a rich period in American history and is what Michael Denning calls a ‚ÄúSecond American Renaissance‚Äù because it permanently transformed American modernism and mass culture. One of the foremost periodicals of this renaissance was New Masses. The magazine adopted a loosely leftist position at its onset, and Frederick J. Hoffman describes ‚Äúamong the fifty-six writers and artists connected in some way with the early issues of the New Masses, [Joseph] Freeman reports, only two were members of the Communist Party, and less than a dozen were fellow travelers‚Äù.Hoffman, Frederick J., Charles Allen, and Carolyn F. Church. ‚ÄúPolitical Directions in the Literature of the Thirties.‚Äù The Little Magazine: a History and a Bibliography. Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 1946. 151. There was, however, eventual transformation: the editorial shift from a magazine of the radical left, with its numerous competing points of view, gave way to a bastion of Marxist conformity. When Gold and Freeman gained full control by 1928 the ‚ÄúStalinist/Trotskyist‚Äù division began in earnest. Gold‚Äôs January 1929 column ‚ÄúGo Left, Young Writers‚Äù began the ‚Äúproletarian literature‚Äù movement, one spurred by the emergence of writers with true working-class credentials. Barbara Foley points out, though, that Gold and his peers did not eschew various literary forms in favor of strict realism; they advocated stylistic experimentation but championed and preferred genuine proletarian authorship.Foley, Barbara. Radical Presentations: Politics and Form in U.S. Proletarian Fiction, 1929‚Äì1941. Durham, NC: Duke University Press, 1993. 54‚Äì55. Print. A substantial number of poems, short stories, journalistic pieces and quasi-autobiographical ‚Äúsketches‚Äù dominated the magazine at its onset (Richard Wright and Jack Conroy being prime examples) because the magazine stressed the presence of worker-correspondents in its pages ‚Äúto make the ‚Äòworker-writer‚Äô a reality in the American radical press‚Äù.Foley, Barbara. Radical Presentations: Politics and Form in U.S. Proletarian Fiction, 1929‚Äì1941. Durham, NC: Duke University Press, 1993. 88. This movement lauded literature considered more appealing to a working-class audience. This convergence of literary philosophy and Communist Party policy in Depression- era America was facilitated by the John Reed Club of New York City, one of the Communist Party‚Äôs affiliated literary organizations. Thus, class conflict was to expand to the literary realm and support political revolution.  Later years and demise  The New Masses featured the political art of a number of prominent radical cartoonists, including left In the 1930s New Masses entered a new phase: a magazine of leftwing political comment, its attention to literature confined to book reviews and explosive editorials aimed at non- Marxist contemporaries. For example, in 1935, John L. Spivak published two articles, ‚ÄúWall Street‚Äôs Fascist Conspiracy: Testimony that the Dickstein MacCormack Committee Suppressed‚Äù and ‚ÄúWall Street's Fascist Conspiracy: Morgan Pulls the Strings‚Äù, with a deleted portion of a congressional committee. He said there was a plot that was part of a fascist conspiracy of financiers to take over the United States, and cited the names of business leaders. Furthermore, ‚Äú[t]he proletariat Stalinists of the founding group,‚Äù according to Samuel Richard West, ‚Äúbegan applying a Marxist litmus test to every contribution; as a result, the less ideological contributors and editors began to drop away‚Äù.West, Samuel Richard. Foreword. The New Masses Index, 1926‚Äì1933. By Theodore F. Watts. Easthampton, MA: Periodyssey, 2002. 5. The magazine still included literary and artistic content until its eventual demise, just not in the same abundance as in its previous years. While this content was slowly crowded out in favor of more journalistic pieces, New Masses still influenced the leftist cultural scene. For example, In 1937 New Masses printed Abel Meeropol‚Äôs anti-lynching poem ‚ÄúStrange Fruit,‚Äù later popularized in song by Billie Holiday. The magazine also sponsored the first From Spirituals to Swing concert on 23 December 1938 at Carnegie Hall and was organized by John Hammond. Though the Great Depression caused resurgence in the American Communist movement and New Masses readership surged ‚Äì so much so that Gold and his colleagues responded by turning the magazine into a weekly publication starting in January of 1934 ‚Äì New Masses would eventually encounter competition from Partisan Review. One of its chief aims, to provide a place for creative writing of a leftist character, was gradually crowded out of New Masses by its urgent demands for political and economic discussion and strict adherence to Party doctrine. Furthermore, according to Arthur C. Ferrari, New Masses illustrates how the circumstances under which political and cultural forces converge can be temporary. By the late 1930s, New Masses strongly backed the Communist Party USA‚Äôs Popular Front movement as a response to the rise of fascism and the Spanish Civil War. More specifically, though New Masses was an official organ of the Communist Party, it lost Party support when the Party entered the Popular Front stage ‚Äì fighting the threat of fascism and global war trumped class conflict and political revolution for the foreseeable future .Ferrari, Arthur C. ‚ÄúProletarian Literature: A Case of Convergence of Political and Literary Radicalism.‚Äù Cultural Politics: Radical Movements in Modern History. Ed. Jerold M. Starr. New York: Praeger, 1985. 185-86. Though the magazine supported these aims, the 1940s brought significant philosophical and practical troubles to the publication, as it faced the ideological upheaval created by the Molotov‚ÄìRibbentrop Pact (as well as blowback from its support for the Moscow Trials), while at the same time facing virulent anti-communism and censorship during the war. In 1948, editor Betty Millard published the influential article \\"Woman Against Myth\\", which examined and explained the history of the women's movement in the United States, in the socialist movement, and in the USSR. The New Masses ceased publication later that year. In 1948, the magazine merged with another Communist quarterly to form Masses & Mainstream (1948‚Äì1963). Managing editors Mike Gold was among the most widely recognized radical literary figures associated with The New Masses. # Joseph Freeman : His reputation rests on his influential introduction to Granville Hicks‚Äôs 1935 anthology, Proletarian Literature in the United States and his 1936 account of his immigrant coming-of-age and becoming a Communist, An American Testament. During the Depression years Freeman did his most influential work as a literary theorist and cultural journalist. His 1929 essay ‚ÄúLiterary Theories,‚Äù a review essay for New Masses, and his 1938 Partisan Review article, ‚ÄúMask Image Truth‚Äù, would eventually frame his mid-decade introduction to Hicks‚Äôs anthology. Freeman strains in these essays to honor the Communist Party line and, concurrently, to resist the ideological crudity, or ‚Äúvulgar Marxism‚Äù, that often resulted from such striving. # Mike Gold (1927‚Äì1930/1): Real name Itzok Isaac Granich, the Jewish-American writer was a devout communist and abrasive left-wing literary critic. During the 1930s and 1940s, he was considered the proverbial dean of American proletarian literature. In 1925, after a trip to Moscow, he helped found New Masses, which published leftist works and set up radical theater groups. In 1928, he became the editor-in- chief. As editor, he adopted the hard-line stance to publish works by proletarian authors rather than literary leftists. Endorsing what he called ‚Äúproletarian literature,‚Äù Gold was influential in making this style of fiction popular during the depression years of the 1930s. His most influential work, Jews Without Money, a fictionalized autobiography about growing up in impoverished Manhattan, was published in 1930. # Walt Carmon (1930/1‚Äì1932) # Whittaker Chambers (1932): Chambers became a contributor in 1931 with four short stories that catapulted him to contributing editor later in 1931 and managing editor for the first half of 1932, when he received order to join the Soviet underground (see Ware Group and Alger Hiss). His name persisted in the masthead for months thereafter, perhaps as cover. # Joseph Freeman (1932‚Äì1933) # Granville Hicks (1934-1936): Influential Marxist literary critic during the 1930s. He established his intellectual reputation as an influential literary critic with the 1933 publication of The Great Tradition, an analysis of American literature from a Marxist perspective. He joined the Communist Party and became literary editor of New Masses in January 1934, the same issue New Masses became a weekly. Hicks is remembered for his well-publicized resignation from the CPUSA in 1939. # Joseph Freeman (1936‚Äì1937) See also * The Masses * The Liberator FootnotesFurther reading * Aaron, Daniel.

A guitarist with an extensive background in rock, blues, classical & Eastern music, Peros has been composing exclusively classical concert music since 1987. In 1992 Peros composed his symphony Isumataq, for full orchestra and choir, as part of an artistic collaboration with Canadian painter Ken Kirkby, whose painting \\"Isumataq\\" was the world's largest painting on canvas measuring 152 feet by 12 feet and is a portrait of the high Arctic landscape. Peros' symphony, 'Isumataq', was composed as an independent work based on the theme of the Canadian north, using the north as a metaphor and symbol for deeper, spiritual issues. The Isumataq project was recognized by the Canadian government in March 1993 as a work important for Canada and Canadian culture ‚Äì a special ceremony was held in the Canadian Parliament, House of Commons to pay homage to Isumataq and was attended by Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney, the Speaker of the House, the Party leaders and the Members of Parliament. Peros released his first CD, Motets, in 1999, on the Phoenix Records (Canada) label. Motets features 20 a cappella choral works ranging from highly polyphonic, deeply textured multi-part works, to homophonic textured and two part pieces. Motets received high praise from critics. The world premiere concert of the Motets took place September 24, 1999 at Toronto‚Äôs George Weston Recital Hall, performed by The Renaissance Singers, conducted by Richard Cunningham. Peros‚Äô second CD, Songs, was released November 2000, and features 31 songs for solo voice & piano with texts by Emily Dickinson, A.E. Housman, William Wordsworth, Robert Louis Stevenson, William Blake and, most notably, Emily Bront√´ ‚Äì 17 of the 31 songs on the CD are settings of Bront√´'s poetry, with some songs being the first time that Bront√´'s poems have been set to music. In 2002 Peros composed Prayer of Consolation, a large scale a cappella choral work composed to commemorate the events of 9-11. Featuring a Biblical text compiled by Peros to reflect a dialogue between God and Man on the events of 9-11, Prayer of Consolation received its world premiere on September 10, 2002, in Washington DC at Washington National Cathedral, performed by The Palestrina Choir, as part of the US commemorations of the First Anniversary of 9-11. The premiere received extensive media coverage across North America with portions of the concert being broadcast nationally across Canada on CBC Television as part of CBC‚Äôs First Anniversary commemorations. With almost 200 works in his catalogue, Peros‚Äô music continues to receive extensive international performance, ranging from performances of full orchestral works to choral, chamber and solo works. In 2006, five of his Poemes for solo piano were recorded by pianist Linda Shumas and included on her solo piano CD Paradise Reborn. His Cello Suite No. 1 ‚Äì Five Meditations for Solo Cello, and some of his other solo instrumental music, are also being released on CD in 2006.

In fact, it is many compendia, for Shah Abdul Latif's poetry in various forms of bayt and wai was compiled by many of his devotees during his lifetime and after his death. The devotees compiled his poetry and designated it as Shah Jo Risalo or Poetry of Shah. Ernest Trumpp called it Diwan when he edited the Risalo and published it from Leipzig, Germany in 1866 A.D. Afterwards, many scholars and linguists have published the Shah Jo Risalo with their own compilations, hence many editions are available. Shah Jo Risalo, written in very pure and concise Sindhi verses, is great storehouse for Muslims but also for the Hindus. Shah Abdul Latif has hidden his mystical ideas under layers of symbols taken from all spheres of life as well as from the classical Sufi tradition, and particularly from Maulana Rumi's Mathnawi.Annemarie Schimmel, Pearls from the Indus:Studies in Sindhi Culture Jamshoro, Sindh, Pakistan: Sindhi Adabi Board (1986). See pp. 111.  Surs (chapters)  The traditional compilations of Shah Jo Risalo include 30 Surs (chapters) which were compiled by renowned researchers. The oldest publications of Shah Jo Risalo contained some 36 Surs, but later most of the linguists discarded 6 Surs, as their language and content did not match the Shah's style. Recently, Dr. Nabi Bakhsh Baloch, a renowned linguist of the Sindhi language, has compiled and printed a new edition after 32 years of research into folk culture, language and the history of Sindhi language. Another poet Dr Aurangzeb Siyal has recently launched a book named \\"Louk Zangeer\\" in which he has attempted to define three Surs i-e Momal Rano, Sasui Punho and Umar Marvi in an easy manner and in different poetic style. The word \\"Sur\\", from Sanskrit word Svara, means a mode of singing. The Surs are sung as Ragas In Indian classical music, its \\"Ragas\\" and \\"Raginis\\" are sung at different times of day and night. In Risalo the Surs are named according to their subject matter. The underlying theme is how the individual is to cultivate the godly attributes, negate his ego so as to evolve to a better human being. The traditional 30 Surs included in Shah Jo Risalo are: * Kalyaan * Yaman Kalyaan * Khanbhaat * Suri Raag * Samundi * Sohni * Sassui Aburi * Maazuri * Desi * Kohyari * Husaini * Lilan Chanesar * Momal Rano * Marui * Kaamod * Ghattu * Sorath * Kedaro * Sarang * Asaa * Rippa * Khahori * Barwo sindhi * Ramkali * Kapati * Purab * Karayal * Pirbhati * Dahar * Bilawal * Sur Kamod These Surs contain Bayts which Shah latif sang in state of ecstasy. These Bayts in the Surs concerning the life-stories of his heroines, viz. Suhni, Sassui, Lila, Mumal, Marui, Nuri and Sorath, are not in chronological sequences, for the Sufi Poet in his state of \\"Wajd\\" or ecstasy, was concerned with the moments of denouncements in life-stories, which he used as allegories to express his mystical experiences.  Shah's Heroines  The heroines of Shah Abdul Latif Bhittai's poetry are known as the Eight queens of Sindhi folklore who have been given the status of royalty in Shah Jo Risalo. The Eight Queens are celebrated throughout Sindh for their positive qualities: honesty, integrity, piety and loyalty. They are also valued for their bravery and their willingness to risk their lives in the name of love. The Eight Queens mentioned in Shah Jo Risalo are Marui, Momal, Sassui, Sadia, Noori, Sohni, Sorath, and Lila. In his poetry Shah has alluded in elaborate way to these characters of Sindhi folktales and used them as metaphors for high spiritual life. Perhaps what Shah Abdul Latif Bhittai saw in his tales of these women was an idealized view of womanhood, but the truth remains that the Eight Queens inspired women all over Sindh to have the courage to choose love and freedom over tyranny and oppression. The lines from the Risalo describing their trials are sung at Sufi shrines all over Sindh, and especially at the urs of Shah Abdul Latif every year at Bhit Shah. These romantic tales of Bhittai are commonly known as Momal Rano, Umar Marui, Sadia Sarmad,Sohni Mehar, Lilan Chanesar, Noori Jam Tamachi, Sassui Punnhun and Sorath Rai Diach or Seven Queens () of Shah Abdul Latif Bhittai. Sassui Punnhun and Sohni Mehar aka Sohni Mahiwal in Punjabi are also celebrated in Punjab along with Heer Ranjha and Mirza Sahiban and thus form part of Punjabi traditions. These Ten tragic romances from South Asia (all from present day Pakistan) have become part of the cultural identity of Pakistan.  Translations  Shah Jo Risalo was first translated into German in 1866 by Ernest Trump, a German scholar and missionary when in 1860s he became fascinated by Sindhi language and culture and the jogis and singers who sang Shah Latif‚Äôs verses. With the help of Sindhi scholars he compiled a selection of the original verses and called it \\"Shah Jo Risalo\\" (the message of Shah). It was first translated in English by Elsa Kazi, a German lady married to Allama I. I. Kazi, who translated selections of Shah Jo Risalo in English prose. Later in 1940, Dr H.T Sorley, an English scholar learnt Sindhi, and published selections from the Risalo by the Oxford University Press entitled \\"Shah Abdul latif of Bhit - His Poetry, Life and Times\\". The most recent work (1994) of translation of Risalo into English is that of Amena Khamisani, a professor in English Literature at the Sindh University. Shaikh Ayaz, the famous Sindhi poet, translated Risalo into Urdu. Risalo is also translated in Punjabi and more recently French translation was also undertaken by Cultural department of Sindh. Part of Risalo is also translated in Arabic. There is one more translation of Shah Abdul Latif by name \\"Seeking The Beloved\\" translated by Hari Daryani 'Dilgir' a noted Sindhi poet and Anju Makhija. This book was honoured with Sahitya Akademi Award for translation in the year 2012. Agha Saleem, a renowned name in Sindhi literature, has also translated a number of 'Surs' from Risalo which are published by Sindh Culture Department.

As well as campaigning to protect playing fields and open space, Fields in Trust legally protects the King George's Fields,The National Playing Fields Association on King George's Fields 471 public recreation grounds set up as a memorial to King George V. History Marketing image created by the then National Playing Fields Association in the 1920s The charity was set up in 1925 as the National Playing Fields Association (NPFA), by Brigadier-General Reginald Kentish and was founded by the Duke of York, later King George VI, who was the first president. This royal link continues today with The Queen as Patron since 1952 and The Duke of Edinburgh as President from 1947 until he stepped down in 2013 to be succeeded by his grandson The Duke of Cambridge. Fields in Trust is a charity incorporated by Royal Charter in 1932. The organisation was awarded the Olympic Cup in 1931 by the International Olympic Committee in recognition of their work providing Playing Fields in Great Britain. The Charity‚Äôs affairs are conducted through its Council which meets quarterly to set the policy of the Association and to oversee its work. It is also linked to many bodies and membership of the organisation includes local authorities, individuals, playing field associations, schools and sports clubs. In 1972, Fields in Trust (then the NFPA) supported the Bishop of Stepney, Trevor Huddleston in denouncing the lack of play provision which had led to the deaths by drowning of 2 boys who lived in his diocese. This gave the impetus to the Fair Play for Children campaign. Fields in Trust set standards for playground provision in the UK through The 6 Acre Standard which is widely recognised as a planning tool for local authorities as a basis, when stipulating play area provision for new housing development, and in local play policies. Fields in Trust is one of the agencies represented on the UK Government School Playing Fields Advisory Panel convened by the Department for Education to scrutinise the disposal or change of use of playing fields and school land. Objectives Recommendations on Outdoor Playing Space were first formulated in 1925, soon after the Association‚Äôs formation. This was with the intention of ensuring \\"every man, woman and child in Great Britain should have the opportunity of participating in outdoor recreational activity within a reasonable distance of home during leisure hours\\". The charity urged all local authorities to adopt a minimum standard of provision of of public open space for every 1,000 people, of which at least \\"should be set aside for team games, tennis, bowls and children‚Äôs playgrounds\\". Since then, Fields in Trust have kept the recreational space standard under regular review. It now stands as the Six Acre Standard, recommending per 1,000 head of population as a minimum necessity for space. In 1992, the Association revised its recommendations on recreational space to include the Children‚Äôs Playing Space Standard aspect of the Six Acre Standard - part of the recommendation then was a general statement of the need for adequate children‚Äôs playing space. Protected Land  Fields in Trust supervises the property over which the Association acts as Guardian Trustee and ensures that it retains its charitable purpose. The Fields in Trust charity has a role in the protection of over 2,700 parks, playing fields and nature reserves across the United Kingdom. In total, the Fields in Trust's land portfolio represents an interest over . In the 1920s and 1930s many of the sites were funded by the Carnegie United Kingdom Trust on the basis that the land would be kept as public playing fields in perpetuity. In all of its work, Fields in Trust is assisted by affiliated national and county associations and other partners. King George's Field Fields in Trust is the Trustee of the King George's Fields Foundation (KGFF). The Foundation was established as a Memorial to the Late King George V by Trust Deed on 3 November 1936. The objects of the Trust were \\"to promote and to assist in the establishment throughout the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland of Playing Fields for the use and enjoyment of the people every such Playing Field to be styled ‚ÄòKing George‚Äôs Field‚Äô and to be distinguished by heraldic panels or other appropriate tablet medallion or inscription commemorative of the King\\". The Trust defined a playing field as \\"any open space used for the purpose of outdoor games, sports and pastimes\\". These playing fields have their origins in an appeal launched shortly after the death of George V in March 1936. Rather than finance the entire cost of a few schemes, grants were given towards the cost of as many fields as possible, the balance being raised by the local authority or other organisation providing the field and accepting responsibility for its maintenance. In most cases, the responsible body entered into a Deed of Dedication declaring that the recreation ground shall \\"be preserved in perpetuity as a Memorial to His Late Majesty under the provisions of the KGFF and shall henceforth be known as a 'King George‚Äôs Field'.\\" The NPFA would act, as administrator, to look at and consider proposals in order to allocate grants. A Charity Commission Scheme was made on 1 December 1965 passing the trusteeship of the Foundation to the NPFA and, among other things, widening the objects of the Foundation to include the \\"preservation\\" of the King George‚Äôs Fields. Six Acre Standard The Six Acre Standard aims to help land use planners ensure a sufficient level of open space to enable residents of all ages to participate in sports and games with an emphasis on access for children to playgrounds and other play space. The standard suggests that for each 1000 residents there should be a total of of recreational land, of which should be for outdoor sport and recreation space (including parks) and for children's play, with some of this being equipped playgrounds In its publication The Six Acre Standard, the FiT outlines a more detailed breakdown including a hierarchy of child play space. The New Six Acre Standard Fields in Trust reissued The Six Acre Standard under the new name Guidance for Outdoor Sport and Play in 2015 as an online reference work for planners in the UK. It has been updated to include the modern planning regime and new topics such as sustainability and the local environment. These areas come under the heading \\"Open Space\\" which refers to all open space, and is deemed as a community asset, and value, and is protected by legislation in the Core Strategy (2006-2026). Versions of the Guidance for the devolved administrations of Scotland and Wales were launched in January 2017 as well as a Welsh Language edition. Children's sports fields on educational land are not recorded as Open Space and are not protected by Open Space legislation. However, any change of use of educational land requires local or national government approval. The government decisions can be contested by the local community. Queen Elizabeth II Fields Challenge Plaque placed under the Fields Challenge scheme at the entrance to Chestnuts Park Queen Elizabeth II Fields Challenge, (known as the \\"Queen Elizabeth Fields Challenge\\" in Scotland), was a programme run by Fields in Trust aiming to protect outdoor recreational spaces across the UK to create a \\"grassroots legacy\\" in celebration of the 2012 Diamond Jubilee.

Life He was born in Rychnov nad Knƒõ≈ænou into the family of a Jewish merchant. He attended the gymnasium there, but did poorly, so he transferred to a secondary school in Prague, from which he graduated in 1912. He then attended the faculty of law at Charles University. He was employed as a legal clerk for a short time. During the First World War he served on the Serbian and Galician fronts. After the war he was employed by the Czechoslovak Committee on Import and Export, but lost his job after he ridiculed the office in one of his short stories called Kolotoƒç (The Carousel); about a family that inherits a carousel but, due to a hyperbureaucratic import/export office, they are not able to sell it abroad. Josef ƒåapek offered him support in 1920 and Pol√°ƒçek began contributing to a satirical magazine; Nebojsa (Dreadnought). He then started writing short stories, feature stories and columns using the pseudonym Koƒçkodan (Guenon, or Marmoset). Shortly after that, in 1922, the ƒåapek brothers introduced him to the editor of Lidov√© noviny (a popular newspaper of that time). The newspaper published his feature stories and very popular series called \\"Soudniƒçky\\" (\\"Judges\\"; generally humorous stories about the court system.). His work was published in this newspaper until the Nazi occupation came and it was forbidden under the Nuremberg Laws. He then went to work for the Jewish religious community. Near the end of 1943, he was transported to the Theresienstadt concentration camp and then transferred to Auschwitz. He died in the Gleiwitz camp. Work Memorial plaque to Pol√°ƒçek in Rychnov nad Knƒõ≈ænou His novels represent the most authentic values of Czech interwar prose. He was close to the humanistic credo of his generation of writers such as Karel ƒåapek and Franti≈°ek Langer. At the same time he reflects in his \\"humorous\\" (but only at first sight) novels the deep tragedy of the petty bourgeois, small-town and suburban world in which hypocrisy, mental smallness, narrow-mindness and spiritual poverty wins. Pol√°ƒçek was able to describe different human types - not only in their variety but also in the art of getting under the mask of their language. At the beginning of his work stand humorous sketches mostly from small-town environments, with caricatured human types, especially from middle-class, often Jewish society. His first novel was D≈Øm na p≈ôedmƒõst√≠ (1928, A House in the Suburbs) in which he portrayed the transformation of a \\"small man\\" into a dehumanised creature as soon as he is seized with the proprietary instinct to possess. He was widely popular for his humoristic prose such as Mu≈æi v offsidu (1931, Men in Offsides, which was made into a movie that year by director Svatopluk Innemann, starring Hugo Haas in the role of Mr. Naƒçeradec) or Michelup a motocykl (1935, Michelup and the Motorcycle). Much of his work was devoted to a cycle in which he portrayed a small town during the years before World War I. The story is centered around the fate of the tradesman, ≈†tƒõdr√Ω, and his sons. It was supposed to be a pentalogy; the fifth part was written but only fragments survived. The books were published in this order: Okresn√≠ mƒõsto (1936, County Town), Hrdinov√© t√°hnou do boje (1936, Heroes go to Battle), Podzemn√≠ mƒõsto (1937, Underground Town) and Vyprod√°no (1939, Sold Out). During the Nazi occupation, in 1941, Pol√°ƒçek's humorous novel Hostinec U kamenn√©ho stolu (Tavern with a Stone Table) was published under the name of the painter . It was made into a movie in 1949.

Early life Born in Winnipeg, Manitoba to Jewish parents who immigrated from Eastern Europe, he received a Bachelor of Commerce in 1962 and an LL.B. in 1966 from the University of Manitoba. Marshall was the only child. His mother, a school teacher, was Russian and his father, a Pole, a bookkeeper and merchant. They met in Canada and settled in Winnipeg, where Marshall was born during the war years. Marshall's father wanted him to be an actuary, and so Marshall pursued a bachelor's degree in commerce at the University of Manitoba, but in his final year he took a course on commercial law and became fascinated by the law and decided on the law as a career path instead. Rothstein worked in food service on a passenger train while between semesters at university. The experience of being the lowest-ranked employee while interacting with a variety of people from different backgrounds influenced the development of Rothstein's character such that he screened job applicants and clerkship candidates for life experiences that taught them the value of hard work and character. Asked about it in an interview with Canada's CPAC public affairs station, Rothstein stated: > \\"As lawyers, and as judges, we tend to live in a pretty enclosed world. Most > people in the world are out there slogging out very, very difficult physical > work - sometimes dangerous work. The experience that I had working in the > dining car made me realize that there was a different life out there and > that as a lawyer I was going to be lucky that I wasn't going to have to work > outside, and in inclement weather, or perhaps in dangerous situations, or > for that matter in the dining car. In those days we weren't allowed to sit > down, if there was even one customer in the dining car, we had to stand all > day with short breaks, and I want to make sure that my law clerks or the > people I'm working with have some idea about what that life is about.\\" Upon graduating from the University of Manitoba and passing his bar exams, Rothstein went to work for the firm of Thorvaldson, Eggerston, Saunders and Mauro. Rothstein specialized in transportation law and taught for several years at the University of Manitoba. In 1992, Brian Mulroney appointed him to the Federal Court Trial Division and in 1999 was elevated to the Federal Court of Appeal in Ottawa. In 2006, he was Stephen Harper's appointment to the Supreme Court and became the first justice to have his appointment publicly scrutinized when he appeared before a parliamentary committee. He was called to the Bar of Manitoba in 1966. Also in 1966, he married Sheila Dorfman, a Montreal doctor. They have four children: Ronald, Douglas, Tracey and Robert. Career Marshall Rothstein practiced law primarily in the fields of transportation and competition law and was a partner with the Winnipeg law firm of Aikins, MacAulay & Thorvaldson. From 1970 to 1992, he was a lecturer in transportation law at the University of Manitoba. In 1992, he was appointed to the Federal Court Trial Division, ex officio of the Court of Appeal, and appointed to the Court Martial Appeal Court of Canada. In 1999, he was appointed a Judge of the Federal Court of Canada, Appeal Division. He wrote 578 judgments for the Federal Court and 324 judgments for the Federal Court of Appeal. In 2017, he was appointed a Companion of the Order of Canada by Governor General David Johnston for \\"his eminent service as a jurist, notably on the Supreme Court of Canada, and for his dedication to legal education.\\" Supreme Court Rothstein was one of the candidates (the others being Peter MacKinnon and Constance Hunt) recommended by a committee convened by the outgoing Liberal government to be appointed to the Supreme Court of Canada, following John C. Major's retirement from the bench in early 2006. Prime Minister Stephen Harper chose Rothstein for the Governor General to appoint to the top court. Rothstein's appointment by the Conservative government was criticized because of his unilingualism. He was the only justice of the Supreme Court who was not bilingual,Tories get tongue-lashing over language policies , The Star Phoenix, accessdate 2016-02-17 prior to the 2011 appointment of Justice Michael Moldaver. Many Canadian conservatives had long been critical of the process of appointing judges to the Supreme Court of Canada, wherein the Prime Minister is the sole advisor of the Governor General in the matter, and though he or she consults legal experts, no input is given from other (especially opposition) politicians. Conservative Leader Stephen Harper had thus made a promise to \\"reform\\" the appointment process during previous elections. Shortly after Prime Minister Harper put Rothstein's name forward, Harper acted on his promise to create an Ad Hoc Committee to Review a Nominee for the Supreme Court of Canada, a new creation intended to allow the nominee to face questioning by members of the Canadian Parliament, similar in spirit to the Senate judicial hearings that occur as part of the Supreme Court appointment process in the United States. The Panel was chaired by constitutional law professor Peter Hogg. The new procedures replaced a reformed appointment process introduced by the previous Liberal government, but which had not yet been applied. The panel was controversial. Many conservative critics argued it did not go nearly far enough, while many liberal critics argued it went too far. Harper made it clear that while the ad hoc committee would be able to question the nominee, it did not have the power to veto the nominee ‚Äì unlike the American panels which had the power to do both. Furthermore, the MPs on the panel were asked to refrain from asking about Rothstein's personal opinions on moral issues or subjects of possible future rulings. One matter relating to Rothstein's judicial philosophy did emerge from the hearings, however. Though his name was drawn from a short list whose compilation had been led by the previous Liberal administration, Rothstein was generally considered to be the most conservative of the three nominees with respect to the role he believed judges play in the political system. The hearing lent support to that view: when asked about his judicial philosophy, Rothstein stated \\"I'm not sure that I would be comfortable thinking that judges should be advancing the law with a social agenda in mind. It seems to me that the social agenda is the agenda for Parliament and if Parliament wants to advance the law in social terms, that's their job.\\" Retirement On April 24, 2015, Rothstein announced his retirement from the Supreme Court, effective August 31, 2015.

Retrieved June 7, 2020 born August 5, 1956) is a former pitcher in Major League Baseball who played from 1977 through 1986 for the Detroit Tigers and Texas Rangers. Listed at 6' 4\\", 185 lb., Rozema batted and threw right-handed. He was born in Grand Rapids, Michigan. Early years and 1977 rookie season 'Rosey', as he was nicknamed, was originally selected by the San Francisco Giants in the 22nd round of the 1974 MLB Draft, but he decided to stay at school. He then played for Grand Rapids Community College in 1974 and was drafted in January 1975 by the Detroit Tigers. In 1976, Rozema played for the Montgomery Rebels in the Tigers' farm system and led the Southern League pitchers with a 1.57 earned run average. The Rebels were 86-51 in 1976 and won the league championship. Rozema debuted in the major leagues at age 20 with the Detroit Tigers in 1977. On April 21, he shut out the Boston Red Sox, 8‚Äì0, for his first major league win. He finished his rookie season with a 15-7 record and a 3.09 ERA, ending eighth in the voting for the American League Cy Young Award, while ranking third in the league in winning percentage (.682), fifth in adjusted ERA+ (138), sixth in strikeout-to-walk ratio (2.71) and eight in complete games (16). That season, Rozema finished fourth in the Rookie of the Year voting behind Baltimore Orioles' Eddie Murray, being selected by The Sporting News as the Rookie Pitcher of the Year. Besides, Rozema formed part of a distinguished group of rookies with the 1977 Tigers that included Jack Morris, Alan Trammell, Lou Whitaker, Lance Parrish and Steve Kemp. Middle years: 1978-1981 After a promising rookie year, Rozema never won more than nine games in a season. In 1978, he finished with a 9-12 record, 11 complete games and an adjusted ERA+ of 124. In 1979, he again had an above-average adjusted ERA+ of 124, but he started only 16 games and had a record of 4-4. Afterwards, Rozema's ERA fell off to a rate only slightly better than the league average, as he won six games in 1980 and five in 1981. The 1982 karate kick and reputation as an all-time Tigers character Rozema got off to a tremendous start in 1982, compiling a 3-0 record and an ERA of 1.63 (adjusted ERA+ of 248) in his first eight games. In a televised game against the Minnesota Twins on May 14, a bench-clearing brawl erupted after Twins pitchers hit both Chet Lemon and Enos Cabell. Rozema then came running out of the dugout and attempted to deliver a flying karate kick to the Twins' John Castino, but he missed Castino and tore eight ligaments in his knee. As a result, Rozema had to be carried off the field on a stretcher. He required a knee surgery the next day and was put on the disabled list for the rest of the 1982 season. In October 2006, Sports Illustrated selected Rozema as one of the \\"10 Greatest Characters in Detroit Tigers History\\". His selection was based on (1) the \\"karate kick\\" misfire, (2) a subsequent injury the same year in which Rozema fell on a flask in his back pocket and needed 11 stitches in his hip, (3) an incident in which he shoved a bar glass into the face of teammate Alan Trammell resulting in 47 stitches near Trammell's eye, (4) missing a team bus when he overslept after judging a wet T-shirt contest, and (5) using Brillo pads to wash his new car. On July 9, 2008, the minor league team in Rozema's home town, the West Michigan Whitecaps, gave away an unusual promotional item, \\"Dave Rozema Karate Kick Bobbleleg\\" figures. Later years: 1983-1986 Rozema with the Texas Rangers in 1985 Rozema came back from the injury in 1983 with an 8-3 record and 3.43 ERA in 105 innings pitched. In addition, he played on the 1984 Tigers team that won the World Series. During the regular season, he started 16 games, compiling a 7-6 record with a 3.74 ERA in 101 innings pitched, but did not appear in the post-season. On December 27, 1984, Rozema signed as a free agent with the Texas Rangers a contract for an estimated total of $500,000 to $600,000. He appeared in 34 games for the Rangers in 1985 (all but four in relief) and had a 4.19 ERA in 88 innings pitched. After compiling a 5.91 ERA at the start of the 1986 season, Rozema was released by the Rangers during the midseason. He then was signed as a free agent by the Chicago White Sox on May 20, 1986, but did not play for them. In a 10-season career, Rozema posted a 60-53 record with a 3.47 ERA in 248 pitching appearances (132 starts), striking out 448 batters while walking 258 in 1106 innings of work. Life after major league baseball In the early 1990s, Rozema pitched for the St. Petersburg Pelicans of the Senior Professional Baseball Association, and with the London Majors of the Intercounty Baseball League based in London, Ontario, Canada. On December 22, 1985, Rozema and his former teammate Kirk Gibson married sisters, JoAnn and Sandy Sklarski in a double ceremony at Grosse Pointe Memorial Church in Grosse Pointe Farms, Michigan. In 2003, Crain's Detroit Business reported that Rozema was working as a salesman for Disposal Management LLC of Bloomfield Hills, Michigan, selling the company's services to waste generators in the Detroit area.

His apical ancestor Mgbawa had moved from Umulolo, Eziama Ntigha, Abia State: Nigeria, in about the last quarter of the 17th century to settle in their present Nbawsi homeland. His paternal grandfather Wachuku Ogbaraegbe, a distinguished statesman and Merchant Prince was involved in the oil trade of that time with King Jaja of Opobo. It was in memory of the friendship, partnership and association of the Wachuku family with King Jaja of Opobo that he was named Jaja.

On the eve of his departure from New York, the Prime Minister Sir Abubakar Tafawa Balewa invited Wachuku to his hotel suite and told him that he was leaving him behind as Leader of the Delegation and Ambassador plus Permanent Representative of Nigeria to the United Nations. Wachuku protested to Prime Minister Balewa ‚Äì saying that he did not join the Delegation with the intention of staying in New York, and that he told his wife, Rhoda, that he would be away for only one week. Balewa replied: \\"Never mind, I will tell her when I arrive Lagos.\\" At the United Nations, he soon stood out in excellence and visionary, selfless service to his country Nigeria and the rest of humankind. It was during this period that Time and Jet magazine\\"Wachuku Attacks Big Powers, South Africa\\", Jet, 26 October 1961. commendably quoted Wachuku as saying ‚Äì from the rostrum of the United Nations General Assembly: \\"I am losing confidence in the great powers. They are climbing from the pedestal of greatness to the pedestal of insanity. We expect leadership from them; they give us destruction. We expect wisdom from them; they give us lack of knowledge....\\" He was lambasting the Eastern and Western Blocs for not ending their differences and quarrels. Under Wachuku's leadership at the United Nations, both the Nigerian Army and the Nigerian Police Force made their d√©but in international peacekeeping ‚Äì under the auspices of the World Organization. During his time at the United Nations, Nigeria's Major-General Johnson Thomas Umunnakwe Aguiyi Ironsi was appointed Commander of the United Nations Peacekeeping Force in the Congo. Also, the first Nigerian Permanent Secretary, Mr. Francis Nwokedi was retained by the United Nations to help in the reorganisation of the Civil Service in the Congo. Wachuku also secured the appointment of the first African Under- Secretary-General of the United Nations ‚Äì Nigeria's Godfrey K. J. Amachree ‚Äì who became UN Under Secretary-General for Trusteeship and Non-Self-Governing Territories. Jaja Wachuku with US President John F. Kennedy and Martin Luther King, Jr. First foreign affairs minister From 1961 to 1965, Wachuku was the First substantive Nigerian Minister for Foreign Affairs and Commonwealth Relations, later called External Affairs. Before Wachuku's tenure, Sir Abubakar Tafawa Balewa, the then Prime Minister, doubled as Foreign Affairs advocate of Nigeria from 1960 to 1961 when he created an official Foreign Affairs and Commonwealth Relations ministerial position in favour of Mr. Wachuku as pioneer Minister.Ebony, October 1961, p. 28. Concerning Jaja Wachuku becoming Minister for Foreign Affairs and Commonwealth Relations, in an intricate and revealing despatch, from last British Governor-General of Nigeria: Sir James Wilson Robertson to The Right Honourable: Iain Macleod: 14 October 1959 to 9 October 1961 Secretary of State for the Colonies, within \\"British Documents on the End of Empire: Moving to Independence: 1953-1960: Preparing for Independence: Political Situation: Despatch No. 53 from Sir J. Roberston to Mr. Macleod: Reviewing the End of British Rule in Nigeria and Prospects for the Future: 15 September 1960,\\" Sir Robertson, wrote: \\"11. It seems unlikely that the Prime Minister will make many changes in his Cabinet on independence. I believe he intends to recommend Mr. Jaja Wachuku to me to be the Foreign Minister; not Mallam Maitama Sule, who has been rumoured as a possibility. Mr. Wachuku is a lawyer from the Eastern Region and is at present Speaker of the House of Representatives. He is an intelligent young man who has held somewhat extreme nationalist views, but is now settling down. If the Prime Minister can keep him in reasonable control, he might do very well. He will probably associate with him a Northerner as Minister of State.\\"British Documents on the End of Empire Project: Volume 7: Nigeria: In two Parts: 2001: SAS: University of London, \\"British Documents on the End of Empire Project\\", School of Advanced Study: University of London: https://sas-space.sas.ac.uk: 2001 On 14 July 1962, he was decorated with the insignia of the \\"Commander of the Order of the Niger Republic\\" in recognition of \\"services to the People of the Republic of Niger\\" by President Hamani Diori. As Foreign Affairs Minister, Jaja Wachuku organised the Afro/Asian group of States and worked to get Liberia voted into the United Nations Security Council, and Ethiopia into the Economic and Social Council. He also worked towards the amendment of the United Nations Charter ‚Äì increasing the Security Council from eleven to fifteen ‚Äì taking into account African nations. It was concerning this period in Nigeria's history that Ambassador Owen W. Roberts, United States' 1964 to 1965 Political Officer in Lagos, Nigeria strikingly said: \\"The Nigerians, whatever their tribe, are a very strong, very assertive group. Foreign Minister Jaja Wachuku was a surprise for many American diplomats because he considered himself as having a status equivalent to the British, French, German, or Russian Ministers. Wachuku demanded that much attention and respect. The Nigerians were, and have been, very independent. Senior U.S. echelons weren't used to dealing with Africans as assertive and as strong minded as the Nigerians were. I found this nice because the Nigerians were absolutely always open with you, and would hit you over the head with whatever the problem was. They were entitled to respect and helped gain it for Africans. Ambassador Matthews was not the kind of person to go in and tell Prime Minister Balewa or Foreign Minister Jaja Wachuku how to do things....\\" Jaja Wachuku as Foreign Affairs Minister of Nigeria preferred quiet consultation, especially with the two major Anglo-American powers: Great Britain and the United States ‚Äì in search of solutions to continental and international problems. For example, there was a lot of hue and cry as a result of the Rivonia Trial in South Africa in 1963 following the arrest of Walter Sisulu, Ahmed Kathrada, Govan Mbeki, Denis Goldberg, Raymond Mhlaba, Andrew Mlangeni, Lionel Bernstein and others. They and Nelson Mandela, who was serving term on his 1962 conviction, were charged with \\"sabotage and ... conspiracy to overthrow the Government by revolution and by assisting an armed invasion of South Africa by foreign troops.\\" These charges were treasonable and carried the death penalty. Jaja Wachuku quietly invited Lord Head, the British High Commissioner in Lagos and also United States' Ambassador Joseph Palmer II ‚Äì and strongly urged them to intercede with their governments to prevail on the apartheid regime in South Africa ‚Äì not to impose the death penalty on Nelson Mandela and others. Wachuku employed the same quiet diplomacy on the matter with US Secretary of State Dean Rusk and British Foreign Secretary Lord Home. Subsequently, Lionel Bernstein was acquitted and Mandela and the rest were given life imprisonment terms. Humane and successful diplomatic efforts by Jaja Wachuku to save Mandela and others from death penalty at the Rivonia Trial were given more light by University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill Henry Brandis Professor of Law Emeritus: Kenneth S. Broun,\\"Kenneth S. Broun, Henry Brandis Professor of Law Emeritus\\", UNC School of Law. in his published book: Saving Nelson Mandela: The Rivonia Trial and the Fate of South Africa (Oxford University Press, USA, 2012).Saving Nelson Mandela: The Rivonia Trial and the Fate of South Africa (Pivotal Moments in World History), Oxford University Press, USA, 9 February 2012. Amazon. Professor Broun points out that Sir Hugh Stephenson: United Kingdom's Ambassador to South Africa met with Foreign Minister Hilgard Muller of South Africa with regard to \\"the Wachuku request\\" that Mandela and others must not be sentenced to death. When Stephenson mentioned Wachuku's stand to Muller, Muller responded by saying that Wachuku's position was \\"very interesting.\\" Muller went on to say that the South African government had utmost respect for Wachuku and that at the United Nations General Assembly, Wachuku had made a oneness-of-humankind, \\"helpful speech\\" wherein Wachuku stated that \\"white people were also Africans.\\" Afterwards, Stephenson reported to the British government and Wachuku that his impression was that \\"death sentences would not be carried out\\" on Nelson Mandela and others based on the request by Wachuku.Kenneth S. Broun, Saving Nelson Mandela, OUP, 2012, p. 111. Jaja Wachuku and Golda Meir: Prime Minister of Israel Jaja Wachuku, like Hegel's historical individual, had the capacity to stand outside the confines of his time, place and intuiting history. He sought his vindication in historical reality. The Right Honourable Prime Minister Sir Abubakar Tafawa Balewa recognised and appreciated Wachuku's outstanding essence; and used to tell him that he was ten or more years ahead of his Government cabinet colleagues. Wachuku's uncanny historical intuition was evident from the start when, in 1947, he proclaimed Lagos an All-Nigerian city ‚Äì long before that city became a federal territory. Wachuku also foresaw the danger of recognising military coup as a way to change government. In Ethiopia, he strongly refused to accord recognition to the Nicolas Grunitzky Government in Togo after 13 January 1963 first coup in that country. Wachuku believed that if that first African coup by the Togolese army was recognised as a way to change government, then, coup- making would spread in Africa.Klaas van Walraven, Dreams of Power: The Role of the Organization of African Unity in the Politics of Africa, 1963‚Äì1993, University of Michigan, Ashgate, 1999, pp. 133, 137. In Addis Ababa, during the Inaugural Conference of the Organization of African Unity (OAU), Emperor Haile Selassie I of Ethiopia sat Wachuku down in the presence of Prime Minister Abubakar Tafawa Balewa and begged Balewa to plead with his \\"Foreign Minister Jaja Wachuku\\" to accept that the Togolese government be admitted to take part in that first OAU Conference. Wachuku jokingly reminded Emperor Haile Selassie and Prime Minister Balewa that he was only number three in the Nigerian Government, and that coup plotters go for numbers one and two ‚Äì President or Head of State and Prime Minister. Jaja Wachuku added that by the time coup makers got to number three, he would be resting in his village. At the end, Wachuku refused to change his diplomatic position of not allowing Togo to participate because the Togolese Government came to power by coup. Therefore, Togo became the only independent African country that was not represented at the Inaugural Conference of the OAU. History has already told us whether Wachuku was right or wrong. Even Kwame Nkrumah who was one of the most vocal supporters of the Togolese government of coup makers, later fell victim of the coup contagion. As for Jaja Wachuku, he had resigned from the Nigerian parliament and government at midday of 14 January 1966 ‚Äì twelve hours before the first Nigerian military coup of 15 January 1966 led by Major Chukwuma Kaduna Nzeogwu. Jaja Wachuku and president Dwight D. Eisenhower of the United States In a public lecture titled \\"Nigeria: The Blackman's Burden\\", delivered on 24 February 2005 at the Nigerian Institute of International Affairs (NIIA) to mark the 28th Anniversary of the Black and African Festival of Arts and Culture (FESTAC) and the 2005 Black History Month, it was also concerning Wachuku at the founding period in Nigeria's Foreign Policy that Professor Bolaji Akinyemi (1985 to 1987 Nigerian External Affairs Minister) said: \\"Karl Marx must have had Togo in mind when he wrote in the Eighteenth Brumaire of Louis Napoleon, \\"Hegel says somewhere that all great events and personalities in world history reappear in one fashion or another. He forgot to add: the first time as tragedy, the second as farce\\". In 1963, when President Sylvanus Olympio was assassinated, Jaja Wachuku, the Nigerian Foreign Minister in condemning the action added that for security reasons, Nigerian boundary was the Togo‚ÄìGhana boundary.Ali Al ºAmin Mazrui; Robert L. Ostergard (ed.), Power, Politics, and the African Condition: Collected essays of Ali A. Mazrui, Vol. 3, Africa World Press, 2004, p. 273. He was roundly condemned. Looks like he was just speaking forty years out of turn. He would be pleased to know that Nigeria had caught up with him. And that should also be a lesson to those who think that Nigerian foreign policy started and ended up with them.\\"Bolaji Akinyemi, \\"Nigeria ‚Äì The Blackman's Burden\\". Public lecture delivered on 24 February 2005. As Foreign Affairs Minister, Wachuku attended the Philadelphia third annual conference of the American Society of African Culture (AMSAC) held in 1960. Concerning Wachuku at that AMSAC conference, The Cambridge History of Africa Volume 8 c. 1940-c. 1975 said: \\"Continuing interest among the black intelligentsia in African culture was signalled by the creation of the American Society of African Culture (AMSAC) in 1956, which restricted membership to persons of African descent.... Its third annual conference, in Philadelphia in 1960, devoted itself to the discussion of \`African Unities and Pan-Africanism', and can be regarded as an event in the history of the movement. Some of those present had strong links with the Pan-Africanist past, notably Rayford W. Logan, who had played an important part in the era of Pan-African congresses after the First World War; Jean Price-Mars, Haitian diplomat, philosopher of n√©gritude, and President of the Soci√©t√© Africaine de Culture in Paris; and Jaja Wachuku, who had been at the 1945 Pan-African Congress, and who was in 1960 foreign Minister of Nigeria....\\"Michael Crowder, The Cambridge History of Africa, Volume 8 c. 1940-c. 1975, Cambridge University Press, 1984, p. 107. Aviation minister and 1966 coup Subsequently, from 1965 to midday 14 January 1966, Wachuku was Nigeria's minister of aviation.\\"Nigerian Official Studies U.U., U.K. Jets\\", Aviation Week & Space Technology, Volume 83, McGraw-Hill, 1965, p. 43. With most of the aviation laws in Nigeria bearing his signature, Wachuku initiated training programmes for Nigeria's first crop of Flight and Ground Officers. The Aviation Training Centre, Zaria was established during his tenure. Notably, Wachuku's visionary and upright zeal, however, did not go well with his party, the NCNC ‚Äì a party which saw Mr. A. K. Blankson, Nigeria Airways Board chairman and also the party's Central Working Committee chairman, as representing NCNC's interest in the spoils system. From the Chairmanship of the Nigeria Airways Board, Wachuku fired and removed Blankson who felt himself beyond ministerial control. His party, the NCNC demanded the reinstatement of Blankson ‚Äì otherwise the party would withdraw its Ministers from the coalition government. Thus, Nigeria was faced with a potential crisis which would have compounded the already grave state of emergency in the country. The Prime Minister, Sir Abubakar Tafawa Balewa, who had high respect and a soft spot for Jaja Wachuku pleaded with him to reinstate the Nigeria Airways Board chairman and accept another ministry. Wachuku refused. Balewa even asked his wife Rhoda Idu Jaja Wachuku to plead with him, yet he refused and tendered his resignation from Parliament and as an Executive Member of Government midday 14 January 1966. Balewa was yet to accept Wachuku's resignation when the army struck by mid-night; barely 12 hours later ‚Äì thus ushering in the era of military coups in Nigeria. Wachuku's official residence, at 7, Okotie-Eboh Street Ikoyi, Lagos, Nigeria, was surrounded by soldiers. His younger brother: Kennedy Madu Wachuku, father of Ugonna WachukuUgonna Wachuku website. was with him that day, Jaja Wachuku looked through the window in the early hours of the morning and asked the soldiers: \\"What are you boys doing here?\\" One of the soldiers replied: \\"Good morning, Sir. But haven't you heard what is happening in the country?\\" To which Wachuku replied: \\"Yes. I know you boys have taken over the Government.\\" And the soldier said: \\"Do not be afraid, Sir. We have come to protect you for being an honest Government Minister.\\"Ajiroba Yemi Kotun, \\"Everydog has his day\\", The Nigerian Voice, 2 July 2013. Jaja Wachuku survived the military coup. Civil war in Nigeria Jaja Anucha Wachuku retired to his home town, first to Aba and subsequently to Nbawsi, his village when Aba fell during the Nigerian ‚Äì Biafran war that lasted from July 1967 to January 1970. During the Biafran war, he participated in the struggle of his Igbo people for freedom and justice against a country that had rejected them by not protecting them from genocide and brutality by its marauding soldiers and citizens. Later, during the war, Wachuku fell out with the Government of Chukwuemeka Odumegwu Ojukwu because he spoke out against the recruitment of child soldiers. He was arrested and detained by the Ojukwu Government. And was, at the end of the Biafran war released by a young Nigerian Army Officer called Theophilus Danjuma. The Nigerian soldiers were shocked and dismayed that their first Speaker of the House of Representatives, first Ambassador to the United Nations and first Foreign Affairs Minister was in detention for exercising his freedom of speech and fundamental human rights. So, Theophilus Danjuma and his military battalion gave Jaja Wachuku adequate protection and security. Wachuku was escorted home by Nigerian soldiers. And he managed to prevent the looting and destruction of his amazing, vast library located at his country home in Nbawsi Abia State, Nigeria. Wachuku's library was described as the biggest one man library in West Africa by regional and national media. Prime Minister Abubakar Tafawa Balewa used to call Jaja Wachuku the most \\"Bookish Minister\\". After the Biafran war, Wachuku was involved in Community development affairs while practising his law profession. From 1970 to 1978, he served as Chairman of Nbawsi and Umuomainta Town Council, and also chairman Nsulu Community Council. He was also a Founding Member of the Movement for the creation of Imo State, and leader, until his death, of the Movement for the creation of Aba State. Second Republic politics Jaja Wachuku During Nigeria's second republic ‚Äì 1979 to 1984, Jaja Wachuku was, on the platform of the Nigerian Peoples Party (NPP), twice (1978 and 1983) elected Senator representing Aba Senatorial Zone of Africa's most populous country. At the Senate of Nigeria, he became NPP Leader and Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.Joel Peters, Israel and Africa: The Problematic Friendship, I.B. Tauris Publishers, 1992, p. 98. During this period, he made various dangerous secret trips to South Africa for meetings with President Pieter Willem Botha to put pressure on him for the dismantling of the obnoxious apartheid system; including the unconditional pardon and release of Nelson Mandela and other political prisoners. It was during this period that, on the floor of the Nigerian Senate, Wachuku made his famous, prophetic statement that the defeat of apartheid in South Africa \\"shall flow from the barrels of dialogue and contact, not from the barrels of isolation and guns...\\". He was later removed from the Foreign Relations Committee because of officially calling for dialogue with South Africa. During the 1990 years, when Nigeria started diplomatic relations with South Africa, most prominent politicians and historians in the country called for an apology to Jaja Wachuku. In 1983, he was re-elected to the Nigerian Senate until the Muhammadu Buhari military coup of December 1983. Honours and awards Jaja Wachuku received many honours during his lifetime. In Nigeria, he was the holder of the chieftaincy title of Ugo Ngwa meaning Eagle and Pride of Ngwa People. This title was first conferred on him by the entire Ngwa nation in 1949, but he was only able to be formally invested in 1971. Other honours included: City of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania Blue Seal, Key to the City of Atlanta, Georgia, Time \\"Pride of Africa\\" Commendation, Commander of the Order of Niger Republic, CFR Nigeria: Commander of the Order of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, LL.D: Doctor of Laws Honoris Causa by Trinity College, University of Dublin, Ireland, KSC: Knight of Saint Christopher by the Anglican Church Nigeria, Enyi Abia (Elephant of Abia, symbolizing wisdom, memory and strength) - an Abia State chieftaincy title; plus a Merit Award by the Government of Abia State, Nigeria. Posthumous special Golden Jubilee Independence Anniversary Award was conferred on Wachuku by President Goodluck Jonathan of Nigeria on 30 September 2010. Hero of the Struggle for Nigeria's Independence from Great Britain and a Pioneer Political Leader Honour for Wachuku by President Jonathan on 28 February 2014 during Nigeria's 100-year anniversary celebrations. Friday 6 March 2020 \\"Prominent Portrait\\" Honour from College Historical Society: Trinity College Dublin: University of Dublin: Ireland on Two Hundred and Fifty Years Anniversary of the College's Historical Society: 1770-2020. Death Born in 1918, Wachuku was 78 years on his death at the University of Nigeria Teaching Hospital [UNTH] Enugu, Nigeria, during the late morning of Thursday, 7 November 1996. Jaja Wachuku was an uncle of Ugonna Wachuku ‚Äì Geneva, Switzerland and Mexico City, Mexico based Nigerian author and communications professional.Ugonna Wachuku The author's poetic dedication to his uncle is titled: Some Memories Never Die.Ugonna Wachuku On 20 October 1961, in its \\"The World\\" Section, Time wrote an article and news report on Jaja Wachuku and his diplomatic activities at the United Nations entitled \\"Pride of Africa.\\"United Nations: Pride of Africa, Time, 20 October 1961.

The suburb is perhaps best known for being the childhood home of the Gibb brothers, who later became famous as the Bee Gees. \\"Cribbie\\", as it was known by the locals, consisted of two areas which were made up of Cribb Island and Jackson's Estate. The entire area of Cribb Island which was about long and 400 metres wide was built essentially on a mud flat that faced Moreton Bay. In the 1970s, the land was resumed by the Federal Government to expand the Brisbane Airport's capability for the larger jets ('Heavies') used in international flights. Cribb Island also gave its name to a local variety of marine worm (probably Onuphis sp. Fam. Eunicidae), popular with fishermen as bait. History Cribb Island (centre north), 1889 The original area of Cribb Island was populated in 1884 by a tribe of approximately 50 Indigenous Australian people, who bartered their locally-caught fish and mud crabs for bread and potatoes from the early European settlers. Cribb Island received its name from John George Cribb (1830‚Äî1905). He was the son of Robert Cribb, an alderman of the Town of Brisbane and member of the Queensland Legislative Assembly. John George Cribb bought of land from the Queensland Government in 1863. In 1885, Cribb sold 65 of those acres to James Jackson for the purpose of growing bananas. This area became known as Jackson's Estate. The land that wasn't used by Jackson was leased out to livestock farmers. Historically, there was only one road into Cribb Island. At first, as this road was floated on top of logs across the mud-flat, it was susceptible to flooding and brief periods of inaccessibility. In 1914 an improved road was built, allowing for access by standard motor vehicles. Cribb Island State School opened on 18 August 1919 and closed on 14 December 1979. It was located on Cribb Island Road at approximately with the camping reserve immediately to its south. Later on through the 1920s, the Cribb Island and Jackson's Estate areas became a tourist destination and seaside resort area due to their close proximity to Brisbane's town centre. Cribb Island Post Office opened in November 1920 and closed in 1980. In 1925, Cribb Island had its first bus service which was privately owned and ferried passengers to and from the city. Going into the 1930s the town had many essential services including a school, general store, caf√©s etc. The resident population fluctuated around 400. The 1930s however saw a change in the area's fortunes as it was at the mercy of a severe economic downturn. House owners were forced to sell their houses in the Cribb Island area to make ends meet and sold them for next to nothing. The poor bought these homes and the area became a haven for those struggling to get by. Although more local business moved in to provide basic services, this demographic remained the status quo until the end of the suburb's existence. Cribb Island was the childhood home of Bee Gees pop stars Barry, Robin and Maurice Gibb. In 1970, the Commonwealth Government proceeded to resume land on the island for the purpose of upgrading the airport. The population at that time was about 900 people. Over the next decade, people slowly moved out of the area as the Government took control of the land. The last resident unwillingly left her home in 1980. On 22 September 1986 the Queensland Government decided to remove the names Cribb Island and Lower Nudgee from the official maps because \\"no trace of either suburb remains\\". Many former residents are keeping memories of Cribb Island alive on various websites and writer Tracy Wills has written a book, On the Flats: The Road to Cribb Island, about childhood experiences growing up in this remote peaceful community. Today little remains of Cribb Island as the land was reclaimed and extensively redeveloped as part of Brisbane Airport, with the new runway which now appears over the former suburb being officially completed in 2020.

Debora got her surname from her family adopting their ancestor Iyallwahawa's \\"first\\" name written at the time as Ayiel. Early life She was born in 1954 in Soap Lake, Washington, but grew up in Fresno, California. In 1969, at age fourteen, Iyall joined the Occupation of Alcatraz and stayed for six days. She had hoped to connect with the Native American activist community there, but felt \\"out of place\\". Romeo Void While attending the San Francisco Art Institute, she joined Frank Zincavage and Peter Woods to create Romeo Void in 1979.Debora Iyall interview The band was remarkable for their modernization of the punk sound, and for Iyall's forceful, half-spoken delivery. They reached hit status on college radio stations with the suggestive and multi-leveled song \\"Never Say Never\\" in 1982. Their song \\"A Girl in Trouble (Is a Temporary Thing)\\" landed them in the top 40 of Billboard's Hot 100 chart, and an appearance on Dick Clark's American Bandstand in 1984. Solo albums and art career Romeo Void parted ways in 1985, and the following year Iyall released her debut solo album Strange Language on Columbia Records. After a lukewarm reception of the album, Iyall returned to her first love, as an artist and art instructor. Throughout the 1990s she taught art at the 29 Palms Cultural Center and for the Arts Council For San Bernardino. She also led hikes and made presentations for the Agua Caliente Cultural Museum as a paid docent, and in 1995 she started Ink Clan, a print shop dedicated to teaching screen printing and other arts to young Native artists. Ink Clan was once housed in the South of Market Cultural Center in San Francisco. She presently resides in Sacramento, California, with her husband, audio engineer and instructor Patrick Haight. Since late 2009, Iyall has been performing new material written with Peter Dunne at a variety of local venues in Northern California. In 2010 Iyall's second solo album, Stay Strong was released, and in January 2012, an EP, Singing Until Sunrise was released. On 2 November 2019, Debora Iyall was awarded as a Lifetime Achievement Honoree at the 19th Annual Native American Music Awards.

It is a musical cryptogram in the manner of the BACH motif, consisting of the notes D, E flat, C, B natural, or in German musical notation D, Es, C, H (pronounced as \\"De-Es-Ce-Ha\\"), thus standing for the composer's initials in German transliteration: D. Sch. (Dmitri Schostakowitsch). Usage=By Shostakovich The motif occurs in many of his works, including: * Symphony No. 8 in C minor, Op. 65 * Violin Concerto No. 1 in A minor, Op. 77 * Fugue No. 15 in D-flat major, Op. 87 (only once, in the stretto) * String Quartet No. 5 in B-flat major, Op. 92 * Symphony No. 10 in E minor, Op. 93 * String Quartet No. 6 in G major, Op. 101 (Played all at once by the four instruments at the end of each movement) * Cello Concerto No. 1 in E flat major, Op. 107 * String Quartet No. 8 in C minor, Op. 110 (appears in every single movement) * Symphony No. 15 in A major, Op. 141. * Piano Sonata No. 2 in B minor, Op. 61 (questionable) By others Before Shostakovich used the motif, it was used by Mozart in measures 16 and 18 of his String Quartet no. 19 in C major, K. 465 in the first violin part. Many homages to Shostakovich (such as Schnittke's Prelude in memory of Dmitri Shostakovich or Tsintsadze's 9th String Quartet) make extensive use of the motif. The British composer Ronald Stevenson composed a large Passacaglia on it. Also Edison Denisov dedicated some works (1969 DSCH for clarinet, trombone, cello and piano, and his 1970 saxophone sonata) to Shostakovich, by quoting the motif several times and using it as the first four notes of a twelve-tone series. Denisov was Shostakovich's prot√©g√© for a long time. Benjamin Britten's Rejoice in the Lamb (1943) contains the DSCH motif repeated several times in the accompaniment, progressively getting louder each time, finally at fortissimo over the chords accompanying \\"And the watchman strikes me with his staff\\". The vocal text given to the motif is \\"silly fellow, silly fellow, is against me\\". A further reference appears in Britten's The Rape of Lucretia (1946), where the DSCH motif acts as the main structural component of Lucretia's aria \\"Give him this orchid.\\" The DSCH motif also appears in the orchestral accompaniment of Viola Concerto (Walton) - (1929) in bars 115-116 (up a minor 6th - 'B', 'C', 'A', 'G#') and in 122-123 (at the original pitch - 'D', 'Eb', 'C', 'B') of the First Movement (Andante Comodo) and, during the orchestral tutti before the Recapitulation of the same movement. This has never been confirmed by William Walton (a contemporary of Shostakovich) himself, although he did refer to Dmitri Shostakovich as \\"the greatest composer of the 20th century\\"\\"British Composers in Interview\\" by R Murray Schafer (Faber 1960). Therefore, it is entirely possible that this was an intentional reference to the motif. The contemporary Italian composer Lorenzo Ferrero made use of it in DEsCH, a composition for oboe, bassoon, piano and orchestra written in 2006 to commemorate the 100th anniversary of Shostakovich's birth, and in Op.111 ‚Äì Bagatella su Beethoven (2009), which blends themes from the Piano Sonata No. 32 in C minor, Op. 111 by Ludwig van Beethoven with the Shostakovich musical monogram. The motif was also incorporated by Chumbawamba in \\"Hammer, Stirrup and Anvil\\" (2009), their song about Shostakovich's career under Stalin. Danny Elfman, in his Russian influenced score for the 1995 film Dolores Claiborne, opened the film with the DSCH motif and, subsequently, used it throughout as a nod to Schostakovich's 8th String Quartet (which he cites on his Oct 10, 2006 Apple iTunes playlist as \\"Simply one of the most beautiful, exquisitely sad, and soulful pieces of music I've ever heard\\"). DSCH Journal, the standard journal of Shostakovich studies, takes its name from the motif. \\"DSCH\\" is sometimes used as an abbreviation of Shostakovich's name. DSCH Publishers is a Moscow publishing house that published the 150-volume New Collected Works of Dmitri Shostakovich in 2005, 25% of which contained previously unpublished works.

Full-custom design is limited to ICs that are to be fabricated in extremely high volumes, notably certain microprocessors and a small number of ASICs.

Although he served as Congressional Representative, today he is mostly remembered for fathering the two children of the young slave Harriet Jacobs, in whose autobiography, Incidents in the Life of a Slave Girl, he features prominently. Early life Sawyer was born in Edenton, North Carolina, in 1800. He attended Edenton Academy and the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. Sawyer studied law, was admitted to the bar, and commenced practice in Edenton. Political career Sawyer was elected to the North Carolina State house of representatives, serving from 1829-1832. Sawyer was elected to the North Carolina Senate in 1834. He was elected in 1836 as a Whig to the Twenty-fifth Congress (March 4, 1837 - March 3, 1839), where he was chairman of the Committee on Expenditures on Public Buildings. Sawyer was an unsuccessful candidate for reelection to the Twenty-sixth Congress, moved to Norfolk, Virginia, and resumed the practice of law. He was editor of the Norfolk Argus for several years. He was appointed a collector of customs at Norfolk on May 16, 1853, serving until April 6, 1858. Sawyer moved to Washington, D.C. During the Civil War, he was appointed on September 17, 1861, as commissary with the rank of major in the Confederate service. He served until August 2, 1862. Personal life As a young man, before he married, Sawyer had a relationship with an enslaved black woman, Harriet Jacobs, who was seeking protection from her master, Dr. James Norcom of Edenton. They had two children together, Joseph and Louisa, who were enslaved at birth, according to law, which transferred the mother's status as free or enslaved to her children.\\"Harriet Jacobs\\", PBS, accessed 21 April 2009.

D-Type modified to be used in competition. The MG D-type \\"Midget\\" is a sports car that was produced by MG in 1931 and 1932. It used the engine from the MG M-type in the chassis from the MG C-type and was only available as a four-seater. Of the 250 cars produced, 208 were open tourers, 37 were salonettes and five went to external coachbuilders. The car used the M-Type 847 cc engine that was derived from the overhead camshaft engine from the 1928 Morris Minor and Wolseley 10 with a single SU Carburettor producing at 4500 rpm. Drive was to the rear wheels through a three-speed non-synchromesh gearbox with a four-speed gearbox was an option on later cars. The chassis came from the C-Type and took the form of a ladder frame with tubular cross members and passed under the rear axle. The suspension used half-elliptic springs and Hartford friction shock absorbers with rigid front and rear axles and centre lock wire wheels, the brakes were cable operated with ) drums. At ), ) after the first 100 cars, the wheelbase was longer than the C-Type to cater for the larger body, but the track remained the same at ). In spite of its looks the car was not very fast, being just possible in the tourer, the body being really too much for the small engine. The cars are quite rare today, many having been converted into C-Type replicas. At the same time as the D-Type was being made MG was also offering the 6-cylinder 1271 cc F-Type, and externally the two are virtually identical. The extra power of the F-Type made it a much better car, and it proved a bigger seller. Gallery File:MG D-Type 1931.jpgM.G. D-Type 4-Seater Tourer 1931 File:MG D-Type 1932 2.jpgM.G.

Galley proofs may be uncut and unbound, or in some cases electronically transmitted. They are created for proofreading and copyediting purposes, but may also be used for promotional and review purposes. First galley proof of A la recherche du temps perdu: Du c√¥t√© de chez Swann with handwritten revision notes by Marcel Proust Bill Hosokawa pulling a galley proof while working as a newspaper editor in the Heart Mountain Relocation Center, 1943  Historical galley proofs  Proof, in the typographical sense, is a term that dates to around 1600. The primary goal of proofing is to create a tool for verification that the job is accurate. All needed or suggested changes are physically marked on paper proofs or electronically marked on electronic proofs by the author, editor, and proofreaders. The compositor, typesetter, or printer receives the edited copies, corrects and re-arranges the type or the pagination, and arranges for the press workers to print the final or published copies. Galley proofs or galleys are so named because in the days of hand-set letterpress printing in the 1650s, the printer would set the page into galleys, namely the metal trays into which type was laid and tightened into place. A small proof press would then be used to print a limited number of copies for proofreading. Galley proofs are thus, historically speaking, galleys printed on a proof press. From the printer's point of view, the galley proof, as it originated during the era of hand-set physical type, had two primary purposes, those being to check that the compositor had set the copy accurately (because sometimes individual pieces of type did get put in the wrong case after use) and that the type was free of defects (because type metal is comparatively soft, so type can get damaged). Once a defect-free galley proof was produced, the publishing house requested a number of galley proofs to be run off for distribution to editors and authors for a final reading and corrections to the text before the type was fixed in the chase for printing.  Uncorrected proofs  An uncorrected proof is a proof version (on paper or in digital form) which is yet to receive final author and publisher approval. The term may also appear on the covers of advance reading copies; see below. These days, because much typesetting and pre-press work is conducted digitally and transmitted electronically, the term uncorrected proof is more common than the older term galley proof, which refers exclusively to a paper proofing system. However, if a paper print-out of an uncorrected proof is made on a desk-top printer or copy machine and used as a paper proof for authorial or editorial mark-up, it approximates a galley proof, and it may be referred to as a galley. Preliminary electronic proof versions are also sometimes called digital proofs, pdf proofs, and pre- fascicle proofs, the last because they are viewed as single pages, not as they will look when gathered into fascicles or signatures for the press.  Final proofs  Proofs created by the printer for approval by the publisher before going to press are called final proofs. At this stage in production, all mistakes are supposed to have been corrected and the pages are set up in imposition for folding and cutting on the press. To correct a mistake at this stage entails an extra cost per page, so authors are discouraged from making many changes to final proofs, while last-minute corrections by the in-house publishing staff may be accepted. In the final proof stage, page layouts are examined closely. Additionally, because final page proofs contain the final pagination, if an index was not compiled at an earlier stage in production, this pagination facilitates compiling a book's index and correcting its table of contents.  Advance reading copies  Historically, some publishers have used paper galley proofs as advance copies or advance reading copies (ARCs) or as pre-publication publicity proofs. These are provided to reviewers, magazines, and libraries in advance of final publication. These galleys are not sent out for correction, but to ensure timely reviews of newly published works. The list of recipients designated by the publisher limits the number of copies to only what is required, making advance copies a form of print-on- demand (POD) publication. Pre-publication publicity proofs are normally gathered and bound in paper, but in the case of books with four-color printed illustrations, publicity proofs may be lacking illustrations or have them in black and white only. They may be marked or stamped on the cover \\"uncorrected proof\\", but the recipient is not expected to proofread them, merely to overlook any minor errors of typesetting. Galley proofs in electronic form are rarely used as advance reading copies due to the possibility of a recipient editing the proof and issuing it as their own. However, trusted colleagues are occasionally offered electronic advance reading copies, especially if the publisher wishes to quickly typeset a page or two of \\"advance praise\\" notices within the book itself.

Patriot cavalry commander Continental Army Colonel Henry Lee surprised Loyalist militia under Dr. John Pyle, who thought Lee was the British cavalry commander Banastre Tarleton sent to meet Pyle. Lee's men then opened fire, surprising and scattering Pyle's force, with Colonel Lee pursuing Tarleton in the direction of Hillsborough, NC, intending to capture or kill his command. Background British general the Earl Cornwallis had been unable to catch Nathanael Greene's army (in what historians now call the \\"Race to the Dan\\"), who strategically retreated using a screening feint column under Col. Otho Williams, to Dix's Ferry (present day Danville, VA) allowing Greene to cross the Dan River at Irwin's (Turbeville, VA) and Boyd's Ferry (South Boston, VA) and out of North Carolina. Cornwallis, who had burned his baggage train at Ramsour's Mill (Lincolnton, NC), in chasing Greene completely exhausted his men, who were also starving in wet freezing weather with little forage from locals. All the boats for crossing the Dan River were taken by Greene (Colonel Henry Lee in command of the rear guard cavalry was the last to cross approx. 2 hours before the British arrived) so that Cornwallis was stranded on the NC side of the river. Cornwallis made an exhaustive trip South, establishing a headquarters to regroup and recover at Hillsborough, North Carolina, a colonial outpost city, on February 21, also to rally Loyalists to his side. Dr. John Pyle (1723-1804) had moved to Chatham County in 1767. Noted for his loyalty to the King, he had assisted the Governor in the War of the Regulation, though he was not at the Battle of Alamance. When Cornwallis appealed for Loyalist volunteers, Pyle gathered between 300 and 400 men. He requested Cornwallis provide his men with an escort, and Banastre Tarleton with his cavalry and a small force of infantry, a total of about 450 men, marched to lead Pyle to safety. General Greene spent days in Virginia from the 15th to the 22nd, where he was able to resupply, feed his troops, medically recover his wounded and gain reinforcements. On February 17 he detached Colonel Henry Lee with his cavalry, and Colonel Andrew Pickens with Maryland infantry and South Carolina militia, to recross the Dan and monitor British activity. This force crossed the Dan on February 18 and set up a hidden camp along the road between Hillsborough and Haw River crossing points. From there Lee sent scouts to watch for British movements. Word came the next morning that Tarleton was moving toward the Haw with an estimated 400 men. Lee and Pickens followed behind Tarleton, who, they learned, had camped near the Haw. A planned attack was called off when scouts reported that Tarleton had again moved, after the militia companies he was expecting to meet did not show up. Pyle's force had delayed its movement (in violation of orders) to visit with family and friends before setting off. At noon on February 24, Lee and Pickens captured two British staff officers and learned through interrogation that Tarleton was only a few miles ahead. In the waning hours of the day, Lee's Legion, who wore short green jackets and plumed helmets, encountered two of Pyle's men, who mistook them for Tarleton's dragoons, who wore similar uniforms. Lee used this to his advantage and learned that Pyle's troops were nearby. Lee instructed Pickens' riflemen to flank Pyle's position, and then trotted into the camp in full salute. Lee exchanged customary civilities with Colonel Pyle and began shaking his hand when the sounds of battle commenced. Battle The most commonly accepted account of the battle, pieced together from reports from Lee and Captain Joseph Graham, indicates that Lee's deception was purely chance, and that he had originally intended to avoid the Loyalists, intending instead to encounter Tarleton's Dragoons, the more important objective. The sounds of battle apparently commenced when the militia at the rear of Lee's Legion, recognizing the strips of red cloth on the hats of Pyle's men as the badge of Loyalists, alerted Captain Eggleston, who was new to the South and was not familiar with local Whig and Tory badges. When he asked one of the Loyalists which side he was on, the man replied \\"King George\\", and Eggleston responded by striking him on the head with his sabre. Seeing this, Pickens' riflemen joined in the attack.Davis, p. 128 The cavalry line turned and also attacked the Loyalists. Pyle's men broke and ran, but many were either killed or wounded in the early exchanges. Many Loyalists, believing the attack to be a mistake, continued insisting they were on King George's side, to no avail. After 10 minutes, the remaining Loyalists had fled, and 93 Loyalists were known to be dead, certainly more were wounded and others were seen being carried off by friends.At least one Patriot POW was reported Killed with the Tories-see \\"Journal of the American Revolution According to local legend, John Pyle was badly wounded in the battle and crawled into a nearby pond where he concealed himself until he could be rescued. After recovering from his wounds, he surrendered to the local militia. Later they were pardoned because of Dr. Pyle's care for wounded patriots. \\"Pyle's Pond\\" by Benson Lossing, 1852 Aftermath Pickens and Lee never caught up with Tarleton, since Cornwallis ordered him to rejoin the main army on the night of February 24. Though pursued, Tarleton eventually got too close to the main British army for Pickens and Lee to attack safely. Additionally, Nathanael Greene's recovered army crossed the Dan River back into NC on February 22, proceeding for contact and action at Guilford Courthouse on March 15, 1781. Lee and Pickens broke off to screen and join the campaign, their task to demoralize and discourage Loyalist volunteers from adding to the diminishing British forces having been successful. There were reports of atrocities committed by Catawba Indians in a late-arriving company, with claims that men were butchered after asking for quarter. The British were quick to denounce the incident as a massacre. Cornwallis, in a letter to Lord George Germain, reported that most of Pyle's force were \\"inhumanly butchered, when begging for quarters, without making the least resistance.\\" Lee later noted that if he had wanted a massacre he would have chased down the remnants of Pyle's company. Rather, Lt. Col. Lee allowed those who wished to run away do so in the successful strategy of putting off the fantasy tales of the British Army of their superior cavalry, etc., and help put an end to recruiting efforts by the Loyalists in N. Carolina for the British, as described by Lee in his memoir, \\"Memoirs of the War in the Southern Department of the United States\\" and in 1969 republished by Arno Press, Inc., New York as \\"The American Revolution In The South.\\" Ch 27. The battle occurred a few weeks before the Battle of Guilford Courthouse and was a contributing factor in weakening British troop numbers and morale. As late as the 1850s, local residents could point out the location of the battle and the mass graves of those killed during the skirmish; at least one known mass grave has been recently relocated. The site is marked with periwinkle and cedar trees and at one time had a stone marker (placed in 1880), which has since been removed from the site; the marker's current location is unknown.

Despite having that office, he spent as much time as he could in Dublin and away from his parish. When Jonathan Swift was made dean of St. Patrick's Cathedral, Dublin, Smedley pinned derogatory verses on the cathedral door, denouncing Swift. At that point, the Tory party was still in power in England, but the Whig party was ascendant. In 1715, just after the first Jacobite rebellion, Smedley was chosen to preach in for the Protestants. His sermon was full of invective for the High church position, and he accused the high churchmen of weakening the Church of England for an overthrow by the Roman Catholic Church, which was always scheming to take control. In 1718, he again attacked high churchmen with A Rational and Historical Account of the Principles which Gave Birth to the Late Rebellion. This prompted Swift to respond from the pulpit to a sermon preached by \\"that scoundrel Smedley.\\" Smedley again accused the high church of being in the Pope's service, and he further sees the great hope of England with only the House of Hanover and the dissenters (i.e. the remnants of the Puritan movement and the churches arising from it). He was further spending as much time in London as he was able and lobbying to get further preferment in the church. He did this by publishing nine of his sermons in 1719, and in 1721, 1723, and 1730 he published collections of his verses (at each juncture a time when Smedley was seeking preferment). Richard Steele became one of Smedley's champions. He argued that Smedley had suffered persecution for his Whig views before 1714 (and the death of Queen Anne) and his tirelessness in the righteous causes of Protestantism. Smedley was given the deanery of Killala in western Ireland. He may not have spent much time at his new cathedral, and he presented himself as often as possible to the public as an anti-Swift, as the real \\"Dean Jonathan.\\" In 1724 he resigned the cathedral of Killala for the cathedral at Clogher, which put him in the thick of the political life of Dublin and gave him easy shipping for London. He apparently wished to exchange that cathedral for a position in England itself. He was Dean of Clogher from 1724 to 1727.\\"Clogher clergy and parishes : being an account of the clergy of the Church of Ireland in the Diocese of Clogher, from the earliest period, with historical notices of the several parishes, churches, etc\\" Leslie, J.B pp33/4: Fermanagh, R.H. Ritchie 1929 In 1728 Smedley was made one of the bad examples in Alexander Pope's The Dunciad. Pope has Smedley among the muck-divers in Book II of the poem, where Smedley dives into the sewage and filth of Fleet Ditch and, though presumed dead, reemerges some 34 lines later with a lengthy tale of his exploits beneath the mud. That year, Smedley attacked Swift again in Gulliveriana and also attempted to attack Pope. Swift replied with The Duke's Answer. During this time Smedley attempted to get subscriptions for a projected A Universal View of All the Eminent Writers on the Holy Scriptures, but this came to nought. Smedley was unable or unwilling to live within his income, and he mortgaged part of his deanery in Clogher to Benjamin Hoadley, then a rising figure in the political side of the Church. In 1729, Smedley resigned Clogher for the position of chaplain to Fort Madras in the British East India Company. He died en route on 30 March 1729 and was buried at sea. It later emerged that he had even sold his position of chaplain for ¬£500 to someone in Madras. Pope left Smedley in a position of infamy in the Dunciad B, and Swift, with Thomas Sheridan, attacked Smedley after his death in The Intelligencer #20 with \\"Dean Smedley Gone to Seek His Fortune\\", where he says that the man was \\"of Dullness, Pride, Conceit, a medley.\\" References * Seccombe, Thomas and Toby Barnard. \\"Jonathan Smedley\\".

Retrieved December 18, 2008.. Adequate remedy at law refers to the sufficient compensation for the loss or damages caused by the defendant with a proper monetary award. The court must grant the adequacy of remedy that will lead to a \\"meaningful hearing\\". Whether legal damages or equitable relief are requested depends largely on,whether or not the remedy can be valued. Both two elements, compensation and the meaningfulness of hearing, provide a proper way to have an adequate remedy. The word \\"meaningfulness\\" of hearing in the law process is the assumption that the defendant compensated must be meaningful for the injured party where the defendant made a fully covered compensation for all the losses. Hence, the hearing in which cannot give any right amount of compensation award or settlement is not \\"meaningful\\", and the unavailability of the compensation will lead to an inadequate remedy. The adequate remedy at law is the legal remedies by meaning it is satisfactory compensation by way of monetary damages without granting equitable remedies. As an operation of law, an attorney often must present to the court whether there is an adequate remedy. This would be a basic principle of equity.William L. Clark, Jr., Handbook Of The Law Of Contracts, found at Chest of Books.com website. Retrieved December 18, 2008. When a monetary award is not an adequate or appropriate remedy, equity can order a \\"specific performance\\", an order of the court requiring a party to perform the obligations that he or she undertook to perform under the contract. The \\"specific performance\\" exists when there is an exchange under a contract that can not be found easily elsewhere or at all, such as antiques, parcels of land. Damages are often bifurcated or determined in a separate trial or as a part in parcel of different determination from whether a certain tort or contract has occurred. History The phrase \\"Adequate Remedies\\" first appeared in the Judiciary Act of 1789. It was elaborated that \\"adequate remedy\\" is denied that relief of the equity must be owned by the law. Although there is a contradiction in the 1938 of Federal Rules of Civil Procedures, that the equity of law must include \\"adequate remedy\\" in rule 57, Declaratory Judgements. On this judgements, it refers that although there is a monetary damage to a case a court may also issue a declaratory of the judgement. In the early United States legal history, \\"Adequate Remedies\\" is associated with the distinction between courts of law and equity. \\"Adequate Remedies\\" refers to the legal remedy, and equitable remedies that apply to the administrative or state court remedies. The court was unable to grant any equitable remedies such as specific performance where there is a plain legal remedy such as monetary damages. \\"Adequate Remedies\\" continues to appear in the federal case between 1938 to 1946. Purpose of Legal Remedy The remedy is defined as the remedy at law where the judicial remedy or legal remedy takes place in the court. It is the manner on which side is correct that is admitted wrongly by society. Therefore, it is crucial to protect the individual's right and categorised cases to ensure an adequate remedy. There are two main categories of remedies which are legal remedy and equitable remedy. The example for the classification of legal remedies is damage, one of the most found types of damages is the compensatory damages where it compensates directly to the injured party or the non-breaching party for the value of the loss. Nonetheless, it is essential to value or compensate the right amount to the injured party equivalent to the loss of their suffering. The second category is an equitable remedy where it exists for the specific performance, injunction and restitution. Legal Remedy Legal remedies in law are referring to a judicial relief or judicial remedy or damages. The damages are the compensation that is paid by the breaching party to the non-breaching party. Mainly, the legal remedy is presented in the civil law of the jurisdiction that supports rights, giving a penalty and court order. The legal remedy is effective when the suffering party is economically more benefit if there exists a monetary damage or compensation consequence to perform although the objective of these remedies is not to punish the defendant or the breaching party. \\"Adequate Remedy\\" is legal remedies that suffice the defendant to pay the loss of the victim. Equitable Remedy This equitable remedy is a presence when the courts ask the defendant or the suffering party to do something, such as breaching a contract or \\"injunctive relief. The equitable remedy can be a presence that if the defendant does not want any monetary damages for the case that they suffer; instead, they want equity that afford the relief. As a result, the breaching party should follow the court orders such as, stop doing something that they have been warned or exchange to such as actual property. =Specific Performance= The first type of equitable remedy is specific performance, it refers to the remedy that is claimed by the creditor to the debtor. The creditor can claim specific performance and sue the debtor when the debtor is breaking the affirmative decision. Such as the creditor sues the delivery of the unique personal land and property or unique car and paintings. There exist some restrictions to this type of equitable remedy where it is a limited remedy that only exists if the breaching of a contract must be unique items. =Injunction= Secondly, injunction, this is a legal action of the court order to stop and forbidding someone from doing something illegal activities such as breaching a contract. The example of injunctions are waste, trespass to land, injury to industrial property and misuse of confidential of the information. =Restitution= This is a remedy that bringing back to the parties to the place where before the deal was created. This type of equitable remedy is a contradiction with monetary damages or compensation. Restitution defined as the return of the restoration of a condition or contract. For instance, returning a property to the non-breaching party, which is was taken by the defendant. An Individual who breaks an agreement ought not to endure a discipline, and the non- breaching party should not unlawfully enrich. Type of Damages Damages refer to the monetary reward or the compensation to make up of the damages caused by the defendant. There are six classifications of damages which are compensatory, consequential, punitive, incidental, nominal and liquidated damages. The objectives to fulfil the remedies is to make the plaintiff or suffering party not to suffer, the law allows several damages or compensation to cover the losses by the injured party. Compensatory Damages Compensatory damages are compensated directly to the injured party when the defendant is proven to refuse with the affirmative action. This type of damage is simple to calculate where it would cost as much as the loss of the injured party and in return giving back the exact service. Calculating for the compensation or the money of the loss for the non-breaching party is easy. Compensatory damages is a fixed amount of compensation. It can be calculated from the loss of the injured party by giving evidence of how much money is lost. Consequential Damages Consequential damages are the special damage where the defendant causes to lose profit money indirectly. However, this is difficult to examined and trace the violation to the breaching party. The most common cause for this damage is the breaching of a contract that leads to profit lost. Consequential Damages hence is the end result of the contract breaching that leads to some losses and indirect damages to the plaintiff. Punitive Damages Punitive damages are different from the compensatory damages where the non-breaching party does not want to have compensation that is caused by the defendant. The injured party tends to punish the defendant in a different way in a similar charge. This damages can only exist only in the non-contract action. The punitive damages commonly occurred in the civil action in which there does not exist a criminal sanction. The jury or judge can make a decision to this damages that will impact more to a richer person that may pay more to encounter punitive damage since this damages are not hooked by the law. Incidental Damages Incidental damages occur when covering the cost of someone from the breaching contract. Such as breaking the hiring contract, the company should cover the compensation of the employee as the cost to find another job. These damages are an addition to compensatory damages Additionally, this happens not by intention but by chance where it is incidental and unpredictable of consequences. Incidental damages is a direct result that suffers by one party that breach the contract. Nominal Damages In the nominal damages, the non-breaching party cannot give the evidence of loss but suffering from the injury. There is a lack of proof that the non-breaching is suffering from loss. One of the common examples of this damages is the personal injury claim, the non-breaching party or the plaintiff should provide the prove that and evidence of the physical injury suffered. Liquidated Damages Damages are sometimes hard to assess; hence the non- breaching party determine the amount to pay for the breach. The example of this damage is when the plaintiff has a contract in purchasing defendant's house under their agreement, and the defendant must pay back the deposit money as liquidated damages since there exists a breach of a contract by the defendant. Then, the plaintiff sued the defendant, but the defendant also argues that there was an accident that caused the death of her husband. Example of Adequate Remedy=Case 1 The case of the Adequate Remedy goes something like this. James has a house which he values at $30,000. John, who is attracted to buying the house, gives the value to it at $60,000 and offers to James $50,000. After bargaining several times, the price still stays at this price. James and John sign a contract that states that John can take over the ownership of the house in 30 days. Hence the sale price of the house is at $50,000 and leave James $20,000 of surplus and John $10,000 of surplus. One week after signing the contract, Jack came to James and offered to buy the house at a higher price at $80,000. James then breaches his contract with John. John then files a lawsuit and sues James for violating the agreement, and he requested James to compensate for his loss. John is expecting the monetary damages where John wants to have an adequate remedy in the court. If the Adequate remedy by the judge is under monetary damage, Jack ends up taking the ownership of the house, and James is forced to value and pay for John losses which is $10,000 for his surplus losses and essential restitution. Case 2 A neighbour building on a landowner's parcel would have little or no value that can be paid because land is unique, and an inadequate value could be ascertained; contrast this, for instance, with the neighbour borrowing the landowner's car and being 100% at fault for an accident. In the latter case, the valuation of the car plus other consequentially- caused damages can be reasonably valuated. Therefore, as a general rule, where the fair market value can readily be assessed, with certain carved exceptions, the remedy at law is damages (or money). Whereas, the \\"inadequacy\\" of a remedy at law leads a lawyer usually to seek equitable relief from the court.

St James Gaels GAA Club was formed in July 1994 as the result of the amalgamation of An Caisle√°n and Guinness GAA Clubs. Both of these clubs had been in existence for many years but were struggling due to the increasing age profile within their respective base areas. Rather than allow two clubs to go out of existence both sets of club officers agreed, following negotiation, to pool resources with a view to forming one club serving Walkinstown and surrounding areas.  History  An Caisle√°n's roots can be traced back to a couple of weeks' after Dublin's victory over Derry in the 1958 All-Ireland Senior Football Championship final. A group of church stewards in Walkinstown Church decided, in the aftermath of Dublin's success, that the newly constituted parish needed its own identity and that a parish GAA Club was an important part in promoting that identity. With the blessing of the parish clergy they formed CLG Naomh Gear√≥id (St Gerard's) and went on to become a powerful force in the local community. The people who set up Naomh Gear√≥id purchased a site for a club premises and pitch. That site was situated in what is now the Robinhood Industrial Estate on the Long Mile Road (where Heiton/Buckley's Builders Providers is now) however for various reasons, mainly financial, they were forced to resell the property to pay off their debts. In 1966 the club, who wished to play their games within the parish boundaries, formed an alliance with the Christian Brothers in Drimnagh Castle CBS schools where they were given use of the school pitches and dressing rooms. As part of this alliance the club members agreed to change their name to An Caisle√°n and became the club for Brothers, pupils and past pupils of the school, almost all of whom lived in Walkinstown parish. During its twenty-eight years of existence An Caisle√°n won a number of leagues and championships at various grades. This included winning the Intermediate football league in 1987 and being runners-up in the Dublin Intermediate Football Championship in the same year. Another highlight was the junior hurlers reaching the Dublin Junior Hurling Championship final in 1979. Guinness GAA Club's history goes back much further than that of An Caisle√°n. The first club to represent and win in an All-Ireland (1891) for Dublin was a team called Young Irelands. Young Irelands team and officials were all labourers in Guinness's Brewery and in the 1890s they won several All Ireland titles at a time when club champions represented their counties in All Ireland championships. Young Irelands went out of existence in the early years of the twentieth century and were replaced in the brewery by a club called Phoenix GFC. This club had limited success during their lifetime before they in turn were replaced in the mid-forties by Guinness Hurling and Football Club who based themselves in the Iveagh Grounds. Guinness GAA Club, whose membership was confined to families and employees of the brewery and its associated companies, ran into difficulties as a result of the rationalising of the brewery operation during the economic downturn in the late 1980s and early 1990s. This rationalisation drastically reduced the intake of staff members of playing age and forced those running the club to consider winding up their operation or merging with another club.

Its top notes are a mixture of fruit and spices, with mandarin orange,Jan Moran lists \\"hesperides\\" instead. plum, clove, coriander and pepper, as well as bay leaf. Its floral middle notes consist predominantly jasmine, rose and Lily of the Valley, in addition to carnation, cinnamon, peach and orris root. It is underlined by the sweet woody base note containing sandalwood, cedarwood, myrrh, opopanax, labdanum, benzoin and castoreum, in addition to amber, incense, musk, patchouli, tolu and vetiver. Naming and theme Opium caused a stir with its controversial name and brought accusations that brand designer Yves Saint Laurent was condoning drug use. In the United States, a group of Chinese Americans demanded a change of the name and a public apology from Saint Laurent for \\"his insensitivity to Chinese history and Chinese American concerns.\\" They formed a committee called the American Coalition Against Opium and Drug Abuse, which expressed outrage at the choice of a name representing \\"a menace that destroyed many lives in China.\\" But such controversies rather helped the perfume to be well- publicized, which soon became a best-selling scent. For its launch party in 1977, a tall ship Peking was rented from the South Street Seaport Museum in New York's East Harbor, and writer Truman Capote sat at the helm of the ship at the party. The ship was draped with banners of gold, red, and purple, and the Oriental theme was displayed with a bronze statue of the Buddha, decorated with white cattleya orchids. YSL carried the Oriental theme into its packaging design as well--the red plastic container holding the perfume's glass vial, designed by Pierre Dinand, was inspired by , the small Japanese lacquered cases that were worn under kimonos and held perfumes, herbs and medicines. Opium, Lilac Perfume Oil and White Musk from The Body Shop, Juniper Breeze from Bath & Body Works and Royal Secret formerly Germaine Monteil were among the perfumes tested in 2003 in a study of the relationship of scents to memory. Ad campaign controversy A poster advertising campaign for the perfume caused another controversy in October and November 2000. It featured the model Sophie Dahl lying on her back wearing only a pair of stiletto heels, seemingly in the throes of ecstasy, with her legs spread apart as she covers one of her nipples with her hand.Opium advertisement, Yves Saint Laurent, at The Sophie Dahl Gallery This ad campaign, photographed by Steven Meisel, was widely seen in print ads and posters in bus shelters in many countries. It won an award in Spain but generated an uproar in other places, particularly in the United Kingdom. The British Advertising Standards Authority received more than 700 complaints from the public, and ordered the posters to be withdrawn on the grounds that they were too sexually suggestive, degrading to women, and likely to cause \\"serious or widespread offence\\".'Offensive' Opium posters to be removed, The Guardian - December 19, 2000 American journalist Susan Faludi argued that certain perfume ad campaigns pushed \\"idealization of weak yielding women\\" to the extreme, citing the Opium advertisement as a primary example. Opium pour Homme YSL launched the male complement Opium pour Homme in 1995, created by Jacques Cavallier of Firmenich. Its main note is set by vanilla, with black currant, galangal, star anise, ginger and pepper, fusing with basic notes of cedar and Tolu balsam. Its flask was designed by J√©r√¥me Failliant-Dumas.

Born in St Albans to Australian parents, Kerr returned with his family to Australia after the completion of World War I. He received degrees in physics at the University of Melbourne and an MA in astronomy from Harvard University (1951). In 1940, Frank had joined the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) radiophysics laboratory in Sydney, Australia under the mentorship of Joseph Lade Pawsey. He pioneered the use of the magnetron, and also studied superrefraction. In Australia in late 1951, Kerr used a specially built 36-foot transit telescope, the largest dish of its kind in Australia, and started mapping the Magellanic Clouds, discovering considerable amounts of neutral hydrogen and an extended envelope around both clouds. From 1954 to 1955, Kerr was a member of the team that determined the rotation of the Magellanic Clouds and their masses. Kerr coined the term \\"galactic warp\\" to refer to the distorting effect of the Magellanic Clouds' gravity on the shape of our own galaxy. Over the years he worked with various astronomers, including Colin Gum and Gart Westerhout. From 1966 to 1979, he was a visiting, then full, professor of astronomy at the University of Maryland, College Park. Kerr was the Director of the Astronomy Program during the mid-1970s. From 1978-1985, Kerr then acted as the Provost of the Mathematical and Physical Sciences and Engineering Division at the University of Maryland. He died of cancer at Silver Spring, Maryland.

The St. Louis Cardinals defeated the heavily favored New York Mets in seven games to advance to the 2006 World Series against the Detroit Tigers. The Cardinals and the Mets took the series to the limit, reaching the 9th inning of Game 7 tied at 1‚Äì1. The Cardinals took the lead with Yadier Molina's two-run home run off Mets reliever Aaron Heilman in the 9th to put his team ahead, 3‚Äì1. Adam Wainwright would then hold the Mets scoreless in the bottom of the 9th to give St. Louis their second pennant in three years and 17th in club history, placing them one behind the New York/San Francisco Giants and the Brooklyn/Los Angeles Dodgers for most in NL modern history (since 1903). The Cardinals were making their third consecutive appearance in the NLCS; manager Tony La Russa, who led St. Louis to the 2004 pennant and previously won AL titles with the Oakland Athletics from 1988‚Äì90, became the first manager in history to win multiple pennants in both leagues. The Mets, handicapped after season-ending injuries to Pedro Mart√≠nez and Orlando Hern√°ndez, qualified for postseason play for the first time since 2000. They defeated the Los Angeles Dodgers three games to none in the NL Division Series, while the Cardinals defeated the San Diego Padres three games to one.

The game's only runs came on a two-run homer by Carlos Beltr√°n off losing pitcher Jeff Weaver in the sixth following a two-out single by Paul Lo Duca. Glavine was aided by stellar defense, as the Mets turned two double plays. In the third inning, with runners on first and second, third baseman David Wright caught a line drive off the bat of David Eckstein and threw to second to double up Yadier Molina. In the following inning, Juan Encarnaci√≥n flied out to shallow center to Beltr√°n, who threw to first on the run to double up Albert Pujols, who went 0-for-3 with a walk. Left fielder Endy Ch√°vez also made an excellent diving play on a flare hit by Ronnie Belliard. He replaced Cliff Floyd, who left in the second inning when he reaggravated his injured Achilles tendon. Following the game, Albert Pujols was controversially critical of Glavine's performance, saying that the Cards would have dominated him if they were on their \\"A\\" game. His exact words were: > \\"He wasn't good. He wasn't good at all ... I think we hit the ball hard, we > didn't get some breaks. I say he wasn't good at all. We just didn't get some > opportunities and that's it.... [He did the] same thing that he always does. > Throw a changeup, fastball and that was > it.\\"https://articles.latimes.com/2006/oct/14/sports/sp-nlnotes14 Pujols' comments drew criticism from fans, talk-show hosts, broadcasters, and even his own manager. Tony La Russa, while maintaining that Pujols made the remarks in the heat of the moment, said \\"It's not a good statement. Glavine deserves credit.\\" https://sports.yahoo.com/news/pujols-comments-draw- attention-004800985--mlb.html Tom Glavine, when asked, merely said that everyone is entitled to their own opinion. His teammate Billy Wagner, on the other hand, said: > \\"I know if Albert would have said that about me, I wouldn't have been as > veteraned, as seasoned about it ... I probably would have said something > back. That's me. Tom is classy all the way ... Tom's done so much. Tom > doesn't have to stoop to tell people how good he is ... His numbers speak > for themselves. With 290 wins for somebody that has been in the league as > long as he has is pretty self-explanatory ...Tommy's stature is much bigger > than Pujols'.

In the first inning, Carlos Delgado hit a three-run home run off the Cardinals' ace Chris Carpenter. Yadier Molina then drove in two runs with a bases-loaded double in the second inning off of John Maine. In the bottom of the second, Endy Chavez hit a leadoff double, moved to third on a groundout and scored on Jos√© Reyes's, but Jim Edmonds's home run after a walk tied the game in the third. Delgado's home run in the fifth put the Mets back on top 5‚Äì4. Next inning, Cardinals reliever Josh Hancock walked Reyes, who scored on Paul Lo Duca's double, but Scott Spiezio, who started the game at third base in place of an injured Scott Rolen, had two hits and three RBIs, including a two-run triple on an 0‚Äì2 pitch in the seventh inning to tie the game at six off of Guillermo Mota. Lefty closer Billy Wagner came into the game in the top of the ninth inning. Left fielder Chris Duncan, a lefty hitter, was due to lead off, so, Duncan was pulled in favor of So Taguchi, a right-hitting outfielder who was a better defensive option than Duncan. Taguchi homered on the ninth pitch of the at-bat to put the Cardinals ahead, 7‚Äì6. Albert Pujols doubled and moved to third on a groundout before Spiezio's RBI double and Juan Encarnaci√≥n's single extended the Cardinals' lead to 9‚Äì6. Tyler Johnson and Adam Wainwright retired the Mets in order in the bottom of the ninth as the Cardinals' win tied the series 1‚Äì1. Game 3 Saturday, October 14, 2006 at Busch Stadium (III) in St. Louis, Missouri Back in St. Louis for the next three games, St. Louis starter Jeff Suppan pitched eight innings as the Cardinals defeated the Mets, 5‚Äì0. Scott Spiezio hit a two-run triple (his second two-run triple in as many games) in the bottom of the first inning to put the Cardinals ahead, 2‚Äì0. The Cardinals loaded the bases on two walks afterward, but Mets starter Steve Trachsel struck out Yadier Molina looking to end the inning. Next inning, Suppan's leadoff home run made it 3‚Äì0, who then loaded the bases on two walks and a line drive off the bat of Preston Wilson that hit Trachsel, who left with a bruised thigh. Mets reliever Darren Oliver threw a wild pitch to Jim Edmonds that let David Eckstein score before Edmonds's RBI groundout plated the last run of the game. Oliver then pitched six shutout innings. After the game, the Mets had not scored in 12 consecutive innings, making it 14 before scoring in the third inning of Game 4. Game 4 Sunday, October 15, 2006 at Busch Stadium (III) in St. Louis, Missouri Game 4 was a pivotal game for the Mets, who were faced with a two-games-to-one deficit. They sent √ìliver P√©rez, a young lefty picked up at the trade deadline from the Pittsburgh Pirates, to face the Cardinals' own young starter, Anthony Reyes. In a game that would see an NLCS-record-tying seven home runs, the Cardinals grabbed an early lead in the bottom of the second on a Yadier Molina single. It seemed to be a repeat of the night before, but in the top of the third the Mets hit two home runs, one being Carlos Beltr√°n's second of the series and sixth against the Cardinals in NLCS play, and another representing David Wright's first hit of the series and first homer of the playoffs. The lead was short-lived, as Scott Spiezio walked with one out, then scored on Juan Encarnaci√≥n's two-out triple to tie the game. The game would stay tied until the top of the fifth inning, when Paul Lo Duca reached on an error by Cardinals second baseman Ronnie Belliard, Beltr√°n managed a walk, and Carlos Delgado scored an opposite-field three-run homer, his third of the series, to make it 5‚Äì2 Mets and knock starter Brad Thompson out of the game. David Eckstein pulled the Cards back in the bottom of the fifth with a leadoff homer, but, in the top of the sixth, the Mets extended the lead. Jos√© Reyes and Paul Lo Duca hit back- to-back singles off of Josh Hancock, and Beltr√°n walked to load the bases. Delgado then hit a ground-rule double to drive in two runs, and then Wright walked. Tyler Johnson relieved Hancock and Shawn Green singled to drive in one run and Jos√© Valent√≠n, who, at that point, was only 3-for-20 in the playoffs, hit a bases-clearing double down the left field line to make it 11‚Äì3. The Cardinals got home runs from Edmonds and Molina to make it an 11‚Äì5 game, but Mets manager Willie Randolph then pulled starter P√©rez and bought in submarine pitcher Chad Bradford to try and limit the damage. Beltr√°n would tie the NLCS record of seven home runs with another in the seventh off of Braden Looper en route to a final score of 12‚Äì5. Beltr√°n also tied Babe Ruth for the all-time postseason record of seven home runs against the Cardinals, having hit four against them in the 2004 National League Championship Series while playing for the Houston Astros. Game 5 Tuesday, October 17, 2006 at Busch Stadium (III) in St. Louis, Missouri After Game 5 was pushed back a day by rain, giving their starter now four days' normal rest instead of three days' short rest, the Mets sought a 3‚Äì2 lead in the NLCS. However, pitcher Tom Glavine could not stifle the Cardinals' offense. After the Mets jumped out to a 2‚Äì0 lead on Jose Valentin's double off of Jeff Weaver, the next half-inning Albert Pujols struck for his first home run and RBI of the series to cut the Mets' lead in half. Glavine then walked Scott Rolen and allowed a single to Jim Edmonds before Ronnie Belliard tied the game with a single to left. David Eckstein singled to lead off the fifth and scored on Preston Wilson double to put the Cardinals up 3‚Äì2. St. Louis padded their lead in the sixth through a pinch-hit home run by rookie Chris Duncan off of Pedro Feliciano that made the final score 4‚Äì2, Cardinals. The win moved the Cardinals within one of their second National League pennant in three years. Game 6 Wednesday, October 18, 2006 at Shea Stadium in Queens, New York Facing elimination, the Mets sent John Maine to start Game 6\\\\. He allowed no runs in innings, earning the win for the Mets. Jos√© Reyes hit a leadoff home run in the bottom of the first, giving the Mets a lead that would never be relinquished. Reyes became the first Met to lead off with a home run in the first inning of a postseason game since former outfielder Lenny Dykstra in Game 3 of the 1986 World Series against the Boston Red Sox. The Cardinals stranded several runners against Maine. In the top of the first inning, with runners on second and third and one out, Maine struck out Jim Edmonds. After Maine hit Juan Encarnaci√≥n with a pitch to load the bases, Scott Rolen flew out. In the top of the third, with a runner on second and nobody out, Maine struck out Scott Spiezio and intentionally walked Albert Pujols. Edmonds then flew out and Maine struck out Encarnaci√≥n to finish the job. Shawn Green hit an RBI single in the fourth off of starter Chris Carpenter and Paul Lo Duca added two more with an RBI hit in the seventh off of Braden Looper. Billy Wagner came on in the ninth and allowed a leadoff single to Juan Encarnaci√≥n and subsequent double to Scott Rolen. After retiring the next two batters, Wagner gave up a two-RBI double to So Taguchi before retiring David Eckstein to end the game. Game 7 Endy Ch√°vez plaque Thursday, October 19, 2006 at Shea Stadium in Queens, New York In the decisive Game 7, the Mets sent Game 4 winner √ìliver P√©rez to the mound against Jeff Suppan. The Mets jumped out to an early 1‚Äì0 lead when David Wright drove in Carlos Beltr√°n in the first with a bloop single into right field. The Cardinals tied the game in the second when Ronnie Belliard hit into a squeeze play that scored Jim Edmonds from third. In the fifth, with runners on first and second and two gone, Albert Pujols came up to the plate. Even with Chad Bradford warming up in the bullpen, Willie Randolph decided to stay with P√©rez. He got Pujols to pop out. P√©rez ran into some more trouble in the sixth with a runner on and one out, when Scott Rolen hit a long fly ball to left field to create one of the greatest defensive plays in postseason history. The ball cleared the fence, but Endy Ch√°vez amazingly brought it back by snow-coning the ball, jumping from the edge of the warning track to snag what looked to be an easy home run. He then threw the ball to first base quickly to double off Jim Edmonds, who had rounded second on his way to third, to end the inning. He received two curtain calls from the Shea crowd. With the bases loaded and one out in the bottom of the sixth, Jos√© Valent√≠n and Ch√°vez failed to get the go-ahead run in. With the score 1‚Äì1 in the top of the ninth, Yadier Molina, with a man on-base, hit a deep fly off Aaron Heilman in the same general direction as the one Rolen hit in the sixth. This ball was hit too high for Ch√°vez to catch, and it gave the Cardinals a 3‚Äì1 lead, with only three outs in the bottom of the ninth separating them from a pennant. However, the Mets would not go quietly. Rookie closer Adam Wainwright yielded singles to Valent√≠n and Ch√°vez to lead off the ninth. After getting a strikeout and a fly-out, Wainwright walked Paul Lo Duca to bring up Carlos Beltr√°n with the bases loaded. Down 0‚Äì2 to the rookie Wainwright, Beltr√°n looked at a curveball on the outside corner at the knees for a called strike three to end the series. This was the last playoff game played in Shea Stadium and the last postseason appearance for the Mets until 2015, six years after Citi Field opened. It is also the second time that a visiting team won a postseason series at Shea (the other being the Yankees' victory over the Mets in the 2000 World Series). Composite box 2006 NLCS (4‚Äì3): St. Louis Cardinals over New York Mets Aftermath The Cardinals would win the World Series by defeating the heavily favored Detroit Tigers. With 83 wins, the Cardinals set a record for the worst regular season win-loss total for any championship team. They would win another World Series in 2011 and make another World Series appearance in 2013 (where they lost to the Boston Red Sox). Manager Tony La Russa retired after the 2011 season, going out a champion. As for the Mets, many commentators and fans had predicted that 2006 would be the beginning of a dynasty. They had dominated the National League that season, winning 97 games when no one else won more than 88, and they had a deep and young core, with Beltran, Wright, and Reyes being under 30 (the latter two being under 25). Supporting those three were Hall of Fame caliber players such as Carlos Delgado, Tom Glavine, Pedro Mart√≠nez, and Billy Wagner. Nonetheless, 2006 stands as the only major achievement for this group. They suffered a historic collapse at the end of the 2007 season, losing 12 of their final 17 games to blow a 7-game division lead and miss the postseason by one game. After a smaller late-season collapse the next season, they again missed the postseason by one game. They ultimately would not return to the postseason until 2015. Manager Willie Randolph was fired in the middle of the 2008 season, Delgado played his last game in 2009, General Manager Omar Minaya was fired after 2010 (In 2017, he was brought back as a Special Assistant to then-General Manager Sandy Alderson), Beltran was dealt away at the 2011 trade deadline, and Reyes left via free agency that offseason. Reyes would eventually return to the Mets in 2016; he, along with David Wright, would leave the Mets after the 2018 season - Reyes's contract was not renewed, and Wright retired as a result of spinal stenosis.

The wild card Detroit Tigers swept the West Division champion Oakland Athletics 4 games to none to advance to the 2006 World Series, and became the fourth AL team to win 10 pennants, joining the New York Yankees (39), the Athletics (15), and the Boston Red Sox (11). Magglio Ord√≥√±ez's game-winning walk-off home run in the bottom of the 9th inning of Game 4 sealed the pennant for the Tigers. This ALCS marked the 5th different AL pennant winner in as many years (following 2005 with the White Sox, 2004 with the Red Sox, 2003 with the Yankees, and 2002 with the Angels). The Athletics defeated the Minnesota Twins 3 games to none in the AL Division Series, and the Tigers defeated the Yankees 3 games to 1. The Tigers faced the National League champions St. Louis Cardinals in the World Series, but lost in five games. The Athletics had home-field advantage (despite the Tigers having a better regular season record) as the wild card team defers home field advantage in the LCS regardless of regular season record. The Athletics were seeking their first AL pennant since 1990, while the Tigers captured the league title for the first time since their win in the 1984 World Series. The series was a rematch of the 1972 American League Championship Series (then a best-of-five series), in which Oakland defeated Detroit in 5 games. Detroit manager Jim Leyland, who led the Florida Marlins to the 1997 World Series title, became the seventh manager in history to win pennants in both leagues. It was the second consecutive ALCS without the Yankees and Red Sox. Summary=Oakland Athletics vs. Detroit Tigers=Game summaries=Game 1 Rally sticks given to fans for Game 1 in Oakland. Tuesday, October 10, 2006 at McAfee Coliseum in Oakland, California Oakland was 0-for-13 with runners in scoring position, while Detroit turned four double plays (both are LCS records). Tigers first baseman Sean Casey left the game in the bottom of the sixth inning due to an apparent leg injury. Brandon Inge homered with two outs in the third off Barry Zito, who allowed a double and two walks to load the bases before Magglio Ord√≥√±ez's single scored another run. Next inning, Iv√°n Rodr√≠guez hit a leadoff home run off Zito, who then walked Craig Monroe. Marcus Thames then hit into a forceout, advancing to second on D'Angelo Jim√©nez's error and scoring on Inge's double. Inge moved to third on Curtis Granderson's groundout, then scored on Pl√°cido Polanco's single. Oakland avoided a shutout when Milton Bradley doubled to lead off the eighth off Joel Zumaya, moved to third on Frank Thomas's groundout, and scored on Jay Payton's groundout. Game 2 Wednesday, October 11, 2006 at McAfee Coliseum in Oakland, California Oakland struck first in Game 2 when Mark Kotsay doubled in the first with one out off Justin Verlander, moved to third on a wild pitch, and scored on Milton Bradley's single, but Detroit tied it when Carlos Guill√©n doubled to lead off the second off Esteban Loaiza, moved to third on a groundout, and scored on Craig Monroe's sacrifice fly. In the third, Kotsay doubled with two outs off Verlander before Bradley homered to put Oakland up 3-1. In the fourth, Detroit loaded the bases on two singles and a walk with one out off Loaiza before Monroe's single scored a run, Alexis Gomez's 2-run single gave Detroit the lead, and Brandon Inge's sacrifice fly put the Tigers up 5-3. In the sixth, Monroe doubled off Loaiza with two outs before Gomez homered to put Detroit up 7-3. Eric Chavez's leadoff home run off Verlander in the bottom of the inning cut the lead to 7-4. Next inning, Bradley homered with two outs off Wilfredo Ledezma to make it 7-5 Detroit, but the Tigers got that run back in the ninth on Granderson's leadoff home run off Huston Street. In the bottom of the inning, Oakland got three straight two-out singles off Todd Jones to load the bases, but Frank Thomas flew out to center to end the game. Since the ALCS has been increased to a seven-game series, no team has come back to win the series after losing the first two games at home. Game 3 Friday, October 13, 2006 at Comerica Park in Detroit, Michigan Oakland infielder Mark Kiger, who was called up from the minors for the ALCS following an injury to Mark Ellis, entered the game in the eighth inning as a defensive replacement for second baseman D'Angelo Jim√©nez, thereby becoming the first player in modern baseball history to make his major-league debut in a postseason game. Kenny Rogers also continued to dominate, not allowing the A's to score once for his second victory in the postseason. Curtis Granderson walked to lead off the first off Rich Harden, moved to third on Craig Monroe's single, and scored on Pl√°cido Polanco's single. Magglio Ord√≥√±ez's sacrifice fly made it 2-0 Tigers. Monroe's leadoff home run in the fifth off Harden made it 3-0. Todd Jones picked up his second save with a 1-2-3 ninth. Game 4 Saturday, October 14, 2006 at Comerica Park in Detroit, Michigan In Game 4, Mark Kotsay walked with one out in the first off Jeremy Bonderman, then scored on Milton Bradley's double. One out later, Bradley scored on Eric Chavez's double to put Oakland up 2-0. Jay Payton homered in the fourth to make it 3‚Äì0. In the fifth, however, Brandon Inge singled off Dan Haren, moving to second on an error. After moving to third on a groundout, Inge scored on a double by Curtis Granderson, who then scored on Craig Monroe's double. Magglio Ord√≥√±ez homered in the sixth to tie the game at three. In the bottom of the ninth, Huston Street got two outs, then allowed back-to-back singles to Polanco and Monroe before Ord√≥√±ez launched a three-run walk-off home run to win the game and advance the Tigers to the 2006 World Series. Ord√≥√±ez's blast was the first pennant-winning home run since Aaron Boone's in Game 7 of the 2003 ALCS and came on the 30th Anniversary of Chris Chambliss' pennant-winning walk-off in Game 5 of the 1976 ALCS.

At the end of each of the three contests, the Cooley Sweepstakes Trophy is awarded. To get to the all-state speech tournament, one must first proceed from the district and state tournaments. At district for speech, there is one judge (except for One Act Play, which has 3 judges) who issues ratings and every team or individual who receives a \\"I\\" goes on. At State (there are four \\"state\\" tournaments) there are three judges, and two out of three must not only give a \\"I\\" rating, but also give a recommendation. Tournaments The State Debate Tournament is typically held the first weekend of January each year. Schools are only allowed to enter a certain number of debaters in each category, aimed at getting the best debaters from Iowa to the tournament. Events include Student Congress and Lincoln-Douglas Debate, as well as others. The IHSSA uses the same rules and resolutions as the National Forensic League when hosting these events. District tournaments are held for both large group and individual events separately. State tournaments are also held separately for large group and individual events. There are four state tournaments in Iowa. The All-State Festival is actually not a tournament because there are no judges or superior tournaments to compete for. Instead, the best in each category are showcased at two separate events. Critics give comments instead of ratings given by judges. Large group events *One act play.

The oxbow lake is in the upper left. Five days later, a levee breach resulted in the refuge closing after being nearly totally inundated. The Fort Calhoun Nuclear Generating Station is in the foreground. DeSoto National Wildlife Refuge, created in 1958, is located along the banks of the Missouri River in the U.S. states of Iowa and Nebraska. The refuge (46% in Iowa, 54% in Nebraska) preserves an area that would have been otherwise lost to cultivation. In 1960, an Army Corps of Engineers channelization project on the Missouri River moved the main river channel in the area to the west. The former river channel became DeSoto Lake, a seven-mile long oxbow lake. As a result, part of the Nebraska portion of the refuge lies on the east side of the Missouri River. For over 20 years after construction, the lake was used for recreational boating, with half of the lake designated for watersports and the other half a no-wake zone for wildlife habitat and fishing. The lake was so popular that access was limited by the park's rangers to keep the boat traffic down on the lake on Saturday and Sunday afternoons. The lake's marina, snack bar, swimming area and boat ramps were all removed, and restrictions were placed on boat operation. Today, the refuge is home to around 30 mammal species, including white-tailed deer, beavers, opossums, raccoons, fox squirrels, muskrats and coyotes. Many bird species also inhabit the refuge, such as bald eagles, great blue herons, egrets, pelicans, turkeys and cardinals. The refuge is also a major stopover on the Central Flyway bird migration route; the population of migratory birds increases substantially in the spring and fall months. The numbers of snow geese used to frequently be in the hundreds of thousands, but for unknown reasons has substantially dropped for only a few thousand a year (not at once). The population of Canada geese that stopped at the lake before it was channelized is once again rising. Several miles of nature trails provide access to the varied landscapes of the refuge. Dogs are permitted only under physical restrictive control of a leash at all times. Hunting is allowed in season (for deer, turkey, and pheasant) with a permit and there are several fishing piers along the lake, which are open outside of the bird migration seasons. The refuge also documents the area's human history. In 1865, the sternwheel steamboat Bertrand, bound for the Montana Territory, sank in the Missouri River. The boat and its cargo rested on the river bottom until 1968, when the wreck was rediscovered. Over 500,000 items were excavated from the wreck; many of them were in excellent condition. Catalogue numbers are now in the upper 5000's, each number sometimes only having one related object, or, in the case of nails, tens of thousands. A visitor center in the refuge displays many of these items. The Bertrand site is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. DeSoto National Wildlife Refuge is located 5 miles (8 km) east of Blair, Nebraska. Access to the refuge is on U.S. Route 30 between Blair and Interstate 29. { - valign=\\"top\\" DeSoto Lake was once part of the Missouri River, but rechannelization projects cut a large bend out of the river, forming the lake at Desoto NWR Red-headed woodpecker at DeSoto NWR.

History It was founded in 1876 as a boys' preparatory school for Cornell University. At this time Universities typically required students to be proficient in Latin and Greek. However, students from rural areas often did not have access to instruction in these subjects. Some early members of the Cornell faculty became concerned about the quality of education available to such students and founded Cascadilla School to address this inequity. However, students also pursued athletic activities such as football and crew and created yearbooks to record their activities.Current Headmisstress Patricia Kendall congratulates a graduating senior of the class of 2005. Shortly after the First World War, the school fell on hard financial times. They were forced to sell several buildings and parcels of land including the Cascadilla School Boathouse which still stands and is the center piece of Stewart Park. The building immediately south of the main classroom building once housed the dormitory, a dining hall, and a gymnasium, but now has been remodeled to serve as an apartment building and is privately owned and operated. In the later part of the 20th century, Headmaster Maxwell Kendall began to accept female students, created a board of trustees for the school, made Cascadilla independent of (although still affiliated with) Cornell University, obtained accreditation from the New York State Board of Regents, obtained not-for-profit status, and marketed the school to international students with great success. Cascadilla School Students make frequent use of the Cornell University libraries for study space and research. As shown here, they receive a special orientation to the library system each year. His son, John Kendall, former History and Math teacher at the school later took over as Headmaster and successfully opened the school up to students who were looking for an accelerated approach to their education. The accelerated program allows students to earn one unit of credit in one semester. In 1999 John Kendall's wife, Patricia Kendall, officially became the Dean of Students and in 2001 she took over as Headmistress, a position in which she serves to this day. Between 40 and 60 students from ten different countries are guided by a faculty of twelve teachers, many of whom hold advanced degrees. Typically, Cascadilla School students go on to four year colleges such as Binghamton University, Georgetown University, and New York University.Approximately 3,750 students have attended the Cascadilla School since 1876.

For example, it is sunnah (recommended) to supplicate with qunut in the witr prayer during the entire year.  Name  \\"Qun≈´t\\" () literally means \\"being obedient\\" or \\"the act of standing\\" in Classical Arabic. The word du øƒÅ' () is Arabic for supplication, so the longer phrase du øƒÅ' qun≈´t is sometimes used. Qunut has many linguistic meanings, such as humility, obedience and devotion. However, it is more understood to be a special du'a which is recited during the prayer.  History  Ahmad, Muhammad ibn \`Isa at-Tirmidhi, and Abu Dawood record that Hasan ibn Ali learned the prayer from Muhammad . Dawood further added that Muhammad used to recite al-Qunut whenever a major difficulty or disaster befell the Muslims. Ibn Ali said: \\"The Messenger of Allah taught me the [following] words to say during the witr prayer: \\"O Allah! Guide me with those whom You have Guided, and strengthen me with those whom You have given strength, take me to Your care with those whom You have taken to Your care, Bless me in what You have given me, Protect me from the evil You have Ordained. Surely You Command and are not commanded, and none whom You have committed to Your care shall be humiliated [and none whom You have Taken as an enemy shall taste glory]. You are Blessed, our Lord, and Exalted.\\" Muhammad used to recite Du'a al-Qunut during Salat al-Fajr, Witr and sometimes during other prayers throughout the year. It is one of those Sunnahs (Prophetic traditions) which many Muslims do not practice today. He would perform the Qunut in the last Rak'ah of the Salah after performing Ruku and saying \\"Sami'Allahu liman hamidah\\" (Allah listens to those who praise him); then put hands across navel/chest or raise hands (whilst still focusing on the place of Sujud) and supplicate the Qunut, after which He would make Sujud and conclude the prayer.  Customs  It is permissible to make the qunut before going into ruku (bowing), or it may be recited when one stands up straight after the ruku. Humaid says: \\"I asked Anas: 'Is the qunut before or after the ruku?' he said: 'We would do it before or after.\\" This hadith was related by Ibn Majah and Muhammad ibn Nasr. In Fath al-Bari, Ibn Hajar al-Asqalani comments that its chain is faultless. But widely, the scholars of Islam and the regular practice at Masjid al-Haram, Mecca, is to recite the Qunut Prayer after getting up from Ruku, in the last Rakah of Witr i.e., the 3rd Rakah of Witr at Isha (The late night prayer) According to the Hanafi opinion, one is supposed to give Takbir (Say Allahu Akbar and raise his palms till ear lobes and hold them back below or above navel with right hand over left) before going into Ruku in 3rd Rakah and recite the Following Qunut Prayer also called as Dua Qunut (Prayer of Qunut). After reciting the Dua, Muslims then bend in ruku and perform the rest of the Salath. Du'a qunut is recommended to be recited in the Witr prayer. The Witr prayer, according to Imam Abu Hanifah is wajib (obligation). The other Imams consider the Witr prayer as Sunnah Mu'akkadah (a recommendation). It can be offered after the Isha prayer right up to the break of dawn. The minority Ibadi school of Islam rejects the practice of qun≈´t altogetherLecture on Ibadi Islam by Valerie J. Hoffman. However, it is normative in all daily prayers among the Twelver Shia.

They were: *(1) New York Yankees (East Division champions, 97‚Äì65) vs. (4) Detroit Tigers (Wild Card, 95‚Äì67); Tigers win series, 3‚Äì1. *(2) Minnesota Twins (Central Division champions, 96‚Äì66) vs. (3) Oakland Athletics (West Division champions, 93‚Äì69); Athletics win series, 3‚Äì0. The higher seed (in parentheses) had the home field advantage, which was determined by playing record. The Athletics and Tigers met in the AL Championship Series, where a Detroit sweep made the Tigers the American League champions. The Tigers then faced the St. Louis Cardinals in the 2006 World Series, and lost, four games to one. Playoff race The AL playoff race of 2006 was unusually dramatic, with the last divisional championship and the wild card berth undecided until the final day of the season, and the most unlikely of all of the AL's playoff contenders taking the top spot in the AL Central and the second seed. In the AL East, the New York Yankees (97‚Äì65) clinched the division when the Boston Red Sox were eliminated from the playoffs by the Minnesota Twins (96‚Äì66) on September 20. The Oakland Athletics (92‚Äì69) clinched the AL West on September 26, and in the AL Central, the Twins won the division by a single game over the Wild Card Detroit Tigers (95‚Äì67) after Detroit‚Äîwho had led the division for the entire season‚Äîlost their last five games. Minnesota had set a torrid pace since June 7, after a horrible start. The Twins sewed up their playoff berth with an 8‚Äì1 win over the Kansas City Royals. They clinched the Central Division title, their fourth in five years, with a 5‚Äì1 victory and a 10‚Äì8 Detroit loss to the Royals on the last day of the season.

Matchups=New York Yankees vs. Detroit Tigers ‚Ä†: Game was postponed due to rain on October 4 Minnesota Twins vs. Oakland Athletics=New York vs. Detroit=Game 1 Yankee Stadium (I) in Bronx, New York The Yankees struck first with a five-run third inning off Nate Robertson, who allowed a leadoff single to Johnny Damon and subsequent double to Derek Jeter. Bobby Abreu doubled to score both men, Gary Sheffield singled in Abreu, and Jason Giambi capped the scoring with a two-run home run. In the fifth, the Tigers got on the board with a solo home run from Craig Monroe, then Brandon Inge singled with one out before back-to-back two- out RBI doubles by Pl√°cido Polanco and Sean Casey made it 5‚Äì3 Yankees, but Chien-Ming Wang struck out Magglio Ord√≥√±ez to end the inning. The Yankees added to their lead in the sixth off Robertson when Damon singled with two outs, then Jeter doubled before both men scored on Abreu's single. Curtis Granderson's home run in the seventh off Mike Myers made it 7‚àí4 Yankees, but they got that run back on Jeter's home run in the eighth off Jamie Walker. Mariano Rivera pitched a scoreless ninth while Jeter batted 5-for-5 in the game, becoming the sixth player to record five hits in one postseason game. Game 2 Yankee Stadium (I) in Bronx, New York Game 2 was postponed for one day due to rain. In the second inning, Craig Monroe doubled with two outs before scoring on Marcus Thames's single to give the Tigers a 1‚Äì0 lead. In the fourth, Johnny Damon launched a three-run home run off Justin Verlander to give the Yankees a 3‚Äì1 lead. That would be last time the Yankees would lead a game in the series, and the last time they would score until Game 4. Jamie Walker (who earned the victory in relief) and Joel Zumaya shut the Yanks down for the rest of the game. The Tiger hitters clawed their way back off Mike Mussina. In the fifth, Thames hit a leadoff double, moved to third on a wild pitch, and scored on a sacrifice fly from Curtis Granderson to cut the lead to one. Next inning, Carlos Guill√©n homered to tie the game and in the seventh, Thames hit a leadoff single, moved to second on a passed ball, then to third on a sacrifice bunt before scoring on Granderson's triple to give the Tigers a 4‚Äì3 lead. In the ninth, Todd Jones earned the save by getting Johnny Damon to fly out to center with one man on to end the game and even the series. Game 3 Comerica Park in Detroit, Michigan Feeding off a crowd witnessing its first playoff game in 19 years, Detroit pitcher Kenny Rogers pitched innings of scoreless ball, earning a victory and standing ovation from the Comerica Park crowd in a 6‚Äì0 Tigers win. Rogers was throwing as hard as 92 mph in the eighth inning, topping his usual top speed by 3‚Äì4 mph. Joel Zumaya used his 103-mph arm to close out the inning, and Todd Jones closed the game for the second time, but did not earn a save, as the Tigers were not in a save situation. Offensively, the Tigers got on the board off Randy Johnson in the second on three straight leadoff singles, the last of which by Sean Casey scoring Carlos Guillen. After Brandon Inge struck out, Curtis Granderson hit into a forceout at second to score Iv√°n Rodr√≠guez. It could have been a hit had Robinson Cano not made a great diving stop behind the bag to prevent the ball from going into the outfield. On a 1-2 pitch to Pl√°cido Polanco, Granderson appeared to be picked off base when Johnson threw to first baseman Jason Giambi, but the Yankees muffed the play when Johnson and Giambi both made poor throws to each base. Polanco capitalized on their mistake when he singled up the middle, scoring Granderson to make it 3‚àí0. In the sixth, Guillen singled with two outs before back-to-back RBI doubles by Rodriguez and Casey made it 5‚àí0 Tigers. Granderson capped the scoring with a leadoff home run off Brian Bruney in the seventh. Game 4 Comerica Park in Detroit, Michigan Detroit finished off New York behind another dominating pitching performance, this time by Jeremy Bonderman in an 8‚Äì3 clinching win. In the second inning, Magglio Ord√≥√±ez hit a leadoff home run and after Iv√°n Rodr√≠guez walked with one out, Craig Monroe homered off Jaret Wright to give the Tigers a 3‚Äì0 lead. Next inning, Ordonez reached on an error, moved to third on a single and scored on Rodrigeuz's single. Wright was replaced by Cory Lidle, who ended the inning without further damage and pitched a perfect fourth, but in the fifth, allowed three consecutive leadoff singles, the last of which to Ordonez scoring a run. After allowing an RBI double to Carlos Guillen, Lidle was relieved by Brian Bruney, who allowed a sacrifice fly to Rodriguez. Next inning, Scott Proctor allowed a two-out single to Pl√°cido Polanco, who scored on Sean Casey's double to make it 8‚àí0 Tigers. Bonderman, meanwhile, pitched a no-hitter through five innings. Robinson Can√≥ singled in the sixth for the Yankees' first hit, but Bonderman prevented any further damage. The Yankee hitters ended their 20-inning scoreless streak in the seventh when Derek Jeter hit a leadoff single, moved to third on Bobby Abreu's single and scored on Hideki Matsui's groundout. Bonderman left the game in the ninth inning with one on and one out. Jamie Walker gave up a two-out, two-run homer to Jorge Posada in the ninth before getting Robinson Can√≥ to ground out to end the game and send the Tigers to the 2006 ALCS against the Oakland Athletics. The game is notable as Cory Lidle's final appearance before dying in an airplane crash four days later, and was the final ALDS game televised by FOX due to the new TV contracts as of 2011.

Jay Payton singled with one out and scored on Marco Scutaro's two-out double. Barry Zito pitched shutout innings before Rondell White's seventh inning home run put the Twins on the board. Thomas's second home run in the ninth off Jesse Crain made it 3‚Äì1 A's. The Twins again made it a one-run game in the bottom of the inning when Michael Cuddyer hit a leadoff triple off Huston Street and scored on Torii Hunter's one-out groundout, but White flew out to end the game and give the A's a 1‚Äì0 series lead. Game 2 Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome in Minneapolis, Minnesota In Game 2, Nick Swisher doubled to lead off the fifth off Boof Bonser, then scored on Marco Scutaro's double. One out later, Jason Kendall's RBI single made it 2‚Äì0 Oakland. Back-to-back home runs by Michael Cuddyer and Justin Morneau leading off the bottom of the sixth off Esteban Loaiza tied the game. In the seventh, Mark Ellis singled with one out off Pat Neshek, then Mark Kotsay's inside-the-park home run off Dennys Reyes put Oakland back in front 4‚Äì2. They added another run in the ninth when Swisher hit a leadoff double off Juan Rincon, moved to third on a groundout and scored on a wild pitch by Joe Nathan. Huston Street pitched a scoreless bottom of the ninth despite allowing a single and walk to give the A's a 2‚Äì0 series lead. Game 3 McAfee Coliseum in Oakland, California The A's struck first in the bottom of the second on Eric Chavez's one-out home run off Brad Radke, who would retire following the series. Jay Payton then singled before scoring on Marco Scutaro's two-out double. Next inning, Mark Kotsay reached on an error before Milton Bradley's two-run home run made it 4‚Äì0 A's. Torii Hunter's home run in the fourth off Dan Haren put the Twins on the board. In the sixth, with Justin Morneau at third and Hunter at second, Rondell White's RBI single made it 4‚Äì2 A's, but Hunter was thrown out at home for the second out. In the seventh, Dennys Reyes walked two without outs before being relieved by Jesse Crain.

They were: *(1) New York Mets (East Division champions, 97‚Äì65) vs. (4) Los Angeles Dodgers (Wild Card, 88‚Äì74); Mets win series, 3‚Äì0. *(2) San Diego Padres (West Division champions, 88‚Äì74) vs. (3) St. Louis Cardinals (Central Division champions, 83‚Äì78); Cardinals win series, 3‚Äì1. The higher seed (in parentheses) had the home field advantage, which was determined by playing record. The Padres were awarded the Western Division title over the Dodgers due to their winning the season series against Los Angeles 13‚Äì5. The Mets and the Cardinals met in the NL Championship Series, with the Cardinals becoming the National League champion and going on to face the American League champion Detroit Tigers in the 2006 World Series. Playoff race The NL playoff race was highly dramatic when as many as six teams entered the final weekend of the regular season fighting for the final three playoff spots. Two of three division champions were decided on the final day of the regular season. The New York Mets began the season with high hopes of finally ending the Atlanta Braves' string of division titles. The Mets lived up to their high expectations and roared out of the gate, taking over first place in the division on the fourth day of the season and never looking back. They won seven of their first eight games, and had built up a double-digit lead in the standings by the end of June. The Mets clinched the division on September 18, and finished 12 games ahead of the Philadelphia Phillies. The Braves finished third, 18 games back. However, the Mets entered the postseason without injured ace Pedro Mart√≠nez, and learned the day before Game 1 of the Division Series that projected Game 1 starter Orlando Hern√°ndez would be lost for the whole round. The St. Louis Cardinals' run to their third consecutive Central Division championship pales in comparison to their runs in the previous two seasons. As before, the Cardinals took over the lead in the division early on, overtaking the Cincinnati Reds on June 9. It appeared as if this season would follow the established pattern as the Cardinals steadily built up their lead to as much as five and a half games and a 42‚Äì26 record on June 19. The Cardinals began interleague play by being swept by both the Chicago White Sox and Detroit Tigers as part of an eight-game losing streak. Despite the slump, they did not relinquish the division lead. The Reds were able to tie the Cardinals in the standings on June 30 and July 1, but the Cardinals regained sole possession of first place the following day and held onto the lead for the rest of the season despite additional losing streaks of eight and seven games. The Cardinals' struggles largely stemmed from the numerous injuries to key players throughout the season, including Albert Pujols, Jim Edmonds, David Eckstein, Chris Carpenter, Mark Mulder, and Jason Isringhausen. The title appeared to be well in hand on September 19 with leads of seven games over the Reds and eight and half games over the Houston Astros with just 13 games left to play. The Cardinals then went on another seven-game losing streak just as the Astros won seven consecutive, shrinking the Cardinals' lead to just a game and a half. The Cardinals were able to regain their composure, winning three of their next four and clinching on the final day of the season with an Astros loss to the Atlanta Braves. The San Diego Padres' playoff run was led by their strong pitching and saw closer Trevor Hoffman overtake Lee Smith as the all-time saves leader. This season also marked the first time in Padres history that the team went to the playoffs in consecutive years. The Padres did not clinch a playoff spot until the final weekend of the regular season and finished with an identical record to the Los Angeles Dodgers, but were awarded the Western Division title due to the Padres winning the season series against the Dodgers 13‚Äì5. The Los Angeles Dodgers' run to the playoffs was most notable for their streaky play in the second half of the season. The Dodgers started the second half by losing 13 out of 14 games and trailing the Padres by seven and a half games, in last place in the division, and behind eight teams in the wild card race. They immediately followed that streak by winning 17 of their next 18 to put them on top of the division by three and half games, with a better record than all eight teams they had trailed in the wild card race prior to the streak. Their inconsistent play continued as they were swept by the Padres in late August as part of a four-game losing streak, only to follow that up by winning seven consecutive, then losing their next three. The Dodgers finished the season strong by winning their final seven games, clinching a playoff berth in the final weekend over the Philadelphia Phillies and finishing tied with the Padres. The Dodgers were awarded the wild-card spot based on their 5-13 head-to-head record against San Diego, who earned the divisional championship. Matchups=New York Mets vs. Los Angeles DodgersSan Diego Padres vs. St. Louis Cardinals=New York vs. Los Angeles=Game 1 Shea Stadium in Queens, New York The game started off with Mets rookie starter John Maine on the mound as an emergency replacement for Orlando Hern√°ndez. Hern√°ndez was sidelined with a torn muscle, and ended up missing the rest of the postseason. Maine kept the Mets in the game with only one earned run in innings pitched. This game was notable for having two runners getting tagged out at home plate in the second inning. With runners on first and second and nobody out, catcher Russell Martin hit a line drive to the wall in right field. Jeff Kent tried to tag up from second base in the event that right fielder Shawn Green caught the ball. Instead, the ball sailed over Green's head. Both Kent and J. D. Drew raced around the bases towards the plate. Green threw to cut-off man Jos√© Valent√≠n, who relayed to Paul Lo Duca at the plate. Lo Duca was first able to tag out Kent. Drew, trying to score in desperation right behind Kent, was also tagged out at the plate. Lo Duca almost did not see Drew in time to slap the tag on. Martin would score on Marlon Anderson's double but Carlos Delgado and Cliff Floyd hit solo home runs in the fourth off of Derek Lowe. Lo Duca and Delgado singled in the sixth before scoring on David Wright's double to make it 4‚Äì1 Mets. In the seventh, Anderson hit a leadoff single off of Guillermo Mota and second baseman Valetin's error on Wilson Betemit's ground ball put runners on first and third with no outs for the Dodgers. After Julio Lugo struck out, Anderson scored on Rafael Furcal's single. After Furcal stole second, Nomar Garciaparra's two-out double tied the game,. In the bottom of the inning, reliever Brad Penny walked two with one out before Delgado's single and Wright's double scored a run each. In the ninth, closer Billy Wagner allowed a leadoff double to Betemit, who scored on Ramon Martinez's two-out double, but Garciaparra struck out to end the game as the Mets took a 1‚Äì0 series lead. Game 2 Shea Stadium in Queens, New York Game 2 pitted Dodgers rookie Hong-Chih Kuo against Tom Glavine. In the bottom of the third, outfielder Endy Ch√°vez hit a bunt single to lead off the inning. A wild pitch and subsequent ground out moved him to third before he scored on Jos√© Reyes's ground out. In the fifth, the Mets loaded the bases on a hit and two walks with one out off of Kuo, who was then relieved by Brett Tomko. Paul Lo Duca's sacrifice fly gave the Mets a 2‚Äì0 lead. In the sixth, the Mets loaded the bases again on two hits and an error with no outs. Mark Hendrickson relieved Tomko and got Endy Chavez to hit into a force out at home. Pinch-hitter Julio Franco's fielder's choice and Reyes's RBI single scored a run each. Wilson Betemit hit a home run in the eighth off of Aaron Heilman for the Dodgers but Wagner pitched a perfect ninth for his second save of the series. The Dodgers were hit with more bad news. Nomar Garciaparra was lost after a leg injury that would keep him off the field except for pinch-hitting duties. Game 3 Dodger Stadium in Los Angeles, California In Los Angeles, the Mets loaded the bases in the first with one out on a walk and two singles off of veteran starter Greg Maddux before RBI singles by David Wright, Cliff Floyd and Shawn Green put them up 3‚Äì0. In the third, Floyd singled with two outs before scoring on Green's double. In the fourth, the Dodgers loaded the bases on three singles off of Mets starter Steve Trachsel with one out before rookie first baseman James Loney, starting in place of the injured Nomar Garciaparra, drove in two with a single to center. In the fifth, Marlon Anderson singled with two outs before Jeff Kent's home run off reliever Darren Oliver tied the game at four. After allowing a single to J. D. Drew, Oliver was relieved by Chad Bradford, who allowed a single and walk to load the bases. Pedro Feliciano relieved Bradford and walked Loney to put the Dodgers up 5‚Äì4. In the top of the sixth, Shawn Green hit a leadoff double off of Jonathan Broxton. After Jos√© Valent√≠n popped out on the infield, pinch hitter Michael Tucker drew a walk. Three consecutive bloop hits from Jos√© Reyes, Paul Lo Duca, and Carlos Beltr√°n scored a run each, making it 7‚Äì5 Mets. Chris Woodward doubled to lead off the eighth off of Brett Tomko and scored on Lo Duca's one-out single. After a walk, Takashi Saito relieved Tomko and an error on Carlos Delgado's ground ball made it 9‚Äì5 Mets. Aaron Heilman and Billy Wagner pitched a scoreless eighth and ninth, respectively, as the Mets swept a postseason series for the first time since the 1969 NLCS. Former Dodgers Green and Lo Duca finished with two RBI each. Composite box 2006 NLDS (3‚Äì0): New York Mets over Los Angeles Dodgers San Diego vs. St. Louis=Game 1 Petco Park in San Diego, California In a pitching rematch of Game 1 of the 2005 NLDS, Chris Carpenter and Jake Peavy both started strong through three innings and it appeared that the pitcher's duel that was expected the previous year would occur this time around. That changed in the fourth inning when Chris Duncan hit a leadoff single, then Albert Pujols hit a two-run home run into one of the deepest parts of Petco Park. Jim Edmonds then singled, moved to third on Scott Rolen's double, and scored on Juan Encarnaci√≥n's sacrifice fly. The Cardinals added to their lead on Edmonds's RBI single next inning that scored David Eckstein from third and in the sixth when Ronnie Belliard singled with one out, stole second, and scored on Yadier Molina's single to knock Peavy out of the game. Carpenter, on the other hand, continued his strong pitching performance as he pitched into the seventh inning, allowing just one run to cross the plate when Dave Roberts tripled with one out in the sixth and scored on Brian Giles's sacrifice fly. The Cardinal bullpen, which had been shaky down the stretch, pitched the final innings of the game allowing just one hit. The Cardinals led the best-of-five series one game to none.Major League Baseball, Carpenter, Pujols Power Cards Game 2 Petco Park in San Diego, California Cardinal starter Jeff Weaver and four relievers combined on a four-hitter to shut out the Padres 2‚Äì0. The only runs scored in the game came in the fourth when Preston Wilson hit a leadoff double and scored on a single by Albert Pujols, who reached second on Dave Roberts's throw to home. Pujols moved to third on a groundout before scoring on Jim Edmonds's RBI single. Padres starter David Wells pitched five solid innings in a losing effort. Game 3 Busch Stadium (III) in St. Louis, Missouri Game 3 ended the Padres' eight-game winless streak against the Cardinals in the postseason and gave them their first postseason win since Game 6 of the 1998 NLCS. However, they left 14 runners on base. The Padres scored their runs in the third off of Jeff Suppan when he allowed a one-out double to Adri√°n Gonz√°lez and walked Mike Cameron before both men scored on Russell Branyan's double to left, with Branyan reaching third on Chris Duncan's throw to home. Branyan then scored on Geoff Blum's sacrifice fly. The Cardinals scored their only run in the eighth on So Taguchi's home run off of reliever Scott Linebrink. , this was the last postseason win for the Padres. Game 4 Busch Stadium (III) in St. Louis, Missouri After losing Game 3, Cardinals manager Tony La Russa decided to use Carpenter to start Game 4 in hopes of closing out the Series at home. Carpenter started off shakily, allowing back-to-back one hit singles to Brian Giles and Adri√°n Gonz√°lez and walking Josh Bard to load the bases. Russell Branyan walked to force in a run before Mike Cameron's groundout scored another. Carpenter settled down and pitched six scoreless innings before being pulled in the eighth. St. Louis answered by loaded the bases in the bottom of the inning off of Woody Williams on a single, walk and hit-by- pitch with two outs before Ronnie Belliard tied the game with a two-run single, but was tagged out at second to end the inning. The game remained tied until the seventh when Albert Pujols drew a leadoff walk and scored on Juan Encarnaci√≥n's triple. Williams was replaced with Cla Meredith, who hit Belliard with a pitch before allowing an RBI single to Scott Spiezio. Yadier Molina's single loaded the bases before Padre third baseman Branyan's throwing error to second on Carpenter's ground ball scored Belliard and kept the bases loaded. David Eckstein's sacrifice bunt scored Spiezio to give the Cardinals a 6‚Äì2 lead. Rookie pitcher Adam Wainwright pitched a scoreless ninth despite allowing two hits to close out the Series and allow the Cardinals to advance to the NLCS for the third consecutive year. The offensive woes that plagued the Padres in the first three games continued for the Padres in Game 4. The team failed to score after the first, and went a combined 2-for-32 with runners in scoring position in the Series. It was the final Division Series game televised by Fox, at least for the foreseeable future. This was the last playoff game for the Padres, until 2020.

She argued that these three processes had evolved to eliminate pathogens, carcinogens and other toxins from the body. Career A graduate of Harvard University, where she studied political philosophy with Harvey Mansfield and graduated in 1980, and University of California, Berkeley, where in 1985 she received a bachelor's degree in physics, Profet returned to school in 1994, studying mathematics at the University of Washington in Seattle, where she was awarded a \\"visiting scholar\\" position in the astronomy department, an allied discipline. Several years later, she returned to Harvard, once again to study math. When Profet won a MacArthur Fellowship in 1993, international media took notice. New York Times reporter Natalie Angier called Profet's theory that menstruation protected some female mammal's reproductive canals a \\"radical new view\\". Scientific American, Time, Omni, and even People Magazine all followed with in-depth profiles of the 35-year-old \\"maverick\\" scientific prodigy. Profet went on to publish two equally controversial bestselling books, 1995's Protecting Your Baby-To-Be: Preventing Birth Defects in the First Trimester and a 1997 follow up, Pregnancy Sickness: Using Your Body's Natural Defenses to Protect Your Baby-To-Be. Supporters‚Äîincluding U.C. Santa Barbara anthropologist Donald Symons and U.C. Berkeley toxicologist Bruce Ames‚Äîconsidered her work a pioneering analysis of evolutionary theory in a never-before-studied, everyday context. In 2008, Cornell University researchers Paul and Janet Shellman-Sherman found Profet's theory, that allergies are evolved ways to expel toxins and carcinogens--the so-called \\"toxin\\" or \\"prophylaxis hypothesis\\"--may explain a mysterious observation dating back to 1953 and replicated many times since: People with allergies are at much lower risk for some types of cancers, most notably the brain tumor glioma. While research has for decades supported Profet's prophylaxis hypothesis applied to carcinogens, Stanford University Medical School and Yale University Medical School researchers in 2013 reported similar experimental support applying it to toxins, specifically bee venom. Bee venom induces allergic reactions in some people that can include anaphylactic shock and death. Both studies were published in the journal Immunology. Yale immunology researchers Noah W. Palm, Ruslan Medzhitov, et al. reported that Phospholipase A2‚Äîthe major allergen in bee venom -- \\"is sensed by the innate immune system\\" and induces an immune response in mice that can protect against potentially fatal venom doses. Likewise, injecting mice with a small dose of bee venom conferred immunity to a much larger, fatal dose, Stanford researchers Stephen Galli, Thomas Marichal, and Philipp Starkl found. \\"Our findings support the hypothesis that this kind of venom-specific, IgE-associated, adaptive immune response developed, at least in evolutionary terms, to protect the host against potentially toxic amounts of venom, such as would happen if the animal encountered a whole nest of bees, or in the event of a snakebite,\\" Galli explained. The 2011 play The How and the Why by Sarah Treem draws on Profet's work on menstruation. Disappearance and discovery Profet vanished from Cambridge, Massachusetts: according to friends and colleagues, in 2005; according to family members, prior to 2005. Her whereabouts were unknown for more than seven years until she was found in Boston, Massachusetts, after a long ordeal with poverty and illness. She was reunited with her family in Southern California on May 16, 2012 as a result of nationwide attention from a May 2012 Psychology Today article.

It is one of the older residential areas of the Northern Suburbs, having been created as a residential area for the poorer relatives of the Randlords who had built their mansions on Parktown Ridge during the early days of the Rand gold rush (during the 1890s). It takes its name from being North of Parktown. The suburb has many old colonial-style houses, and manages to maintain a village atmosphere, despite being near to one of the busiest roads in the city, Jan Smuts Avenue. Parktown North is in close proximity to the Gautrain and has many bus stops that transport commuters to Gautrain stations. Many suburbs of Johannesburg are laid out as grids with numbered streets in one direction and numbered avenues intersecting perpendicularly. Parktown North is one of the only suburbs in Johannesburg to have only numbered avenues with no numbered streets. It is not a grid and the avenues run in all directions. The suburb is built around a small spring and lake, however this is not visible from the street and is hidden from the public separating the gardens of three private houses. Parktown North is a popular dining out venue for Johannesburg residents. Most notably 7th Avenue is home to many of the area's top restaurants. Parktown North has an active Residents Association (PNRA) that looks after its many interests around the suburb from Heritage, building and electrical issues, to power outage and maintenance issues.

Born in Rouzerville, Pennsylvania, he threw and batted right-handed, and was listed as tall and . Player and coach Heffner in 1940 Heffner entered professional baseball in 1929. After all or parts of four seasons with the then-minor league Baltimore Orioles, Heffner joined the New York Yankees for the 1934 season. He spent four seasons with the Yanks as a part-time player before a trade to the St. Louis Browns afforded him an opportunity to play regularly. He appeared in more than 100 games from 1938‚Äì41 with St. Louis, including regular stints at second base (1938; 1940‚Äì41) and shortstop (1939), before reverting to a reserve role. He finished his playing career with the Philadelphia Athletics and Detroit Tigers in 1943‚Äì44. In 743 games over all or parts of 11 American League seasons (1934‚Äì44), Heffner batted .241 with six home runs and 610 hits. In 1947, he began his managing career in the Browns‚Äô farm system, and he promptly won consecutive pennants in his first two seasons. He returned to the Major Leagues as a coach with the Athletics, now based in Kansas City, in 1958‚Äì60 and the Tigers in 1961. Heffner then spent two successful seasons managing the San Diego Padres of the Pacific Coast League, winning the 1962 league championship, before becoming third-base coach of the New York Mets in 1964‚Äì65. Brief term as Reds' skipper In October 1965, he succeeded Dick Sisler as manager of the Cincinnati Reds. Heffner was hired by longtime associate Bill DeWitt, the Reds‚Äô owner and general manager who was the front office boss of the Browns during Heffner's playing days. The Reds were a first division finisher in 1965 and hopes were high for a pennant run the following year‚Äîespecially after DeWitt added front-line starting pitcher Milt Pappas in a blockbuster trade with Baltimore involving former National League most valuable player Frank Robinson. But while the Orioles roared to the AL pennant and world championship in 1966, the Reds never got on track under their new skipper. Heffner tried to convert all-star second baseman Pete Rose into a third baseman, only to draw the popular star's wrath. (Oddly, Rose would later willingly become a third baseman for Sparky Anderson). The Reds struggled to reach the .500 mark during the season's first three months, and finally peaked at 36‚Äì35 on June 28. Cincinnati then proceeded to lose 11 games in a row. They broke their losing streak in the last game before the All-Star break on July 10. But it was too late to save Heffner's job. With Cincinnati in eighth place in the National League with a record of 37‚Äì46 (.446) on July 13, Heffner was released in favor of Dave Bristol, who was serving as his third-base coach. Heffner never again managed in the Major Leagues, although he spent 1967‚Äì68 as a California Angels coach and 1969 as manager of the Denver Bears of the American Association. He died at age 78 in Pasadena, California. He was interred at Mountain View Cemetery and Mausoleum in Altadena.
