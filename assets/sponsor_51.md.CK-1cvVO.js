Later arms of the Rosenbergs, with elements from the Orsini family arms. V√≠tkovci, Lords of Rose, wallpainting by Mikol√°≈° Ale≈°. Ro≈æmberk (with a red rose) is in the middle. The Rosenberg family (Ro≈æmberkov√© in Czech, sg. z Ro≈æmberka) was a prominent Bohemian noble family that played an important role in Czech medieval history from the 13th century until 1611. Members of this family held posts at the Prague royal (and later imperial) court, and they were viewed as very powerful lords of the Kingdom of Bohemia. This branch of the V√≠tkovci clan was initially founded by V√≠tek III, the son of V√≠tek (German: Witiko) of Prƒçice. History Around 1250, the V√≠tkovci clan settled at the Ro≈æmberk Castle in the region of ƒåesk√Ω Krumlov, then about 1253 erected the ƒåesk√Ω Krumlov castle. The Krumlov castle thus became the residence of the Lords of Ro≈æmberk for the next three hundred years. It was the Ro≈æmberks who influenced the appearance of southern Bohemia to a great extent. The coat of arms and emblem of this family was represented by a red five-petalled rose on a silver field, which is still often seen in a considerable part of southern Bohemia. Peter I of Ro≈æmberk held the post of the superior chamberlain at the court of John of Bohemia. His wife was a widow of the Bohemian king Wenceslaus III. Another significant personage of the family was Jind≈ôich III of Ro≈æmberk, a son of Old≈ôich I, who led the Union of Nobility, being displeased during the reign of King Wenceslaus IV. Jind≈ôich's son, Old≈ôich II of Ro≈æmberk, was a member of the Bohemian nobility who defended the interests of Bohemian catholic nobility and of Sigismund, Holy Roman Emperor, during the times of the Hussite wars. A daughter of Old≈ôich II was Perchta of Ro≈æmberk, who is identified with the Ro≈æmberks \\"White Lady\\" ghost tales, and current residents of the area still report seeing Perchta's spirit around the castle. The decline of the House of Ro≈æmberk began with Vil√©m and Petr Vok, the sons of Jo≈°t III, both being raised under the guardianship of their uncle, Peter V. Vil√©m of Ro≈æmberk is generally considered the most significant representative of the family, making the ƒåesk√Ω Krumlov area the center of southern Bohemian cultural and political life. After Vil√©m's death in 1592, his younger brother, Petr Vok, assumed the position of reigning lord. In 1601, he was forced to sell the Krumlov castle to Rudolf II, Holy Roman Emperor. Petr Vok transferred his residence after the sale to T≈ôebo≈à, where he died in 1611. Petr Vok brought to a close the three- hundred-year-long reign of this illustrious dynasty.

The 115 km long line originally ran from Chemnitz in a southwesterly direction along the valley of the River Zw√∂nitz to Aue. From Aue the line ran along the Zwickauer Mulde to Muldenberg and up to Sch√∂neck and through Markneukirchen to Adorf in Vogtland. The line was cut in two by the construction of the Eibenstock dam reservoir in 1975. The two truncated end sections are still in use, with the Vogtlandbahn railway company operating over the south western section from Adorf to Muldenburg, and the Erzgebirgsbahn railway company operating the Chemnitz to Aue section under the name Zw√∂nitz Valley Railway (German: Zw√∂nitztalbahn). History =Background and Construction= In July 1872 the Chemnitz-Aue-Adorfer Eisenbahn-Gesellschaft gained the concession to build and operate a railway line from Chemnitz through Aue und Sch√∂neck to Adorf in Vogtland. The S√§chsische Eisenbahnbaugesellschaft were given the contract to construct the line, but there were financial difficulties so suddenly, in 1874, the contract was taken back in house. The topology of the line presented challenges but the work was completed by 15 November 1875. The Zwickauer Mulde valley section between Aue‚ÄìEibenstock‚ÄìSch√∂neck/Vogtl. was ready for opening on 7 September 1875. On 24 December 1875 the complementary line, the 8 km long Zweigbahn from Zwotental to the Czech border at Klingenthal was opened. Here it joined to the Falkenau‚ÄìGraslitz(‚ÄìBorder) line of the Buschtiehrader Eisenbahn. But even in the first year of operation, the takings were below expectation and the company sold the line on 15 July 1876 to the Saxony government. This was the end of the CAAE and their planned extension to Hof, Germany, in Bavaria. =Operations= The Royal Saxon State Railways ran the line under the name CA (taking the letters from Chemnitz and Adorf). A planned extension was never implemented. Due to the unfavourable topology of the line, with long climbs and tight corners in the region of L√∂ssnitz and Sch√∂neck, made it unsuitable for heavy goods trains. The short section between Aue und Zw√∂nitz was known as the S√§chsischer Semmering, the line climbed 255 m. In 1920 the Chemnitz-Aue- Adorfer railway passed to the newly formed Deutsche Reichsbahn. After World War II regional express trains ran from Dresden and Chemnitz to Adorf. On 1 March 1967 the former mainline was reclassified as a branch line. =Extensions= From 1899 to 1970 a goods line ran from Zw√∂nitz to Stollberg to bring the coal from the Oelsnitzer Revier in the Erzgebirge. The track was removed on closure. In 1900, it was extended through Beierfeld und Elterlein to Scheibenberg. This line fell to the Soviet Union as a war reparation and was closed and removed in 1945. The district capital of Auerbach was connected to the line in 1891/92 by means of a short connection from Falkenstein/Vogtl. and Muldenberg. On 15 November 1892 the line was opened and it is still in use today by the Vogtlandbahn as part of the Zwickau‚ÄìKraslice route. Only a short connecting line was needed from the CA-Linie to the town Eibenstock which was opened in 1905 and ran until 5 October 1975. This was the most precipitous line in Saxony with a gradient of 1:20 or 50 ‚Ä∞. A further extension was from Siebenbrunn to Erlbach, this gave a direct connection to Markneukirchen. Traffic ran to Markneukirchen from 20 September 1910, and to Erlbach from 1 October 1911. The line closed 1 June 1975. . =Contraction= In 1975 the section between Wolfsgr√ºn und Sch√∂nheide was permanently cut by the successful construction of the Talsperre Eibenstock reservoir. The last train between Adorf and Karl-Marx-Stadt (Chemnitz) was on 27 September 1975, as was the last train on the short stretch to Eibenstock ob. Bf. Passenger trains continued between Karl-Marx-Stadt and Blauenthal, and also between Sch√∂nheide Ost und Adorf. The service between Sch√∂nheide Ost and Sch√∂nheide S√ºd finished 1 January 1979. The section to Muldenberg closed on 23 May 1982. Goods traffic continued to Sch√∂nheide ost until 1995. The passenger service from Aue to Blauenthal was also withdrawn in 1995. =Reorganisation= Vogtlandbahn RegioSprinter near Sch√∂neck The Vogtlandbahn has been running trains on this section from Muldenberg to Adorf since 1997. As part of regeneration project for derelict lines in 1996, the tracks were rebuilt to 80 km/h standard. This section is used by VB5 Hof- Plauen - Falkenstein - Adorf, using Duewag RegioSprinter train sets. Then in 2002 the section from Chemnitz to Aue was opened by the DB Erzgebirgsbahn, and in 2003 this section was upgraded to 80 km/h standard. And since 2005 whole section is now back in service. Construction work remains (May 2008) particularly at the level crossings. This section is now known as the Zw√∂nitztalbahn. Chemnitz is a centre for a train-tram experiment. Here the low floored trains run on tram lines through the city, both using the and adapting to the two power systems. =Further Usage= On 6 October 2007 a 2.8 kilometer stretch of the track between Sch√∂nheide S√ºd and Rautenkranz was brought back in service. The Wests√§chsische Eisenbahn (FHWE) railway preservation group has created a museum railway running the Wernesgr√ºner Schienen-Express.  Description of the line  The Chemnitz-Aue-Adorfer railway leaves Chemnitz Hauptbahnhof with the tracks of the Dresden‚ÄìWerdau line towards the west. In Chemnitzer S√ºdbahnhof the track branches south. After a junction with the line to Stollberg, the line follows the Zw√∂nitztal, and this section is known as the Zw√∂nitztalbahn. At the former Zw√∂nitz station the tracks cross the watershed of the Zwickauer Mulde. The tracks follow the L√∂√ünitztal downwards into Aue. Aue was one of the biggest and most notable stations on the former CA line. Today the station mainly used by Erzgebirgsbahn passenger trains. There is no goods traffic. Aue is a terminus for the Zwickau‚ÄìJohanngeorgenstadt line. The next section, from Aue to Muldenberg, has been closed since 1995. After the Aue station the tracks make an arc around the town centre and lead down the Muldetal. Shortly before Bockau is one of the two tunnels on the line. The tracks have been removed and the track bed is part of a cycle way between Aue and Eibenstock. The track bed continues through Wolfsgr√ºn station to Eibenstock. The Talsperre Eibenstock reservoir cuts the line, and floods the former Eibenstock unterer Bahnhof, which was the starting point of the steep line to the Eibenstock oberen Bahnhof. The second tunnel on the line is also beneath the reservoir. From Sch√∂nheide Ost station the track bed resumes. In Muldenberg the tracks take Vogtlandbahn running from Falkenstein and ascend to Sch√∂neck on the crest of the Erzgebirge. It steeply descends to Zwotental where the branch to Klingenthal and Kraslice joins. Descending further the track reaches Adorf in Elstertal where it meets the Plauen-Cheb line which was originally the Herlasgr√ºn-Eger line of the Vogtl√§ndischen Staatseisenbahn.

Introduction The phenomenon was first named and identified as an areal characteristic of the Mesoamerican linguistic area in Smith Stark (1988). Some sources also refer to pied-piping with inversion as \\"secondary wh-movement\\". The phenomenon can be described as follows: *the language has wh-movement. *the language has pied-piping. That is, when certain words undergo wh- movement, not only the interrogative word, but the phrase which contains this word moves. *the word order within the pied-piped phrase is different from the order of ordinary phrases. The following examples from San Dionisio Ocotepec Zapotec illustrate the phenomenon. As the following example shows, a possessor normally follows the noun that is possessed in this language (Broadwell 2001): : 1) C√π‚Äô√° Ju√†√†ny [NP x-p√®‚Äôcw M√†r√≠√≠]. ::com:grab Juan p-dog Mary ::‚ÄòJuan grabbed Mary‚Äôs dog.‚Äô ::*C√π‚Äô√° Ju√†√†ny [NP M√†r√≠√≠ x-p√®‚Äôcw]. ::com:grab Juan Mary p-dog If the possessor is questioned, then the whole noun phrase must pied- pipe to the beginning of the sentence. However, the order of the initial phrase must have the possessor before the possessed: : 2) ¬ø[NPT√∫√∫ x-p√®h‚Äôcw] c√π‚Äô√° Ju√†√†ny? ::who p-dog com:grab Juan ::‚ÄòWhose dog did Juan grab?‚Äô ::* ¬ø[NPX- p√®h‚Äôcw t√∫√∫] c√π‚Äô√° Ju√†√†ny? ::p-dog who com:grab Juan The difference in order between the noun phrases in (1) and (2) illustrates pied-piping with inversion. (1) shows the ordinary order in which the noun is the first element of the noun phrase; (2) shows the inverted order found in the pied-piped noun phrase. The following examples from Tzotzil (Aissen 1996) show the same process: : 3) I-cham [NPx-ch‚Äôamal li Xun]-e ::com-die A3-child the Xun-enc ::‚ÄòXun‚Äôs child died.‚Äô : 4) [NPBuch‚Äôu x-ch‚Äôamal] i-cham? ::who A3-child com- die ::‚ÄòWhose child died?‚Äô Types of phrases that show pied-piping with inversion Pied-piping with inversion is most often found in noun phrases (NP), prepositional phrases (PP), and quantifier phrases (QP). The following example, also from San Dionisio Ocotepec Zapotec, shows pied-piping with inversion in a quantifier phrase (Broadwell 2001): : 5a) ¬ø[Xh√≠√≠ ty√≥p] √π-d√†w Ju√†√†ny? ::what two com-eat Juan ::‚ÄòWhat did Juan eat two of? : 5b) ¬ø[Ty√≥p xh√≠√≠] √π-d√†w Ju√†√†ny? ::two what com-eat Juan ::‚ÄòWhat did Juan eat two of?‚Äô As this example shows, languages may differ in the degree to which pied-piping with inversion is obligatory in different types of phrases. So (2) above shows that the interrogative must be initial in a pied-piped noun phrase. But (5) shows that the interrogative is only optionally initial in a pied-piped quantifier phrase. The following example, from Quiegolani Zapotec (Black 2000) shows pied-piping with inversion in a prepositional phrase: : 6a) [Txu lo] n-dux xnaa noo? ::who to stat-angry mother 1ex ::‚ÄòWith whom was my mother angry?‚Äô : 6b) *[Lo txu] n-dux xnaa noo? ::to who stat-angry mother 1ex Environments for pied-piping with inversion The most frequently cited type of sentence with pied-piping with inversion is a wh-question. However, a number of Mesoamerican languages also show fronting of negative or indefinite phrases to a position before the verb. Fronted negative and indefinite phrases may also show pied-piping with inversion in some languages, as in this example from San Dionisio Ocotepec Zapotec: 7.) a.) R√∫-t√®‚Äôc√† [t√∫√∫ x-p√®‚Äôcw] √π-d√≠√≠ny M√†r√≠√≠. animate:negative anyone p-dog com-hit Maria ‚ÄòMaria didn‚Äôt hit anyone‚Äôs dog.‚Äô b.) *R√∫-t√®‚Äôc√† [x-p√®‚Äôcw t√∫√∫] √π-d√≠√≠ny M√†r√≠√≠. animate:negative p-dog anyone com-hit Maria The noun phrase 'anyone's dog' has been fronted to a position before the verb, and shows the same pied-piping with inversion seen in other syntactic environments. Languages that show pied-piping with inversion Pied-piping with inversion seems to be found in all Mesoamerican languages. It is documented in many of them, including several Zapotec languages (San Dionisio Ocotepec Zapotec, Tlacolula de Matamoros Zapotec, and Quiegolani Zapotec), several Mayan languages (K'ichee', Kaqchikel, Chuj, Tzotzil), and several Mixtecan languages (Ocotepec Mixtec, and Copala Triqui). Pied-piping with inversion is unusual outside Mesoamerica but is documented in Sasak, an Austronesian language of Indonesia (Austin 2001). A somewhat similar phenomenon is found in a number of Germanic languages, in which certain pronominal objects of prepositions appear before the preposition.van Riemsdijk 1978. The following Dutch examples show that ordinary objects follow the preposition op 'on', while the pronouns er 'it', daar 'there', and hier 'here' precede the preposition: : Ik reken [op je steun]. (\\"I count on your support.\\") : Ik reken erop/daarop/hierop (\\"I count on it/on that/on this.\\") These examples show inversion of a prepositional phrase, but this inversion does not necessarily occur in contexts of pied- piping. Possibly related is the phenomenon known as swiping,Merchant 2002. which a wh-phrase is inverted with a governing preposition in the context of sluicing: : Ralph was arguing, but I don't know who with. Such inversion requires pied-piping but also ellipsis unlike Meso-American languages. See also * Syntax * Mesoamerican linguistic area * Wh-movement * Sasak Notes References * Aissen, Judith. 1996.

It is located some six miles to the south east of Leamington Spa and is very close to the M40 motorway. The village began life in the 1950s, situated to the north of RAF Gaydon it housed the married airmen and officers (those unmarried lived in barracks). Before that time the site was just farmland between Gaydon and Lighthorne with a few isolated buildings. After just over thirty years of active service most of the smaller houses on the base were sold off to Stratford District Council between 1976 and 1981. Throughout the 1980s the larger houses were sold on the open market by the Ministry of Defence.Lighthorne online The runway and RAF buildings were taken over in 1978 by British Leyland, and became a proving ground for its cars. This evolved into the Gaydon centre (where Land Rover has its headquarters) and the British Motor Museum, a museum of many British cars. More recently Aston Martin built a factory here for its car production. The village got its own parish council in 2003.Parish council plans to regenerate the area Before 2003 it shared a Parish Council with Lighthorne, a village 800m to the west.

Previously the pysanka collection had been housed in the Kolomyia church of the Annunciation. The museum is part of the National Museum of Hutsulshchyna and Pokuttya Folk Art. The central part of the museum is in the shape of a pysanka (Ukrainian Easter egg). This is the only museum in the world dedicated to the pysanka, and it has become a calling card of the city. In August 2007 the museum was recognized as a landmark of modern Ukraine. The museum was opened on 23 September 2000, during the 10th International Hutsul festival. Director Yaroslava Tkachuk first came up with the idea of a museum in the shape of a pysanka, local artists Vasyl Andrushko and Myroslav Yasinskyi brought the idea to life. The museum is not only shaped like an egg (14 m in height and 10 m in diameter), but parts of the exterior of and inside of the dome are painted to resemble a pysanka.  Museum collections  At this time, the museum possesses a collection of over 10,000 pysanky. The permanent collection includes pysanky from the majority of the oblasts of Ukraine. Many are modern re-creations of traditional designs, including a recreation by Oksana Bilous and Zoya Stashuk of the Skarzhynska collection (as depicted by Kulzhynsky), but there is also a fine collection of older pysanky from the Ivano-Frankivsk region that date from the 19th and 20th centuries. There are many examples of both pysanky and other forms of decorated eggs from other Slavic countries (Belarus, the Czech Republic, Poland) and more distant lands (Romania, Sweden, United States, Canada, France, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, India). The museum also presents temporary exhibitions in its galleries, usually collections of folk or original pysanky by local pysankary. Other exhibits are usually related to the pysanka and Hutsul Easter traditions, but can also encompass other folk arts. Another special collection at the museum are pysanky decorated with hand-signatures by all Ukrainian presidents and most of First Ladies, and by foreign politicians who visited the museum.

Together with the other \\"numbered\\" names like \\"Kamakura's Ten Wells\\" and \\"Kamakura's Ten Bridges\\", the modern \\"Seven Entrances\\" is an Edo period invention probably concocted to stimulate tourism.Kawano (2005:24-25) The Azuma Kagami calls them simply -zaka: Kobukurozaka, Daibutsuzaka, Gokurakuzaka, etc. Besides these seven, there were always other mountain roads that connected Kamakura with, for example, Kotsubo and Shichirigahama. There is one, for example, that connects Kaiz≈ç-ji in ≈ågigayatsu with Kita-Kamakura Station.Kawano (2005:301) The Seven Entrances were simply the most convenient and important. While economically vital because they allowed traffic to and from the outside world, the Seven Passes had also great military value, and as such they were fortified in various ways, for example narrowing them further until a horse could barely pass through, and obstructing the view of incomers. The roads were also modified adding artificial cliffs and forts from which archers could hit enemies below.  The Seven Entrances  = The Asaina Pass = The Sabur≈ç Falls at the beginning of the Asaina PassAlso known as and commonly called , the connected Kanazawa (today part of the city of Yokohama) to Kamakura, while at the same time protecting its eastern flank. The Azuma Kagami reports that the decision to link the city to Kanazawa was taken in 1240 by Shikken H≈çj≈ç Yasutoki. Its name seems to stem from the legend that superhuman hero Asahina (or Asaina) Sabur≈ç Yoshihide (a historical figure and Wada Yoshimori's third son) built it by himself in one night. The falls near the Kamakura entrance to the pass, the , are also named after him.Juniso/Jomyoji Area by the Kamakura Citizen Net, accessed on June 2, 2008 The whole pass has been declared a historical landmark.

Its date of construction is unknown, and the Azuma Kagami doesn't mention it.

According to tradition, the pass was opened by the founder of Gokuraku-ji, Ninsh≈ç (1217‚Äì1303). The pass was chosen by Nitta Yoshisada for his 1333 attack on Kamakura and saw therefore ferocious fighting. The stele on the pass says:Japanese text available here: > This place used to be a hill but Ninsh≈ç, the founder of Gokuraku-ji, had it > flattened and opened this road.

It is published by Gannett in Alexandria, the seat of Rapides Parish and the economic center of Central Louisiana. The daily newspaper has a circulation of some 19,500 daily and 27,500 on Sundays. It covers the news primarily in seven parishes with a population of approximately 400,000. The coverage area reaches from the Mississippi River on the east to the Texas border on the west. The Town Talk was born on St. Patrick's Day, March 17, 1883. It was owned by the original Irish-American founders, including Edgar Hammond McCormick and Henarie Morrison Huie, and their heirs until 1996, when it was sold to Central Newspapers of Indianapolis, then the 15th-largest newspaper company in the United States. The parent company was called \\"McCormick & Company Inc.\\" Central Newspapers was purchased in 2000 by Gannett of McLean, Virginia, was owned until his death by Eugene S. Pulliam, the maternal uncle of former Vice President of the United States J. Danforth Quayle. In 1962, Joe D. Smith, Jr. (1922‚Äì2008) became publisher of The Town Talk. He was the husband of Jane Wilson Smith (1922‚Äì1992), a McCormick heir whose family owned the newspaper. Over the years, Smith was also the general manager, president, and chairman of the board. Under his tutelage, The Town Talk became the first daily newspaper in Louisiana to become computerized. He took the view that newspapers were expected to foster growth and improvement in the community as well as report the news.http://www.thetowntalk.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20080323/OPINION/803220327 Some four years after the death of Jane Smith, the newspaper‚Äôs owning company sold to Central Newspapers for $62 million. On the acquisition of The Town Talk, Louis A. Weil III, Central Newspapers' chief executive officer, said that under Smith's leadership, \\"the newspaper has become one of the premier medium-sized dailies in the South. It fits with our goal of acquiring newspaper properties with a strong position in their market area and a proven history of journalistic integrity.\\" Weil's analysis was in sharp contrast to that of Adras LaBorde, who in 1945 launched a 32-year career with the newspaper. At the time, LaBorde described The Town Talk as \\"an overgrown country weekly published on a six-day basis.\\" The publication had indeed changed little in the years between 1925 and 1945.Adras LaBorde, quoted in Fredrick M. Spletstoser, Talk of the Town: The Rise of Alexandria, Louisiana, and the Daily Town Talk, Louisiana State University Press, 2005, p. 130 LaBorde retired on Jan. 1, 1977, succeeded by Jim Butler, who would be the newspaper‚Äôs top news executive until May 2003, when he retired. Butler went to work on The Town Talk wire desk in November 1967. Subsequently he was a reporter, outdoor writer, and city editor. He returned to newspapering in 2004 and shared a Pulitzer Prize as night editor of the Gulfport, MS Sun Herald for work in the wake of Hurricane Katrina. He later edited newspapers in Eunice (La. State Newspapers) and Leesville and DeRidder (Gatehouse) and was content editor of LSN web sites in Ville Platte, Crowley, Abbevville and other cities. The Town Talk shifted from afternoon weekday publication and Sunday morning publication to seven-day morning delivery in the late 1970s. In the same decade it returned to job printing that had been a part of its initial business, creating McCormick Graphics. In 1981, its business offices, advertising, news, composing and human relations offices moved across Second Street to the newly acquired former JC Penney building at Third and Washington. The planned temporary move became permanent. The newspaper celebrated its 100th birthday in 1983 with a six-section history of the company and the area it served and with a widely acclaimed photo exhibit. Twice in the 1980s The Town Talk was recognized by the American Society of Newspaper Editors as one of the top 15 under-50,000 circulating daily newspapers in the U.S. Its management, news and advertising staffs were active in local, state and national organizations and received numerous awards. The newspaper was several times named Newspaper of the Year by the Louisiana Press Assn. On July 7, 2003, Paul V. Carty became executive editor of The Town Talk. Prior to his appointment, he was the managing editor of Gannett's Star-Gazette in Elmira, New York. Carty started his journalism career in 1980 at the Clearwater Sun in Clearwater, Florida, owned by Jefferson-Pilot Communication. He aldo worked for newspapers owned by Landmark Communications Inc. in Norfolk, Virginia, and Elizabethtown, Kentucky; and for Knight Ridder Inc. in State College, Pennsylvania, and Bradenton, Florida. He is a former instructor in the Pennsylvania State University's College of Communications.tp://www.gannett.com/go/newswatch/2003/june/nw0627-1.htm Other key members of the news and editorial staff, as of 2009, included Richard Powell Sharkey, assistant managing editor for news and features; John Marcase, assistant managing editor for news and sports; Cynthia Jardon, editorial page editor and social media editor; Mandy M. Goodnight, news editor; and Randall Benson, sports editor. Under the McCormick heirs, The Town Talk considered itself a politically Independent newspaper and did not endorse candidates. In 1996, however, it backed the Democrat Mary Landrieu in her narrow but successful race for the United States Senate against the Republican Woody Jenkins. The Town Talk urged Landrieu to move to the right politically because Jenkins' positions were \\"far too rigid and unyielding to warrant our recommendation.\\"\\"Jenkins, Landrieu trade blows\\", Minden Press-Herald, October 29, 1996, p. 1. In 2004, it endorsed Alexandria Republican Jock Scott in his unsuccessful race for the U.S. House of Representatives for Louisiana's 5th congressional district. In 2007, it supported Republican Bobby Jindal in his successful race for governor.Central La.

News director Jim Smilie noted that the newspaper throughout its history had always been located in the downtown Alexandria area and would remain at that preferred location. Beginning April 5, 2017, The Town Talk will reduce its printed editions from seven to three days per week. Hard copies will be delivered henceforth only on Wednesday, Friday, and Sunday. The change is being undertaken because far more read the newspaper on-line than depend on actual deliveries. Judi Terzotis, the president of The Town Talk, said that the change is driven by both customers and advertisers. The Town Talk has eight times more digital reader than print readers. In 2016, the publication had 3.4 million visitors and 22 million page views.

Scott, 113 U.S. 340 (1885), regarded a suit brought to contest a will which directed land to be conveyed to or divided among remaindermen at the expiration of a particular estate, are to be presumed, unless clearly controlled by other provisions, to relate to the beginning of enjoyment by remaindermen, and not to the vesting of the title in them..  Background  General Duncan McArthur, the former governor of Ohio, established a trust in his will that required that land in Ross County, Ohio be kept in the family. His ancestors later wanted to sell the land. A testator devised lands and personal property to his executors and their successors and their heirs, in trust, and directed that the income, until his youngest grandchild who might live to be twenty-one years of age should arrive at that age, should be divided equally among the testator's children or the issue of any child dying, and among the grandchildren also as they successively came of age; that \\"after the decease of all my children, and when and as soon as the youngest grandchild shall arrive at the age of twenty-one years,\\" the lands should be \\"inherited and equally divided between my grandchildren per capita,\\" in fee, and that \\"in like manner\\" the personal property should \\"at the same time be equally divided among my said grandchildren, share and share alike per capita,\\" and that if any grandchild should have died before the final division leaving children, they should take and receive per stirpes the share which their parent would have been entitled to have and receive if then living, and provided that any assignment, mortgage, or pledge by any grandchild of his share should be void, and the executors, in the final division and distribution, should convey and pay to the persons entitled under the will. Held that the executors took the legal title in fee, to hold until the final division, and that the trusts were imposed upon them as executors. Held, also that all the grandchildren took equitable vested remainders, opening to let in those born after the testator's death, and subject to be divested only as to any grandchild who died before the expiration of the particular estate, leaving issue, by an executory devise over to such issue.  Decision  The grandchildren of the testator, the lawful issue of his five enumerated children, formed one class of beneficiaries provided for in the will. As a class, their interests were opposed to the contestants. Those of the class who were in being took the title as well for themselves as for those who should be afterwards born. The interests of those in being and those born afterwards were in all respects the same. It would seem, therefore, that whatever bound those who held the title should bind all those not then in being for whom they held it. Otherwise, as in Ohio no suit can be brought to contest a will except within two years after probate. It is difficult to see how a will can be contested there when the devise is to a class of persons which may not be full until after that period has elapsed. It is no part of the duty of executors to defend a will against a contest. That is left to the devisees or those interested in sustaining the will. As this, in our opinion, disposes of the case, we have deemed it unnecessary to refer specially to any of the other questions which were presented in argument. Associate justice Stanley Matthews, having been of counsel, did not sit in this case, or take any part in the decision.

Aarhus N is an abbreviation for Aarhus Nord (lit. \\"Aarhus North\\") and is located north of the city centre. It is the highest lying area of Aarhus. Many of the neighborhoods in the district were once small, separated farms and villages, but developed and grew through the Industrial Revolution and later merged with the rest of Aarhus. Aarhus N has 34,512 inhabitants (2016 statistics).  Boroughs and neighbourhoods  = Christiansbjerg = Christiansbjerg. Apartment blocks and public housing built in the 1930s and 1940s. Nobelparken, a relatively new department of Aarhus University. Christiansbjerg is one of Aarhus's older boroughs, located beyond the historic city center. In the 1500-1800s, this area was covered by agricultural fields and pastures with grazing livestock. In the 1800s, several larger farms was built here and their names, such as Katrinebjerg, Regineh√∏j, H√∏jvang and Vorreg√•rd, are still in use today. In the beginning of the 1900s, the development of Christianbjerg was initiated as a small independent town, but the urban constructions really first took off in the 1930s and 1940s, when a lot of new houses and apartments were erected.Neighbourhood of the Proletariat Bymuseet. Homepage of Aarhus Citymuseum. Now several urban squares has given the borough its own structure and identity, with an urban center on Stjernepladsen (lit.: the star square) and many shops and small businesses. In recent decades large institutions and storehouses have also appeared. The area has easy access to and from the harbour and the city centre of Aarhus and comprise large residential areas, educational institutions, many facilities for sports, the large shopping mall of Storcenter Nord (recently expanded), several dormitories and many student residents, just next to the University campus. Today, Christiansbjerg has around 22,000 inhabitants, and has grown to become an important part of Aarhus. In the northernmost parts of Chrisitansbjerg, beyond the ring road of Ring 2 and west of Randersvej, there is a large business park comprising many educational institutions, sports facilities and businesses. Only a few residential apartment buildings are here. The business park extends well into the borough of Skejby, all the way to the old village of Skejby itself and is known as Business Park Skejby.Business Park Skejby: A map of BPS Important facilities in the Christiansbjerg part of this area includes the DR headquarters, Danmarks Medie- og Journalisth√∏jskole (Danish School of Media and Journalism) and Aarhus Tech (center for technical VET educations).DR - Danish Broadcasting Corporation C.

Around 11,000 people are living here, with many university students. With its short distance to downtown and the nature of Riis Skov and the bay, Tr√∏jborg has also attracted many non-students also. The borough works almost like an independent town-village within the city of Aarhus, having its own distinct architectural charm, shopping district and cultural life. There are about a hundred stores here, a cinema, grocery and fruit markets, plenty caf√©s, bars and restaurants and the supermarkets L√∏vbjerg and Rema 1000. The architecture of Tr√∏jborg, presents a typical Danish working-class townscape from the late 1800s to early 1900s. The area underwent a modernisation from 2001 to 2006, with wider sidewalks, reconstructions of the urban space and a few new buildings.Magistratens 2.

Marienlund and Riis Skov  Marienlund comprise the northern tip of Tr√∏jborg, near the traffic meeting point of Grenaavej, Nordre Ringgade and Dronning Magrethesvej. It is a residential area of mostly single houses with a distinct architectural design. Marienlund is also the name of a terminus for several bus lines going around and through Aarhus and it is the official gateway to the forest-park of Riis Skov. Riis Skov stretches along the coast of the bay and is a public forest- park now enclosed by the city. It is one of Aarhus' more significant landmarks and is popular with residents (and tourists) and has been for hundreds of years. Along the coast, there is a small beach and a sea bath - open during the summer months -, separated from the woods by the regional rail line. = Vorrevangen = From Vorrevangen. A residential apartment block in yellow brick (1958). Located just north of Riisvangen, Vorrevangen is also primarily a quiet residential area, but the buildings here are different. They are a mix of apartment buildings and row houses, with a few small detached family houses in between. Vorrevangen is centered on the large school of Vorrevangskolen and there is a small shopping area in the south, at the ring road of Ring 2 close to Riisvangen. = Skejby = Skejby is a former rural village, that has recently merged with the expanding city. The village of Skejby and the typical whitewashed village church is still present here, but the modern Skejby neighborhood extends far beyond this small settlement. = Vejlby = Vejlby is another former village, that has merged with the expanding city. The whitewashed village church and adjoining grave yard is still present and the surrounding area still has a little bit of the former village charm, even though the local \\"kro\\" (Danish inn) closed in the 2000s. In Denmark, village inns traditionally functioned as local centers for larger gatherings and celebrations and an opportunity for visitors and travelers to stay overnight. In the late 20th century the neighbourhood of Vejlby was merged with Risskov, to administratively form the Vejlby-Risskov district, all part of Aarhus N. = Risskov = A rather large neighborhood on the seaside slopes north of the urban forest of Riis Skov. With a splendid view of the Bay of Aarhus and easy access to the beach, this area comprise many large mansions and detached houses and it has a history as an affluent neighborhood. In the late 20th century, Risskov was administratively merged with Vejlby to form the Vejlby- Risskov district.  Transportation  Both ring roads of Ring 1 and Ring 2 pass through Aarhus N. Two of the city's six intercity motorways - Gren√•vej and Randersvej - radiates from the central parts of Aarhus through the district. Aarhus light rail at Ring 2 and the water tower = Bus = Aarhus N is served by several bus lines, both intra- and intercity. There are no manned bus terminals in Aarhus N, but some buses terminate at smaller hubs. = Light Rail = In December 2017, the city's first light rail line opened, connecting the Aarhus Central Station with The New University Hospital (DNU) in Skejby.

Appointed by Director of Communications Peter Mandelson, he was strategy and polling adviser to the Labour Party in the general elections of 1987, 1992, 1997, 2001 and 2005.\\"Labour peer Philip Gould has died aged 61\\", BBC News, 7 November 2011. Involved in 'modernising' the party's image, Gould was particularly connected with Tony Blair and New Labour. Early life and education Gould grew up in Woking, where his father was a headmaster, but failed his 11-plus and went to a secondary modern school. Leaving school with only one O-level, he went on to study at East London College, based in Toynbee Hall, where he gained four A-levels. He subsequently won a place at the University of Sussex in 1971 to study politics, graduating in 1974. Gould went to the London School of Economics to study for an MSc in the history of political thought, where he was taught by the political scientist Michael Oakeshott. Later he returned to the LSE to teach a course in Modern Campaigning Politics. Career After a career in advertising, and with the success of his wife Gail Rebuck (later CEO of Random House UK), whom he had met at Sussex, Gould founded his own polling and strategy company, Philip Gould Associates, in 1985. Appointed by Mandelson, Gould recruited the Shadow Communications Agency, a team of communication volunteers, who created Labour's unsuccessful 1987 election campaign. This led to his position of influence within the Labour Party under Neil Kinnock and Tony Blair. Gould was the author of a leaked memo which, in 2000, described the New Labour brand as being contaminated. On 7 June 2004 he was created a life peer taking the title Baron Gould of Brookwood, of Brookwood in the County of Surrey.Introduction in the House of Lords House of Lords minutes of proceedings, 19 July 2004 In 2007, he assumed a non-executive director role at Freud Communications,Philip Gould takes Freuds position, PR Week, 17 January 2007, by Hannah Marriott. which is the firm of Blair's former diary secretary, Kate Garvey.

He ran in the Cypress electoral district, that was previously held by former Premier Harry Strom. Hyland won the district, picking it up for his party by winning a closely contested election defeating Social Credit candidate Barry Bernhardt\\" and two other candidates.

Beef broth may be substituted for the anchovy broth. It is served with a sauce made from sesame oil, ganjang and small amounts of chili pepper powder and scallions. Thinly sliced jidan (ÏßÄÎã®, fried egg), gim (laver) and zucchini are added on top of the dish as garnishes. Janchiguksu at Doosan Encyclopedia Janchi-guksu have various garnishs with noodles. The word \\"Janchi\\" means \\"feast\\" in Korean. The name came from where someone can taste it on a feast day such as marriage or hoegabyeon.  History  The name derives from the Korean word janchi (ÏûîÏπò, literally \\"feast\\" or \\"banquet\\"), because the noodle dish has been eaten for special occasions like wedding feasts, birthday parties, or hwangap (60th birthday celebration) throughout Korea. The word guksu means \\"noodles\\" in Korean, and noodles symbolise longevity - in life, in a marriage. There are records of guksu dating back to the Goryeo period.

The two railroad bores were constructed for different purposes at different times, while the two highway bores were constructed concurrently, all with the goal of bypassing a sharp bend in the river. Currently, two of the bores carry Interstate 80, while the other two bores carry Union Pacific Railroad's Overland Route and Central Corridor. Bridges over the Humboldt River are adjacent to both portals of three tubes, including the two freeway bores and one of the railroad bores. History The first bore was constructed by the Southern Pacific Railroad in 1903 as part of a straightening of the First Transcontinental Railroad, prior to this time the railroad followed the curved river through the canyon. The second tunnel was constructed by the Western Pacific Railroad for the Feather River Route. The modern Union Pacific Railroad, which acquired both of these railroad companies, has combined the former competing lines into a dual-track directional running main for uninterrupted traffic. The former Southern Pacific bore crosses the Humboldt river at each portal, similar to the freeway bores, while the former Western Pacific bore does not cross the river at the tunnel portals. U.S. Route 40 was originally routed on the old railroad grade through the canyon. With the planned construction of Interstate 80 through the area, a third and fourth bore was constructed to accommodate the expected traffic increase and higher traffic speed; these were completed and opened on September 25, 1975. In addition to these larger tunnels, both railroad grades feature several smaller tunnels as the railroad follows Carlin Canyon and downstream Palisade canyon of the Humboldt River. The railroad bridges and tunnels near Carlin have made news on a few occasions. In 1908, a rock slide nearly caused the Southern Pacific tunnel to collapse resulting in a massive effort to save the rail line. In 1939, the City of San Francisco passenger train derailed on one of the Humboldt river bridges, killing 24 and injuring 121. The incident was ruled sabotage, but remains unsolved. In 2008, a train derailment at a smaller tunnel west of Carlin led to the collapse of one of the Humboldt River bridges. This bridge collapse resulted in nationwide rail traffic delays.

It is a subspecies of the silvereye that occurs in Western Australia and South Australia. It is sometimes called the white-eye or greenie. Aboriginal names for the bird include jule-we-de-lung or julwidilang from the Perth area and poang from the Pallinup River. Distribution and habitat The western silvereye is found in Southwest Australia with its range extending northwards to the vicinity of Shark Bay and Carnarvon, and rarely in winter as far as Point Cloates and the De Grey River. In the south its range extends eastwards along the south coast of Western Australia into South Australia at the head of the Great Australian Bight. It also occurs on many offshore islands, including the Houtman Abrolhos and the Archipelago of the Recherche. Habitats used by the bird include both wet and dry sclerophyll forest, temperate eucalypt woodland, mallee woodland and shrubland, and mangroves, as well as areas of and around human habitation. Description The upperparts are entirely bright olive-green, with the wings and tail feathers grey, edged with green. The throat and undertail coverts are yellow-green, with the rest of the underparts grey. Circlets of small white feathers surround the eyes. Males are brighter yellow on the throat than females. The birds are 10‚Äì13 cm in length and weigh about 10 g.Serventy & Whittell (1976).Schodde & Mason (1999). They give a variety of high-pitched calls, with the distinctive and constantly uttered contact call a thin ‚Äòpsee‚Äô. Taxonomy and nomenclature The western silvereye is the only green-backed form of the silvereye found in Australia, the other subspecies there having grey backs. According to Serventy and Whittell, who treat it as a full species, the bird also lacks the pre-nuptial moult which characterise the eastern Australian populations of the species. Because of such differences, the western silvereye has often been considered a full species. However, Schodde and Mason retain it in lateralis because, with a similar niche and voice, it replaces the eastern forms of the species in south-west Australia; because it is connected by a zone of intergradation with Z. l. pinarochrous in South Australia; and because mtDNA data links chloronotus with pinarochrous eastwards to western Victoria where the latter intergrades with Z. l. westernensis, showing that the various forms meeting in south-eastern Australia are linked by broad zones of morphological intergradation. The specific (or subspecific) name gouldi Bonaparte, 1850, was previously applied to the bird on the mistaken presumption that chloronotus Gould, 1841 was a junior secondary homonym of Dicaeum chloronothos Viellot, 1817 in Zosterops. Thus chloronotus is the senior synonym and has priority. Behaviour Of the general behaviour of the western silvereye, Serventy and Whittell say: > ‚ÄùThis is perhaps the commonest small bird in the Perth area and over much of > the South-West. After the nesting season, by January, the birds gather into > foraging flocks, which are noisily on the move until the pairs separate out > again next spring. In the city and suburbs they play the role of the Sparrow > (Passer domesticus) in the eastern States, or the tits (Parus) in Europe, > visiting gardens, shrubberies and even the backyard fowl-run.‚Äù =Breeding= The western silvereye usually builds a suspended cup-shaped nest of grasses in a shrub or tree. The grasses are bound with spider web and the inner cup lined with finer grasses, wool or horsehair. The cup is about 5 cm across and 2‚Äì3 cm deep. Clutch size is two or three, sometimes four, pale blue eggs. Both parents incubate the eggs for a period of 10‚Äì13 days, with the young birds leaving the nest about 12 days after hatching. Breeding takes place mainly in the wetter, coastal part of the range from September to January, with the birds forming large flocks and moving further afield once breeding has ceased. When breeding conditions are good, pairs can produce and raise up to four broods in a season. =Feeding= Nectar from Marri flowers is a favoured food Western silvereyes are omnivorous; they eat small insects as well as a wide variety of fruits and nectar. They form mixed-species foraging flocks with several other birds, especially weebills, western gerygones, western, inland and yellow-rumped thornbills, grey fantails and golden whistlers.Higgins et al. (2006). In summer when their natural food supplies are scarce, they flock to vineyards and orchards and damage grapes and other soft fruits. When Marri trees are flowering and producing large amounts of nectar in summer, damage to fruit is usually minimal. Relationship with humans In Western Australia, the western silvereye is a declared pest of agriculture under the provisions of the Agriculture and Related Resources Protection Act 1976, administered by the Western Australian Department of Agriculture and Food.Dept of Environment and Conservation, WA (2007).

It describes the way the U.S. government has modified the way important economic measures are calculated with the purpose of giving a better impression of economic development. This is a clear reference, in a sarcastic way, to Pollyanna's proverbial optimism. Williams and other economic analysts, such as Kevin P. Phillips, argue that such manipulations distort the perception of electors and economic factors and have ill effects on political and investment decisions. United Kingdom Concern about the manipulation of statistics also exists in the United Kingdom. For example, inflation in the price of certain essentials (such as food and fuel) is far higher than that of the published consumer price index. The more reasonable answer to this seeming conundrum is that food and fuel make up a relatively small proportion of overall average household expenditure (about 10% for food consumed at home, 5% for home fuel, 5% for car fuel). This is because although these make up a larger proportion of expenditure in a typical week, inflation consumption weights account for all expenditure, even those large items purchased only infrequently (e.g. motor vehicles, furniture, electronics, clothes, etc.) but that when purchased are very large commitments. Prices of these goods have risen much less quickly or have, in some cases, fallen.

It passes through Cave Rock, a volcanic stone formation. To the Washoe Indian Tribe, Cave Rock (Washo: De ek Wadapush ) is considered a sacred place and the tribe has placed restrictions on recreational activities in the vicinity of the tunnel. Description The tunnels carry U.S. Route 50 through Cave Rock, a mountain along the eastern shore of Lake Tahoe. There are numerous small caves adjacent to the south portal of both tunnels which give the rock its name. The tunnel is located between the towns of Zephyr Cove and Glenbrook along the US 50 corridor. This portion of US 50 is a National Scenic Byway, part of the Lake Tahoe - Eastshore Drive. The westbound bore is long and features exposed rock; the eastbound bore features a concrete liner and is long. The tunnels are an elevation of at approximately , about above the level of the lake. History The tunnel dates back to the Lincoln Highway. Originally the Lincoln Highway was routed along a single lane hanging bridge and rock wall built in 1863. Recognizing the inadequacy of the single lane road, efforts began to improve capacity on the primary road to Lake Tahoe. The first bore was constructed in 1931, as part of a reconstruction of a section of the Lincoln Highway. Concerned about damaging Cave Rock, the project managers employed key people from the recently completed Zion-Mt. Carmel Tunnel in what is now Zion National Park in Utah. The first traffic began flowing through the bore in mid-September of that year. Construction on the second bore began in 1957, when US 50 was widened to four lanes, at a cost of just over $450,000 (equivalent to $ million today). Coincidentally, both bores were constructed by Utah-based construction companies. After a 2015 rockslide, and observations of more unstable rock in the area, the Nevada Department of Transportation initiated a safety improvement and retrofit project in 2016. The project retrofitted parts of the original 1931 bore with a concrete liner and extended the tunnel by on its north end by constructing a rock fall shelter to protect the roadway from falling rocks. The retrofit included new lighting for both tunnels, and variable message signs on the approaches designed to activate upon the presence of bicyclists or ice inside the tunnel. =Tribal relations= What remains of the single lane hanging bridge that predated the Cave Rock tunnel The Cave Rock area is considered sacred by the Washoe tribe. The Washoe tribal leaders were not consulted about the construction of either bore, and were upset about the desecration of their tribal lands. Within the last decade, the Washoe Tribe has had a larger influence on Cave Rock and its historic preservation. In 2007, the Federal Government ruled on a precedent- setting case that has restricted activities around the tunnel, such as rock climbing.

At least 261 people died as a result of the earthquake, and more than 4,000 were injured. Most of the casualties occurred in Bachu county. Almost 10,000 homes were levelled by the earthquake. A further 5 people were killed in powerful aftershocks which occurred on 26 February 2003. Tectonic setting Seismic activity is common in the Bachu and the surrounding area. It occurs as a result of movement on fault systems that bound the Tien Shan mountain belt. The Tien Shan is actively evolving, as a result of far-field stresses associated with the collision of India and Eurasia. According to the moment tensor solution, the earthquake occurred on a thrust fault that dips 6¬∞ to the north, and strikes approximately east‚Äìwest. Such a gentle dip angle implies that the earthquake may have occurred on or just above the basal detachment of the neighbouring fold-thrust belts.

Location and features The Western Corridor is the area from Brisbane's south west suburbs towards the city of Ipswich. For many years the corridor has experienced significant population growth with the development of the suburb of Springfield and the resultante extension of the Centenary Highway and the upgrade to the Ipswich Motorway. The scheme involved the construction of three advanced water treatment plants constructed at Bundamba, Luggage Point and Gibson Island, which draw water from six existing wastewater treatment plants in the region to produce up to of purified recycled water daily. The water is distributed via a network of pipelines measuring more than in length. Construction began on the Recycled Water Project in 2006 and completed in late 2008. 408 million of funding was provided by the Australian Government via its Water Smart Australia Program. In Stage 1 of the project the scheme has provided an alternative water source for Swanbank Power Station and both Tarong Power Station and Tarong North Power Station. Supplies to Swanbank started in 2007 and supplies to Tarong and Tarong North started in June 2008. The system has the capacity to provide water to other industrial users, agricultural users and to supplement drinking water supplies in Wivenhoe Dam. Testing of the pipeline to Wivenhoe Dam has been conducted, however in November 2008, Premier Anna Bligh declared that recycled water will not enter the dam unless levels drop to below 40%.

Early years and family Mohammed Hadid was born into a rich Mosulite family\\"Minwathaiq al-hizbal-shuyui, kitabatal al-rafiq Al-Shabibi\\", Al-Rafiq Al-Shabibi, 1974 at the beginning of the 20th century. He married Wajeeha Sabonji, with whom he had three children; Haithem, the writer and accountant, Foulath, and the noted architect Zaha Hadid. Years of study Hadid attended the London School of Economics between 1928 and 1931, and achieved a degree in Economics. It was there that he is said to have been influenced by the ideas of Professor Harold Laski, a \\"widely known socialist and agnostic\\". He was also influenced by the works of Sidney Webb, Hugh Dalton, John Maynard Keynes and other economists and socialists whose Fabian ideas held the promise for a new social order to be constructed in the aftermath of the Ottoman Empire. Politics In 1931, Hadid returned to Baghdad and joined the Iraqi Ministry of Finance. More importantly, he became a founding member of the politically progressive Ahali group which embraced the ideals of Britain's Labour Party and attracted other leading personalities such as , , and Hikmat Sulayman. Ahali group In 1936, the Ahali group was involved in a coup d'√©tat that was led by army general Bakr Sidqi. When Sidqi sought dictatorial power at the expense of the group's plans for public welfare and reform, the group resigned en bloc in 1937. In 1946, Hadid became Vice-President of the National Democratic Party. The party, essentially the social democratic wing of the Ahali group, championed agrarian reform, workers' rights and state control of Iraq's nascent oil industry. International voice While representing Mosul in the Chamber of Deputies, Hadid became a leading member of the Council of the Federation of Iraqi Industries. British influence was still immense in Iraq. During visits to the United Kingdom he supplied the press with calls for genuine parliamentary Iraqi democracy. He also opposed Iraqi participation in the pro-Western defence organisation known as the Baghdad Pact. In 1956, when Britain joined France and Israel in attacking Suez, he spearheaded the Front of National Union through which Iraq's political parties united in demanding \\"the combating of imperialist encroachments\\". Another coup Following a 1958 coup, Hadid became Minister of Finance in the government formed by the leading rebel, Brigadier Abd al-Karim QasimHistorical Dictionary of Iraq - Beth K. Dougherty, who became Prime Minister and Minister of Defence. As Minister of Finance, Hadid used credit loans from the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe to foster industry and pay for ambitious schemes to alleviate the suffering of the Iraqi masses. He served in that capacity until 1960. In 1963, another coup put the Ba'ath Party briefly into power, and Hadid was put on trial, interned and deprived of his assets.

The sex is an inherent part of the story, character growth, and relationship development, and could not be removed without damaging the storyline. History The subgenre got its start in E-publishing/ small press. High volume sales showed New York publishers there was an untapped market for erotic romance that they could fill and since 2005 they have incorporated new imprints to meet the demand of readers, of which is difficult to verify as publishers tend to lump erotic romance in with established categories such as historicals, contemporaries, paranormals and other subgenres. interspecies Reviewers Focus of novels Erotic romance novels have romance as the main focus of the plot line, and they are characterized by strong, often explicit, sexual content. The books can contain elements of any of the other romance subgenres, such as paranormal elements, chick lit, hen lit, historical fiction, etc. In fact, many erotic romance novels are often categorized by one of the categories already defined in the industry. Erotic romance novels take the reader beyond the bedroom door where more traditional romance does not breach that barrier. The sex scenes, while explicit, are there for the purpose of character development. Erotic romance is not classed as pornography. Works of pornography consist of sexual acts without a plot line. Erotic romance however includes well-developed characters and at least one primary plot with the possibility of subplots. The primary and/or subplots can stand alone without the explicit sex, but the characterizations in the story will suffer dramatically if the sexual content is removed. Guidelines for authors Erotic romance writers generally have more flexibility in pushing the envelope of erotic romance than authors for traditional print publishers, although this has changed dramatically since 2005 when NY publishers began to explore the subgenre with lines such as Aphrodisa, Avon Red and others. With electronic publishing the writer has even greater leeway in most instances to write on subjects that in the past have been taboo, such as BDSM, gay lit and other topics.

The firm's original factory was located at 2-22 Britannia Row, Islington, London but the factory was bombed during World War II. In August 1946 the company reopened under new management in Plumbe Street Burnley. Also after World War II, Johillco's chief figure designer Wilfred Cherrington in conjunction with a Mr Leaver started his own company called Cherilea. In their book The Art of the Toy Soldier, the authors note that due to the cheapness of the figures and the individuality of their poses, Johillco figures were found more in working-class homes than the expensive Britains that came in boxes of rigid identical poses. The authors also noted the company probably used a variety of sculptors leading to various grades of quality of Johillco figures, that the authors call \\"the good, the bad, and the ugly\\".Ehrlich, Burtt R & Kurtz, Henry I The Art of the Toy Soldier 1990 Abbeville Press In addition to toy soldiers and cowboys and Indians, Johillco made many figures of knights and a movie tie-in set of figures from MGM's Quo Vadis (1951 film) as well as spacemen. Johillco was slow to realise the effect of production in plastic. From 1956 they began making plastic figures in their hollowcast moulds under the name of Hilco but the company ceased in the early 1960s.

As a new priest he had built a sports arena and a theater to provide a place for adolescents to engage in sport activities and to act. His beatification cause started under Pope Pius XII in 1946 and he was titled as a Servant of God while Pope Paul VI later titled him as Venerable in 1970 upon the confirmation of his heroic virtue; Pope John Paul II beatified the late priest on 29 March 1987 in Saint Peter's Square. Life Manuel Domingo y Sol was born on 1 April 1836 in Tortosa as the last of twelve children and was baptized in the same month at some point. In 1851 he commenced his studies at Tortosa for the priesthood and was later ordained as such on 2 June 1860; he celebrated his first Mass on 7 June at the church of Saint Blai. The Bishop of Tortosa Benet Vilamitjana i Vila - in 1862 - requested he go to the Valencia college for further studies and in 1865 he obtained a licentiate in theology. He became a religious education teacher in 1864 and a professor at his old seminary in 1865. On 7 March 1862 he was made a pastor of La Aldea and in 1863 sent to the parish of Santiago de Tortosa. On one cold day in February 1873 he met the seminarian Ram√≥n Valero who could not continue his studies because his Tortosa seminary was destroyed during the 1868 revolution. This touched Sol who - in September 1873 - opened \\"Saint Joseph's House\\" for seminarians and on 11 April 1879 opened the \\"College of Saint Joseph for Ecclesiastical Vocations\\". He became firm in the need for a college in Rome to cater to Spanish seminarians and this idea would later come to fruition after he met Rafael Merry del Val in Rome at Piazza Navona; the latter decided to aid Sol in his mission. Sol founded the Pontifical Spanish College in Rome on 1 April 1892 and he soon lodged the first eleven seminarians at Via Giulia as the first students for that college. At the time there were some in the Spanish episcopate who were hostile to the idea and tried to stop it. It was their view that Spanish students should train at Spanish universities - in particular at Salamanca - and believed the students would become too \\"Romanized\\" as a result. Pope Leo XIII welcomed Sol's efforts and ended up finding a home himself for the students and issued a grant on 25 October 1893 in the letter \\"Non medicori cura\\" for them to live at the usufruct of Palazzo Altemps near the Piazza Navona. The college was granted the honor of being \\"pontifical\\" during the pontificate of Pope Pius X due to the now Cardinal del Val's intervention. Sol founded a religious order - the Diocesan Labour Priests of the Sacred Heart of Jesus - on 29 January 1883 and it received diocesan approval on 1 January 1886 and the papal decree of praise from Leo XIII on 1 August 1898. Sol died in 1909. His order received papal approval from Pope Pius XI after his death on 19 March 1927 and it now operates in states such as Portugal and the Democratic Republic of Congo. Beatification Tomb. The beatification process opened in Tortosa that opened on 13 November 1930 in an informative process that closed sometime later while the formal introduction to the cause came under Pope Pius XII on 12 July 1946 in which he was titled as a Servant of God; the confirmation of his heroic virtue allowed for Pope Paul VI to name him as Venerable on 4 May 1970. The process for a miracle opened in Caracas and closed in 1976. The miracle in question involved an individual's complete and lasting cure from lung cancer in 1972; a medical board approved this miracle on 5 March 1986 as did theologians on 27 June 1986 and the Congregation for the Causes of Saints on 21 October 1986. Pope John Paul II approved this miracle on 10 November 1986 and later beatified Sol in Saint Peter's Square on 29 March 1987. The current postulator for this cause is the Rev. Santiago Luis de Vega Alonso.

The book follows Genghis' completion of the consolidation of the disparate Mongol tribes and subsequent campaigns against the Western Xia and Jin empires. Plot summary Under the name Genghis, the protagonist unites the Mongol tribes, finally defeating the last alliance against his rule. After the killing of the Khan of the alliance, the defeated shaman decides to tie his fate to that of the new Mongol nation. Genghis orders all of the tribes to assemble the following summer in the pastures around the Black Mountain. The following summer sees the tribes gathered, waiting for Genghis to lead them where he will. They are anxious to be off, but he is determined to wait for the Khan of the Uighur to show up with the five thousand soldiers he wishes to have. While stuck in one place, the new Nation becomes impatient and tempers flare. In one incident, Genghis' brother Khasar is forced to defend his honour against the sons of a lesser Khan. He is helped by the young Tsubodai, who is rewarded later in the book. When his brother, Temuge, tries to intervene, he is forced to his knees. Genghis shows up on the scene, and tries to sort out the situation. Almost everyone has their honour satisfied, except for Temuge, who complains that he was made to kneel. Genghis uses his sword to cut the Khan's thighs, so he cannot stand in return. Close to the end of the summer, the Uighurs arrive. Their Khan submits privately to Genghis, which is taken as even more binding than the public oaths the entire Mongol nation takes under a ceremony presided over by the shaman. As the price for this support, Genghis promises the Khan of the Uighars that he will march against the Xia, and the Uighars will receive the assorted libraries of the conquered people. As well as military support, Genghis negotiates that his shaman and his brother Temuge be taught to read and write. The entire Mongol nation then begins to march southwards, to take the kingdom of the Xia. Facing them is the arduous crossing of the Gobi desert. Having crossed the desert the Mongol hordes attempt to take the kingdom of Xi Xia, the Mongols inexperience in siege craft shows when they are held at bay by the walls of Xi Xia, the division between the kingdom of Xi Xia and the Chin empire is also highlighted at this time. Eventually the Xia kingdom capitulates and Genghis wins a princess of the city as his bride as well as many other spoils of war. From this point on, there is tension between Borte (Genghis' first wife) and Genghis' second wife. Also highlighted in this book is Genghis' estrangement from his eldest son Jochi (who's legitimacy Genghis doubts) and the strife within Genghis' family that this estrangement causes. Khasar and Temuge are also featured greatly in this book as they take a trip with a captured Xi Xia officer down the Yellow River to a Chin city to find masons to help them break city walls. On their adventures they come across the leader of the Blue Tong (a criminal fraternity), who helps Ghengis' brothers in exchange for a promise that he will be leader of his city after it is conquered by the Mongols. Another character of note introduced in this book is Kokchu, a shaman who smells of blood and is very self-serving. He gains Genghis' trust and starts to teach Temuge the ways of a Shaman. During the course of Temuge's lessons, he becomes addicted to Opium, which Kokchu provides for him. Historical Accuracy The source material for the book is The Secret History of the Mongols. As with the Emperor series before it, Iggulden sometimes strays from historical sources for the purpose of storytelling.

Some of these behaviors are unique to certain species, but to be 'species-typical,' they do not have to be unique‚Äîthey simply have to be characteristic of that species. To understand the importance of species- typical behavior, think about an animal that looks exactly like a dog, but meows, refuses to play fetch, and climbs trees. It's not surprising that humans would find this animal confusing; we expect an animal that looks a certain way to act a certain way, and we associate those behaviors with that animal (e.g. we associate the practice of meowing with cats). Neuroscience Species-typical behaviors are almost always a product of nervous systems, meaning that they're created and influenced by species' genetic code and social and natural environment; this implies that they are strongly influenced by evolution. The phenomenon of the breast crawl is a classic example of this: the vast majority of human newborns, when placed on a reclined mother's abdomen, will find and begin to suckle on one of the mother's breasts without any assistance. =Brain structures= Such species-typical behaviors can be tied to certain structures of the brain. To prove this point, Murphy, MacLean, and Hamilton (1981) gave hamsters brain lesions at birth, which destroy certain brain structures. They discovered that, while hamsters still expressed species-typical behavior without a brain structure called a neocortex, they lost much of their species-typical play and maternal behaviors when deprived of brain structures called midline limbic convolutions. Likewise, if squirrel monkeys lose the medial segment of a brain structure called the globus pallidus, their ability to engage in certain sexual behavior (e.g. thigh- spreading, groin-thrusting) is either eliminated or impaired. Lesions aren't the only way to discover the role of a structure in species-typical behavior; scientists also use stimulation. In a 1957 experiment, physiologist Walter Hess used an electrode to stimulate a certain part of a resting cat's brainstem; immediately after the stimulation, the cat stood up and arched its back with erect hair‚Äîa species-typical behavior in which cats engage when frightened. The behavior lasted as long as the stimulation lasted, and ended as soon as the stimulation ended. Later experiments revealed that even if the same part of the brain is stimulated with the same amount of energy for the same period of time, the intensity of the elicited behavior changes depending on the context. In 1973, behavioral physiologist Erich von Holst attached an electrode to one part of a chicken's brainstem, and recorded the (admittedly somewhat subjective) data. When briefly stimulated without any unusual environmental factors, the chicken was restless. When briefly stimulated in the presence of a human fist, the chicken reacted with a slightly threatening posture, and in the presence of a weasel, the chicken took a very threatening pose, with feathers bristling. In short, the brainstem elicits species-typical behavior that is appropriate to the surrounding environment. =Hormones and chemicals= Oftentimes the presence or density of certain chemical receptors on cranial structures like the brainstem determine their importance in one species-typical behavior or another. Consider voles. prairie voles are monogamous; they also have a high density of oxytocin receptors (OTRs) in a brain structure called the nucleus accumbens. Non-monogamous meadow voles, on the other hand, do not. Likewise, monogamous pine voles have a high-density of OTRs; non-monogamous meadow voles do not. The way in which hormones alter these receptors is an important behavioral regulator. Consider the ways in which gonads affect OTRs in different rodents. In female rats, gonadal estrogen increases the level of OTR binding and, when the ovarian cycle maximizes the amount of estrogen in the bloodstream, causes OTRs to appear in ventrolateral regions of the structure called the ventromedial nucleus. This, in turn, increases the likelihood that a female rat will engage in certain species-typical sexual activity by increasing her sexual receptivity. But the effect of this regulatory mechanism differs between species; though a gonadectomy would decrease (and gonadal steroids would increase) sexual receptivity in the female rat, these things would have the opposite impacts on female mice. =Instinct and experience= This threatening pose, illustrated here by Charles Darwin, is common among cats, but they do not learn it from one another. Instead, the perception of a certain threat activates a neural pathway with which the cat was born; the pathway causes the cat to react by arching its back, baring its teeth, and hissing. But this pre-programmed response can be altered by experience. For example, if the posture fails to deter certain threats, the cat may no longer use it in response to them. While some species-typical behavior is learned from parents, it's also sometimes the product of a fixed action pattern, also known as an innate releasing mechanism (IRM). In these instances, a neural network is 'programmed' to create a hard- wired, instinctive behavior in response to an external stimulus. When a blind child hears news that makes her happy, she's likely to smile in response; she never had to be taught to smile, and she never learned this behavior by seeing others do it. Similarly, when kittens are shown a picture of a cat in a threatening posture, most of them arch their backs, bear their teeth, and sometimes even hiss, even though they've never seen another cat do this. Many IRMs can be explained by the theory of evolution‚Äîif an adaptive behavior helps a species survive long enough to be fruitful and multiply (such as a cat hissing in order to discourage an attack from another creature), the genes that coded for those brain circuits are more likely to be passed on. A heavily studied example of a fixed action pattern is the feeding behavior of the Helisoma trivolvis (pulmonata), a type of snail. A study has shown that the intricate connections within the buccal ganglia (see nervous system of gastropods) form a central system whereby sensory information stimulates feeding in the helisoma. More specifically, a unique system of communication between three classes of neurons in the buccal ganglia are responsible for forming the neural network that influences feeding. A species-typical behavior can be altered by experience, as shown by experiments on Aplysia californica, a sea snail. When its gills are stimulated in a novel manner, it withdraws them into its shell for the sake of protection. This is a species-typical behavior. But after a stimuli that was once novel (e.g. a weak jet of water) has been applied repeatedly to the gills, aplysia no longer withdraws them. It has gone through habituation, a process by which the response to a stimulus becomes weaker with more exposure. This occurs because of changes in the nervous system. Neurons communicate with one another at synapses, which consist of the tip of the communicating cell (the presynpatic membrane), the tip of the receiving cell (the postsynaptic membrane), and the space in between the two (the synaptic cleft). When the presynaptic membrane is stimulated by the influx of calcium ions, it releases a chemical called a neurotransmitter, which travels over the synaptic cleft in order to bind to the postsynaptic membrane and thereby stimulate the receiving cell. During habituation, fewer calcium ions are brought into the presynaptic membrane, meaning less neurotransmitter is released, meaning that the stimulation of the receiving cell is not as strong, meaning that the action that it is supposed to stimulate will be weaker. Likewise, the number of synapses related to a certain behavior decreases as a creature habituates, also resulting in weaker reactions. And the structure of the synapse itself can be altered in any number of ways that weaken communication (e.g. decreased number of neurotransmitter receptors on the postsynaptic membrane). It is because of these processes that the species-typical behavior of aplysia was altered. Types =Emotional= These behaviors facilitate interaction between members of the same species and are central to a species' connection to the surrounding world. Think about this from your perspective. Humans are able to feel the same sorts of complex emotions that most other humans feel, and these emotions often elicit certain behaviors. *Remorse, a feeling of regret after having said or done something believed to be wrong, often in violation of individual or social standards of morality or ethics. People incapable of feeling remorse are often labeled as having antisocial personality disorder. To qualify the inability to feel or express remorse as a disorder underlines the degree to which it is species-typical. The behavioral manifestations of individuals who feel remorse range from person to person, but many individuals in a state of remorse show signs of sadness and disinhibition. They may decide to withdrawal from once pleasurable activities and social interactions. An individual may become more or less likely to tell others about an action that causes remorse. Some people believe that dogs are capable of feeling remorse after being scolded by an owner for engaging in a certain activity (e.g. urinating on an antique Persian rug that had been bought for $30,000). *Pride, a feeling of satisfied accomplishment, and/or hubris and self-importance. Proud people tend to show a small smile, tilt their heads back, and even place their hands on their hips and improve posture. They also regularly choose to share their accomplishments with others. *Embarrassment, a state of internal discomfort following a thought or action. Behavioral manifestations of embarrassment are similar to those of remorse. They often include the desire to retreat from socially intense situations where other people may remember an embarrassing incident. When alone, too, an embarrassed individual may try to avoid recollection of the incident due to feelings of shame it causes. Embarrassed individuals may also show signs of blushing due to embarrassment. =Feeding= These behaviors facilitate survival. Different species are physiologically adapted to consume different foods that must be acquired in different ways, and the manner in which they feed must correspond to these unique characteristics. *Rodents share common species-typical feeding behaviors (also known as order-typical, since all these creatures are members of the same order, rodentia. For example, certain types of beavers, squirrels, rats, guinea pigs, hamsters, and prairie dogs all locate food by sniffing for it, grasp for food with their mouths, sit on their hindquarters to eat, and grasp/manipulate the food with their hands. But they each also have more unique feeding behaviors. For example, beavers do grasp for food with their mouths, but sometimes they use a single paw instead. And many of the rodents manipulate the food with their digits in unique ways. *A woodpecker consumes insects that can frequently be found inside trees. To access these insects, it uses a jack-hammer like motion to drill into tree wood with its beak. It then reaches in and grabs the insects with its beak. *A heron eats aquatic creatures. In order to catch them, it lurks in the water, waits until it senses an animal in the water nearby, and then strikes with its beak. =Learning/conditioning= Species with complex nervous systems (esp. mammals), in addition to acting based on instinct and basic sensory stimuli, need to learn how to engage in certain activities. Because of the ways in which their nervous systems develop, they are frequently adept at learning certain behaviors at specific times in their lives. *White-crowned sparrows are particularly adept at learning songs between the ages of fifteen and fifty days. *A marsh wren can learn to sing over 150 bird songs, while the white- crowned sparrow can only learn a single song. Thus, the number of songs that can be sung varies between species of birds, due to relative limitations in their cognitive processing abilities. *As the above bullet point suggests, birds have species-specific preferences for certain songs that are rooted in their genes. If a young bird is not exposed to birdsong very early in its life, but is then suddenly exposed to a variety of different bird songs, including the one typical of its species, it tends to show a preference for that one. =Reproduction= Reproduction is an activity that takes place between members of the same species. In order to interact and reproduce successfully, the members of a species must share common behaviors. * The female fruit bat performs fellatio on a male fruit bat during copulation to increase overall copulation time. Although fellatio is a common human foreplay activity, it is less common among non-human animal species. At this point, it is unclear exactly what neurological forces motivate fruit bats to engage in fellatio during sex, although scientific researchers present hypotheses. But not all species-typical reproductive behaviors are about specific reproductive activity between two animals. * Infanticide is practiced by male hippopotami, most likely in order to improve their chances of reproductive success. They tend to commit infanticide within 50 days of post parturition, especially when water sources are scarce and dominance hierarchies are challenged. =Sensory/motor activity= Different species perceive the world in different ways. The nervous systems of species develop in concert with certain anatomical features in order to produce sensory environments common to most members of that species. *Because mantis shrimp can visually sense and process ultraviolet light, they react to it, while animals like dogs do not. *Mayflies are able to perceive certain patterns of light polarization which suggest to them that they are above water. In response, they release their eggs, since mayfly naiads (aquatic larvae) are biologically developed to live and grow in water. *Dogs have a scratch reflex, meaning that they reflexively scratch an irritated skin region without direction from the brain. A limb (usually their hind leg) is extended to the irritated part of the body; because this is a spinal reflex, a dog will do this even if spinal connection to the brain is severed. *A rat tends to groom itself using the same procedure in the same order: it sits up, licks its paws, wipes its nose and then its face with its paws, and then licks the fur on its body. =Social activity= Species interact with one another, and certain species exhibit commonly held social traits. *A panda often expresses aggressiveness by lowering its head and directing its gaze at the target of its aggression. This behavior may have developed due to the nature of the creatures that pandas tend to try to threaten‚Äîbecause they feel threatened by this form of intimidation, pandas regularly engage. * Cats, ponies, lions, baboons, and many other non-human species partake in social grooming to maintain the hygiene of another individual. Social grooming among animals can be seen as a form of conflict resolution that also builds trust among other animals who live nearby. Research has shown that grooming influences the endocrine system‚Äîit appears to be relaxing to those who participate due to the release of beta-endorphin. In addition, an increase in maternal grooming has been shown to increase the number of glucocorticoid receptors in the brains of newborn rats.

A. Meek, The Synagogue, Phaidon, 1995, p. 184 History =Community= The earliest record of a Jewish community in Canterbury dates from 1160. The community is known to have been prosperous and to have traded in corn (grain) and wool as well as banking. Despite pogroms in 1261 and 1264, the community flourished until the Edict of Expulsion, given by Edward I of England in 1290. Its presence is commemorated in the street name, Jewry Lane. A modern Jewish Community is known to have existed in Canterbury by 1720. The present building was designed by Canterbury architect, a Christian gentleman named Hezekiah Marshall, and constructed in 1846‚Äì48 to replace a 1763 building torn down to make place for the new railroad built by the South Eastern Railway Company. The cornerstone was laid by Sir Moses Montefiore in September 1847. A pair of columns with lotus capitals flank the doorway of the simple building, 40' by 27' by 30' high. The building is made of Portland cement, which gives the appearance of granite. There is a central bimah, the columns of which boast lotus-leaf capitals, and a women's balcony supported by Egyptian-style obelisks. The mikveh was described as \\"a miniature brick-faced temple set in the garden behind the synagogue\\". It is the only Egyptian Revival mikveh known to exist.Diana Muir Appelbaum, \\"Jewish Identity and Egyptian Revival Architecture\\", Journal of Jewish Identities, 2012 (5(2) p. 7.Rachel Wischnitzer, \\"Thomas U.

It is understood that regular services ceased in c.1911, with the premises eventually being sold off. =The King's School= In 1982, The King's School, CanterburyKing's School - Old Synagogue purchased the Old Synagogue, and it currently serves as the school's music recital hall. Members of the school's Jewish society gather at the Old Synagogue regularly for brief, informal Friday evening Shabbat meetings. Since purchasing the Old Synagogue, The King's School has generously allowed the small local Jewish community occasional use of the premises. In recent years, events such as Passover Seders, Sukkoth, Purim and other social activities, as well as a Jewish wedding, have been held on the grounds. In 2011, a Shabbat morning service and Torah reading was led by members of the University of Kent's Jewish Society and the university's Chabad Jewish Chaplain. Although several synagogues and churches were built in the Egyptian revival style in the early nineteenth century, only a few are known to survive, they include the Hobart Synagogue in Tasmania the Downtown Presbyterian Church, Nashville, Tennessee and the First Presbyterian Church (Sag Harbor), New York.

The notion was introduced by Birkhoff in 1944 and has proved to be a powerful generalization of the notion of direct product. Definition A subdirect product is a subalgebra (in the sense of universal algebra) A of a direct product Œ†iAi such that every induced projection (the composite pjs: A ‚Üí Aj of a projection pj: Œ†iAi ‚Üí Aj with the subalgebra inclusion s: A ‚Üí Œ†iAi) is surjective. A direct (subdirect) representation of an algebra A is a direct (subdirect) product isomorphic to A. An algebra is called subdirectly irreducible if it is not subdirectly representable by \\"simpler\\" algebras. Subdirect irreducibles are to subdirect product of algebras roughly as primes are to multiplication of integers. Examples * Any distributive lattice L is subdirectly representable as a subalgebra of a direct power of the two-element distributive lattice. This can be viewed as an algebraic formulation of the representability of L as a set of sets closed under the binary operations of union and intersection, via the interpretation of the direct power itself as a power set. In the finite case such a representation is direct (i.e. the whole direct power) if and only if L is a complemented lattice, i.e. a Boolean algebra. * The same holds for any semilattice when \\"semilattice\\" is substituted for \\"distributive lattice\\" and \\"subsemilattice\\" for \\"sublattice\\" throughout the preceding example. That is, every semilattice is representable as a subdirect power of the two-element semilattice. * The chain of natural numbers together with infinity, as a Heyting algebra, is subdirectly representable as a subalgebra of the direct product of the finite linearly ordered Heyting algebras. The situation with other Heyting algebras is treated in further detail in the article on subdirect irreducibles. * The group of integers under addition is subdirectly representable by any (necessarily infinite) family of arbitrarily large finite cyclic groups. In this representation, 0 is the sequence of identity elements of the representing groups, 1 is a sequence of generators chosen from the appropriate group, and integer addition and negation are the corresponding group operations in each group applied coordinate-wise. The representation is faithful (no two integers are represented by the same sequence) because of the size requirement, and the projections are onto because every coordinate eventually exhausts its group. * Every vector space over a given field is subdirectly representable by the one-dimensional space over that field, with the finite-dimensional spaces being directly representable in this way. (For vector spaces, as for abelian groups, direct product with finitely many factors is synonymous with direct sum with finitely many factors, whence subdirect product and subdirect sum are also synonymous for finitely many factors.) * Subdirect products are used to represent many small perfect groups in .

The open mapping theorem points to the sharp difference between holomorphy and real-differentiability. On the real line, for example, the differentiable function f(x) = x2 is not an open map, as the image of the open interval (‚àí1, 1) is the half-open interval [0, 1). The theorem for example implies that a non-constant holomorphic function cannot map an open disk onto a portion of any line embedded in the complex plane. Images of holomorphic functions can be of real dimension zero (if constant) or two (if non-constant) but never of dimension 1. Proof Black dots represent zeros of g(z). Black annuli represent poles. The boundary of the open set U is given by the dashed line. Note that all poles are exterior to the open set. The smaller red disk is B, centered at z0. Assume f : U ‚Üí C is a non-constant holomorphic function and U is a domain of the complex plane. We have to show that every point in f(U) is an interior point of f(U), i.e. that every point in f(U) has a neighborhood (open disk) which is also in f(U). Consider an arbitrary w0 in f(U). Then there exists a point z0 in U such that w0 = f(z0). Since U is open, we can find d > 0 such that the closed disk B around z0 with radius d is fully contained in U. Consider the function g(z) = f(z)‚àíw0. Note that z0 is a root of the function. We know that g(z) is not constant and holomorphic. The roots of g are isolated by the identity theorem, and by further decreasing the radius of the image disk d, we can assure that g(z) has only a single root in B (although this single root may have multiplicity greater than 1). The boundary of B is a circle and hence a compact set, on which g(z) is a positive continuous function, so the extreme value theorem guarantees the existence of a positive minimum e, that is, e is the minimum of g(z) for z on the boundary of B and e > 0. Denote by D the open disk around w0 with radius e. By Rouch√©'s theorem, the function g(z) = f(z)‚àíw0 will have the same number of roots (counted with multiplicity) in B as h(z):=f(z)‚àíw1 for any w1 in D. This is because h(z) = g(z) + (w0 \\\\- w1), and for z on the boundary of B, g(z) ‚â• e > w0 \\\\- w1. Thus, for every w1 in D, there exists at least one z1 in B such that f(z1) = w1. This means that the disk D is contained in f(B). The image of the ball B, f(B) is a subset of the image of U, f(U). Thus w0 is an interior point of f(U). Since w0 was arbitrary in f(U) we know that f(U) is open. Since U was arbitrary, the function f is open.

It describes a variety of techniques used to find moving objects, like an aircraft, and filter out unmoving ones, like hills or trees. It contrasts with the modern stationary target indication (STI) technique, which uses details of the signal to directly determine the mechanical properties of the reflecting objects and thereby find targets whether they are moving or not. Early MTI systems generally used an acoustic delay line to store a single pulse of the received signal for exactly the time between broadcasts (the pulse repetition frequency). This stored pulse will be sent to the display along with the next received pulse. The result was that the signal from any objects that did not move mixed with the stored signal and became muted out. Only signals that changed, because they moved, remained on the display. These were subject to a wide variety of noise effects that made them useful only for strong signals, generally for aircraft or ship detection. The introduction of phase-coherent klystron transmitters, as opposed to the incoherent cavity magnetron used on earlier radars, led to the introduction of a new MTI technique. In these systems, the signal was not fed directly to the display, but first fed into a phase detector. Stationary objects did not change the phase from pulse to pulse, but moving objects did. By storing the phase signal, instead of the original analog signal, or video, and comparing the stored and current signal for changes in phase, the moving targets are revealed. This technique is far more resistant to noise, and can easily be tuned to select different velocity thresholds to filter out different types of motion.Jerry C. Whitaker (2005) The Electronics Handbook, , p. 1824 Phase coherent signals also allowed for the direct measurement of velocity via the Doppler shift of a single received signal. This can be fed into a bandpass filter to filter out any part of the return signal that does not show a frequency shift, thereby directly extracting the moving targets. This became common in the 1970s and especially the 1980s. Modern radars generally perform all of these MTI techniques as part of a wider suite of signal processing being carried out by digital signal processors. MTI may be specialized in terms of the type of clutter and environment: airborne MTI (AMTI), ground MTI (GMTI), etc., or may be combined mode: stationary and moving target indication (SMTI). Operation Moving target indicator signal sampling process. The MTI radar uses low pulse repetition frequency (PRF) to avoid range ambiguities. Moving target indicator (MTI) begins with sampling two successive pulses. Sampling begins immediately after the radar transmit pulse ends. The sampling continues until the next transmit pulse begins. Sampling is repeated in the same location for the next transmit pulse, and the sample taken (at the same distance) with the first pulse is rotated 180 degrees and added to the second sample. This is called destructive interference. If an object is moving in the location corresponding to both samples, then the signal reflected from the object will survive this process because of constructive interference. If all objects are stationary, the two samples will cancel out and very little signal will remain. High-power microwave devices, like crossed-field amplifier, are not phase-stable. The phase of each transmit pulse is different from the previous and future transmit pulses. This phenomenon is called phase jitter. In order for MTI to work, the initial phase of both transmit pulses must be sampled and the 180 degree phase rotation must be adjusted to achieve signal cancellation on stationary objects. A secondary influence is that phase rotation is induced by Doppler, and that creates blind velocities. For example, an object moving at 75 m/s (170 mile/hour) will produce 180 degree phase shift each 1 millisecond at L band. :\\\\text{Doppler} = 180,000^\\\\circ/\\\\text{s} = 720\\\\left(\\\\frac{75 \\\\times 10^9}{3 \\\\times 10^8}\\\\right) = 720 \\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\text{Velocity} \\\\times \\\\text{Transmit Frequency}}{C} \\\\right) If the pulse repetition interval is 0.002s between transmit pulses, then the MTI process will produce 360^\\\\circ phase rotation. That is the same as a stationary object, which renders the system blind to objects traveling at this radial velocity. MTI requires 3 or 4 pulses to reduce the effect of blind velocities. Multi-pulse strategies use staggered pulses with irregular pulse repetition intervals to prevent signal cancellation on moving objects. The summation process is slightly different so as to accommodate the additional samples. Phase jitter, Doppler effects, and environmental influences limit MTI sub-clutter visibility Measure of Performance to about 25 dB improvement. This allows moving objects about 300 times smaller to be detected in close proximity to larger stationary objects. Pulse-Doppler signal processing is required to achieve greater sub-clutter visibility. Characteristics A target is traveling at velocity v_p at a maximum range R_\\\\text{max} with elevation angle EL and azimuth AZ in respect to a bistatic MTI radar. =Probability of detection (Pd)= The probability of detecting a given target at a given range any time the radar beam scans across it, Pd is determined by factors that include the size of the antenna and the amount of power it radiates. A large antenna radiating at high power provides the best performance. For high quality information on moving targets the Pd must be very high. =Target location accuracy= Location accuracy is a dependent on the certainty of the position of the radar, the radar-pointing accuracy, azimuth resolution, and range resolution. A long antenna or very short wavelength can provide fine azimuth resolution. Short antennas tend to have a larger azimuth error, an error that increases with range to the target because signal-to-noise ratio varies inversely with range. Location accuracy is vital to tracking performance because it prevents track corruption when there are multiple targets and makes it possible to determine which road a vehicle is on if it is moving in an area with many roads. The target location accuracy is proportional to the slant range, frequency and aperture length. =Target range resolution (high range resolution; HRR)= Target range resolution determines whether two or more targets moving in close proximity will be detected as individual targets. With higher performance radars, target range resolution‚Äîknown as high range resolution (HRR)‚Äîcan be so precise that it may be possible to recognize a specific target (i.e., one that has been seen before) and to place it in a specific class (e.g., a T-80 tank). This would allow more reliable tracking of specific vehicles or groups of vehicles, even when they are moving in dense traffic or disappear for a period due to screening. =Minimum detectable velocity (MDV)= The MDV comes from the frequency spread of the mainlobe clutter. MDV determines whether traffic will be detected. A GMTI radar must distinguish a moving target from ground clutter by using the target's Doppler signature to detect the radial component of the target's velocity vector (i.e., by measuring the component of the target's movement directly along the radar-target line). To capture most of this traffic, even when it is moving almost tangentially to the radar (i.e., perpendicular to the radar-target line), a system must have the ability to detect very slow radial velocities. As the radial component of a target's velocity approaches zero, the target will fall into the clutter or blind zone. This is calculated as: :\\\\text{MDV} = \\\\frac{\\\\lambda}{2} \\\\frac{4v_p}{B} \\\\sqrt{\\\\sin^2(AZ)\\\\sin^2(EL)^2 + \\\\cos^2(AZ)\\\\cos^2(EL)} Any target with a velocity less than this minimum (MDV) cannot be detected because there is not sufficient Doppler shift in its echo to separate it from the mainlobe clutter return. =Area search rate= The area coverage rate (measured in area per unit time) is proportional to system power and aperture size. Other factors which may be relevant include grid spacing, size of the power amplifier, module quantization, the number of beams processed and system losses. =Stand-off distance= Stand-off distance is the distance separating a radar system from the area it is covering. =Coverage area size (breadth and depth)= Coverage area size is the area that the system can keep under continuous surveillance from a specific orbit. Well known design principles cause a radar's maximum detection range to depend on the size of its antenna (radar aperture), the amount of power radiated from the antenna, and the effectiveness of its clutter cancellation mechanism. The earth's curvature and screening from terrain, foliage, and buildings cause system altitude to be another key factor determining depth of coverage. The ability to cover an area the size of an army corps commander's area of interest from a safe stand-off distance is the hallmark of an effective, advanced GMTI system. =Coverage area revisit rate= This equates to the frequency with which the radar beam passes over a given area. Frequent revisits are very important to the radar's ability to achieve track continuity and contribute to an increased probability of target detection by lessening the chance of obscuration from screening by trees, buildings, or other objects. A fast revisit rate becomes critical to providing an uncorrupted track when a target moves in dense traffic or is temporarily obscured, if only by trees along a road.

The species is known only from the mid to late Albian Toolebuc Formation, part of the rolling downs group, in the Hughenden of Central northern Queensland, Australia. History and classification Cratochelone berneyi is known only from one fossil, the holotype, specimen number \\"QM F14550\\". The specimen is composed of a grouping of disassociated post-cranial skeleton elements in a hard, fine-grained and \\"dirty-stone colored\\" sedimentary matrix. The bones include portions of the left side plastron, the shoulder girdle, and segments of a forelimb. The fossil is thought to have been recovered by F. L. Berney from outcrops of the Toolebuc Formation exposed in the Eromanga Basin. The type specimen is currently preserved in the paleontology collections housed in the Queensland Museum, in Brisbane, Australia. Cratochelone was first studied by Herber A. Longman, husband of Irene Longman, of the Queensland Museum. Longman's 1915 type description of the genus and species was published in the Memoirs of the Queensland Museum. The generic name was coined by Longman to be a contradistinction of the related Albian genus Notochelone also described from Queensland. The specific epithet berneyi is in honor of F. L. Berney who recovered and donated the specimen to the museum. Cratochelone bernedi is one of three protostegid sea turtle taxa described from the fossil record of Australia. Described in 1885 Notochelone costata is the smallest species, while the most recently described species Bouliachelys suteri, is between Notochelone and Cratochelone in size. In his type description Longman noted the incomplete nature of the fossil and hoped that more complete specimens would be found. Despite this, the type specimen remains the only known specimen of the species. Description The holotype specimen's forelimb is represented by the proximal ends of the radius, ulna and humerus. Though missing, the shaft of the humerus was similar to those found in primitive protostegid species. The wide angle of divergence between the scapular processes is similar to a number of early protostegid and cheloniids. The wide wings along the entoplastron and its lack of fusion with the surrounding bones indicates that Longman's placement of the genus is accurate. Longman noted the very large size of the bones, and estimated a complete specimen may have reached close to .

It is also known as South Saskatoon, after the CN rail siding located in the area. It is a part of the Nutana Suburban Development Area. This industrial park was established with the Grand Trunk Pacific Railway crossing the South Saskatchewan River. C.N. Industrial is bisected by Circle Drive, which directly links to all major highways entering the city, and is also connected directly to the Idylwyld Freeway, which links to downtown Saskatoon. This neighbourhood on the east side of Saskatoon is not to be confused with the Canadian National Railway (C.N.) Yards Management Area located on Chappell Drive in the Confederation SDA of Saskatoon's west side. These two sides of Saskatoon are connected with the Grand Trunk Bridge (aka CN railway bridge) and the Gordie Howe Bridge over the South Saskatchewan River. Geography CN railway tracks CN Industrial is bordered to the south by The Willows, Saskatoon, on the north by Idylwyld Drive and Avalon. Stonebridge is to the east, and Sk Hwy 219 to the west. Diefenbaker management area and the South Saskatchewan River are west of the CN Industrial area. The auto mall is a newer part of the CN Industrial area east of Portage Avenue to Clarence Avenue. There is a new interchange at Clarence Avenue and Idylwyld Drive to provide easier access to the area. The Grand Trunk Bridge (Saskatoon) or CN Bridge crosses the South Saskatchewan River between the Queen Elizabeth Power Station on the upstream (west) side and Diefenbaker Park on the downstream (east) side. The train bridge commenced construction work in 1906 with rail line service beginning on September 21, 1908. A southwest extension of Circle Drive, which opened in July 2013, passes through C.N. Industrial. Access to businesses in C.N. Industrial is facilitated via an interchange at Lorne Avenue, but the area is now split into two sections with Jasper Avenue no longer crossing Circle Drive. Economy Auto mall Some of the major employers in this area are Early Seed and Feed, Roadex Services, Ltd., and Speedway Moving & Storage. The Saskatoon Auto Mall, which opened on the east side of C.N. Industrial in the early 2000s, includes Saturn, Mini, Sherwood, Chevrolet, and BMW auto dealers, most of whom relocated to the auto mall from locations along 8th Street. In addition, retail development has occurred on the west side of Clarence Avenue south of Brand Road in the wake of development of the Stonebridge commercial hub to the east and new residential communities beyond it. The city's detachment of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police relocated to C.N. Industrial from its previous location on 8th Street East in the 2000s. As of early 2019, a hotel is under construction at Lorne Avenue and Jasper Avenue North.

The school was founded in 1873 as a coll√®ge (middle school) and became a lyc√©e (middle and high school) in 1933. It is named after King Sisowath. History Under the initiative of Fran√ßois Fontaine, the first \\"modern\\" Franco-Cambodian school was established in the year 1873. It was the French-language School of the Protectorate, in Phnom Penh. The School of the Protectorate was renamed Coll√®ge of the Protectorate in 1893 and then Coll√®ge Sisowath in 1905. The Coll√®ge prepared students for service in the French colonial administration, the judiciary and the indigenous administration. During the French Protectorate, the school was heavily dominated by Vietnamese immigrant children. In 1933, the Coll√®ge Sisowath became the Lyc√©e Preah Sisowath. The first Cambodian students graduated from the Lyc√©e Sisowath with baccalaur√©ats in 1939. Only 144 Cambodians had completed the full baccalaur√©at by 1954. The Ministry of Education took measures to use the Khmer language at all education levels including Lyc√©e Sisowath beginning in 1967. During the Khmer Republic, the school was renamed twice: first to Lyc√©e October 9 in 1970, after the date of the declaration of the republic by the Lon Nol regime, then to Phnom Daun Penh High School in 1974. Under the Pol Pot regime, the high school was closed and used as an army warehouse. The teachers, staff, and students were forced to leave the city and live in undeveloped areas, where they greatly suffered from the killings perpetrated. After the January 7, 1979, Vietnamese invasion, the government of the People's Republic of Kampuchea gradually reopened schools. The lyc√©e was officially reopened on January 21, 1980, under the name of Phnom Daun Penh High School. School personnel requested the ministry of education to change the high school name to its original name of Lyc√©e Preah Sisowath in 1993 to preserve this historic endowment. In 1996, a Franco-Khmer section was reintroduced again at the Lyc√©e Sisowath. Campus Lyc√©e Sisowath occupies a lot bordering Norodom Boulevard donated by King Sisowath in 1905. The school has eight buildings and one administration center which retains its original French-influenced appearance. There is one football field, two volleyball fields and three basketball fields.

Adams House is a historic house in Pawtucket, Rhode Island, United States. In 1983 it was added to the National Register of Historic Places (listed incorrectly as the John E. Adams House); the house's unique exterior and architecture were described in the multiple property submission as the \\"finest late Italianate dwelling still standing in Pawtucket.\\" Its design is similar to the dwellings designed by Henry Austin and features Moorish window hoods and Indian porch columns. The John F. Adams House was moved back and turned to face Allen Avenue after it was purchased by the Beacon Oil Company in 1929. This minor move was found not to make it ineligible because of the house's architectural and historical significance. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1983.  Design  The house was erected in 1867 by John F. Adams, a wealthy manufacturer of printed textiles and later mayor of Pawtucket, Rhode Island in 1898. The architect of the John F. Adams House is currently unknown, but the National Register of Historic Places's multiple property submission provides an interpretation of its design and architectural roots. The stylistic evidence suggests that the architect of the home was not local, noting the use of \\"Indian-derived columns and other Eastern details, as early as the 1840s.\\" These details were introduced in the 1840s by Henry Austin, but the work also has similar aspects to the James Knapp House that were featured in Edmund V. Gillon Jr.'s Early Illustrations and Views of American Architecture. Similarities to the Knapp house include the overall form, the pilastered cupola and Moorish windows. According to the NRHP nomination, the Providence Journal does not list the name of an architect, but notes that Nathan Crowell was the carpenter for the house. The nomination form goes as far as to suggest that Crowell may have copied the designs reprinted in Gillon's book. The design is noted as \\"characteristic of the distinctive vernacular taste of lower Connecticut.\\"  Use  The John F. Adams House originally fronted on Broadway, but it was moved after it was purchased by the Beacon Oil Company in 1929. Instead of tearing down the house to build a gas station on Broadway, the Beacon Oil Company moved the house back and turned it 90 degrees to face Allen Avenue. The designation of the property is Pawtucket Assessor's Plat 20B, lot 529. Near the John F. Adams House are the identical twin Fuller Houses.  Importance  The multiple property submission states that the John F. Adams House is the \\"finest late Italianate dwelling still standing in Pawtucket. The exotic details of its principal facade - the Moorish window hoods and Indian porch columns - are unmatched in the city and link the Adams House to a group of similar mid- nineteenth-century dwellings designed by Henry Austin and his followers in the vicinity of New Haven, Connecticut.\\" Despite having been moved, the house was still found to have met the standards for the National Register of Historic Places due to the architectural and historical significance of the property and that the move was relatively insignificant. The John F. Adams House was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1983.

It is a single-story brick structure with a flat roof and a series of towers capped by pointed roofs. It was erected as an automotive service station in 1927‚Äì28 for Arthur Normand at a time when gasoline producers competed, in part, by the shape and style of their service stations. This station is one of two stations known to survive from this period in the state. Its front facade has a dramatic presentation, with square towers topped by pyramidal roofs at the corners, and a projecting round bay in the center topped by a conical roof, with windows arrayed around the bay and on its flanks. The building is currently used as an office for Anchor Financial. Art's Auto was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1978.  Design  Art's Auto was constructed for Arthur Normand in 1927‚Äì28 on a triangular lot intersected by Main Street and Lonsdale Avenue (Rhode Island Route 122). Also intersecting are Thurston Street and Randall Street, forming a busy intersection in Pawtucket, Rhode Island. The service station is a single-story brick structure measuring by . The interior and exterior of the building are divided into two distinct sections, with the original office and sales display area measuring deep and the rear area being deep. The front division's corners are marked by four square turret-like piers with pyramidal roofs, each capped with a single over-scaled ball finial. Projecting from the center of the southwest facade is a circular tower with a ten-sided conical roof and a large ball finial. The front of the building has large display windows and a doorway on each side, comprising the majority of the facade which is topped by a false mansard roof. The rear division is devoid of architectural ornamentation, consisting of a flat metal roof to house the garage of the service station. An overhead garage door allows access for vehicles into the concrete floor service area. In 1978, the building likely used asbestos shingles for the front roofing, though they may have been removed by later renovations.  Use  Art's Auto was originally used as a gas station, but it had been abandoned and was slated for demolition after it was acquired by the Pawtucket Redevelopment Agency. In 1978, the agency recognized the building's historical nature and decided to preserve the property. At the time of its listing on the historic register, the property was in a run-down state, while the Pawtucket Redevelopment Agency was advertising it as \\"the most interesting and best preserved early 20th century service station in Rhode Island\\". The vacant property was later purchased for use by a lawyer and then by an auto dealer before being purchased by Joseph Baptista in 2000. Baptista had to survey the ground to ensure that the gas tanks had been removed. Since 2000, Baptista's mortgage finance company Anchor Financial has operated out of the location and the building has continued to retain its historic features.  Significance  Art's Auto is historically and architecturally significant as a type of novelty gas station that was constructed during the phase in which America became highly mobile and yet had not designed specific forms and marketing for automobile service stations. The building's design was intended to capture the attention of motorists and capitalize on the positive imagery of the design. Pawtucket's Art's Auto and Gilbane's Service Center buildings are both rare surviving examples of a dedicated service station displaying whimsical designs in what has been described as the second generation service stations.

In the TWS mode the radar has a possibility to acquire additional targets as well as providing an overall view of the airspace and helping maintain better situational awareness.James Constant (1981) \\"Fundamentals of Strategic Weapons: Offense and Defense Systems\\", , p. 193 Background Early airborne radar systems generally operated purely as tracking systems, with a dedicated radar operator manually \\"tuning\\" the system to locate targets in a relatively narrow field-of-view in front of the aircraft. The searching area could be moved using a variety of methods, typically phase-shifting or lobe switching on lower frequency systems that required large antennas, or by moving the radar dish on microwave frequency radars. Engagements would start with ground controllers guiding the aircraft into the general area of the target via voice commands to the pilot, and once the aircraft got into range its own radar would pick up the target for the final approach when the radar operator would provide voice commands to the pilot. There was no real distinction between seeking out a target and tracking it. Ground-based radars like the SCR-584 automated this process early in their evolution. In search mode the SCR-584 rotated its antenna through 360 degrees and any returns were plotted on a plan position indicator (PPI). This gave the operators an indication of any targets within its ~25 mile detection range and their direction relative to the radar van. When one of the returns was considered interesting, the radar was flipped to tracking mode and \\"locked-on\\". From then on it would automatically keep its antenna pointed at the target, feeding out accurate direction, altitude and range information on a B-Scope display. Operator workload was greatly reduced. Advances in electronics meant it was only a matter of time before automated radars like the SCR-584 could be reduced in size and weight enough to fit into an aircraft. These started appearing in the late 1950s and remained common until the 1980s. The introduction of semi-active radar homing missiles made the lock-on concept especially important. These missiles use the launching aircraft's own radar to \\"paint\\" the target with a radar signal, the missile listens for the signal being reflected off the target to home in on. This requires the radar to be locked on in order to provide a steady guidance signal. The drawback is that once the radar is set to tracking a single target, the operator loses information about any other targets. This is the problem that track while scan is meant to address. In traditional radar systems, the display is purely electrical; signals from the radar dish are amplified and sent directly to an oscilloscope for display. There is a one-to- one correspondence between \\"blips\\" on the display and a radio signal being received from the antenna. When the antenna is not pointed in a particular direction, the signal from any targets in that direction simply disappear. To improve the operator's ability to read the display, the oscilloscopes typically used a slowly fading phosphor as a crude form of \\"memory\\".  Track while scan  Track while scan radars became possible with the introduction of two new technologies: phased-array radars and computer memory devices. Phased- array antennas became practical with the introduction of tunable high-power coherent radio frequency oscillators in the 1960s. By shifting the phase slightly between a series of antennas, the resulting additive signal can be steered and focused electronically. Much more important to the development of TWS was the development of digital computers and their associated memories, which allowed the radar data to be remembered from scan to scan. TWS radars disconnect the display from the antenna, sending the signals to a computer instead of the display. The computer interprets the signal and develops a \\"track file\\" for anything that would have normally caused a blip. The next time the radar returns to that area, any returns are correlated with the original recording, and the track file is updated or discarded as appropriate. A second system continuously reads the data in the track files from memory, and displays this on the radar as a series of annotated icons. Unlike the straight tracking mode, TWS radars have to solve an additional problem of recognizing whether each target discrimination/detection defines a new target or belongs to already tracked targets.\\"MATLAB Simulations for Radar Systems Design (2004) \\", p. 420, With the location of targets known even when the radar antenna is not pointed at them, TWS radars can return to the same area of sky on their next scan and beam additional energy toward the target. So in spite of the radar not constantly painting the target as it would in a traditional lock-on, enough energy is sent in that direction to allow a missile to track. A phased array antenna helps here, by allowing the signal to be focused on the target when the antenna is in that direction, without it having to be pointed directly at the target. This means that the target can be painted for a longer period of time, whenever the antenna is in the same general direction. Advanced phased array radars make this even easier, allowing a signal to be continually directed at the target. The original tracking radar system was the Semi-Automatic Ground Environment (SAGE) system developed for the US Air Force. SAGE required enormous computers to develop and maintain tracks for up to dozens of aircraft. Early airborne TWS radar typically only tracked a single target while scanning. The original TWS airborne set was the Hughes Aircraft AN/ASG-18 of the XF-108 Rapier, which could track a single target. The Westinghouse AN/APQ-81 for the F6D Missileer was more advanced, tracking up to eight targets, but required its own operator. It was not until the introduction of digital computers, and especially microprocessors, that TWS in airborne applications became practical. Development of TWS generally followed the development of the microprocessors that eventually powered them; the AN/AWG-9 of the F-14 Tomcat used an Intel 8080 and could track 24 targets.

The monument was built in 1890 by the sculptor Charles Parker Dowler to honor Samuel Smith Collyer, a fallen Pawtucket Fire Chief. The life-size bronze sculpture stands atop a pedestal of Westerly granite, which has a bronze plaque depicting the fatal accident while the reverse bears an inscription. The memorial represents a significant example of monumental work of the period and an early example of local civic pride. The monument was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1983.  Samuel Collyer  Samuel Smith Collyer was born on May 3, 1832 in Pawtucket, Rhode Island. After his schooling, he took a job at the Pawtucket Post Office as a clerk and later was a store clerk in a shop. He became a machinist and worked for a period of about seven years before becoming a partner in his uncle, Nathan S. Collyer. When Nathan Collyer died in 1877, the business passed to his wife and then to Samuel Collyer upon her death in 1879. Collyer would maintain control of the business until his death and he would serve on the board of water commissioners in charge of the development of the Pawtucket Water Works. He also played an active role in local administration as a member of the Town Council of North Providence, serving as its president for a period of three years. From 1848 to his death, Collyer was connected to the fire departments of North Providence and Pawtucket, rising to the rank of Chief Engineer in 1874. In 1851, he married Ellen Whipple and they would later have one daughter, Mary Collyer. The accident that would take the life of Samuel Collyer came in July 1884. While responding to a fire alarm, Hose Carriage #1, on which Chief Collyer was riding, struck an upright stone post on the corner on Mineral Spring and Lonsdale Avenue and tipped over. All six firefighters were injured in the accident, those less seriously were on the step and seat of the carriage, but Collyer who rode on the reel was crushed underneath. Collyer sustained a punctured lung and broken ribs, but managed to survive for almost three weeks before succumbing to his injuries. Contemporary accounts state that the funeral service and procession were the most elaborate of any in the town's history. Collyer's home, known as the Potter-Collyer House, was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1983.  Design  Full monument with fencing, 2012 The Collyer Monument was erected in 1890 by the citizens of Pawtucket for the cost of $2500. Noted sculptor Charles Dowler was commissioned to produce a life-size bronze of Collyer. Dowler sculpture measures high and wide and depicts Collyer in full firefighter's uniform with a trumpet in hand. The base is wide and tall and made of Westerly granite from Westerly, Rhode Island. A bronze plaque depicts the scene of the accident which claimed his life and his name is inscribed in an arch on the upper portion of the statue's base. The metal picket fence which encloses the statue was designed as part of the monument. On the reverse, the granite base contains the inscription commemorating Collyer who died in the line of duty. The inscription reads: Erected To The Memory / Of / Samuel S. Collyer / Who Died July 27, 1884 / While In The Discharge / Of His Duty As / Chief Engineer Of The / Pawtucket / Fire Department / Born May 3, 1832.  Significance  The Collyer Monument is historically significant as an example of \\"the representational, statically monumental approach favored by most American sculptors in the last quarter of the nineteenth century.\\" The monument is also one of the first-known civic sculptures in Pawtucket and serves as a representation of civic pride and artistry in memorializing a local who was held in utmost respect by its citizens. The dedication of this monument came on the concluding day of Pawtucket's Cotton Centenary Celebration in 1890 and was attended by Governor John W. Davis. The Collyer Monument was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1983.

He earned that designation by organizing demonstrations against discrimination throughout Maryland. Carter is best known for his work as the chairman of the Baltimore chapter of the Congress of Racial Equality (CORE) from 1960 to 1963 and as the Maryland coordinator for the 1963 March on Washington. A hospital, an elementary school, a recreation center, a college library, and a day-care center in Baltimore have been named in his memory. Early life Carter was the seventh of nine children born to Carrie P. and Walter Carter Sr. in Monroe, North Carolina. He received his bachelor's degree from North Carolina A&T;, where he participated in voter registration, the debate team, and became a member of the Progressive Party. He was well liked by his classmates and admired for his keen intellect and unusual sense of humor. Carter obtained a Master's Degree in Social Work (MSW) at Howard University. While studying at Howard, he met young Stokely Carmichael and the two became friends. Civil Rights activism Carter was a World War II veteran. He led voter registration drives in the South. As chairman of the local chapter of Congress of Racial Equality, he helped to organize the 1960 Freedom Rides to the Eastern Shore of Maryland, Gwynn Oak Park, Howard Johnson Chain, and other eating establishments along Routes 40, 1, 150, and 50; apartment buildings, hotels, and other public accommodations throughout Maryland. In 1963, he served as the Maryland coordinator of the March on Washington and, in 1965, he was a coordinator of the Federated Civil Rights Organization march with over 3,000 people protesting housing segregation. In 1963, Carter created the William L. Moore Foundation, for fellow CORE activist and Baltimorean William L. Moore. Moore was marching to the mansion of the Alabama state Governor to deliver a letter. While embarking on this lone march on April 23, 1963, in Gadsden, Alabama, Moore was shot and killed. His body was found by a passing motorist. The letter that Moore intending on giving to the Governor was later found but never delivered to the Governor of Alabama. In 1966, Carter and five other members of CORE formed Activists for Fair Housing, later shortened to Activists, Inc. That same year, the Apartment House Owners Association of Maryland was forced to open facilities to all. In the late 1960s, Carter convinced the Community Chest, now known as the United Way of Central Maryland, to fund grassroots organizations with African American constituents, such as Echo House. Carter protested segregated housing and poor living conditions that African Americans faced in Baltimore in the late 1950s and through the 1960s. He organized protest marches, often taking the fight to the homes of the white landlords who owned the segregated housing. Carter was appointed by Mayor Thomas L. J. D'Alesandro III, to head the Community Action Agency (CAA). But the Baltimore City Council voted 10‚Äì8 on September 30, 1968, to not confirm Carter's appointment. According to news accounts, William Donald Schaefer complained that Carter was \\"too radical\\", and would move the agency forward at a pace at which the city was not yet ready. Due to Carter's rejection, 12 of 21 members of the Community Action Committee, and three top members of the Urban Coalition including Parren J. Mitchell resigned from their positions to protest the rejection of Carter's nomination. Death and legacy Walter P. Carter Elementary School Walter P. Carter Recreation Center Carter died on July 31, 1971, as he was giving a report to the Black United Front, a coalition of \\"militant\\" and \\"moderate\\" Civil Rights organizations, at Rev. Vernon Dobson's Union Baptist Church in Baltimore. The day before, Carter had won a court battle against Morris Goldseker. Goldseker had sought an injunction against Carter, who had been picketing and leading protests outside Goldseker's office, calling on him to \\"Stop the Black Tax\\", referring to the excessive fees charged in his rent-to-own schemes in an effort to scam blacks out of their rights to homeownership. Goldseker had a notorious history of also engaging in a practice known as Blockbusting. Walter Carter protested against these and other discriminatory housing practices. Congressman Parren Mitchell added this to the Congressional Record: > Mr. Speaker, the State of Maryland last week, lost one of the most able > civil rights leaders in the person of Walter P. Carter. Expressions of > sympathy have come from across the nation and around the world. I think this > should be a very special lesson to this House to learn that there are whites > who recognize the contributions of a man who articulates black identity and > black awareness. The Walter P. Carter Mental Health Hospital was established on 630 West Fayette Street in Baltimore in 1976 in Carter's honor. That hospital closed in 2009. Many of its outpatient services were moved to a building operated by the University of Maryland Medical Center on 701 West Pratt Street. That building was renamed the Walter P. Carter Center, and its dedication occurred on January 5, 2010. Demolition of the original building began in early 2017 with plans to turn the site into a 300-space parking lot. There is also a day care center, a public school and a college library in Baltimore named for Carter. Every year, the children at the Walter P. Carter Elementary School participate in a \\"Walter P. Carter Day\\" program where they come up with different ways of celebrating his legacy. In 2012, Carter's relentless struggle for human and civil rights was the subject of a documentary film produced by the University of Maryland School of Psychiatry: Walter P.

The structure was built in 1875-1877 at a cost of USD$95,000. It is a nine-span stone and brick bridge with a total length of about , making it the \\"finest and longest\\" stone arch bridge in the state. It is said to be a symbolic icon of the unity of the two neighborhoods, which are divided by the river, coming together as the Town of Pawtucket. The bridge was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1983. Although it may be \\"functionally obsolete\\" relative to traffic patterns and in need of repairs, it is considered to be architecturally and historically significant.  Design  The Division Street Bridge is a nine-span stone and brick structure, with a total length of about . Each of its spans consists of a segmented arch of about in length. The road bed is wide, and there are sidewalks on either side. The mean height of the bridge above the water is . The piers of the bridge are constructed of coursed granite ashlar and the voussoirs are dressed granite with single keystones. The spandrels, the space between the arches, are filled with mortared granite rubble, and the arch barrels are constructed with an estimated 550,000 bricks. The original roadway was made of granite blocks, the seams of which were filled with tar, but this has been modified with modern asphalt paving and with the piers being modified with the addition of reinforced concrete sheathing for the river piers. The iron walkways, produced by Crowell and Sisson, project over both the sides of the bridge with iron brackets. Constructed from 1875-77 at a cost of USD $95,000, the details of the bridge's construction and its architect are unknown. A contemporary account states that the need for the bridge was first proposed in 1871, but it wasn't until a town meeting on March 1, 1875 that it would be decided upon in a vote. A commission to oversee the project included C. B. Farnsworth, William T. Adams, and William R. Walker, and the contract was awarded to Horace Foster. A local architect, William R. Walker was on the town's committee, but his role in the design or appearance of the bridge is unknown. Other figures involved in the construction of the bridge include Cushing and Company, later known as Cushing and Shedd, consulting engineers, and Horace Foster was the general contractor. Though it originally began as a contract for USD$71,000, the bridge would increase in costs to USD$95,000 due to the changes that were made. The granite was sourced from the towns of Sterling, Connecticut and Westerly, Rhode Island. Repairs for the bridge listed in the 1906 annual report recorded USD$15.82 for unspecified work. Though listed as only a footnote, repairs to the bridge were made in 1918.  Current state  The Division Street Bridge was last rehabilitated in 1985, but it remains open under no restrictions after its inspection in May 2012. Data from the National Bridge Inventory lists the superstructure and substructure as in fair condition. The scour condition is critical, but the recommended work is rehabilitation of the structure. The report estimates the cost of repairs to be USD$9,834,000. A collection of reports dating back to 1995 lists the bridge as \\"functionally obsolete\\" for its current traffic requirements. A 2006 traffic report listed the bridge as carrying 21,900 vehicles daily. In 2007 the historic bridge saw an increase in traffic, as a heavy truck detour during the reconstruction of the nearby I-95 Pawtucket Bridge. In 2012, the Pawtucket River Bridge reopened without weight restrictions to northbound traffic. The Division Street Bridge is used as part of a detour in the event of closure of the I-95 Pawtucket River bridge. Loads on the route which goes over the bridge have twice been reduced, and are now limited to 18 tons to help preserve the bridge.  Significance  The Division Street Bridge is architecturally significant as the longest stone arch bridge in Rhode Island and historically significant as a symbolic gesture to link and unify the two rapidly growing neighborhoods on Pawtucket Falls under the newly formed Town of Pawtucket. The bridge was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1983.

Located in the city's Fort Dupont neighborhood, it serves grades 6-8. Its school building, built in 1950, was the scene of civil rights action not long after its construction. Twelve black students were denied admission to the all-white school. This action was eventually overturned in the landmark 1954 Supreme Court decision in Bolling v. Sharpe, which made segregated public schools illegal in the District of Columbia. The defeat of the legal doctrine \\"separate but equal\\" marked an early victory in the modern Civil Rights Movement. The school was declared a National Historic Landmark in 2001 for its role in this action.Susan Cianci Salvatore and John H. Sprinkle, Jr. (March 8, 2001) , National Park Service and Description The John Philip Sousa Middle School is located in Southeast Washington, on the north side of Ely Place opposite Fort Dupont Park. It is a roughly L-shaped building with a brick exterior and Moderne styling, ranging in height from one to five stories. Perpendicular to the street is a wing three stories in height, which houses administrative offices and classrooms. The main entrance faces the street at the front of this section, whose street-facing end has a curved half-round elements on the right side. Extending along the road is a wing housing the school's larger spaces, the gymnasium and auditorium. History The school was built in 1950, at a time when the district's schools were segregated. Schools serving African-American students were chronically over capacity and poorly funded, while those serving white students were not. African American district residents had been agitating for some time for integration or improved conditions in their schools. A group of parents of Browne Junior High School students organized in 1949 to mount a demonstration and legal challenge to the district's segregation policies. When the new John Philip Sousa Junior High School opened in September 1950, twelve students, accompanied by parents, lawyers, and a police escort, sought to gain entry to the facility, but were denied by the principal. The ensuing legal action resulted in the landmark 1954 decision in Bolling v. Sharpe, where the Supreme Court struck down the district's segregation policy on the grounds that it violated due process (in contrast to the more well-known Brown v. Board of Education, in which state-legislated segregation was struck down on equal protection grounds). References External links *School web site *Brown v.

The objective of the game is to accurately copy gestures with the Wii Remote to the beat of the music. The game encourages players to use two Wii Remotes to play,Helix - FAQs and features 26 music tracks from independent musicians.Helix - Track List Helix was released on August 25, 2008 in North AmericaUSA WiiWare Update: Helix and on September 26, 2008 in Europe. Gameplay The player is required to copy the arm motions of a robot that dances on screen using their Wii Remotes. The player is first shown the motion, and then must perform it afterward, similar to the game simon says. A \\"Rhythm Track\\" scrolls across the top of the screen, indicating to the player when it is time for to do the motion. When the robot does a move, a \\"Move Bar\\" appears on the Rhythm Track. The Move Bar starts traveling left on the Rhythm Track after it appears. The player must then time their motion so that it is halfway completed by the time the center of the Move Bar passes by the halfway mark of the Rhythm Track. Once completing the motion, if the Move Bar turns green, the player has performed the gesture correctly, if it turns red, the move was performed incorrectly. In addition, like other music games, Helix also features a gauge that fills up with every successful move, and depletes with every failed move.Video of Helix Producer Describing Helix Development Helix was designed with as \\"a video game that happens to burn calories as a side benefit\\". In order to keep the game under the 40mb size limit imposed by Nintendo, the developers used various technologies such as music visualization instead of custom animation, and used audio compression to fit the 26 songs into the game.Ghostfire Games Interview - Helix Reception Helix received an 8.0 out of 10 from WiiWare World, saying \\"as it is, Helix is a refreshing entry into the rhythm action genre and, without a doubt, one of the more worthwhile additions to WiiWare.

It is a single-story red brick building, with a low- pitch hipped roof. Basically rectangular, an enclosed entry pavilion projects from the main block. The building was designed by William R. Walker & Son and built in 1886. Originally used as a polling place and meeting hall, it was later used as a school and by veterans organizations before being converted into a single family residence during its National Register of Historic Places nomination. It was listed on the historic register in 1983.  Design  Side view Designed by William R. Walker & Son and constructed by S. Mason & H. A. Smith in 1886, the one story red brick Queen Anne style building is basically rectangular with a low-pitched hipped roof. The red bricks are laid in dark red mortar and is contrasted by the granite sill course and brownstone belt course at window sill level. The building has a central closed entry pavilion which projects out and has two porches oriented to face Mulberry and Cedar Street. The building has three lunette windows on the sides of the main block, each divided into thirds, and a smaller windows on the pavilion's pedimented end. The rear ell has double hung two-over-two sash windows. At the time of the nomination, during the renovations to a single family home, the house had its Cedar Street porch closed in with plywood and the smaller lunette windows were boarded in, but the exterior wooden trim was largely extant.  Use  The Fifth Ward Wardroom was constructed and used as a polling place and meeting hall in a critical time when Pawtucket was incorporated as a city before later being used as a school and eventually a legion post. At the time it was nominated to the National Historic Register, the house was undergoing renovations to become a private single family residence. Prior to its conversion it was the Henrietta I. Drummond Post No. 50 of the American Legion. According to public records, the house remains a private residence.  Significance  The Fifth Ward Wardroom is historically significant as a historical reminder of the pivotal time in which Pawtucket was incorporated as a city and gave up its town-meeting form of governance. The building is also architecturally significant as a rare type of building, wardrooms, and is one of three extant examples in Rhode Island. William R. Walker & Son constructed three such structures in Pawtucket with the First Ward Wardroom being extant and the third example having been demolished. Though both constructed by William R.

The building historically has also been called the Collyer Fire Station. The Queen Anne Style station was built in 1890. It is a -story, hip-roofed rectangular brick building with two brick wings and a bell tower. Constructed of red brick with sandstone trim and sandstone lintels and sills on the windows, the building has a foliate terracotta plaque bearing its name and date of construction. The fire station was closed as a firehouse in 1974, when the current Fire Station Number 4 on Cottage Street opened. The interior of the building was greatly modified to accommodate offices and meeting rooms by the time of its listing on the national register. In 2014, the building is being used by the Catholic Charities of Providence. Fire Station Number 4 was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1983. Design Fire Station Number 4, also known as the Collyer Fire Station, (see building plaque) was constructed in 1887-1888 by H. L. Bassett & Co. and F. L. Mason on the southwest corner of Broadway and Carnation Street, in the center of Pleasant View neighborhood. The building was completed and named in 1890. The main block of the Queen Anne-styled red brick firehouse is a -story, hip-roofed rectangle with a cross-gable facing Broadway. A pair of matching single-story wings with gable- on-hipped roofs project from the long sides of the building. The building has small hip-roofed porches with arched openings on the main entrance and Broadway facing sides. Though constructed of red brick and pinkish mortar, sandstone was used for the window sills and lintels and the station's trim. The building has detailed terracotta work, with an ornate foliate name and date plaque on the front gable and a string course at the base of the corbeled main entrance. Above the plaque is a semi-circular window, and another round- headed window is on the northern side. The northwest corner has a square hose drying/bell tower that also has its own round headed window. Photos of the building are available here. The station has been modified; its two fire engine doors have been removed and replaced with modern garage doors. The pyramidal roof on the belfry which crowned the bell tower was \\"recently\\" removed at the time of its NRHP nomination in 1983. The interior of the firehouse has been greatly altered in the conversion to office and meeting room space by the time of its National Register of Historic Places nomination. The surviving details included the Queen Anne staircase and sunken panel doors. Though the interior has been greatly modified, it did not prevent its listing on the historic register. Use In 1974, Fire Station Number 4 was replaced by a new Fire Station Number 4 located on 397 Cottage Street. This was not to be the only replacement of the firehouses which would be reused through the Community Development Block Grant program, which assisted in the adaptation in the late 1970s and into the 1980s. By the time of its nomination, the fire station had been re-purposed as office and meeting space for city agencies. In 2014, the property was used by the Catholic Charities of Providence for Project Hope as a \\"Diocesan community advocacy, parish outreach and social service assistance center\\". In 2017, a new tenant, Rhode Island bankruptcy lawyer John S. Simonian, became a tenant in the building. Significance The Fire Station Number 4 is architecturally significant as an example of a late 19th-century Queen Anne-style firehouse. The firehouse's distinguishing feature is the corbeled cornice and terracotta trim, but also it is historically significant as an example of Pawtucket's maturation as a city. The boundary for the property is listed as Plat 7B, lot 164 and includes the surrounding area, totaling less than one acre.

Built in 1878, the two-story multi-gabled house is distinguished by its clapboarded and exterior woodwork and opulent parlors in the interior. The property also has a matching carriagehouse with gable roof and cupola. The house was originally constructed and owned by Theodore Waters Foster, but it was sold to George W. Payne in 1882. The Foster‚ÄìPayne House is architecturally significant as a well-designed and well-preserved late 19th century suburban residence. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1983. History The house was built in 1878 for Theodore Waters Foster, born on May 19, 1847, to Chauncey Foster and Ophelia Remington. He was educated in Pawtucket and joined the Rhode Island Cavalry in 1863. He served in the American Civil War under Nathaniel P. Banks in the Red River Campaign. In 1873, he formed a jewelry-manufacturing partnership with Walter E. White and Samuel H. Baily, named White, Foster & Company. After White retired in 1878, the company was renamed Foster & Bailey. During this time, Foster constructed the house and lived in it for a period of four years, commuting to his place of business in Providence, Rhode Island. Foster would continue to be successful in his jewelry manufacturing business and his son, Theodore Clyde Foster, would succeed him upon his death in 1928. In 1882, Theodore Foster sold the home to George W. Payne, the owner of the G. W. Payne & Company. Design Constructed in 1878, the Foster‚ÄìPayne House is a two-story home with a low-pitched multi-gabled roof. The house has a single story open porch on the western side, a kitchen ell that projects from the rear and a single- story bay window that projects from the western bay of the front facade. The house is distinguished by its clapboard exterior and wooden trim under the gable peaks, the window trim and the porch brackets. There are three types of windows used on the house, single and paired one-over-one windows and two- over-two windows. The small foyer on the western entry porch leads to the main stairhall that features a gently curving staircase with turned balusters and a curving rail. The first floor rooms are arranged in an \\"L\\" pattern on the southern and eastern sides with the kitchen placed on the northern ell. The interior of one room, not specified in the NRHP nomination, has been altered with a pressed tin ceiling. The second floor of the home was not described in the NRHP nomination. The interior of the rooms display late Victorian details, with the front parlor having a carved marble mantlepiece, a molded central ceiling medallion and a painted ceiling with scroll-work. The back parlor has a marbleized slate mantlepiece with an over-mounted mirror in a Renaissance Revival frame. On the back edge of the lot is a two-story clapboarded carriagehouse with a Victorian cupola. This structure was not described in the NRHP nomination, but a photo from 2013 shows the cupola has been damaged. Significance The house is architecturally significant as a well-designed and well-preserved late 19th century suburban residence, with excellent interior detail and a matching carriagehouse. The area in which it is located was situated in an upper-class suburban area, but since the late 19th-century commercial and industrial buildings have entered the area.

Constructed in 1896-1897, the two Queen Anne-styled homes were constructed as rental properties for the Fuller family and are believed to have originally been identical in construction. The -story houses are marked by an octagonal bay which contains the front staircase and a large two-story porch projecting almost completely from the house itself. For the National Register of Historic Places nomination only a single unit was examined, but the identical unit below is believed to have undergone minimal alterations. The other house, 343-345 Broadway, was not surveyed, but has been more seriously modified to allow for four apartment units. The Fuller Houses are architecturally significant as well-preserved and well-detailed Queen Anne-styled apartment flats. The Fuller Houses were added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1983. History The Fuller Houses were constructed in 1896-1897 for Susan E. Fuller. Fuller's husband, Charles H. Fuller, operated a successful jewelry findings firm. The Fullers owned the houses until 1915, and intended to use them as rental properties. The only member of the Fuller family to reside in one of the houses, specifically 341 Broadway, was Alice G. Fuller beginning in either 1911 or 1912. The houses are positioned to be prominently viewed from their location on the east side of U.S Route 1 and from northbound traffic on Interstate 95. Though not originally placed in a location of such prominence, the construction through the heart of Pawtucket greatly increased the visibility of these \\"I-95 landmarks\\". Design The Fuller Houses are originally believed to have been constructed as identical -story Queen Anne-styled homes with both having their gable-ends facing the street. The southern flank of the building is visually broken up by a two-story bay window with a gabled peak. A semi-octagonal bay on the northern corner of the houses indicates the position of the front staircase. A single-story porch with a shed-roof overhangs the front doorways. A striking feature of the Fuller Houses is the two-story circular porch on the southwest side. The porches are almost removed from the building and topped with a conical roof and ornamented with Queen Anne-style spindle. The exterior walls of the houses are clapboarded and the tops of the gables have simple metal finials. For the National Register of Historic Places nomination, only the interior of one of the four units was surveyed, the second floor interior of 341 Broadway. This unit is accessed from a spiral staircase leading from the first floor to the attic. The second floor landing has a short foyer before opening to two parlors. The front parlor is said to have had a water fountain which was removed, but the plumbing is said to exist within the floor. The back parlor has a Queen Anne mantel and leads to the dining room with large floor-to-ceiling china closets. Located on the east side of the apartment is the kitchen, pantry and rear staircase. The north part of the apartment contains two bedrooms and a bath. The NRHP nomination states that the alterations to the unit were minimal and it is likely that the same would have been done for the first floor unit. The northern Fuller House, containing 343-345 Broadway, has been more seriously modified because it has been split into four units. In 2013, real estate information for 343 Broadway suggests the expanse of the modifications to the house by listing the property as having 20 rooms, with 8 bedrooms and 5 baths. According to Trulia the house was sold in 2010 for $140,000 and still in the four unit configuration. A three-bay stuccoed garage dating from the 1920s or 1930 is used by 339-341 Broadway. Significance The Fuller Houses are architecturally significant as a pair of two well-preserved and well-detailed two-family Queen Anne-style apartment \\"flat\\" houses. The Queen Anne-style spindle-work porches are descriptive in the NRHP nomination as the most impressive examples remaining in Pawtucket.

The Pigeon is also a designated Natural Riverhttp://www.michigan.gov/dnr/0,1607,7-153-30301_31431_31442-95812--,00.html with special regulations regarding development along its banks.  Name  The Pigeon River was named for the huge flocks of passenger pigeons that nested in and migrated through the area, before the species became extinct, primarily due to over-hunting.  Dam failures  There is one dam on the Pigeon located approximately one mile upstream from Sturgeon Valley Road. The original dam was an earth and log structure constructed by a private hunting and fishing club in the early to mid 20th century to create a pond called the Lansing Club pond. This dam failed in the late 1950s, washing accumulated sediment downstream, harming fish and insect populations and habitat. Another concrete dam was built, this one able to use the hydropower to generate electricity. Golden Lotus Inc. bought the property from the club and set up a retreat called Song Of The Morning Ranch (SOM). They used the dam to provide electricity. In 1984 SOM conducted planned drawdown of the pond in order to perform maintenance work on the dam. During this drawdown, there was another dam failure, resulting in a massive sediment discharge for several days. The discharge caused a massive fish kill immediately, and destroyed critical fish and insect habitat for many years. In an ensuing court case, Golden Lotus maintained that they'd been following standard procedures under DNR supervision. Stricter regulations were placed on the dam operation at that point. Another dam failure, the third in 75 years, occurred in 2008. A heavy rainstorm resulted in another large sediment release from the pond, with another massive fish and habitat kill.

It was built in 1922, listed on the National Register in 1983, and demolished in 1997. The building The Leroy was one of the finest and largest theatres of the period in all of New England, built when Pawtucket was at its economic height. It was one of the finest buildings in a city already brimming with distinguished architecture. The lobby featured a large fireplace, a grand staircase, and a frieze of golden vases. The interior had seats for 2,700 people, and included extensive ornamentation such as mirrors, colored lights, brass rails, and gold leaf. It had a mirrored lobby, an electric chandelier with 4,700 bulbs, and the largest Wurlitzer organ in New England. Above the balcony was a dome filled with classical sculpted figures. History The theatre was designed by architect John F. O'Malley and was built in 1922 for client Charles Payne, a power company executive. Payne spared no expense on the building, named in honor of Payne's son Leroy, who had been killed in World War I. The theatre opened in May 1923. Charles Payne died four years later, on January 5, 1927, at age 59. At the time of the Leroy's construction, Pawtucket was a prosperous mill town. In addition to the Leroy, it boasted a half-dozen theatres and two dozen hotels. Of these, the Leroy was considered the town's \\"most lavish public building\\", and was referred to as Pawtucket's Million Dollar Theatre. The Leroy hosted vaudeville acts, silent (and then sound) movies, and all manner of theatrical productions and musical performances. However, by the late 1960s, the once-wealthy mill town had fallen into decline, and moviegoers had begun to prefer suburban multiplexes to the old downtown movie palaces. The theatre was closed in 1963, briefly reopened in 1976, and was again shuttered. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1983. A ballet company briefly attempted to use the theatre in 1984, and it was operated as a concert hall from 1985 to 1990. In April 1997 the building was sold to a Boston developer and demolished later that year, along with three neighboring buildings, to build a Walgreens drugstore.

It was designed by William Granville Hastings and cast by the Gorham Manufacturing Company in 1897. Unlike many Civil War memorials, Liberty Arming the Patriot is a dynamic composition, depicting a young farmer setting his plow aside, and reaching to take a sword from a classical female figure clad in breastplate and wielding a pike. The statue is in height, and is mounted on a granite base high and wide. The sculpture was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2001.  History and design  Close up of the statue The sculpture was commissioned by the Ladies' Soldiers' Memorial Association of Pawtucket, Rhode Island to honor those who served in the American Civil War. The funding for the sculpture came as the result of an 11-year fundraising campaign that was provided for by donations and entertainment events. The cost of the monument was stated to be $13,000 by The New York Times, but report stated it to be $12,000. William Granville Hastings was chosen as the sculptor to execute the construction of the monument after winning a competition. The sculpture was cast by the Gorham Manufacturing Company. The central feature of the monument depicts the theme of a young man called from civil life to serve his nation in a time of need and it transforms the theme into a contemporary allegory. It captures the decisive moment as farmer is caught mid-transition, with his left hand still on the plow handle, and taking the sword with his right hand from Liberty. The details of the farmer includes realistic work clothes, a yoked shirt with rolled sleeves and work trousers tucked into his boots. Liberty, identified by her Phrygian cap, stands just above the farmer in classical robes with a breastplate, sandals and cloak. Her face is impassive as she bestows the sword upon the farmer with her left hand while her right hand holds her pike. Beneath the farmer and Liberty is a bronze plaque depicting a Union artillery battery under the command of General Ambrose Burnside capturing a bridge in the Battle of Antietam. Flanked on the sides are two smaller triangular plaques which depict the female figures of History and Eternity. The Scribe of History, alternatively known as Epic Poetry, is writing on a tablet and Eternity both contemplates and is identified by a fern. The monument was dedicated on May 31, 1897, in ceremony conducted by the Grand Army of the Republic and an oration given by the Governor of Rhode Island, Elisha Dyer, Jr.. The statue is in height, and is mounted on a granite base high and wide. According to the National Register of Historic Places, Liberty Arming the Patriot is historically significant as a \\"good representative of the character of early twentieth century figurative sculpture\\" and the quality of its design. It is also historically significant for its association with the Gorham Manufacturing Company, a prominent Rhode Island producer of high quality silverware and bronze statuary. Though it is commemorative in intention, the statue is important \\"because it documents the principal effort of Pawtucket to honor those who served in the Civil War.\\" The sculpture was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2001.

Vincennes Nat. Bank, 113 U.S. 408 (1885), was a case involving the sale of property conveyed to Hyatt for a term of 50 years for all the mineral coal upon and under a described tract of land, in Knox County, Indiana, with the exclusive right to enter on the land to dig for the coal, and remove it, and to occupy with constructions and buildings as needed to obtain the coal. Hyatt would then have the right to remove all buildings or fixtures placed on the land, when the agreement expired, and to pay a fixed royalty for the coal mined. Background Under a judgment against Hyatt, the Sheriff of Knox County executed a judgment to a creditor by selling at the Knox County courthouse door, as prescribed by statute for the sale of real estate, the interest of Hyatt in the term of years and certain buildings and articles belonging to him, which were a part of the structures and machinery for operating a coal mine on the land, and which were firmly attached to the land.

When, by any law of this state, real estate is authorized or directed to be sold by virtue of any execution, the same shall be construed to mean and include, 1. all the lands, tenements, and hereditaments of the judgment debtor, whether, in possession, reversion, or remainder; 2. lands, tenements, and hereditaments fraudulently conveyed with intent to defeat, delay, or defraud creditors; 3. all rights of redeeming mortgaged lands, tenements, or hereditaments, and also all lands held by virtue of any land office certificate; 4. lands, tenements, and hereditaments, and any estate or interest therein, holden by anyone in trust for or to the use of another, on execution issued on any judgment against the person to whose use, or for whose benefit, the same are holden.\\" The provisions of these four clauses were substantially retained in the Revision of 1852, and the provision as to \\"chattels real of the judgment debtor\\" was added as a 5th clause. Although, by the Revised Statutes of 1843, part 2, chap. 29; Art. 1, ¬ß 3, p. 454, judgments were made a lien on real estate and chattels real of the judgment debtor, which provision is contained in the Revision of 1852, part 2, c. 1, Art. 24, ¬ß 527, vol. 2 of Davis' edition of 1876, chattels real were not specifically made liable to sale on execution as real estate until 1852, when the 5th clause was added. That clause must be interpreted according to the accepted meaning of the words \\"chattels real.\\" Blackstone defines chattels real, according to Sir Edward Coke, 1 Inst. 118, to be such as concern or savor of the realty, as terms for years of land, and says they are called real chattels as being interests issuing out of or annexed to real estates, of which they have one quality, viz., immobility, which denominates them real, but want the other, viz., a sufficient legal indeterminate duration, which want it is that constitutes them chattels. 2 Bl.Com. 386. Chancellor Kent says, 2 Kent 342: *\\"Chattels real are interests annexed to or concerning the realty, as a lease for years of land, and the duration of the term of the lease is immaterial, provided it be fixed and determinate, and there be a reversion or remainder in fee in some other person. \\" The motion made in the circuit court to modify the decree was based on the idea, that while the term for years might be a chattel real, the machinery, buildings, fixtures, and improvements placed on the land should have been sold as personal property. As the statute requires that real estate \\"shall\\" be sold at the door of the courthouse, the visible property could not be sold there in view of the persons attending the sale of the real estate, unless it was first severed from the land, and to have so treated it would, doubtless, have rendered not only it but the term for years worthless, as vendible articles. No such result could have been contemplated by the lawmakers, and none such can be allowed, if another reasonable and consistent construction is to be found. It is not necessary or proper to consider any question involved in any right of redemption. Nor is it intended to decide anything as to the status of any of the property, aside from the lawfulness of the manner of its sale, under the statute in regard to such sale. The decree of the circuit court was affirmed.

The family car was located at the bottom of a cliff at Loch Ard Gorge in Port Campbell on 2 July with the bodies of the four victims still inside.Police flooded with tips after posting murder suspect reward, Australian Broadcasting Corporation, 25 February 2008 Elmer Kyle Crawford (born c. 1930) who has not been seen since the incident, is the prime suspect in the murders. Investigation Two weeks before the murders, Crawford, an employee of the Victoria Racing Club, and his wife, 35-year-old Therese Crawford, drafted new wills that left a considerable fortune to Crawford in the event of his family's death.Elmer Crawford electrocuted family, bashed daughter, Herald Sun, 11 February 2008 At the time of the murders, the couple had three children: Katherine Jane, 13, James William, 8, and Karen Jean, 6. It is believed by investigators that the impending arrival of their fourth child and Therese Crawford's mental state were the triggers for the murders. Another factor could have been the theft of goods by Crawford from the VRC. A July 1971 coroner's inquest found that Crawford, who had emigrated from Ireland in 1951, murdered his wife and three children at home in Cardinal Road, Glenroy. Crawford had constructed an electrocution device, using a length of electrical lead and alligator clips. He attached the alligator clips to his wife's ears while she slept and electrocuted her. He then battered his children to death, presumably using the hammer found in the car, and electrocuted both Katherine and James. He then loaded their blanket-wrapped bodies, along with a motorbike, fuel cans, rifle, and hose into the family's Holden FE sedan (the back seat had also been removed). He then drove them to Port Campbell where he connected the hose from the exhaust to the driver's side window, before pushing the car over the cliff edge in an effort to frame his wife by making the crime look like a murder-suicide.Where is Elmer Crawford?, The Age, 1 July 2005 To aid the vehicle's movement, he had also laid a stone pathway across a drainage ditch in front of the vehicle.  Search  Crawford, who was last seen in his driveway on the day of the vehicle's discovery, has been missing since the murders, although he was reportedly spotted in 1994 in Western Australia by an acquaintance. A reward of A$100,000 was offered in 2008 for information leading to his arrest. In July 2010, Victorian Police announced that they were, in conjunction with the FBI, attempting to identify a man, via facial recognition technology, who died in 2005 in San Angelo, Texas, United States, that they believed to be Crawford. The man had no fingerprints and carried multiple identity documents.

Crist√≥bal Col√≥n was a armored cruiser of the Spanish Navy that fought at the Battle of Santiago de Cuba during the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War. Technical characteristics Crist√≥bal Col√≥n was built in Italy under the name Giuseppe Garibaldi, being the second ship of the class to be laid down with that name. She was laid down in 1895, launched in September 1896, sold to Spain, and delivered to the Spanish Navy at Genoa on 16 May 1897.The Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War Centennial Website: Cristobal Colon She had two funnels and was fast, well armed, and well protected, especially for her displacement. She was designed to be an intermediate type of ship between extant battleships and cruisers, powerful enough to function as a part of a battle fleet and yet fast enough to outrun more powerful ships, and in this sense was the Spanish Navy's first true armored cruiser. However, the Spanish Ministry of Marine rejected her guns, and she was delivered without them, detracting considerably from her designed firepower; she was lost before the guns could be installed.The Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War Centennial Website: Cristobal Colon, and Conway's All the World's Fighting Ships 1860‚Äì1905, p. 382 Operational history Crist√≥bal Col√≥n was part of the Spanish Navy's 1st Squadron when tensions with the United States were rising after the explosion and sinking of the battleship in the harbor at Havana, Cuba on 15 February 1898. The squadron concentrated at S√£o Vicente in Portugal's Cape Verde Islands; departing Cadiz on 8 April. The Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War began while Crist√≥bal Col√≥n was at S√£o Vicente. Ordered by neutral Portugal in accordance with international law to leave S√£o Vicente within 24 hours of the declaration of war, Crist√≥bal Col√≥n and the rest of Cervera's squadron departed on 29 April 1898, bound for San Juan, Puerto Rico. Cervera's ships reached French-owned Martinique in the Lesser Antilles on 10 May 1898. While Crist√≥bal Col√≥n and the other large ships loitered in international waters, two Spanish destroyers went into Fort- de-France to ask for coal. France was neutral and would not supply coal, so the Spanish squadron departed on 12 May 1898 for Dutch-owned Cura√ßao, where Cervera expected to meet a collier. Cervera arrived at Willemstad on 14 May 1898, but the Netherlands was also neutral, and strictly enforced its neutrality by allowing only and her sister ship to enter port and permitting them to load only of coal. On 15 May, Cervera's ships departed, no longer bound for San Juan, which by now was under a U.S. Navy blockade, but for as- yet unblockaded Santiago de Cuba on the southeastern coast of Cuba, arriving there on 19 May 1898. Cervera hoped to refit his ships there before he could be trapped. His squadron was still in the harbor of Santiago de Cuba when an American squadron arrived on 27 May 1898 and began a blockade which would drag on for 37 days. Crist√≥bal Col√≥n was anchored in the entrance channel to the harbor in a position where she could support the harbor's shore batteries, and on 28 May 1898 was the first unit of Cervera's squadron the American blockaders identified as being at Santiago de Cuba. The first American offensive action of the blockade was to attack her. At 1400 hours on 31 May 1898, the battleships and and cruiser opened fire on Crist√≥bal Col√≥n and the shore fortifications at the then-great range of 7,000 yards (6,400 m), and Crist√≥bal Col√≥n and the coastal artillery returned fire. The Americans ceased fire at 1410, and the Spanish at 1500. Neither side suffered any casualties. The blockade wore on, with Crist√≥bal Col√≥n and the others enduring occasional American naval bombardments of the harbor. Some of her men joined others from the fleet in a Naval Brigade to fight against a U.S. Army overland drive toward Santiago de Cuba. By the beginning of July 1898, that drive threatened to capture Santiago de Cuba, and Cervera decided that his squadron's only hope was to try to escape into the open sea by running the blockade. The decision was made on 1 July 1898, with the break-out set for 3 July 1898. The crew of Crist√≥bal Col√≥n spent 2 July 1898 returning from Naval Brigade service and preparing for action. With Vice Admiral Cervera aboard, Infanta Mar√≠a Teresa was to lead the escape, sacrificing herself by attacking the fastest American ship, armored cruiser , allowing the rest of the squadron to avoid action and run westward for the open sea. At about 0845 hours on 3 July 1898, the Spanish ships got underway and moved out in line-ahead formation, with Crist√≥bal Col√≥n third in line, following Infanta Mar√≠a Teresa and armored cruiser ; armored cruiser and destroyers and came along behind Crist√≥bal Col√≥n. The U.S. squadron sighted the Spanish ships in the channel at about 0935, and the Battle of Santiago de Cuba began. While Infanta Mar√≠a Teresa and Vizcaya charged Brooklyn, Crist√≥bal Col√≥n, Almirante Oquendo, and the two destroyers turned west and worked up steam to make a run for the open sea. When Brooklyn turned eastward and away from Infanta Mar√≠a Teresa, all four Spanish armored cruisers wound up in the same line-ahead formation they had formed when leaving the harbor, brushing past the last obstacle in their path, the armed yacht . The action now developed into a hot stern chase, with the U.S. squadron about a mile to port of the Spanish ships and slightly behind them, every ship on both sides firing with every gun she could bring to bear. Crist√≥bal Col√≥n hit Iowa twice, wrecking her dispensary with the first hit and holing her below the waterline with the second, slowing Iowa but not forcing her to cease fire. The outgunned Spanish squadron began to take losses, its ships catching fire and grounding themselves before their magazines could explode. Infanta Mar√≠a Teresa was first, shearing out of line and beaching herself at about 1025 a few miles west of Santiago de Cuba; Almirante Oquendo ran up on the beach a few hundred yards farther west five minutes later. At 1106, Vizcaya turned hard to starboard and ran herself ashore. With the two Spanish destroyers by now also sunk, Crist√≥bal Col√≥n steamed on alone, the last survivor of Cervera's squadron. For a time, it seemed that she might get away. Although her machinery was not able to get her up to her top speed after months of hard steaming, she was rated as the fastest ship of either side in the battle, was better armored and armed than her erstwhile squadron mates, and thus far had taken only two 5-inch (127 mm) or 6-inch (152 mm) hits. She was making , and the fastest and closest U.S. ship, Brooklyn, was now six miles (10 km) behind her. Vixen was close behind Brooklyn. Armored cruiser , making , was closing, and, farther behind, battleships and also were making their best speed in pursuit. After another hour, Crist√≥bal Col√≥n had run through all of her best coal, switched to an inferior grade, and began to lose speed. At 1220, Oregon fired a 13-inch (330-mm) round which landed just astern of Crist√≥bal Col√≥n, and soon more rounds, as well as 8-inch (203-mm) shells from Brooklyn and New York, were landing around the Spanish ship. In contrast, she had only one 6-inch (152-mm) gun that would bear on her pursuers. All told, the Spanish cruiser was hit six times.Berner, Brad K. (1998). The Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War: A Historical Dictionary. Volume 8 of Historical Dictionaries of War, Revolution, and Civil Unrest. Scarecrow Press, p. 92. When the range dropped to 2,000 yards (1,830 m), the commanding officer of Crist√≥bal Col√≥n, Captain Emilio D√≠az-Moreu y Quintana, decided that after a 50-mile run, the chase was over; in order to save the lives of her crew, he beached her at the mouth of the Tarquino River, west of Santiago, at 1315 hours. It was the end of the Battle of Santiago de Cuba. Some of her sailors made it ashore, although they had to beware of Cuban insurgents, who began to shoot the survivors of the wrecked Spanish ships. Others were rescued by American sailors who came alongside the wreck in small boats to take off survivors. That night, a U.S. Navy salvage team from repair ship decided that Crist√≥bal Col√≥n was worth salvaging and towed her off the rocks. But she lacked watertight integrity and quickly capsized and sank, a total loss. Notes References * Chesneau, Roger, and Eugene M. Kolesnik, Eds. Conway's All the World's Fighting Ships 1860‚Äì1905.

Its name means slow (and) violent, as this style typically has a tempo between 85 and 115 BPM. It consists of a hard kick, like the ones present in hardcore or hardstyle, but played at a very slow tempo, with vocal samples and dark and acid sounds or loops. Origins The first tracks with the Lento Violento sound were Anima Ladina by Ottomix (1991), Panic Mouse (stress mix) by Gigi d'Agostino (1996), Ibiza by Ottomix (1998) and Alex Castelli's Enjoy, that was co-produced by Ottomix. Although at that time, they were not called 'Lento Violento' yet. These tracks were influenced by the more techno and trance-oriented tracks like Mauro Picotto's Lizard, Iguana, Pulsar, Tuttincoro or Raggattak by Joman (Joy Kitikonti), all from the Italian BXR label. While some individual tracks were popular in the clubs, the style itself was not established until DJ/producer Gigi D'Agostino started with a series of productions in 2003, like Ripassa. Indeed, he coined the name for this style, and he releases most of his Lento Violento songs on his own label Noise Maker, using aliases like Dottor Dag, Lento Violento Man, Uomo Suono, Orchestra Maldestra, or La Tana Del Suono, to distinguish these songs from his Italo dance work. Other artists started to create similar tracks after the success of this style. Also several compilation CDs are released with Lento Violento music, like the \\"Movimentolento\\" series. In fact Lento Violento is trademark restricted by Gigi D'Agostino to series of his compilation. Any other artist can't use this name. Gigi always says that 'lento violento' is not music style, that's why most producers use names 'slowstyle' or 'hard slowstyle'. =Reemergence in hardstyle= Italian producer Technoboy, in his track \\"The Undersound\\" released in 2009, fused Lento with modern hardstyle elements; while the track claims to christen the new genre \\"undersound\\", the term \\"lento\\" is still used occasionally to denominate hardstyle tracks. Technoboy himself has continued to use such motifs in his tracks like \\"Catfight\\", and the track \\"MF Point of Lento\\" by Brennan Heart and Headhunterz explicitly calls Technoboy the most prominent artist of the genre.

Though the round-head picket fence and entry gates were later removed, the property retains a large shaded garden on with ample street frontage. The Charles Payne House was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1983.  History  The house was constructed by Charles Payne, an engraver who founded the firm of Payne & Taylor for calico printers in 1849. In 1849, Payne becan to purchase parcels of land that he would later construct the house on. The main block of the house was erected in 1855‚Äì1856 and later expanded with a north wing in the mid-1870s. The final major addition was an ell on the west side of the house, the date of construction occurred prior to 1902. Though the house has been the subject of some alterations, these changes are largely inconspicuous.  Design  The Charles Payne House is a -story Gothic-Italianate vernacular cottage that has a spacious garden founded on the site of a long-removed house. The house's gable end faces the street with a rear ell and the other ell perpendicular to the main block on the west side. Centered on the east end of the roof is a cross gable which is visually offset by the dormer on the west. The house has a small gable-roofed vestibule on the east side, aligned underneath the cross- gable. The rear ell has an attached porch that spans its length. A single story bay hexagonal bay window protrudes from the facade. The distinguishing feature of the Payne house is the wood trim exterior, consisting of hood mould on the paired windows on the south, four kinds of bargeboards and bracketed cornices on the rear ell's east side. The interior of the Charles Payne House is not covered in detail by any survey, but has three mantelpieces on the first floor, two displaying Gothic Revival influence in their wooden designs and the third, located in the rear ell, made of grey marble with a round-head opening. Though not mentioned in the nomination, a photo shows one of the wooden mantlepieces filled with brick and rendered unusable at the time. The setting of the house was important to the National Register nomination, which specifically highlighted its shaded garden and fencing. At the time of the nomination, an ornamental round head picket fence surrounded the property and access was through a double-leaf lattice work gate.

Later it was sold to Lyman B. Goff, another local industrialist, who made significant alterations to the interior, replacing a great deal of the older woodwork with more fashionable Queen Anne styling in 1881. He also modified the exterior, but these changes were largely limited to the porch, which also exhibits fine Queen Anne detailing. Goff deeded the house to daughter, Elizabeth Goff Wood, in 1922. In 1941 she donated the house to the Pawtucket Congregational Church for use by the local chapter of the American Red Cross. It has since served as a headquarters for the Boy Scouts of America, and in 1970 it was the first location of the Rhode Island Children's Museum.

Background Indian Railway network particularly High Density Network, which connects the four Metro Cities of Delhi, Kolkata, Chennai and Mumbai including the diagonals is over saturated. Challenges of higher economic growth require leap forward capacity development strategy on Indian Railways. Paradigms of such a strategy required a shift from dependence on purely budgetary sources and internal surplus of Railways to mobilization of non-budgetary financial resources from private sector, banks, financial institutions, multilateral and bilateral agencies through a mix of equity and debt. The financial resources available from the traditional sources were found to be grossly inadequate to meet the requirement. The Ministry of Railways, therefore, had been considering various innovative methods of project distribution and creation of assets. Another paradigm shift required was to change from project mode of planning to programme mode to be implemented in a time bound manner. It was felt that the Railways instead of becoming the bottleneck in economic growth of the country should spur economic growth by development of capacity ahead of demand. It required fast track implementation of projects adopting established practice of financial closure and use of modern project management techniques. For this, adequate and uninterrupted flow of funds is a prime requirement. It also required mechanization of construction involving large number of construction machines and equipments of varied nature and skill sets of altogether different kind.

The house, first constructed in 1863, is representative of vernacular architecture of the Pawtucket due to the great modifications to the home which has obscured the original structure of the home. Believed to have begun as a -story cottage with a gable roof, subsequent additions and expansions have added a two-story hip-roof addition and greatly altered the floor plan due to enlargement and remodeling. The Potter‚ÄìCollyer House was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1983.  History  The house was originally constructed in 1863 for Elisha O. Potter, but it was sold to Samuel S. Collyer four years later. Little is known of Potter's life, but Collyer was a partner in the N. S. Collyer & Company. Collyer would later become the Chief of the Pawtucket Fire Department in 1874 and died in 1884 from injuries sustained in the line of duty. Collyer would be memorialized by the town with the Collyer Monument, which is also on the National Register of Historic Places. The house was moved from its original location in 1962 due to the construction of Interstate 95 in Rhode Island.  Design  The house is a timber frame house that was originally constructed on the west side of Pine Street, but its original form is not known for sure due to the extent of its expansion and remodeling. The NRHP nomination states that it could have been a -story gabled roof cottage with a cross-gable in the center, a style popular during the mid-century in Pawtucket. This original structure retains little of its form except for the Gothic hood moulds on the second floor end windows and the Gothic bargeboards. A two-story hipped roof addition was constructed in two phases, one completed before 1877 and the other between 1895 and 1902. Though the NRHP also states that the original house was enlarged in the late 1860s or 1870s without specification to the work done at the time. The additions include a bay window on the facade and openwork on the porch sides. The later alterations to the building worked to complement the distinctive bargeboards of the cottage with the work on the eaves and window heads of the addition. The house has an unconventional floor plan which has two doorways on opposite ends of the original cottage with the main entrance formerly on the east side. The NRHP nomination again notes that the doorways may have replaced an earlier vestibule on the original house. The eastern entrance leads to a library/office, that may have originally been a stairhall, and is connected to the eastern of the two front rooms. The western doorway, opposite, leads to a hallway with a three-run staircase with newels and balusters. The western room has a Renaissance Revival-style built-in bookcase and a slate fireplace mantel. The rear addition holds the dining room which has a \\"pseudo-exposed- beam ceiling\\" dated to around 1909. Though not detailed in the NRHP listing, the survey notes that the upstairs is simple in detail and appears intact, but that the \\"chamber floor plan in the front of the house appears to have been altered during the 1880s remodeling\\".  Significance  The Potter‚ÄìCollyer House is architecturally significant as a unique example of vernacular architecture of Pawtucket in the 19th century. The NRHP nomination states that the alterations and remodeling of the home have produced a \\"most unusually composed and picturesquely detailed [building].\\" Despite having been moved and altered, the house is unique and significant example of vernacular architecture.

The park is named after Samuel Slater, a famous American industrialist who constructed America's first water-powered textile mill in Pawtucket. The park lies on the banks of the beautiful Ten Mile River and features the 1685 Daggett House, the oldest house in Pawtucket. The park was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1976. It also features an original Looff Carousel. History Covering , the majority of the land (formerly known as the Daggett farm) was purchased by the city in 1894. The land of the original Daggett farm bore little resemblance to the park that exists today. The Providence Journal described the original tract as \\"...part swamp and part remains of a wornout farm... In its primitive state less than one-quarter of this area was open to the public. The rest was either densely wooded or so swampy that it was impossible to penetrate anywhere without sinking deep into the mud.\\"\\"Pawtucket's Champion Beauty Spot\\". The Providence Journal, July 14, 1912. Section V. p.3. Initial development of the park did not begin until 1907 when major improvements were made to this situation. All the swamp growth was removed in the process of turning the low-lying areas into ponds. The heavy underbrush on higher ground was also cleared out, while the established pines and maples were carefully preserved. At the same time, hundreds of oak and pine saplings were set out in selected areas, and grass was coaxed to grow once more on the abandoned fields. The result of these programs is a park which today displays a nearly even balance between grassy fields and open woods. In 1894, the only roadway on the Daggett farm ran in a straight line from Armistice Boulevard (then Brook Street) to the Daggett House. A major project in the first years of park development was the building of a network of winding drives which opened most of the park to the driving public. At the same time, a system of paths was begun, with emphasis on walks along the river bank, the shores of the ponds, and out across a pair of bridges to the island in the Ten Mile River. Between 1909 and 1917, several buildings were also erected within the park. This early development was largely directed by three men: the City Engineer, George Carpenter; the president of the Park Commission, James C. Potter; and the first Park Superintendent, George Saunders. Notable features of the Park In addition to the Daggett House and Looff Carousel, the park contains other buildings and features: * Slater Park Zoo: Early in Slater Park's development, a small collection of animals was put on display just across from the Daggett House. In 1916, this miniature zoo housed only pigeons, rabbits, and deer which roamed in a fenced run. Suffering financially, much of the zoo was closed in the 1990s.\\"R.I. TOWN COUNCIL VOTES TO SHUT ZOO\\". The Boston Globe, January 22, 1993. Today, while many of the original enclosures are still there, the area now serves as a petting zoo called Daggett Farm. * Potter Casino: Built in 1917, the \\"casino\\" or \\"resthouse\\" was constructed on the shores of the central pond. The building was the gift of James C. Potter, a member of the Pawtucket Park Commission since its inception, and its president since 1904. A Pawtucket architect, R. C. N. Monahan, designed the rest house in the Colonial Revival style, with walls of red tapestry brick, and a low hipped roof covered with green Ludovici tile. Its lower floor opened to the lake and was largely given over to an \\"aquatic room\\" to serve canoeists and skaters; the upper floor contained lavatories at the ends, separated by a wide \\"rest room\\" finished in oak and furnished with easy chairs and popular magazines. The building now houses the Rhode Island Watercolor Society and serves as a gallery. It is also used for various seasonal events such as Pawtucket's Winter Wonderland. * Bandstand: Also erected during the building campaign of 1917, the bandstand was erected at the opposite end of the pond from the Potter Casino. Of granolithic composition construction, the bandstand is in the form of a circular open temple, 24' in diameter, with ten columns carrying a steel dome and tile roof. The dome's underside is sheathed in quartered oak, and the temple's frieze carries the names of ten famous composers. The location of the new bandstand, and the layout of the paths leading to it, were determined in consultation with John C. Olmsted, nephew and former partner of the more famous Frederick Law Olmsted. * Park Superintendent's house: A story-and-a-half cottage, built for the Daggett family about 1874, was remodeled in the early twentieth century to serve as offices for the Parks department. * Cogswell Fountain: Located in the triangle at the Newport Avenue entrance. Its shaft of polished gray granite once bore aloft a bronze stork while pure water gushed from the carved figures at each side of its triangular base, the fountain was presented to the citizens of Pawtucket and Central Falls by Dr. Henry D. Cogswell in 1880, and was originally set up in front of the Miller Block at the corner of Main and Mill Streets, (now Main Street and Roosevelt Avenue). The fountain was relocated to Oak Grove Cemetery for a brief period before it was finally transferred to Slater Park about 1904. In 1990 it was returned to its original spot at Main Street and Roosevelt Avenue.

History  By 1906, the southern portions of Queen Anne Hill were already well connected to downtown Seattle by streetcar routes, but portions of the hill remained relatively inaccessible. The local community club approached the Parks Board to propose a scenic route ringing the hill. The Park Board was not initially enthused. The proposed route was not part of the then recently developed \\"Olmsted Plan\\" for Boulevards and Parkways, and the proposed route along standard city streets did not seem to offer the width that had been established as a standard for boulevards, to allow park-like landscaping. On the other hand, nearly the entire route offered spectacular views. A deal was struck: the community would agree to pay for the private property that would have to be obtained to widen the streets (including land that would need to be filled or excavated); City Engineer R. H. Thomson would be responsible for contracts and would deal with any necessary regrading of cross streets; the boulevard would eventually be transferred to the jurisdiction of the Park Department, which would landscape and surface the street. A 1907 ordinance authorized this plan and in 1908 it was incorporated into the Olmsted Plan,Florence K. Lentz and Mimi Sheridan, Queen Anne Historic Context Statement , prepared for the Seattle Department of Neighborhoods, Historic Preservation Program and the Queen Anne Historical Society, October 2005, p. 10. Accessed online 24 July 2008. but in 1910 the project was still mired in lawsuits over land condemnation. Part of Queen Anne Boulevard can be seen here, running just inside the West Queen Anne walls The transfer to the Park Department occurred in 1911; work finally began, and was completed in 1916. Maples, sycamores, oaks, elms, cottonwoods, chestnuts and other trees were planted along the route. This combination of roadway and park, vistas and improved transportation to privately owned land, was not a complete success. New construction impeded many of the views (as did the trees); tree roots attacked sewer lines; sidewalks heaved up to irregular angles as trees outgrew parking strips and shaded houses and yards more than was generally considered desirable. The Parks Department did approve some tree removals, always at the expense of the adjacent landowner. In 1942 the roads (but not the landscaping) were transferred from Parks to the City Engineer's office. A 1952 proposal by the City Engineer and the Planning Commission to revert the route to \\"standard\\" street status was turned down by the City Council.  Current Use  Houses on 7th Avenue West along Queen Anne Boulevard offer a contrast of old and new. Parks and Engineering continue each to have responsibilities relative to the boulevard, resulting in occasional inter-departmental squabbling. Nonetheless, the boulevard continues to be recognized as a vital part of the Queen Anne neighborhood, \\"The Crown of Queen Anne\\", an \\"urban trail and needed recreational amenity ‚Ä¶ appreciated by many Queen Anners and visitors for a diverse variety of uses\\" both for \\"automobile access to Upper Queen Anne neighborhoods\\" and as \\"a recreational and aesthetic amenity‚Ä¶ used at all hours‚Ä¶ The Boulevard offers shade in the summer, beautiful autumn color in the fall, and an open and sunny landscaped path in the winter.\\"Queen Anne Plan Draft Planning Recommendations (April 1998) Prepared by the City of Seattle Interdepartmental Review and Response Team.

Through his varied commercial ventures, he became the wealthiest person in Newport, Rhode Island, in British America. In 1761 and 1762, Lopez unsuccessfully sued the Colony of Rhode Island for citizenship. Early life Duarte Lopez was born in 1731 in Lisbon, Portugal. He belonged to a family of conversos, ethnically Jewish people who had converted to Catholicism, although the family continued to practice Judaism in secret. In 1750 Lopez married a woman named Anna, and within two years the couple had a daughter, Catherine. Aaron's older brother Jos√© had left Portugal years earlier, reclaimed his Jewish identity, and taken the name Moses. Moses was naturalized in 1740 and granted a license by the General Assembly to make potash in 1753, and he became a successful merchant in Newport.Schappes, p. 573, citing Morris A. Gutstein, The Story of the Jews of Newport (New York: Block Publishing Co., 1936), pp. 55, 306. In 1752 Duarte and his family moved to Newport, where they too reclaimed their Jewish identities and became Aaron, Abigail, and Sarah.Kaplan, p. 13. Business Lopez's wife and her son Joshua Lopez, painted by Gilbert Stuart Lopez established himself as a shopkeeper in Newport shortly after his arrival. By 1755 he was buying and selling goods throughout Rhode Island and dealing with agents in Boston and New York.Kaplan, p. 18. One of Lopez's early business interests was the trade-in spermaceti, a coveted wax extracted from whale oil used to make elegant candles. Lopez built a candle-making factory in Newport in 1756. By 1760, a dozen competitors had built similar plants in New England. Whalers couldn't supply the factories with enough spermaceti to meet the demand, and the price of whale oil was climbing. In 1761, Lopez joined eight other merchants to form a trust to control the cost and distribution of whale oil.Kaplan, pp. 18‚Äì19. Lopez expanded his trade beyond the North American coastline and by 1757 had major interests in the West Indian trade.Schappes, p. 58. He also sent ships to Europe and the Canary Islands.Kaplan, p. 19. Between 1761 and 1774, Lopez was involved in the slave trade.Friedman, pp. 123‚Äì127. Historian Eli Faber determined Lopez underwrote 21 slave ships during a period in which Newport sent a total of 347 slave ships to Africa.Faber, p. 138. By the beginning of the American Revolution, Lopez owned or controlled 30 vessels, engaged in the European and West-Indian trade and in whale-fisheries. Jacobs, et al., p. 294. By the early 1770s, Lopez had become the wealthiest person in Newport; his tax assessment was twice that of any other resident.Pencak, p. 88. The reason he was successful was that his business interests were so diverse. He manufactured spermaceti candles, ships, barrels, rum, and chocolate. He had business interests in the production of textiles, clothes, shoes, hats, and bottles.Kaplan, p. 21. Ezra Stiles, the Congregational minister in Newport and future president of Yale College, described Lopez as \\"a merchant of the first eminence\\" and wrote that the \\"extent of [his] commerce probably [was] surpassed by no merchant in America\\".Marcus and Saperstein, p. 94. In the mid-1770s, with growing tensions between Britain and its American colonies, Lopez's fortunes began to decline. The Continental Association enforced a boycott against trade with Britain. In October 1775, the British navy anchored outside Newport's harbour and the population began to evacuate the city. In early 1776 Lopez relocated to Portsmouth, Rhode Island, then to Providence, Boston, and finally to Leicester, Massachusetts. Historian Marilyn Kaplan describes Lopez's losses during the American Revolution as \\"monumental.\\"Kaplan, p. 22. Philanthropy Lopez supported a number of charitable causes in Newport. He purchased books for the Redwood Library and Athenaeum. He contributed lumber to help build the College in the English Colony of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations (which later relocated to Providence and eventually became Brown University),Pencak, p. 92. and he donated land to establish Leicester Academy in Leicester, Massachusetts. Lopez was a leading contributor who helped build the Touro Synagogue, and he was given the honor of laying one of its cornerstones.Pencak, p. 95. During the American Revolution, Lopez harbored Jewish refugees in his Leicester home. Referring to those sheltered by Lopez, a friend wrote in jest that \\"your family at present are in a number only 99 and still there is room for one more\\".Pencak, p. 100. Citizenship In 1761, Lopez applied to the Rhode Island Superior Court to become a naturalized citizen. Under Britain's Naturalization Act of 1740, any foreign Protestant who had resided in the American colonies for seven years could become a British citizen; while Catholics were excluded by the law, special provisions were allowed for the religious scruples of both Quakers and Jews. Although he met the conditions set by law, Lopez's request was denied.No record of the decision has survived, so the court's rationale is unknown. Feldberg, p. 12. Another qualified Jew, Isaac Elizer, was also denied citizenship.Feldberg, p. 12.Smith and Sarna, p. 3. Lopez and Elizer appealed to the Rhode Island General Assembly. The lower house approved their request and required that the men return to the Superior Court to take an oath of allegiance, but the terms of their citizenship would be limited: Jews could become citizens of Rhode Island, but they would not be allowed to vote or serve in public office.Feldberg, pp. 12-13. Lopez and Elizer fared worse in the upper house of the legislature. There they were told that Parliament had given the courts, not the legislature, jurisdiction over naturalization. If they wished to become citizens, Lopez and Elizer would have to appeal to the Superior Court.Feldberg, p. 13. The Superior Court heard the pair's appeal on March 11, 1762. Their application was denied a second time. The court reasoned that the 1740 act was intended to increase the population of the colony, and since the colony had grown crowded the law no longer applied. The court also noted that under a 1663 Rhode Island law, only Christians could become citizens.According to Marcus and Saperstein, the law was enacted around 1699, not 1663 (p. 93). Lopez and Elizer could not become citizens of Rhode Island.Marcus and Saperstein, pp. 92‚Äì93. Determined to become a citizen, Lopez made inquiries to learn whether he could become naturalized in another colony. In April 1762 he moved temporarily to Swansea, Massachusetts. On October 15, 1762, Lopez became a citizen of Massachusetts and then returned to Newport. Historians believe Lopez was the first Jew to become a naturalized citizen of Massachusetts.Marcus and Saperstein, p. 92. Death On May 28, 1782, while returning with his family from Leicester to Newport, he drowned when his horse and carriage fell into a pond.Marcus and Saperstein, pp. 94‚Äì95.Pencak, p. 109. He was buried in the Jewish cemetery in Newport.Jacobs, et al., p. 295.Marcus and Saperstein, p. 95.

He captained England three times, and was the first captain to be drawn from the north of England as well as captaining England in the first ever 15-a-side international. Early life Edward Kewley was born in Farnham Royal on 20 June 1852, to Thomas Kewley, curate of Farnham Royal, and his wife Jane. He was educated at Marlborough College and on leaving school he travelled to his father's home county of Lancashire to pursue a career in the cotton industry as a cotton broker. The style of rugby taught at Marlborough in the 1870s favoured kicking and dribbling rather than handling. This was at a time when a number of varying interpretations of the game existed. It was only when the Rugby Football Union was formed in 1871 and began to create uniformity that clubs and schools began to play similar forms. Rugby career Kewley played his rugby for Liverpool Football Club, the world's oldest open rugby club. The club had been founded in 1857 and was aligned to the rugby code rather than association football. It was in no way a predecessor to the association football club, Liverpool F.C.. He was selected as one of the 14 forwards for the fourth ever game against Scotland on 23 February 1874. He missed the next game, the first England-Ireland international on 15 February 1875, but was recalled to play against Scotland on 8 March 1875. He kept his place and in 1877 was selected as captain. His first game as captain was in the landmark match of 5 February 1877 against Ireland at the Oval. This game was the first international following the Law change that reduced the teams to 15 players and thus was the first 15-a-side international. England won the match 2 goals and 2 tries to nil. Kewley went on to captain England twice more against Scotland. He was the first player from the north of England to captain the national side. Kewley later continued to focus much energy on the game after he retired from playing. He encouraged the formation of new clubs and he was made honorary secretary, honorary treasurer and president of Liverpool Football Club. He was also elected to the first committee of the Lancashire County Football Club in 1881Marshall, Francis, Football; the Rugby union game, p378, (1892) (London Paris Melbourne, Cassell and company, limited) and later became president. Additionally, he was elected the fourth vice-president of the RFU. Cricket Kewley not only had the distinction of playing for and captaining his country in rugby. His sporting prowess saw him selected to play for Lancashire as a right-handed batsman. Kewley made his only first-class appearance against Kent in 1875. He scored just three runs with the bat and took one catch during the game. His dedication to rugby diverted him from developing his cricketing career. Personal life Edward Kewley died in Winchester on 17 April 1940.

Large and complex systems are composed of component models; mathematical equations describe the dynamic behavior of the system. Developed by the European company Dassault Syst√®mes, Dymola is available as a standalone product and integrated in 3DEXPERIENCE as part of CATIA. Dymola 2021 supports version 3.4 of the Modelica language and version 3.2.3 of the Modelica Standard Library, as well as versions 1.0 and 2.0 of the Functional Mock-up Interface (FMI). History Dymola was initially designed in 1978 by Hilding Elmqvist, for his PhD thesis at Lund Institute of Technology (later part of Lund University). This first version of Dymola was based on the Dynamic Modeling Language (also called Dymola) and was implemented in Simula 67. Later it was re-implemented in Pascal and C++. In 1992, Elmqvist created the Swedish company Dynasim AB to continue the development of Dymola. In 2006, Dassault Syst√®mes acquired Dynasim AB and started to integrate Dymola in CATIA. In 1996, Elmqvist initiated the Modelica design effort. The goal was to develop an object-oriented language for modeling of technical systems to reuse and exchange dynamic system models in a standardized format. Modelica is based on the Dymola language, but the experience with other modeling languages have been taken into account. In September 1997, version 1.0 of the Modelica specification was released which was the basis for a prototype implementation within Dymola. In year 2000, the non-profit Modelica Association was formed to manage the continually evolving Modelica language and the development of the free Modelica Standard Library. Since 2002, only the Modelica language is supported in Dymola. Application domains Dymola has multi-engineering capabilities which mean that models can consist of components from many engineering domains. Using the Modelica language, sub-systems are represented by interconnected components; at the lowest level dynamic behavior is described by mathematical equations or algorithms. Connections between components form additional equations. Dymola processes the complete system of equations in order to generate efficient simulation code. Domain-specific knowledge is represented by Modelica libraries, containing components for mechanical, electrical, control, thermal, pneumatic, hydraulic, power train, thermodynamics, vehicle dynamics, air conditioning, etc. For commercial libraries Dymola supports information hiding and encryption. Typical application areas which are facilitated by Modelica libraries include: =Automotive= The automotive applications fall into three main categories. The engine and drive train are modeled using the Engines and Powertrain libraries. The flexibility of the open Modelica language is particularly suitable for modeling hybrid or alternative drive trains using the Battery, Brushless DC Drives and Electrified Powertrains libraries. Modal bodies or flexible shafts are available through the Flexible Bodies library. Engine and battery cooling is supported by the Cooling library, which can be combined with the HVAC library. The Human Comfort library adds models of occupant comfort for complete vehicle thermal modeling. Controller components are available in the Modelica Standard Library. The hierarchically structured, open-source, Modelica models offer unprecedented flexibility for multiple vehicle configurations while reusing common components. =Aerospace and Defense= A multitude of libraries offer the capacity to model the complex thermo-fluid systems of aircraft, ranging from fuel systems to environmental control. The Human Comfort library provides additional models of occupant comfort for cabin thermal modeling. The Flight Dynamics library enables the rapid modeling, simulation and analysis of the flight dynamic characteristics of a wide range of aircraft and UAVs. Actuators for flight control and other subsystems use the Brushless DC Drives and Electrified Powertrains libraries. Flexible beams and modal bodies from Finite Element models are managed by the Flexible Bodies library. =Energy, Process and Utilities= Ever more stringent requirements on environmental impact drive the trend towards more detailed modeling of physics and control systems. The Heat, Ventilation and Air Conditioning (HVAC) library allows you to minimize building HVAC operating costs by selecting the correct system control strategy and avoid costly HVAC system design errors early in the building design process. The Human Comfort Library provides an integrated approach to simulate the thermal comfort within an occupied building or vehicle. Thermo- fluid system are typically modeled with the ThermalSystem library. The Industrial Process Simulation library is focused on paper and pulp industries. =Industrial Equipment= All kinds of industrial equipment can be modeled using the mechanical libraries of the Modelica Standard Library, including 3D multi-body systems. Other options are flexible beams and modal bodies originating from a Finite Element model. Actuators and control systems are modeled with Battery, Brushless DC Drives and Electrified Powertrains libraries. The thermal properties of industrial machinery are easily modeled with the Cooling library. =Third-party libraries= In addition to the libraries available in the Dymola product portfolio, several libraries have been developed by third parties, such as, Claytex , Modelon AB , TLK-Thermo and XRG Simulation . Additional free and commercial libraries are available on the Modelica Association homepage . Tools and interoperability =Model design tools= The Model Calibration option is based on a process where measured data from a real device is used to tune parameters such that the simulation results are in good agreement with the measured data. The Design Optimization option is used to tune parameters of a device or its controller to improve system dynamics for multiple criteria and multiple cases. The Model Management includes support for encryption of models, version control from Dymola and utilities for checking, testing and comparing models. Also included is support for common version management tools, such as CVS, SVN and GIT. =Code and model export= For most steps during system development (dimensioning, detailed design, implementation), it is important to have access to a C code image of the model to run hardware in the loop, rapid prototyping simulations or to build simulators for validation or training purposes. Several options are available to achieve those activities. Dymola supports import and export according to the Functional Mockup Interface (FMI). With appropriate options the exported code can be generated for export without any run-time license, or as source code. The exported Functional Mockup Units can then be used on several simulation platforms.

Childhood  Albert Asriyan was born in Baku, Azerbaijan SSR on June 28, 1951, to an Armenian family, as the first of three children. Albert's father, Mikhail Asriyan was a circus administrator and his mother, Sirvart Karnezian-Asriyan, a housewife. Growing up in a tough neighborhood in Baku, Albert was enrolled in music school at age 7 where he majored in classical violin and classical piano. After graduating from music school with honors at age 15, in 1966 he was accepted to the Azerbaijan State Musical College Asaf Zeinally, where he majored in classical violin and piano. During his studies at Zeinally, Asriyan developed a love for jazz. Purchasing bootleg copies of jazz greats such as Louis Armstrong, Ella Fitzgerald, Billie Holiday, Dizzy Gillespie, Duke Ellington, and performing at local gigs in youth music group Chaika (English: Seagull), as well as in Volshebniye Zvuki (English: Magic Sounds). At the same time, Asriyan picked up the guitar and began studying by listening to Santana. In 1971, Asriyan entered the Baku Academy of Music majoring in classical violin and minoring in piano/music composition. His talent as a composer and arranger always found use in conservatory \\"Kapustnik\\" (English: Musical Comedy Club). During his years at the conservatory, Asriyan also played on the conservatory basketball team. He graduated in 1976 and turned professional.  Career in Baku After graduating from the conservatory, Asriyan joined the USSR Navy where he became a part of the Orchestra of the Red Banner Caspian Navy as a violinist and guitarist. In 1977 he joined the Jazz Band of the Philharmonic Society of Baku in the groups Sevgilim (English: Loved one) and AzConcert's \\"Ashugi\\" (English: Poets in Love). During this time he performed in Azerbaijan and other republics of the Soviet Union. Aside from Soviet music, the groups performed many popular foreign songs such as that of James Brown and Chick Corea, despite controversy and strict disapproval of the music committee. With his friends and colleagues Elkhan Shikhaliev saxophonist/composer/arranger/vocalist, Siyavush Kerimi oud/keyboars, Rauf Sultanov bass, Ramin Sultanov drums, Mukhtar Yakhyayev keyboards, Yuriy Tagiev vocals, Karen Avanesyan (entertainer, comedian, actor) and other musicians, Asriyan toured all over the USSR. From 1979-1983 he was one of the first violins of Azerbaijan Radio and TV Symphonic Orchestra conducted by Ramiz Melik Aslanov. During this time he also performed with several pop-groups and was the band leader of group Bakinskiye Devushki (English: Girls of Baku) where in 1979 he met his future wife Ivetta Mirzoyan, a singer and guitarist of the girls group. Asriyan and Ivetta went on to play together in pop-group Muleili. On April 21, 1980, they married, and had a daughter, Julie Anna, in 1983. In 1983 Asriyan became an arranger and keyboard player for the pop/folk group Ashugi. From 1984-1989 he was the arranger/ keyboarding/ violinist/ jazz vocalist of the State Orchestra Gaya (English: Mountain), conducted by Teymur Mirzoyev. Within Gaya formed a rock-group Talisman where Asriyan and his friend Elkhan Shikhaliev wrote and performed most of their compositions. He was the artistic leader of the group up to August, 1989. Talisman became a very well known and successful band, performing at the XII World Festival of Youth and Students in Moscow-1985. In 1986 Asriyan with \\"Gaya\\" and \\"Talisman\\" traveled to Kabul, Afghanistan to perform for the Soviet troops fighting in the war. The band also performed at major events such as the Rock Panorama of Baku-1988, Concert for the USSR government at Republic Concert Hall-Lenin Sarai in Baku, The State Central Concert Hall Russia in Moscow, Column Hall of the House of Unions at the Kremlin, as well as all over the country and outside. Asriyan's song Bez Tebya (English: Without You), to which Ivetta wrote the lyrics, was performed at the 1987 International Music Festival in J≈´rmala. The video to his song \\"Kuvshin\\" (English: Vase), directed by Sevinc Kerimova, became one of the first music videos to hit television in Azerbaijan and former USSR. Asriyan's songs were performed on television. Bez Tebya was performed at the New Year's Eve Celebrations of 1987-1988 in Baku and Fakir performed at the Song of the Year Annual Contest of USSR in Baku, 1987. His song \\" 80 thousand roses\\" was performed by Talisman at concerts and patriotic festivals in memory of World War 2. Asriyan was also the composer and performer for Azerbaijan TV Show Molodejnaya Estrada (Youth Stage) in 1979-1982, and for televised concert of Masters of Arts of Azerbaijan of 1988-1989. His song Kuvshin was the closing number.  Career in Moscow  In 1989, due to civil conflict in Baku and after several attacks from the Azeri extremists, Asriyan moved with his family to Moscow, with the help of friends, where they lived from 1989 to 1993. Upon invitation of his childhood friend and colleague, composer Boris Vishnevkin, Asriyan became a part of the Jewish group Shabas and performed all over the former USSR. Together they recorded an album in Moscow. Asriyan performed solo with his own violin show for various events, and performed Armenian folk music with other musicians. On December 25, 1990 Albert and Ivetta had their second daughter, Kristina. Asriyan applied for entry to the USA with his extended family as refugees; they were granted entry in 1993.  Career in the United States  On July 13, 1993, Asriyan and family arrived in New York City. Asriyan and his wife began to study English at a local school, and he performed at a local restaurant/club, Kavkaz (Caucasus). Asriyan performed for the Russian-speaking community in the US, along with Boka ‚Äì Boris Davidian (vocalist), Karen Avanesyan (comedian, actor) and Igor Mirzoyan (clarinet), when they were visiting the US. Asriyan became involved with the Diocese of the Armenian Church of America, volunteering to be the musical entertainment for all Church events. As part of the committee of the Russian-Armenian Church community, Albert directed the musical programs, concerts, and child/adult performances. The youth church group performed at several events, representing Armenian culture at live annual festivals including NYANA-New York Association for New Americans, Summer Armenian Festivals in New Rochelle, at St. Nersess Seminary, NY, St. Vartan Armenian Cathedral in New York, NY, Holy Martyrs Armenian Church Bayside Queens, NY, St. Mary Armenian Apostolic Church in New Jersey. Asriyan was awarded Certificates of Appreciation from the Primate, Archbishop Khajag Barsamian. In 1996 Asriyan set up his own entertainment program, Albert's Show Orchestra, consisting of Albert Asriyan (artistic leader, violinist, vocalist, keyboardist, arranger, composer), his wife, Ivetta Asriyan (vocalist, songwriter), Robert Toniev (vocalist, keyboardist), Levon Mnatsakanian (vocalist), Arthur Gesiyan (guitar), Lev Yelisavetski (vocalist/keyboard), Eduard Kurchakov (saxophone), Isabelle-Bella Khanuka (vocalist) and other musicians. In 2000, Asriyan's daughters Julie Anna and Kristina, whom Albert had enrolled in music studies since childhood, joined Albert's Show Orchestra. Asriyan was invited to perform at private and public events all over the US. He worked at several Russian clubs/restaurants in Brooklyn. In 2000, Asriyan's musical instruments and stage equipment burned in a restaurant fire in Brighton Beach, Brooklyn. The fire destroyed his old Italian handmade violin, on which he had played since youth, and his collection of music recordings, music books, lyrics and notes. With the help of friends and family, he was able to purchase new instruments, keyboards, violins, and stage equipment; returning to the stage soon after. From 2000, Asriyan worked as a violin and guitar teacher at the International Children's Center For Performing Arts in Brooklyn, NY, as a private teacher, and as a consultant and arranger/composer for a children's string orchestra conducted by his sister Ruzanna Akopjan (–†—É–∑–∞–Ω–Ω–∞ –ê–∫–æ–ø–¥–∂–∞–Ω), in New Jersey. Asriyan was also the arranger/songwriter/music consultant for Allegretto Music and Art Studio run by his sister-in-law Ida Melik-Mirzakhan (–ò–¥–∞ –ú–µ–ª–∏–∫-–ú–∏—Ä–∑–∞—Ö–∞–Ω), with whom he wrote several songs. In 2005, Asriyan and Ida composed a requiem A moment of Silence to the lyrics of his niece Victoriya Melik-Mirzakhan and poetry of Ivetta and Ida's father Alexandr J. Mirzoyan. The requiem was performed by Ivetta (vocals), Igor Mirzoyan (clarinet and Armenian duduk), and Karine Kocharyan (Armenian poetry reading). Ardzagank Armenian TV created a video to the requiem which was broadcast nationally. The requiem was dedicated to Ida's son Alexander, who had been killed in an automobile accident at age 20 in 2003. Asriyan enrolled his daughters into multiple music and art schools for music, dance and the performing arts. Asriyan and Ivetta's song Zvezdopad (Russian: –ó–≤–µ–∑–¥–æ–ø–∞–¥, English: Star Falls) performed by their daughter Kristina was entered into the Russian-American song-writing competition Moya Pesnya (Russian: –ú–æ—è –ü–µ—Å–Ω—è, English: My Song) broadcast on Russian-American TV station RTVI and Russian Davidzon Radio Station in 2006. Kristina was the winner, and 2006 Artist of the Year of the Our Talented Children competition (Russian: –ö–æ–Ω–∫—É—Ä—Å –ù–∞—à–∏ –¢–∞–ª–∞–Ω—Ç–ª–∏–≤—ã–µ –î–µ—Ç–∏). Asriyan accompanied Kristina at her solo performance of Summertime, by George Gershwin, at the Merkin Concert Hall at Kaufman Center in New York City, on March 25, 2007. Asriyan and Ivetta released several albums of their own music as well as Russian and Armenian music, including violin classics of Albert's Show, which were distributed among the Russian-Armenian community in the tri-state area. On November 22, 2007 Asriyan was invited to Davidzon Radio Station- program Karavan for their Thanksgiving Day celebration to talk about his life, career, music, and plans.  Death  Less than a week from his radio interview, on November 27, 2007, Asriyan became ill and was taken to the Coney Island Hospital in Brooklyn, NY. He died on November 28, 2007, at the age of 56. The New York Daily News published an article about Albert Asriyan on December 7, 2007, reflecting on his life and contribution to music.

The parish originally served 70 households. The Parish elementary school was opened in 1924. The parish eventually expanded to include a rectory, convent, kindergarten, lower school, junior high school, day care center, parish hall and the two churches. The school, which reached a peak enrollment of 1,586 students in 1964, closed on June 15, 2012 with a final enrollment of 280 students. As of 2019, the church served 1,830 households totaling 5,080 people and Mass attendance currently averages 1,300 people, spread among the 8 Sunday Masses. History =The 1920s & 30s - the beginnings of the parish= In the early part of the 20th century, the area currently comprising Saint William Parish in the Archdiocese of Philadelphia, made up of the communities of Lawndale and the Northern part of Crescentville, was part of Presentation BVM Parish in nearby Cheltenham, Pennsylvania which was under the leadership of Rev. William A Motley. When the Diocese began planning for a new parish in the developing part of Lower Northeast Philadelphia, Archbishop Dennis Dougherty asked Rev. Motley if he wished to remain at Presentation or would he like to lead a new parish?...his answer was clear and on January 20, 1920, St. William Parish was officially founded under Motley's leadership named in honor of the Hermit; William of Vercelli. Immediately, a worship location was secured at the Germania Maennerchor Hall (**) at 514 Devereaux Ave with the first mass being held on Jan 23.\\"Foundations,\\" in \\"A brief overview of our parish history.\\" Philadelphia, Pennsylvania: St. William Roman Catholic Church (website), retrieved online February 17, 2019. The new Parish comprising 70 families, spread out within the boundaries of; Cottman Ave to the North, Tookany Creek to the West and Roosevelt Boulevard to the South and East. A Rectory was established at 415 Levick Street that included a small chapel. In 1922, a move to 909 Levick street would be prompted by need for additional space. (**) Some 60 years later, this same building was bought by the Parish and converted into the parish day care center. It was sold in 1999. In 1921, ground was broken for the combination Church/School at Rising Sun Avenue and Robbins Street. Built of local Bethayres stone. It was dedicated on Nov 27, 1921 by Bishop Michael Crane.\\"Buildings,\\" in \\"A brief overview of our parish history,\\" St. William Roman Catholic Church (website). In 1923, the parishes of St. Ambrose and - St Martin Of Tours were established which ate up a large portion of St. William's Southern and Eastern parts. New (and current) boundaries were Magee Ave to the North, Phila/Mont.Co Twnshp Line/Philadelphia, Newtown and New York Railroad/Newtown Branch of the Reading Railroad Company to the West, the Oxford Branch of the Pennsylvania Railroad now Pennway Street/Air line through the Naval Supply Depot to the East and Allengrove Street To the South. In 1924, the St. William elementary school opened for 100 students under the direction of the Sisters of the Servants of the Immaculate Heart of Mary order. The two sisters commuted from St. Joachim's Parish in Frankford each day and converted the church interior for school use during the week, using the pews as desks and kneelers as seats. In 1925, fundraising was begun to build additions to the chapel/school, and by 1929 two additional floors were built to the existing building to give a total of 12 classrooms for the 450 students. The Chapel was eventually converted into a hall, once the new church was completed. This addition to the school was dedicated on October 5, 1930 by Cardinal Dougherty. A new \\"basement church\\" was constructed closer to Devereaux Avenue, completed in 1927, also of Bethayres stone construction with a traditional gothic look on the interior. The Main Church was to be built atop this structure once enough funds were raised and other 'priority building' was completed. A new Rectory was also built in 1927. In 1948, construction was begun on a new convent building. Up to this time the Sisters had been housed in a group of row homes behind the Lower School on Robbins Street where the current Memorial Hall now stands.\\"Rectory\\" and \\"Convent,\\" in \\"A brief overview of our Parish history.\\" Philadelphia, Pennsylvania: St. William Roman Catholic Church (website), retrieved online February 17, 2019. Most of the buildings of the Parish built between 1920 and 1948 were designed by the Henry D. Dagit & Sons Firm. =The 1940s and World War II= During this time, as the country was in the midst of the Second World War, people who lived in St William sold war bonds, collected scrap metals, served as civilian air raid wardens, and grew food on available land. In May 1943 a party was conducted under the Holy Name Society for returning service personnel from the parish. Twelve men killed in the war were honored with a bronze plaque at a special mass on May 30 of that same year. 317 names appeared on the Roll of Honor of St. William parishioners who served in the armed forces during World War II. =The 1950s and 60s ‚Äì times of change, and growth= The postwar years of the 1950s and '60s saw many changes come to the physical plant of the Parish that reflected the housing boom of the area, the economic upswing of the times and the growing parish population. Many of the original \\"Motley Buildings\\" were completely replaced. The Middle School (Junior High/Upper School) building was built and later an additional floor was added. When consideration was had for the completion of the Upper Church, it was found that the basement church was not structurally sufficient to support additional construction. In 1955, the old church was demolished to make way for the current granite and sandstone building designed by the Gleeson & Mulrooney Architectural firm. The first mass was said in the new church (lower) on December 25, 1956.\\"Buildings,\\" in \\"A brief overview of our parish history,\\" St. William Roman Catholic Church (website). This Church, now the parish's third, seated 1,000. All of the stained glass windows and some appointments were used from the second church. While structurally complete the parish was still without a \\"Main Church\\" as construction debts prohibited completion of the interior of the Upper Church (seating 1,250) until June 1963. In 1965 with school enrollment now at over 1500, plans were drawn up for a new school building with 12 classrooms to be built behind the Lower School on Robbins, again where Memorial Hall now stands. A fire in early 1966 that destroyed the Rectory shelved those plans and the building was never built. A temporary Rectory was established at 6145 Argyle Street. The current Rectory was completed in 1967. All substantial changes to the parish physical plant were during the 24-year reign of Father William Boyle - a quiet, deeply religious man, a strong administrator well liked and commonly known by parishioners as \\"The Builder.\\" It was also during his administration that the parish population nearly tripled in size. =The 1970s ‚Äì prosperity= The 1970s were relatively quiet construction years for the parish but that's not to say they were not busy ones. The most notable \\"beginning\\" during this time was the Parish Carnival, started by Fr. Kimble in 1974. As a source of funds for expansion and maintenance of the Parish facilities, the Carnival would last for well over a decade with its largest year being in 1986, when over $50,000 was netted from this week-long event. The Carnival had had its last hurrah when the decision was made to construct a much needed hall in 1988 which took up half the grounds used for the event. It was also under the leadership of Fr. Kimble, that the Home and School Association, the CYO, the Boy Scout Troop, and the St. William Senior Citizen's Club were all either started or reestablished in the Parish. =The 1980s ‚Äì renewed growth= In 1980 James E. Mortimer became St William's 6th pastor, a post he would hold for 22 years.Cook, Bonnie L. \\"Msgr. James E. Mortimer, 91, former pastor at Church of St. William in Lawncrest\\" (obituary). Philadelphia, Pennsylvania: The Inquirer, February 6, 2019. In 1981 school tuition fees were established with minimum weekly payments required from parents. During his tenure several refurbishments were carried out, in many cases with help from parishioners. In 1986 the Kindergarten Building was completed entirely by parish volunteers and the \\"St. William Creche\\" dedicated. A case, it built in the Narthex of the Upper Church to house wooden statues for the Nativity, Resurrection and Crucifixion, that were carved by parishioner Gregor Betz.Photo of Monsignor James Mortimer in St. William's new kindergarten classroom (photo with caption). Philadelphia, Pennsylvania: The Inquirer, November 22, 1987, p. 518; subscription required). In 1988 \\"Memorial Hall\\" at Robbins and Argyle was completed at a cost of $1.25 million and dedicated by Archbishop Bevilacqua. In 1989 The Adoration Chapel was opened, dedicated to Mother Katherine Drexel. It is behind the Lower Church Altar with entrance off Argyle Street. The vacant Annex of the old Lawndale Hospital (now Kindred Hospital) at 6200 Palmetto Street was purchased and provided 14 additional classrooms in 1993.Cook, \\"Msgr. James E. Mortimer, 91, former pastor at Church of St. William in Lawncrest,\\" The Inquirer.\\" It was known as the Primary School. Eenrollment at this time was over 1,300 but shortly after this building opened, the numbers started to drop. Mortimer organised quite elaborate decorations for the various holidays over the years. One most public display, that continues in form to this day, is the Christmas light display with every parish building and tree lit up over the holiday. =The 1990s ‚Äì at 75 years, the parish peaks= By the early 1990s, the Parish, which had started off seventy years earlier with 70 families in a small room, was now a complex of nine buildings and two large churches. Over 9,600 parishioners were on the register and attendance at the Sunday masses was over 4,500 people. In 1995, the Parish celebrated its 75th anniversary. Starting in the mid-90s, white flight began to take hold on the Lower Northeast. The German, Irish, Polish and Italian make up of the parish was being augmented by Hispanic, Asian and African Americans who were moving into the community. The Parish welcomed the newcomers. Still, registration dropped to 8,900 by 1997 then down to just over 7,000 by 2002. School enrollment dropped from 1,100 in 1997 to just over 700 in 2002. According to Kathleen McDonough, who grew up in the area, Mortimer actively welcomed new arrivals from different ethnic backgrounds, including priests and members of the congregation from Hispanic and South Asian backgrounds. \\\\- Opinion Though major change was taking place, St. William parish was listed as one of the top 300 parishes in the US in the book \\"Excellent Catholic Parishes: The Guide to Best Places and Practices\\" in 2001. St William was one of three parishes in the Diocese and the only parish within the City of Philadelphia to receive this recognition. =The 2000s ‚Äì renewal= In 2002, Msgr. Mortimer retired and Msgr. Nelson Perez, now Bishop Nelson J. Perez, was installed as the 7th Pastor of St William.Kosich, John. \\"Bishop Nelson J. Perez prepares to take over Diocese of Cleveland.\\" Cleveland, Ohio: ABC News5, September 4, 2017. According to Kathleen McDonough, who grew up in the area, Perez actively welcomed new arrivals from different ethnic backgrounds. Bonnie Coccagna recalled that the then-mostly white congregation felt anxiety as Perez actively spoke about the influx of non-white people into the neighborhood and tolerating people who are sinning. While the young Msgr. Perez came into a parish full of life and vigor, he also came into a parish burdened with major debt of over a half million dollars and a physical plant neglected. During his time, over $360,000 in repairs were made to the various buildings, including repair of the heating systems for both churches, repairs to the air conditioning in the Lower Church (the Upper Church does not have A/C), stone re-pointing, repainting the Lower Church (led by the Parish's Scout Troop), plaster & paint repairs to the Upper Church, replacement of the sound systems in both churches, replacement of the Convent heating system, repair and reconstruction of an entire corner of the Lower School building, replacement of roofs on both school buildings. Through the generosity of a local company, an alarm system was installed in the church, new carpeting was installed in the Lower Church, along with new seats for the Chapel. The Primary School (Hospital Annex) was closed and the building leased out to the Sisters of the IHM for a Ministry Center for a period of 5 years. The debt that welcomed the Msgr. Perez at the door was reduced significantly, bills were brought current, and a treasury was established. This could not have been accomplished without the dedication of the Parishioners of St William. Their generosity of time, talent and treasure given to the Parish has always been unmatched. On January 12, 2009, Msgr. Perez was assigned as Pastor of St. Agnes Parish, in West Chester, Pa. In his place, St William Parish welcomed the Reverend Scott Brockson as Pastoral Administrator. Fr. Brockson, formerly Pastor of St. Hugh's in North Philadelphia, would hold this temporary position until news came in May 2009 of the assignment of Fr. Joseph G. Watson as the 8th Pastor of St. William Parish. Fr. Watson, a graduate of St. William School, was ordained in 1992 and had served as Pastor of St. Charles Borromeo Parish at 20th and Christian Sts., in South Philadelphia prior to his assignment to St. Wililam. Fr. Watson served St. William Parish until June 20, 2016, when he was reassigned as pastor of Nativity of Our Lord in Warminster PA. Fr. Scott Brockson remained at St William Parish as an assistant along with Fr. Skip Miller until their new parish assignments took effect in June 2010. Fr Scott took over as Pastor of St. Augustine in Bridgeport and Fr. Skip became a Parochial Vicar for nearby St. Cecilia Parish in Fox Chase. Fr. Dominic Ishaq served at St. William as a Part-Time Parochial Vicar and Coordinator of the Pakistani Community of the Diocese, from 2004 until 2015. =The 2010s ‚Äì change and consolidation= With changes and closures to parishes in the Diocese, in 2013, St. William was again blessed with the addition of two more priests serving the parish, for a total of 4 priests residing in the Rectory. Fr. Augusto \\"Gus\\" Concha was assigned to reside and serve the Hispanic Community of the Parish, and also serve the Hispanic Community of St. Helena Parish in Olney. Fr. Gus officially retired on June 20, 2016, and remains as a Retired Priest in Residence at St. William, where his brother Fr. Alfonso \\"Al\\" Concha now serves as pastor. With the coming of the Haitian Community from the closed Incarnation of Our Lord Church (2013), the parish welcomed their Chaplain, Fr. Vilardi. Shortly after his arrival, his order decided to change him to another ministry, and after 8 years of serving the Haitian Population of Philadelphia, they bid farewell to their spiritual leader and welcomed Fr. Alfred Lauricien who now serves the Haitian Community and the Parish. On May 21, 2016, Archbishop Chaput announced the changes for Clergy that included reassigning our Pastor, Fr. Joe Watson, to now serve as Pastor of Nativity of Our Lord Parish in Warminster PA., and that the Reverend Alfonso J. Concha would become the 9th Pastor to serve the Parish of St. William. The official Change took place on June 20, 2016. A fond farewell was held on June 19 for Fr. Watson in Memorial Hall, with over 500 people attending the Noon Mass and the reception that followed. It was also announced that Fr. Tariq Issac would be reassigned from the Diocese of Harrisburg, to serve St. William Parish as a Parochial Vicar and Chaplain of the Pakistani people of the Diocese of Philadelphia. Fr. Issac took up residence at St. William on June 20, 2016. =The parish today= With 8 Masses each Sunday, attendance is still strong, averaging just under 1,300 people with a current registration of over 5,000 people - as of 2019. There are five English Masses (5:00pm vigil, 7:30 & 9:00am, 12:00 and 8:00pm), one Spanish Mass (10:30am), one Pakistani Mass (4:00pm), and one Haitian Mass (5:30pm) celebrated each weekend. The parish offers one of the latest Sunday Masses in the City of Philadelphia (8:00pm) Two daily English Masses (6:00am and noon) see an additional 100 or so people attending each day, many from the surrounding business community as well as from the Navy Depot on Tabor Road. St. William Parish also hosts a weekly Mass on Thursdays for 100 people, and a Sunday Communion Service at the Philadelphia Protestant Home which is a large retirement community within the parish that despite its name, has a significant population of Catholics. Currently, there are 4 priests living in the Parish Rectory, and a dozen Sister Servants of the Immaculate Heart Of Mary living in the Parish Convent. Two Deacons also serve the Parish. =The school= St William School was under the direction of the Sisters of the Immaculate Heart of Mary, nicknamed \\"Macs\\", from its opening in September 1924 until its closing in June 2012. Since opening, enrollment had risen and fallen with the times and the waves of population changes within the parish. Enrollment peaked in 1964, at 1,586, dropped to around 800 by the early 1980s, and peaked again in 1992 at nearly 1,300. St. William School enrollment held around 400 for several of its final years, but started dropping again in 2009. Final enrollment for the 2011-2012 year was just over 280 students. The parish would close the last few fiscal years with an annual operating deficit for the School of around $200,000. For the fiscal year ending 2012, the Parish Church had an operating surplus of $140,000, however the Parish School's operating loss was $340,000, leaving the Parish, as a whole, with an operating shortfall of $200,000. St. William was not alone in the financial struggle to operate a parish school. On January 6, 2012, it was announced that the Diocese would close or consolidate over 40 Catholic Elementary and Secondary schools in the five-county region. Originally, St. William and St. Cecilia's in Fox Chase, 3 miles away, were to merge in September for the School Year 2012-13, forming a new Regional School with a new name and new staff. After a strong appeal by St. Cecilia's to remain an independent parish school, and the request of many St. William Parish families from day one to be able to send their children to Presentation BVM in Cheltenham, just 7 blocks away, it was decided to close St. William School outright, which allowed parents a choice of which local school to attend, yet remain active parishioners of St. William. The Parish must still subsidize each student $800, regardless of the Catholic school chosen, but this is far less of a financial burden, to the parish, compared to running its own school. A Mass of Thanksgiving and Reception was held on Sunday, June 10, 2012, just before the school closed, to celebrate the nearly 88-year history of St. William School. Well over 1,000 people attended the standing room only Mass which was moved to the Lower Church for air conditioning, due to the 90+ degree day. After closure, both school buildings were put up for lease, and then housed Tacony Academy Charter High School until June 2015, when Tacony Academy completed its own building in the Tacony Section of the City. The buildings were again put up for lease and two different schools approached the Parish requesting use of the buildings. St William welcomed MaST II Charter School for the 2016-17/18 school year and continue to remain great tenants. German/Irish heritage of Lawndale and Crescentville The area comprising the section of LawnCrest directly around the Parish church, in the late 19th century, was originally a small German community known to some as Marburg. The community has always had a strong presence of the Protestant Church throughout. In fact, there are no less than 12 well established Protestant (Lutheran, Methodist, Episcopal and Baptist) churches within the physical boundaries of St William Parish, and the oldest Protestant Church in the Lawndale end of the neighborhood dates back to the year 1698. As stated earlier, St. William began its days in the German Men's Chorus Hall (Germania Maennerchor) on Devereaux Ave and was founded as a German Catholic Parish though this fact is not as well known today. The German heritage can be seen throughout the church, with one of the most notable symbols being within in the Lower Church through the Imperial Crown chandeliers with the Iron Cross festooned on each of the 8 sides of each fixture. However, with the post WW2 housing boom of this area seeing a move up of Irish Catholics from the \\"old neighborhoods\\" of North Philadelphia to the Lower Northeast, the latter half of the 20th century saw nearly two-thirds of the neighborhood populace registered at St. William, during which time, LawnCrest was considered a large Catholic Community, commonly, Irish. According to the 1990 Census, there were 15,446 people living within the physical boundaries of the Parish, in 2000, that number jumped to 16,447. Music at St. William Music has always been an integral part of Parish life for now over 100 years and for 60 of those years, was under the Direction of Mary Elizabeth (Betty) Green (B. 10/14/ 1924, D. 4/5/2015). With the current diversity in cultural make up, comes a diversity in the Liturgical Music. Over 50 people make up the present Music Department of the Parish, under the direction of Parishioner and St. William School Graduate, Ken Houser who has served as Director since 2002. This Ministry consists of 3 choir groups with a total of 7 choirs ‚Äî 1 English, 1 Spanish 1 Pakistani and 4 Haitian, and over a dozen professional cantors and 4 Organists/Pianists available for Liturgies. Both Churches are equipped with 2 manual Rodgers Organs installed in 1981 under the direction of famed Philadelphia Organist, Keith Chapman. Piano's are also on hand in both churches. In addition to singing select weekends of each Month, the parish English Choir occasionally visits other parish churches to either combine with or offer completely the services of a Choir for the Liturgy. They have sung on several occasions at St. Martin of Tours, St. Joachim, Holy Innocents, St. Bartholomew & St. Anne Parishes. The parish also has a guitar group and a schola that sings throughout the year for various Masses. The parish has hosted visiting choirs on occasions, such as the Archdiocesan Boys Choir and the St. Augustine Filipino Choir, though this has grown rare in recent years. One Choir, known simply as the \\"Nevilaires\\" is an amazing group of Alumni students from the Overbrook School for the Blind, formerly under the direction of Catherine Deraco and now under the capable direction of Vertner Hines. They traditionally sing for Veterans Day (the closest Sunday to) at the noon Mass in the Lower Church, among other occasions, and are well received. In 2017, a Community Based Concert Series, known as St. William Sunday Concert Series, began hosting local community choirs, ensembles, orchestras and the like for its once monthly concerts. Free and open to the public, the concerts are generally held on the 3rd Sunday of each month at 2:00pm, and rely on the freewill offerings received at each concert. The first concert was held on October 15, 2017 and continued through May 2018, with the 2018-2019 & 2019-2020 seasons successfully booked. Art within Over the years, many parishioners have lent their hand in the creation of the various artifacts that are seen throughout the Parish buildings. Over the past 40 years several noteworthy creations have been given to the parish, restored or updated. =Hand-carved= left As stated earlier, two Parishioners, Gregor Betz and James Gallagher created some of the most seen artifacts in the Parish. In addition to the Creche in the Upper Church Narthex, the Nativity painting seen hung outside of the church, the Last Supper adorning the Lower Church Altar (seen at left) which Mr. Betz carved in 1973, the processional crosses and candles used in both churches, there are other custom works of their art. In the Lower Church are displayed 4 hand carved plaques depicting the sacraments of Baptism, Confirmation, Holy Orders and Anointing of the Sick. He also created 2 addition plaques which hang over the side entrance doors - \\"Creation\\" and \\"Exodus.\\" These were all created by Mr. Gallagher over a period from 1990 to 1992 with a personal story behind each one. While all this work is extremely beautiful, one would certainly not say that they are alone in their \\"one of a kind\\" creations. =Hand-crafted= Centered within those 4 carvings listed above, is the Ambry that contains the Holy Oils. This Ambry, or case, was created and built by Parishioner William O'Donnell and takes the shape of the Church itself to house the 3 oils; the Oil of Catechumens, the Chrism and the Oil of the Sick. Unfortunately, Mr. O'Donnell passed away before he could complete the case and for years, the case hung on the wall of the church \\"as is\\" until the upper portions were completed last year by another parishioner in honor of Mr. O'Donnell. A Parishioner also created the altar on which the tabernacle of the Upper Church now sits, on the Main Altar. Again, a parishioner, in addition to creating the Creche Cabinet itself, created the crucifix that hangs under the baldachin of the Upper Church to hold the life sized Corpus Christi that was given to the parish by another long time Parishioner. =Hand-painted= Mr. Gallagher also created a set of \\"O Antiphons\\" which were hung in the Upper Church for years during Advent. Unfortunately, they were not thought of as significant at the time of their creation and the materials on which they were painted (rolled paper) have not withstood the test of time very well. They remain in delicate state, but selected Antiphons are carefully displayed during Advent and Christmas seasons. Another parishioner took on the task of restoring and repainting the original statues of The Blessed Mother, St. Joseph, The Sacred Heart and St. Anthony that were from the second Church, along with the Pieta in the main vestibule of the church, all of which date to the 1920's. Many of these statues had long been stored away after they were removed from the Lower Church during renovations in 1990, when newer statues were purchased from Italy. The statues that were within the northeast stairwell tower of the Main School were also restored and now adorn the stairwells to the Upper Church Narthex. These statues stood in the original chapel also date from the 1920's. =Shrines= During the Fall of 2015, several statues within the Lower Church were shifted around and two shrines were completely redone by a parishioner. The shrine on the Rectory side of the Church that once housed the 1920s era Statues of St. Francis Xavier and St. Anthony, now houses the Miraculous Medal Shrine, using the original Blessed Mother Statue from the 1920s Church. The Shrine on the Convent side which has housed Our Lady of Fatima for Decades was redone, both shrines include the Scripted Prayers of Each Devotion within the Shrine. The Statues of St. Francis Xavier and St. Anthony were placed on the convent side of the Nave of the church, where the newer Blessed Mother and St. Joseph statues had been since renovations in 1991. Blessed Mother and St Joseph Statues from the 1991 Renovations, now flank the Sanctuary. In early 2016, The Shrines containing the statues of the Risen Christ and St. William of Vercelli, both carved by Gregor Betz, were completely redone by the same parishioner and unveiled following the Easter Vigil. left Se√±or de los Milagros A parishioner from the Hispanic community painted \\"Lord of the Miracles\\", (principal feast day: October 28) as seen to the left, which hangs in the lower church in a hand made frame created in Peru. It is a gift to St. William from the Peruvian people of the parish who make up a very large portion of the local Hispanic community. Each year in October, the Peruvian Community of St. William host a celebration of this feast with a special Mass and procession around the neighborhood in which they carry a palanquin with a much larger version of this painting, on their shoulders, followed by a festival in the hall. With traditional music and prayer, while much smaller, this event is an echo of the same procession that takes place in Lima, Peru each year. This celebration draws hundreds of people of Peruvian descent from all over the Delaware Valley Region for the day-long event.Christian, Gina. \\"Peruvian Catholics celebrate devotion at St. William Parish.\\" Philadelphia, Pennsylvania: Catholic Philly, October 31, 2016. . =Hand-sewn= right right During the pastoral years of Msgr. Mortimer, decoration of the churches for the various liturgical holidays took on an entirely new meaning. In order to accomplish the ideas in his head, Mortimer tapped into the sewing talents of the women of the Parish. Over the course of nearly a decade, women in groups of up to 20 could be found working on projects for Monsignor Mortimer at any given time. Several sets of draperies were made for Easter and Christmas, in addition to other special events, so that a rotation could be had for 3‚Äì4 years without seeing the same thing each year. Each set was designed for the Upper Church, but could easily be adapted for use in the Lower Church. Many of these hand sewn projects can still be seen hanging in the church during these occasions, such as the dark blue drapes that hang in the photographs to the right of the Upper Church and Baldachin, with the individually sewn on silver stars, which is joined by ten panels on which navy blue, light blue and silver fabric was sewn to use as a backdrop for each of the O Antiphons mentioned above that would hang from Advent through Christmas. Of other noteworthy sewing is the set of ten panels of Tulips that are hung at Easter Time in the Nave of the Upper Church as well. There were many other sets made and seen throughout the year. While today, this work may not seem all that unordinary, it was a first in the Diocese and the Parish was known citywide in the 1980s for the elaborate decorations that were seen within. Today, much of it has been scaled back to allow the proper focus on the Liturgical aspect of the Church, vs. elaboration. Many of the women who worked on the creation of these decorations have long since passed on, but several can still be found at Sunday mass, critiquing the work of the newer generations who put up these displays. =Family Circus Comics= St. William Parish displays artwork by Bil Keane, who created the comic strip,Family Circus. Keane was a former student and was inducted into the Archdiocesan Hall of fame in November 1991. During a visit to the Parish in November 1991, he donated several posters that he created that relate to parish and school life. Keane's sketches, including a watercolor self-portrait, hang throughout the school buildings. Stained glass =Lower church= right All of the stained glass windows that are within the Lower Church, are expansions of the windows from the predecessor Gothic style church building that occupied the same site and are of 1920's vintage. It order to fit these windows into the current Church, the blue bands were added to each window. There are 8 sets of 3 windows in the Nave and 4 sets of 2 in the transepts that make up the traditional 12 seen in most churches, which account for the 12 Apostles. The center of each large windows depict several saints, including St. William, St. Peter, St. Charles Borromeo, St. Katherine of Sienna, St. Anne, St Joseph and Our Lady of Perpetual Help. The smaller windows depict Sts. Matthew, Mark, Luke John, Teresa and Bernard. In addition, there is the often unseen \\"hidden windows\\" of the Holy Name Society. Additional windows from the preceding church are found within the Sacristies of both churches. Some of the stained glass windows in the original Lower church were made by a parishioner, William Gibson who was also a desk sergeant at the nearby Second District of the Philadelphia Police, adjacent to the Engine 64 firehouse, where L&I; now has offices. Unfortunately, due to the aforementioned Rectory Fire in 1965, and the loss of many historic files, the details of as to who or what company or person was in charge of designing and creating the stained glass within both churches are unknown at this time. =Upper church= left The windows of the Upper Church, 40 years younger than the Lower Church, are unique but somewhat unadorned in comparison to what would be seen in the \\"Main\\" church of a large parish. The windows are, in fact, significant. From outside the Church in each of the two stairwells leading up to the Narthex of the Upper Church, five windows can be seen, dedicated to the Virgin Mary; a total of 10 windows, ten as in a decade of the Rosary. There are eight additional windows in the Narthex, of which six are hidden behind the Creche, These too are dedicated to Mary. Inside the Upper Church there are the traditional twelve windows, four on each side of the nave and two in each transept. The eight in the nave depict the Eucharistic Prayer as it transpires during the Mass. This is a unique set of windows; the priest's actions during the consecration can be followed in these windows. The Rose window above the choir loft depicts the Holy Spirit shining down upon those who enter the Church. This window faces east; in the morning, when the sun shines brightly through this window it displays its depiction in deep red, gold, golden yellow, bright white and beige.left In the apse, behind the baldachin, are five windows of glass more colorful than the rest, which depict the life of Christ. From left to right they depict the Nativity, Presentation, Crucifixion, Resurrection and Ascension. While the traditional church is built with the altar to the East, St. William is the opposite; this is not uncommon in large cities where land value often determined construction. The current substantial church building cost nearly $450,000 to build in 1955, equivalent to well over four million 2010 dollars. Schools St. William had a parish school which closed in 2012. It closed because of an enrollment decline. St. Cecilia School of Fox Chase, Philadelphia took most of the students while Presentation BVM School in Cheltenham took some.

It supplies gloves, helmets, harness systems, driver's suits, head restraints, shoes and more to racers at local tracks to international teams. It was started by Bill Simpson as Simpson Drag Chutes. History One of Simpson's Manufacturing Facility in New Braunfels, TX In 1958, the 18-year-old Simpson broke both arms in a drag racing crash.Biography at the Motorsports Hall of Fame of America, Retrieved January 8, 2007 Simpson said later, \\"Until then, I was like most drivers. The only time I thought about safety was after I'd been hurt. This time, I was hurt bad enough to do a lot of thinking.\\" Simpson's uncle owned a military surplus store, and suggested that he use a cross-form parachute to slow down the drag car. Simpson rented a sewing machine to create a prototype. Simpson got together with his friend dragster driver Mike Sorokin to test the prototype. They tested it by attaching it to a tow hitch, and dumping it from the back of the Chevy wagon while Sorokin drove down a street at 100 mph. The chute was too big for the car, and the car went airborne and crashed into a tree nursery. Both racers were jailed for the incident, but Simpson Drag Chutes was founded. Jim Donnelly, Muscle Machines 1203 Hot Rod Hero: Bill Simpson The first person to inquire about and use his parachute was \\"Big Daddy\\" Don Garlits. Lori Lovely, \\"Nuvo Safety Spelled S-i-m-p-s-o-n\\" He evolved his business into a number of other safety items, such as gloves, helmets, restraints and shoes. Simpson designed NASA's first umbilical cords, where he met Pete Conrad. Conrad introduced Simpson to DuPont product Nomex in 1967. Simpson used the product to create the first fire suit to be used in racing. He took the suit to the 1967 Indianapolis 500 where it was worn by 30 of 33 drivers. Simpson had developed over 200 racing safety products, including three generations of fire suits. Simpson demonstrated the suit's effectiveness in 1987, when he was set on fire while wearing a suit. Joanne Korth; \\"Bill Simpson is glad to be back\\"; August 21, 2002 St. Petersburg Times To this day, drivers in the NHRA refer to their fire suits as the \\"Simpson Suit,\\" primarily due to the fact that Simpson Performance Products is synonymous with the fire suit, and also, even to this day, the Simpson name still appears on several of the fire suits, including those worn by the NHRA's Safety Safari crews. Usage A Simpson helmet, worn by \\"The Stig\\" Simpson Performance Products racing safety products have been used in many motorsport genres, including IndyCars, NASCAR, and National Hot Rod Association. All International Race of Champions (IROC) cars were fitted with Simpson belts and window nets until the sanctioning body closed. Until 2006, Simpson Performance Products was the only company to supply all of the safety items used in NASCAR racing. NASCAR officials continue to trust Simpson products today. The modern Simpson Performance Products has grown to include a comprehensive line of racing safety products and manufactures some of their products in Texas, North Carolina and California, while other products are manufactured overseas. Simpson has 5 locations which include Indiana, North Carolina, Texas and California. The company was founded in 1959 by Bill Simpson. Simpson safety gear is sold all over the world. A line of Simpson helmets, nicknamed the \\"Star Wars\\" helmet has been in production since 1979. The original model was named the RX-1 (RXM-1 for motorcycle use), then renamed the Model 30 shortly thereafter. The basic design was revised with fewer air slots and renamed the \\"Bandit.\\" A number of different Bandit versions have followed. The similarly designed \\"Diamondback\\" is notably worn by The Stig from the BBC TV Top Gear series. The current Bandit helmet lineup from Simpson includes a Carbon Fiber Bandit, introduced in 2012. The X-Bandit Pro is a full carbon Super Helmet, Snell 2010 and FIA 8860 approved. Simpson‚Äôs U.S. manufacturing facility is located New Braunfels, Texas.

Grant was born in 1970 in Washington, D.C., to Jamaican parents, and spent a large amount of his childhood in the Washington Metropolitan Area. At the age of 21 he attended the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine where he received the Oliver prize for ophthalmological research. His earlier research in gene transfer to the retina using adeno-associated viruses was one of the first. This work was conducted under the Howard Hughes Medical Student Fellowship. Grant developed the first sustained treatment for ischaemic and non-ischaemic central retinal vein occlusion. His procedure, called revascularization by anastomotic decompression (RAD), allowed for communication between the blocked superficial retinal venous circulation and the open underlying choroidal circulation. In a press release issued by ISTA Pharmaceuticals, which has a strong interest in the success of the drug, it was claimed that Grant demonstrated a significant decrease in the number of treatments of ranibizumab (Lucentis) needed for the treatment of choroidal neovascularization secondary to age-related macular degeneration by the concomitant administration of bromfenac (Xibrom). There was a significant reduction in the number of injections of ranibizumab given to those patients also receiving bromfenac during a six-month period.https://www.forbes.com/prnewswire/feeds/prnewswire/2008/04/27/prnewswire200804271100PR_NEWS_USPR _____NYSU001.html ISTA Pharmaceuticals at first claimed that there was no statistically significant visual acuity improvement amongst those receiving bromfenac in addition to ranibizumab, however; they now claim that upon \\"rigorous review\\" a significant improvement can be detected. ISTA Pharmaceuticals states that these results will need to be verified in clinical studies and that bromfenac is not currently approved for the treatment of age- related macular degeneration. Grant has also become the first to introduce robotic radiosurgery in the treatment of choroidal melanoma.

It provides professional and policy advice, and technical assistance to local, national and international institutions apart from its primary mandate to provide formal education in public administration and governance education. The college also serves as headquarters-secretariat of the Eastern Regional Organization for Public Administration (EROPA) and the Association of Schools of Public Administration in the Philippines (ASPAP). History UP-NCPAG traces its roots to the Institute of Public Administration (IPA), which was established on June 15, 1952 after the University of the Philippines entered into an agreement with the University of Michigan in the United States to aid the former in providing technical assistance in the field of public administration as part of the Bell Mission's recommendations. For its first four (initially two) years, the IPA was under American leadership. The IPA was the first of its kind not only in the Philippines, but also in Asia.http://www.up-ncpag.org/ncpag/history.php In its first two years of operations, the IPA had conducted three kinds of courses with the participation of 2,500 government officials and employees. Later, undergraduate and master's degrees in Public Administration were offered. From 68 students in First Semester 1953‚Äì1954, enrollment in these academic programs increased to about 200 every semester by 1955. In 1968, the Doctor of Public Administration program was instituted. The undergraduate program was also phased out that year, only to be restored in 1987. The following year, a diploma program was opened, enabling administrators to pursue specialized courses in public administration without going through the master's degree. The College changed its name four times. From the IPA, it became the Graduate School of Public Administration, the School of Public Administration, and the College of Public Administration. The current name, the National College of Public Administration and Governance, was approved by the University of the Philippines Board of Regents in its 1126th meeting on 26 November 1998. In 2004, the Commission on Higher Education of the Philippines officially recognized UP-NCPAG as the most outstanding school of public administration in the country. Two academic units of the University, the School of Urban and Regional Planning and the Center for Integrative and Development Studies, trace their roots to UP-NCPAG. Degree programs * Bachelor of Public Administration *Diploma in Public Management * Master of Public Administration (Thesis and Non-Thesis Tracks) ** Majors: *** Public Policy and Program Administration *** Local and Regional Governance *** Spatial Information Management *** Organizational Management *** Fiscal Administration *** Public Enterprise Management *** Voluntary Sector Management * Doctor of Public Administration Centers and offices =Center for Public Administration and Governance Education= The Center for Public Administration and Governance Education (CPAGE) is in-charge of the academic programs offered by the college: the Bachelor of Public Administration (BPA), the Master of Public Administration (MPA) and the Doctor of Public Administration (DPA) programs. Its director also serves as the College Secretary and Director of Studies. =Center for Policy and Executive Development= The Center for Policy and Executive Development (CPED) is a policy think tank, research and consulting arm of NCPAG. CPED has been extensively involved in capacity development initiatives and institution building programs in the country as well as among developing countries in the region. The Center provides public institutions, non-government organizations, public corporations, and other local institutions and international organizations with the necessary professional expertise in dealing with issues of public policy, executive and administrative development, and governance. CPED has designed and implemented training courses as well as developed instructional materials for national and local governments, non-government organizations and international government agencies. =Center for Local and Regional Governance= The Center for Local and Regional Governance (CLRG) has been at the forefront of research, consulting services and facilitated learning on local governance and devolution in the country since 1965. Emerging from the Local Government Center (LGC) created through Republic Act 4223, CLRG has expanded its scope to include regional governance, urban and metropolitan management and federalism. It collaborates with local and international institutions in promoting decentralization and in publishing materials for the benefit of PA students, teachers and researchers as well as local government practitioners and other stakeholders. Today, at least 3,000 local government officials graduate from CLRG programs each electoral term while national government agencies, international donor organizations, CSOs, corporations, and individual local governments continue to engage the services of the center.http://localgov.up.edu.ph/who-we-are.html =Center for Leadership, Citizenship, and Democracy= The Center for Leadership, Citizenship and Democracy (CLCD) undertakes research, training, and consultancy on the issues, problems, and processes of leadership and citizenship. Its efforts are guided by the vision of a society striving to be peaceful, democratic, just, and humane. It grants leadership and research fellowships, organizes public lectures, and publishes books resulting from the lectures and other studies. =NCPAG Library= The NCPAG Library provides bibliographic and information support to the curricular, research and extension programs of the college. It serves primarily the needs of its students, faculty and research staff. Its book collection consists of over 38,000 volumes in the field of public administration and related subject fields. Its periodical collection consists of over 300 titles and maintains linkages with over fifty local and foreign exchange partner institutions. A special collection of Philippine government publications consisting of over 20,000 pieces of administrative and statistical reports, research studies, periodicals, handbooks and manuals, and general descriptive information on the functions and activities of the different agencies of the Philippine government is likewise maintained. The Library also serves as a supplementary source of materials in the social sciences to students, faculty and researchers of other UP units. It also accommodates government and private researchers, as well as graduate students from other schools, under certain conditions. =Publications Office= Manages the publication of the Philippine Journal of Public Administration (PJPA), one of the longest running academic journals in the country. The Office also publishes books, occasional papers, monographs, and other teaching and training materials.

(2001). Intelligent tutoring systems with conversational dialogue. AI Magazine, 22, 39‚Äì51. AutoTutor differs from other popular intelligent tutoring systems such as the Cognitive Tutor, in that it focuses on natural language dialog. This means that the tutoring occurs in the form of an ongoing conversation, with human input presented using either voice or free text input. To handle this input, AutoTutor uses computational linguistics algorithms including latent semantic analysis, regular expression matching, and speech act classifiers. These complementary techniques focus on the general meaning of the input, precise phrasing or keywords, and functional purpose of the expression, respectively. In addition to natural language input, AutoTutor can also accept ad-hoc events such as mouse clicks, learner emotions inferred from emotion sensors, and estimates of prior knowledge from a student model. Based on these inputs, the computer tutor (or tutors) determine when to reply and what speech acts to reply with. This process is driven by a \\"script\\" that includes a set of dialog-specific production rules. AutoTutor simulates the discourse patterns of human tutors, based on analysis of human-to-human tutoring sessions and theoretically-grounded tutoring strategies based on cognitive learning principles.Graesser, A.C., Wiemer- Hastings, K., Wiemer-Hastings, P., Kreuz, R., & the Tutoring Research Group (1999). Auto Tutor: A simulation of a human tutor. Journal of Cognitive Systems Research, 1, 35‚Äì51. It presents a series of challenging open-ended questions that require verbal explanations and reasoning in an answer. It engages in a collaborative, mixed initiative dialog while constructing the answer, a process that typically takes approximately 100 conversational turns. AutoTutor speaks the content of its turns through an animated conversational agent with a speech engine, some facial expressions, and rudimentary gestures. For some topics, there are graphical displays, animations of causal mechanisms, or interactive simulation environments. AutoTutor tracks the cognitive states of the learner by analyzing the content of the dialogue history. AutoTutor dynamically selects the words and statements in each conversational turn in a fashion that is sensitive to what the learner knows. Recent versions of the AutoTutor system also adapt to the learner's emotional states in addition to their cognitive states.D'Mello, S. K., Craig, S.

When are tutorial dialogues more effective than reading? Cognitive Science, 31, 3-62 Tests of AutoTutor have produced effect sizes with a mean of 0.8 (range of 0.4 to 1.5), depending on the learning measure, the comparison condition, the subject matter, and version of AutoTutor. For comparison, an effect size of 1.0 would be roughly equivalent to a full letter grade. However, the time and cost of authoring content is significantly greater than non-interactive educational materials such as slide decks or traditional textbooks, which is a common problem for intelligent tutoring systems.Aleven, V., Sewall, J., McLaren, B.

(born 1957 in Wimbledon, Surrey) is a UK- based dual national artist, who divides his time between Bristol and Pakistan. Trained originally as a sculptor in the UK, he moved to Pakistan in 1987 and engaged with the popular visual culture of South Asia and with urban crafts such as truck decoration. He teaches art in Pakistan at various institutions including until recently the Beaconhouse National University, Lahore., Biography Alesworth studied art at the Wimbledon School of Art in the tradition of late Constructivism and won the prestigious Stanley Picker Fellowship at Kingston University. He then took up a teaching assignment at the Glasgow School of Art. His encounter with Pakistani culture, especially truck art, in the early 1980s opened up his practice to a range of new materials and he moved to Karachi, Pakistan in 1987. In 2005 Alesworth moved to Lahore, Pakistan and took up a teaching position at Beaconhouse National University in the School of Visual Art (SVAD, BNU) where he taught until May 2015, then relocating to the UK. He currently maintains a studio in Bristol and works between the UK and Pakistan. He is married to the Pakistani artist Huma Mulji. In 2014 he was represented in the 8th Berlin Biennale at the Dahlem Museum Berlin curated by Juan Gaitan and at the inaugural exhibition at the new Agha Khan Museum in Toronto, in The Garden of Ideas, curated by Sharmini Pereira. He was short-listed for the Victoria and Albert Museum's fourth edition of the Jameel Prize in 2016. Art and exhibits Over the years, Alesworth has examined the conventions and visual codes of Pakistani society and of urban life in particular. His exhibits have displayed a wide range of formal influences from contemporary mass culture to the purism of late Constructivism. Many of these themes were evident in his versions of missiles and the very English teddy bear toys, displayed at the Canvas gallery (Karachi) in 2002. =Installations and Public Art= He started working with truck artists in the mid-to-late 1990s and produced several acclaimed installations, conceived in collaboration with Durriya Kazi. Through these collaborations and working with these craftsmen, he produced installations or interactive sites, such as Heart Mahal, Very Sweet Medina and Promised Lands (Arz-e-Mauood) which generated substantial interest at local and international showings and cultivated a renewed attention towards cultural politics and aesthetics of cinema hoardings, truck art, bazaar artefacts, and commercial sign paintings. =Probes= Where most of his practices were based loosely around decorative flourishes of the urban bazaars, his central themes have remained environmental degradation and nuclear proliferation influencing works like Two Bombs Kiss in 1993. His series of comical missile sculptures developed out of concern for the induction of nuclear weapons in Pakistan. The nuclear tests in April 1998 had become an iconic symbol in Pakistani streets and images of the Ghauri missile were painted atop trucks and walls all over the city. Models of the missile were displayed as sculptures across town. David referred to his latest work as a continuation of an enduring enquiry and celebration of Pakistan's urban street culture and positioned it as part celebration of the material and process and part critique of the dubious and potentially disastrous aspiration to weaponise the nation. The exhibition had a companion show with Alesworth's take on the teddy bear, where he unpacked this globalised icon in numerous ways. The teddy bears were translated into welded, riveted and soldered steel plate with polka-dots and displayed in public places similar to the missiles. The 'Teddy's Bears' reference both their origin in American political history and their connotation of the restraint of power and the toys of a war child; this in the context of the American and Western powers interventions in Afghanistan over the last decades. = Textile Interventions = Since 2005 Alesworth's work has been substantially engaged with the post-colonial, in large part due to his relocation to the historic city of Lahore which is also known as the City of Gardens. In this period he has created a number of works based upon the oriental carpet which he has termed textile interventions. Over the last decade his work has been predominately organised around ideas arising from The Garden. However this has been a very expanded ideation of the garden, more of the global forest of which we are all a part or as nature and culture than of the urban garden, but that too. He has visited the Botanical Garden as a concentration camp of exotic aliens, imprisoned in an act of cultural cleansing (Linz : 2007). The post-colonial garden in the video work \\"Joank\\" 2008, several public botanical interventions in Berlin, 2009‚Äì2010 and botanical taxonomy in The Garden of Babel 2009. Also ideas of garden perfection in the textile works Garden Palimpsest 2010 and Hyde Park, Kashan 1862 of 2011 amongst others. He takes the garden as his key metaphor with which to probe humanity's culturally specific relationships with the natural world and toward understanding nature more as a social problem.

It was founded as a co-operative in 1862, and, in 2007, joined the small number of UK co-operative retailers to demutualise. In the years immediately prior to demutualising, M&F; Co-op ran a funeral business, a food shop and department store in Musselburgh, and also invested in commercial property, including shops and a leisure complex at Fisherrow harbour. It converted into a private company limited by shares called M & F (Scotland) Limited. Demutualisation M&F; Co-op made headlines as one of a very few retail members of the British co-operative movement to demutualise. =2005 demutualisation attempt= A 2005 attempt by M&F; Co-op to demutualise was halted by a Court of Session interdict, and resulted in an investigation by the Financial Services Authority (FSA), the regulator for Industrial and Provident Societies such as M&F; Co-op. The petition for interdict, which was made by eight members opposing demutualisation, including former president George Cunningham, alleged 19 governance irregularities, including conflicts of interest and an inquorate board of directors, as three of the six directors had resigned in preceding weeks. The FSA investigation reported in 2006 that M&F; Co-op's democratic governance had not been functioning effectively. =2007 demutualization= The board called a further members meeting for June 2007 to vote on a demutualization resolution. In September 2007, the M&F; Co- op incorporated a private limited company, M & F (Scotland) Limited, and transferred its assets and obligations to it, deregistering as an Industrial and Provident Society on 1 October 2007. Co-operative News reported that M&F; Co-op had technically demutualised and was no longer eligible for membership of Co-operatives UK, due to its articles granting voting rights on the proportion of shares owned rather than the fundamental co-operative principle of one member one vote. Operations M&F; Co-op operated a food store and a non-food department store in Musselburgh High Street, a commercial property business, and funeral services in Musselburgh and Dalkeith. In January 2006, M&F; Co-op had net assets of ¬£6,745,943. It built and operated the Quayside restaurant and leisure complex overlooking Fisherrow harbour, which opened in 1992. It sold it in 2007 to leisure entrepreneur Charan Gill, who refurbished it and renamed it The Quay. The commercial property business also leased shops. Co-operative movement In 2007, it was the smallest retail consumer co-operative in Scotland, by number of shops. Along with the much larger Scotmid, Lothian Borders & Angus, and The Co-operative Group, the movement had five such co-operatives in Scotland. M&F; Co-op and Clydebank Co-operative Society were the only two that had not merged into a regional or national co- operative by that time. In 1993, M&F; Co-op's president George Cunningham, (who petitioned the Court of Session for the 2005 interdict that delayed demutualization,) was president of the Co-operative Congress, considered the highest honour in the British co-operative movement. The Co-operative Group owns and operates a pharmacy in Musselburgh High Street, and an Alldays convenience store in Clayknowes Road, that are not affiliated with M&F; Co-op.

Subdirectly irreducible algebras play a somewhat analogous role in algebra to primes in number theory. Definition A universal algebra A is said to be subdirectly irreducible when A has more than one element, and when any subdirect representation of A includes (as a factor) an algebra isomorphic to A, with the isomorphism being given by the projection map. Examples * The two-element chain, as either a Boolean algebra, a Heyting algebra, a lattice, or a semilattice, is subdirectly irreducible. In fact, the two-element chain is the only subdirectly irreducible distributive lattice. * Any finite chain with two or more elements, as a Heyting algebra, is subdirectly irreducible. (This is not the case for chains of three or more elements as either lattices or semilattices, which are subdirectly reducible to the two-element chain. The difference with Heyting algebras is that a ‚Üí b need not be comparable with a under the lattice order even when b is.) * Any finite cyclic group of order a power of a prime (i.e. any finite p-group) is subdirectly irreducible. (One weakness of the analogy between subdirect irreducibles and prime numbers is that the integers are subdirectly representable by any infinite family of nonisomorphic prime-power cyclic groups, e.g. just those of order a Mersenne prime assuming there are infinitely many.) In fact, an abelian group is subdirectly irreducible if and only if it is isomorphic to a finite p-group or isomorphic to a Pr√ºfer group (an infinite but countable p-group, which is the direct limit of its finite p-subgroups). * A vector space is subdirectly irreducible if and only if it has dimension one. Properties The subdirect representation theorem of universal algebra states that every algebra is subdirectly representable by its subdirectly irreducible quotients. An equivalent definition of \\"subdirect irreducible\\" therefore is any algebra A that is not subdirectly representable by those of its quotients not isomorphic to A. (This is not quite the same thing as \\"by its proper quotients\\" because a proper quotient of A may be isomorphic to A, for example the quotient of the semilattice (Z, min) obtained by identifying just the two elements 3 and 4.) An immediate corollary is that any variety, as a class closed under homomorphisms, subalgebras, and direct products, is determined by its subdirectly irreducible members, since every algebra A in the variety can be constructed as a subalgebra of a suitable direct product of the subdirectly irreducible quotients of A, all of which belong to the variety because A does. For this reason one often studies not the variety itself but just its subdirect irreducibles. An algebra A is subdirectly irreducible if and only if it contains two elements that are identified by every proper quotient, equivalently, if and only if its lattice Con A of congruences has a least nonidentity element. That is, any subdirect irreducible must contain a specific pair of elements witnessing its irreducibility in this way. Given such a witness (a,b) to subdirect irreducibility we say that the subdirect irreducible is (a,b)-irreducible. Given any class C of similar algebras, J√≥nsson's lemma (due to Bjarni J√≥nsson) states that if the variety HSP(C) generated by C is congruence-distributive, its subdirect irreducibles are in HSPU(C), that is, they are quotients of subalgebras of ultraproducts of members of C. (If C is a finite set of finite algebras, the ultraproduct operation is redundant.) Applications A necessary and sufficient condition for a Heyting algebra to be subdirectly irreducible is for there to be a greatest element strictly below 1. The witnessing pair is that element and 1, and identifying any other pair a, b of elements identifies both a‚Üíb and b‚Üía with 1 thereby collapsing everything above those two implications to 1. Hence every finite chain of two or more elements as a Heyting algebra is subdirectly irreducible. By J√≥nsson's Lemma, subdirectly irreducible algebras of a congruence-distributive variety generated by a finite set of finite algebras are no larger than the generating algebras, since the quotients and subalgebras of an algebra A are never larger than A itself. For example, the subdirect irreducibles in the variety generated by a finite linearly ordered Heyting algebra H must be just the nondegenerate quotients of H, namely all smaller linearly ordered nondegenerate Heyting algebras. The conditions cannot be dropped in general: for example, the variety of all Heyting algebras is generated by the set of its finite subdirectly irreducible algebras, but there exist subdirectly irreducible Heyting algebras of arbitrary (infinite) cardinality. There also exists a single finite algebra generating a (non- congruence-distributive) variety with arbitrarily large subdirect irreducibles.R. McKenzie, The residual bounds of finite algebras, Int. J. Algebra Comput. 6 (1996), 1‚Äì29.

It was a half-hour program consisting of brain-teasing animated skits (either stop-motion or cartoon) designed to make the viewers think. Episodes The series pilot was aired in 1983 (featuring a female Sphinx in the intro), with another five episodes (this time with a gentleman with an egg for a head) made in 1984-1985 with new games and a few brought back from the pilot. After that, an episode called \\"The Best of Braingames\\" was made which had five of the best Braingames games from episodes 1, 3, and 4, plus a special episode of \\"The Riddler\\" (see below) where Chuck Roast read off the winners of a contest for \\"The Absitively Posolutely Worst Riddles in America\\". Every episode in the series ends with a sad and crying voice saying, \\"Braingames...is now...over.\\" On the \\"Best of\\" episode, an equally sad voice says, \\"The Best of Braingames...is now...over.\\" Although full episodes have not been shown in years, HBO has occasionally shown single games between programs in the late 1980s-mid-1990s. In 1996-2000, full episodes were later shown occasionally each month on HBO Family. Games The following is a list of the different games played on the various shows: * Earplay - From both the original episode and played on two of the later episodes, this consisted of 5 different sounds being made. First the viewer simply heard the sound for about 15 seconds, then the sound would be rewound and replayed, this time with the corresponding video footage. (NOTE: In all three showings, at least one of the sounds was an arcade game.) * Digitville - Here, we visit a town where the entire population consists of people and pets whose heads are actually items that use numbers (clocks, dice, thermometers, rulers, etc.) (although one dog had a ruler for a body), and they come up with number games for us to play. This was played on two of the newer episodes. Produced by Jerry Lieberman. * Faces/Whosamawhatchamacallits - Faces was on the first episode, then Whosamawhatchamacallits was the game on the next 4 episodes. The two games were similar, showing initially a distorted image, while the voice gives clues until the image is clear. Each one started with a superhero and ended with a monster, aside from the \\"Faces\\" prototype, which ended with Dracula but began with the Mona Lisa, as well as the last of the \\"Whosamawhatchamacallits\\", which was bookended by two superheroes; Spider-Man and The Incredible Hulk. In the \\"Faces\\" prototype, one distorted image has an illustrated cameo of two Fraggles (Red and Mokey). * Tales of Wrongovia - Essentially an anachronism quiz, this segment goes back into history, where a historical person is faced with a dilemma. Each dilemma involves showing four different items that would all be useful for the person in question, but in all but two, one of the items wasn't available to them at the time. (In the other two, only one of the four items was available.) It's the job of the viewer to guess which one couldn't (or, in the case of the other two, could) be used. Produced by Michael Sporn. * The Riddler - Chuck Roast hosts a game full of riddles. Produced by Joey Ahlbum. * Memory Rock/Workout - Four people are shown either in a rock band or exercising, and questions are asked that involve how many of them are of a specific way (either what they are wearing or what they are doing). Both of them asked a question where the answer was \\"none\\". In \\"Rock\\", the final question had nothing to do with numbers but was what the name of the song they were singing (\\"My Boyfriend\\"), and in \\"Workout\\", the final question had nothing to do with the people exercising, but with the piano player. (How many rings was he wearing on his hands.). * Odd Card Out/Safari Solitaire - The original episode had Odd Card Out, and the subsequent episodes had Safari Solitaire. The idea was that four cards were dealt with different pictures, but one was set apart from the rest based on the question asked. Odd Card Out was based on numerous things, but Safari Solitaire was specifically geared towards animals (and occasionally humans). Produced by Stan Smith. * Uninvited Guests - Groups of four people who look like they belong together come into a very upscale party, but one doesn't belong. It is later revealed which one is uninvited. * Eyewitness - A man goes in and quietly robs a bank. Then 6 hours later, four suspects are caught and the viewers must guess which one was the robber while remembering that only certain things can naturally be changed on a person in a 6-hour time span and that nothing on the suspects is fake (no putty, makeup, wigs, or fake facial hair). Produced by Michael Sporn. * Museum Mis ~~s~~ takes - This segment is set in a museum and every picture shown includes something out of the ordinary. One picture (Jan Steen's ‚ÄúThe Feast of Saint Nicholas‚Äù) featured an animated cameo of the Cookie Monster from Sesame Street. * Eyeball Twisters - Things are shown so close-up so as to not be able to tell what they are immediately. Meanwhile, a voice-over gives clues until the object is revealed. * Read Between the Lines - Essentially a rebus puzzle, in which the voice over tells a story, then pauses as a word puzzle is displayed, and the viewer has to guess what it means. For example, \\"I right I\\" would mean \\"right between the eyes\\". * Lloofbat/Aceps Gevoya/Splatnarnt/Mane Tath Storp - Four different games which involved unscrambling words associated with the theme, which was also scrambled. Lloofbat (football) was all things regarding a typical football game as it is played. Aceps Gevoya (space voyage) involved things an alien named BLT runs into as he makes his way home after spending quite an amount of time exploring space. This segment was produced by Janet Perlman. Splatnarnt (transplant), which was produced by Fred Garbers, involved a mad scientist and his female assistant creating a monster, as the viewers unscramble inner parts of the body. Mane Tath Storp (name that sport), which was produced by Bill Davis, appeared in game-show format, in which different contestants have a sport described to them. Both they, and the viewer, have to unscramble its name. After each segment, the voice-over summed up the previous action with the key words back in their scrambled states. Additionally, in the episodes in which they appeared, they were the final game of the show. Splatnarnt was directed by Fred Garbers, and Mane Tath Storp was directed by Bill Davis. * Unidentified Flying Pranksters - A group of wild aliens come to a typical town and changes one minor detail from what was originally seen. The viewers must guess what they did. Produced by John Canemaker. * Ze Inspector and Ze Lost Princess - This segment involved an inspector reading a letter to find a princess; the letter was actually a rebus puzzle. Produced by Bill Davis. * Aliens - A viewer must find one of the four aliens that doesn't belong. * Mysteriosos - A game involving droodles that the viewer must guess, similar in appearance to \\"The Riddler\\". Produced by Joey Ahlbum. Home release The series was released over three VHS videotapes in the 1980s and 1990s, but there has been no word on a DVD release yet.

The church burned down in 2005, and was not rebuilt. Architecture The Gothic Revival structure was constructed of random fieldstone ashlars, capped with sandstone; the roof was slate over an open timber arched frame. A separate chancel was placed on the south end of the building, and a shed-roofed ambulatory was run along the west side to house a side chapel and its altar. An odd detail was a set of dormers in the main west side roof, each with a lancet window; other windows also generally were of the lancet form, including a triple set at either end of the building. A belltower was attached to the northwest corner of the building; its third story, which contained the bell chamber, was topped with a Rhenish helm roof and was made octagonal through the truncation of the four corners. History The Trinity Episcopal Church was established in 1845. The architect of the church was Samuel J. Ladd, a founding member of the congregation.Page 52, Statewide Historical Preservation Report P-PA-1: Pawtucket, Rhode Island (RIHPC, 1978)Page 8, Journal of the Proceedings of the 56th Annual Convention of the Diocese of Massachusetts (1846) He drafted the plan between 1850 and 1851. In 1865, architect Clifton A. Hall was hired to design an addition, which consisted of the low ambulatory on the west side of the building. At the same time, the Providence firm of Cattanach & Cliff was hired to redecorate the interior. In 1901, a parish house was built. It was designed by noted practitioners Stone, Carpenter & Willson. This small building extended from the rear of the church to School Street.Page xii, The American Architect & Building News (November 24, 1900) Frances E. Henley executed some alterations in 1937.http://www.rihs.org/mssinv/Mss486.htm Trinity also owned a house it used as a rectory. It was located at 50 Main Street, at the corner of School. It had been built in 1815 as the residence of Eliphalet Slack. It was a 3-story house in the Federal style.Page 249, Rhode Island: A Guide to the Smallest State (Federal Writers' Project, 1937) The house was destroyed many years before the church itself. The church complex was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1972. It was destroyed by fire in 2005 and not rebuilt.

File versioning and history is available, however there is a cap to 30 days or an additional cost per month. =Backblaze B2 Storage= In September 2015, Backblaze launched a new product, B2 Cloud Storage. Being an Infrastructure as a service (IaaS), it is targeted at software integration for different kinds of businesses. It directly competes with similar services, such as Amazon S3, Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud. In April 2018, Backblaze announced cloud computing partnerships that directly connect Backblaze's data centers with its partners, Packet and ServerCentral. Technology =Data centers= Backblaze has four data centers; three are in the United States and one is in Europe. Two U.S. data centers are in Northern California near Sacramento, and one is in Phoenix, Arizona. Backblaze's data center in the European Union is located in Amsterdam, Netherlands. =Redundancy= In order to increase redundancy, data uploaded onto Backblaze's data center is sharded into 17 data pieces and three parity shards for each file. Parity shard bits are computed by the Reed‚ÄìSolomon error correction algorithm. The shards are stored in 20 different drives, each in a separate cabinet to increase resilience to a power loss to an entire cabinet, or other physically-based issue. Backblaze states that its 'Vault' architecture is designed with 99.999999999% annual durability. =Encryption= For Computer Backup, Backblaze uses a combination of AES and SSL encryption to protect user data. Data is stored in Backblaze storage using Reed-Solomon erasure coding and encrypted with the user's private key, which is secured with the user's password and username. The default encryption of private keys is done server side, which is unlikely to protect against government subpoena or serious data breach. Users desiring additional security and privacy can use the optional private encryption key (PEK), but the PEK passphrase is sent to the server when it is initially set, and must be sent again to restore any data. Encryption for their B2 storage is handled entirely by the user and client software to manage the stored data, making it immune to government subpoena or data breach and protecting the data during transfer and ultimate storage in Backblaze's data centers. =Storage Pod open design= A server case using the open design of the Storage Pod. In 2009 and 2011, the company released CAD drawings of the computer case used by the storage servers in its datacenters. With commercial off-the-shelf components such as x64 processors, disks, and motherboards, high-density storage servers can be built at a lower cost than commercial ones. The company has since made six iterations of the design over the years.

Autograph drawing by Palladio (London, RIBA XVII/2r). Villa Valmarana (also known as Valmarana Bressan) is a patrician villa at Vigardolo, Monticello Conte Otto, in the province of Vicenza, in northern Italy. The building is attributed to Andrea Palladio on the basis of an extant drawing of the villa that is undoubtedly by the architect. The villa was constructed during the 1540s, and is one of Palladio's earlier works. It was commissioned by two cousins of the Valmarana family. The layout of the rooms suggests that Palladio's mandate was to provide accommodation for two nuclear families. The design also shows the influence of buildings from antiquity, which Palladio had seen on his first visit to Rome in 1541. The villa is decorated with frescoes, some of which date from the 16th century; they are more or less contemporaneous with the original occupation of the building.

It was filmed mainly with puppets, but occasionally used computer graphics. The series was focused on the characters Rabbit, Wolf, and their children. Music for the show was done by Jim Guttridge, with the theme done by Dan Gagnon, Sandy Nuttgens, and Michael Scott. Only four episodes were released on VHS and DVD in the 2001 volume A Rabbit for All Seasons.  Plot outline  Rabbit lives in a forest in England with his children: Lucy, Peter, and Emily. Wolf, who has been driven out of Canada by the Brotherhood of Wolves, moves in next door with his sons Barry and Simon. Although Wolf has a strong desire to eat Rabbit, his children develop close friendships with Lucy, rejecting traditional dietary preferences.  List of characters  Where the children have normal names, the adult characters are named after the animals they are. *Rabbit (Voiced by Robert Lindsay) - Rabbit is confident, clever and quick-witted. A lot of the series' humour is based around the conflict between him, Wolf and Fox. He is also the father of Lucy, Peter, and Emily. Rabbit is tall and wears blue trousers, red converse shoes, a white shirt and a flowery jacket. It is mentioned in the series that Rabbit's wife was eaten by a wolf. *Lucy (Voiced by Doon Mackichan) - Rabbit's oldest child, Lucy is calm, and often come across as smarter than her father. She is good friends with Barry and Simon, despite the conflict between their fathers. *Peter and Emily - Rabbit's youngest children are twin babies. Due to their age, they do not speak in any episodes. *Wolf (Voiced by Michael McShane) - Exiled from his native Canada by the Brotherhood of Wolves, Wolf has relocated to a forest in England where he lives next door to Rabbit. He is dim-witted and clumsy (though has occasional moments of brilliance) and often teams up with Fox in his attempts to catch Rabbit. Wolf is also the father of Barry and Simon. Wolf can prove to be dangerously angry and scary at times when it comes to planning on both hunting and killing his prey. He is tall and wears a red shirt, black leather pants a jacket and platform-like shoes which resemble women's boots. It is mentioned in the series that Wolf's wife left him for another wolf. *Simon (Voiced by Patrick McKenna) - Wolf's oldest son, Simon is smarter than his brother Barry, though is not all that bright himself. *Barry (Voiced by Se√°n Cullen) - Wolf's youngest son. Barry is good-hearted but rather dim-witted. He has a small crush on Lucy. *Fox (Voiced by Simon Callow) - Wolf's posh friend sometimes talks to his mother, who appears to be a voice inside his head. Like Wolf, Fox too is an enemy of Rabbit and regularly tries to eat him. Fox can be very clever when it comes to devising schemes to catch Rabbit, though Rabbit usually manages to foil his plans. He wears a white shirt, yellow waist coat jacket and dark pants. *Terrapin (Voice by Tim McInnerny) - Rabbit's best friend. Terrapin is very cowardly, although there have been occasions when he has shown courage. His twin brother, Colin, looks exactly like him, save for his moustache. Terrapin wears an underdiver's water suit and flippers. *Bear (Voiced by Simon Callow) - Lucy's confidant and advisor, he is often seen painting. Barry and Simon are frightened of him, though he has a kindly personality. Rabbit and Terrapin are also scared of him. *Sheep - The Sheep in the show are Wolf's lunch & dinner that he always tries to catch one by one if they are in his way.

At present it is a small town in the Khamgaon Tehsil of Buldhana District. After this initial victory at Ahmednagar Prince Murad, son of Akbar settled in Berar Subah with Balapur as his headquarters. Near Balapur he founded a new city named Shahapur and constructed a beautiful palace near the banks of Mun River for himself during 1597. The shahpur forts / palace was built by Mirza azam shaha the son of Aurangzeb. History The account of Berar in the Ain-i- Akbari was added- to that work in 1596-97. The greater part of the Akola District was included in Akbar's sarkar or revenue district of Narnala, but some of the parganas of this sarkar are now included in Buldana, while Akola, on the other hand, includes three parganas of Akbar's revenue district of Basim. The whole revenue demand for the area now included in the Akola District seems to have been nearly twenty-four lakhs of rupees. The only special notice of any places in the District has reference to Balapur, Shahpur, and Basim. ' Near Balapur,' says Abul Fazl, ' are two streams, about the borders of which are found various kinds of pretty stones, which are cut and kept as curiosities. Six kos distant were the headquarters of Sultan Murad, which grew into a fine city under the name of Shahpur. Of Basim he writes,' About Basim is an indigenous race, for the most part proud and refractory, called Hatgars: their forces consist of 1000, cavalry and 5000 infantry.' He adds that the Hatgars are Rajputs, which is a mistake, for they are a branch of the Dhangar caste. It is strange that according to the figures of the census of 1901 Hatgars were exceptionally weak in numbers in the late Basim District. 36\\\\. After the fall of Ahmadnagar Balapur was still the principal garrison town of Berar, but Daniyal preferred Burhanpur, where he died of drink in 1605, as his viceregal capital. The death of his favourite son was a severe shock to Akbar, who survived Daniyal only for a few months, and died in October 1605, when he was succeeded by his eldest son Salim, who took the title of Jahangir.

In statistics, an L-estimator is an estimator which is an L-statistic ‚Äì a linear combination of order statistics of the measurements. This can be as little as a single point, as in the median (of an odd number of values), or as many as all points, as in the mean. The main benefits of L-estimators are that they are often extremely simple, and often robust statistics: assuming sorted data, they are very easy to calculate and interpret, and are often resistant to outliers. They thus are useful in robust statistics, as descriptive statistics, in statistics education, and when computation is difficult. However, they are inefficient, and in modern times robust statistics M-estimators are preferred, though these are much more difficult computationally. In many circumstances L-estimators are reasonably efficient, and thus adequate for initial estimation.  Examples  A basic example is the median. Given n values x_1, \\\\ldots, x_n, if n=2k+1 is odd, the median equals x_{(k+1)}, the (n+1)/2-th order statistic; if n=2k is even, it is the average of two order statistics: (x_{(k)} + x_{(k+1)})/2. These are both linear combinations of order statistics, and the median is therefore a simple example of an L-estimator. A more detailed list of examples includes: with a single point, the maximum, the minimum, or any single order statistic or quantile; with one or two points, the median; with two points, the mid-range, the range, the midsummary (trimmed mid-range, including the midhinge), and the trimmed range (including the interquartile range and interdecile range); with three points, the trimean; with a fixed fraction of the points, the trimmed mean (including interquartile mean) and the Winsorized mean; with all points, the mean. Note that some of these (such as median, or mid-range) are measures of central tendency, and are used as estimators for a location parameter, such as the mean of a normal distribution, while others (such as range or trimmed range) are measures of statistical dispersion, and are used as estimators of a scale parameter, such as the standard deviation of a normal distribution. L-estimators can also measure the shape of a distribution, beyond location and scale. For example, the midhinge minus the median is a 3-term L-estimator that measures the skewness, and other differences of midsummaries give measures of asymmetry at different points in the tail. Sample L-moments are L-estimators for the population L-moment, and have rather complex expressions. L-moments are generally treated separately; see that article for details.  Robustness  L-estimators are often statistically resistant, having a high breakdown point. This is defined as the fraction of the measurements which can be arbitrarily changed without causing the resulting estimate to tend to infinity (i.e., to \\"break down\\"). The breakdown point of an L-estimator is given by the closest order statistic to the minimum or maximum: for instance, the median has a breakdown point of 50% (the highest possible), and a n% trimmed or Winsorized mean has a breakdown point of n%. Not all L-estimators are robust; if it includes the minimum or maximum, then it has a breakdown point of 0. These non-robust L-estimators include the minimum, maximum, mean, and mid- range. The trimmed equivalents are robust, however. Robust L-estimators used to measure dispersion, such as the IQR, provide robust measures of scale. Applications In practical use in robust statistics, L-estimators have been replaced by M-estimators, which provide robust statistics that also have high relative efficiency, at the cost of being much more computationally complex and opaque. However, the simplicity of L-estimators means that they are easily interpreted and visualized, and makes them suited for descriptive statistics and statistics education; many can even be computed mentally from a five- number summary or seven-number summary, or visualized from a box plot. L-estimators play a fundamental role in many approaches to non-parametric statistics. Though non-parametric, L-estimators are frequently used for parameter estimation, as indicated by the name, though they must often be adjusted to yield an unbiased consistent estimator. The choice of L-estimator and adjustment depend on the distribution whose parameter is being estimated. For example, when estimating a location parameter, for a symmetric distribution a symmetric L-estimator (such as the median or midhinge) will be unbiased. However, if the distribution has skew, symmetric L-estimators will generally be biased and require adjustment. For example, in a skewed distribution, the nonparametric skew (and Pearson's skewness coefficients) measure the bias of the median as an estimator of the mean. When estimating a scale parameter, such as when using an L-estimator as a robust measures of scale, such as to estimate the population variance or population standard deviation, one generally must multiply by a scale factor to make it an unbiased consistent estimator; see scale parameter: estimation. For example, dividing the IQR by 2\\\\sqrt{2} \\\\operatorname{erf}^{-1}(1/2) \\\\approx 1.349 (using the error function) makes it an unbiased, consistent estimator for the population variance if the data follow a normal distribution. L-estimators can also be used as statistics in their own right ‚Äì for example, the median is a measure of location, and the IQR is a measure of dispersion. In these cases, the sample statistics can act as estimators of their own expected value; for example, the sample median is an estimator of the population median. Advantages Beyond simplicity, L-estimators are also frequently easy to calculate and robust. Assuming sorted data, L-estimators involving only a few points can be calculated with far fewer mathematical operations than efficient estimates. Before the advent of electronic calculators and computers, these provided a useful way to extract much of the information from a sample with minimal labour. These remained in practical use through the early and mid 20th century, when automated sorting of punch card data was possible, but computation remained difficult, and is still of use today, for estimates given a list of numerical values in non-machine-readable form, where data input is more costly than manual sorting. They also allow rapid estimation. L-estimators are often much more robust than maximally efficient conventional methods ‚Äì the median is maximally statistically resistant, having a 50% breakdown point, and the X% trimmed mid-range has an X% breakdown point, while the sample mean (which is maximally efficient) is minimally robust, breaking down for a single outlier. Efficiency While L-estimators are not as efficient as other statistics, they often have reasonably high relative efficiency, and show that a large fraction of the information used in estimation can be obtained using only a few points ‚Äì as few as one, two, or three. Alternatively, they show that order statistics contain a significant amount of information. For example, in terms of efficiency, given a sample of a normally-distributed numerical parameter, the arithmetic mean (average) for the population can be estimated with maximum efficiency by computing the sample mean ‚Äì adding all the members of the sample and dividing by the number of members. However, for a large data set (over 100 points) from a symmetric population, the mean can be estimated reasonably efficiently relative to the best estimate by L-estimators. Using a single point, this is done by taking the median of the sample, with no calculations required (other than sorting); this yields an efficiency of 64% or better (for all n). Using two points, a simple estimate is the midhinge (the 25% trimmed mid-range), but a more efficient estimate is the 29% trimmed mid-range, that is, averaging the two values 29% of the way in from the smallest and the largest values: the 29th and 71st percentiles; this has an efficiency of about 81%. For three points, the trimean (average of median and midhinge) can be used, though the average of the 20th, 50th, and 80th percentile yields 88% efficiency. Using further points yield higher efficiency, though it is notable that only 3 points are needed for very high efficiency. For estimating the standard deviation of a normal distribution, the scaled interdecile range gives a reasonably efficient estimator, though instead taking the 7% trimmed range (the difference between the 7th and 93rd percentiles) and dividing by 3 (corresponding to 86% of the data of a normal distribution falling within 1.5 standard deviations of the mean) yields an estimate of about 65% efficiency. For small samples, L-estimators are also relatively efficient: the midsummary of the 3rd point from each end has an efficiency around 84% for samples of size about 10, and the range divided by \\\\sqrt{n} has reasonably good efficiency for sizes up to 20, though this drops with increasing n and the scale factor can be improved (efficiency 85% for 10 points). Other heuristic estimators for small samples include the range over n (for standard error), and the range squared over the median (for the chi-squared of a Poisson distribution).

It copies data from one file or block device (hard disk, CD-ROM, etc.) to another, trying hard to rescue data in case of read errors. GNU ddrescue is a program written in C++ that was initially released in 2004 and has since become available in most Linux distributions. Description GNU ddrescue is not a derivative of \`dd\`, nor is it related to \`dd\` in any way except in that both can be used for copying data from one device to another. The difference is that ddrescue uses a sophisticated algorithm to copy data from failing drives causing them as little additional damage as possible. GNU ddrescue is considered to have the most sophisticated implementation of a block-size-changing algorithm in free and open source software, and is considered an essential data recovery tool. If one uses the \\"\`mapfile\`\\" (previously called \\"logfile\\") feature of ddrescue, the data is rescued very efficiently (only the needed blocks are read). One can also interrupt the rescue at any time and resume it later at the same point. ddrescue does not write zeros to the output when it finds bad sectors in the input, and does not truncate the output file if not asked to. As such, every time one runs ddrescue on the same output file, it tries to fill in the gaps without wiping out the data already rescued. Other uses Automatic merging of backups: If one has two or more damaged copies of a file, CD-ROM, etc., and run ddrescue on all of them, one at a time, with the same output file, one will probably obtain a complete and error-free file. Using the mapfile, only the needed blocks are read from the second and successive copies. ddrescue recommends lzip for compression of backups because the lzip format is designed for long-term data archiving and provides data recovery capabilities which nicely complement those of ddrescue. (ddrescue fills unreadable sectors with data from other copies, while lziprecover corrects corrupt sectors with data from other copies). If the cause of file corruption is damaged media, the combination ddrescue + lziprecover is the best option for recovering data from multiple damaged copies. ddrescue also features a \\"fill mode\\" able to selectively overwrite parts of the output file, which has a number of interesting uses like wiping data, marking bad areas or even, in some cases, \\"repair\\" damaged sectors.

There were two build contracts. The first was in 1988 and the second build quantity occurred in 1998. The Perentie was based on the Land Rover Defender 110, and was introduced in 1987 to replace the ageing fleet of Series 2A and 3 Land Rovers. The Land Rover Perenties were produced in 4 x 4 and 6 x 6 variants and powered by an Isuzu 3.9-litre four- cylinder 4BD1 diesel engine or 4BD1-T turbo (see List of Isuzu engines). They have proven themselves both in Australia and on operations overseas, including in Somalia, Timor Leste, the Solomon Islands, Iraq and Afghanistan. Design The major differences between the Land Rover Perentie and British Land Rovers are the relocation of the spare wheel to a position under the rear of the load area, a galvanised chassis and the Isuzu engine. The original army contract called for a variety of unusual features including being able to sustain being hung from a helicopter by one corner without causing the chassis to distort. The 6 x 6 version has a wider cab and load sharing leaf-sprung rear axles. The 6 x 6 also has a turbocharger. The original order was for 2,500 4 x 4 and 400 6 x 6 vehicles between 1987 and 1990, while further vehicles were later added under Project Bushranger. History The name Perentie originates from Land Rover's successful tender to Project Perentie, which was the official Australian Army trial to select new 1 and 2-tonne light vehicles. During the Project Perentie trials the Land Rover/Isuzu 110 and 6 x 6 variants were compared against the Jeep AM10, the Mercedes-Benz 300GD and the Unimog, while the Toyota Land Cruiser was evaluated two years later. The origins of the name comes from the Perentie (Varanus giganteus) lizard species, which is the largest goanna lizard native to Australia. As of February 2013 the Perenties are being disposed of, with the remaining in-service units being replaced by Mercedes-Benz G-Wagons under Project Land 121. The Defender has proven to be vulnerable to land mines and improvised explosive devices, and the army's new specification calls for optional armour. The Army Perenties are being replaced with unarmoured Mercedes G-Wagens. \\"Land Rover vehicles built for the ADF under the Perentie (1984‚Äì92) and Bushranger contracts (1992‚Äì98) were specially designed 4x4 and 6x6 vehicles built at either Moorebank (Perentie) or Adelaide (Bushranger) and had different power units and transmission systems to the Solihull-built, Defender-based Land Rover 110 vehicles now commissioned. George Fowler, LRA engineering, who is responsible for the development of this latest production-based Land Rover 110, said the order for the new TD5 Defender was a breakthrough for LRA in the ADF vehicle procurement program.\\" \\"The ADF has decided to use a production vehicle which is designed for a ten- year period of service. This decision recognises the increased levels of reliability and durability of a Solihull-production Defender 110, with the new Td5 power unit.\\" \\"George Fowler and his team of engineers developed a concept vehicle, based on a production Land Rover 110, that was similar to existing Perentie and Bushranger Land Rover 4x4 vehicles in terms of driver control layout and ancillary equipment.\\"article in Experience, Number 23, 2000, publ.

Though probably quite older than this, even primitive, the festival is celebrated with the name \\"Pamboeotia\\" only starting in the 3rd century BC. The festival was celebrated in the tenth month of the Boeotian calendar, Pamboiotos, at a temple of Athena Itonia in the neighborhood of Coronea. The principal object of the meeting was the common worship of Athena Itonia.Strabo, Geographica ix. p. 411Pausanias, Description of Greece ix. 34. ¬ß 1 Activities included dancing and music and athletic events of a somewhat militaristic character, such as spear-throwing, trumpeting, heralding, mock battles, and horse racing. The priestess of the shrine was appointed by the Boeotian League. A depiction of a Pamboeotia festival can be seen on a lekane in the British Museum, on which men approach an altar of Athena that is covered in flame. Some of the men are leading an ox to sacrifice to the goddess. Before these men is a woman bearing on her head a platter of offerings. From Polybius it appears that during this national festival no war was allowed to be carried on, and that in case of a war a truce was always concluded.Polybius, iv. 3, ix. 34 This panegyris is also mentioned by Plutarch.Plutarch, Amat. Narrat. p. 774, f. It is a disputed point whether the Pamboeotia had anything to do with the political constitution of Boeotia, or with the relation of its several towns to Thebes; but if so, it can have been only previous to the time when Thebes had obtained the undisputed supremacy in Boeotia.The question is discussed in Sainte Croix, Des Gouvernements federat. p. 211, &c.;Desir√©-Raoul Rochette, Sur la Forme et l'Administr. de l'Etat federatif des Beotiens, in the Mem. de l'Acad. des Inscript. vol. viii.

Krehbiel was a member of the faculty at the Art Institute of Chicago for 39 years and at the Armour Institute of Technology (later Illinois Institute of Technology after merging with the Lewis Institute) for 32 years. In 1926, he helped pioneer the Chicago Art Institute Summer School of Painting (later named Ox-Bow) in Saugatuck, Michigan, where he spent most of his remaining summers teaching and painting.

Retrieved November 4, 2009 When able to break away from his students, he would capture the surrounding rolling hills and the Kalamazoo River in oil, watercolor, and pastel. He would often visit Saugatuck in winters to portray the area in its vast and billowing cover of snow. =Painting outdoors= Loading a Grain Freighter Michigan Ave. Bridge During the years of 1912 through about 1930, Krehbiel was known to leave his Park Ridge, Illinois, home on a freezing cold morning and not return until the end of the day with two or three freshly painted canvases of the surrounding landscape.Albert Krehbiel: An American Impressionist , by Kim Coventry; Sonnenschien Gallery, Lake Forest College, Lake Forest, Illinois; 1989; 11 pp., ill.Albert Henry Krehbiel (1873-1945), American Impressionist and Muralist: Biography Retrieved November 6, 2009 He also composed many watercolors and countless pastels of the area, often capturing the local inhabitants in the warmer months working in the fields or taking a moment to enjoy the lush forest landscape populated with brooks and streams. Occasionally, Krehbiel would visit the northern Illinois town of Galena on weekends and holidays to paint large canvases of the tree-covered hills with their scattering of homes and barns. When teaching at the Art Institute of Chicago and residing (at the Cliff Dwellers Club) in downtown Chicago, Krehbiel turned to recreating the urban landscapes, most of them within walking distance to his classrooms. These familiar scenes were painted between classes from the banks of the Chicago River. Most were painted during rush hour when automobiles and pedestrians populated the bridges and streets. He painted the Michigan Avenue Bridge and the Chicago River numerous times, each from a different perspective. Most of the images of the bridge were executed in 1920, the year of its grand opening, with the bridge towers draped in banners of red, white, and blue ribbons. Beginning in around 1926 and continuing through the early 1940s, Krehbiel created a series of synchromistic figure compositions in watercolor and in oil on small, unstretched pieces of canvas and, in the latter years, in pastel and in oil on larger canvases as well. The figures in this series reproduce the postures of models in his art classes and, while naturalistic at first, they gradually become geometric, even somewhat cubist. Krehbiel developed this new style into a method of teaching figure depiction by having students compose while drawing. Sketches of a three-figure model group, observed from various points in the room, would be rendered on a single sheet of paper ‚Äì or a series of quick poses by one model would be composed on a single sheet. He also produced a large number of landscapes in this synchromistic and relatively abstract style beginning in 1926. Created mainly in Saugatuck, most of these works were done in pastel on paper. Death Throughout the years, Krehbiel painted continuously. From his sketches and paintings done while studying in Paris and his neoclassical murals to his impressionistic American Southwest works, Chicago street and river scenes, and wooded presentations of the rural Midwest to his synchromistic figure compositions and landscapes, he painted incessantly and in all seasons without regard for the elements. Albert Henry Krehbiel died from a heart attack on June 29, 1945, in Evanston, Illinois, while preparing for a traveling and painting trip through Illinois and Kansas. His death occurred a few days after his retirement from teaching at the Illinois Institute of Technology, although he had agreed to stay on at The Art Institute of Chicago for one more year.

The Act received the assent of the President of India on 5 June 2007 and became effective on Independence Day, 2007. The National Institutes of Technology Act is the second law for technical education institutions after the Indian Institutes of Technology Act of 1961. NITs are centrally funded technical institutes in India, with a campus in each Indian state. This Act declares them as institutions of national importance, along with the lines of the Indian Institutes of Technology (IITs) and makes them eligible for a larger amount of funding and support from the Indian Government. The Act also aims at unifying the organisational structure of the NITs and bringing them under the direct purview of the Ministry of Human Resource Department (MHRD). These institutions were previously governed by individual societies under the Societies Registration Act, 1860. Rationale The 17 Regional Engineering Colleges (RECs) (Bhopal, Allahabad, Kozhikode, Durgapur, Hamirpur, Kurukshetra, Jalandhar, Jamshedpur, Jaipur, Nagpur, Rourkela, Silchar, Srinagar, Surathkal, Surat, Tiruchirappalli, and Warangal) were established in the major states of India as a cooperative venture between the central and respective state governments. In 2002, the Indian government decided to upgrade all RECs to NITs and later raised a few other reputed government colleges in subsequent years (for instance, Patna, Raipur and Agartala) to NIT status. After the upgrade NITs were completely under central government control. The Institutes provided potential choice for the government to replicate the IIT system and the Indian government decided to give these Institutes more autonomous powers. Benefit to the NITs With the NIT Act, the societies governing the NITs ceased to exist and the institutes are placed directly under the administrative control of the HRD ministry with the boards of governors heading affairs. The chairperson of the board is appointed by the President of India, who will also be a visitor to each institute. The ministry will also have a say in the appointment of the Director and Deputy Director of each institute. The NITs have become a group of disciplined institutions and within few years, they have come a long way, based on the successful and sound foundation of REC system and with the elimination of dual control by state and central government. They have united together and successfully lobbied for Institute of National Importance status under NIT Act of 2007. With the new- found INI status, NITs shall be able to receive increased government funding and support, more freedom to implement various academic programs and increased attention nationally and internationally. NITs further plan to start NITNET for networking and implement NIT-Vision 2025 to launch ambitious academic and research programs. Individual institutes will be permitted to start new programs catering to the needs of the local industry and wind up unpopular courses. The focus will be on nanotechnology and biotechnology. Plans are afoot to start integrated courses in science and technology along with dual degree programs both at undergraduate and postgraduate levels. NITs have been told to increase the student intake in the next five years, with the number of students being doubled to that of the existing strength. The MHRD Ministry plans to increase the number of the research fellowships, with as many as 60 to 70 being granted to each institute to enable students to concentrate on new topics of interest. Existing laboratories and libraries will also be upgraded. Amendments The National Institutes of Technology, Science Education and Research (Amendment) Bill, 2016 was introduced in Lok Sabha by Prakash Javadekar, Minister of Human Resource Development, on 19 July 2016 to bring NIT in Andhra Pradesh under this act. It was passed by Lok Sabha on 21 July 2016 and Rajya Sabha on 1 August 2016.

It is aged by storing them dry. The taste is first slightly sweet, but the aftertaste is pungent and bitter. According to Chinese herbology, its attribute is warm. Chenpi has a common name, ‚Äòju pi‚Äô or mandarin orange peel. Chenpi contains volatile oils which include the chemical compounds nobiletin, hesperidin, neohesperidin, tangeridin, citromitin, synephrine, carotene, cryptoxanthin, inositol, vitamin B1, and vitamin C. Traditional Chinese herbal medicine uses the alcohol extracts of several citrus peels, including those extracted from mandarin orange and bitter orange.  Identification  Sun-dried tangerine peels (chenpi) Since the products produced in Xinhui are purported to be the best quality, it is often called Xinhui Pi or Guang Chen Pi. It is normally cut into shreds before serving and presenting in the raw form.  History  The practice of using citrus peels in traditional Chinese medicine originated from Song Dynasty and has lasted for seven hundred years. Chenpi was of high popularity through the Ming and Qing Dynasties. It was shipped to foreign provinces by businessmen from Xinhui in Guangdong. A famous Qing doctor named Ye Gui (1667-1746) prescribed Chenpi as one of the ingredients in ‚ÄòErchen Tang‚Äô, a decoction consisting of two old drugs. Chenpi business brought wealth to Xinhui peasants and it also extended to food processing, logistics areas which forms a food production chain. However, there was a decline of Chenpi business in the 1990s until late 2002 when Chenpi farmers helped set up the Chenpi Industrial Association with support from Xinhui Agriculture Bureau and Business Federation, and Chenpi has regained its popularity since.  Production method  Xinhui chenpi is famous for its special production technique, where emphasis is put on peeling and storage methods. People can also do it at home.  Preparation  Prior to consumption, chenpi is soaked and rinsed with cold water until it becomes soft; the soaking time is recommended to be no longer than half an hour with a view to retaining its flavor. Afterwards, the white pith is gently scraped off from the softened peel.  Uses  = Cuisine = Some tong sui desserts such as red bean soup will use this ingredient occasionally. Chenpi is used to make the Hunanese dish orange chicken. It can be also used for other kinds of food and beverages such as porridge, duck, pigeon, mooncakes, green bean soup, jam, and wine. Chenpi-infused tea can also be prepared. = Medicine = Chenpi is a common ingredient in traditional Chinese medicine, where it is believed that it regulates ch'i (or qi), fortifies the spleen, eliminates dampness, improves abdominal distension, enhances digestion, and reduces phlegm.Yeung. Him-Che. Handbook of Chinese Herbs and Formulas. 1985. Los Angeles: Institute of Chinese Medicine. There is a well-known Chenpi-derived medicine named ‚Äòsnake gallbladder and tangerine peel powder‚Äô. The powder is used for heart disharmonies.  Precautions  Traditional Chinese medicine urges caution in using Chenpi when red symptoms occur such as red tongue or redness in the face.  Availability  Whole citrus peel is readily available from most herbal markets and specialty food stores. Some stores also sell citrus peel powder or capsules. Starting from around 2010, extensive land development for commercial and residential use in China has caused the decrease of farmland, especially in Xinhui, affecting the supply of Xinhui citrus and consequently Chenpi production. This in turn has contributed to a steep increase in the price of Chenpi. Based on data in late 2014, Xinhui Chenpi aged one year costs around 140 HKD per kilogram while those aged 10 years cost 600 to 800 HKD per kilo. Chenpi stored for more than 20 years can reach as nearly as 24,000 RMB per kilogram. 65-year Chenpi even costs 23,000 RMB per tael. Wholesale price of Chenpi costs 40 to 70 HKD per pound.

He spent 13 senior seasons with Rio Ave, having joined the club at the age of 9. He totalled 132 Primeira Liga matches, including one for Porto and four for Portimonense. Club career Born in Vila do Conde, Vilas Boas spent his entire youth career with hometown club Rio Ave FC. He made his professional debut on 10 March 2002, playing the first 49 minutes of a 1‚Äì0 home loss against C.D. Nacional in the second division. On 29 July 2003, Vilas Boas joined FC Porto, being assigned to their reserves. He joined on a season-long loan with the option of a three-year permanent move at the end, and his one first-team appearance came on 11 January 2004 in a 2‚Äì0 Primeira Liga away victory over F.C. Pa√ßos de Ferreira, as a last-minute substitute for Maniche. Vilas Boas returned to Rio Ave in 2005, with the side now in the top division. On 20 May 2010, he left on a free transfer to C.S. Mar√≠timo, signing a two- year deal. He arrived injured, and his input was limited to their second team before he was loaned to Portimonense S.C. of the same league on 14 January 2011, for the rest of the campaign. On 31 August 2011, Vilas Boas secured a deadline-day switch to his hometown club. He was part of the side in 2013‚Äì14 that lost the Ta√ßa de Portugal and Ta√ßa da Liga finals to S.L.

The book holds that ignorance of, or carelessness with the application of various 'Laws of Metaphysics' (see below) can bring about undesirable life events. Spiritual concepts discussed in the book Some of the Spiritual ideas Shinn explains in the book: * The Law of Expectancy: Shinn emphasizes the power of the imagination to bring about life events: \\"Whatever man feels deeply or images clearly, is impressed upon the subconscious mind, and carried out in minutest detail.\\" * The power of words: \\"Jesus Christ taught that man's words played a leading part in the game of life. 'By your words ye are justified and by your words ye are condemned'.\\" [Matthew 12:37] * The Divine Pattern and Intuition: Shinn says that one must always ask for the \\"right\\" circumstance, or the \\"Divine selection,\\" and not to ask for specifics. * The Law of Substitution: According to Florence Scovel Shinn, sometimes our desires are misdirected: \\"Many people are in ignorance of their true destinies and are striving for things and situations which do not belong to them, and would only bring failure and dissatisfaction if attained.\\" * The Law of Karma: the Law of Karma is also known as the Law of Cause and Effect: \\"Whatsoever a man soweth that shall he also reap.\\" This means that whatever man sends out in word or deed, will return to him; what he gives, he will receive. * The Law of Non Resistance: The Law of Non Resistance may be considered a sensible corollary to the Law of Karma, i.e. do not react to a negative situation with more negativity, as that will bring back more harm down the track. * The Law of Forgiveness: Though Karma is a powerful law, Shinn explains that the Law of Forgiveness or Grace is a higher law. \\"Christianity is founded upon the law of forgiveness - Christ has redeemed us from the curse of the Karmic law, and the Christ within each man is his Redeemer and Salvation from all inharmonious conditions.\\" * The Law of Use: Shinn explains that a gift is a better investment than a savings account. \\"Many people are in ignorance of the fact that gifts and things are investments, and that hoarding and saving invariably lead to loss.\\" * The Law of Love: Shinn quotes Jesus when she explains the importance of love. \\"Every man on this planet is taking his initiation in love. \\"A new commandment I give unto you, that ye love one another.\\" Influences Scovel Shinn's writing shares some common beliefs with Mary Baker Eddy, and there is some shared terminology. e.g. 'Infinite Spirit', 'Mortal Mind', 'Treatment', 'Demonstration' and 'Native Nothingness'. However her writing style is more familiar and less verbose than that of Mary Baker Eddy. As in Christian Science, Florence Scovel Shinn questions the reality of evil: \\"Jesus Christ said: \\"Resist not evil,\\" for He knew in reality, there is no evil, therefore nothing to resist. Also Scovel Shinn makes less of the illusion of matter, an argument that dominates Mary Baker Eddy's work Science and Health With Key to the Scriptures. Scovel Shinn's emphasis on the power of the spoken word may have been influenced by Emma Curtis Hopkins. Florence Scovel's books are widely discussed and admired in Unity Churches around the globe. Books and writing Unable to find a publisher for The Game of Life and How to Play It she published it herself in 1925. \\"Your Word is Your Wand\\" was published in 1928 and The Secret Door to Success was published in 1940 shortly before her death on October 17, 1940. The Power of the Spoken Word is a compendium of her notes, gathered by a student and published posthumously in 1945. In 2014, \\"Your Word Is Your Wand\\" was released as an audiobook.

The adapter could be a small solid circle that fits onto the spindle (meaning only one 45 could be played at a time) or a larger adapter that fits over the entire spindle of a record changer, permitting a stack of 45s to be played. These are often referred to as 45 spindles. A few manufacturers supplied a complete change of spindle for 45s. The first 45 rpm inserts were introduced by the Webster-Chicago Corporation, also known as Webcor. They were made of solid zinc, difficult to insert into a record and almost impossible to remove without breaking the disc. A differently shaped, but similarly difficult-to-use metal adapter was made by Fidelitone. Capitol Records for a time produced what they called \\"Optional Center\\" or \\"O.C. 45\\" records. These had a triangular section molded in with an LP-size spindle hole that could be punched out for playing on 45 rpm spindles. Some EMI and other British records have a similar feature. The EMI version is circular, with four small notches holding the center part onto the rest of the record.  The Spider  The former RCA Corporation introduced a snap-in plastic insert known as a spider Scratch-Free Phono, Popular Mechanics Aug 1962 Volume 118 Accessed via Google Books July 8, 2014 to make 45 rpm records compatible with the smaller spindle size of a 33‚Öì rpm LP record player. Commissioned by RCA president David Sarnoff and invented by Thomas Hutchison, spiders were prevalent in the 1960s and sold tens of millions per year. The Hutchison adapter included small bumps called \\"drive pins,\\" which locked the adapters together while revolving, thus preventing the stacked records from slipping against each other. Several manufacturers made \\"spider\\" adapters in slightly varying shapes and many different colors, though yellow and red were most frequently used.  The SX2  SX2 adapterThe SX2 and The Extender were designed and manufactured by Mark McLaughlan between the early 1980s and early 1990s.Boston Globe, August 25, 1991 Accessed via Boston Globe Archives McLaughlan, a Boston area nightclub DJ, came up with the design to make 7\\" discs easier to handle when mixing. The original design (The Extender) was made up of a platter die-cut from sheets of plastic that McLaughlan would drive on the hood of his car from the supplier in Cambridge, MA to the die- cutter in Ipswich, MA. He would then do the final assembly (bonding a lathe cut acrylic center and a foam pad) and packaging by hand. The SX2 (Single Extender, Rev 2) was manufactured by plastic injection at Spirit, Inc. in Wakefield, Massachusetts. One of the main design revisions, required was a series of 'ribs' on the underside of the platter to prevent warping from the extreme changes in temperature during the manufacturing process. A raised barrier was also added to contain the head in the event of miscuing and a polished surface inside the barrier to minimize damage to the stylus. Due to its limited manufacturing run the SX2 has become a sought after rarity among pro DJs.

It is set in a land where men can bestow on each other a number of endowments, granting the recipient attributes such as increased strength, a more acute sense of hearing, or better eyesight. The novel combines traditional sword and sorcery elements of fantasy with its own unique magic system of endowments.  Plot summary  In this novel, the main character Fallion returns to Castle Coorm in Mystarria, following his defeat of Shadoath. There he finds The One True Tree reborn, but it is surrounded by a twisted Seal of the Inferno. Fallion tries to heal the rune, only to discover that it was a trap left by the Queen of the Loci, in the form of Shadoath. The only thing he can do to save himself is to combine his world with the other linked to the Seal of the Inferno. The two worlds crash together with some unexpected results. For example, some people who happen to be standing in the wrong place recover from the melding of the two worlds to discover that they have a vine growing through their hand. Others combine with the version of themselves from the other world to produce a hybrid, but those whose other self has died or was never born are weakened. In this new world, a race of men who are several feet taller than the men from Fallion's world are locked in a mortal struggle with a race called wyrmlings. The wyrmlings are light- sensitive, and are approximate to the Inkharrans from Fallion's world and they carry parasitic wyrms inside them (like the loci of Fallion's world). They are led by Death Lords and Knights Eternal, undead creatures that perform the will of the Queen of the Loci. The battle between wyrmlings and men is at an uneasy truce because each holds a captive of the other race--the wyrmlings hold the prince Areth (the equivalent of Fallion's father, Gaborn, the Earth King) and the men hold the princess of the wyrmlings, Kan-hazur. Even though the Knights Eternal are rumored to be impossible to slay except in daylight, Fallion and Jaz manage to kill one before they are taken captive by one named Vulgnash. This earns them the respect of the warrior men of that world. Those men, led by High King Urstone (who is the equivalent of Fallion's grandfather on this world), mount a rescue of Fallion and his companions. The legendary Daylan Hammer is present on this new world and he convinces the King to try to exchange hostages with the wyrmlings because it is immoral to keep the princess hostage. The wyrmlings pretend to make the exchange and then ambush the men. This is followed by an all-out attack on the main fortress of the men, Caer Luciare. During this battle the High King is slain, as well as Jaz, and Fallion is again taken by the Knight Eternal, Vulgnash. The wyrmlings make a deal with Prince Areth to spare his people if he'll accept a wyrm. The Queen of the Loci accepts him as her host and then he uses his new power as Earth King to Choose all of the wyrmling horde for the (twisted) Earth.

RAF career Born in Northampton on 11 June 1914, Mann joined the Royal Air Force Volunteer Reserve in Reading in 1938. As a sergeant pilot (Service No. 127025),http://www.battleofbritain1940.net/bobhsoc/ he was posted in July 1940 to No. 64 Squadron RAF, flying Spitfires. He was shot down by Royal Navy anti- aircraft fire on 16 August. He was then posted to No. 92 Squadron in late August, and was wounded in action on 14 September. He was subsequently posted to No. 91 Squadron, but on 4 April 1941 was again shot down and wounded, being badly burned. His opponent was either Oberst Adolf Galland or Leut. Robert Menge of JG 26. He underwent plastic surgery at Queen Victoria Hospital, East Grinstead, so becoming a member of the Guinea Pig Club. He was also awarded a Distinguished Flying Medal. Mann met his wife Dilys Pritchard ‚Äì known as \\"Sunnie\\" ‚Äì in wartime London, where Sunnie was an ambulance driver and Mann was recovering from his burns. They married at Chiswick Registry Office in 1943. Following his recovery, Mann joined 1 ADF at Hendon, and then served with Ferry Command over the North Atlantic routes.Aces High, Shores & Williams 1994, p. 424. His final fighter score was 5 destroyed, 1 probable, and 3 damaged. He was later promoted to the rank of Squadron Leader. Post-war life After the war Mann served as Chief Pilot with Middle East Airlines. He and Sunnie moved to Lebanon, where they continued to live for over 40 years. After retiring, Mann ran the Pickwick pub; while Sunnie ran a successful riding school. Kidnapping On 13 May 1989, Mann was kidnapped in Beirut by Khalaya al-Kifah al-Musallah or \\"Armed Struggle Cells\\", a previously unknown terrorist group linked to the pro-Iranian Shi'ite Muslim militant organisation, Hezbollah. The group demanded the release of Palestinian prisoners it claimed were being held in Britain, accused of killing Palestinian cartoonist Naji al-Ali in 1987. (In fact, no-one linked to the murder was being held by UK authorities.) The British embassy had warned three days before Mann was seized that a Shi'a group was preparing to take another Western hostage. The Foreign Office and embassy had renewed warnings to British citizens still living in Beirut to leave immediately following the Salman Rushdie affair in February of that year. In September 1989,BBC News, 8 September 1989. it was reported that his wife Sunnie had been told that Mann was dead, by a man who asked to meet her in a Beirut shopping centre. Release Mann was eventually released on 24 September 1991 after negotiations by the British and US governments succeeded in bringing about the release of several Western hostages. He had been held at the same time as other UK and Irish hostages in Lebanon, notably journalist John McCarthy, church envoy Terry Waite and author Brian Keenan. On his release, he was taken firstly to Damascus, Syria, where he was reunited with his wife, and then flown by VC10 to RAF Lyneham in Wiltshire, and spent some time recuperating and debriefing in the Officers' Mess, before returning to normal life. His health had suffered greatly during his captivity, and he never recovered. He had been kept for prolonged periods in solitary confinement, sometimes in chains. He lost over 18 kilograms in weight, and experienced heart and lung problems. He also suffered from a skin problem, requiring medication, resulting from his Second World War burns injuries. After his release, the Manns settled in Nicosia, Cyprus. Jackie was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire in 1992. The couple wrote a book in 1992 entitled Yours Till The End: Harrowing Life of a Beirut Hostage. Sunnie also wrote Holding On in 1991. Sunnie Mann died in November 1992 from lung cancer.

In reality, there are only six springs from this network that still exist, following destruction of one in the early 1990s, to allow the construction of residential homes. The remaining sections of the Sete Fontes are identifiable for the springs that are housed within their respective M√£e de aguas (\\"mother of waters\\"), which are connected via aqueducts running along the surface or through tunnels, known as minas (\\"mines\\"). History The system is located on the outskirts of the civil parish of S√£o Victor close to the ancient Roman Geira (also known as \\"Route XVIII\\"). There is speculation that these springs may date to the Roman occupation, when Braga was then known as Bracara Augusta. For Braga, the necessity to support its population, came from its archbishops, which were preoccupied with these issued at least until the 16th century. Until the beginning of that century, D. Diogo de Sousa had brought water from Fonte dos Granginhos, in 1531 until Fonte de Santiago and Fonte da Pracinha, while (at the same time) constructing the fountain of Carcova, building a fountain in the Largo do Pa√ßo. The main sections of the system were constructed between 1744 and 1752, under the patronage of Archbishop D. Jos√© de Bragan√ßa (1741‚Äì1756), although it is known that his predecessor D. Rodrigo de Moura Telles (1704‚Äì1728) already completed portions of the network: first deposit dates to 1752. D. Jos√© became interested in this issue immediately after arrive in Braga, starting in August 1741, and continuing at a steady rhythm until 1744. For his part, D. Rodrigo de Moura Telles supplied water to the Hospital of S√£o Marcos and substituted this fountain with another (the Fountain of Castelos). Friar D. Caetano Brand√£o (1790‚Äì1805) ordered the opening of the Mina dos orphaons (\\"Mine of the Orphans\\") around 1804 to supply water to the institution which he founded. By 1914, the network continued to function. Until the beginning of water treatment and supply from the C√°vado River in 1914, the Sete Fontes was the main source of water for the city. It continued to be used until 1929, even as water continues to flow through the system. Still today water is running through the system. Although the Sete Fontes was mentioned within the city plans of Braga as late as 1994, as an important resource, beginning in the mid-1990s several developments put in cause the protection of the historical system. The Mina de Adelino Correia was destroyed in 1995, with rumour developing that the stones were stored somewhere in Braga. On 18 April 1995, a dispatch was authorized for the system's evaluation for consideration as a national monument. = Preservation = An interior perspective of the water junction in the Mina of Dr. Sampaio The 1999 city plan indicated that the upper portion of the Sete Fontes was to be destroyed in order to provide space for the construction of an extension to the national road network. During public consultations in 2003, regarding this planned 4-lane roadway, engineers indicated the need to destroy half of the Sete Fontes in order to build the expansion. The initial Environmental impact assessment (EIA) noted that at least five of the aqueducts and many of minas would be affected by this construction project, but researchers at the Instituto Portugu√™s do Patrim√≥nio Arquitect√≥nico (IPPAR), stated the project could be completed, if proper monitoring was accomplished, noting that the aqueducts should be restored after the construction was completed. The area occupied by the Sete Fontes is located in an area designated for urban expansion within the municipal plan. Many of the parcels were purchased by real estate companies and/or developers, without submitting plans for the system's preservation and rehabilitation. Although, the municipal authorities had indicated their desire to preserve the Sete Fontes as a National monument and transform the area into a municipal park, the area continued to be identified for construction and road redevelopment, in the municipal plan. In the 1999-2000 municipal plan, three of the upper minas fell within an area classified as \\"public utility\\" and were zoned for the construction of a hospital in 2002. Yet, these lands were also classified for use by the Portuguese armed forces. On one occasion, the municipal government had attempted to impede the re-classification process for the system. Concerning nationally sensitive heritage sites, Portuguese law states that the authorized patrimonial agency (IPPAR, IGESPAR or DRCNorte) has to give explicit approval for projects within of a designated structure, or group of structures. There have been no approvals under its classification file. In 2009, in order to remedy the planned construction, Estradas de Portugal suggested the construction of a bridge over Sete Fontes. In 2008, a large section of the lands, , were put on sale: these included the parcels that covered the Minas das Verdosas 1, Minas das Verdosas 2, Mina dos Orf√£os, Mina do Respiro (near Mina das Freiras), and half Mina das Freiras, that also included various aqueducts and underground galleries. The president of the local Junta Freguesia of S√£o Vitor thinks attempted to obtain clarification as to the status of the Sete Fontes, and the sale of these lands. Approaching the municipal authorities, on several occasions, the president had not received any answers. Yet, the director of the Dire√ß√£o Regional de Cultura do Norte (DRCNorte) also confirmed that there were promises to build on lands of theSete Fontes. Inadvertently, this was also supported by claims on building densities for the area of Sete Fontes, where the municipal authority indicated that proposed densities were 25% less than first expected, in the detailed plan for Sete Fontes. Opposition politicians within the municipal council suggested that landowners within the Sete Fontes should trade their lands for others in the region, a process that was successfully implemented with the construction of the municipal stadium. By trading lands with local developers, it was assumed that the city could ensure a 20 hectare greenspace (that included the Sete Fontes), and a park of 56 hectares. At the time of the construction of the local hospital, the site-plan for the building partially covered the Sete Fontes complex. When contacted, the Instituto de Gest√£o do Patrim√≥nio Arquitect√≥nico e Arqueol√≥gico (IGESPAR), the patrimonial agency responsible for the site, claimed that they were unaware of the situation: the construction company had ignored the presence of Sete Fontes. During the construction, representatives of the construction company expelled at least one of the archaeologists, that by law were required to accompany the progress of the construction. This followed the drainage of loose soil downstream by rainwater, into the area of the Sete Fontes, that impaired the structural integrity of at least one of the underground galleries, altered the landscape and created ditches, affecting the Mina dos Orf√£os. During the building process, Roman ruins were discovered within the area. At least one ventilation shaft for the underground gallery leading water to Mina dos Orf√£o was disturbed. At the end of 2008, the builders erected a fence just within the minimum demarcation zone required by Portuguese law. The Mina das Verdosas 2, and its underground gallery, were demolished in February 2011 because of a new road. The authorities (DRCNorte, Estradas de Portugal and the cabinet chief of the Secretary of State for Culture) claimed that both Mina das Verdosas 1 and 2 were never part of Sete Fontes (but in reality were never included in the IPPAR/IGESPAR classification process). In addition, both Estradas de Portugal and Braga Municipal Council claimed that the access road to the hospital would not affect Sete Fontes. By early 2011, the city's geographical information system platform continued to classify most of the terrains as suitable for construction (except for those included within the hospital's construction zone). = Monument = Since most of the remaining sections of the complex are on private land the process of conserving and promoting the group has been difficult. The non-governmental organization Associa√ß√£o para a Defesa, Estudo e Divulga√ß√£o do Patrim√≥nio Cultural e Natural (\\"Association for the Defence, Study and Promotion of the Natural and Cultural Patrimony\\") had, for a long period of time, been promoting the Sete Fontes as a National monument. The organization petitioned the IPPAR on 27 March 1995 to classify the Sete Fontes as a national monument, in dispatch 95/3-15 (1). A process was begun shortly after this request. In 2001, a proposal for the general protection zone was published, and signed by the mayor of Braga, but many structures of the Sete Fontes were excluded from the ZPE, including the two Minas das Verdosas (1 and 2), as well as the final aqueduct to Rua de Areal em Cima, which did not mention the water basin. In 2003, Sete Fontes was placed on the official evaluation for national monument status, and in May 2003, after the proposal of the IPPAR, the signed the Minister of Culture signed the decree. In May 2009, the Ministry of Culture suggested setting up Zona de Protec√ß√£o Especial (ZPE) around the Sete Fontes complex, which was published later that year (although the official definition of the ZPE was never defined). Specifically, although many of the sections of the Sete Fontes were included, the areas around Minas das Verdosas (1 and 2) and aqueduct of Rua Areal em Cima were not included. The establishment of the ZPE, included provisions for public consultation and feedback, although all claims and suggestions were summarily turned down. A petition undersigned by over 6000 persons was handed over to the president of the Portuguese parliament in mid-2010. A parliamentary committee discussed these issues, and debate occurred in parliament, after which two official statements were issued indicating the support of classifying Sete Fontes as a national monument. By law, the Sete Fontes had to be classified by end of 2010, otherwise the classification would be annulled, but on the final day of 2010, the process was extended for another year. The Portuguese Council of Ministers, on 3 March 2011 decreed that they would be proceeding with the classification of Sete Fontes as a national monument, with the official notification occurring in the Portuguese official journal (Di√°rio da Rep√∫blica), published in 2011, which also included the definition of the special zone of protection (ZPE). A large part of the ZPE, as defined, continues to be occupied by the hospital and its access roads. The water Of the original aqueduct system, there still are some 13 springs providing potable water, regularly maintained by the municipal water supply division. This branch conducts periodic analysis of the water's quality, maintains a two-person staff to maintain and clean the system. The Sete Fontes continues to be used as a water resource, integrated within the city of Braga's strategic plan and providing water to fountains of the town squares Largo do Pa√ßo and Largo Carlos Amarante. There is one public faucet, the Bica P√∫blica das Sete Fontes (near Mina do Dr. Amorim) that is regularly maintained and monitored (almost monthly) by the local authority of S√£o V√≠tor. There also was a faucet (Po√ßa da Monte? near Mina das Verdosas 1), but it was destroyed when the access road to the hospital was built. The name Sete Fontes gives the impression that at some time there were 7 springs. In the official document defining the special protection zone (ZEP) one can count 14 endings of underground galleries, each should be a spring. But this counting ignores three underground galleries (Adelino Correia, Julio Lima and Verdosas), the spring in Respiro 1 and possibly some more springs along the underground galleries (e.g. the so-called chambers in Mina dos Orfaons and it's unclear whether one should count 1 or 2 springs for Mina das Freiras). Also, M√£e d'√†gua do Dr Sampaio receives water from two aqueducts that not marked on the official map of the ZEP. So at its peak there were at least 20 springs at Sete Fontes. The S√£o Vitor regularly tests the water coming out of the faucet near M√£e d'√†gua Amorim (actually coming from a tube placed in the Capela). Since the measurements started the water has always been found to be considered suitable for drinking. A water treatment analysis evaluation from the civil parish of S√£o V√≠tor certifying the quality of its waters The water basin seems to be mainly fed by rain water in the valley of Sete Fontes. The water flux response is in most springs quite quick to rain and some springs give very little water in dry periods giving the impression that the spring water is mostly rain water rather than coming from underground aquifer under pressure. The mineral content of the water various both in time and place. The same spring can give different levels depending on the flux of water, many increase mineralisation with higher flux. The lower lying springs in general yield higher mineral content that those at higher altitudes, but there are also differences for some elements that does not follow this trend. This has been attributed both to differences in sediment and rock layer throughout the system but also influences of domestic, industrial waste water and agricultural fertilisers seeping into the ground water. Architecture The Sete Fontes complex consists of a cluster of aqueducts and structures stretching over in the parish of S√£o V√≠tor. The network is segmented into 14 underground galleries and six junctions in an ensemble built in stone. The more prominent features of this system, are the commonly referred to as M√£es de √Ågua (\\"Mothers of Water\\"). These structures are built in the Baroque-style, consisting of a cylindrical structure and vaulted dome, trimmed by a circular cornice and topped with pinnacles. Each M√£es de √Ågua is decorated with a coat of arms representing its patron. Although rarely used in their identification today, the M√£es de √Ågua include (from the highest elevation): Mina do Dr. Amorim (1752), Mina do Dr. Nozes, Mina do Dr. Sampaio, Mina dos √ìrf√£os (1804), Mina das Freiras, Mina do Dr. Alvim (de cima), Mina do Dr. Alvim (de baixo) (1744), Mina Preta, Mina das Verdosas 1, Mina das Verdosas 2 (destroyed in 2011) and Mina de Xedas/Chedas and Mina de Adelino Correia (destroyed in 1995). There are also two untitled cylindrical structures, breathers (), near the Mina dos √ìrf√£os and Mina das Freiras. The Sete Fontes is a unique specimen of 18th-century Portuguese engineering, that includes the creation of galleries and visitors chambers, the layout of underground and surface channeling of water, and the attempt to follow the valley's natural topography. The pipes are delicate works, its elements fitting snugly together, its waters branching across the system for almost between junctions. Short description of the various structures  =Names of the different types of structures= Apart from old documents at the Mayor's Office there are at least four documents that include the names of the structures of Sete Fontes: * Maria Rodrigues 2012, Hidrodin√¢mica do sistema de capta√ß√£o das Sete Fontes : contributo para o ordenamento do territ√≥rio do Munic√≠pio de Braga * Nascimento Fonseca 1937, Projeto de aproveitamento da √†gua das Minas das Sete Fontes. * Alberto Costa 1956, Mina das Sete Fonte : estrutura do complexo na zona de capta√ß√£o. * Plano Director Municipal de Braga 1999/2000 * Eduardo Pires Oliveira 2001, A Freguesia de S√£o Victor Braga There are some inconsistencies in the names. The above documents use different names for the same structures. Some parts are named of the land owner (at the time of naming: Sampaio and Amorim) and others are named after the institution that paid for its construction (e.g. Mina dos Orfaons and Mina do P√≥pulo). This also gave the constructor the right to a certain flux of water. The more emblematic structures are alternatively called M√£e d'√†gua (mother of water), castelo (castle), caixa (box) or c√∫pula (dome). The more simple entrances are called caixas (boxes) but sometimes person simply refer to the name of the underground gallery (mina). There are also three structures above ground which does not include a door, the respiros (breaths). Part of the aqueduct consists of tubings made out stone placed at ground level. There are also a number of underground springs (nascentes) but most of them have not been designated any specific name, except the one called the chapel (capela) in one of the side galleries of the Mina Ch√£ das Sete Fontes. It is a bit unclear when the complex got the name Sete Fontes. In the municipal archives the term Sete Fontes is used at least as early as 1737. Certainly much of the structures were in place by then, even though it that is before the dates engraved in many head stones, i.e. 1744, 1752, 1761 and 1804. =Structures visible above ground = Caixas The Caixas (boxes) are entrances to the underground galleries. The caixas are fairly simple structures in granite. Only one is adorned with a heraldic shield. Only one has both year and name inscribed. Sometimes they are referred to as \\"boca da mina\\" (mouth of the mine). Caixa da Mina do Dr Nozes =Caixa mina dos Nozes= Caixa mina do Dr Nozes (also known as: Mina das Nozes ). It is almost entirely below ground level, and the main portion is only visible when one stands next to it. There are two doors, the left one has a heraldic shield and a date. One leads to the main aqueduct, but is only to walk in a few meters. It has a heraldic shield with a year engraved, 1761 (or 1767). The other door leads to the underground gallery of Mina das Nozes. =Caixa mina do P√≥pulo= Simple structure, halfway sunken into the ground. It was rediscovered during clearing of trees in area in late 2014 (Oct/Nov?). Unknown interior. =Caixa mina dos Orfaons= Entrance to Mina dos Orfaons (also known as Mina dos Orf√£os and Mina dos Orf√£os de S√£o Caetano) named after the institution that paid for its constructions. Has the year 1804 engraved above the entrance. From here water leads in underground stone tubings to the nearby Respiro. =Caixa mina Preta= Entrance to the Mina Pinheiro de baixo (lower pine tree mine), also known as Mina Preta (black mine). Simple construction with a rusted metal door. A metal pipe is seen leading from it into the neighbouring M√£e d'√†gua do Dr Alvim de baixo. Some parts of the system was retrofitted with metal tubings in the first half of the 20th century. =Caixa mina das Chedas= Simple structure with metal door. It is also known as Mina das Xedas. From it leads an aqueduct of stone pipes ca 20 metres down to the main aqueduct (conduta geral). =Caixa das Verdosas 1= Caixa das Verdosas 1 (also known as Mina Versosas) was partially destroyed when building the access road to the hospital. Simple structure. The water is not obviously leading to any aqueduct. Drawings from 1937 indicate an aqueduct leading to M√£e d'√†gua do Dr Alvim de baixo. The nearby house use the water for irrigation. =Caixa das Verdosas 2= Caixa das Verdosas 2 (also known as Mina Julio Lima and Lavarincho) was completely destroyed/dismantled during the construction of the access road to the hospital. A mock up entrance was constructed afterwards. J√∫lio Lima had a property in the parish of S√£o Vicente. There is a street called \\"Rua das Verdosas\\" nearby this (former) underground gallery. A dug down aqueduct (stone piping) leads down to M√£e d'√†gua do Dr Alvim de baixo. =Caixa mina Adelino Correia= Was destroyed in 1995. Drawings from early 20th depict a simple structure with junction between the aqueduct from Mina Adelino Correia and the main aqueduct (conduta geral : main conduit). M√£es d'√°gua M√£e d'√°gua means mother of water, this is misleading since there are no springs inside, just junctions of aqueducts. They are similar in build: cylindrical, with an entrance and rounded cupula. In 2014 they were all given a new whitish coat of cement. Inside is a \\"separation swirl\\" where the aqueducts meet, this lets sand and silt deposit thus removing from them the flowing water. The three upper have entrances to the underground whereas the lowest only has aqueducts coming, and also acts as the tool shed for the \\"aqueceiros\\" (the water men).

With big heraldic shield of the Bragan√ßa famility and the year 1752 engraved above the entrance. Water leads from two underground galleries: Mina Ch√£ das Sete Fontes (from south east) and Mina dos Ribeirinhos (from north east). From here the water leads in an underground aqueduct (stone pipes) til Caixa Mina do Dr Nozes. =M√£e d'√°gua do Dr Sampaio= Cylindrical structure (also called caixa n 3) which receives water from Mina do P√≥pulo and Caixa da Mina do Dr Nozes (conduta geral). The former is quite simple in its finish. As it leads in the M√£e d'√°gua one can find an outline drawing of the adornation at the top of this M√£e d'√°gua. Inside is a \\"separation swirl\\". From here the main conduit in a ground level stone tubings continues down to the respiro next Mina dos Orfaos. Next to the entrance is an Egyptian style eye engraved into the stones of a low wall. =M√£e d'√°gua do Dr Alvim em cima= Cylindrical structure (also called caixa n 5 and M√£e d'√°gua Gemea de cima: upper twin mother of water) with the year 1744 engraved above the entrance. It receives water from the main conduit (via the Respiro next to Mina dos Orfaons) and Mina do Pinheiro de cima (upper pine tree mine) which in turns receives water from Mina das Freiras (nuns' mine). It has as \\"separation swirl\\" inside. From here the main conduit in a ground level stone tubings continues down to M√£e d'√°gua do Dr Alvim de baixo. =M√£e d'√°gua do Dr Alvim em baixo= Very similar to its twin (caixa n 6 and called the lower twin) and also with 1744. It receives water from 3 directions: 1. Main conduit (from the upper twin), 2. Mina Preta (Mina Pinheiro de baixo) and 3 Minas Julio Lima (Lavarincho / Verdosas 2) and Verdosas (Verdosas 1). The latter have dried out (see more in the below sections on the aqueduct). Inside is a \\"separation swirl\\". Only tubings leads here. Notably an iron tubing from Mina Preta, which obviously is not part of the original design. From here the water leads into town in the main down conduit at ground level via the now destroyed Mina do Adelino Correia. Respiros The structures called respiros (breaths) or ventosa (cup) with small openings at the top have unclear function. All three of them a situated on top of a spring, from which lead an underground gallery (mina). A popular hypothesis is that somehow the underground galleries need to breathe in order not to create suction that would prevent the water to flow. But the entrances which recently were given doors would yield ample flux of air through the underground galleries. Perhaps it is more to let bats in so that they can eat bugs living in there. Sete Fontes (28).JPGRespiro da Mina das Freiras incorporated into the wall of First College Sete Fontes (26).JPGRespiro da Mina das Freiras, interior Sete Fontes - respiro.JPGRespiro 2 Sete Fontes (25).JPGRespiro 2, interior Sete Fontes (11).JPGRespiro 1, interior, water from the main conduit Sete Fontes (13).JPGRespiro 1, interior, spring =Respiro 1= Cylindrical structure with a flat roof with small holes in it (also called respiro 1). Has its own spring and receives water from both the main conduit (via M√£e d'√†gua do Dr Sampaio) and Mina dos Orfaons. From outside it looks quite narrow but inside the base is it almost 3 meters wide, normally full with shallow water. At the top one can see a vault that inside the platform one sees from the outside, above which extends almost 3 meters of more narrow cylinder (ca 1 meter inner diameter). From here water leads in an underground gallery to M√£e d'√†gua dr Dr Alvim de cima. =Respiro 2= Cylindrical structure very similar to Respiro 1. From here water leads in an underground gallery to M√£e d'√†gua dr Dr Alvim de cima. From spring to rooms is more than five meters. Alas, the spring it once had dried out when the Mina Preta (Pinheiro de baixo) was built (or repaired) it essentially extends under this Respiro. =Respiro da Mina das Freiras= Octagonal structure with a pointy top ca two meters wide, also with holes in it. It has spring the only gives water after heavy rain, but also receives water from a spring in an upstream underground gallery. From spring to roof is ca 5 meters. From here the water leads in underground gallery to the underground gallery of Mina Pinheiro de cima. Aqueduct in stone tubes The tubings of the aqueduct seen at ground level is made out of local granite (there are two kinds in this area), and so is everything else. The sections are little over 1 meter long with square cross section of 4 dms and bore of 1dm radius. Each sections has male and female end with fits fairly snugly into its neighbour. Most have a square hole upwards which is capped with a stone and a kind of concrete. The same concrete is used to seal the gaps in the connections. The upper hole is opened in order to clean the tubings, especially to remove the so-called fox tails (raposas) which are bundles of tree roots invading the aqueducts. Some loose pieces of the aqueduct are on display next to M√£e de √†gua do Dr Alvim de cima. Setefontes1.jpgAqueduct in tubes made of stone. This interlinks some of the m√£es de √°gua in the Sete Fontes complex Sete Fontes.JPGOne of the covered aqueducts carrying water between each junction =Below MdA Sampaio= From here the main conduit is an unusually steep slope for ca 20 metres before it goes underground. =Above MdA Alvim em cima (two) = The two sections above Alvim em cima are actually the ceilings of underground galleries. =Below MdA Alvim em cima= The main conduit is almost horizontal here, and surrounded by meter-high walls on both sides. One side with stone, the other is mainly dirt, but eventually becomes the outer wall of Mina Preta. On some sections one can see the pillow (almofada) finish that is said be a Roman design. In some sections one can see wedge-formed grooves on the outer edges. This from the use of wooden wedges that are put in water to expand to cut the stones. =Below MdA Alvim em baixo= From here the main conduit leads to the conduit from Mina Chedas and to Adelino Correia. For a little over 100 metres the aqueduct is resting on stones, and is in fact above ground level. It makes some twists and turns on its way. On most days one can see water leaking out. During and after heavy rain the flux of leaks is quite dramatic. Some parts seems to have rows of stones creating a kind of external support structure. =Below Chedas= A short ground-level main conduit (ca 20 metres) leads into the main conduit. The stones in this section are much more uneven (less worked) than other sections. Sections do not have square cross sections. From here the ground level aqueduct leads to Adelino Correia. =Below Adelino Correira= It is unclear whether the section next to the former Mina Adelina Correia is still intact. The section is now underground because of the construction works here in 1995. There is an aqueduct upstream and downstream. Downstream the aqueduct is partially intact all the way until the road Rua Areal de cima. Some parts are contained within high stone walls, some parts are under or partially under residential buildings. The last bit til the Rua Areal de cima de aqueduct is placed in an \\"alley\\" between villas. From here in leads the underground aqueduct into town. Probably in more than one place aqueducts from other springs feed into the system (or did feed). =Structures below ground= The underground galleries are fairly unexplored. The guided tours normally only show the two underground galleries leading into Alvim de cima and Mina Ch√£ das Sete Fontes up to the chapel. The water man (aqueceiros) obviously have seen most of the system. But some parts, especially the sections under the parking lot of the new hospital are only good for crawling.

One of the sacred books of Tamil Saiva Siddhanta, Manikkavasagar's Tiruvacakam, originated from this shrine. Manikkavasagar is said to have converted the king to the religion of Shiva and built the temple with money that had been intended for war-horses. Legend The temple is supposed to have been built by Manickavasagar. Being the prime minister, he spent all the money given to him, to buy good horses in Chola Nadu, by the Varaguna Pandya II king to buy horses in building the temple.Footprint India.Roma Bradnock As he was bereft of money, Shiva displayed one of his Thiruvilayadal, a divine sport, by transforming foxes to horses, and once they were given to the king became foxes again. Architecture Athmanathar temple is a testimony to the temple architectural skills of ancient Tamil sculptors and engineers. The temple covers an area of over with three enclosures and faces south, constructed so that the setting sun strikes the sanctum even though it is cloistered within three circumambulatory paths. The presiding deity is formless (Atmanatar); there is no ≈öivalingam but only a pedestal {ƒÄvudayƒÅr} located in the sanctum, hence the name Avudayar Koil. The God faces South in this temple- in Dakshinamurthy or Guru form. His consort is worshipped as ≈öivayoganƒÅyaki(YogƒÅmbƒÅl) in iconless form. There is no Nandi bull icon as is conventional in almost all Shiva temples. There is deep spiritual significance in this. Hinduism allows deity worship for the novice. As one's devotion matures,one begins to contemplate the truth of formlessness of the Brahman. The temple has been designed to illustrate this theology. This one of the rarest Saivite shrine in whole of India to portray the supreme truth symbolically. Since the soul (athma) has no form, the deity is called Athmanathar.Tourist Guide to Tamil Nadu There are five lamps in the sanctum indicating the five time scales and 27 lamps indicating the 27 stars. Tirupperunthurai is also known as Kokozhi, ≈öivapuram, ƒÄkƒÅ≈õa KailƒÅsa, Vadav≈´r, Chaturvedamangalam and ƒÄdi KailƒÅsa in Sangam literature. It is also known as Atƒ´ta SabhƒÅ as it has six SabhƒÅ-s, namely KanakasabhƒÅ, ChitsabhƒÅ, SatsabhƒÅ, ƒÄnandasabhƒÅ, RatnasabhƒÅ and DevasabhƒÅ in comparison to five Sabhas at Chidambaram, each of these halls is named after Shaivite theological terms. These halls have exquisite carvings. It is believed that Manikkavacakar himself built these sabhas, and covered the Sabhas with 21600 plates of copper. Mother Parvathi in the Thillai Mandap in the second prakara granting the Pasupatha weapon to Arjuna as hunter and his wife is very realistic in workmanship. Mother appears with a chain around the neck, bangles in hand and holding a bag each carved in stone. Iron screws are use in some of the mantapams, which is unique for that age. The temple is noted for the zephyr(granite) roof work. The ceiling of the Kanga sabhai(golden hall) is a grandeur creation in stone. The ropes, rafters and nails all are made of granite.Concise classified dictionary of Hinduism.

The land to the west of Muckleford features sparse forest of Box Ironbark that was mined for gold in some areas during the 19th century.http://www.vgr.com.au/history.html This western forest contains many remnants of the local mining history including several open and covered holes and one poppet head used in shaft mining which belonged to the 'Red White and Blue' mine. Muckleford is crossed by several roads. Rilens Road, constructed solely of gravel, historically carried a single raised telephone wire on the north side of the road using wooden poles to service local farms and houses. It runs west starting from the Pyrenees Highway (Highway 6180), and crosses the Muckleford Walmer Road which runs north to south. Striking the Muckleford Creek it crosses over and then leads into a thin eucalypt forest. The Muckleford Walmer Road has several farms, a retired red brick church, and Muckleford Cemetery.http://www.australiancemeteries.com.au/vic/mt_alexander/muckleford.htm The Pyrenees Highway connects Castlemaine to Newstead. The Maldon to Castlemaine highway also cuts through Muckleford's regions and runs chiefly west to east. Adjacent to the Castlemaine Golf Club is the Castlemaine Steiner School & Kindergarten, which was founded in 1987.http://www.cssk.vic.edu.au Muckleford Creek rises below Walmer and eventually flows into the Loddon River. There is no large commercial shopping center located within the town to serve the scattered farms, houses, and occasional rural commerce. In the , it had a population of 1107.

This town was built to serve the needs of the prospectors and speculators which had risen to over 2000 persons. Within a year there were two hotels, Monk's and Simson's together with an Anglican school which was later replaced by a Government State School in 1877. Muckleford Post Office opened on 1 August 1857 and closed in 1966. A railway station was constructed to the north of the township, on the Castlemaine to Maldon line, in 1884 and became known as the Muckleford railway station. This station, along with a large goods shed has been restored and forms part of the Victorian Goldfields Railway line.

Situated from Oslo Central Station, it serves an hourly regional service operated by Vy. The station has two platforms and is itself located on an island platform, giving Skoppum a keilbahnhof design. The station building was designed by Balthazar Lange in Swiss chalet style. The station opened on 7 December 1881 and served as an interchange station between the Vestfold Line and the Horten Line. The latter was closed for passenger traffic in 1967 and demolished in 2009. Skoppum remains the only station serving Horten, despite being west of the town center. The current station is listed as a heritage site, but will be abandoned in about 2024 when a new section of high-speed rail is built. It may be replaced by a station west of the village or at Bakkenteigen. History The station in 1906, as seen from the southern road access When planning of the Vestfold Line commenced in 1871,Jakobsen: 13 there were three main proposals for a route. The outer followed the shore of the Oslofjord, would be and would run through Holmestrand, Horten and √Ösg√•rdstrand before reaching T√∏nsberg. The combined and inner would be , respectively, and both involved building a branch line to Horten. The main argument against the coastal route was that the towns already had a good steamship service, with several daily departures.Broch (1936): 99 A third major alternative was to bypass the coast altogether and build down the valley of L√•gendalen to Larvik.Broch (1936): 98 Shares for various routes were issued in 1873, and the coastal alternative proved to be the most popular.Broch (1936): 101 Still, the county politicians preferred an interior route when it applied for the government to build the line.Broch (1936): 100 Construction of the Jarlsberg and Horten Lines commenced in 1876.Broch (1936): 105 The lines were taken into use on 7 December 1881. The interchange station had the spelling Skopum until 1891.Bjerke & Holom: 214 Train at the station around the previous turn of the century Skoppum was a third-class station, given a more extensive design than many other stations serving rural areas because of its function as a transshipment station between the Vestfold Line and the Horten Line. The station originally consisted of an office for the station master, a ticket office, a waiting room and a restaurant, run by the station master's wife. Next to the station building there was a building for handling cargo. The station also originally contained a locomotive depot, water tower and a turntable. The depot had a place for a single locomotive, which was used on the Horten Line.Jakobsen: 34 At the time of the opening the station was staffed by a station mater, two telegraphists and two station workers. The station master lived in the four-room apartment in the upper story of the station building.Jakobsen: 36 Initially the Horten Line had four trains per direction per day, increasing to seven in 1884. It reached eleven during the 1920s and peaked with thirteen from 1946.Aspenberg (1994): 140 Travel time was initially 16 minutes between Skoppum and Horten.Jakobsen: 125 The line's patronage peaked in the 1920, when ca. 200,000 annual passengers were transported along with between 5,000 and 15,000 tonnes of cargo.Aspenberg (1994): 143 An interlocking system was installed on 19 February 1934. Though their bus division, NSB Biltrafikk, the railway company operated both bus and train services between Skoppum and Horten from the mid-1940s.Aspenberg (1994): 142 The new standard gauge was taken into use on 3 October 1949.Jakobsen: 96 With the gauge conversion the number of daily services to eight. Electrification of the Vestfold Line was carried out in 1957, and the Horten Line became the last segment to receive electric traction, on 11 December 1957. NSB gradually increased its focus on bus traffic on the route, reducing the number of train services to five from 1962. NSB decided that it was cheaper to operate all services by bus, and closed down all passenger services on the Horten Line from 26 May 1967. A modest amount of freight traffic was retained. Skoppum Station became unmanned from 1 July 1971, when centralized traffic control was installed. It continued to have a manned ticket sale until 1 January 2001. NSB introduced its \\"InterCity\\" service from 29 May 1978. Most stations on the Vestfold Line were closed, but Skoppum was kept as the key station to serve Horten.Gulowsen: 288 All traffic on the Horten Line terminated in 2002 and the line was demolished in 2009. Facilities The station between 1897 and 1917 Skoppum Station is situated from Oslo Central Station, at an elevation of above mean sea level. The station building is open and has toilets and a ticket machine and vending machines. There are four tracks at the station, although two are closed. In addition to the Horten Line, this is an outer passing loop which is about . The main passing loop is . There are two platforms, with track 1 next to the station and track 2 a side platform. They are long, respectively, with tall platforms. There is about 100 parking spaces and a bicycle rack at the station. Balthazar Lange was selected as the main architect for the Vestfold and Horten Lines, and thus also designed Skoppum, which was designed in Swiss chalet style. To accommodate best possible transfer between the two lines, the station building and auxiliary structures were placed in the central of an island platform, denoted as an island station. The buildings were covered with a adjoined roof, called an umbrella. Although providing excellent transfer conditions, the keilbahnhof-design meant that access to the station had to take place from the southern short end.Hartmann: 147 A second platform and third track serves a passing loop. The unique design has caused the station building, goods shed and umbrella to listed as heritage sites. Hartmann: 148 Service Vy serves Skoppum with line R11, a regional service running between Skien Station through Vestfold to Oslo Central Station and onward on the Gardermoen Line to Eidsvoll Station. Trains run once per hour in each direction, in addition to rush-hour services. Travel time is 1 hour and 10 minutes to Oslo, and 1 hour and 30 minutes to Skien. Vestfold Kollektivtrafikk serves Skoppum with Line 1 which shuttles in to downtown Horten. Travel time is no shorter than 20 minutes. Buses run once or twice per hour. The buses and trains do not correspond in either direction. Future The Vestfold Line is being upgraded to high-speed rail, with the section north of T√∏nsberg scheduled for completion by 2024. The section through Horten is bound by two components. The first is that the line needs to be dimensioned for through speeds of . The second is that two smaller sections of line have already been upgraded. The first is a passing loop at the closed Nykirke Station which opened on 15 October 2001.Bjerke & Holom: 213 The second was of double track from T√∏nsberg Station to the closed Bark√•ker Station, including the Jarlsberg Tunnel, which opened on 7 November 2011. These were both built without a plan for where the line in between would run. With the 2016 opening of the Holmestrand Tunnel, Nykirke‚ÄìBark√•ker and the section through Kobbervikdalen are the only remaining sections needed for a continual high-speed line between Drammen and T√∏nsberg. National Road 19, just south of Skoppum. A potential new Skoppum West Station would be situated somewhat further west than the current line. The conditions made it impossible to place a line through the town of Horten, forcing the Norwegian National Rail Administration to consider three routes which entirely bypassed the town. Three proposals were made. The two easternmost, denoted Bakkenteigen and Skoppum East, would largely be carried on a large viaduct over the landscape. The third, Skuppum West, would run entirely west of the existing track and pass west of the village of Skoppum.Norwegian National Rail Administration: 6 Either way the new station will need a feeder bus service as well as be built with significant park and ride facilities.Norwegian National Rail Administration: 13 The Bakkenteigen alternative would serve the Vestfold campus of the University College of Southeast Norway. Its viaduct would be long. It could also pass through the village of Nykirke. Bakketeigen is regarded as having the best possibility for urban development.Norwegian National Rail Administration: 7 Skoppum East would be shorter, with a slightly shorter viaduct and a slightly longer tunnels.Norwegian National Rail Administration: 8 Skoppum West would avoid viaducts and be only , but have of tunnel. The station would be situated on National Road 19, just off the intersection with E18, west of the village of Skoppum.Norwegian National Rail Administration: 9 The latter has the lowest investment costs,Norwegian National Rail Administration: 10 and the least interference with the landscape.

It is located three miles north west of Haddington, and one mile south of Aberlady. History The castle was built in 1507 when King James IV ordered his private secretary James Murray to build himself a fortified house at Ballencrieff. It was destroyed in or around 1545. From around 1550 to 1580 the house was owned (and presumably rebuilt) by David Borthwick, Lord Lochill who renamed it Lochill Castle. In 1608 the Ballencrieff estate was bought by Sir Bernard Lindsay and then to Sir Patrick Murray in 1632, In 1679 it passed to Sir Peter Wedderburn and in 1755 was bought by George Murray, Lord Elibank, returning it to the Murray family.Archaeologica Scotica Although it is said that General James Murray, a Governor of Canada, was born there in 1721, this would be unlikely as the Murray family did not own it at that time. The house burnt down accidentally in 1868, and stood roofless until it was restored between 1992 and 1997. It is now privately owned, and it is situated next to a free range rare breed pig farm. Ballencrieff Castle from the north The long, rectangular-plan, tower has three storeys, including a vaulted basement, with a near-symmetrical north front. The tall, narrow south-east wing has crow-step gables. The castle, along with its walled garden and pavilion, is a category B listed building. During restoration works, 16th-century gun holes and wooden draw-bars on the windows, were discovered in the ruins.

Management control system influences the behavior of organizational resources to implement organizational strategies. Management control system might be formal or informal.  Overview  Management control systems are tools to aid management for steering an organization toward its strategic objectives and competitive advantage. Management controls are only one of the tools which managers use in implementing desired strategies. However strategies get implemented through management controls, organizational structure, human resources management and culture.Anthony, R. and Govindarajan, V., 2007. Management Control Systems, Chicago, Mc-Graw-Hill IRWIN. According to Simons (1995), Management Control Systems are the formal, information-based routines and procedures managers use to maintain or alter patterns in organizational activities Simons, 1995, Levers of Control, Boston: Harvard Business School Press, p. 5 Anthony & Young (1999) showed management control system as a black box. The term black box is used to describe an operation whose exact nature cannot be observed.  History  One of the first authors to define management control systems was Ernest Anthony Lowe, Professor of Accounting and Financial Management at the University of Sheffield, in his 1972 article \\"On the idea of a management control system.\\" He listed the following four reasons for the need for a planning and control system: :The need for a planning and control system within a business organization flows from certain general characteristics of the nature of business enterprises, the chief of which are follows: :* firstly, the enterprise has (by definition) organizational objectives, as distinct from the separable and individual ones of the members constituting the 'managerial coalition'; :* Secondly, the managers of the sub-units of the enterprise must necessarily be ambivalent in view of their own personal goals, as well as have a good deal of discretion in deciding how they should behave and in formulating their part of any overall plan to achieve organizational objectives; :* thirdly, business situations (and people's behaviour) are full of uncertainty, internally as well as externally to the business enterprise. :* fourthly, there is a necessity to economize, in human endeavours we are invariably concerned with an allocation of effort and resources so as to achieve a given set of objectives...Lowe, Ernest A. \\"On the idea of a management control system: integrating accounting and management control.\\" Journal of management Studies 8.1 (1971): 1-12. The term ‚Äòmanagement control‚Äô was given of its current connotations by Robert N. Anthony (Otley, 1994).Otley, D., 1994. Management control in contemporary organizations: towards a wider framework, Management Accounting Research, 5, 289-299.  Management control system, topics  = Management control = According to Maciariello et al. (1994), management control is concerned with coordination, resource allocation, motivation, and performance measurement. The practice of management control and the design of management control systems draws upon a number of academic disciplines. * Management control involves extensive measurement and it is therefore related to and requires contributions from accounting especially management accounting. * Second, it involves resource allocation decisions and is therefore related to and requires contribution from economics especially managerial economics. * Third, it involves communication, and motivation which means it is related to and must draw contributions from social psychology especially organizational behavior (see Exhibit#1).Maciariello, J. and Kirby, C., 1994. Management Control Systems - Using Adaptive Systems to Attain Control, New Jersey, Prentice Hall. [Anthony and Govindajaran] (2007) defined Management Control as the process by which managers influence other members of the organization to implement the organization‚Äôs strategies. According to Kaplan, management controls are exercised on the basis of information received by the managers. = Management accounting and management accounting system = Anthony & Young (1999) showed that management accounting has three major subdivisions: * full cost accounting, * differential accounting and * management control or responsibility accounting.Anthony, R. and Young, D., 1999. Management control in nonprofit organizations, Boston, Irwin McGraw-Hill. Chenhall (2003) mentioned that the terms management accounting (MA), management accounting systems (MAS), management control systems (MCS), and organizational controls (OC) are sometimes used interchangeably. In this case, management accounting refers to a collection of practices such as budgeting, product costing or incentives. Organizational controls are sometimes used to refer to controls built into activities and processes such as statistical quality control, just- in-time management.Chenhall, R., 2003. Management control system design within its organizational context: Findings from contingency-based research and directions for the future, Accounting, Organizations and Society, 28(2-3), 127-168. = Finance-oriented vs. operational-oriented management control = Traditionally, most measures used in management control systems are accounting-based and financial in nature. This emphasis on financial measures, however, distracts from essential non-financial factors such as customer satisfaction, product quality, etc. Furthermore, non-financial measures are better predictors of long-run performance. Consequently, a management control system should include a comprehensive set of performance aspects consisting of both financial and non-financial metrics. The inclusion of non-financial measures has become an essential characteristic of current management control systems, to the point of becoming the main criterion in distinguishing different systems. Therefore, depending on the balance between financial and non-financial measures, a management control system may be characterized as finance-oriented or operations-oriented. Finance-oriented control systems are primarily based on financial accounting data, such as costs, earnings or profitability, whereas operations-oriented control systems are primarily based on non-financial data that focus on operational output and quality, for example service volume, employee turnover, or customer complaints.  Management control system techniques  According to Horngren et al. (2005), management control system is an integrated technique for collecting and using information to motivate employee behavior and to evaluate performance.Horngren, C., Sundem, G. and Stratton, W., 2005. Introduction to Management Accounting, New Jersey, Pearson.

During weaving, (thick) reinforcement yarns are interwoven at regular intervals in a crosshatch pattern. The intervals are typically 5 to 8 millimeters (0.2 to 0.3 in). Thin and lightweight ripstop fabrics have a 2-dimensional structure due to the thicker yarns being interwoven in thinner cloth. Older lightweight ripstop fabrics display the thicker interlocking thread patterns in the material quite prominently, but more modern weaving techniques make the ripstop threads less obvious. A similar effect can be achieved by weaving two or three fine yarns together at smaller intervals.Fairchild's Dictionary of Textiles, 7th edition, pg. 474 Advantages of ripstop are the favourable strength-to-weight ratio and that small tears can not easily spread. Fibers used to make ripstop include cotton, silk, polyester, and polypropylene, with nylon content limited to the crosshatched threads that make it tear-resistant. Applications Ripstop fabrics are used in yacht sails and spinnakers, hot air balloons, kites, free- flight models, parachutes, and hovercraft skirts. High-quality camping equipment such as lightweight tents, sleeping bags, and camping hammocks tend to use ripstop in order to reduce the wear on their fabrics which are in direct contact with the ground or the wind. Swags, flags, banners, and other applications requiring a strong lightweight fabric use ripstop too. Ripstop reinforcements are incorporated into heavier fabrics requiring extreme durability, such as those used in Army Combat Uniforms, Nomex protective clothing for firefighters and other workwear, Brazilian Jiu Jitsu uniforms, outdoor and sports clothing, backpacks, and luggage bags. Self-adhesive ripstop patches are used to repair both rips and tears in other fabrics. Ripstop used in high-quality camping hammock Ejector seat parachutes made with ripstop are woven with an elastic-like fabric so that they stretch to allow more air to pass through at high speed. Then as the ejector seat slows, the weave closes and acts like a conventional parachute. This allows the pilot seat to slow gently, avoiding compression that could result in spinal injury. Ripstop nylon Ripstop nylon is the primary material used in hot air balloons Ripstop nylon is a light-weight nylon fabric with interwoven ripstop reinforcement threads in a crosshatch pattern. The material comes in many different colors, sizes, and thicknesses. It is woven with coarse, strong warp and filling yarns at intervals so that tears will not spread. Ripstop nylon may be waterproof, water resistant, fire resistant, or have zero porosity (will not allow air or water through), and comes in light, medium and heavy weights. Textures range from a soft and silk-like material to a crisp or stiff fabric that sounds like a paper bag when moved. Nylon was developed in World War II as a replacement for silk in the production of parachutes.

It is served with regional trains operated by Vy. Located close to Sandefjord Airport, Torp, the station is served by a free four-minute shuttle bus service from the station to the airport. The trains operate northwards via towns in Vestfold to Drammen and Oslo and onwards via Oslo Airport, Gardermoen to towns in Hedmark and Oppland. Southwards, the trains serve Sandefjord, Larvik and Grenland. The station opened as Raastad, later R√•stad, in 1881. It had a single building, designed by Balthazar Lange. It was upgraded with a passing loop in 1910, but this was removed in 1971, and the station was closed in 1978. In 2008, the station reopened to serve the airport. The station is owned by the Norwegian National Rail Administration. Service The station consists of a single platform and one track Torp Station's primary function is to serve as an airport rail link for Sandefjord Airport. The station is served by regional trains that operate northwards via towns such as T√∏nsberg, Holmestrand and Drammen to Oslo Central Station and onwards via Oslo Airport to Hamar and Lillehammer, calling at several other smaller stations. Southwards, the trains serve Sandefjord, Larvik, Porsgrunn and Skien. Travel time to Oslo is 1 hour and 48 minutes, and to Oslo Airport it is 2 hours 23 minutes. A shuttle bus at Sandefjord Airport, Torp The station is equipped with a shed, but no other amenities, and also lacks a ticket machine. The platform (but not necessarily the train) is wheelchair accessible. There are about ten parking spaces at the station. A shuttle bus corresponds to all trains during the opening hours of the airport, and a bus trip takes four minutes to the airport terminal. The shuttle bus leaves the airport ten minutes before each train's scheduled departure. The bus is operated by NSB, and is included in the price of the train ticket. There are 42 bus departures each day. The train supplements a coach service, Torp-Ekspressen operated by Unibuss Ekspress, to Oslo, and a local bus service to Sandefjord, operated by Tide Buss for Vestfold Kollektivtrafikk. History The station was originally named Raastad, and opened as part of the Vestfold Line on 7 December 1881. It was located in the former municipality of Sandar, that was also served by J√•stad Station. Raastad was equipped with a wooden station building designed by Balthazar Lange, and cargo expedition. There was initially only one track, but on 1 July 1910, a passing loop was installed at the station, allowing trains to pass. The station was renamed R√•stad in April 1921. In 1969‚Äì70 the passing loop was extended, but already on 15 September 1971 it was disabled, and subsequently removed, with the automation of the signaling. The station became unmanned on 1 October 1971 and was closed on 28 May 1978. The following day, the new \\"InterCity\\" services started on the Vestfold Line. The station area Sandefjord Airport experienced a rapid growth as an airport for low-cost carriers serving Eastern Norway since the late 1990s. Along with the success of the Airport Express Train that connects Oslo with Oslo Airport, Gardermoen, and the decision to provide a shuttle service to the competing Moss Airport, Rygge from Rygge Station, local politicians took initiative to open a dedicated stop for the airport. During the planning of high-speed upgrade of the line, plans called to move the line to create a station integrated in the airport terminal, as had been done with Oslo Airport Station and Trondheim Airport Station. However, as the construction of a new Vestfold Line was put on hold, an intermediate solution was found to reopen R√•stad Station, and offer a shuttle bus to the airport. On 16 May 2007, Vestfold County Municipality announced that they would forward the investment costs of for the new station, with a payback from the National Rail Administration by 2012. The latter would build, own and operate the station. The station opened on 21 January 2008, and the new platform is located on the east side of the tracks. The old station building, location in the west side, has been converted into a museum. During the first year, 80,000 passengers used the station, sufficient to make the NOK 4.5 million used by NSB on the shuttle bus profitable.

Bahu district includes a large area on the eastern side of Bahu Kalat river, between the Iran-Pakistan border to the east, Gwadar Bay to the south and Pishin District to the north. Bahu Kalat is the largest village and centre of Bahu.  Historical features  Bahu had a long history and was a stronghold of sardars in south Baluchistan. Nowadays some aspects of this history can be seen in the form of burnt villages, castles, mosques and wheat storages, but as a result of remoteness and lack of government interests no research has been developed to specify its archaeological characteristics. Dambkou site in Balure-Machi village is one of the most researched ancient archaeological feature of Bahu. This site was first surveyed by major E. Mockler who published his research in 1877 (Mockler 1877:126). About 55 years later, on the basis of his information, Aurel Stein visited the site during his journey to Baluchistan in 1932 and proceeded to make a more detailed and systematic survey. Amongst the numerous graves, he excavated 42 of them, finding many artifacts.  Natural features  The nature of Bahu is among the most distinguished in Iran, and the Bahu Kalat River is at its center. This is the habitat for the Iranian mugger crocodile or (gando)-- a rare species that survives in this and three other nearby river basins in the extreme southeastern area of Iran, above the port of Chabahar. Along the river, this region has fertile land for agricultural purposes, but it is dependent on seasonal rains and vulnerable to drought. Sustained droughts dry up the river completely, and only the moist soil and small pools left by seasonal rains keep the nature alive. In the 1990s, the Iranian government projected a dam in the northern end of Bahu (Pishin) to reserve water for agricultural and human consumption, lands which close to the dam are cultivated with a variety of agricultural products, specially watermelons that are being exported to internal and external markets. Southern end of Bahu district is the Gwatar harbor, which is located in a strategic location, and for several years was under the control of colonialists, especially Portuguese. Nowadays remains of colonial castles are in place. Aquaculture is the main economic potential of south Bahu, in that saltwater shrimp can be cultivated two times in one season.

The most popular one is as follows. Many centuries ago, some local chieftains went to witness the annual festivities at the Koypallikarazhma Bhagavathi temple situated a few kilometers from Chettikulangara. The visitors were humiliated and ridiculed by the Koypallikarazhma temple authorities and the village chieftains there. Perturbed by the humiliation, and out of retribution, they decided to construct a Bhagavathi temple at Chettikulangara. People of Chettikulangara united for this cause, and headed by the Karanavars (Family Heads) of the four to five then leading families of the region decided to seek the blessings of Kodungallur Bhagavathi in this mission. They embarked on a pilgrimage visiting various temples en route and reached Kodungallur, and performed Bhajanam for 12 days to please the Goddess. It is said that the Devi came in their dreams to say that she would soon come to Chettikulangara. The next day, they happily returned to Chettikulangara with a sacred sword given by the Velichappadu of Kodungallur temple, and started civil works of the temple. A few days later, while the kadathukaran (local boatman) of the nearby Karippuzha rivulet was winding up his work on a late evening, he heard an old woman requesting his help to ferry her to the other shore. He felt it was his duty to help this lonely lady, and decided to accompany her to Chettikulangara, the destination she was said to be heading for. On the way, they took rest beneath a wayside tree (the place now houses the Puthusseriambalam temple), and the Kadathukaran brought food for them from a nearby [mannan/washer man] house. Soon he fell asleep, and when he woke up by early daybreak, the lady had vanished. (It is said that this boatman was a Christian, and for helping Devi to ferry across the Karippuzha thodu, the descendants of his family were entrusted with the job of Vedi (ritual fireworks at the temple). He elaborated about this mysterious incident to the people of Chettikulangara, and they felt the Devi had reached Chettikulangara. The next day, annual maintenance works on thatched roof was going on at the illam (the traditional house where a community of Brahmins in central Kerala reside) adjacent to the present temple. While the Antharjanam of the house was serving the dish of Kanji (rice porridge) muthirapuzhukku (a local special dish with ingredients of baked Horse Gram cereal and kneaded coconut) and Asthram (another side dish, a paste of different locally procured vegetables) for the workers, a strange old woman joined them for lunch. Soon after the food, the old lady moved to the western side of the house, and vanished in thin air with a bright glow. Antharjanam witnessed this, and she fell unconscious. Later she elaborated her experience to the people. The same day, Devi showed her presence to the village chieftains. They approached famous astrologers, it was confirmed that the Bhagavathi had reached Chettikulangara. According to one version, this temple was consecrated by Padmapadacharyar (a leading disciple of Adi Shankara) on the Uthrittathi (Uttara Bhadrapada) day of Makara month in A.D. 823. There is a firm argument that the goddess here was a family deity, and later emerged as the village and regional deity. Local historians oppose the argument that the temple is not as ancient as the nearby Kandiyoor Mahadeva temple or Mavelikara Krishna Swamy temple as it had not been mentioned in Unnuneeli Sandesam written in the 14th century. According to late Kandiyoor Mahadeva Shasthri, Samudra Bandhan‚Äìa leading courtier of Ravi Varman, an ancient King of Venad had visited this temple and wrote poems on Bhagavathi. Similarly, they argue that Aadithya Kulasekharan, the King of Venad (1374 A.D. to 1389 A.D.) also visited the Chettkulangara temple. In addition, one argument favours the notion that this Devi temple was an old kavu where Kadmattath Achan Nambuthiri, on his way to nearby panayanarkavu at parumala from Thevalakara, tried to control a Yakshi (demon) and found no place to give her a stay. He came and prayed to the God and was able to control her. (she's still there in the temple compound). However, it is to be said that the present Sreekovil of the temple is only 450‚Äì480 years old, and the Chuttambalam is not more than two centuries old. Local historians say that the temple infrastructure and the surroundings were developed by various local chieftains from time to time. The present Sreekoil was revamped during A.D.1540. Because of a small fire at this temple, the Chuttambalam was slightly modified during the Malayalam year 1002. It is also believed that Chettikulangara Amma (the main deity) is the daughter of Kodungallur Amma, brought to that place for the well being of all people at Onattukara (Mavelikara). And it also says that some Chettyar families from Tamil Nadu was related to the name Chettikulangara. Sub-deities There are many Upadevathas (sub-deities) adjacent to the temple, and a few Prathishtas were either revamped or added according to the Deva Prashnam by expert astrologers recently. The main Upadevathas in the temple premises are * Yakshini * Ganapathi * Nagarajav * Balakan * Muhurthi * Naga Yakshi * Thevara Moorthy * Kannamballi bhagavathi * Rekshas (a fierce supernatural creature who feeds on humans) * Vallyachan (Central Travancore parlance for family chieftains; they are worshiped by his descendants after death) There is a small temple for Moolasthanam (primary abode). A Kavu (a patch of small forest which houses the serpent Gods, and is common in central Travancore). A Karimbana and Chembakam tree on the premises are places of worship on the belief that they house Gandharvas and Yakshis, the supernatural elements who accompany Bhagavathy, their master, during her trips, termed Varuthu Pokku in local parlance. As followed for many centuries, elephants are not taken to the western side of the Nalambalam, fearing that the fairy creatures residing at the Chembakam may kill them. Festivals The Temple has a number of festivals. The important ones are =Parayeduppu= In the numerous temples of Onattukara, the \\"Parayeduppu\\" period is the festival season. It all begins when the deity (\\"Devi\\") of Chettikulangara temple is taken out in procession for Parayeduppu on the Makayriam star of the Malayalam month Makaram. The festivals continue to the end of Meenam. The main part of Parayeduppu is the Jeevatha constructed in the model of the temple structure itself. This box- like carriage for the deity rests on two teakwood poles about two meters long, and is in the form of a palanquin . The front resembles \\"Thidambu\\" behind which is a kind of pettakam (small chest) built as per Thachusaasthra calculations. Up front is a woollen cloth embroidered with shining, colourful pictures and gold trinkets. Behind that is kept the deity's holy dress, starched and pleated, and decorated with small mirror pieces. More than 100 families form the entourage of Parayeduppu Bhagavathy's - three-month-long visit to the homes of people who lives in her Karas The rhythms used during Jeevatha Ezunnallathu (procession) are quite noteworthy. Starting with very slow beats, it builds up a crescendo and ends in fast beats. The ensemble consists of Veekkan chenda, Uruttu chenda (both drums), Elathaalam (cymbals). Although Jeevatha Ezunnallathu and Parayeduppu are centuries old customs, the \\"Chuvadu Vechu Kali\\" (a peculiar dance with unique steps) is recent. =Kumbha Bharani= The major festival at Chettikulangara is Kumbha Bharani. This is in the month of February or March. The date is determined according to the Malayalam Calendar KollaVarsham. The Chettikulangara Bharani is celebrated in the month of Kumbha and on the day which has the star Bharani and hence the name Kumbha Bharani. The highlight of the festival is Kuthiyottam and Kettukazhcha. The preparation for Kumbha Bharani starts 7(seven) days before the actual day and usually that day will be the Shivarathi. People who had pledged for Kuthiyottam will start training their children for the offering on Shivarathi day. All these days these people will host public get-togethers and arrange food for them. The children will be taught a special dance steps called Kuthiyota chuvadukal. Meanwhile, the people from 13 karas of chettikulangara will arrange for the construction of their Kettukazhcha to the temple. The Kuthiyottam processions starts early morning on that day and will last until afternoon. Those who had offered Kuthiyottam to Devi will bring their children to the temple as a procession and will offer the children before Devi as sacrifice. The boys will be playing the Kuthiyootam dance before the Devi. During the evening hours it will be turn of the Kettukazhcha. People from each area will pull the Kettukazhcha from the construction sites (usually in their respective karas itself) to the temple to present them before the Devi and after having darshan the parties take up their respective position in the paddy fields lying east of the temple During the night, the image of Devi will be carried in procession to the Kettukazhcha stationed in the paddy fields. On the next day these structures will be taken back. A big bazaar known as Bharani Chanda is also held at Chetikulangara as part of this festival. =Ethirelpu Ulsavam= This is the annual temple festival. On the tenth day following the Kumbha Bharani the annual festival is celebrated in the temple for 13 days. Each day of the festival is organized by residents of each Kara numbering 13. special rituals are held in the temple premises. Every afternoon, cultural processions start form each Kara to the temple premises, with the accompaniment of drums, ornamented umbrellas, kuthiyottam songs, display of events from the Mahabharatha and the Ramayana, classical art forms, folk art form, different type of music, decorated structures and caparisoned elephants. During the rituals at the temple Thottampattu is sung. Thottampattu is a devotional song sung by a certain section of the community residing in the far off Trivandrum. This song is sung in the temple only during the Etheralpu festival. Performance of classical arts and other temple arts are conducted in the evening in the temple premises =Aswathy Ulsavam= The unique rituals during the Aswathy festival clearly convey the firm bondage and human pathos at the time of separation between the people and their beloved Bhagavathy. Held in the Aswathy day in the month of Meenom, this festival is attracting a large number of visitors. This festival is imagined as a send off to the deity on her journey to visit her mother at Kodungallur. In the evening, 100 odd decorated [Kettukazhcha] and different effigies are brought to the temple mainly made by the children. Though the size of these Kettukazhcha are comparatively smaller than the ones made for Bharani festival, the number of Kettukazhcha provide a visual impact even challenging the aesthetic effect of Bharani. During the day, Bhagavathy visits the four karas surrounding the temple for Parayeduppu and official Anpolis are given by Kara leaders at Kuthirachevudu, the place where Kuthiras are made. After that she visits and blesses the offerings displayed at the temple premises. By dawn, she decides to leave, and seeks their permission to leave for Kodungallur. The people of the first four karas make Polavilakku (a large structure drawn on wheels decorated with tender banana stem and lighted with numerous traditional lamps) during her farewell procession. They offer her a grand farewell procession with Aappindi [a unique slow-paced dance carrying a pyramid shape box on head). Aappindi will be embellished with crackers, pookkula (cluster of coconut flowers - inflorescence), and will be covered with tender banana stems and Thalapppoli (traditional sacred lamps carried by ladies). People from Kaitha North and Kaitha South participate in the function with Thiruvantham. It is said that Thiruvantham, a palanquin type structure with fireballs and carried by four people, is the light of Darika, which incenses the Bhagavathy. She scares them away. After the procession, she again visits the Upaprathishtas and asks the people and other gods to let her visit her mother at Kodungallur. By dawn, she proceeds with lightning sped towards west. Normally, within the 100 meters, the Poojaris carrying the Jeevatha will fall down unconsciously, and the Jeevatha will be taken back to the temple. The temple will remain closed for the day, and will be opened only the day after. The Aswathy festival concludes the five-month-long festivities at this temple. Kettukazhcha 2017 Chettikulangara Kettukazcha panorama Kettukazhcha kuthira Theru Kettukazhcha is an offering of the people of Chettikulangara to their beloved deity known for her spontaneous blessings on true devotees as a mark of gratitude, devotion, unflinching faith, and for showering prosperity and protection to their lives. Kettukazhcha displays deftly sculpted and decorated forms of six temple cars known as ‚ÄòKuthira‚Äô (Horses), five Theru‚Äô (Chariots ) and icons of Bhima and Hanuman. All the temple cars, chariots and the icons are all incredibly gigantic in size and are many times larger than any other similar Kuthiras and Therus built during the festivities at other temples in the Central Travancore region. On the move, these out of the world sky scrapping colourful decorations are electrifying, and will create an unforgettable artistic impression in union, especially during the night in the back drop of illuminated lights. Chettikulangara Kettukazhcha heralds the architectural and aesthetic acumen of the ancient people of Chettikulangara, who could convert an improbable out of the world concept to an enormous artistic reality, achieved by collective hardships and will power. Lineage according to historians Historians attribute the concept of ‚ÄòKettukazhchas‚Äô - similar to the architecture of the Buddha tradition in square, rectangular and pyramid shapes, to the remnants of the Buddha culture which was widely prevalent in the Central Travancore region a few centuries ago. Many historians cite that the famous Chettikulangara Kettukazhcha in the present form is not more than 180 to 200 years old, and was started during the early part of the 19th century. According to a popular legend, a group of village chieftains and their workers went for civil works to construct the Kollam‚ÄìChavara Thodu (canal), about 50 km away from Chettikulangara, in accordance to the decision from the then ruler of the region. But they could not return to their native place due to the unforeseen inordinate delay in completion of the canal. They pleaded with the authorities, but their request was turned down. During the period, they got an opportunity to visit the temple festivities at Kollam Mulankagakam temple, and were attracted by the Kettukazhcha there. They vowed to their local deity Chettikulangara Bhagavathy, that they would construct Kettukazhchas for her every year, if they were allowed to leave for Chettkulangara immediately. To their surprise, they were allowed to return to Chettikulangara the very next day, and as promised, they made huge Kettukazhchas and took them to their Bhagavathy's premises. Kuthiras Kuthiras have a height of about 70 to 105 feet, and are a union of four parts‚Äì Adikkoottu, Kathirakal, Edakkodaram, Prabhada and Melkkoodaram, one above the other respectively. Adikkottu the basic structure also known as Vandikkoottu, form the basic foundation which consists of four big wooden wheels interconnected with four other beams above it. Kuthiras have Thandu, two long huge wooden poles helpful to control the direction while on the move. Thandu and the basic structure are interconnected and have reinforced wooden bearings similar to the modern shock absorbers. Kathirukal with about 35 feet height, consists of four long poles interconnected with Arecanut poles known as ‚ÄòAlaku‚Äô and reinforced with coir and Panavalli knots. These are again strengthened with ‚ÄòKuthukathrika‚Äô or criss cross formation of Alakus. Kathirakal is again bifurcated to two parts‚Äìthe lower portion consisting of four to five extended layers of Thattu and Charippu (slanting pyramid shaped boxes, made of interconnected Alakus and coir formation, then decorated with white cloth known as Vella, colourful glittering clothes and embellishments called ‚ÄòThookku‚Äô. Prabhada consists of exquisite wooden carved sculptors narrating stories from the Puranas, elephant caparisons called Nettipattoms, Thalekkettu and Aalavattom displayed in the backdrop of colourful clothes and sculptors. Many of the Prabhadas have stories like Gajendramoksham, Vasthrapaharanam, Krishnavatharm. Edakkoodaram almost half the size of Kathirakal with four to five Charippu made as in the lower portion, comes above the Kathirakal. It also has glittering different clothes and Vella, interlaced with colourful Thookku embellishments. Melkkoodaramthe top structure is exactly having a pyramid shape, and pivotal to it is an extended long sculpted wooden pole in white colour known as ‚ÄòNambu‚Äô. All the separate units are pulled up and placed one above the other with the help of wooden pulleys, giant coir ropes called Vadams with a length of over 100 fts.and with huge iron structures, drawn by hundreds of people. Theru Theru does not have the Prabhadas and Edakkoodarams. Their Illithattu and Charippu are larger than that of the Kuthiras and diminishes in size upwards. Therus are also smaller than the Kuthiras height. Bhima and Hanuman The wooden icons of Bhima made by Mattom North and Hanuman brought by Mattom south are probably the largest of its kind in the world, and are sure to be the largest in Kerala. Bhima's icon is postured as the Pandava en route to kill Baka on Pothu Vandi (vehicle drawn by buffalos) with food for the Rakshasa King. Mattom south kara also brings the icon of Panjali along with Hanuman Preparations for constructing the Kettukazhchas start from Shivarathri, about six to ten days prior to Kumbhabharani. On the evening of Kumbhabharani, the Kettukazhchas are dragged to the temple by hundreds of people, and are paraded at the paddy field in front of the temple. After Bhagavathi's Ezhunnellippu to bless the Kettukazhchas and people, the Kettukazhchas are taken back to the respective Karas by next morning. The dismantled parts of Kettukazhchas are kept at the 'Kuthirappura' of each Karas. Kuthiyottam Kuthiyottam is performed as an important offering to the deity. This is a ritual dance practiced and perfected through several centuries. It used to be done only in houses in the 13 Karas of the Chettikulangara Temple but after a recent Deva Prashnam it was allowed to conduct Kuthiyottam in the houses outside of the 13 Karas . The houses are decorated, and the portrait of the deity is installed in temporary structures. Kuthiyottam starts a week before Bharani day. It is a type of folk dance performed by youths with the accompaniment of folk music and other musical instruments. Young boys between 8 and 14 years are taught this ritual dance in the house amidst a big social gathering before the portrait of the deity. Feasts are also provided for all the people. Early in the morning on Bharani, after the feast and other rituals, the boys whose bodies are coiled with silver wires, one end of which is tied around his neck and an arecanut fixed on the tip of a knife held high over his head are taken in procession to the temple with the accompaniment of beating of drums, music, ornamental umbrellas, and other classical folk art forms, and richly caparisoned elephants. All through the way to the temple tender coconut water will be continually poured on his body. After the circumambulation the boys stands at a position facing the Sreekovil (Sanctum Sanctorum) and begins to dance. This ceremony ends with dragging the coil pierced to the skin whereby a few drop of blood comes out.

He, along with his father Newman Clanton and brother Ike Clanton, worked a ranch near the boomtown of Tombstone, Arizona Territory and stole livestock from Mexico and later U.S. ranchers. He was a member of group of loosely organized outlaws who had ongoing conflicts with lawmen Wyatt, Virgil, and Morgan Earp. The Clantons repeatedly threatened the Earps because they interfered with the Cowboys' illegal activities. On October 26, 1881, Billy, Tom McLaury, and Frank McLaury were killed in the Gunfight at the O.K. Corral in the town of Tombstone. His brother Ike was unarmed and ran from the gunfight. The shootout was his only gunfight. Ike filed murder charges against the Earps, who were later exonerated as having acted within their duty as lawmen. Early life Clanton was born in Hamilton County, Texas, one of seven children of Newman Haynes Clanton and his wife Mariah Sexton (Kelso) Clanton: John Wesley, Joseph Issac, Phineas Fay, Alonzo Peter, Mary Elise and Ester Ann. His father worked at times as a day laborer, a gold miner, a farmer, and by the late 1870s, a cattleman in Arizona Territory. 1851 Newman Clanton moves his family to Adams County, Illinois. The family moved to California after the end of the Civil War. Clanton's mother died in 1866. Move to Arizona Clanton moved with his family in 1873 to Pima County, Arizona Territory and then to Charleston. His father started the \\"Clanton Ranch\\" in 1877. In the same year prospector Ed Schieffelin discovered silver in the hills east of the San Pedro River on a plateau known as Goose Flats, less than from the Clanton ranch. The boom town of Tombstone grew within two years from less than 100 to more than 7,000 residents. Billy Clanton and his brother Ike often went into Tombstone on weekends, and he did business in Tombstone associated with the ranch, alongside the two McLaury brothers. By most accounts, Ike was not well liked in and around Tombstone because he was a drunk and a braggart. Clanton was generally well liked and looked upon as hard working and level headed. Livestock thefts A few days after Wyatt Earp's arrival in Tombstone in December 1879, one of his prized horses was stolen. He heard several times that the Clantons had his horse. Almost a year later he got a tip that it had been seen at the Clanton's ranch near Charleston. Earp rode to their ranch and saw the horse being ridden down the street and placed in a corral. He stabled his horse at another corral and telegraphed James Earp in Tombstone to send up ownership papers for the horse to Charleston. Warren Earp brought the papers out that night. Earp testified in a later court hearing, \\"While I was waiting for the papers, Billy Clanton found out that I was in town and went and tried to take the horse out of the corral. I told him that he could not take him out, that it was my horse. After the papers came, he gave the horse up without the papers being served, and asked me if I had any more horses to lose.\\" In July 1879, several rustlers attacked a rancho in northern Sonora, Mexico, killing several of the inhabitants. Hunting the murderers, Mexican Rurales led by Commandant Francisco Neri illegally crossed the border into Arizona and were ambushed. Johnny Ringo later said that Old Man Clanton and his sons Ike and Billy were among the murderers. On August 13, 1881, Billy's father was killed in an ambush Guadalupe Canyon by Mexican Rurales. The Clanton sons continued operating the ranch. On October 25, 1881, Ike, Billy, and the McLaury brothers headed to Tombstone after working to gather scattered cattle, lost during an earlier Apache raid. The events that transpired over that night and the next day have various versions. Shooting in Tombstone The bodies of Tom and Frank McLaury and Billy Clanton on display on a sidewalk in Tombstone. Graves of Billy Clanton, Frank McLaury and Tom McLaury in Boothill Cemetery, Tombstone, Arizona. Ike had repeated confrontations with the Earps and Doc Holliday. On October 26, 1881, events came to a head when Billy and Ike got together with Billy Claiborne and brothers Tom and Frank McLaury at the Dexter Corral. When they were seen in town \\"heeled\\" (armed), anxious citizens warned the Earps. Upon attempting to disarm the Cowboys, a shootout broke out, later named the Gunfight at the O.K. Corral. There remain today conflicting versions of what actually happened and who fired first. Ike Clanton and Billy Claiborne ran away in the opening moments. Billy Clanton emptied his gun during the fight and was killed along with both McLaurys. Doc Holliday, Virgil and Morgan Earp were wounded in the shootout. The town was divided, with many supporting the Clantons, and others supporting the Earps. The funeral that followed was the largest in Tombstone's history, with more than 300 people following the hearse and 2,000 watching from the city's sidewalks. The three Cowboys were buried in the Boot Hill cemetery. William McLaury, Frank and Tom's brother, tried to indict the Earps for killing the Cowboys. He wrote in a letter during the preliminary hearing that the two brothers and Billy Clanton were preparing to come to Fort Worth, Texas to visit after selling their cattle. In popular culture On screen Billy has been portrayed by James Ferrara in Tombstone, the Town Too Tough to Die (1942), John Ireland in My Darling Clementine (1946), Dennis Hopper in Gunfight at the O.K. Corral (1957), Ralph Reed and Gary Gray in The Life and Legend of Wyatt Earp (1957-1960), David Cole in the Doctor Who episode The Gunfighters (1966), Bruce M.

Necessity goods are products and services that consumers will buy regardless of the changes in their income levels, therefore making these products less sensitive to income change. Examples include repetitive purchases of different durations such as haircuts, habits including tobacco, everday essentials such as electricity and water, and critical medicine such as insulin. As for any other normal good, an income rise will lead to a rise in demand, but the increase for a necessity good is less than proportional to the rise in income, so the proportion of expenditure on these goods falls as income rises. If income elasticity of demand is lower than unity, it is a necessity good. This observation for food, known as Engel's law, states that as income rises, the proportion of income spent on food falls, even if absolute expenditure on food rises. This makes the income elasticity of demand for food between zero and one. Some necessity goods are produced by a public utility. According to Investopedia, stocks of private companies producing necessity goods are known as defensive stocks. Defensive stocks are stocks that provide a constant dividend and stable earnings regardless of the state of the overall stock market.

He was the first Cambodian native bishop.  Life  Salas was born in Phnom Penh on 21 October 1937. For his formation as a priest, he was sent to Paris and was ordained in 1964. His first assignment was in the Apostolic Prefecture of Battambang. He returned to France for more studies. In April 1975, the Khmer Rouge took power in Cambodia. They founded a Communist state with the name of Democratic Kampuchea, where any religion was forbidden and destruction of religious sites was contemplated. In May 1975, any foreigner in Cambodia was expelled and it included Catholic priests and religious, while natives were forced to work in rice fields and many of them were executed. French Bishop Yves Ramousse was at the head of the Cambodian Church when the Khmer Rouge took power. As the prevision was his expulsion from the country for being a foreigner, he called Salas back to Cambodia. On April 14, 1975, the Holy See appointed Salas as Coadjutor Bishop for the Apostolic Vicariate of Phnom Penh. On April 30, Bishop Ramousse was expelled from the country with many other foreign priests and religious. Most Cambodian priests and religious remained in the country, very few would survive. In 1976, Bishop Ramousse resigned as head of the Cambodian Church. Salas became the head, but he was sent by the Khmer Rouge Regime to a rice field in Kompong Thom.

The film stars Harry Connick, Jr. as Dr. Dennis Slamon, a doctor who is trying to find a cure for breast cancer. The film also stars Paula Cale, Angie Harmon and Amanda Bynes in supporting roles. Plot The film follows the true story of Dr. Dennis Slamon (played by Harry Connick, Jr.), who helped develop the breast cancer drug Herceptin, over the course of 8 years from 1988 to 1996. Dr. Slamon is a research doctor at UCLA Medical Center (Los Angeles), where he has developed the experimental drug Herceptin, which he believes will become a treatment for breast cancer. However, when the drug company stops funding for research, philanthropists, including Lilly Tartikoff (Angie Harmon) and Ronald Perelman help him continue tests of the drug. Funding was done with an initial donation from Perelman's Revlon charity, and continued over the years with the \\"Fire and Ice Ball\\" organized by Tartikoff. Eventually the drug company funds the research and the drug goes through three trials before gaining approval from the FDA (Food and Drug Administration). Prior to the trials, the drug has a \\"mouse trial\\", with Nicole (Tammy Blanchard), a young mother with stage 4 cancer, receiving the drug first. Although her mother Elizabeth (Swoosie Kurtz) pleads with Dr. Slamon, Nicole is not included in the subsequent trials as she does not meet the protocols. The women in the trials, particularly the first trial, band together. They handle their disease and drug trial, with humor‚ÄîTish (Jennifer Coolidge), or with alternative therapy‚ÄîTina (Trudie Styler). The stories of Barbara (Bernadette Peters) and Ellie (Regina King) are followed throughout, as they go through the trials and eventual recovery. Some patients involved in the tests die, but ultimately Slamon's work with the drug changes the course of breast cancer treatment.

History =Foundation= Th·ª•c Ph√°n was the first and only monarch of √Çu L·∫°c and used the royal title of An D∆∞∆°ng V∆∞∆°ng. He created the Th·ª•c dynasty by uniting the mountainous √Çu Vi·ªát region (comprising what is today northernmost Vietnam and parts of southern China) with the more southerly L·∫°c Vi·ªát (located in the Red River Delta of what is today northern Vietnam). According to old Vietnamese historical records ƒê·∫°i Vi·ªát s·ª≠ k√Ω to√†n th∆∞ and Kh√¢m ƒë·ªãnh Vi·ªát s·ª≠ Th√¥ng gi√°m c∆∞∆°ng m·ª•c, An D∆∞∆°ng V∆∞∆°ng (Th·ª•c Ph√°n) was a son of Prince Th·ª•c Ch·∫ø of the Kaiming dynasty of state of Shu, pronounced Th·ª•c in Vietnamese.) Ch·∫ø was a descendant of L√¥ T·ª≠ B√° V∆∞∆°ng, who was the last ruler of Shu.Taylor (1983), p. 19Asian Perspectives, Volume 28, Issue 1 (1990), p. 36 When Ch·∫ø was a little kid, his relatives brought him and sought refuge in the southern Chinese provinces of Guangxi and Yunnan and then moved their people to modern- day northern Vietnam after the destruction of Shu state, in 316 BCE, by King Huiwen of Qin from the neighbouring Qin state. Twenty-five years later, Ch·∫ø married a native woman and had a child named Ph√°n, who became a well known warrior. After assembling an army, he defeated King H√πng V∆∞∆°ng XVIII, the last ruler of the H·ªìng B√†ng dynasty, in around 258 BC. Then, he proclaimed himself An D∆∞∆°ng V∆∞∆°ng (\\"King An D∆∞∆°ng\\"). After a successful resistance against an invasion by King Huiwen's descendant Qin Shi Huang, he annexed the kingdom of VƒÉn Lang, which was in the Red River Delta. Some modern Vietnamese believe that Th·ª•c Ph√°n came upon the √Çu Vi·ªát territory (modern-day northernmost Vietnam, western Guangdong, and southern Guangxi, with its capital in what is today Cao B·∫±ng Province.) He then renamed VƒÉn Lang as √Çu L·∫°c, combining the names of the conquering and conquered peoples, and established a new fortress and capital at Co Loa on a rise overlooking the Red River about northeast of central Hanoi. An D∆∞∆°ng V∆∞∆°ng still kept the VƒÉn Lang's state model, but he reformed and centralized the state with the king holding more power. He encouraged the development of blacksmiths and merchants, established towns and cities, which replaced the tribal society of previous VƒÉn Lang. √Çu L·∫°c encouraged trading with Chinese, Javanese, and Indians. =Downfall= Around 180 to 179 BC, √Çu L·∫°c was conquered by Nam Vi·ªát, a kingdom that had its capital city, Panyu, around modern Guangzhou. Nam Vi·ªát rule lasted until 111 BC. In Vietnamese history, the rule of the Nam Vi·ªát kings is referred to as the Tri·ªáu dynasty.

Biography Marcella Puppini started playing the piano at age five and hoped to become an opera singer. At the age of 18, having completed her A levels in Classics (Ancient Greek, Latin, Italian Literature and Art History), Puppini moved to London to study at Central Saint Martins College of Art and Design. Having graduated in fashion, Puppini became Accessories Production Manager at Vivienne Westwood Studios but kept her side career as a singer in clubs all around London. In 1999, she left the fashion world and embarked on a degree course at Trinity College of Music, where she graduated in Jazz Performance and Composition. Her first band was called Dead Sex Kitten. She appeared on Rich B's song \\"Revolution\\". She also performed in her own name in the jazz and cabaret scene in the UK and Italy. In 2004, Puppini created a new group called the Puppini Sisters, a close-harmony trio inspired by the sister groups of the 1930s and '40s. The Puppini Sisters' debut album, Betcha Bottom Dollar (UCJ, 2006), was awarded a Gold disc in the UK. Puppini became involved in alternative performance art. She worked with Marisa Carnesky on Ghost Train, with Paloma Faith in 2005, with The Whoopee Club as musical director, and with Duckie. She founded Marcella and The Forget Me Nots. The band's first album came out in January 2010 as part of Twisted Cabaret, a part-audio, part-video compilation curated by French label Volvox. Marcella and The Forget Me Nots changed formation in 2010 to become an indie-art-punk-Weimar inspired band and released Born Beautiful in 2011. Puppini has been working as a regular guest conductor for the Georgy Garanian Big Band, formerly known as the Russian State Big Band. She has performed in Moscow, Siberia, and in Izhevsk as part of a Tchaikovsky festival. In May 2013, she was nominated as the Mayoress of Camden.

The village is approximately a mile and a half from the market town of Saffron Walden, south from Cambridge, the nearest city, and northeast from the county town and city of Chelmsford. The parish of Littlebury includes the village of Littlebury Green and the hamlets of Catmere End and Chapel Green at the west, and parts of the estate of Audley End at the southeast. The parish had a population of 869 at the 2011 census. History The area has been inhabited since prehistoric times, with Bronze Age tools having been found at Little Chesterford and Iron Age sherds to the east of the village. Ring Hill Fort to the west of Audley End is believed to date from the Iron Age, and there is significant evidence of Roman settlement. The name Littlebury first appears in a 10th-century will as lytlan byrig and in 1008 as Lithanberi. The village is located on the medieval London to Newmarket road (now the B1383 and A11) as well as the River Cam. A Roman road crossed the parish at Littlebury Green, which is referred to as Streetly Green in some historic records. The parish was owned by Ely Abbey from the ninth century, and was retained by the Crown following Dissolution. In 1601 it was sold to Thomas Sutton and in 1603 fell to the Earl of Suffolk. It passed between the Earls of Suffolk, owners of Audley End house, until in 1762 it was bequeathed to Lord Braybrooke. The Cambridge to Liverpool Street line passes through the village and it formerly had its own station. Church Holy Trinity church, Littlebury The parish church of Holy Trinity was built on the site of a Roman camp. The first record of it dates from 1163 and the church was considerably altered between 1870 and 1874. It houses a beautiful stone font with decorated oak canopy. St Peter's church at Littlebury Green was built in 1885. The village formerly supported a chapel, situated on Chapel Green, but no trace of it remains. Governance An electoral ward in the same name exists. This ward stretches south to Arkesden with a total population at the 2011 census of 1,708. Amenities The village has a pub, the Queen's Head, a fourteenth- century coaching inn. Notable people The architect Henry Winstanley (1644-1703) was a resident of Littlebury. He was clerk of the King's works at Newmarket and Audley End under Charles II and built the first Eddystone lighthouse. Other residents include Thomas Sutton, Master of the Ordnance in the North, and Joan Bradbury, widow of Thomas Bradbury who founded a school in the 17th century.

This is commemorated by a plaque within Shieldfield Green, and reflected in the naming of King Charles Tower adjacent to the site. The area was increasingly urbanised during the 19th Century and by 1881 contained many houses for the employees of nearby factories. The population at this time was 12,826, living in 2,253 units of accommodation (mostly flats). There were also 16 pubs and 19 'beer shops' which permitted patrons to drink on the premises.

The record was produced and compiled by the filmmakers Dietmar Post and Lucia Palacios. It was released in October 2006. The official record release was part of a major event at Berliner Volksb√ºhne, (Germany). Play Loud! Productions not only premiered Monks: The Transatlantic Feedback but also invited renowned guest musicians to join The Monks on stage to what would be their first German live show after almost 40 years. The following guest musicians from Silver Monk Time took part: Mark E. Smith (The Fall), The Raincoats, Peter Hein (Fehlfarben) and Schorsch Kamerun (Goldene Zitronen). Styles, concepts and reviews The film Monks: The Transatlantic Feedback throughout its entire production process continuously encountered financial problems. Many people within the media thought of the Monks music as something not relevant. The creation of Silver Monk Time meant both a new financing concept for the film and a sort of musical experiment and/or maybe even demonstration. The title Silver Monk Time came about due to a rumor that after the release of Black Monk Time in May 1966 The Monks already had initiated work on what was supposed to be their second LP. One beat accompanied by one continuous feedback was supposed to have spread out on two LP sides that would be known by the title Silver Monk Time. For the new Silver Monk Time it was decided no to do a standard tribute record by just having the original songs covered. The participating 29 bands were explicitly asked to experiment with the Monks concept. Famous German electronic avant-garde band Mouse on Mars wrote in the detailed booklet to the record: \\"Mouse on Mars have tried to prove that after the deconstruction of the Monks their undeniable influence on 21st-century pop music has been proven. Rhythm, sound and melody grow together to a stream of lava on which the energy laden music surfs down into the valley of Dionysus by tearing down mirror balls like apples from trees.\\" The Neue Z√ºrcher Zeitung writes: ‚ÄûK√ºnstlerisch √§hnlich kreativ und unerschrocken wie die Monks stehen ihre Enkel f√ºr eine Form von Popmusik, in der es √§sthetisch und musikalisch Gewagtes zu entdecken gilt, in der einmal das Unvers√∂hnliche vor dem Selbstzufriedenen den Ton angibt‚Äú.3sat-Pressespiegel The Village Voice is convinced that: \\"The Uberbeat (and a war or two) goes on. (...) Silver Monk Time buys us all some more hop time, finally!‚Äú The Wire mentioned Silver Monk Time among the best compilation records of the year 2007: \\"Unlike many tribute projects that fall flat due to those involved being either overawed or ignorant of the original material, Silver Monk Time succeeds because the participants have taken the group's primitive rock surge as a template to experiment with. As a result the sound of The Monks is treated to a 21st century workout with synthesizers and beat tracks threaded through the original quartet's already way out psychotic minimalism‚Äú.

When activated, this mode suspends the device's radio-frequency (RF) signal transmission technologies (i.e., Bluetooth, telephony and Wi-Fi), effectively disabling all voice, text and phone services. GPS may or may not be disabled, because it does not involve transmitting radio waves. The mode is so named because most airlines prohibit the use of equipment that transmit RF signals while in flight. Typically it is not possible to make phone calls or send messages in airplane mode, but some smartphones allow calls to emergency services. Most devices allow continued use of email clients and other mobile apps to write text or email messages. Messages are stored in memory to transmit later, once airplane mode is disabled. Wi-Fi and Bluetooth can be enabled separately while the device is in airplane mode, as allowed by the operator of the aircraft. Receiving RF signals (as by radio receivers and satellite navigation services) is not inhibited by airplane mode; however, both transmitters and receivers are needed to receive calls and messages, even when not responding to them.

It is an instance of the xUnit architecture for unit testing frameworks that originated with SUnit and became popular with JUnit. PHPUnit was created by Sebastian Bergmann and its development is hosted on GitHub. Purpose PHPUnit is based on the idea that developers should be able to find mistakes in their newly committed code quickly and assert that no code regression has occurred in other parts of the code base. Much like other unit testing frameworks, PHPUnit uses assertions to verify that the behavior of the specific component - or \\"unit\\" - being tested behaves as expected.Assertion (computing) Benefits The goal of unit testing is to isolate each part of the program and show that the individual parts are correct. A unit test provides a strict, written contract that the piece of code must satisfy. As a result, unit tests find problems early in the development cycle. PHPUnit can output test results in a number of different formats, including JUnit XML and TestDox. Vulnerabilities A vulnerability that allowed attackers to execute remote code via PHPUnit was discovered in late 2017. By sending a payload of PHP code to a file that is part of PHPUnit, an attacker could execute PHP code on the webserver.

This ancient record of the cultural history is in vogue even now. The rock arts are in granite formations and consist of art depictions attributed to the hunter gatherer community of BaTwa who lived here during the stone age period, and of the farming community of Chewa who are traced to the Iron Age period. In view of this cultural importance, the area was inscribed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2006 under Criteria III for the rich cultural traditions of rock art and Criteria VI for its continued link to the present society. The rock art symbolizing rituals and ceremonies is mostly the creation of the women folk of Chewa clan. The \\"agropastoralist\\" art form of the tribes, which represents their perception of use and control of their natural habitat, was continued by the Bantu tribes in Changoni. Geography The rock art sites are near the mountainous region of Dedza () which is the highest town in Malawi (about () south-east of Lilongwe) which was settled during pre-historic times. It is reported to be the ‚Äúdensest cluster of rock art‚Äù in Central Africa. The 127 sites identified in the Malawi plateau are spread over an area of . Located on the hill slopes of the forested area, the projecting rocks provide protection to the rock art sites. Of the 127 sites, five are outside the demarcated limits of the Chongoni Forest Reserve. Legal status The rock art and archaeological sites of Chongoni are protected under The Monuments and Relics Act of 1990, which provides for protection of the rock arts. Further, the Chongoni Forest Reserve, declared a protected area under the Forestry Act of 1997, encompasses most of the rock art sites. These two legal provisions are in accordance with the Government policy on preservation of cultural heritage. History Archaeological antiquaries of the early Stone Age period found in the area provides links to the Upper Pleistocene age. Artifacts dated to 2,500 BP have also been found establishing the Late Stone Age period habitation of the site by hunter gatherers who are credited with creation of this rock art. Iron Age settlements are traced from 1st millennium AD when white rock art form came to be depicted by the farmers. The natural figures were made with white clay. The farming community and the hunter gatherers worked in unison till the 19th century when the latter group were subsumed in to the farming group. It was in the 15th century that the Maravi Chewa group (after whom the country is named as Malawi) migrated from the northwestern region of Lubaland, unified all the groups and established the Maravi Empire. Then followed the Ngoni people who fled from South Africa and settled in the southern region of the Chongoni area. This resulted in the local Nyau people, who were opposed to the Ngoni, move to hiding places. It is this Nyau community, in spite of opposition from the Ngoni, the missionaries and the colonial administration of the country, who have ensured preservation of their culture. After the area was declared a Forest Reserve in 1924 and boundaries of villages demarcated, the first rock art finding was reported in the 1930s, and later in 1950s details of a few sites were published. Five rock art sites out of the total 127 sites were then declared in 1969 as protected national monuments. They were also opened to viewing by the public. Features Following migration of Chewa agriculturalists into the area, white clay was the medium used for painting while their predecessors, BaTwa Pygmies, had the tradition of using red colour in their paintings. This tradition is in vogue even now and is connected with rituals for women's initiation, to usher rain and for other funerary related rites. The rock art also serves as a symbol of the Chewa secret society of the Nyau people. The rock art sites are categorized under four traditions, two belong to the BaTwa Pygmies, the earliest community of hunter gatherers, the agriculturists, the Ngoni invaders, and the colonizers. Details of three of the sites which are open to the public are: The Chentcherere Rock Art Site forming the core area where six rock shelters are located in the Chentcherere hills, described as in the \\"schematic and naturalistic\\" styles; the Namzeze Rock Art Site which consists of paintings in red geometrical pattern and several paintings in white colour; and the Mphunzi Rock Art Site which are \\"zoomorphism\\" paintings.

Terms BuddhƒÅbhiseka is known a number of different terms in various languages. The terms kaiyan (), kaiguang (), and dianyan () and their derivative forms are used in the Chinese, Korean (where is it known as jeom-an or Ï†êÏïà), Japanese (where it is known as kaigen) and Vietnamese languages (where it is known as khai quang ƒëi·ªÉm nh√£n), while buddhƒÅbhiseka (; ; ) is used in predominantly Theravada Buddhist countries. Chinese rituals Kaiguang () is the Chinese term for consecration of a statue of a deity. In Chinese, the literal meaning of Kaiguang is \\"opening of light\\". While it is often performed in the Buddhist and Taoist faiths, it is also well known as the act of consecrating new lion costumes used for the traditional lion dance. A kaiguang ritual varies amongst traditions, but it is essentially the act of formal consecration for proper usage by dotting the eyes of a statue or lion costume using a calligraphy brush coated with cinnabar. In Taoism and Buddhism, the ritual is performed by senior clerics and is done by inviting a specific deity, buddha or bodhisattva to empower an \\"empty\\" effigy of themselves and to fill it with a divine essence. The usage of a mirror (to reflect the sunlight) and a dry towel (to symbolically clean the statue of filth) is also employed. It is believed that if a statue or lion costume has not gone through kaiguang, it cannot be worshiped or used for performance, as the eyes are still \\"closed\\". Burmese rituals Burmese Buddhists perform consecration rituals for images of the Buddha used for veneration both at home and at public places of worship, such as monasteries and pagodas. Before a Buddha statue is used for veneration, it must be formally consecrated in the buddhƒÅbhiseka ma·πÖgala ritual. The Burmese language verb for consecrating a Buddha image is anegaza tin (). This consecration ritual is led by a Buddhist monk, who recites aneka jƒÅti sa·πÉsƒÅra·πÉ (translated as 'through the round of many births I roamed'), the 153rd verse of the Dhammapada (found in the 11th chapter), which are believed to be the first words uttered by the Buddha upon attaining Buddhahood. The consecration rite, which can last a few hours, is held in the morning and consists of four primary parts: # Offerings (candles, flowers, incense, flags) made to the Buddha # Chanting of paritta (typically Mangala Sutta, Metta Sutta, Ratana Sutta, Pubbhana Sutta) # Recitation of aneka jƒÅti sa·πÉsƒÅra·πÉ # Recitation of the Twelve NidƒÅnas The consecration rituals are believed to imbue the Buddha image with a sacred quality that can protect the home and surroundings from misfortune and symbolically embody the powers of the Buddha.

The Caprock Chief or Caprock Xpress was a proposed Amtrak inter-city rail service which would run from Fort Worth, Texas to Denver, Colorado, passing through the Texas Panhandle, which currently does not have passenger rail service of any kind. Initially proposed 2000-2001, the project has not yet seen significant progress and is unlikely to be implemented. \\"Caprock\\" is a geological term for a harder or more resistant rock type overlying a weaker or less resistant rock type, and lends its name to the Caprock Escarpment that defines the edge of the high plains of the Llano Estacado. Route The train would run west from Fort Worth across northern Texas, then turn north to run through the Texas Panhandle and the western edge of Oklahoma before entering Colorado. It would serve the following communities: *Texas: Fort Worth, Weatherford, Eastland, Abilene, Sweetwater, Lubbock, Plainview, Amarillo *Oklahoma: Boise City *Colorado: La Junta, Pueblo, Colorado Springs, Littleton, and Denver Both Fort Worth and Denver are served by long-distance trains (the Texas Eagle and California Zephyr, respectively), but there has not been single-train service between the two cities since the Texas Zephyr ended in 1967. , any such trip would require changing trains in Illinois or California, a detour of over a thousand miles. Fort Worth is also served by the Heartland Flyer, which connects it to Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, while La Junta is a stop on the transcontinental Southwest Chief. None of the other proposed station stops have train service. In the past there have been proposals to re-route the existing Sunset Limited (Los Angeles--Orlando) farther north to serve the Fort Worth--Sweetwater segment. Development The impetus for the route came from the Texas Association of Rail Passengers (TARP), which lobbied local governments to support the concept. In late 2001 a visit by Amtrak officials to Lubbock produced discussion, but no commitment from the corporation. In early 2002 the Amarillo City Commission voted unanimously in favor of \\"a resolution supporting proposed Amtrak rail service expansion to provide a direct route through the Panhandle of Texas from Fort Worth, Texas to Denver, Colorado via the Caprock Chief line.\\" The Lubbock chamber of commerce also voiced its support for the route, with 92% of its members in favor. Commenting on the proposal, representative Mac Thornberry warned that \\"Having Amtrak service through the Panhandle would be a good thing for our region...but it won't be easy. Our nation's rail infrastructure faces some serious challenges, and Amtrak is already heavily subsidized by the taxpayers. Any new routes will have to improve Amtrak's financial situation, rather than make it worse.\\" By 2004 the president of the TARP acknowledged that the proposal was dead: \\"It's probably years off before this can be considered...We figure you've got to start talking about it at some point. It has to be an idea and you have to develop that idea.\\" The proposal reemerged in 2013‚Äì2014, when Amtrak contemplated re-routing the Southwest Chief via Amarillo.

Misty was a collection of one-off single stories and instalments of serials, both story types usually being four-page-long. Summer and holiday specials were published between 1978 and 1980, as well as eight annuals from 1979 until 1986, long after the weekly magazine had ceased to exist. While there were similarities with its Fleetway stablemates Tammy and Jinty, each magazine had its own focus. Misty concentrated on supernatural and horror stories, featuring plots such as \\"pacts with the devil, schoolgirl sacrifice, the ghosts of hanged girls, sinister cults, evil scientists experimenting on the innocent and terrifying parallel worlds where the Nazis won the second world war.\\" One-off stories often had troublemaking protagonists being punished in fantastic fashion. Text stories were initially new stories, but later shifted to retellings of British ghost stories, some of which were submitted by readers. Misty had no regular characters except for its host, Misty, and the cartoon witch Miss T. This cartoon attracted debate among readers as to whether its comic relief weakened or complemented the dark tones of Misty. After the merger, Miss T joined the Edie strip in Tammy, which eventually became The Crayzees when Snoopa joined in the Tammy and Jinty merger on 28 November 1981, and continued until the Tammy and Princess merger on 7 April 1984. \\"The Cult of the Cat\\" and \\"The Black Widow\\" were the only Misty stories to have sequels, although the sequel for the latter was published in Tammy. The Misty back catalogue is now owned by Rebellion Developments, which has reprinted the serials Moonchild,The Four Faces of Eve, The Sentinels, End of the Line, and Wolf Girl, and is due to republish further series as part of The Treasury of British Comics.2000 AD to revive children's comics from the '70s and '80s  The Bookseller In October 2017 Rebellion published a Scream! & Misty Halloween Special, which contained all-new stories featuring characters from those comics.

Like many other houses in Jabal Amman, such as the Mango House across the street, 70 years has given the Mufti House time for a significantly wooded front yard to develop. A stair-stepped stone wall covered in ivy separates it from the main street. History The Mufti House was built in the late 1920s in the style of the Akrawi and Habb√∂o House located to the south. Built by Umar Hikmat, a prominent Circassian, the house was sold to a fellow Circassian politician, Sa'id al-Mufti, in the mid-1930s. Mufti, who would later become the mayor of Amman, made numerous additions to the house as his prestige as a politician grew. A new kitchen, toilets and a dining room were added, in what would eventually become the present-day house. Most significantly, Mufti added the notable front porch during the 1950s. Around the same time, another house was built to the east of the original house by Shawkat, Mufti's brother. Mufti eventually moved into the house, where he stayed until his death. Sa'id, Mufti's wife, resides in the house today. Architecture Similar in style to the Akrawi and Habb√∂o house, the Mufti House features a wide aqua-green front exposure, very much in the style of that era of Amman architecture. The front porticoed balcony features rose-stone columns similar to the stone used by the Mango House across the street.

From 1900 to the 1960s lead mining and zinc mining companies left behind open chat piles that were heavily contaminated by these metals, cadmium, and others. Metals from the mining waste leeched into the soil, and seeped into groundwater, ponds, and lakes. Elevated lead, zinc and manganese levels in Picher children have led to learning disabilities and other health problems. The EPA declared Picher to be one of the most toxic areas in the United States.\\"Pollution busts Okla. mining town\\" Associated Press (c/o NBC News), 12 May 2008Juozapavicius, Justin \\"Oklahoma Town Is Toxic Waste Site\\" Associated Press - (c/o San Francisco Chronicle, 27 February 2007 The Quapaw Tribe of Oklahoma originally owned the area and leased property to mining companies. Government rules restricted many Quapaw landowners from realizing money from royalties, which companies paid on these leases. The people have suffered adverse health effects, including high rates of miscarriage and neurological damage to children, as a result of the unregulated mining activities. The Tar Creek Superfund site is the Oklahoma section of four National Priority List (NPL) Superfund Sites that together encompass the Tri- State mining district, an old lead and zinc mining district divided by the EPA into the Tar Creek Site (Ottawa County, Oklahoma), Cherokee County Site (Cherokee County, Kansas), the Orongo-Duenweg Site (Jasper County, Missouri), and the Newton County Mine Tailings Site (Newton County, Missouri). Origins This image, taken in 2010, shows a chat pile near Picher, Okla. These piles contain lead-contaminated dust and are one of the reasons the area was designated a Superfund site. Tar Creek is an area of 1,188 square miles located in Ottawa County, Oklahoma, within the Tri-State district of lead and zinc mining in Northeastern Oklahoma, Southwestern Missouri, and Southeastern Kansas. The first mining took place in Missouri around 1850. By 1908, sites had been started in Miami, Picher, and Commerce. The construction of railroads in the area stimulated production, increasing access to markets. Mining quickly had a high economic impact, and by 1924 most of the young, American- born whites in the district were employed by the mining industry.Dianna Everett Tri-State Lead and Zinc District Oklahoma Historical Society, 2009, retrieved 7.7.2017. The Quapaw tended to keep out of these endeavors, largely in part due to the racial divide during this time. ry. When mining began in the area, most of the land was owned by the federally recognized Quapaw tribe. Following the Oklahoma Organic Act, an 1897 court ruling would allow allotted land to be leased for the purpose of mining but would later be curtailed by numerous subsequent lawsuits. Only about one sixth of Quapaw landowners would ever receive land lease payments and mined mineral royalties. Between 1915 and 1930, decreasing demand and production caused mining companies to buy the land rather than lease it, which led to high consolidation of companies. During World War I, the region supplied 45 percent of the lead and 50 percent of the zinc used by the U.S. Zinc and lead were used for bullets during both World Wars. Advances in technology increased production. 1926 was the highest year of production in the area, and Ottawa County became the world's largest source of lead and zinc, employing 11,000 men in almost 250 mills. Between 1908 and 1950, the entire Tri-State Mining Region had generated over an estimated 1 billion U.S. dollars. After 1950, many mines were shut down, largely because their adverse environmental impacts on soil, groundwater and air had been found. National and state intervention The mining waste was located very close to neighborhoods in the town of Picher. In the 1960s and 1970s, health and environmental hazards were found at mining and industrial sites across America, such as Times Beach and Love Canal. On December 11, 1980, Congress passed the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA). CERCLA¬¥s environmental programs and initiatives are referred to as the Superfund: hazardous sites were identified and financing was allocated to remediate them. The EPA established a Hazard Ranking system and a National Priorities List in 1981 and 1982, respectively. On September 8, 1983, the Tar Creek site was designated a Superfund site, with the USGS, the Oklahoma Department of Environmental Quality (ODEQ), and the Quapaw Tribe acting as the cleanup oversight agencies (though the EPA works as lead for USGS)Land Protection Division Tar Creek Section Oklahoma Department of Environmental Quality (ODEQ) 19 May 2017, retrieved 7 July 17 In 1984, work on the first Operable Unit (OU1) began. Twenty years later, in 2004, the state of Oklahoma enacted the \\"Oklahoma Plan For Tar Creek\\", but by 2006, most of this money was allocated to a buy out and relocation program, because of the immediate health hazards to people still living in the area. Health and environmental hazards \\"Dry\\" and \\"wet\\" methods were used by mining companies to extract pure lead from ore. Dry methods produced chat piles, large mounds of mining waste, and wet methods required tailing ponds to process ore into a usable product. The Oklahoma Plan for Tar Creek claimed around 75 million tons of chat piles exist, while the exact amount of tailings is unknown. It was not uncommon for children in the area to play around the chat piles, such as riding bikes up and down the large piles or swimming in waters contaminated by their dust or groundwater effects. Some of the piles were used for school students for track practice. Lead poisoning is especially hazardous to children under six years of age. High levels of lead at this age can produce impaired neurological development that results in lifelong problems. A 1996 study showed 43% of children ages 1‚Äì5 had blood lead concentrations above the threshold considered dangerous by federal standards though more recent reports show this number to be lower. Another indication of hazard is the 24% miscarriage rate for women in the area, compared to a national average of 10%.Abigail Estes Cherokee Nation and Tar Creek 22 pages, n.d. The Center for Hazardous Substance Research, Kansas State University, Manhattan, KS Empty mines present an immediate danger due to mine collapses. One collapse in 1967 took nine homes. Between 2002 and 2011 pregnant Mothers of the Tar Creek area and their infants enrolled into a study and were followed until children were 2 years old. The concentration of manganese in the Tar Creek mother¬¥s blood at or near the time of delivery was associated with lower neurodevelopment scores at 2 years of age.Claus Henn B, Bellinger DC, Hopkins MR, Coull BA, Ettinger AS, Jim R, Hatley E, Christiani DC, Wright ROMaternal and Cord Blood Manganese Concentrations and Early Childhood Neurodevelopment among Residents near a Mining-Impacted Superfund Site Environ Health Perspect; DOI:10.1289/EHP925 =Damage to water resources and aquatic life= To keep groundwater from saturating the mines while they were active, water was pumped out of mines. This created a large depression where mining activities occurred. waste materials and poor quality ore were stored in Mined-out portions or exploration holes dug to map out mining areas, instead of removing them from the mines. These waste materials reacted with moist air and oxidized. When mining ceased in the 1960s, so did the active pumping of water out of the mines. Thus, water flowed back into the depressions, the mines flooded and reacted with the oxidized and now more reactive heavy metals left over. Eventually, enough water filled the mines allowing water to travel to the surface, forming \\"springs\\" of contaminated water at the site of the exploratory drilling holes. In 1979, the first contaminated springs of water were documented. In 1980, Picher first recorded contaminated water drawn from the town's aquifer.Bruce Sheibach, R., Williams, R.E. & Genes, B.R. Controlling acid mine drainage from the Ficher Mining District, Oklahoma, United States. International Journal of Mine Water (1982) 1: 45. doi:10.1007/BF02504607 Lead has marked adverse environmental impacts in aquatic systems. Water from the region eventually drains into the Grand Lake o' the Cherokees, which has raised lead levels. A health advisory warns people to limit the number of fish they consume from this area.SHAUN SCHAFER Part One In a Five-Part Series: Superfund: Damage Control 12 December 2003, retrieved 7 July 2017 Estimates in 1982 showed lead and cadmium levels in the underground aquifer of Picher were five times the national standards for drinking water. Mine water has to be treated to prevent its contaminating other clean water sources, such as nearby Grand Lake, which already has elevated levels of lead due to mining activities. Photosynthetic organisms in the water have no means to dispose of heavy metals they absorb and accumulate these. Any animal or fish that feeds on this primary producer accumulates the higher concentrations of these contaminants, as the primary producer has a higher concentration of heavy metals relative to the water. Secondary and tertiary consumers accumulate even higher concentrations of such metals in a process called biomagnification). Since humans consume fish rather than phytoplankton, they are considered a secondary consumer, and are at high risk of lead poisoning from fish taken from contaminated lakes. Clean up, 1983‚Äìpresent day Since the passage of CERCLA, numerous clean up efforts have been made in the area. Some of the surface water contamination was dealt with in the 1980s and 1990s, and in 2000, Governor Frank Keating commissioned development of a cleanup plan, later known as the \\"Oklahoma Plan\\". In 2002, DEQ studied fish from waters in the Tri-State mining district. Tar Creek issued a fish consumption advisory. The State of Oklahoma restored 329 acres of contaminated land in 2005, and the following year offered a voluntary buyout to affected families with children. The EPA got involved in 2010, offering additional voluntary buyouts and doing additional cleanup. The Oklahoma Plan for Tar Creek has listed four main objectives in the process: improving surface water quality, reducing exposure to lead dust, attenuating mine hazards, and land reclamation. The University of Oklahoma's Department of Civil Engineering and Environmental Science has implemented a 1.2 million dollar passive water treatment system. The system bioremediates ground water from abandoned mines using a series of ponds to naturally remove lead, zinc, cadmium and iron from the water. It discharges into a tributary of Tar Creek. It uses gravity and renewable energy to flow water through a filtration system, composed of aerobic and anaerobic bacteria treatments, and periodic oxidation of treated waters. It has greatly reduced heavy metals in treated waters. To reduce lead dust, the Oklahoma plan proposes to pave over chat roads and otherwise encapsulate chat. A chat and asphalt mixture may also be used to fill mines, which will reduce the threat of mine hazards‚Äînamely, the collapse of mines and/or the exposure to lead due to open or collapsed mines. Finally, the plan calls to restore and revegetate the land damaged by mining activities. New soil will be brought in to replace removed soil. One 2011 estimate claims an additional 3.2 million dollars will be sufficient to remediate the more than 400 mining sites remaining in the area. The municipality of Picher was officially dissolved in November, 2013. EPA chief Scott Pruitt was still being criticized by local residents in 2017 for the way in which the 33-year cleanup has been conducted. On September 17, 2019 the EPA, in cooperation with the state of Oklahoma and the Quapaw Nation, released the Final Tar Creek Strategic Plan to advance the cleanup of the Tar Creek Superfund site. The EPA indicated while great progress had been made, much work was yet to be done, and the Plan was a commitment to accelerate the cleanup. Representation in other media A 2009 documentary film, Tar Creek, written, directed, and narrated by Matt Myers, covers the gamut of the issues related to the Tar Creek Superfund site, including lead poisoning, mine waste, acid mine water, sinkholes, governmental practices showing racism against the Quapaw Tribe, downstream expansion of the superfund site, and the eventual federal buyout of the residents of the area. During the fall of 2010, Tar Creek toured to many of the nation's existing Superfund sites as part of the Superfund Screening Tour. Universities, organizations, churches, and schools used the story of Tar Creek to have a discussion about what could happen in their communities.

The word is used in the classification of the degrees or stages of Christian perfection, or the advancement of souls in the supernatural life of grace during their sojourn in the world. This has reference to the practice of all the virtues, both theological virtues and moral virtues, and to all their acts both external and internal. It includes two elements, namely a believer's own efforts and the grace of God assisting the believer. This article takes up the latter of the senses described in the above paragraph, according to the various classes of souls who aspire to perfection in this life. The Catholic Church Fathers and theologians distinguish three stages or states of perfection. These are the state of beginners, state of the progressing, and state of the perfect. These states are also designated \\"ways\\" because they are the ways in which God guides souls to Himself. Stages of Christian perfection This traditional division of the spiritual life has been maintained since Pseudo-Dionysius, late 5th century Christian theologian, and the three states can be named, respectively, the \\"purgative way\\", the \\"illuminative way\\", and the \\"unitive way\\".See St. Thomas Aquinas, OP, Summa Theologiae, Second Part of the Second part, Question 163, Article 4; and Francisco Suarez, De Religione, Tr. 8, Lib. 1, C. 13. Among the 68 propositions from the writings of Miguel de Molinos condemned by the Holy Office of the Inquisition and ratified by Pope Innocent XI was the following: \\"These three kinds of way, the purgative, illuminative, and unitive, are the greatest absurdity in Mystical Theology.\\"Cf. Constitution \\"Coelestis Pastor\\" of Pope Innocent XI (1687). Various descriptions and elaborations of these three ways are given by 16th century theologians, e.g. Teresa of Avila and John of the Cross. =The purgative way= The purgative way (, k√°tharsis \\"purification\\") is the way, or state, of those who are beginners, that is, those who have obtained justification but do not have their passions in such a state of subjugation, i.e., obedience to their intellects, that they can easily overcome temptations, and who, in order to preserve and increase the virtue of charity and the other virtues, have to continually combat their disordered passions. The distinctive characteristics of this state are war against those temptations that entice the soul to sin, i.e. attractions of sensual pleasure and repugnance to acts known to be in conformity to the will of God. The characteristic virtue of this state is humility, by which the soul is becomes increasingly apprised of its own weakness and its dependence upon the grace of God. What mystical writers describe as the active and passive purifications of the spiritual life may be brought under, and arranged according to, their three states of perfection, though not confined to any one of them.E.g., John of the Cross, Ascent of Mount Carmel, especially Book 1. The active purification consists of all the holy efforts, mortifications, labors, and sufferings by which the soul, aided by the grace of God, endeavors to reform the mind, heart, and sensitive appetite. This is the characteristic work of the purgative way. The passive purifications are the means God employs to purify the soul from its vices and to prepare it for the exceptional graces of the supernatural life. In the works of St. John of the Cross, OCD, these purifications are called \\"nights\\", and he divides them into two classes: the night of the senses and the night of the spirit.John of the Cross, The Ascent of Mount Carmel, especially Book 1. In the state of beginners the soul is often favored by God with what are called \\"sensible consolations\\" because they have their beginning and are felt chiefly in the senses. They consist in sensible devotion and a feeling of fervour arising from the consideration of God's goodness, vividly represented to the mind and heart; or from external aids, such as the ceremonies of the Church. These consolations are often withdrawn by God and followed by a state of desolation. At this point the passive purification of the senses begins. =The illuminative way= The illuminative way (, the≈çr√≠a \\"contemplation\\") is that of those who are in the state of progress and have their passions better under control, so that they easily keep themselves from mortal sin, but who do not so easily avoid venial sins, because they still take pleasure in earthly things and allow their minds to be distracted by various imaginations and their hearts with numberless desires, though not in matters that are strictly unlawful. It is called the illuminative way, because in it the mind becomes more and more enlightened as to spiritual things and the practice of virtue. In this grade charity is stronger and more perfect than in the state of beginners; the soul is chiefly occupied with progress in the spiritual life and in all the virtues, both theological and moral. The practice of prayer suitable for this state is meditation on the mysteries of the Incarnation, the life of Our Savior, and the mysteries of his Sacred Passion. As Ven. Luis de Lapuente says, :Though the mysteries of the Passion belong to the illuminative way, especially in its highest degree, which approaches nearest to the unitive way, nevertheless, they are exceedingly profitable for all sorts of persons, by whatever way they walk, and in whatever degree of perfection they live; for sinners will find in them most effectual motives to purify themselves from all their sins; beginners to mortify their passions; proficients to increase in all kinds of virtue; and the perfect to obtain union with God by fervent love.Introduction to Meditations on the Passion The fundamental virtue of this state is recollection, that is, a constant attention of the mind and of the affections of the heart to thoughts and sentiments that elevate the soul to God. Exterior recollection is the love of silence and retirement. Interior recollection is simplicity of spirit and a right intention, as well as attention to God in all our actions. This does not mean a person has to neglect the duties of his state or position in life, nor does it imply that honest and needful recreation should be avoided, because these lawful or necessary circumstances or occupations can well be reconciled with perfect recollection and the most holy union with God. The soul in the illuminative way will have to experience periods of spiritual consolations and desolations. It does not at once enter upon the unitive way when it has passed through the aridities of the first purgation. It must spend some time, perhaps years, after quitting the state of beginners in exercising itself in the state of proficients. St. John of the Cross tells us that in this state the soul, like one released from a rigorous imprisonment, occupies itself in Divine thoughts with a much greater freedom and satisfaction, and its joy is more abundant and interior than it ever experienced before it entered the night of the senses. Its purgation is still somewhat incomplete, and the purification of the senses is not yet finished and perfect. It is not without aridities, darkness, and trials, sometimes more severe than in the past. During the period of desolation it will have to endure much suffering from temptations against the theological virtues and against the moral virtues. It will have to endure sometimes other diabolical attacks upon its imagination and senses. Also, God will permit natural causes to combine in afflicting the soul, such as the persecutions of men, and the ingratitude of friends. Patient suffering and resignation have to be borne during all these trials, and the devout soul should remember the words of Blosius: And again he says: \\"It is the chain of patient suffering that forms the ring with which Christ espouses a soul to Himself.\\" =The unitive way= The unitive way (, th√©≈çsis \\"deification\\") is the way of those who are in the state of the perfect, that is, those who have their minds so drawn away from all temporal things that they enjoy great peace, who are neither agitated by various desires nor moved to any great extent by passion, and who have their minds chiefly fixed on God and their attention turned, either always or very frequently, to Him. It is the union with God by love and the actual experience and exercise of that love. It is called the state of \\"perfect charity\\", because souls who have reached that state are ever prompt in the exercise of charity by loving God habitually and by frequent and efficacious acts of that Divine virtue. It is called the \\"unitive\\" way because it is by love that the soul is united to God, and the more perfect the charity, the closer and more intimate is the union. Union with God is the principal study and endeavor of this state. It is of this union St. Paul speaks when he says: \\"He who is joined to the Lord, is one spirit.\\".I Corinthians 6:17. Souls thus united to God are penetrated by the highest motives of the theological and moral virtues. In every circumstance of their lives the supernatural motive that ought to guide their actions is ever present to their mind, and the actions are performed under its inspiration with a force of will that makes their accomplishment easy and even delightful. These perfect souls are above all familiar with the doctrine and use of consolations and desolations. They are enlightened in the mysteries of the supernatural life, and they have experience of that truth proclaimed by St. Paul when he said: \\"We know that to them that love God, all things work together unto good, to such as, according to His purpose, are called to be saints.\\" (Romans 8:28). The form of prayer suitable to persons in the unitive way is the contemplation of the glorious mysteries of Our Lord, His Resurrection, Appearances, and Ascension, until the coming of the Holy Ghost, and the preaching of the Gospel. These mysteries may also be the subject of meditation for beginners and for those in a state of progress, but in a peculiar manner they belong to the perfect. Union with God belongs substantially to all souls in a state of grace, but it is in a special manner the distinguishing characteristic of those in the unitive way or in the state of the perfect. It is in this state that the gift of contemplation is imparted to the soul, though this is not always the case; because many souls who are perfect in the unitive way never receive in this life the gift of contemplation, and there have been numerous saints who were not mystics or contemplatives and who nevertheless excelled in the practice of heroic virtue. Souls, however, who have attained to the unitive state have consolations of a purer and higher order than others, and are more often favored by extraordinary graces; and sometimes with the extraordinary phenomena of the mystical state such as ecstasies, raptures, and what is known as the prayer of union. The soul, however, is not always in this state free from desolations and passive purgation. St. John of the Cross tells us that the purification of the spirit usually takes place after the purification of the senses. The night of the senses being over, the soul for some time enjoys, according to this eminent authority, the sweet delights of contemplation; then, perhaps, when least expected the second night comes, far darker and far more miserable than the first, and this is called by him the purification of the spirit, which means the purification of the interior faculties, the intellect and the will. The temptations that assail the soul in this state are similar in their nature to those that afflict souls in the illuminative way, only more aggravated, because felt more keenly.;The withdrawal of the consolations of the spirit they have already experienced is their greatest affliction. To these trials are added others, peculiar to the spirit, which arise from the intensity of their love for God, for Whose possession they thirst and long. \\"The fire of Divine love can so dry up the spirit and enkindle its desire for satisfying its thirst that it turns upon itself a thousand times and longs for God in a thousand ways, as the Psalmist did when he said: For Thee my soul hath thirsted; for Thee my flesh O how many ways.\\"St. John of the Cross, op. cit. infra, bk. II, xi. There are three degrees of this species of suffering designated by mystical writers as the \\"inflammation of love\\", the \\"wounds of love\\", and the \\"langour of love\\". States of consolation and desolation Consolation and desolation may be said to be phases of the various stages or states of the spiritual life, rather than distinct states to themselves. =Consolation= In the spiritual order consolation is of three kinds. The first kind, known as \\"sensible consolation,\\" has its beginning and is felt chiefly in the senses or sensible faculties. It consists of sensible devotion and a feeling of fervour arising from the consideration of God's goodness vividly represented to the mind and heart; or from the external aids and ceremonies of the Church. It is not to be disregarded on this account because it leads us finally to good. St. Alphonsus says, \\"Spiritual consolations are gifts much more precious than all the riches and honors of the world. And if the sensibility itself is aroused, this completes our devotion, for then our whole being is united to God and tastes God.\\" (Love for Jesus, xvii). The second kind of consolation, which is often the result of the first, and usually remains with the third, is characterized by a facility and even a delight in the exercise of the virtues, especially the theological virtues. St. Ignatius says that any increase in faith, hope, and charity may be called a consolation (Rule 3 for the discernment of spirits). By this kind of consolation the soul is raised above the sensible faculties; and in the absence of sensible consolation, truth is perceived at a glance, faith alone operating, enlightening, directing and sustaining the soul, and fervour of the will follows sensible fervour. We should be thankful to God for consolations of this kind and pray for their continuance, and it is these we ask for in the prayer \\"En ego\\" usually recited after Communion. The third kind of consolation affects the higher faculties of the soul, namely the intellect and the will, and in a more perfect way than the second. It consists in special tranquillity and peace of soul, and is the result of the firm determination of the will to live for God with entire confidence in His grace. It is present when, as St. Ignatius says, \\"the soul burns with the love of its Creator, and can no longer love any creature except for His sake\\" (Rule 3 for the discernment of spirits). The soul is conscious of its happiness even though the inferior and sensible faculties may be depressed and afflicted. This is the most perfect kind of all, and it is not often experienced except by the perfect. As the first kind is said to belong to beginners in the way of perfection, the second to those making progress, so the third is said to belong to the perfect. =Desolation= Spiritual desolation or spiritual dryness means the feeling of abandonment by God, and of the absence of His grace. This feeling of estrangement may arise from various causes. It may be the result of natural disposition or temperament, or of external circumstances; or it may come from the attacks of the devil; or from God Himself when for our greater good He withdraws from us spiritual consolation. In contradistinction to consolation, spiritual desolation may be of three kinds. The first is called sensible desolation and is the opposite of sensible consolation. It includes aridities, dissipation of mind, weariness, and disgust in the exercises of piety; and it is often experienced by beginners in the practice of mental prayer. It may co- exist with consolation of a higher order, just as in the natural order we may experience pain of body and joy of spirit at one and the same time. The second kind of desolation affects the intellect and will, and consists in the privation of the feeling of the presence of the supernatural virtues as described by St. Teresa of Avila in her Life (ch. xxx). This trial is extremely severe, but if generously accepted and patiently endured, it may be turned into great merit, and many fruits of sanctity will be the result. (See Letter of St. Francis of Sales to St. Jane Frances de Chantal, 28 March 1612). The third kind of desolation is still more severe. It is a darkening of the mind and a feeling of abandonment so great that the soul is tempted to distrust concerning salvation and is tormented by other terrible thoughts against faith, against purity, and even by blasphemous thoughts‚Äîthe most painful experience a holy soul has to endure (see St. John of the Cross, op. cit., infra, bk. I, ch. xiv). It would be a great mistake to imagine that spiritual desolation arrests progress in virtue or enfeebles the spirit of fervour. On the contrary, it affords occasion of heroic virtue and of absolute detachment from sensible pleasure, whether natural or supernatural. At the same time we may hope and wish that these interior griefs may be diminished or made to disappear, and we may pray God to deliver us from them, but if all our efforts are in vain, and God permits the desolation to continue, it only remains to resign ourselves generously to His Divine Will. Directions Francisco Su√°rez teaches that: God sometimes withholds the favors of the unitive way from many faithful and fervent souls who have advanced generously in the degrees of the purgative and illuminative ways. As regards the gift of contemplation, it is sometimes granted to the imperfect and even to beginners so that they may taste of its sweetness. Souls by the exercise of Christian asceticism can prepare themselves for this intimate communication with God, but they should await with humility and patience the time and occasion. For the better understanding of the three states or ways in their relations to each other and their effects upon souls tending toward perfection the following directions and observations may be useful. * The three states or ways are not so entirely distinct that there may not appear in any one of them something of the other two. In each and all of them is found the effort and care to preserve and guard the soul from sin, though this is said to belong (appropriately) to the purgative way; in each, virtue has to be practiced, and from its practice light and progress result. Again, in each of them the soul gives itself to God to live in Him and for Him the supernatural life which He imparts to it, and this may be said to be the commencement of the unitive way. The characteristic and distinctive feature of these states is determined by the form which is dominant in the soul in its efforts toward perfection. When strife and fear predominate, the soul is said to be still in the purgative way. If charity is dominant above all the soul is in the unitive way; but so long as this mortal life lasts, for the strong and the feeble there will always be the labor and activity of purgation, illumination, and of union in the work of supernatural perfection. Suarez teaches this doctrine in very distinct terms saying, again: \\"These three states are never so distinct that any one of them may not participate of the other two. Each of them takes its name and character from that which predominates in it. And it is certain that no one can attain to such a state of perfection in this life that he may not or cannot make further progress.\\" (De Orat., I. II, c. xi, n. 4). * According to the usual manner of advancement, the majority of souls are gradually raised to the state of perfect union after passing through the states of purification and illumination. But this rule is by no means absolute, and a miraculous intervention of an extraordinary grace may bring a soul suddenly from the lowest depths of moral abjection to the most sublime heights of charity, as may be seen in the case of St. Mary Magdalen and other celebrated penitent saints. On the other hand, we may find saints in whom the purgative state may predominate even to the end of their lives, and God sometimes withholds the favors of the unitive way from many faithful and fervent souls who have advanced generously in the degrees of the purgative and illuminative ways, and who have all along preserved the fervour of holy charity, which is the essence and crown of perfection. * As a rule, supernatural phenomena of mysticism appear in the most perfect state, namely that of union; one special favor of the mystical life, namely spiritual espousals, supposes the unitive way, and cannot be ascribed to either of the inferior grades of perfection. Many of the other mystical favors, such as ecstasies, visions, locutions, etc., may be found, by way of exception, in the less advanced stages of the spiritual life. As regards the gift of contemplation, although it is proper to those who are perfect in virtue and holiness, still it is sometimes granted to the imperfect and even to beginners so that they may taste of its sweetness. Souls by the exercise of Christian asceticism can prepare themselves for this intimate communication with God, but they should await with humility and patience the time and occasion in which they are to be introduced by their heavenly Spouse into the mystical state of contemplation. * In order to decide as to the dispositions required for frequent and daily communion, it is no longer necessary for a spiritual director to find out or to judge whether a soul is in one or other of these states according to the rules laid down by some modern theologians. All that is now required, as stated in the first clause of the Decree of the Sacred Congregation of the Council of 20 December 1905, is that the recipient be in a state of grace and approach the Holy Table with a right intention. As already stated, these three states are not easily distinguishable, and the lines of demarcation between them cannot easily be discerned, and therefore could not have been regarded at any time as very useful as a rule of guidance for frequent Communion. Now the rule is inapplicable, for those in the purgative way may receive Holy Communion just as often as those who are in the illuminative and unitive, as is evident from the decree referred to. We are not, however, to suppose that the rules given by theologians and ascetical writers, founded as they are on the teachings of the ancient Fathers, with regard to Holy Communion according to the three states or ways no longer serve for edification. They indicate to us what is to be expected as the fruits of frequent Communion received worthily. Frequent Communion is the chief means of preserving and perfecting in our souls the spiritual life, and of supporting it in all its ways.

Introduction Freshly cooked mutton slice in the sesame sauce dip. Instant-boiled mutton, also known as Mongolian Fire Pot or dip-boil mutton, is a Chinese hot pot dish. Traditionally, Chinese people have eaten it inside the home during cold winter weather, but in recent times, instant-boiled mutton has been eaten year-round. It is also eaten in restaurants. Mutton slice often uses different cut from the back (eg. shangnao, sancha, etc.) and rear legs (eg. modang). The tail of the lamb is used to prepare the soup base. History Instant-boiled mutton dates back to the Yuan Dynasty. At one point during a battle, the Khagan of the Mongol Empire, Kublai Khan, had a sudden craving for stewed mutton. However, the enemy's troops were approaching. To satisfy Kublai Khan's desire, a chef quickly cut off a dozen thin mutton slices and put them in boiling water. He removed them as soon as the lamb changed color and put them into a bowl with salt. Kublai Khan finished the mutton quickly and returned to the battle, which he won. At the victory banquet, Kublai Khan requested that the chef make this lamb dish again and named it instant-boiled mutton. Cooking and eating method When instant-boiled mutton is eaten in China, a hot-pot of boiling water is placed in the middle of the table. Tofu, Chinese cabbage, bean sprouts, and vermicelli are normally included in the hot-pot. Lamb is pre- sliced paper-thin into unbroken pieces and served on the table. Eaters pick up some pre-sliced raw lamb using chopsticks, put it in the boiling hot-pot, and remove it as soon as the lamb changes color. Each person has a small bowl to hold sauce for the cooked lamb; the sauce is normally a mixture of sesame sauce, chili oil, leeks, and more.

The new model range (front-engine, eight cylinder grand touring sports car) joined the then current models: the mid-engine eight cylinder sports car, the front-engine twelve cylinder sports car, and the front-engine twelve cylinder grand touring car. =Design= Ferrari California (Monaco) The California represented a radical new design by Pininfarina S.p.A. and was developed under the oversight of Ken Okuyama. The model was primarily intended to attract new Ferrari owners. The car's grand touring personality was emphasized with a slightly higher ride height compared to its more aggressive siblings. The chassis was designed and manufactured by Ferrari division Carrozzeria Scaglietti. Overall, it is considered a landmark car for Ferrari in that it represents a number of concepts being used for the first time in their road cars: * The first front engined Ferrari with a V8 * The first to feature a 7-speed dual-clutch transmission * The first hard top convertible with a folding metal roof * The first with multi-link rear suspension * The first with direct petrol injection The engine displaces , and used a gasoline direct injection system produced by Bosch. It generates a maximum power output of at 7,750 rpm; its maximum torque produced is at 5,000 rpm. The resulting per litre of engine displacement is extremely high for a naturally aspirated engine, as other manufacturers have used forced induction to reach similar power levels. The engine makes use of a wet sump designed lubrication system. The body computer system was developed by Magneti Marelli Automotive Lighting. The California's mid-front engine layout and rear gear box configuration create a 47% front to 53% rear weight distribution. Traction Control The California is equipped with an exclusive Ferrari designed F1-Trac system. The system, originally introduced on the 599 GTB Fiorano, was updated for the model. The variable power distribution to the rear wheels allows greater stability and performance in roadway turns. The result is an average increase of 20% in acceleration when exiting curves (when compared to traditional traction control systems). Configuration The grand touring California was available with two passenger seating configurations. The first option (2+2), included two rear seats that are limited in space and arguably only capable of accommodating small child safety seats. The second option (2+), did away with the rear seats replacing them with a bench storage area. This storage area could accommodate slightly more luggage or personal effects than the seats and included matching leather luggage tie-down belts. Stop/Start Technology The California was the first Ferrari road car to offer stop/start technology. What was an option package and called the HELE system (High Emotion / Low Emission) allowed the engine to shut off while at extended idle and start again immediately upon pushing the accelerator pedal. While this technology was not always well received by many of the Ferrari Tifosi, it did allow for substantial tax savings upon sale in certain governmental jurisdictions. Later Ferrari models also offered this technology. =Performance= The original California had a top speed of and it could accelerate from in four seconds. Although that model was heavier and less powerful than the mid-engined F430, the California reached in the same time as the F430 due to the dual-clutch transmission. =Aerodynamics= Ferrari spent over 1,000 hours in the wind tunnel with a one-third-scale model of the vehicle perfecting its aerodynamics. With the top up, the California has greatly reduced wind resistance with a . The California was, at the time, the most aerodynamic Ferrari road car ever made until the introduction of the F12berlinetta. =Production= The California was manufactured in a purpose built facility that was constructed adjacent to the existing factory at Maranello. The new facility was part of Ferrari's Formula Uomo programme that started in 1997 to improve production, safety and employee happiness. Overall, the Ferrari production line(s) make a total of about 27 cars per day, or between 6,000 and 8,000 cars per year. Production of the California amounted to about 8,000 units spanning between 2008 and 2012. 1,219 cars were manufactured in calendar year 2013; 1,645 in calendar year 2014; and 2,638 in calendar year 2015. 2016 saw production of 2,247 vehicles, and about 1,600 were made in 2017.Total production of all variants was about 17,300 vehicles. Throughout the modern California's history (2008 to 2017), only 3 cars were built with manual transmission, including one order from the UK. =California 30 - 2012 update= On 15 February 2012, Ferrari announced the California 30, an updated model that was lighter and more powerful. While the Pininfarina design remained, the changes included reducing body weight by ; increased power output by and of torque; acceleration time from 0‚Äì100 km/h (62 mph) reduced to 3.8 seconds; introduction of Handling Speciale (HS) package and elimination of the manual transmission option. The ‚Äú30‚Äù has a published top speed of 312 km/h (194 mph) The car was unveiled at the March 2012 Geneva Motor Show as a 2012 model in Europe and as a 2013 model in North America. Deliveries began in Europe first. It was produced in North American model years 2013 and 2014 only. Engine The updated engine continued with the naturally aspirated Ferrari/Maserati F136. Made entirely of aluminium, it retains many of the original features but generates a maximum power output of at 7,750 rpm; its maximum torque produced is 505 Nm (372 ft-lbs) at 5,000 rpm. 75% of which is available at 2,250 rpm. The engine's sound - a feature that distinguishes every Ferrari - was engineered to enhance the vehicle's driving experience both with the top open and closed. The California 30 can be differentiated from the base California by the VIN. In the 30 variant, the VIN's sixth digit (in North America) is ‚ÄúT‚Äù representing the F136IH engine. In the base model, the VIN's sixth digit (again in North America) is ‚ÄúL‚Äù representing the earlier generation F136IB engine. Chassis The California 30 chassis was re-engineered with structural modifications including new materials and aerospace derived construction technologies. It is the first Ferrari road car with a completely modular type chassis and was made entirely of innovative aluminum alloys. It is lighter than the standard California chassis with no loss in structural capacity providing an extremely high torsional rigidity value. Handling Speciale package 2013 Ferrari California HS To give the clients a more dynamic driving experience, an optional HS (Handling Speciale) package was developed as part of the update in 2012 (for the US 2013 model year). It can typically be recognized by a no cost option of a silver coloured grille and silver ventilation blisters behind the front wheel wells. The HS package includes Delphi MagneRide magnetorheological dampers controlled by the ECU with 50% faster response time utilizing a patented Ferrari software, stiffer springs for more precise body control and a steering rack with a 9% quicker steering ratio (2.3 turns lock to lock as opposed to the standard rack's 2.5). Overall it does away with some driving comfort trading it for reduced body roll, higher-speed cornering, and better handling during aggressive vehicle operation. Customization Ferrari has historically been very open to working with customers to develop specific model variants or specialized features. In late 2011, this philosophy was taken up a step with the announcement of the Tailor Made programme. In the program, interested clients work with Ferrari's personal designers in Maranello to assist in decision making throughout the entire process The California 30 was one of the initial models to benefit from this service. =Recall= In May 2012, Ferrari recalled certain vehicles because the engine could freeze suddenly and possibly cause a crash. The F136 engines had crankshafts that were machined incorrectly. The auto maker learned of the problem when it happened during a review by car critics. Owners could choose from having a new engine installed by their dealer, having the engine removed and the work done by Ferrari North America or having a new crankshaft and bearings installed at the dealership. The recall was for a total of 200 vehicles worldwide that were produced in 2011 and 2012. Of those 200 affected vehicles, 74 were delivered to North America. The 200 recalled vehicles were from the California and 458 Italia model ranges.Road & Track, (2012-05-22) Ferrari California T (2014‚Äì2017) California T The Ferrari California T (Type 149M) is an updated design of the California model featuring new sheetmetal and revised body features; a new interior, a revised chassis and a new turbocharged powertrain. It debuted in 2014 for the 2015 model year. First unveiled on the web on February 12, 2014, subsequently, the car debuted at the Geneva Motor Show (March 6‚Äì16, 2014). The T in the moniker stands for Turbo, a technology Ferrari last used on the F40 roadcar. The car utilizes a new twin- turbocharged V8 engine that produces at 7,500 rpm and at 4,750 rpm as well as a 7-speed dual clutch transmission with different gear ratios, a revised MagneRide adaptive suspension, as well as a new F1 Trac system. The car can accelerate from in 3.6 seconds and attain a top speed of . The car also features a new front fascia that was influenced by the F12, a revised rear section and a revised interior. The revised rear end replaced the two sets of two vertically stacked exhaust pipes with four horizontally aligned pipes. Another improvement to the car is the reduction of emission pollution by 15% compared to its naturally aspirated predecessor. The car also utilises small turbo chargers and a variable boost management system to reduce turbo lag. It is also the first Ferrari road car debuting the new Apple CarPlay functionality into its built-in infotainment system ‚Äì Apple confirmed at the launch of the Geneva Motor Show that Ferrari, Mercedes-Benz and Volvo would be among the first car manufacturers to bring CarPlay compatible models to the market. =California T Handling Speciale (2016‚Äì2017)= Similarly to the previous generation, a Handling Speciale (HS) package was made available for the California T, providing sportier handling at the expense of a stiffer ride. The Handling Speciale includes stiffer springs front and aft, retuned magnetorheological dampers, faster gear shifts when in Sport mode, a reprogrammed F1-Trac stability control, and a new sport exhaust system. Visually, the HS package-equipped cars are distinguished by a matte grey grille and rear diffuser, matte black diffuser fences and matte black exhaust tips. The California T Handling Speciale was unveiled at the March 2016 Geneva Motor Show. =Tailor Made= Through the Tailor Made programme, the California T was produced in several special editions and could also be customised to suit individual customers. For Ferrari's 70th anniversary in 2017, this included 70 liveries inspired by the company's iconic cars of the past such as the 250 GT Berlinetta SWB and Steve McQueen's 1963 250 GT Berlinetta lusso. The California T Tailor Made liveries were unveiled at the March 2016 Geneva Motor Show and also shown at other subsequent motor shows such as the October 2016 Paris Motor Show. Marketing The California and California T have both been commemorated by Amalgam Collection in large 1:8 scale diecast replicas. These include hard top and convertible versions. MR Collection and BBR Models have also produced 1:18 and 1:43 scale replicas in hard top and convertible versions, including several different liveries. These replicas are all collectible investment pieces. Mass model manufacturers like Bburago, Maisto, Looksmart and Kyosho have also produced diecast models in 1:18, 1:24, 1:43, and 1:64 scale sizes. Hot Wheels manufactured at least six different California series in 1:18 and 1:43 scales. Other media The California was featured on the British TV show Top Gear (November 2009). The episode centered on a cross country challenge to determine the best grand touring vehicle. The California was matched against the Aston Martin DBS Volante and the Lamborghini Gallardo Spyder. The tour went through the Romanian countryside from the Black Sea to the Carpathian Mountains and across the acclaimed TransfƒÉgƒÉrƒÉ≈üan Highway. The results of the challenge were inconclusive.

It is the flagship broadcast outlet for The Public's Radio (formerly known as Rhode Island Public Radio). Its official community of license is Newport, Rhode Island, but from a tall tower in Tiverton, Rhode Island the signal covers most of Rhode Island and the South Coast of Massachusetts. It also has repeater stations WNPE (102.7 FM) in Narragansett Pier, WELH (88.1 FM) in Providence and WCVY (91.5 FM) in Coventry. The network provides the sole local public radio outlet for Rhode Island. Technical information WNPN transmits using a Nautel GV15 transmitter with 10,187 watts transmitter power output to make 7,000 watts effective radiated power. A Shively Labs 6016 four-panel antenna array is used. An Omnia 9 FM/HD processor from The Telos Alliance is used to keep audio levels consistent. The station broadcasts in digital HD Radio although no multicast HD2 or HD3 channels are transmitted. A 67 kHz subcarrier is transmitted for the Massachusetts Radio Reading Service Audible Local Ledger. History The station signed on June 10, 2006 as WUMD, owned by the University of Massachusetts Dartmouth. WUMD served as a replacement for WSMU- FM, which began with 10 watts of power on 91.1 MHz as WUSM in September 1973. Its first studio was in the cafeteria basement. In the fall of 1974, WUSM moved its studio to the campus center and increased power. It remained a student-programmed station throughout the next three decades. The call letters changed to WSMU-FM in 1989. In June 2006, UMass Dartmouth sold the 91.1 frequency to the Educational Media Foundation, which relaunched it as WTKL; the programming that had been on WSMU-FM then moved to the new WUMD on 89.3. =Sale to Rhode Island Public Radio/The Public's Radio= On January 4, 2017, it was announced that UMass Dartmouth was selling WUMD to Rhode Island Public Radio for $1.5 million & $617,100 worth of underwriting for 10 years.

On paper, WNPN, like its predecessors, operated at relatively modest power for a full NPR member on the FM band. However, it now broadcast from the tallest active FM tower in Rhode Island, at 833 feet (only WLVO's auxiliary site in Johnston is taller). This added over 700,000 people in Rhode Island and the South Coast to its coverage area. As a result, it now provided at least secondary coverage to almost all of Rhode Island, and also brought a city-grade NPR signal to New Bedford and most of the South Coast for the first time ever.

Born in London, he spent most of his career in Rome and Sicily. Career The son of Cork immigrants, Fagan was born ca. 1761 in London. He arrived in Rome in 1781. Like other artists in Rome he became involved in dealing in antiquities, and, with the financial backing of some British patrons, carried out several archeological digs. In 1792 he excavated at Vigna San Sebastiano on Via Appia, financed by Corbet Corbet (whose portrait he painted that year). In 1793 the visiting British Prince Augustus Frederick secured permission from the Pope for Fagan to export antiquities. As an archaeologist he was involved in the excavations near Laurentum, which resulted in the discovery of the Venus, now at the Capitoline. As an artist, he made a career out of painting portraits, often for traveling British families. He was married twice, first to Anna Marie Ferri and then to Maria Ludovica Flajani a young Italian girl whom he married in 1801, just six months after his first wife's death. Fagan at Ricorso Following the Napoleonic occupation of Rome Fagan fled to Naples in 1797, but after a brief stay in Florence he returned to Rome and managed to despatch to Britain paintings by Claude and Moroni and other possessions to Naples. In 1807 he moved to Sicily. In 1809, following his daughter's marriage to William Baker, Fagan was made British Consul general in Sicily.Aspects of Irish Art. National Gallery of Ireland.

It was originally released theatrically as a segment in Make Mine Music. It was re-issued the following year accompanying a re-issue of Fantasia (as a short subject before the film), then released separately on home video in the 1990s. Background Prokofiev, while touring the West in 1938, visited Los Angeles and met Walt Disney. Prokofiev performed the piano version of Peter and the Wolf for \\"le papa de Mickey Mouse\\", as Prokofiev described him in a letter to his sons. Disney was impressed, and considered adding an animated version of Peter and the Wolf to Fantasia, which was to be released in 1940. Due to the war, these plans fell through, and it was not until 1946 that Disney released his version of Peter and the Wolf. It is not known if Prokofiev, by that point behind the Iron Curtain, was aware of this. Plot In Disney's animated adaptation of Prokofiev's masterpiece, in which every character is represented musically by a different instrument, a young Peter decides to go hunting for the wolf that's been prowling around the village. Along the way, he is joined by his friends Sasha the bird, Sonia the duck, and Ivan the cat. All the fun comes to end, however, when the wolf makes an appearance. Differences from the original This version makes several changes to the original story, for example: * During the character introduction, the animals are given names: \\"Sasha\\" the bird, \\"Sonia\\" the duck, and \\"Ivan\\" the cat. * As the cartoon begins, Peter and his friends already know there is a wolf nearby, and are preparing to catch him. * The hunters get names at a later point in the story: \\"Misha\\", \\"Yasha\\", and \\"Vladimir\\". * Peter day-dreams of hunting and catching the wolf and exits the garden carrying a wooden \\"pop-gun\\" rifle with the purpose of hunting the wolf down. * At the end, in a complete reversal of the original (and to make the story more child- friendly), it turns out that the duck, Sonia, has not been eaten by the wolf. (The wolf is shown chasing Sonia, who hides in an old tree's hollow trunk. The wolf attacks out of view, and returns in view with some of Sonia's feathers in his mouth and licking his jaws in visible satisfaction. Peter, Ivan, and Sasha assume Sonia has been eaten. After the wolf has been caught, Sasha is shown mourning Sonia. She comes out of the tree trunk at that point and they are happily reunited). In other media An audio recording of this version with expanded narration by Sterling Holloway was released on Disneyland Records (DQ-1242). Peter and the Wolf is featured on DVD in the Walt Disney Gold Classic Collection release of Make Mine Music and in Walt Disney's It's a Small World of Fun! Vol. 2. It is also featured on VHS in Belle's Tales of Friendship, the Disney version of Peter and the Wolf is featured and narrated by Belle instead of Sterling Holloway. This version was featured in House of Mouse. In the ABC television series Once Upon a Time, the character of Red Riding Hood has a boyfriend named Peter, a reference to the character in the 1946 Disney short. In the first season of the series, Peter is killed by the wolf (actually Red Riding Hood, who is revealed to be a werewolf).

Hodge was born in Tennessee and later moved to Shreveport, Louisiana, becoming a wealthy lawyer and prominent local politician. Elected colonel of the new 19th Louisiana in late 1861, Hodge resigned from the army after Shiloh due to ill health. Returning to politics, he won an unopposed election for a seat in the Confederate House of Representatives and briefly served in the Second Confederate Congress before his death in 1864.  Antebellum period  Hodge was born in Tennessee , according to census data. Little is known of his early life and education. By the 1850 census, he had become a lawyer and moved to Caddo Parish, Louisiana. At that time, he owned real estate valued at $1,000. Hodge achieved local prominence and served several terms in the state legislature. He was elected to the state senate in 1852 as a Whig from the district including Caddo, DeSoto, and Sabine Parishes. In 1855, Hodge was one of the organizers of the American Party (known as the Know Nothings) in Shreveport. He won election as a Know Nothing state representative from Caddo Parish in 1857. By the 1860 census, his assets had grown to a value of over $100,000, including four slaves, making him one of the wealthiest men in north Louisiana at the time and one of the most successful lawyers in the state. He was the owner of shops and the largest residence in Shreveport, and was invested in land and slaves, having married Caledonia Cash, the adopted daughter of a leading local planter, in 1852.Marriage Records, Red River Sankofa Project Two Mississippi and Red River steamboats, the B. L. Hodge and B. L. Hodge No. 2, built in 1857 and 1867, respectively, were named after him.  Secession and Civil War  As a former Whig who had become a Know Nothing, Hodge prioritized the preservation of the Union over states' rights, in opposition to Southern Democrats. In the 1860 election, he became a prominent supporter of moderate Constitutional Union Party, serving as an elector for it. Traveling to Washington, Hodge addressed Constitutional Unionists there in early August, denouncing secessionists as corrupt office-seekers and affirming the party ticket as the sole alternative to Republican Party. In the months leading up to the election he campaigned for the Constitutional Unionists in north Louisiana. Motivated by economic interests, a majority of Shreveport voters went for the Constitutional Union ticket in November. Planters in the rest of Caddo Parish carried it for the Southern Democrats, who gained a plurality of the state vote over the Constitutional Unionists. After Republican Abraham Lincoln was elected president, Hodge became a proponent of immediate disunion, standing for election to the state secession convention for the senatorial district of Caddo, DeSoto, Natchitoches, and Sabine Parishes. Hodge and DeSoto Parish planter and state senator Henry Marshall significantly outpolled their cooperationist opponents who favored delaying secession, and signed the state secession ordinance after it was pushed through by those advocating immediate secession on January 26, 1861. Hodge soon stood for election as a delegate to the Montgomery Constitutional Convention that became the Provisional Congress, but lost to Marshall by eight votes. Hodge joined the army on April 20, becoming third lieutenant of the Shreveport Grays infantry company, which was slated to join the 1st Louisiana Regulars but instead went to Lieutenant Colonel Charles Didier Dreux's 1st Louisiana Battalion, where it was designated Company D. He brought James Lewis, a free colored man, into service with him. After serving at Pensacola, Hodge and his unit were transferred to Virginia, one of the first Louisiana units to reach the state. The battalion served on picket duty in the Virginia Peninsula and on July 2 Hodge resigned his commission, returning to Louisiana with Lewis. A request by Major General Leonidas Polk to appoint Hodge as judge advocate general in his command was denied. Hodge unsuccessfully ran for a seat in the Confederate Senate in November and at Shreveport became captain of the Keachi Warriors. The latter became Company I of the 19th Louisiana Infantry Regiment, and Hodge was elected colonel of the regiment when it was organized on November 11. With Bragg's corps, Gibson's brigade was involved in the attack on Prentiss' division Hodge led the regiment in the 1862 Battle of Shiloh as part of Colonel Randall L. Gibson's brigade. About noon on the first day of the battle, April 6, the 19th Louisiana advanced into the Davis' wheat field against the Union center, and were struck by Union fire after reaching the log cabin in the middle of the field, their opponents obscured by the brush. Hodge advanced his men to seek shelter behind a fence on the north side of the field. In the brigade advance on Union positions that became known as the Hornet's Nest, he ordered a bayonet charge, which failed with the loss of a sixth of the regiment to fire from three Union regiments and their artillery. Gibson's brigade failed to break the Union line in several frontal assaults, with Hodge writing in his post-battle report that \\"it would have been madness to have kept my command there longer.\\" Exhausted, the brigade was sent to the rear by corps commander Major General Braxton Bragg. Hodge advocated for bringing up artillery and flanking the Union line at the Hornet's Nest. Bragg ignored this suggestion, but Hodge was vindicated by the surrender of the Hornet's Nest defenders hours later when the Confederates employed massed artillery and flank attacks. That night, Hodge camped his regiment to the right of Brigadier General Patton Anderson's brigade, separating it from the rest of Gibson's brigade. On the morning of April 7, Hodge attempted to rejoin Gibson's brigade but Brigadier General Jones Withers ordered him to turn over command of the 19th Louisiana to its lieutenant colonel and put him in command of a improvised brigade consisting of his regiment, the 25th Alabama and Crescent Regiments, and the 5th Company of the Washington Artillery. His ad hoc formation was positioned on the right of the army in support of Brigadier General James R. Chalmers' brigade in Davis' field. The guns of the Washington Artillery were temporarily overrun by Colonel William B. Hazen's brigade around 11:00, and the Louisianans charged forward to retake them, routing the Union troops. In the latter, Hodge was stunned by being thrown from his horse and had to be carried off the field. Hodge residence plaque Hodge resigned his commission on May 29, due to health problems, after a long period on sick leave, returning to Shreveport. His resignation was not accepted until July 15. In the election of November 1863 he won a seat representing the 5th district in the Confederate House of Representatives after running unopposed, replacing the anti-administration Marshall, who declined to run for re-election. On February 19, 1864, he was appointed presiding judge of the military court of the Trans-Mississippi Department, a position that carried the rank of colonel with it. Due to travel time, Hodge was not admitted to the first session of the Second Confederate Congress until May 25. He proposed no bills and rarely voted, advocating for higher taxes and protectionism. The session ended on June 14 and Hodge returned to Louisiana. His health continued to decline and he died near Shreveport, likely at the mansion of his wife's stepfather, on August 12. His seat was filled by Henry Gray in a special election. Hodge, described by a contemporary newspaper as \\"well known as one of the most brilliant men in North Louisiana,\\" was buried in an unmarked grave in Shreveport's Oakland Cemetery. Hodge and his wife had three sons, Benjamin Lewis, A.G., and Thomas Green, the last of which died in 1956 at the age of 92. Hodge loaned his residence to department commander Lieutenant General Edmund Kirby Smith when the Trans-Mississippi Department was headquartered in Shreveport. A plaque was dedicated to Hodges at the Oakland Cemetery in 1979.
