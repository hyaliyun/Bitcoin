It is closely related to the red-backed shrike (L. collurio) and isabelline shrike (L. isabellinus). The genus name, Lanius, is derived from the Latin word for \\"butcher\\", and some shrikes are also known as \\"butcher birds\\" because of their feeding habits. The specific cristatus is Latin for \\"crested\\", used in a broader sense than in English. The common English name \\"shrike\\" is from Old English scr√≠c, \\"shriek\\", referring to the shrill call. Like most other shrikes, it has a distinctive black \\"bandit-mask\\" through the eye and is found mainly in open scrub habitats, where it perches on the tops of thorny bushes in search of prey. Several populations of this widespread species form distinctive subspecies which breed in temperate Asia and migrate to their winter quarters in tropical Asia. They are sometimes found as vagrants in Europe and North America. Description Immature bird, Kolkata, India This shrike is mainly brown on the upper parts and the tail is rounded. The black mask can be paler in winter and has a white brow over it. The underside is creamy with rufous flanks and belly. The wings are brown and lack any white \\"mirror\\" patches. Females tend to have fine scalloping on the underside and the mask is dark brown and not as well marked as in the male. The distinction is not easy to use in the field but has been tested with breeding birds in Japan where the female can be identified from the presence of a brood patch. The use of multiple measurements allows discrimination of the sex of about 90% of the birds. Subspecies lucionensis has a grey crown shading into the brown upperparts and the rump appears more rufous than the rest of the upper back. The tail is more brownish and not as reddish as in the red-backed shrike. Younger birds of lucionensis have a brown crown and lack the grey on the head. Subspecies superciliosus has a broad white supercilium and a richer reddish crown. The tail is redder and tipped in white. A number of confusing forms are known from central Asia where the populations of cristatus, isabellinus and collurio overlap. The taxonomy has been in a state of flux and some forms such as phoenicuroides formerly considered as subspecies of L. cristatus have been moved to the species L. isabellinus. Subspecies lucionensis has been recorded interbreeding with superciliosus in Ishikawa, Japan while superciliosus has interbred with Lanius tigrinus in central Japan. Distribution Eggs, Collection Museum Wiesbaden L. cristatus superciliosus specimen, Collection Naturalis Biodiversity Center The nominate form breeds in northern Asia from Mongolia to Siberia and winters in South Asia, Myanmar and the Malay Peninsula. The race confusus described from the same region is not well marked but is said to have a wider white brow and paler upperparts and is sometimes included within the nominate population. Subspecies superciliosus (sometimes called the Japanese shrike) breeds on the islands of Sakhalin, Kuril and Japan and winters in Hainan, Sumatra, Java, and the Sundas. Subspecies lucionensis, sometimes known as the Philippine shrike (local names: tarat or pakis-kis), breeds in Korea and eastern China wintering mainly in Taiwan and the Philippines but also on the Andaman Islands and in peninsular India. Stuart Baker suggested that the species may breed in the Cachar Hills of Assam but the idea was questioned by Claud Buchanan Ticehurst. This species is rare in Europe and vagrants have been recorded in the United States and Canada. Behaviour and ecology Lanius cristatus lucionensis, the Philippine shrike; note the grey crown and white throat contrasting with the rufescent underside. Kolkata, India The brown shrike is a migratory species and ringing studies show that they have high fidelity to their wintering sites, often returning to the same locations each winter. They begin establishing wintering territories shortly after arrival and their loud chattering or rattling calls are distinctive. Birds that arrive early and establish territories appear to have an advantage over those that arrive later in the winter areas. The timing of their migration is very regular with their arrival in winter to India in August and September and departure in April. During their winter period, they go through a premigratory moult. Their song in the winter quarters is faint and somewhat resembles the call of the rosy starling and often includes mimicry of other birds. The beak remains closed when singing and only throat pulsations are visible although the bird moves its tail up and down while singing. The breeding season is late May or June and the breeding habitat includes the taiga, forest to semi-desert where they build a nest in a tree or bush, laying two to six eggs. They feed mainly on insects, especially Lepidoptera. Like other shrikes, they impale prey on thorns. Small birds and lizards are also sometimes preyed upon. A white-eye (Zosterops) has been recorded in its larder. They typically look out for prey from a perch and fly down towards the ground to capture them.

Colloquially, Russian-speakers may refer to Naval Infantrymen using the abbreviation –º–æ—Ä–ø–µ—Ö–∏ (morpekhi (plural), singular form: –º–æ—Ä–ø–µ—Ö (morpekh)). The first Russian naval infantry force formed in 1705, and since that time it has fought in the Napoleonic Wars, the Crimean War (1853-1856), the Russo-Japanese War (1904-1905), the First World War (1914-1918) and the Second World War (1939-1945). Under Admiral Gorshkov (Soviet Navy Commander- in-Chief from 1956 to 1985), the Soviet Navy expanded the reach of the Naval Infantry and deployed it worldwide on numerous occasions. Since 2009 Lieutenant General (NI) (Lieutenant General (NI) since 2014) has commanded the Naval Infantry in his capacity as the Deputy Commander for Coastal Troops/Commandant of the Coastal Troops of the Russian Navy. The Naval Infantry, alongside the Coastal Defense Missile Artillery Forces, form part of a larger institution‚Äîthe Coastal Troops of the Russian Navy (, Beregovye voyska VMF Rossii). History Little is known about the Russian Naval infantrymen during the Imperial era of Russia because many of the units formed consisted of supernumerary ship crews of destroyed or immobilised Russian warships.http://www.historyofwar.org/articles/weapons_russiannavallong.html#rn1 The history of the Russian Navy could be traced back to the 16th century with Ivan the Terrible with the formation of his special team of Streltsy \\"sea soldiers\\" as part of his crew of flotilla ships. The official history of the Naval Infantry could be traced back to the creation of the Russian ship Oryol (lit., Eagle), which launched in 1668 & sailed with a crew of 23 sailors & 35 soldiers, with the soldiers duties of boarding & capturing enemy ships & providing sentinel service under the command of Ivan Domozhirov.–ò—Å—Ç–æ—Ä–∏—è –º–æ—Ä—Å–∫–æ–π –ø–µ—Ö–æ—Ç—ã –†–æ—Å—Å–∏–π—Å–∫–æ–π –ò–º–ø–µ—Ä–∏–∏ –¥–æ 1917 –≥–æ–¥–∞. During the Azov campaign of the Russo-Turkish War, under Peter the Great, the soldiers in these units; many of whom were recruited by the Preobrazhensky & the Semyonovsky Regiments of the later-to-become Imperial Guards, were shown to be particularly effective in carrying out those duties. Those soldiers would later on form the Russian Navy's very first infantry regiment consisting of 4300 men.https://voenpro.ru/infolenta/morskaya-pehota-rossii The first admiral of the regiment was appointed by no less than Tsar Peter I himself, General Admiral Fyodor Golovin, who later gave the respective order to Vice Admiral Cornelius Kruys on November 16, 1705 marking the glorious years following for the Russian Naval Infantry.http://rusnavy.com/history/branches/bv/300years.htm?print=Y =Official formation= In November 16 (27), 1705, following a decree of Peter I, the first regiment \\"of naval equipage\\" () (or in other words, equipped and supplied by the Russian Imperial Navy) was formed for boarding and landing operations, on the ships of the Baltic Fleet. The regiment had 1200 men (two battalions of five companies; 45 officers, & 70 non-commissioned officers), and from this pioneer regiment began the long history of Naval Infantry within Russia. =Great Northern War= In 1714, the regiment won a victory against the Swedes during the Battle of Gangut. However, after the war, a review of the Regiment's performance during the war concluded that the regimental organization of the unit did not work with the organizational structure of the Navy's fleet and did not allow it to be correctly utilized in combat conditions. As a result, the naval regiment was disbanded, and in replace of it, five naval battalions of consisting of men drawn from the army was created in 1712-1714 & attached to the fleet: :\\"Vice Admiral Battalion\\" - for service in the vanguard squadrons on the ships of the squadron's avant- garde; :\\"Admiral's Battalion\\" - for service on ships of the squadron center; :\\"Rear Admiral Battalion\\" - for service on the ships of the rear guard of the squadron; :\\"Galler Battalion\\" - for service on combat ships of the Galere fleet; :\\"Admiralty Battalion\\" - for guard duty and other tasks.https://y4astkoviu.livejournal.com/1006.html =Russo-Turkish Wars= The Russian naval infantry were involved in a series of victories against the Ottoman Empire including the rout of the Turkish Navy at the Battle for Cesme Harbor in 1770, and the taking of Izmail Fortress on the Danube, in 1790. =Napoleonic War= During the prelude to the war, in 1799 the Russian naval infantry took the French fortress at Corfu after a four-month siege. In 1806, a Russian landing force took Naples by storm and entered the Papal States. During the War of the Sixth Coalition, the Russian naval infantry distinguished itself against La Grande Arm√©e at the Battle of Borodino (1812), Battle of Kulm (1813) and the Siege of Danzig. =Crimean War= By 1813, significant parts of the naval infantry were transferred to the Army & subsequently lost naval connections. For almost 100 years, there were no large infantry units in the Russian Navy. Nevertheless, in 1854‚Äì1855, during the Siege of Sevastopol against British, French and Turkish troops, there were renewed calls for revival of the military's Naval Infantry units. 17 separate sea battalions were formed and they participated in the defense of Sevastopol. =Early 20th Century= Russo-Japanese War During 1904 Russo-Japanese War, the naval infantry defended Port Arthur against Japanese forces. Personnels were recruited from regular sailors & naval crews to make up the numbers. Seven separate naval rifle battalions, a separate landing squad of sailors, three separate sea rifle companies and several machine-gun teams were formed. World War I The question of the formation of permanent Naval Infantry Units were raised only in 1910 and in 1911, projects were underway under the Chief Naval Staff for the development of permanent infantry units in the main naval bases of the country: an infantry regiment under the Baltic Fleet, an infantry battalion in the Black Sea Fleet and the Vladivostok Battalion for the Pacific Fleet. In August 1914, two separate battalions from the personnel of the Guards Fleet Crew and one battalion of personnel from the 1st Baltic Fleet Crew were created in Kronstadt. In March 1915, a separate naval battalion of the 2nd Baltic Fleet Crew was transformed into the Marine Regiment of Special Purpose. It included a mine company, a machine-gun team, a communications team, regimental artillery, a technical workshop, a convoy, and individual commands of the steamer Ivan-town and boats. At the end of 1916 and the beginning of 1917, the first two divisions of marines were formed; the Baltic Division and Black Sea Division. The naval infantry was deployed to the Baltic to defend the homeland against German attack as well as the Caspian Sea for operations against Ottoman forces. = Post-Russian Revolutions and the Russian Civil War= These naval infantrymen, who served under the Navy of the Imperial State, would later on form the core of the naval infantry service of the young Soviet Navy in 1918, which distinguished itself during the long Russian Civil War (1918-1922). Many of their fellow servicemen, through, supported the White movement and distinguished themselves as part of anti- Soviet military operations during those years. =Soviet era= World War II Great Patriotic War During World War II about 350,000 Soviet Navy sailors fought on land operations. At the beginning of the war, the navy had only one naval infantry brigade in the Baltic Fleet, but began forming and training other battalions. These eventually were: * six naval infantry regiments, comprising two 650 man battalions each, * 40 naval infantry brigades of 5‚Äì10 battalions, formed from surplus ships' crews. Five brigades were awarded Gvardy (Guards) status, * 1 Division (the 55th) - former Red Army unit, * plus numerous smaller units Many of the new units were raised as part of the Black Sea, Pacific and Northern Fleets. The military situation demanded the deployment of large numbers of naval infantry on land, so the Naval Infantry contributed to the defense of Odessa, Moscow, Leningrad, Sevastopol, Stalingrad, Novorossiysk and Kerch. The Naval Infantry conducted over 114 landings, most of which were carried out by platoons and companies. In general, however, Naval Infantry served as regular infantry, without any amphibious training. They conducted four major operations: two during the Battle of the Kerch Peninsula, one during the Caucasus Campaign and one as part of the Landing at Moonsund, in the Baltic. During the war, five brigades and two battalions of naval infantry were awarded Guards status. Nine brigades and six battalions were awarded decorations, and many were given honorary titles. The title Hero of the Soviet Union was bestowed on 122 servicemen of naval infantry units. The Soviet experience in amphibious warfare in World War II contributed to the development of Soviet operational art in combined arms operations. Many members of the Naval Infantry were parachute trained; they conducted more drops and successful parachute operations than the VDV. The Naval Infantry was disbanded in 1947, with some units being transferred to the Coastal Defence Force. Cold War Soviet marines in 1985 Soviet marines during a demonstration in 1990 In 1961, the Naval Infantry was re-formed and became a combat arm of the Soviet Navy. Each Fleet was assigned a Naval Infantry unit of regiment (and later brigade) size. The Naval Infantry received amphibious versions of standard armoured fighting vehicles, including tanks used by the Soviet Army. By 1989, the Naval Infantry numbered 18,000 troops, organised into the 55th Naval Infantry Division at Vladivostok and at least four independent brigades: the 61st Kirkenneskaya Brigade at Pechenga (Northern Fleet), 175th at Tumannyy in the North, 336th Guards Naval Infantry Brigade at Baltiysk (Baltic Fleet), and 810th at Sevastopol (Black Sea Fleet). By the end of the Cold War, the Soviet Navy had over eighty landing ships, as well as two Ivan Rogov-class landing ships. The latter could transport one infantry battalion with 40 armoured vehicles and their landing craft. (One of the Rogov ships has since been retired.) At 75 units, the Soviet Union had the world's largest inventory of combat air-cushion assault craft. In addition, many of the 2,500 vessels of the Soviet merchant fleet (Morflot) could off- load weapons and supplies during amphibious landings. On November 18, 1990, on the eve of the Paris Summit where the Conventional Armed Forces in Europe (CFE) Treaty and the Vienna Document on Confidence and Security-Building Measures (CSBMs) were signed, Soviet data were presented under the so-called initial data exchange. This showed a rather sudden emergence of three so- called coastal defence divisions (including the 3rd at Klaipƒóda in the Baltic Military District, the 126th in the Odessa Military District and seemingly the 77th Guards Motor Rifle Division with the Northern Fleet), along with three artillery brigades/regiments, subordinate to the Soviet Navy, which had previously been unknown as such to NATO.IISS Military Balance 1991‚Äì1992, p.30‚Äì31 Much of the equipment, which was commonly understood to be treaty limited (TLE) was declared to be part of the naval infantry. The Soviet argument was that the CFE excluded all naval forces, including its permanently land-based components. The Soviet Government eventually became convinced that its position could not be maintained. A proclamation of the Soviet government on July 14, 1991, which was later adopted by its successor states, provided that all \\"treaty-limited equipment\\" (tanks, artillery and armoured vehicles) assigned to naval infantry or coastal defence forces, would count against the total treaty entitlement. =Russian Federation= A Russian marine during an exercise in 2003 Russian naval infantry marching in the 2008 Victory Day Parade Russian Pacific Fleet paratroopers in training, 2009 Marines conducting anti-piracy tasks for guarding convoy ships in the Gulf of Aden and the Horn of Africa Marines provide protection for the ships of the 5th Operational Squadron off the coast of Syria. The Naval Infantry of the Russian Navy includes the 55th Naval Infantry Division of the Russian Pacific Fleet (), the independent brigades of the Northern (61st Brigade at Sputnik, Murmansk Oblast) and Baltic Fleets and of the Caspian Military Flotilla, and the independent regiment of the Black Sea Fleet. In 1994, Exercise \\"Cooperation from the Sea\\" was conducted, in and around Vladivostok, with the U.S. III Marine Expeditionary Force, to foster a closer relationship between the Russian Naval Infantry and the United States Marine Corps. U.S. Marines and Russian naval infantrymen conducted their first exercise on U.S. soil the following year, in Hawaii. \\"Cooperation From the Sea 1995\\" was a maritime disaster relief exercise, which included cross training and personnel exchanges, and culminated in a combined U.S. and Russian amphibious landing. The purpose of the exercise was to improve interoperability, cooperation and understanding between U.S. and Russian personnel. In 1998, the 22nd Motor Rifle Division, Far East Military District, at Petropavlovsk-Kamchatka, was transferred to the Pacific Fleet. In 2000 the division became the 40th Independent Motor Rifle Brigade, and on 1 September 2007 the 40th Naval Infantry Brigade (40 –æ—Ç–¥. –ö—Ä–∞—Å–Ω–æ–¥–∞—Ä—Å–∫–æ-–•–∞—Ä–±–∏–Ω—Å–∫–∞—è –¥–≤–∞–∂–¥—ã –ö—Ä–∞—Å–Ω–æ–∑–Ω–∞–º–µ–Ω–Ω–∞—è –±—Ä–∏–≥–∞–¥–∞ –º–æ—Ä—Å–∫–æ–π –ø–µ—Ö–æ—Ç—ã).

On the night of 19 to 20 September 2015, Russian Naval Infantry engaged in a fight with militants of the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) near the city of Latakia. The militants tried to mount an attack on the airbase there, however, they were ambushed by the Naval Infantry. As a result of the clash, three militants were killed, two were captured, and the rest retreated. Before dawn of 24 September 2015, Russian Naval Infantry went into battle for the first time since their deployment to Syria, Debka file's military and intelligence sources reveal. The 810th Naval Infantry Brigade fought with Syrian Army and Hezbollah special forces in an attack on ISIL forces at the Kweiris air base, east of Aleppo. In November 2015, a Russian Naval Infantryman was killed during an operation to rescue the crew of a Russian Sukhoi Su-24M bomber aircraft that was shot down by the Turkish Air Force near the Syria‚ÄìTurkey border. In March 2016, the 61st Naval Infantry Brigade conducted operations in which it aided the Syrian Army's liberation of the Syrian city of Palmyra. The 61st also participated in the storming of the city. Sources consider it one of the best trained and most combat experienced units of the Russian forces. In mid-May 2016, Russian Naval Infantry helped Syrian forces recapture the initiative in east Homs, while also recovering several points near the Al-Sha‚Äôar Gas Fields and T-4 Military Airport. In September 2016, it was reported that Russian Naval Infantry were conducting operations on Aleppo's Castillo Highway.

A Naval Infantry Regiment consists of roughly 2,000 personnel and is equipped with the PT-76 and BRDM-2, consists of 1 Tank Battalion and 3 naval infantry battalions, one motorised with BTR-60-series amphibious vehicles. brigades are somewhat larger. Although, sizes vary depending on mission and specializations.https://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/russia/mp- toe.htm Naval Infantry Battalions comprise the backbone of the naval infantry fighting force. The battalion is made up of three naval infantry companies, a mortar platoon, an antitank platoon, and supporting supply and maintenance, medical, and communications units. In all, the battalion numbers about 400 men. This unit, reinforced, constitutes the basic amphibious attack force in the assault landing-the battalion assault force (BAF). At least one infantry battalion of each regiment or brigade is parachute trained, while all of the remaining infantry battalions are trained to be able to carry out air assault missions. Equipment A Soviet naval infantryman stands with his arm rested on his PT-76 amphibious light tank in August 1989. Note the large (opened) oval shaped double hatch, the searchlight on the right hand side of the top of the turret and a radio antenna on the left hand-side of the turret. The Russian Naval Infantry have been gradually phasing out PT-76 amphibious tanks, and started to receive a number of T-80s and upgraded BMP-2Ms.http://eng.mil.ru/en/news_page/country/more.htm?id=12153736@egNewshttps://sputniknews.com/military/201909101076765604-ten-t-80-tanks- deployed-to-russian-pacific-fleet-to-bolster-marine- forces/https://www.armyrecognition.com/weapons_defence_industry_military_technology_uk/russian_upgraded_bmp-2m_ifvs_deployed_in_kamchatka.html A full-strength Naval Infantry Brigade may have up to 70-80 Tanks. The APCs used by the Naval Infantry are either wheeled BTR-80s (in Assault Landing Battalions) or tracked MT-LBs (in Marine Battalions). While Naval Infantry units were supposed to receive BMP-3 IFVs, BMMP (bojevaya mashina morskoj pekhoti) fitted with the turret of the BMP-2, few have been delivered, and it is far from certain such re-arming will take place. BMP-3s may equip one company per Marine battalion. According to Defense Ministry statement published by RIA Novosti (November 27, 2009), \\"All units of Russia's naval infantry will be fully equipped with advanced weaponry by 2015.\\" Included in this upgrade would be T-90 tanks, BMP-3 IFVs, 2S31 120mm mortar/artillery tracks, wheeled BTR-82A armored personnel carriers, air defense equipment and small arms.Russia's naval infantry to be totally re-armed by 2015 All Naval Infantry units were equipped with Ratnik infantry combat gear and all Northern Fleet naval infantry units were equipped with BTR-82A APCs as of November 2016.

Propelled by diesel engines, this ship is relatively small, displacing about 4,500 tons. In 1978, the Soviets launched a new amphibious ship, the Ivan Rogov. The advent of the Ivan Rogov was taken in the West as an indication that the Soviet Navy was planning to strengthen the power projection mission of Naval Infantry. Twice the size of earlier ships, it can launch amphibious vehicles from its open bow doors. It also carries helicopters. Among the various small assault landing vehicles to launch from the bow are hovercraft, such as the Aist, which can carry the naval infantry ashore at speeds of fifty knots.

However, when its terms become very small, the arc's radius decreases rapidly from 3 to 1 then increases from 1 to 2. The Lucas numbers or Lucas series are an integer sequence named after the mathematician Fran√ßois √âdouard Anatole Lucas (1842-91), who studied both that sequence and the closely related Fibonacci numbers. Lucas numbers and Fibonacci numbers form complementary instances of Lucas sequences. The Lucas sequence has the same recursive relationship as the Fibonacci sequence, where each term is the sum of the two previous terms, but with different starting values. This produces a sequence where the ratios of successive terms approach the golden ratio, and in fact the terms themselves are roundings of integer powers of the golden ratio. The sequence also has a variety of relationships with the Fibonacci numbers, like the fact that adding any two Fibonacci numbers two terms apart in the Fibonacci sequence results in the Lucas number in between. The first few Lucas numbers are : 2, 1, 3, 4, 7, 11, 18, 29, 47, 76, 123, ....  Definition  Similar to the Fibonacci numbers, each Lucas number is defined to be the sum of its two immediate previous terms, thereby forming a Fibonacci integer sequence. The first two Lucas numbers are L0 = 2 and L1 = 1 as opposed to the first two Fibonacci numbers F0 = 0 and F1 = 1.A New Kind of Science Though closely related in definition, Lucas and Fibonacci numbers exhibit distinct properties. The Lucas numbers may thus be defined as follows: : L_n := \\\\begin{cases} 2 & \\\\text{if } n = 0; \\\\\\\\\\\\ 1 & \\\\text{if } n = 1; \\\\\\\\\\\\ L_{n-1}+L_{n-2} & \\\\text{if } n > 1. \\\\end{cases} (where n belongs to the natural numbers) The sequence of the first twelve Lucas numbers is: :2,\\\\;1,\\\\;3,\\\\;4,\\\\;7,\\\\;11,\\\\;18,\\\\;29,\\\\;47,\\\\;76,\\\\;123,\\\\;199,\\\\; \\\\ldots\\\\;. All Fibonacci-like integer sequences appear in shifted form as a row of the Wythoff array; the Fibonacci sequence itself is the first row and the Lucas sequence is the second row. Also like all Fibonacci-like integer sequences, the ratio between two consecutive Lucas numbers converges to the golden ratio. Extension to negative integers Using Ln‚àí2 = Ln ‚àí Ln‚àí1, one can extend the Lucas numbers to negative integers to obtain a doubly infinite sequence: :..., ‚àí11, 7, ‚àí4, 3, ‚àí1, 2, 1, 3, 4, 7, 11, ... (terms L_n for -5\\\\leq{}n\\\\leq5 are shown). The formula for terms with negative indices in this sequence is : L_{-n}=(-1)^nL_n.\\\\\\\\! Relationship to Fibonacci numbers The first identity expressed visually The Lucas numbers are related to the Fibonacci numbers by many identities. Among these are the following: * L_n = F_{n-1}+F_{n+1}=F_n+2F_{n-1} = F_{n+2}-F_{n-2} * L_{m+n} = L_{m+1}F_{n}+L_mF_{n-1} * L_n^2 = 5 F_n^2 + 4 (-1)^n, and thus as n\\\\, approaches +‚àû, the ratio \\\\frac{L_n}{F_n} approaches \\\\sqrt{5}. * F_{2n} = L_n F_n * F_{n+k} + (-1)^k F_{n-k} = L_k F_n * L_{n+k} - (-1)^k L_{n-k} = 5 F_n F_k; in particular, F_n = {L_{n-1}+L_{n+1} \\\\over 5} Their closed formula is given as: :L_n = \\\\varphi^n + (1-\\\\varphi)^{n} = \\\\varphi^n + (- \\\\varphi)^{-n}=\\\\left({ 1+ \\\\sqrt{5} \\\\over 2}\\\\right)^n + \\\\left({ 1- \\\\sqrt{5} \\\\over 2}\\\\right)^n\\\\, , where \\\\varphi is the golden ratio. Alternatively, as for n>1 the magnitude of the term (-\\\\varphi)^{-n} is less than 1/2, L_n is the closest integer to \\\\varphi^n or, equivalently, the integer part of \\\\varphi^n+1/2, also written as \\\\lfloor \\\\varphi^n+1/2 \\\\rfloor. Combining the above with Binet's formula, :F_n = \\\\frac{\\\\varphi^n - (1-\\\\varphi)^{n}}{\\\\sqrt{5}}\\\\, , a formula for \\\\varphi^n is obtained: :\\\\varphi^n = {{L_n + F_n \\\\sqrt{5}} \\\\over 2}\\\\, . Congruence relations If Fn ‚â• 5 is a Fibonacci number then no Lucas number is divisible by Fn. Ln is congruent to 1 mod n if n is prime, but some composite values of n also have this property. These are the Fibonacci pseudoprimes. Ln \\\\- Ln-4 is congruent to 0 mod 5.  Lucas primes  A Lucas prime is a Lucas number that is prime. The first few Lucas primes are :2, 3, 7, 11, 29, 47, 199, 521, 2207, 3571, 9349, 3010349, 54018521, 370248451, 6643838879, ... . The indices of these primes are (for example, L4 = 7) :0, 2, 4, 5, 7, 8, 11, 13, 16, 17, 19, 31, 37, 41, 47, 53, 61, 71, 79, 113, 313, 353, 503, 613, 617, 863, 1097, 1361, 4787, 4793, 5851, 7741, 8467, ... . If Ln is prime then n is 0, prime, or a power of 2.Chris Caldwell, \\"The Prime Glossary: Lucas prime\\" from The Prime Pages. L2m is prime for m = 1, 2, 3, and 4 and no other known values of m. Generating series Let :\\\\Phi(x) = 2 + x + 3x^2 + 4x^3 + \\\\cdots = \\\\sum_{n = 0}^\\\\infty L_nx^n be the generating series of the Lucas numbers. By a direct computation, :\\\\begin{align} \\\\Phi(x) &= L_0 + L_1x + \\\\sum_{n = 2}^\\\\infty L_nx^n \\\\\\\\\\\\ &= 2 + x + \\\\sum_{n = 2}^\\\\infty (L_{n - 1} + L_{n - 2})x^n \\\\\\\\\\\\ &= 2 + x + \\\\sum_{n = 1}^\\\\infty L_nx^{n + 1} + \\\\sum_{n = 0}^\\\\infty L_nx^{n + 2} \\\\\\\\\\\\ &= 2 + x + x(\\\\Phi(x) - 2) + x^2 \\\\Phi(x) \\\\end{align} which can be rearranged as :\\\\Phi(x) = \\\\frac{2 - x}{1 - x - x^2}. The partial fraction decomposition is given by :\\\\Phi(x) = \\\\frac{1}{1 - \\\\varphi x} + \\\\frac{1}{1 - \\\\phi x} where \\\\varphi = \\\\frac{1 + \\\\sqrt{5}}{2} is the golden ratio and \\\\phi = \\\\frac{1 - \\\\sqrt{5}}{2} is its conjugate. Lucas polynomials In the same way as Fibonacci polynomials are derived from the Fibonacci numbers, the Lucas polynomials Ln(x) are a polynomial sequence derived from the Lucas numbers.

Banks The Cluj-Napoca regional headquarters of the Banca Rom√¢nƒÉ pentru Dezvoltare (BRD) (Romanian Bank for Development) was completed in 1997 after 4 years of work. It is the tallest building in Cluj-Napoca, 50 m or 164 feet. Its 12 stories house offices for the bank and for divisions of several other companies, including insurance and oil companies. City Business Center known as \\"ClƒÉdirea Biscuite\\" Another architecturally interesting building is the unfinished headquarters of the Banca Agricole (Agricultural Bank), held in the custody of the city due to the failure of that bank and its subsequent purchase by the Reiffeisen Bank. Work ceased in 2000; all that was finished was the exterior, built by the Abatech firm. The city government proposed that the building be completed and transformed into the Casa Europei (\\"House of Europe\\"), but funds were not obtained to complete work. In 2006, it was announced that the building will completed as a City Business Center, and work resumed. Today the building is functional and bears the nickname \\"ClƒÉdirea biscuite\\". Another building in similar straits is the more recently started behind Palatul Telefoanelor (Telephone Palace; a building of the same name exists in Bucharest), built by Romtelecom (the national, public phone company), who could not afford to finish the building and auctioned it off. It was bought by Banca Transilvania for 3 million euros. The financial institution announced it will be used as a banking caf√© (Romanian: cafenea bancarƒÉ), the first of its kind in Cluj (however, since the announcement a rival bank, Banc Post, opened such a caf√©). Other banks that have constructed modern buildings in Cluj-Napoca include Banca Transilvania, Banca ComercialƒÉ Rom√¢nƒÉ, Banc Post, Banca ≈¢iriac, ABN Amro Bank, and UniCredit.  Other buildings  In the more recent years real estate developers have built more buildings as the city experienced economic growth. Iulius Mall opened a big commercial center with a business tower on top in 2007. In 2014 United Business Center was built near Iulius Mall and in Marasti neighborhood a large office complex started being built with the name simply \\"The Office\\" which had its phase one completed in 2014 and the entire complex is expected to be finished in 2016. Many residential buildings started to appear mainly on the city outskirts and in Flore»ôti. The most notable area where this is taking place is in BunƒÉ Ziua neighborhood. Government buildings Octavian Goga Library Besides banks, Cluj-Napoca features several modern buildings constructed under the aegis of the local government. The most recent is the Octavian Goga Library Building, which also houses information centers for the European Union and NATO. This building was started in 2000 and completed in 2003. Other post-Communist-era government buildings include the Avram Iancu Firehouse, Cluj-Napoca International Airport, and the Cluj-Napoca branch of DistriGaz.

The Gateway Handbook was a very small and lightweight subnotebook originally introduced by Gateway Computers in 1992. It quickly achieved critical acclaim and a cult-like following, especially in Japan. It was designed by IQV and Tottori Sanyo and manufactured by Tottori Sanyo in Japan. The lead engineer on the product was Howard Fullmer and other significant contributors included Bob Burnett and Rick Murayama. The product was only wide, deep, and high, and weighed less than .Gateway Support - 486DX2-40/DX2-50 HandBook 486 Specifications While it used a Chips and Technologies 8680 microprocessor, it was marketed as having 286-level performance.groups.google.comGateway Support - HandBook 286 Specifications The C&T; chip set included hardware emulation of the Intel 80186 processor and the Handbook used a special feature of the chip set called SuperSet whereby 80286 instructions were trapped and then emulated in software. This same feature was used to emulate the 8051 keyboard controller, serial port and numerous other I/O functions. Intel worked closely with IQV to include similar capabilities in the SL chip sets which were introduced in the mid-90s. The Handbook had 640 KB of RAM, a 20 MB hard drive, and a monochrome blue-white CGA-compatible display. The unit could be powered by a rechargeable NiMH battery or six AA batteries in a special battery pack. The rechargeable batteries were unusual in that they are able to be charged without actually being in the laptop. A floppy disk was attached through a proprietary parallel port connector. A tremendous engineering effort went into the design of the HandBook's keyboard. It featured 17.8 mm center-to center key spacing and 2 mm travel for a firm feel. After the success of the original Gateway Handbook, Gateway came out with a 486 model. The Handbook 486 (as it was called) was originally available as two models: A 486SX/25 and a 486DX/40 model. Gateway later on came out with Handbook 486 models utilizing a 486SX/33 or 486DX/50 processor. All of these handbooks used a grayscale 640x480 VGA display. Because of the small size of the unit, the display was distorted ‚Äî what appear as circles on other displays come out as ovals on the Handbook 486. The built-in hard disk for the Handbook 486 was usually 120 MB in size. The Handbook 486 was produced between 1993 and 1995.groups.google.comgroups.google.comgroups.google.cl The Handbook 486 had 4 MB of built-in RAM, which can be expanded to 20 MB. As of 2005, it is still possible to buy memory for the Handbook 486, although one should test the memory with memtest since memory for older computers is more likely to be defective. It is possible to install Linux or OpenBSD on these computers; the Handbook 486 is probably the earliest Linux-compatible subnotebook released. It is even possible to run the X Window System after the memory is expanded. The Handbook 486 has a PCMCIA II interface. While Modern Cardbus cards do not work with this interface, most older PCMCIA II cards (as long as they use no more than 250 mA of power)3C589 - Gateway Handbook work fine. The Handbook 486 also has a pointing device similar to the IBM trackpoint located on the right hand side of the keyboard just above the enter key. The Gateway Handbook remains one of the smallest laptops ever produced and was a precursor to Netbooks such as the Asus Eee PC, the Dell Inspiron Mini Series, and the Acer Aspire One. The Acer Aspire One is about the same size as the Handbook, and exists in a Gateway-branded form as the Gateway LT1004u.

He captained the national team, the All Blacks 14 times playing a total of 25 games and 12 tests. Blackadder captained the Crusaders to three Super Rugby titles during his time with the franchise while also winning two NPC titles with Canterbury. Blackadder began his career as a blindside flanker but was transformed into a lock in 1998.  Early years  Blackadder was born in Rangiora, New Zealand, where he grew up working on his grandfathers farm. Blackadder was introduced into rugby by his father and uncles but left Rangiora College early without making the 1st XV. After leaving school, Blackadder took up a welding apprenticeship which moved him north to Collingwood where he left his mark with the Nelson Bays age-group selectors before being eventually selected for the New Zealand Under 19 tour of Australia. Blackadder left his welding apprenticeship to return to the farm where he worked for his future father-in- law, Brian McKay. Blackadder and McKay's daughter married and returned to Rangiora before working as a security guard and buying a courier. Playing career Blackadder made his senior representative debut for Nelson Bays against Marlborough in 1990. = NPC = Blackadder made his debut for Canterbury in 1991 when he returned to the province with his wife. In 1997 Blackadder led Canterbury to its first NPC title in 14 years when they defeated Counties Manukau 44‚Äì13 in the final. Blackadder also won the Ranfurly Shield on several occasions including defeating Waikato in 1994 while he was also present when Canterbury ended Waikato's three-year stranglehold on the shield in 2000. Blackadder played 126 games for Canterbury over his 11 years for the province. His final game for Canterbury was the 2001 NPC final against Otago which Canterbury won 30‚Äì19. = Super Rugby = Blackadder was part of the inaugural Crusaders team in 1996 and would go onto lead the side to its first Super Rugby title in 1998 after they defeated the Blues in the final 20‚Äì13. Blackadder would go onto lift the trophy again the following year in 1999 and again in 2000 as the Crusaders became the most successful franchise in Super Rugby history. = International debut = Blackadder played at the inaugural Rugby World Cup Sevens in 1993 after he was called in to the side as an injury replacement for Marc Ellis. Blackadder was first selected for the All Blacks in 1995 and made his test debut against England at Dunedin on 20 June 1998. Blackadder spent several years outside the team including missing the 1999 Rugby World Cup which New Zealand lost to France in the semi-finals which resulted in coach John Hart resigning from the side. Following Harts departure, Wayne Smith was appointed head coach of the All Blacks and promptly named Blackadder captain succeeding Taine Randell. The decision was met with fanfare by some who liked Blackadders simple uncomplicated approach. However, his locking ability and subsequently position leading the All Blacks was often under the microscope although All Blacks great Jonah Lomu stated that he was one of the finest captains he ever played under. Following one season captaining the All Blacks, Blackadder was replaced by hooker Anton Oliver as he failed to make the 30-man squad in the lead up to the Tri-Nations before departing for Scotland. = Scotland = Believing in need for a chance in scenery Blackadder departed New Zealand at the end of 2001 joining Scottish side Edinburgh Gunners. Blackadder would eventually move into a coaching role with the side. Coaching career Blackadder was first named as assistant forwards coach of Scotland's first foreign head coach Matt Williams, and became the forwards coach of the Edinburgh Gunners under Frank Hadden before Hadden replaced Williams and Blackadder was named as Edinburgh's head coach for the remainder of the 2005 season. Blackadder, who made a significant impact both playing and coaching in Edinburgh and Scotland confirmed his departure from Edinburgh to return to New Zealand in 2006. = Tasman = On return to New Zealand, Blackadder took up a role as the Director of Rugby for the Tasman Rugby Union as Nelson Bays and Marlborough amalgamated to form Tasman while also offering assistance to Robbie Deans and the Crusaders. In 2007 Tasman coach Dennis Brown stepped down with Blackadder replacing him coaching the side for the 2008 Air New Zealand Cup. In only their second year Tasman finished the 2008 season with 4 wins, 1 draw and 6 losses. = Crusaders = Following the departure of former coach Robbie Deans from the Crusaders, Blackadder was named as the sides new head coach ahead of the 2009 Super 14 Rugby Season. Blackadder led to the Crusaders to the semi-finals in his first year in charge losing to eventual champions the Bulls in Pretoria despite winning only one out of there first five matches at the start of the season. In his second year in charge, the Crusaders again fell to the Bulls in South Africa, this time 39‚Äì24. The 2011 season was a tough one for the side following the devastating Christchurch earthquakes which aside from causing loss of life and severely damaging the city, the earthquakes also wrecked their home ground at Jade Stadium. Amazingly the Crusaders managed to make the final that year after taking games throughout the wider Crusaders catchment area, New Zealand and even to Twickenham, however, the side fell tantalisingly close to a deserved victory as the Reds won their first title 18‚Äì13. In 2012 the Crusaders were knocked out by eventually champions the Chiefs 20‚Äì17 in the semi-finals before the Chiefs, on route to their second title, beat the Crusaders again in the semi-finals by the tighter margin of 20‚Äì19. In 2014, the Crusaders returned to the final but again fell short 33‚Äì32 against the Waratahs due to a last minute controversial penalty goal struck by Bernard Foley. In 2015 the Crusaders failed to make the finals, the first time Blackadder had not made them although the Crusaders extended his contract for another year. In late 2015 it was announced that the 2016 Super Rugby Season would be Blackadder's last coaching the Crusaders after eight years at the helm. In his final year the Crusaders were knocked out by beaten finalists the Lions 42‚Äì25 in Johannesburg. During his time coaching the Crusaders, Blackadder guided the side to two Grand Finals firstly in 2011 against the Reds and then again in 2014 against the Waratahs. = Bath = Blackadder was appointed Director of Rugby at Bath Rugby ahead of the 2016/17 English Premiership rugby season together with Crusaders assistant coach Tabai Matson who was appointed head coach.http://www.bathrugby.com/news/bath-rugby- announce-new-coaching-structure/ While Matson was forced to return home to New Zealand due to a family illness, Blackadder attempted to return the club to its former glory but ultimately could only manage consecutive top six finishes before on 17 April 2019 it was announced that he would be leaving the club at the end of the 2018/19 season. = Toshiba = On his release from his final year of his contract with Bath, Blackadder announced that he would be joining the Toshiba Brave Lupus in the Japanese Top League as their new head coach.  Personal life  Todd's son Ethan Blackadder currently plays for the Crusaders after making his debut for the franchise in 2018.

Korzybski held that many people do confuse maps with territories, that is, confuse models of reality with reality itself. The relationship has also been expressed in other terms, such as Alan Watts's \\"The menu is not the meal.\\" \\"A map is not the territory\\" The expression first appeared in print in \\"A Non-Aristotelian System and its Necessity for Rigour in Mathematics and Physics\\", a paper that Alfred Korzybski gave at a meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science in New Orleans, Louisiana on December 28, 1931. The paper was reprinted in Science and Sanity, 1933, pp. 747‚Äì761. In this book, Korzybski acknowledges his debt to mathematician Eric Temple Bell, whose epigram \\"the map is not the thing mapped\\"Korzybski, Alfred (1933). p. 247. was published in Numerology. The Belgian surrealist artist Ren√© Magritte illustrated the concept of \\"perception always intercedes between reality and ourselves\\"Rene Magritte's surrealism to be to illustrate the point that, \\"perception always intercedes between reality and ourselves\\". See for example, p. 15‚Äì16 Visual Intelligence: Perception, Image, and Manipulation in Visual Communication by Ann Marie Barry (bio ) in a number of paintings including a famous work entitled The Treachery of Images, which consists of a drawing of a pipe with the caption, Ceci n'est pas une pipe (\\"This is not a pipe\\"). In Understanding Media, Marshall McLuhan expanded this argument to electronic media with his introduction of the phrase \\"The Medium is the Message\\" (and later in the book titled The Medium is the Massage.) Media representations, especially on screens, are abstractions, or virtual \\"extensions\\" of what our sensory channels, bodies, thinking and feeling do for us in real life. This concept occurs in the discussion of exoteric and esoteric religions. Exoteric concepts are concepts which can be fully conveyed using descriptors and language constructs, such as mathematics. Esoteric concepts are concepts which cannot be fully conveyed except by direct experience. For example, a person who has never tasted an apple will never fully understand through language what the taste of an apple is. Only through direct experience (eating an apple) can that experience be fully understood. Lewis Carroll, in Sylvie and Bruno Concluded (1893), made the point humorously with his description of a fictional map that had \\"the scale of a mile to the mile\\". A character notes some practical difficulties with such a map and states that \\"we now use the country itself, as its own map, and I assure you it does nearly as well.\\" Jorge Luis Borges's one-paragraph short story \\"On Exactitude in Science\\" (1946) describes a map that has the same scale as its territory. Laura Riding, in her poem The Map of Places (1927), deals with this relation: \\"The map of places passes. The reality of paper tears.\\" The economist Joan Robinson (1962): \\"A model which took account of all the variegation of reality would be of no more use than a map at the scale of one to one.\\" Korzybski's argument about the map and the territory also influenced the Belgian surrealist writer of comics Jan Bucquoy for a storyline in his comic Labyrinthe: a map can never guarantee that one will find the way out, because the accumulation of events can change the way one looks at reality. Author Robert M. Pirsig uses the idea both theoretically and literally in his book Lila when the main character/author becomes temporarily lost due to an over reliance on a map, rather than the territory that the map describes.Robert M Pirsig Lila: An Inquiry into Morals (1991, pp. 363‚Äì364) In 2010, French author Michel Houellebecq published his novel, La carte et le territoire, translated into English as The Map and the Territory. The title was a reference to Alfred Korzybski's aphorism. The novel was awarded the French literary prize, the Prix Goncourt. The map-territory distinction is emphasized by Robert Anton Wilson in his book Prometheus Rising. Author James A. Lindsay made the idea that the map is not reality a primary theme of his 2013 book Dot, Dot, Dot: Infinity Plus God Equals Folly. In it, he argues that all of our scientific theories, mathematics, and even the idea of God are conceptual maps often confused \\"for the terrain\\" they attempt to explain. In a foreword to the book, physicist Victor J. Stenger expresses agreement with this point of view.Lindsay, James A. (2013). Dot, Dot, Dot: Infinity Plus God Equals Folly, Fareham: Onus Books Relationship Gregory Bateson, in \\"Form, Substance and Difference\\", from Steps to an Ecology of Mind (1972), argued the essential impossibility of knowing what any actual territory is. Any understanding of any territory is based on one or more sensory channels reporting adequately but imperfectly: Elsewhere in that same volume, Bateson argued that the usefulness of a map (a representation of reality) is not necessarily a matter of its literal truthfulness, but its having a structure analogous, for the purpose at hand, to the territory. Bateson argued this case at some length in the essay \\"The Cybernetics of ‚ÄúSelf‚Äù: A Theory of Alcoholism\\" (1971). To paraphrase Bateson's argument, a culture that believes that common colds are transmitted by evil spirits, that those spirits fly out of you when you sneeze, can pass from one person to another when they are inhaled or when both handle the same objects, etc., could have just as effective a \\"map\\" for public health as one that substituted microbes for spirits. Another basic quandary is the problem of accuracy. Jorge Luis Borges' \\"On Exactitude in Science\\" (1946) describes the tragic uselessness of the perfectly accurate, one-to-one map: A more extreme literary example, the fictional diary of Tristram Shandy is so detailed that it takes the author one year to set down the events of a single day ‚Äì because the map (diary) is more detailed than the territory (life), yet must fit into the territory (diary written in the course of his life), it can never be finished. Such tasks are referred to as supertasks. With this quotation of Josiah Royce, Borges describes a further conundrum of when the map is contained within the territory, you are led into infinite regress: Neil Gaiman retells the parable in reference to storytelling in Fragile Things (it was originally to appear in American Gods): The development of electronic media blurs the line between map and territory by allowing for the simulation of ideas as encoded in electronic signals, as Baudrillard argues in Simulacra and Simulation (1994, p. 1): The philosopher David Schmidtz draws on this distinction in his book Elements of Justice, apparently deriving it from Wittgenstein's private language argument. The fundamental trade-off between accuracy and usability of a map, particularly in the context of modelling, is known as Bonini's paradox, and has been stated in various forms, poetically by Paul Val√©ry: \\"Everything simple is false. Everything which is complex is unusable.\\" See also * All models are wrong * Blind men and an elephant * Emic and etic * Fallacy of misplaced concreteness * Good regulator * Ludic fallacy * Mary's room * Mental model * Mind projection fallacy * Nominalism * Non-Aristotelian logic * Philosophy of perception * Direct and indirect realism * Reification (fallacy) * Social constructionism * Structural differential * Symbolism (disambiguation) * Use‚Äìmention distinction * When a white horse is not a horse References External links * The Map and the Territory * Measures and Scapes MIT Department of Architecture Category:Abstraction Category:Cartography Category:Consensus reality Category:Dichotomies Category:Epistemology Category:General semantics Category:Neuro-linguistic programming concepts and methods Category:Philosophical analogies Category:Conceptual distinctions ","title":"Map‚Äìterritory relation"},{"id":"398421","text":"Mayflower in Plymouth Harbor by William Halsall (1882) John Carver (before 1584‚Äì1621) was one of the Pilgrims who braved the Mayflower voyage in 1620 which resulted in the creation of Plymouth Colony in America. He is credited with writing the Mayflower Compact and was its first signer, and he was also the first governor of Plymouth Colony.Eugene Aubrey Stratton, Plymouth Colony: Its History and People, 1620-1691, (Salt Lake City: Ancestry Publishing, 1986), p. 259Pilgrim Hall Museum John CarverA genealogical profile of John Carver, (a collaboration of Plimoth Plantation and New England Historic Genealogical Society accessed 2013-04-21) Life in Leiden Little is known about Carver's ancestry or early family life. Jeremy Bangs notes that Carver and his wife Mary were members of the Walloon church in Leiden, Holland on February 8, 1609. The Flemish Walloon community was fleeing religious persecution in their homeland (then part of the Spanish Netherlands, now split between Belgium and France), as were the Puritan separatists who came to Holland from England around 1607. Carver was a deacon in Leiden about 1609 at about age 25, and he is believed to have been born sometime before 1584. Leiden records of St. Pancras Church state that Carver buried a child on July 10, 1609. Sometime shortly after the death of the child, his wife Mary died.Eugene Aubrey Stratton, Plymouth Colony: Its History and People, 1620‚Äì1691 (Salt Lake City: Ancestry Publishing, 1986), p. 18 He later married Katherine White who was a prominent member of the Leiden English separatist church, though the exact date is not known. She was originally of Sturton in Nottinghamshire, eldest daughter of Alexander White. Carver became much more involved in the Leiden church after marrying Katherine, making a close association with Puritan pastor John Robinson, husband of Katherine's younger sister Bridget.Charles Edward Banks, The English ancestry and homes of the Pilgrim Fathers who came to Plymouth on the Mayflower in 1620, the Fortune in 1621, and the Anne and the Little James in 1623, (Baltimore: Genealogical Publishing Company, 2006), p. 44Nick Bunker, Making Haste from Babylon: The Mayflower Pilgrims and their New World a History (New York: Knopf 2010), pp. 108‚Äì109 Preparing for the New World Carver and Robert Cushman began negotiations with officials of the Virginia Company in London in 1617 for land in the Colony of Virginia where they could live and be self-governing. They came in contact with Sir Edwin Sandys, an acquaintance of church elder William Brewster and a leading member of the Virginia Company. They had to put together seven articles for the Council for Virginia, signed by all the senior Puritan church members, which acknowledged the supremacy of the king and the Church of England.Nathaniel Philbrick, Mayflower: A Story of Courage, Community and War (New York: Viking, 2006), p. 19 To fund the Mayflower voyage, the Leiden congregation turned to Thomas Weston and the Merchant Adventurers, London businessmen interested in supporting the voyage in hopes of profit. Carver had the task of organizing the voyage and negotiating funding with Weston and the Adventurers along with Cushman as the chief agent. In 1620, they were in Aldgate, London where they negotiated with Weston for financial backing.Charles Edward Banks, \\"The English Ancestry and Homes of the Pilgrim Fathers\\" (2006) Weston hired the Mayflower, and it sailed from London to Southampton to rendezvous with the Speedwell, which was carrying the Pilgrims from Leiden in Holland. Carver was in Southampton in June 1620 purchasing supplies for the Mayflower voyage, along with Christopher Martin.Philbrick, p. 42 Carver was very wealthy and provided much of his personal fortune to invest in the joint-stock company and in the Mayflower voyage itself.

The Mayflower anchored off Cape Cod in November, 1620, and the Mayflower Compact was signed aboard ship on November 11; it became the first governing document for Plymouth Colony.George Ernest Bowman, The Mayflower Compact and its signers, (Boston: Massachusetts Society of Mayflower Descendants, 1920). Photocopies of the 1622, 1646 and 1669 versions of the document pp. 7‚Äì19. Carver may have been the author of the Compact, and was definitely its first signer. He was subsequently chosen to be governor of Plymouth Colony.Stratton, pp. 142, 413 Life in Plymouth The first winter in Plymouth Colony was exceedingly difficult, as the colonists suffered greatly from lack of shelter, diseases such as scurvy, and general conditions on board ship. Nearly half the Mayflower passengers died in the course of a few months. The first will drawn up in New England was that of William Mullins, and it was written on his behalf by Carver while Mullins was on his deathbed. It was signed as the last will and testament of Mullins by Carver, Mayflower's captain Christopher Jones, and the ship's surgeon Giles Heale. This is the only known copy of Carver's signature. On March 22, 1621, Governor Carver and Wampanoag leader Massasoit worked out a treaty of peace and mutual protection. This treaty lasted for more than half a century.Dana T. Parker, \\"Reasons to Celebrate the Pilgrims,\\" (Orange County Register, Nov. 22, 2010) , Retrieved 28 Jan. 2011. Carver died in April or May 1621, aged 56 years, and his wife died five or six weeks later.  Family  John Carver married Mary de Lannoy sometime before February 8, 1609. She was a Walloon (Huguenot) of L‚ÄôEscluse, France. She may have been related to Philip de Lannoy (Delano), who came to Plymouth on the Fortune in November 1621. The couple buried a child at St. Pancras in Leiden on July 10, 1609; Mary died soon after in July 1609. He married Katherine (White) Leggatt sometime before May 22, 1615. She was the widow of George Leggatt. Mayflower genealogist Robert S. Wakefield spells her name as Catherine, but seventeenth century documents use Katherine. She died sometime in May 1621, some 5‚Äì6 weeks after Carver's death.Nick Bunker, Making Haste from Babylon: The Mayflower Pilgrims and their New World a History (New York: Knopf 2010), pp. 108-110 John and Katherine buried a child at St. Pancras in Leiden November 11, 1617. He had no known surviving descendants.  Death  Carver had been working in his field on a hot day in April 1621 when he complained of a pain in his head. He returned to his house to lie down and soon fell into a coma, and he died within a few days, not long after April 5, 1621. William Bradford was chosen to replace him as governor; Bradford was recovering from illness, so Isaac Allerton was chosen to be his assistant.Nathaniel Philbrick, p. 102Stratton, p. 143David Lindsay, Mayflower Bastard: A Stranger amongst the Pilgrims (New York: St. Martins Press, 2002), p. 46 After all the secret burials that were performed all winter, the settlers wished to bury the governor with as much ceremony as possible. Bradford wrote in April 1621: > He was buried in the best maner they could, with some vollies of shott by > all that bore armes; and his wife, being weak, dyed within five or six weeks > after him.

Biography Cary Cottage, childhood home of Alice and Phoebe Cary near Cincinnati, Ohio Alice Cary was born on April 26, 1820, in Mount Healthy, Ohio, off the Miami River near Cincinnati.Ehrlich, Eugene and Gorton Carruth. The Oxford Illustrated Literary Guide to the United States. New York: Oxford University Press, 1982: 297. Her parents lived on a farm bought by Robert Cary in 1813 in what is now North College Hill, Ohio. He called the Clovernook Farm. The farm was north of Cincinnati, a good distance from schools, and the father could not afford to give their large family of nine children a very good education. But Alice and her sister Phoebe were fond of reading and studied all they could. While the sisters were raised in a Universalist household and held political and religious views that were liberal and reformist, they often attended Methodist, Presbyterian, and Congregationalist services and were friendly with ministers of all these denominations and others. According to Phoebe, When Alice was 17 and Phoebe 13, they began to write verses, which were printed in newspapers. Their mother had died in 1835, and two years afterward their father married again. Their stepmother was wholly unsympathetic regarding the literary aspirations of Alice and Phoebe. For their part, while the sisters were ready and while willing to aid to the full extent of their strength in household labor, they persisted in a determination to study and write when the day's work was done. Sometimes they were refused the use of candles to the extent of their wishes, and the device of a saucer of lard with a bit of rag for a wick was their only light after the rest of the family had retired. Alice's first major poem, \\"The Child of Sorrow\\", was published in 1838 and was praised by influential critics including Edgar Allan Poe, Rufus Wilmot Griswold, and Horace Greeley.Reynolds, David S. Beneath the American Renaissance: The Subversive Imagination in the Age of Emerson and Melville.

Rufus Wilmot Griswold: Poe's Literary Executor. Nashville: Vanderbilt University Press, 1943. p. 213 Griswold encouraged publishers to put forth a collection of the sisters' poetry, even asking John Greenleaf Whittier to provide a preface. Whittier refused, believing their poetry did not need his endorsement, and also noting a general dislike for prefaces as a method to \\"pass off by aid of a known name, what otherwise would not pass current\\".Woodwell, Roland H. John Greenleaf Whittier: A Biography. Haverhill, Massachusetts: Trustees of the John Greenleaf Whittier Homestead, 1985: 232 In 1849, a Philadelphia publisher accepted the book, Poems of Alice and Phoebe Cary, and Griswold wrote the preface, left unsigned. By the spring of 1850, Alice and Griswold were often corresponding through letters which were often flirtatious. This correspondence ended by the summer of that year.Bayless, Joy. Rufus Wilmot Griswold: Poe's Literary Executor. Nashville: Vanderbilt University Press, 1943. p. 214‚Äì215 The anthology made Alice and Phoebe well- known, and in 1850 they moved to New York City, where they devoted themselves to writing, and garnered much fame. There, they also hosted receptions on Sunday evenings which drew notable figures including P. T. Barnum, Elizabeth Cady Stanton, John Greenleaf Whittier,Kane, Paul.

Roosevelt to George W. Bush.  The hoax  The hoax email showed Bill Clinton having the IQ (182) and George W. Bush (91). However, the numbers claimed in the email were said to be fabricated, and the sociologists and institutions (e.g., the \\"Lovenstein Institute\\") quoted in the article do not exist. The techniques purportedly used to measure the IQ of the presidents are not recognized means of measuring IQs. The hoax also contains other factual errors. When the hoax was debunked, it appeared that Bush's IQ and college entrance test scores were never released.  Reports about the hoax  Perhaps because the perception of George W. Bush having low intelligence was claimed by some political pundits as well as by politicians, the hoax report was assumed by some to be true. The British newspaper The Guardian, for example, quoted the report in its diary section of July 19, 2001 and used it to belittle Bush, although the paper published a retraction two days after the Associated Press drew attention to the error. Other media outlets to fall for the hoax included Bild (Germany), Pravda (Russia), and the Southland Times (New Zealand) as well as a few U.S. newspapers. The hoax came back to life in March 2007 in Spanish-language media when the Press Agency EFE distributed a piece referring to it. Dozens of media (primarily in their online versions) reproduced EFE's text. Among newspapers publishing the hoax were El Pa√≠s (Spain's leading newspaper), ABC, La Vanguardia, and El Mercurio (Chile's leading newspaper).  IQ estimations by academics  In 2001, political psychologist Aubrey Immelman made an IQ estimation of G. W. Bush based on the SAT Reasoning Test results of Bush (1206) and Al Gore, who achieved IQ scores of 133 and 134 in his school years, and an SAT of 1355: \\"It's tempting to employ Al Gore's IQ:SAT ratio of 134:1355 as a formula for estimating Bush's probable intelligence quotient ‚Äî an exercise in fuzzy statistics that predicts a score of 119.\\"Aubrey Immelman: \\"Bush gets bad rap on intelligence\\" . St. Cloud Times. January 14, 2001 A 2006 study analyzing presidential IQs by Dean Keith Simonton of U.C. Davis appeared in the journal Political Psychology. Simonton's study analyzed the results of varied and often subjective historical material using the tools of historiometry. It estimated IQs for all US presidents, and validated the headline of the hoax, which stated Bush's was the lowest of any president in the last 50 years, though it estimates his IQ considerably higher (by more than two standard deviations) than the 91 suggested in the hoax report. It rated G.W. Bush second to last since 1900, with an estimated IQ of 119 (the estimates ranged from 111 to 139). Bush's estimated IQ was less than those estimated for Grant (120), Monroe (124), and Harding (124). The same study estimated president Bill Clinton's IQ at 149, behind only those of Kennedy (151), Jefferson (154) and John Quincy Adams (169). Simonton's 2006 study follows earlier studies done on this subject, including a 1926 study by Catharine Cox Miles. This study concluded that there is a statistically significant correlation of 0.56 between a U.S. President's IQ and his perceived amount of success. It is worth noting that other sources and/or studies might have different results for the IQs of United States Presidents. For instance, John F. Kennedy's IQ has also been estimated to have been significantly lower than in this 2006 study (Chester Arthur biographer Thomas C. Reeves refers to an actual IQ test by Kennedy with a score of 119Thomas C. Reeves: \\"Presidential IQ\\". History News Network. November 5, 2006), while Richard Nixon's IQ has also been estimated to have been significantly higher than in this study.

For an American option this value is always greater than zero in a fair market, thus an option is always worth more than its current exercise value.Note, however, that there is also a cost component of holding an option (or any asset), based on the time value of money. As an option can be thought of as 'price insurance' (e.g., an airline insuring against unexpected soaring fuel costs caused by a hurricane), TV can be thought of as the risk premium the option seller charges the buyer‚Äîthe higher the expected risk (volatility \\\\cdot time), the higher the premium. Conversely, TV can be thought of as the price an investor is willing to pay for potential upside. Time value decays to zero at expiration, with a general rule that it will lose of its value during the first half of its life and in the second half. As an option moves closer to expiry, moving its price requires an increasingly larger move in the price of the underlying security. Understanding Option Pricing Hans Wagner Intrinsic value The intrinsic value (IV) of an option is the value of exercising it now. If the price of the underlying stock is above a call option strike price, the option has a positive monetary value, and is referred to as being in-the-money. If the underlying stock is priced cheaper than the call option's strike price, the call option is referred to as being out-of-the- money. If an option is out-of-the-money at expiration, its holder simply abandons the option and it expires worthless. Hence, a purchased option can never have a negative value. Understanding Option Pricing Hans Wagner This is because a rational investor would choose to buy the underlying stock at the market price rather than exercise an out-of-the-money call option to buy the same stock at a higher-than-market price. For the same reasons, a put option is in-the-money if it allows the purchase of the underlying at a market price below the strike price of the put option. A put option is out-of-the-money if the underlying's spot price is higher than the strike price. As shown in the below equations and graph, the intrinsic value (IV) of a call option is positive when the underlying asset's spot price S exceeds the option's strike price K. :Value of a call option: \\\\max[ (S-K) , 0 ], or (S-K)^{+} :Value of a put option: \\\\max[ (K-S) , 0 ], or (K-S)^{+} Option value Option Value Option value (i.e.,. price) is estimated via a predictive formula such as Black-Scholes or using a numerical method such as the Binomial model. This price incorporates the expected probability of the option finishing \\"in-the- money\\". For an out-of-the-money option, the further in the future the expiration date‚Äîi.e. the longer the time to exercise‚Äîthe higher the chance of this occurring, and thus the higher the option price; for an in-the-money option the chance of being in the money decreases; however the fact that the option cannot have negative value also works in the owner's favor. The sensitivity of the option value to the amount of time to expiry is known as the option's theta. The option value will never be lower than its IV. As seen on the graph, the full call option value (IV + TV), at a given time t, is the red line.Note that the X axis is not time ‚Äî the graph represents the relationship between price and value at a particular time. With more time left to expiration, the red curve would be higher; the closer to expiration, the more it would approach the blue intrinsic value line. Time value Time value is, as above, the difference between option value and intrinsic value, i.e. :\`Time Value = Option Value ‚àí Intrinsic Value\` More specifically, TV reflects the probability that the option will gain in IV ‚Äî become (more) profitable to exercise before it expires.Option premium valuation 22 August 2007 An important factor is the option's volatility. Volatile prices of the underlying instrument can stimulate option demand, enhancing the value. Numerically, this value depends on the time until the expiration date and the volatility of the underlying instrument's price. TV of American option cannot be negative (because the option value is never lower than IV), and converges to zero at expiration. Prior to expiration, the change in TV with time is non- linear, being a function of the option price.Options: Time Value, wolfram.com See also * Intrinsic value (finance) * Naked call * Time value of money References External links *Basic Options Concepts: Intrinsic Value and Time Value, biz.yahoo.com Category:Options (finance) ","title":"Option time value"},{"id":"398443","text":"The eyebrowed thrush (Turdus obscurus) is a member of the thrush family Turdidae.

In 2011, an eyebrowed thrush was sighted in Australia, near Malanda in Queensland. This is possibly the first confirmed sighting of the species on the Australian mainland.

Other common elements are satire and social criticism. Much erotic literature features erotic art, illustrating the text. Despite cultural disapproval of such material, circulation of erotic literature was not seen as a major problem before the invention of printing, as the costs of producing individual manuscripts limited distribution to a very small group of wealthy and literate readers. The invention of printing, in the 15th century, brought with it both a greater market and increasing restrictions, including censorship and legal restraints on publication on the grounds of obscenity.Hyde (1964); pp. 1‚Äì26 Because of this, much of the production of this type of material became clandestine.Patrick J.

Parragon: 7‚Äì18 Erotic verse Sappho, the tenth Muse, fresco from Pompeii =Early periods= The oldest love poem ever found is Istanbul 2461, an erotic monologue written by a female speaker directed to king Shu-Sin. In ancient Sumer, a whole cycle of poems revolved around the erotic lovemaking between the goddess Inanna and her consort Dumuzid the Shepherd. In the Hebrew Bible, the Song of Songs, found in the last section of the Tanakh, celebrates sexual love, giving \\"the voices of two lovers, praising each other, yearning for each other, proffering invitations to enjoy\\". Many erotic poems have survived from ancient Greece and Rome. The Greek poets Straton of Sardis and Sappho of Lesbos both wrote erotic lyric poems.Derek Parker 404, ed. (1980) An Anthology of Erotic Verse. London: Constable The poet Archilochus wrote numerous satirical poems filled with obscene and erotic imagery. Erotic poems continued to be written in Hellenistic and Roman times by writers like Automedon (The Professional and Demetrius the Fortunate), Philodemus (Charito) and Marcus Argentarius. Notable Roman erotic poets included Catullus, Propertius, Tibullus, Ovid, Martial and Juvenal, and the anonymous Priapeia. Some later Latin authors such as Joannes Secundus also wrote erotic verse. Haft Peykar () also known as Bahramnameh (, The Book of Bahram) is a romantic epic by the Persian poet Nizami Ganjavi written in 1197. This poem is a part of the Nizami's Khamsa. The original title Haft Peykar can be translated literally as ‚Äúseven portraits‚Äù with the figurative meaning of ‚Äúseven beauties.‚Äù The poem is a masterpiece of erotic literature, but it is also a profoundly moralistic work.Fran√ßois de Blois.

During the Renaissance period, many poems were not written for publication; instead, they were merely circulated in manuscript form among a relatively limited readership. This was the original method of circulation for the Sonnets of William Shakespeare, who also wrote the erotic poems Venus and Adonis and The Rape of Lucrece.Derek Parker, ed. (1980) An Anthology of Erotic Verse; pp. 88‚Äì96 =17th and 18th centuries= Portrait by Jacob Huysmans of John Wilmot, Earl of Rochester, a notorious author of erotic verse In the 17th century, John Wilmot, Earl of Rochester (1647‚Äì80) was notorious for obscene verses, many of which were published posthumously in compendiums of poetry by him and other Restoration rakes such as Sir Charles Sedley, Charles Sackville, 6th Earl of Dorset, and George Etherege. Though many of the poems attributed to Rochester were actually by other authors, his reputation as a libertine was such that his name was used as a selling point by publishers of collections of erotic verse for centuries after. One poem which definitely was by him was \\"A Ramble in St. James's Park\\" in which the protagonist's quest for healthy exercise in the park uncovers instead \\"Bugg'ries, Rapes and Incest\\" on ground polluted by debauchery from the time when \\"Ancient Pict began to Whore\\". This poem was being censored from collections of Rochester's poetry as late as 1953, though, in line with a general change in attitudes to sexuality, it was dramatised as a scene in the film The Libertine about his life based on an existing play.Patrick J.

These poems have been attributed to John Wilkes and/or Thomas Potter and receive the distinction of being the only works of erotic literature ever read out loud, in their entirety in the House of Lords‚Äîbefore being declared obscene and blasphemous by that august body and the supposed author, Wilkes, declared an outlaw.Patrick J. Kearney (1982) A History of Erotic Literature. Parragon Books: 71-4 Robert Burns worked to collect and preserve Scottish folk songs, sometimes revising, expanding, and adapting them. One of the better known of these collections is The Merry Muses of Caledonia (the title is not by Burns), a collection of bawdy lyrics that were popular in the music halls of Scotland as late as the 20th century. =19th century= Maurice Ray for Pierre Lou√øs's Aphrodite: m≈ìurs antiques One of the 19th century's foremost poets‚ÄîAlgernon Charles Swinburne‚Äîdevoted much of his considerable talent to erotic verse, producing, inter alia, twelve eclogues on flagellation titled The Flogging Block \\"by Rufus Rodworthy, annotated by Barebum Birchingly\\";Derek Parker, ed. (1980) An Anthology of Erotic Verse: 22 more was published anonymously in The Whippingham Papers (c. 1888).Bragman, L. J. (1934). \\"The Case of Algernon Charles Swinburne: a study in Sadism\\". Psychoanal. Rev. 404, 21:59‚Äì74. Another notorious anonymous 19th-century poem on the same subject is The Rodiad, ascribed (seemingly falsely and in jest) to George Colman the Younger. John Camden Hotten even wrote a pornographic comic opera, Lady Bumtickler‚Äôs Revels, on the theme of flagellation in 1872. Pierre Lou√øs helped found a literary review, La Conque in 1891,Rosemary Lloyd, Mallarm√©: the Poet and His Circle, Ithaca, NY: Cornell University Press 404, 2005, , pp. 195-197 where he proceeded to publish Astarte‚Äîan early collection of erotic verse already marked by his distinctive elegance and refinement of style. He followed up in 1894 with another erotic collection in 143 prose poems‚ÄîSongs of Bilitis (Les Chansons de Bilitis), this time with strong lesbian themes. =20th century= Although D. H. Lawrence could be regarded as a writer of love poems, he usually dealt in the less romantic aspects of love such as sexual frustration or the sex act itself. Ezra Pound, in his Literary Essays, complained of Lawrence's interest in his own \\"disagreeable sensations\\" but praised him for his \\"low-life narrative.\\" This is a reference to Lawrence's dialect poems akin to the Scots poems of Robert Burns, in which he reproduced the language and concerns of the people of Nottinghamshire from his youth. He called one collection of poems Pansies partly for the simple ephemeral nature of the verse but also a pun on the French word panser, to dress or bandage a wound. \\"The Noble Englishman\\" and \\"Don't Look at Me\\" were removed from the official edition of Pansies on the grounds of obscenity; Lawrence felt wounded by this. From the age of 17, Gavin Ewart acquired a reputation for wit and accomplishment through such works as \\"Phallus in Wonderland\\" and \\"Poems and Songs\\", which appeared in 1939 and was his first collection. The intelligence and casually flamboyant virtuosity with which he framed his often humorous commentaries on human behaviour made his work invariably entertaining and interesting. The irreverent eroticism for which his poetry is noted resulted in W H Smith's banning of his \\"The Pleasures of the Flesh\\" (1966) from their shops. Canadian poet John Glassco wrote Squire Hardman (1967), a long poem in heroic couplets, purporting to be a reprint of an 18th-century poem by George Colman the Younger, on the theme of flagellation. Also, the Italian Una Chi distinguished herself among other publications for coldly analytical prose and for the crudeness of the stories. Erotic fiction Erotic fiction is the name given to fiction that deals with sex or sexual themes, generally in a more literary or serious way than the fiction seen in pornographic magazines and sometimes including elements of satire or social criticism. Such works have frequently been banned by the government or religious authorities. It should be noted, however, that apparently non-fictional works dealing with sex or sexual themes may contain fictional elements; calling an erotic book 'a memoir' is a literary device that is common in this genre. For reasons similar to those that make pseudonyms both commonplace and often deviously set up, the boundary between fiction and non-fiction is often very diffuse. Erotic fiction is credited in large part for the sexual awakening and liberation of women into the 20th and 21st centuries. =History of western erotic fiction= Ancient, medieval, and early modern periods 1757 Latin edition of the Dialogues of Luisa Sigea (first published c. 1660) by Nicholas Chorier Title- page and frontispiece of The London Jilt; Or, the Politick Whore, London, 1683 The Satyricon of Petronius Arbiter (later made into a film by Fellini) is an ancient Roman novel, which has partially survived, narrating the misadventures of an impotent man named Encolpius, who has been cursed by the god Priapus. The novel is filled with bawdy and obscene episodes, including orgies, ritual sex, and other erotic incidents. The discovery of several fragments of Lollianos's Phoenician Tale reveal that a genre of picaresque erotic novel also existed in ancient Greece. Meanwhile, some of the ancient Greek romance novels, such as Daphnis and Chloe, also contain elements of sexual fantasy. From the medieval period, there is the Decameron (1353) by the Italian Giovanni Boccaccio (made into a film by Pasolini) which features tales of lechery by monks and the seduction of nuns from convents. This book was banned in many countries. Even five centuries after publication copies were seized and destroyed by the authorities in the US and the UK. For instance between 1954 and 1958 eight orders for destruction of the book were made by English magistrates.Hyde (1964); pp. 71‚Äì72 From the 15th century, another classic of Italian erotica is a series of bawdy folk tales called the Facetiae by Gian Francesco Poggio Bracciolini. The Tale of Two Lovers () written in 1444 was one of the bestselling books of the 15th century, even before its author, Aeneas Sylvius Piccolomini, became Pope Pius II. It is one of the earliest examples of an epistolary novel, full of erotic imagery. The first printed edition was published by Ulrich Zel in Cologne between 1467 and 1470. The 16th century was notable for the Heptameron of Marguerite de Navarre (1558), inspired by Boccaccio's Decameron and the notorious I Modi which married erotic drawings, depicting postures assumed in sexual intercourse, by Giulio Romano, with obscene sonnets by Pietro Aretino.Hyde (1964); pp. 75‚Äì76 Aretino also wrote the celebrated whore dialogue Ragionamenti, in which the sex lives of wives, whores and nuns are compared and contrasted.Hyde (1964); pp. 76Ian Frederick Moulton, Before Pornography: erotic writing in Early Modern England (Studies in the History of Sexuality.) Oxford: Oxford University Press 404, 2004, , p.130 Later works in the same genre include La Retorica delle Puttane (The Whore's Rhetoric) (1642) by Ferrante Pallavicino;Wendy Beth Heller, Emblems of Eloquence: opera and women's voices in seventeenth-century Venice, Berkeley: University of California Press 404, 2003, , p.75James Turner, Libertines and Radicals in Early Modern London: sexuality, politics, and literary culture, 1630‚Äì1685.

Mililot (sic). Pascal Durand edited it in 1959.The School of Venus (orig: L'√âcole des filles, ou la Philosophie des dames) by Michel Millot et Jean L'Ange (New American Library 404 1971) (Panther 1972) In his diary Samuel Pepys records reading and (in an often censored passage) masturbating over this work.Hyde (1964); p. 19 Chorier's Dialogues of Luisa Sigea goes a bit further than its predecessors in this genre and has the older female giving practical instruction of a lesbian nature to the younger woman plus recommending the spiritual and erotic benefits of a flogging from willing members of the holy orders.Muchembled (2008) p. 77 This work was translated into many languages under various different titles, appearing in English as A Dialogue between a Married Woman and a Maid in various editions.Patrick J. Kearney (1982) A History of Erotic Literature. Parragon: 34‚Äì46 The School of Women first appeared as a work in Latin entitled Aloisiae Sigaeae, Toletanae, Satyra sotadica de arcanis Amoris et Veneris. This manuscript claimed that it was originally written in Spanish by Luisa Sigea de Velasco, an erudite poet and maid of honor at the court of Lisbon and was then translated into Latin by Jean or Johannes Meursius. The attribution to Sigea and Meursius was a lie; the true author was Nicolas Chorier. A unique work of this time is Sodom, or the Quintessence of Debauchery (1684), a closet play by the notorious Restoration rake, John Wilmot, 2nd Earl of Rochester in which Bolloxinion, King of Sodom, authorises \\"that buggery may be used O'er all the land, so cunt be not abused\\", which order, though appealing to soldiery, has deleterious effects generally, leading the court physician to counsel: \\"Fuck women, and let Bugg'ry be no more\\".Kronhausen (1969); pp. 26‚Äì32 18th century Scene from chapter eight of Fanny Hill An early pioneer of the publication of erotic works in England was Edmund Curll (1675‚Äì1747) who published many of the Merryland books. These were a somewhat peculiar English genre of erotic fiction in which the female body (and sometimes the male) was described in terms of a landscape.Patrick J Kearney (1982) A History of Erotic Literature. Parragon: 53-7 The earliest work in this genre seems to be Erotopolis: The Present State of Bettyland (1684) probably by Charles Cotton. This was included, in abbreviated form, in The Potent Ally: or Succours from Merryland (1741). Other works include A New Description of Merryland. Containing a Topographical, Geographical and Natural History of that Country (1740) by Thomas Stretzer, Merryland Displayed (1741) and set of maps entitled A Compleat Set of Charts of the Coasts of Merryland (1745). The last book in this genre appears to be a parody of Laurence Sterne's A Sentimental Journey Through France and Italy (1768) entitled La Souriciere. The Mousetrap. A Facetious and Sentimental Excursion through part of Austrian Flanders and France (1794) by \\"Timothy Touchit\\". The rise of the novel in 18th-century England provided a new medium for erotica. One of the most famous in this new genre was Fanny Hill (1748) by John Cleland. This book set a new standard in literary smut and was often adapted for the cinema in the 20th century. Peter Fryer suggests that Fanny Hill was a high point in British erotica, at least in the eighteenth century, in a way that mainstream literature around it had also reached a peak at that time, with writers like Defoe, Richardson and Fielding all having made important and lasting contributions to literature in its first half. After 1750, he suggests, when the Romantic period began, the quality of mainstream writing and of smut declined in tandem. Writes Fryer: \\"sex was driven out of the English novel in the latter half of the eighteenth century. The castration of imaginative English literature made the clandestine literature of sex the most poverty stricken and boring in Europe\\".Peter Fryer (1966) Public Case- Private Scandal, Secker & Warburg, p. 84 Justine, or The Misfortunes of Virtue Meanwhile, French writers kept their stride. One genre, which vies in oddness with the English \\"Merryland\\" productions, was inspired by the newly translated Arabian Nights and involved the transformation of people into objects which were in propinquity with or employed in sexual relationships: such as sofas, dildos and even bidets. The climax of this trend is represented in French philosopher Diderot's Les Bijoux indiscrets (1747) in which a magic ring is employed to get women's vaginas to give an account of their intimate sexual histories.Patrick J. Kearney (1982) A History of Erotic Literature. Parragon: 60-5 Other works of French erotica from this period include Th√©r√®se Philosophe (1748) by Jean-Baptiste de Boyer, Marquis d'Argens which describes a girl's initiation into the secrets of both philosophy and sex.;Mark Steel (2003) Vive la R√©volution. London, Scribner; pp. 39‚Äì40 The Lifted Curtain or Laura's Education, about a young girl's sexual initiation by her father, written by the French revolutionary politician Comte de Mirabeau; also Les Liaisons dangereuses (Dangerous Liaisons) by Pierre Choderlos de Laclos, first published in 1782. In the late 18th century, such works as Justine, or the Misfortunes of Virtue and 120 Days of Sodom by the Marquis de Sade were exemplars of the theme of sado-masochism and influenced later erotic accounts of Sadism and masochism in fiction. De Sade (as did the later writer Sacher- Masoch) lent his name to the sexual acts which he describes in his work. 19th century In the Victorian period, the quality of erotic fiction was much below that of the previous century‚Äîit was largely written by 'hacks'. Some works, however, borrowed from established literary models, such as Dickens. It also featured a curious form of social stratification. Even in the throes of orgasm, the social distinctions between master and servant (including form of address) were scrupulously observed. Significant elements of sado-masochism were present in some examples, perhaps reflecting the influence of the English public school, where flagellation was routinely used as a punishment.Ronald Pearsall (1969) \\"The Worm in the Bud: the world of Victorian sexuality\\", Macmillan; pp. 404‚Äì22 These clandestine works were often anonymous or written under a pseudonym, and sometimes undated, thus definite information about them often proves elusive. English erotic novels from this period include The Lustful Turk (1828); The Romance of Lust (1873); The Convent School, or Early Experiences of A Young Flagellant (1876) by Rosa Coote [pseud.]; The Mysteries of Verbena House, or, Miss Bellasis Birched for Thieving (1882) by Etonensis [pseud.], actually by George Augustus Sala and James Campbell Reddie; The Autobiography of a Flea (1887); Venus in India (1889) by 'Captain Charles Devereaux';Hyam, Ronald (1990) \\"Empire and sexuality: the British experience\\", in: Studies in Imperialism, Manchester University Press ; p. 135Jarman, Francis (2005) White Skin, Dark Skin, Power, Dream: collected essays on literature and culture (I.

Coverpage of a catalogue of books published by Charles Carrington (Paris, 1906) The centre of the trade in such material in England at this period was Holywell Street, off the Strand, London. An important publisher of erotic material in the early 19th century was George Cannon (1789‚Äì1854), followed in mid-century by William Dugdale (1800‚Äì1868) and John Camden Hotten (1832‚Äì1873).Hyde (1964): 167‚Äì68 An important and entertaining conspectus and evaluation of 19th-century (pre-1885) and earlier underground erotica, from the author's own private archive, is provided by Victorian writer Henry Spencer Ashbee, using the pseudonym \\"Pisanus Fraxi\\", in his bibliographical trilogy Index Librorum Prohibitorum (1877), Centuria Librorum Absconditorum (1879) and Catena Librorum Tacendorum (1885). His plot summaries of the works he discusses in these privately printed volumes are themselves a contribution to the genre. Originally of very limited circulation, changing attitudes have led to his work now being widely available.Henry Spencer Ashbee (1969) Index of Forbidden Books. SphereSteven Marcus (1969) The Other Victorians. London, Corgi; pp. 34‚Äì77 Notable European works of erotica at this time were Gamiani, or Two Nights of Excess (1833) by Frenchman Alfred de Musset and Venus in Furs (1870) by the Austrian author Leopold von Sacher-Masoch. The latter erotic novella brought the attention of the world to the phenomenon of masochism, named after the author. Towards the end of the 19th century, a more \\"cultured\\" form of erotica began to appear by such as the poet Algernon Charles Swinburne who pursued themes of paganism, lesbianism and sado-masochism in such works as Lesbia Brandon and in contributions to The Whippingham Papers (1888) edited by St George Stock, author of The Romance of Chastisement (1866). This was associated with the Decadent movement, in particular, with Aubrey Beardsley and the Yellow Book. But it was also to be found in France, amongst such writers as Pierre Louys, author of Les chansons de Bilitis (1894) (a celebration of lesbianism and sexual awakening). Pioneering works of male homosexual erotica from this time were The Sins of the Cities of the Plain (1881),Harford Montgomery Hyde, \\"The love that dared not speak its name: a candid history of homosexuality in Britain\\", Little, Brown, 1970, pp.121‚Äì123 which features the celebrated Victorian transvestite duo of Boulton and Park as characters,Ronald Pearsall (1971) The Worm in the Bud: The World of Victorian Sexuality.

Vladimir Nabokov's Lolita is usually described as an erotic novel, but in the view of some it is a literary drama with elements of eroticism. Like Nabokov's Lolita, Johannes Linnankoski's The Song of the Blood-Red Flower is also often described as erotic novel, only a little explicit and cleverly cloaked in gentler romance.Erotica, pp. 102‚Äì103 Lolita and The Story of O were published by Olympia Press, a Paris-based publisher, launched in 1953 by Maurice Girodias as a rebadged version of the Obelisk Press he inherited from his father Jack Kahane. It published a mix of erotic fiction and avant-garde literary works. The Girls of Radcliff Hall is a roman √† clef novel in the form of a lesbian girls' school story written in the 1930s by the British composer and bon- vivant Gerald Berners, the 14th Lord Berners, under the pseudonym \\"Adela Quebec\\", published and distributed privately in 1932. Another trend in the twentieth century was the rise of the lesbian pulp fiction. Works such as The Price of Salt (1952), Spring Fire (1952), Desert of the Heart (1964), and Patience and Sarah (1969) were only a few examples of this subgenre. Many of the authors were women themselves, such as Gale Wilhelm and Ann Bannon. Many male homosexuals also enjoyed gay pulp fiction, which borrowed the same sexploitation format as the lesbian books. =Asian erotic fiction= Front cover of the 1705 edition of The Carnal Prayer Mat Chinese literature has a tradition of erotic fiction dating back to at least the 16th century. The earliest novel with explicit sexuality is Ruyijun zhuan (The Lord of Perfect Satisfaction), by Xu Changling. The critic Charles Stone has argued that pornographic technique is the \\"union of banality, obscenity, and repetition,\\" and contains just the \\"rudiments\\" of plot, style, and characterization, while anything that is not sexually stimulating is avoided. If this is the case, he concluded, then The Lord of Perfect Satisfaction is the \\"fountainhead of Chinese erotica,\\" but not pornography.Charles R. Stone. The Fountainhead of Chinese Erotica: The Lord of Perfect Satisfaction (Ruyijun Zhuan) with a Translation and Critical Edition. (Honolulu: University of Hawai'i Press, 2003), pp. 13‚Äì14. . Another notable work is The Carnal Prayer Mat usually attributed to Li Yu (1657). The most famous sexually explicit novel is the Jin Ping Mei written by an author who used only a pseudonym (his real name is unknown). There is also a tradition of erotic fiction in Japan. Some portion of this is doujinshi, or independent comics, which are often fan fiction. The sharebon (Ê¥íËêΩÊú¨) was a pre-modern Japanese literary genre. Plots revolved around humor and entertainment at the pleasure quarters. It is a subgenre of gesaku. In Indonesia, a mysterious erotic writer known only as Enny Arrow; facebook wrote countless novels from the late 1970s until the early 1990s which were secretly circulated through magazine sellers. Most of the novels are known for their vulgar and hyperbolic, sometimes comical language. They are now regarded as classics by some Indonesians and have been scanned for historical purposes. =Contemporary erotic fiction= In the 21st century, a number of female authors have risen to prominence, including Alison Tyler, Rachel Kramer Bussel and Carol Queen. Janine Ashbless, Kristina Lloyd, and Portia da Costa are well known for their erotic novels and short stories. Kristina Wright is well known for her bestselling genre themed anthologies through Cleis Press, including steampunk erotica, paranormal erotic romance, and fairy tale erotica, exemplified by authors such as Shanna Germain and Michelle Augello-Page. Mitzi Szereto is an editor and author who wants to see the term 'erotica' removed from novels and anthologies that include depictions of sexual activities. Other authors celebrate the term 'erotica' but also question why literature 'with the sex left in' should be considered outside literary fiction. The debate has been rekindled by the release, in 2012, of the 50 Shades of Grey trilogy written by E. L. James. The phenomenal success of her erotica for every woman, dubbed 'mommyporn', has given rise to satires like Fifty Shames of Earl Grey by 'Fanny Merkin' (real name Andrew Shaffer), a book of essays called Fifty Writers on Fifty Shades (ed. Lori Perkins) and editors of erotic imprints re-evaluating the content and presentation of the genre.> A development in contemporary erotica has been that, contrary to some previous views that it was mainly a male interest, many women readers are aroused by it, whether it be traditional pornography or tailor-made women's erotica. Romantic novels are sometimes marketed as erotica‚Äîor vice versa‚Äîas \\"mainstream\\" romance in recent decades has begun to exhibit blatant (if poetic) descriptions of sex. Erotic romance is a relatively new genre of romance with an erotic theme and very explicit love scenes, but with a romance at the heart of the story. Erotic fantasy is a subgenre of fantasy fiction and utilizes erotica in a fantasy setting. These stories can essentially cover any of the other subgenres of fantasy, such as high fantasy, contemporary fantasy, or even historical fantasy. The extents of the genre to break existing conventions and limits in subject matter have managed to shock popular audiences, with genres such as monster erotica emerging with the ease of digital publishing. Erotic fantasy fiction has similarities to romantic fantasy but is more explicit. Erotic fantasy can also be found in fan fiction, which uses plot elements and characters from popular fiction such as television series, movies or novels. Erotic fan fiction may use characters from existing works in relationships undreamed of by their creators, such as \\"slash\\" (homoerotic) fan fiction. Fan fiction and its Japanese counterpart, doujinshi, account for an enormous proportion of all erotica written today. Internet erotic fiction The Internet and digital revolution in erotic depiction has changed the forms of representing scenes of a sexual nature. One researcher concluded that erotic literature was available among the poor and performed at public readings in 18th-century Britain. Erotica was present on the Internet from the earliest days, as seen from rec.arts.erotica on Usenet. This news group was a moderated forum for the exchange of erotic stories that predated the creation of the World Wide Web. Most of this migrated to the alt.* hierarchy forums by the 1990s, including alt.sex.stories. The vast majority of Internet erotica is of an amateur nature, written for the enjoyment of the author and readers instead of for profit. Increased interactivity and anonymity allows casual or hobby writers the opportunity not only to author their own stories but also to share them with a world-wide audience. Many authors adopt colorful pseudonyms and can develop cult followings within their genre, though a small number use (or claim to use) their real names. Among transgender or genderqueer authors it is a common practice to adopt a feminine or masculine alter-ego, although it is not unheard of for a writer to use their own given name. Student erotica Portrayal of Erotica at the library of Congress In the 21st century, a new literary genre of student published journals at American universities was started. The following is a partial list of publications: * The Moderator - Bard College * Virgin Mawrtyr ‚Äì Bryn Mawr College * H-Bomb ‚Äì Harvard University Quake ‚Äì University of Pennsylvania * Squirm ‚Äì Vassar College * Vita Excolatur ‚Äì University of Chicago * Bang and UntouchablesSwarthmore College#Publications ‚Äì Swarthmore College * Boink - Boston University Other accounts =Writings of prostitutes= Harris's List of Covent Garden LadiesProstitution was the focus of much of the earliest erotic works. The very term \\"pornography\\" is derived from the Greek pornographos meaning \\"writer about prostitutes\\", originally denoting descriptions of the lives and manners of prostitutes and their customers in Ancient Greece. According to Athenaeus in The Deipnosophists these constituted a considerable genre, with many lubricious treatises, stories and dramas on the subject.Hyde (1964); pp. 34‚Äì44 A surviving example of this genre is Lucian of Samosata's Dialogues of the Courtesans. Accounts of prostitution have continued as a major part of the genre of erotic literature. In the 18th century directories of prostitutes and their services, such as Harris's List of Covent Garden Ladies (1757‚Äì1795), provided both entertainment and instruction. In the 19th century, the sensational journalism of W. T. Stead's The Maiden Tribute of Modern Babylon (1885) about the procuring of underage girls into the brothels of Victorian London provided a stimulus for the erotic imagination. Stead's account was widely translated and the revelation of \\"padded rooms for the purpose of stifling the cries of the tortured victims of lust and brutality\\" and the symbolic figure of \\"The Minotaur of London\\" confirmed European observers worst imaginings about \\"Le Sadisme anglais\\" and inspired erotic writers to write of similar scenes set in London or involving sadistic English gentlemen. Such writers include D'Annunzio in Il Piacere, Paul-Jean Toulet in Monsieur de Paur (1898), Octave Mirbeau in Jardin des Supplices (1899) and Jean Lorrain in Monsieur de Phocas (1901).Mario Praz (1970) The Romantic Agony. Oxford University Press: 443‚Äì451 Well-known recent works in this genre are The Happy Hooker: My Own Story (1971) by the Dutch madame Xaviera Hollander and The Intimate Adventures of a London Call Girl (2005) by Belle de Jour. =Erotic memoirs= Medallion portrait of Casanova, engraving by Berka, used as frontispiece for Icosameron (1788) Erotic memoirs include Casanova's Histoire de ma vie, from the 18th century. Notable English works of this genre from the 19th century include The Ups and Downs of Life (1867) by Edward Sellon and My Secret Life by \\"Walter\\". Edward Sellon was a writer, translator and illustrator of erotic literature who wrote erotica for the pornographic publisher William Dugdale, including such works as The New Epicurean (1865).H. Montgomery Hyde (1964) A History of Pornography: 113-5 The true identity of \\"Walter\\" is very mysterious. Ian Gibson, in The Erotomaniac speculates that My Secret Life was really written by Henry Spencer Ashbee and therefore it is possible that \\"Walter\\" is a fiction. A famous German erotic work of this time, published in two parts in 1868 and 1875 entitled Pauline the Prima Donna purports to be the memoirs of the opera singer Wilhelmine Schr√∂der-Devrient. Various discrepancies with known facts of the singer's life, however, have led many to doubt the veracity of this book and the erotic adventures contained in the second volume, at least, appear to be very implausible. These include the author indulging in lesbian sadomasochism, group sex, sodomy, bestiality, scatology, necrophilia, prostitution and vampirism: all before she had reached the age of 27.Clifford J. Scheiner (1996) The Essential Guide to Erotic Literature, Part One: Before 1920. Ware: Wordsworth: 91‚Äì113 20th-century contributions to the genre include Frank Harris's My Life and Loves (1922‚Äì27) and the convicted Austrian sex criminal Edith Cadivec's Confessions and Experiences and its sequel Eros, the Meaning of My Life (published together 1930-1).Armand Coppens (1973) The Memoirs of an Erotic Bookseller. St Albans, Panther: 66‚Äì69 A 21st-century example is One Hundred Strokes of the Brush Before Bed (2004) by Melissa Panarello. =Sex manuals= Sex manuals are among the oldest forms of erotic literature. Three brief fragments of a sex manual written in the fourth century BC that is attributed to Philaenis of Samos have survived, though modern scholars generally regard it as a work of parody probably written by a man, most likely the Athenian sophist Polycrates. Other examples of the genre from the classical world include the lost works of Elephantis and Ovid's Ars Amatoria. The Indian Kama Sutra is one of the world's best-known works of this type. The Ananga Ranga, a 12th-century collection of Indian erotic works, is a lesser known one. Also very famous, and often reprinted and translated, is The Perfumed Garden for the Soul's Recreation, a 16th-century Arabic work by Sheikh Nefzaoui. There is anecdotal evidence that at least as late as the mid-20th century sex therapists and other physicians prescribed erotic literature as treatment for erectile dysfunction. The ancient Chinese versions of the sex manual include the texts that contain the Taoist sexual practices. These include books that show illustrations of the ideal sexual behavior because sex in this religion is not considered taboo but a manifestation of the concept of the yin and yang, wherein the male and female engage in an act of \\"joining of energy\\" or \\"joining of essences\\". The belief is that proper sexual practice is key to achieving good health. The manuals included the Ishinpo text, which is a medical document that also included sections devoted to sexual hygiene and sexual manuals of the Tang and Han dynasties. Chi kung manuals include warming a wet towel and covering penis for a few minutes, then rubbing one direction away from base of penis hundreds of times daily, similar to chi kung. Squeezing sphincter while semi-erect or fully erect dozens of times daily, particularly a few hours before intercourse will help delay orgasm or enhance non-ejaculatory pleasure. The Universal Tao system was developed by Mantak Chia to teach Taoist meditative and exercise techniques to balance the body and increase and refine one's vital energy, or chi (\\"chee\\"). Front and back channel, the back channel is where the perineum is located between anus and scrotum moving up the tailbone to the crown, the front channel is moving down the front of your body down the midline. Breathing up the back channel and then breathing out from the front channel down to and from the abdomen moves chi. Many practices combined help chi to be transformed into spiritual energy or shen. Not all sex manuals were produced to arouse or inform readers about sexual acts. There are also those created as a form of satire or social criticism. For instance, there is the case of mock-sex manual produced in the early sixteenth century by Pietro Aretino in response to the clerical censorship of the nude engravings of the Roman artists Marcantonio Raimondi. This was released in cheap wood, with a corresponding sonnet serving as the \\"voice\\" of the characters. Legal status =Early legislation= To 1857 Cover of an undated American edition of Fanny Hill, c. 1910 Erotic or pornographic works have often been prosecuted, censored and destroyed by the authorities on grounds of obscenity. In Medieval England, erotic or pornographic publications were the concern of the ecclesiastical courts. After the Reformation the jurisdiction of these courts declined in favour of the Crown which licensed every printed book. Prosecutions of books for their erotic content alone were rare and works which attacked the church or state gave much more concern to the authorities than erotica or 'obscene libel' as it was then known. For instance the Licensing Act of 1662 was aimed generally at \\"heretical, seditious, schismatical or offensive books of pamphlets\\" rather than just erotica per se. Even this Licensing Act was allowed to lapse in 1695 and no attempt made to renew it. The first conviction for obscenity in England occurred in 1727, when Edmund Curll was fined for the publication of Venus in the Cloister or The Nun in her Smock under the common law offence of disturbing the King's peace. This set a legal precedent for other convictions.\\"The Obscenity of Censorship: A History of Indecent People and Lacivious Publications,\\" The Erotica Bibliophile. Retrieved May 29, 2006. The publication of other books by Curll, however, considered seditious and blasphemous, such as The Memoirs of John Ker, apparently most offended the authorities. Prosecutions of erotica later in the 18th century were rare and were most often taken because of the admixture of seditious and blasphemous material with the porn. 1857‚Äì1959 Erotic literature going up in smoke and its distributors being put in jail, courtesy of Anthony Comstock's New York Society for the Suppression of Vice. It was the Obscene Publications Act 1857 which made the sale of obscene material a statutory offence, for the first time, giving the courts power to seize and destroy offending material. The origins of the Act itself were in a trial for the sale of pornography presided over by the Lord Chief Justice, Lord Campbell, at the same time as a debate in the House of Lords over a bill aiming to restrict the sale of poisons. Campbell was taken by the analogy between the two situations, famously referring to the London pornography trade as \\"a sale of poison more deadly than prussic acid, strychnine or arsenic\\",Perhaps the earliest known appearance of this ever-popular analogy; compare \\"I would rather give a healthy boy or a healthy girl a phial of prussic acid than this novel,\\" describing The Well of Loneliness 404 in 1928 and proposed a bill to restrict the sale of pornography; giving statutory powers of destruction would allow for a much more effective degree of prosecution. The bill was controversial at the time, receiving strong opposition from both Houses of Parliament, and was passed on the assurance by the Lord Chief Justice that it was \\"... intended to apply exclusively to works written for the single purpose of corrupting the morals of youth and of a nature calculated to shock the common feelings of decency in any well-regulated mind.\\" The House of Commons successfully amended it so as not to apply to Scotland, on the grounds that Scottish common law was sufficiently stringent. The Act provided for the seizure and destruction of any material deemed to be obscene, and held for sale or distribution, following information being laid before a \\"court of summary jurisdiction\\" (Magistrates' court). The Act required that following evidence of a common-law offence being committed ‚Äì for example, on the report of a plain-clothes policeman who had successfully purchased the material ‚Äì the court could issue a warrant for the premises to be searched and the material seized. The proprietor then would be called upon to attend court and give reason why the material should not be destroyed. Critically, the Act did not define \\"obscene,\\" leaving this to the will of the courts. Whilst the Act itself did not change, the scope of the work affected by it did. In 1868 Sir Alexander Cockburn, Campbell's successor as Lord Chief Justice, held in an appeal that the test of obscenity was \\"...whether the tendency of the matter charged as obscenity is to deprave and corrupt those whose minds are open to such immoral influences and into whose hands a publication of this sort may fall.\\" This was clearly a major change from Campbell's opinion only ten years before ‚Äì the test now being the effect on someone open to corruption who obtained a copy, not whether the material was intended to corrupt or offend. Cockburn's declaration remained in force for several decades, and most of the high profile seizures under the Act relied on this interpretation. Known as the Hicklin test no cognisance was taken of the literary merit of a book or on the extent of the offending text within the book in question. The widened scope of the original legislation led to the subsequent notorious targeting of now acknowledged classics of world literature by such authors as Zola, James Joyce and D.H. Lawrence plus medical textbooks by such as Havelock Ellis rather than the blatant erotica which was the original target of this law.Cyril Pearl (1955) The Girl With the Swansdown Seat; p. 270 In contrast to England, where actions against obscene literature were the preserve of the magistrates, in America such actions were the responsibility of the Postal Inspection Service, embodied in the federal and state Comstock laws, named after the postal officer and anti-obscenity crusader Anthony Comstock who proved himself officious in the work of suppression both in his official capacity and through his New York Society for the Suppression of Vice.Hyde (1964); pp. 15‚Äì16 The first such law was the Comstock Act, (ch. 258 enacted March 3, 1873) which made it illegal to send any \\"obscene, lewd, and/or lascivious\\" materials through the mail. Twenty-four states passed similar prohibitions on materials distributed within the states. =Modern legislation= This question of whether a book had literary merit eventually prompted a change in the law in both America and the UK. In the United Kingdom the Obscene Publications Act 1959 provided for the protection of \\"literature\\" but conversely increased the penalties against pure \\"pornography.\\" The law defined obscenity and separated it from serious works of art. The new definition read: > [A]n article shall be deemed to be obscene if its effect or (where the > article comprises two or more distinct items) the effect of any one of its > items is, if taken as a whole, such as to tend to deprave and corrupt > persons who are likely, having regard to all relevant circumstances, to > read, see or hear the matter contained or embodied in it. After this piece of legislation questions of the literary merit of the work in question were allowed to be put before the judge and jury as in the Lady Chatterley trial. The publishers of the latter book were found not guilty by the court on the grounds of the literary merit of the book. In later prosecutions of literary erotica under the provisions of the act, however, even purely pornographic works with no apparent literary merit escaped destruction by the authorities. Purely textual pornographic texts, with no hint of libel, ceased to be brought to trial following the collapse of the Inside Linda Lovelace trial in 1976. However, in October 2008, a man was unsuccessfully prosecuted under the Obscene Publications Act (the R v Walker trial) for posting fictional written material to the Internet allegedly describing the kidnap, rape and murder of the pop group Girls Aloud. The First Amendment to the United States Constitution gives protection to written fiction, although the legal presumption that it does not protect obscene literature has never been overcome. Instead, pornography has successfully been defined legally as non-obscene, or \\"obscene\\" been shown to be so vague a term as to be unenforceable. In 1998 Brian Dalton was charged with creation and possession of child pornography under an Ohio obscenity law. The stories were works of fiction concerning sexually abusing children which he wrote and kept, unpublished, in his private journal. He accepted a plea bargain, pleaded guilty and was convicted. Five years later, the conviction was vacated. Importing books and texts across national borders can sometimes be subject to more stringent laws than in the nations concerned. Customs officers are often permitted to seize even merely 'indecent' works that would be perfectly legal to sell and possess once one is inside the nations concerned. Canada has been particularly notorious for such border seizures. Although the year 1857 as well as 1959 legislation outlawed the publication, retail and trafficking of certain types of writings and images, regarded as 'pornographic', and would order the destruction of shop and warehouse stock meant for sale, the private possession of and viewing of pornography has not been prosecuted until recent times.H. Montgomery Hyde A History of Pornography. (1969) London, Heinemann: 14 In some nations, even purely textual erotic literature is still deemed illegal and is also prosecuted.

There is no generally agreed definition of giftedness for either children or adults, but most school placement decisions and most longitudinal studies over the course of individual lives have followed people with IQs in the top 2.5 percent of the population‚Äîthat is, IQs above 130. Definitions of giftedness also vary across cultures. The various definitions of intellectual giftedness include either general high ability or specific abilities. For example, by some definitions an intellectually gifted person may have a striking talent for mathematics without equally strong language skills. In particular, the relationship between artistic ability or musical ability and the high academic ability usually associated with high IQ scores is still being explored, with some authors referring to all of those forms of high ability as \\"giftedness\\", while other authors distinguish \\"giftedness\\" from \\"talent\\". There is still much controversy and much research on the topic of how adult performance unfolds from trait differences in childhood, and what educational and other supports best help the development of adult giftedness. Identification =Overview= The identification of giftedness first emerged after the development of IQ tests for school placement. It has since become an important issue for schools, as the instruction of gifted students often presents special challenges. During the twentieth century, gifted children were often classified via IQ tests; other identification procedures have been proposed but are only used in a minority of cases in most public schools in the English-speaking world. Developing useful identification procedures for students who could benefit from a more challenging school curriculum is an ongoing problem in school administration. Because of the key role that gifted education programs in schools play in the identification of gifted individuals, both children and adults, it is worthwhile to examine how schools define the term \\"gifted\\". = Definitions = For many years, psychometricians and psychologists, following in the footsteps of Lewis Terman in 1916, equated giftedness with high IQ. This \\"legacy\\" survives to the present day, in that giftedness and high IQ continue to be equated in some conceptions of giftedness. Since that early time, however, other researchers (e.g., Raymond Cattell, J. P. Guilford, and Louis Leon Thurstone) have argued that intellect cannot be expressed in such a unitary manner, and have suggested more multifaceted approaches to intelligence. Research conducted in the 1980s and 1990s has provided data which support notions of multiple components to intelligence. This is particularly evident in the reexamination of \\"giftedness\\" by Sternberg and Davidson in their collection of articles Conceptions of Giftedness (1986; second edition 2005). The many different conceptions of giftedness presented, although distinct, are interrelated in several ways. Most of the investigators define giftedness in terms of multiple qualities, not all of which are intellectual. IQ scores are often viewed as inadequate measures of giftedness. This review of contemporary research includes chapters by James Borland, Linda E. Brody, Julian Stanley, Carolyn M. Callahan, Erin M. Miller, Tracy L. Cross, Laurence J. Coleman, John F. Feldhusen, Joan Freeman, Francoys Gagne, Edmund Gordon, Beatrice L. Bridglall, Kurt A. Heller, Christoph Perleth, Tock Keng Lim, Ida Jeltova, Elena L. Grigorenko, Franz J. Monks, Michael W. Katzko, Jonathan A. Plucker, Sasha A. Barab, Sally M. Reis, Joseph S. Renzulli, Nancy M. Robinson, Mark A. Runco, Dean Keith Simonton, Robert J. Sternberg, Rena F. Subotnik, Linda Jarvin, Joyce Van Tassel-Baska, Catya von Karolyi, Ellen Winner, Herbert J. Walberg, Susan J. Paik, Albert Ziegler, and Richard E. Mayer. Motivation, high self-concept, and creativity are key qualities in many of these broadened conceptions of giftedness. Joseph Renzulli's (1978) \\"three ring\\" definition of giftedness is one frequently mentioned conceptualization of giftedness. Renzulli's definition, which defines gifted behaviors rather than gifted individuals, is composed of three components as follows: Gifted behavior consists of behaviors that reflect an interaction among three basic clusters of human traits‚Äîabove average ability, high levels of task commitment, and high levels of creativity. Individuals capable of developing gifted behavior are those possessing or capable of developing this composite set of traits and applying them to any potentially valuable area of human performance. Persons who manifest or are capable of developing an interaction among the three clusters require a wide variety of educational opportunities and services that are not ordinarily provided through regular instructional programs. In Identifying Gifted Children: A Practical Guide, Susan K. Johnsen explains that gifted children all exhibit the potential for high performance in the areas included in the United States' federal definition of gifted and talented students: There is a federal government statutory definition of gifted and talented students in the United States. This definition has been adopted partially or completely by the majority of the individual states in the United States (which have the main responsibility for education policy as compared to the federal government). Most states have a definition similar to that used in the State of Texas: The major characteristics of these definitions are (a) the diversity of areas in which performance may be exhibited (e.g., intellectual, creativity, artistic, leadership, academically), (b) the comparison with other groups (e.g., those in general education classrooms or of the same age, experience, or environment), and (c) the use of terms that imply a need for development of the gift (e.g., capability and potential). Since the late 90s, the development of the brain of people with high IQ scores has been shown to be different to that of people with average IQ scores. A longitudinal study over 6 years has shown that high- IQ children have a thinner cerebral cortex when young, which then grows quickly and becomes significantly thicker than the other children's by the time they became teenagers. = Identification methods = { class=\\"wikitable sortable\\" style=\\"font-size:small\\" align=\\"right\\" summary=\\"Sortable table showing actual I.Q. scores of twelve students on three different I.Q. tests, with students identified by pseudonyms in cited data source.\\" + IQ scores can vary for the same person, so a person does not always belong to the same IQ score range each time the person is tested.

The arbitrary threshold of IQ = 130 is defined by statistical rarity. By convention, the 5% of scores who fall more than two standard deviations from the mean (or more accurately 1.96) are considered atypical.Fisher, Ronald (1925), Statistical Methods for Research Workers, Edinburgh: Oliver and Boyd, p. 47, In the case of intelligence, these 5% are partitioned to both sides of the range of scores, and include the 2.5% who score more than two standard deviations below the mean and the 2.5% who score more than two standard deviations above the mean.Howell, D. C. (1992). Statistical methods for psychology, 3rd ed. PWS-Kent Publishing Co. Because the average of IQ is 100 and its standard deviation is 15, this rule places the threshold for intellectual disability at IQ = 70, and the symmetrical threshold for giftedness at IQ = 130 (rounded).Anastasi, A., & Urbina, S. (1997). Psychological testing, 7th ed. Prentice Hall/Pearson Education.Urbina, S. (2014). Essentials of psychological testing, 2nd ed. John Wiley & Sons Inc.Cronbach, L. J. (1949). Essentials of psychological testing, 2nd ed. Harper. This arbitrary threshold is used by most psychologists in most countries. While IQ testing has the advantage of providing an objective basis for the diagnosis of giftedness, psychologists are expected to interpret IQ scores in the context of all available information: standardized intelligence tests ignore actual achievement and can fail to detect giftedness. For example, a specific learning disorder such as dyslexia or dyspraxia can easily decrease scores on intelligence tests and hide true intellectual ability. In educational settings, many schools in the US use a variety of assessments of students' capability and potential when identifying gifted children. These may include portfolios of student work, classroom observations, achievement tests, and IQ test scores. Most educational professionals accept that no single criterion can be used in isolation to accurately identify a gifted child. One of the criteria used in identification may be an IQ test score. Until the late 1960s, when ‚Äúgiftedness‚Äù was defined solely based on an IQ score, a school district simply set an arbitrary score (usually in the 130 range) and a student either did or did not ‚Äúmake the cut‚Äù. This method is still used by many school districts because it is simple and objective. Although a high IQ score is not the sole indicator of giftedness, usually if a student has a very high IQ, that is a significant indicator of high academic potential. Because of this consideration, if a student scores highly on an IQ test, but performs at an average or below average level academically, school officials may think that this issue warrants further investigation as an example of underachievement. However, scholars of educational testing point out that a test-taker's scores on any two tests may vary, so a lower score on an achievement test than on an IQ test neither necessarily indicates that the test-taker is underachieving nor necessarily that the school curriculum is under challenging. IQ classification varies from one publisher to another. IQ tests have poor reliability for determining test-takers' rank order at higher IQ levels, and are perhaps only effective at determining whether a student is gifted rather than distinguishing among levels of giftedness. The Wechsler tests have a standard score ceiling of 160. Today, the Wechsler child and adult IQ tests are by far the most commonly used IQ tests in hospitals, schools, and private psychological practice. Older versions of the Stanford- Binet test, now obsolete, and the Cattell IQ test purport to yield IQ scores of 180 or higher, but those scores are not comparable to scores on currently normed tests. The Stanford-Binet Third Revision (Form L-M) yields consistently higher numerical scores for the same test-taker than scores obtained on current tests. This has prompted some authors on identification of gifted children to promote the Stanford-Binet form L-M, which has long been obsolete, as the only test with a sufficient ceiling to identify the exceptionally and profoundly gifted, despite the Stanford-Binet L-M never having been normed on a representative national sample. Because the instrument is outdated, current results derived from the Stanford-Binet L-M generate inflated and inaccurate scores. The IQ assessment of younger children remains debated. While many people believe giftedness is a strictly quantitative difference, measurable by IQ tests, some authors on the \\"experience of being\\" have described giftedness as a fundamentally different way of perceiving the world, which in turn affects every experience had by the gifted individual. This view is doubted by some scholars who have closely studied gifted children longitudinally. = Across cultures = Characteristics and attributes associated with giftedness varies across cultures. While intelligence is extremely important in Western and some other cultures, such an emphasis is not consistent throughout the world. For example, in Japan, there is more of a value placed on an individual's motivation and diligence. When Japanese students are given a task, they attribute success to factors like effort, whereas American students tend to attribute success to ability. Similarly, when Japanese students fail, they refer the failure to lack of effort. On the other hand, American students believe failure is due to a lack of ability.Sternberg, Robert J., et al. Explorations in Giftedness. Cambridge University Press, 2011, eclass.hua.gr/modules/document/file.php/OIK268/%CE%A7%CE%B1%CF%81%CE%B9%CF%83%CE%BC%CE%B1%CF%84%CE%B9%CE%BA%CF%8C%CF%84%CE%B7%CF%84%CE%B1/explorations%20of%20giftedness.pdf. There are conceptions in Rural Kenya that identify four types of intelligence: initiative (paro), knowledge and skills (rieko), respect (luoro), and comprehension of how to handle real life problems (winjo). Chan cites the Chinese belief that aspects of giftedness are innate, but that people can become gifted through industriousness, perseverance, and learning. Not all who are intellectually gifted display every characteristic that is seen. There are many reasons gifted students who have various backgrounds are not as successful at Western intelligence/achievement tests: *Not used to answering questions just for the purpose of showing knowledge ‚Äì they must use their knowledge to respond to authentic problems. *May perform poorly on paper-and- pencil tasks in an artificial lab setting. *May perform poorly on a culturally biased test, especially if not their own. *Have test anxiety or suffer from stereotype threat. Many traits that demonstrate intellectual giftedness are identified across a multitude of cultures, such as: *Displaying advanced reasoning and creative thinking, generating ideas beyond the norm *Resourceful and adaptable *Strongly motivated to understand the world *Well developed vocabulary in native language *Learns concepts quickly, and builds/develops these concepts *Strong sense of justice and morality *Displays leadership skills in various ways, such as persuasion, taking initiative, and leading by example *Comprehending and using humor beyond their age Developmental theory Gifted children may develop asynchronously: their minds are often ahead of their physical growth, and specific cognitive and emotional functions are often developed differently (or to differing extents) at different stages of development. One frequently cited example of asynchronicity in early cognitive development is Albert Einstein, who was delayed in speech, but whose later fluency and accomplishments belied this initial delay. Psychologist and cognitive scientist Steven Pinker theorized that, rather than viewing Einstein's (and other famously gifted late-talking individuals) adult accomplishments as existing distinct from, or in spite of, his early language deficits, and rather than viewing Einstein's lingual delay itself as a \\"disorder\\", it may be that Einstein's genius and his delay in speaking were developmentally intrinsic to one another. It has been said that gifted children may advance more quickly through stages established by post-Freudian developmentalists such as Jean Piaget. Gifted individuals also experience the world differently, resulting in certain social and emotional issues. Francoy Gagne's (2000) Differentiated Model of Giftedness and Talent (DMGT) is a developmental theory that distinguishes giftedness from talent, offering explanation on how outstanding natural abilities (gifts) develop into specific expert skills (talents).Colangelo, N., & Davis, G. (2003).Handbook of Gifted Education. Boston: Pearson education, Inc. According to DMGT theory, \\"one cannot become talented without first being gifted, or almost so\\".http://www.curriculumsupport.education.nsw.gov.au/policies/gats/assets/pdf/poldmgt2000rtcl.pdf There are six components that can interact in countless and unique ways that foster the process of moving from having natural abilities (giftedness) to systematically developed skills. These components consist of the gift (G) itself, chance (C), environmental catalyst (EC), intrapersonal catalyst (IC), learning/practice (LP) and the outcome of talent (T). It is important to know that (C), (IC), and (EC) can facilitate but can also hinder the learning and training of becoming talented. The learning/practice is the moderator. It is through the interactions, both environmental and intrapersonal that influence the process of learning and practice along with/without chance that natural abilities are transformed into talents.  Multiple intelligences theory  Multiple intelligences has been associated with giftedness or overachievement of some developmental areas (Colangelo, 2003). Multiple intelligences has been described as an attitude towards learning, instead of techniques or strategies (Cason, 2001). Howard Gardner proposed in Frames of Mind (Gardner 1983/1994) that intellectual giftedness may be present in areas other than the typical intellectual realm. The concept of multiple intelligences (MI) makes the field aware of additional potential strengths and proposes a variety of curricular methods. Gardner argued that there are eight intelligences, or different areas in which people assimilate or learn about the world around them: interpersonal, intrapersonal, bodily-kinesthetic, linguistic, logical- mathematical, musical, naturalistic, and spatial-visual. The most common criticism of Gardner's MI theory is \\"the belief by scholars that each of the seven multiple intelligences is in fact a cognitive style rather than a stand- alone construct\\". Others consider the theory not to be sufficiently empirical. This perspective has also been criticized on the grounds that it is ad hoc: that Gardner is not expanding the definition of the word \\"intelligence\\", but rather denies the existence of intelligence as traditionally understood, and instead uses the word \\"intelligence\\" where other people have traditionally used words like \\"ability\\" and \\"aptitude\\". Identification of gifted students with MI is a challenge since there is no simple test to give to determine giftedness of MI. Assessing by observation is potentially most accurate, but potentially highly subjective. MI theory can be applied to not only gifted students, but it can be a lens through which all students can be assessed. This more global perspective may lead to more child-centered instruction and meet the needs of a greater number of children (Colangelo, 2003).  Characteristics  Generally, gifted or advanced students learn more quickly, deeply, and broadly than their peers. They may talk early, learn to read early and progress at the same level as normal children who are significantly older. Gifted students also tend to demonstrate high reasoning ability, creativity, curiosity, a large vocabulary, and an excellent memory. They can often master concepts with few repetitions. They may also be perfectionistic, and frequently question authority. Some have trouble relating to or communicating with their peers because of disparities in vocabulary size (especially in the early years), personality, interests, and motivation. As children, they may prefer the company of older children or adults. Teachers may notice that gifted students tend to hover around them more than the other students. This is because gifted students sometimes do not think that they can relate to the students their own age, so they try and communicate with the teacher. Giftedness is frequently not evenly distributed throughout all intellectual spheres. One gifted student may excel in solving logic problems yet be a poor speller. Another may be able to read and write at a far above-average level yet have trouble with mathematics. It is possible that there are different types of giftedness with their own unique features, just as there are different types of developmental delay. Giftedness may become noticeable in individuals at different points of development. While early development (i.e. speaking or reading at a very young age) usually comes with giftedness, it is not a determinant factor of giftedness.  Savantism  Savants are individuals who perform exceptionally in a single field of learning. More often savant and savantism describes people with a single field of learning well beyond what is considered normal, even among the gifted community. This is also labelled as idiot savant, a term that has been mentioned as early as the eighteenth century. Autistic savantism refers to the exceptional abilities occasionally exhibited by people with autism or other pervasive developmental disorders. These often comes with below-age-level functioning in most, if not all areas of skilled performance. The term was introduced in a 1978 article in Psychology Today describing this condition. It is also proposed that there are savants with normal or superior IQ such as those with Asperger syndrome, who demonstrate special abilities involving numbers, mathematics, mechanical, and spatial skills.  Gifted minority students in the United States  The majority of students enrolled in gifted programs are White; Black and Hispanic students constitute a smaller proportion than their enrollment in school.Taylor, Lorraine S. and Catharine R. Whittaker. Bridging Multiple Worlds: Case Studies of Diverse Educational Communities. Allyn and Bacon, 2003. For example, statistics from 1993 indicate that in the U.S., Black students represented 16.2% of public school students, but only constituted 8.4% of students enrolled in gifted education programs. Similarly, while Hispanic students represented 9% of public school students, these students only represented 4.7% of those identified as gifted. However, Asian students make up only 3.6% of the student body, yet constitute 14% in the gifted programs. Poor students are also underrepresented in gifted programs, even more than Black and Hispanic students are. In their 2004 study, ‚ÄúAddressing the Achievement Gap Between Minority and Nonminority Children by Increasing Access to Gifted Programs‚Äù Olszewski-Kubilius et al. write that minority students are ‚Äúless likely to be nominated by teachers as potential candidates for gifted programs and, if nominated, are less likely to be selected for the program, particularly when such traditional measures as I.Q. and achievement tests are used for identification.‚Äù This underrepresentation of such students in gifted programs is attributed to a multiplicity of factors including cultural bias of testing procedures, selective referrals and educator bias, and a reliance on deficit-based paradigms. To address the inequities in assessment procedures, researchers suggest the use of multiple tests and alternative methods of testing, such as performance-based assessment measures, oral-expressiveness measures as well as non-verbal ability assessments (such as Naglieri Nonverbal Abilities Tests (NNAT) or Raven's Matrix Analogies Tests).Lee, Seon-Young, Olszewski-Kubilius, Peternel. \\"Follow-Up with students after 6 years of participation in project EXCITE.\\" The Gifted Child Quarterly. Cincinnati: 2009. 53.2. p 137 According to 2013-2014 data collected by the Office of Civil Rights of the Department of Education, White students have more opportunities and exposure to attending schools that offer gifted and talented education programs (GATE) than racial and ethnic minority students, specifically Black and Latino students. Data collected by the Office of Civil Rights department of the Department of Education also reveal that racial/ethnic minority students are underrepresented in gifted and talented education programs. Forty-nine percent of all students enrolled in schools that offer GATE programs are White. Whereas 42% of all students enrolled in schools that offer GATE programs are Latino and Black. Thus revealing that white people have more opportunities to being a part of a school that offers GATE programs. The issue is within these GATE programs 29% of the students are Latino and Black and 57% are White (U.S. Department of Education, 2016).U.S. Department of Education, Office of Civil Rights. (2016). Key Data Highlights on Equity and Opportunity Gaps in our Nation‚Äôs Public Schools. Retrieved from http://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ocr/docs/2013-14-first-look.pdf These proportions of student representation are as expected based on differences in population-level IQ scores. Weinstein's (2002) suggests that some teachers recommend racial minority students ‚Äì with the exception to Asian students ‚Äì to special education and remedial classes more often than gifted and talented classes due to teacher expectancy biases placed on racial minority students. Teachers expectations of their students‚Äô academic performance influences how students perceive themselves. If a teacher expects more success academically from specific students, those students are prone to displaying behavior and work ethic that will set them apart from others in a positive light. Whereas if a teacher only expects bare minimum from his or her students, those students will merely do what is expected of them (Weinstein, 2002).Weinstein, R. S. (2002). Reaching higher: The power of expectations in schooling. Cambridge, Mass: Harvard University Press. Racial minority students who are perceived as being disadvantaged from their peers in regards to socioeconomic status tend to have less supportive relations with their teachers (Fitzpatrick, 2015). Due to this lack of support, teachers do not expect these disadvantaged students to go above and beyond, therefore they are often overlooked when it's time for gifted and talented education program nominations. Research suggests that teacher expectancy bias can also be diminish by matching the racial demographics of students to that of teachers. Gershenson and colleagues (2016) found that non-Black teachers held low expectations of their black students specifically in relation to black male students and math. Whereas, Black teachers held high expectations to black male students in regards to math. This finding suggests that racial diversity in our educators is positive step toward diminishing teacher expectancy bias. Weinstein and colleagues (1991) aimed to change the low expectations attached to racial minority students of an urban high school that placed many Black and Latino students in remedial programs rather than college preparatory or honor classes. The study aimed to prepare these racial minority students for college level academic work while attending high school. With positive teacher attitudes toward students and greater teacher self-efficacy, the students who were once on track to being recommended for remedial classes where performing at advanced academic levels after 2 years of intervention. They were also more heavily involved in leadership roles at their high school. This study supports the claim that teacher expectancy contributes to how a student sees him or herself in regards to achievements (Weinstein et al., 1991). Gifted students of color experience success when multicultural content is incorporated in the curriculum and furthermore when the curriculum itself is designed to be culturally and linguistically compatible. A culturally diverse curriculum and instruction encourages gifted minority students to experience a sense of belonging and validation as scholars. Furthermore, the educator's role in this process is significant as Lee et al. argue that \\"[t]eacher awareness and understanding of students' racial and cultural differences and their ability to incorporate multicultural perspectives into curricular content and instructional techniques may counter gifted minority students' discomfort in being one of the few minority students in gifted programs.‚Äù  Twice- exceptional  The term twice-exceptional was coined by James J. Gallagher to denote students who are both gifted and have disabilities. In other words, twice-exceptional students are those who have two special needs. For instance, they might have gifted learning needs and a learning disability. Or, they may be a gifted learner and have a developmental disability, such as autism spectrum disorder. People have known about twice-exceptional students for thirty years; however, identification and program strategies remain ambiguous. These students represent a unique challenge for the educational system. Teachers and educators will need to make special accommodations for their learning deficits (such as remediation), yet adapt the curriculum to meet their advanced learning needs (for instance, through acceleration or enrichment). Twice-exceptional students are considered to be at risk because they are hidden within the general population of their educational environment, and often viewed as either underachievers or average learners. Early identification and intervention is critical; however, giftedness in the twice-exceptional population is often identified later than in the average population as it is masked by the disability. The disabilities may include auditory processing weaknesses, sensory motor integration issues, visual perceptual difficulties, spatial disorientation, dyslexia, and attention deficits. Recognition of learning difficulties among the gifted is made extremely difficult by virtue of their ability to compensate. Among the signs that the student may be twice-exceptional are apparent inconsistencies between abilities and results, deficits in short-term memory and attention, and negative behaviors such as being sarcastic, negative, or aggressive.Shenfield, T. (2014). \\"Twice Exceptional: When Your Child is Both Gifted and Learning Disabled\\" Advanced Psychology A child prodigy who demonstrates qualities to be twice-exceptional may encounter additional difficulties. With insight at a young age, it is possible for them to be constantly aware of the risk of failure. This can be detrimental to their emotional state and academic achievement. If a child comprehends a subject well, but due to a developmental disorder receives poor grades in a subject, the child may have difficulty understanding why there is little success in that subject.Ganry-Tardy, Marie- No√´lle. ‚ÄúWatching Prodigies for the Dark Side.‚Äù Scientific American, 1 Apr. 2005, www.scientificamerican.com/article/watching-prodigies-for-th/.  Social and emotional issues  = Isolation = Social isolation is a common trait in gifted individuals, especially those with no social network of gifted peers. In order to gain popularity, gifted children will often try to hide their abilities to win social approval. Strategies include underachievement (discussed below) and the use of less sophisticated vocabulary when among same-age peers than when among family members or other trusted individuals. Some believe that the isolation experienced by gifted individuals is not caused by giftedness itself, but by society's response to giftedness and to the rarity of peers. Plucker and Levy have noted that, \\"in this culture, there appears to be a great pressure for people to be 'normal' with a considerable stigma associated with giftedness or talent.\\" To counteract this problem, gifted education professionals recommend creating a peer group based on common interests and abilities. The earlier this occurs, the more effective it is likely to be in preventing isolation. Research suggests that gifted adolescents might have deficiencies in social valuation, mentalization, and social adaptive learning. =Perfectionism= Perfectionism, while considered to have many positive aspects, can be another issue for gifted individuals. It is encouraged by the fact that gifted individuals tend to be easily successful in much of what they do. Healthy perfectionism refers to having high standards, a desire to achieve, conscientiousness, or high levels of responsibility. It is likely to be a virtue rather than a problem, even if gifted children may have difficulty with healthy perfectionism because they set standards that would be appropriate to their mental age (the level at which they think), but they cannot always meet them because they are bound to a younger body, or the social environment is restrictive. In such cases, outsiders may call some behavior perfectionism, while for the gifted this may be their standard. It has been said that perfectionism \\"becomes desirable when it stimulates the healthy pursuit of excellence.\\" Some believe that perfectionism can be unhealthy. Unhealthy perfectionism stems from equating one's worth as a human being to one's achievements, and the simultaneous belief that any work less than perfect is unacceptable and will lead to criticism. Because perfection in the majority of human activities is neither desirable, nor possible, this cognitive distortion creates self-doubt, performance anxiety and ultimately procrastination. The unhealthy perfectionism can be triggered or further exaggerated by parents, siblings or classmates with good or ill intentions. Parents are usually proud and will extensively praise the gifted child. On the other hand, siblings, comrades, and school bullies may generally become jealous or envious of the intellectual ease of the gifted child and tease him or her about any minor imperfection in his or her work, strength, clothes, appearance, or behavior. Either approach‚Äîpositive reinforcement from parents or negative reactions from siblings and comrades for minor flaws‚Äîmay push gifted children into equating their worth amongst their peers to their own abilities; thus, any imperfection could be viewed as a serious defect in themselves. This unhealthy perfectionism can be further exaggerated when the child counters bullying with the same tactics (i.e., insulting the less exceptional abilities of others), thus creating further disdain in himself for low or even average performance. There are many theories that try to explain the correlation between perfectionism and giftedness. Perfectionism can become a problem as it frustrates and inhibits achievements. D. E. Hamachek identified six specific, overlapping types of behavior associated with perfectionism. They include:Schuler, P. (2002). Perfectionism in Gifted Children and Adolescents. In M. Neihart, S. M. Reis, N. M. Robinson, & S. M. Moon (Eds.). The Social and Emotional Development of Gifted Children (pp. 71-79). Waco, Texas: Prufrock Press, Inc. * Depression * A nagging \\"I should\\" feeling * Shame and guilt feelings * Face-saving behavior * Shyness and procrastination * Self- deprecation. =Underachievement= Underachievement is a significant issue for gifted learners. There is often a stark gap between the abilities of the gifted individual and their actual accomplishments. Many gifted students will perform extremely well on standardized or reasoning tests, only to fail a class exam. It is estimated that half of gifted children do not perform in school at a level that is up to their abilities. Studies of high school dropouts in the United States estimate that between 18% and 25% of the students who fail to graduate are gifted. This disparity can result from various factors, such as loss of interest in classes that are too easy or negative social consequences of being perceived as smart.Reis, S. M. & Renzulli, J. S. (2004). \\"Current Research on the Social and Emotional Development of Gifted and Talented Students: Good News and Future Possibilities.\\" Psychology in the Schools, 41, published online in Wiley InterScience. Underachievement can also result from emotional or psychological factors, including depression, anxiety, perfectionism, low self esteem, or self-sabotage.Reis, S. M. & McCoach, D. B. (2002). Underachievement in Gifted Students. In M. Neihart, S. M. Reis, N. M. Robinson, & S. M. Moon (Eds.). The Social and Emotional Development of Gifted Children (pp. 81-91). Waco, Texas: Prufrock Press, Inc. An often-overlooked contributor to underachievement is undiagnosed learning differences. A gifted individual is less likely to be diagnosed with a learning disorder than a non-gifted classmate, as the gifted child can more readily compensate for their paucities. This masking effect is dealt with by understanding that a difference of one standard deviation between scores constitutes a learning disability even if all of the scores are above average. Assessments may also fail to identify some gifted students entirely because their underachieving behaviours keep them from being recognized as exceptional. These learners may move with relative ease through school and achieve high grades but they may never learn how to take risks, learn from failure, or develop resilience. They sometimes lack the skills to face the greater academic challenges that present later in school. Some gifted children may not be aware that they are gifted. One apparently effective way to attempt to reverse underachievement in gifted children includes educating teachers to provide enrichment projects based on students‚Äô strengths and interests without attracting negative attention from peers. Other methods include matching the underachiever with an achieving role model, correcting skill deficiencies and ensuring that proper assessments are in place to identify all learning issues with underachieving students. =Depression= It has been thought in the past that there is a correlation between giftedness and depression. This is not an established research finding. As Reis and Renzulli mention, > With the exception of creatively gifted adolescents who are talented in > writing or the visual arts, studies do not confirm that gifted individuals > manifest significantly higher or lower rates or severity of depression than > those for the general population.

There is also no research that points to suicide attempt rates being higher in gifted adolescents than other adolescents.Neihart, M. (2002).

Her disappearance and murder garnered great media coverage throughout the United States and prompted the creation of the Dru Sjodin National Sex Offender Public Registry.  Murder  At 4:00 p.m. on Saturday, November 22, 2003, Sjodin, a 22-year-old college student at the University of North Dakota and Gamma Phi Beta sorority member, finished her shift at the Victoria's Secret store located in the Columbia Mall in Grand Forks, North Dakota. After shopping for and purchasing a new purse from Marshall Field's, Sjodin left the mall and began walking to her 1994 Oldsmobile Cutlass. During this time, Sjodin was speaking with her boyfriend, Chris Lang, on her cell phone. Ten minutes into their conversation, Lang reports Sjodin was saying \\"Okay, okay,\\" before the call abruptly ended. Lang suspected that the call was just simply dropped and because Sjodin didn't give any sense of urgency, Lang thought nothing of it. About three hours later, Lang received another call from her cell phone, but heard only static and the sound of buttons being pressed. It was reported by authorities this second phone call originated somewhere near Fisher, Minnesota, but that has remained unsubstantiated. With this second call and Sjodin not showing up at her other job at the El Roco nightclub, there was concern for her whereabouts. A week later, on December 1, a suspect, 50-year-old registered level-3 sex offender Alfonso Rodriguez Jr. (born February 18, 1953), was arrested in connection with Sjodin's disappearance. Perpetrator Alfonso Rodriguez Jr. was the son of migrant farm workers Dolores and Alfonso Rodriguez Sr., who traveled between Crystal City, Texas, and Minnesota and then decided to settle in 1963 in Crookston, Minnesota. He admitted to using many drugs during his youth and committed his first sexual assault with a knife when he was 21 by attempting to rape a woman he asked to give him a ride home. Rodriguez had been released from prison May 1, 2003, after serving a 23-year prison term for rape, aggravated assault and kidnapping a woman. Rodriguez had also previously pleaded guilty to rape and was convicted multiple times for rape. He had a long criminal record that included repeated sexual assaults against women. He was released as a Minnesota Level 3 sex offender which meant he was highly likely to reoffend. =Police investigation= According to police reports, Rodriguez admitted being near the Columbia Mall the night Sjodin disappeared, allegedly viewing the film Once Upon a Time in Mexico at the Columbia Mall Cinema 4. However, that movie was not playing at that cinema or any other theater in the area. The police also found receipts of purchases that Rodriguez had made at several stores near the mall including one receipt for a knife which he had purchased at a nearby Menards store. Rodriguez apparently had two tool kit knives that could be purchased at only a particular home center store which was about one mile from the mall, but they were not purchased the day Sjodin disappeared and a purchase date for the knives was never established. Police found a tool kit knife in Rodriguez's car that was soaking in some type of cleaning solution inside a rear wheel well. Police also found a woman's shoe and a knife in the car that had blood on it that matched Sjodin's DNA. Sjodin's body was recovered on April 17, 2004, just west of Crookston, Minnesota, when deep snow drifts began to melt. Crookston is also where Rodriguez lived with his mother. Sjodin's body was found partially nude and face down in a ravine. Her hands were tied behind her back and she had been beaten, stabbed, sexually assaulted, and had several lacerations including a five-and-a-half inch cut on her neck. A rope was also tied around her neck and remnants of a shopping bag were found under the rope, suggesting that a bag had been placed on her head. The medical examiner concluded that she had either died as a result of the major neck wound, from suffocation, or from exposure to the elements. Thousands of people had helped search for Sjodin, and hundreds attended her funeral. =Trial and sentencing= The trial was held in federal court because Sjodin had been taken across state lines. This meant that Rodriguez was eligible to receive the death penalty if convicted, a possibility not allowed under North Dakota or Minnesota law, as neither states have the death penalty. It was the first death penalty case in a century to take place in North Dakota. U.S. Attorney Drew Wrigley and Assistant U.S. Attorneys Keith Reisenauer and Norman Anderson prosecuted the case against Rodriguez. On August 30, 2006, Rodriguez was convicted in federal court of the murder of Dru Sjodin, and on September 22, 2006, the jury recommended that he receive the death penalty. On February 8, 2007, Rodriguez was formally sentenced to death by U.S District Judge Ralph Erickson. He is imprisoned at United States Penitentiary, Terre Haute, Terre Haute, Indiana. Judge Erickson arranged that Rodriguez would be executed in South Dakota. Rodriguez later admitted his guilt in a death row interview with Dr. Michael Welner on June 28, 2013. In October 2011, defense attorneys filed a federal habeas corpus motion claiming that Rodriguez is mentally disabled.  Legacy  Legislation dubbed \\"Dru's Law\\", which set up the Dru Sjodin National Sex Offender Public Registry, was passed in 2006 and signed into law by President George W. Bush. In 2004, a scholarship in Sjodin's name was set up at the University of North Dakota. Dru Sjodin Memorial Scholarship A memorial garden for Sjodin opened in her hometown of Pequot Lakes, Minnesota, and another is planned for the UND campus.

It is also used in Heretic, Hexen: Beyond Heretic, Strife: Quest for the Sigil, Hacx: Twitch 'n Kill, Freedoom, and other games produced by licensees. It was created by John Carmack, with auxiliary functions written by Mike Abrash, John Romero, Dave Taylor, and Paul Radek. Originally developed on NeXT computers, it was ported to DOS for Doom's initial release and was later ported to several game consoles and operating systems. The source code to the Linux version of Doom was released to the public under a license that granted rights to non- commercial use on December 23, 1997, followed by the Linux version of Doom II about a week later on December 29, 1997. The source code was later re-released under the GNU General Public License on October 3, 1999.The Doom source code - released in 1997, now under the GNU General Public License from Id Software's FTP Site The Doom source code from 3ddownloads.com - released in 1997, now under the GNU General Public License The dozens of unofficial Doom source ports that have been created since then allow Doom to run on previously unsupported operating systems and sometimes radically expand the engine's functionality with new features. Although the engine renders a 3D space, that space is projected from a two-dimensional floor plan. The line of sight is always parallel to the floor, walls must be perpendicular to the floors, and it is not possible to create multi-level structures or sloped areas (floors and ceilings with different angles). Despite these limitations, the engine represented a technological leap from id's previous Wolfenstein 3D engine. The Doom engine was later renamed to \\"id Tech 1\\" in order to categorize it in a list of id Software's long line of game engines. Game world The Doom engine separates rendering from the rest of the game. The graphics engine runs as fast as possible, but the game world runs at 35 frames per second regardless of the hardware, so multiple players can play against each other using computers of varying performance. Level structure A simple setup demonstrating how Doom represents levels internally Map view in editor Viewed from the top down, all Doom levels are actually two-dimensional, demonstrating one of the key limitations of the Doom engine: room-over-room is not possible. This limitation, however, has a silver lining: a \\"map mode\\" can be easily displayed, which represents the walls and the player's position, much like the first image to the right. =Basic objects= The base unit is the vertex, which represents a single 2D point. Vertices (or \\"vertexes\\" as they are referred to internally) are then joined to form lines, known as \\"linedefs\\". Each linedef can have either one or two sides, which are known as \\"sidedefs\\". Sidedefs are then grouped together to form polygons; these are called \\"sectors\\". Sectors represent particular areas of the level. =Sectors= Each sector contains a number of properties: a floor height, ceiling height, light level, a floor texture and a ceiling texture. To have a different light level in a particular area, for example, a new sector must be created for that area with a different light level. One-sided linedefs therefore represent solid walls, while two-sided linedefs represent bridge lines between sectors. =Sidedefs= Sidedefs are used to store wall textures; these are completely separate from the floor and ceiling textures. Each sidedef can have three textures; these are called the middle, upper and lower textures. In one-sided linedefs, only the middle texture is used for the texture on the wall. In two-sided linedefs, the situation is more complex. The lower and upper textures are used to fill the gaps where adjacent sectors have different floor and ceiling heights: lower textures are used for steps, for example. The sidedefs can have a middle texture as well, although most do not; this is used to make textures hang in mid air. For example, when a transparent bar texture is seen forming a cage, this is an example of a middle texture on a two-sided linedef. Binary space partitioning Doom makes use of a system known as binary space partitioning (BSP). A tool is used to generate the BSP data for a level beforehand. This process can take quite some time for a large level. It is because of this that it is not possible to move the walls in Doom; while doors and lifts move up and down, none of them ever move sideways. The level is divided up into a binary tree: each location in the tree is a \\"node\\" which represents a particular area of the level (with the root node representing the entire level). At each branch of the tree there is a dividing line which divides the area of the node into two subnodes. At the same time, the dividing line divides linedefs into line segments called \\"segs\\". At the leaves of the tree are convex polygons, where further division of the level is not needed. These convex polygons are referred to as subsectors (or \\"SSECTORS\\"), and are bound to a particular sector. Each subsector has a list of segs associated with it. The BSP system sorts the subsectors into the right order for rendering. The algorithm is fairly simple: #Start at the root node. #Draw the child nodes of this node recursively. The child node closest to the camera is drawn first using a Scanline algorithm. This can be found from looking at which side of the node's dividing line the camera is on. #When a subsector is reached, draw it. The process is complete when the whole column of pixels is filled (i.e., there are no more gaps left). This ordering ensures that no time is used drawing objects that are not visible and as a result maps can become very large without any speed penalty. Rendering =Drawing the walls= All of the walls in Doom are drawn vertically; it is because of this that it is not possible to properly look up and down. It is possible to perform a form of look up/down via \\"y-shearing\\", and many modern Doom source ports do this, as well as later games that use the engine, such as Heretic. Essentially this works by moving the horizon line up and down within the screen, in effect providing a \\"window\\" on a taller viewable area. By moving the window up and down, it is possible to give the illusion of looking up and down. However, this will distort the view the further up and down the player looks. The Doom engine renders the walls as it traverses the BSP tree, drawing subsectors by order of distance from the camera so that the closest segs are drawn first. As the segs are drawn, they are stored in a linked list. This is used to clip other segs rendered later on, reducing overdraw. This is also used later to clip the edges of sprites. Once the engine reaches a solid (1-sided) wall at a particular x ordinate, no more lines need to be drawn at that area. For clipping the engine stores a \\"map\\" of areas of the screen where solid walls have been reached. This allows far away parts of the level which are invisible to the player to be clipped completely. The Doom graphic format stores the wall textures as sets of vertical columns; this is useful to the renderer, which essentially renders the walls by drawing many vertical columns of textures. =Floor and ceiling= The system for drawing floors and ceilings (\\"flats\\") is less elegant than that used for the walls. Flats are drawn with a flood fill-like algorithm. Because of this, it is sometimes possible if a bad BSP builder is used to get \\"holes\\" where the floor or ceiling bleeds down to the edges of the screen. This is also the reason that if the player travels outside of the level using the noclip cheat the floors and ceilings will appear to stretch out from the level over the empty space. The floor and ceiling are drawn as \\"visplanes\\". These represent horizontal runs of texture, from a floor or ceiling at a particular height, light level and texture (if two adjacent sectors have exactly the same floor, these can get merged into one visplane). Each x position in the visplane has a particular vertical line of texture which is to be drawn. Because of this limit of drawing one vertical line at each x position, it is sometimes necessary to split visplanes into multiple visplanes. For example, consider viewing a floor with two concentric squares. The inner square will vertically divide the surrounding floor. In that horizontal range where the inner square is drawn, two visplanes are needed for the surrounding floor. This leads to one of Doom's classic limitations which frustrated many mappers for a long time. Doom contained a static limit on the number of visplanes; if exceeded, a \\"visplane overflow\\" would occur, causing the game to exit to DOS with one of two messages, \\"No more visplanes!\\" or \\"visplane overflow (128 or higher)\\". The easiest way to invoke the visplane limit is a large checkerboard floor pattern; this creates a large number of visplanes. As the segs are rendered, visplanes are also added, extending from the edges of the segs towards the vertical edges of the screen. These extend until they reach existing visplanes. Because of the way this works, the system is dependent on the fact that segs are rendered in order by the overall engine; it is necessary to draw nearer visplanes first, so that they can \\"cut off\\" by others further away. If unstopped, the floor or ceiling will \\"bleed out\\" to the edges of the screen, as previously described. Eventually, the visplanes form a \\"map\\" of particular areas of the screen in which to draw particular textures. While visplanes are constructed essentially from vertical \\"strips\\", the actual low level rendering is performed in the form of horizontal \\"spans\\" of texture. After all the visplanes have been constructed, they are converted into spans which are then rendered to the screen. This appears to be a trade off: it is easier to construct visplanes as vertical strips, but because of the nature of how the floor and ceiling textures appear it is easier to draw them as horizontal strips. =Things (sprites)= Each sector within the level has a linked list of things stored in that sector. As each sector is drawn the sprites are placed into a list of sprites to be drawn. If not within the field of view these are ignored. The edges of sprites are clipped by checking the list of segs previously drawn. Sprites in Doom are stored in the same column based format as the walls are, which again is useful for the renderer. The same functions which are used to draw walls are used to draw sprites as well. While subsectors are guaranteed to be in order, the sprites within them are not. Doom stores a list of sprites to be drawn (\\"vissprites\\") and sorts the list before rendering. Far away sprites are drawn before close ones. This causes some overdraw but usually this is negligible. There is a final issue of middle textures on 2-sided lines, used in transparent bars for example.

Common examples are denominations of a religion, ethnic identity, class, or region for citizens of a state and factions of a political movement. The ideological underpinnings of attitudes and behaviours labelled as sectarian are extraordinarily varied. Members of a religious, national or political group may believe that their own salvation, or the success of their particular objectives, requires aggressively seeking converts from other groups; likewise, adherents of a given faction may believe that the achievement of their own political or religious goals requires the conversion or purging of dissidents within their own sect. Sometimes a group that is under economic or political pressure will kill or attack members of another group which it regards as responsible for its own decline. It may also more rigidly define the definition of orthodox belief within its particular group or organization, and expel or excommunicate those who do not support this newfound clarified definition of political or religious orthodoxy. In other cases, dissenters from this orthodoxy will secede from the orthodox organization and proclaim themselves as practitioners of a reformed belief system, or holders of a perceived former orthodoxy. At other times, sectarianism may be the expression of a group's nationalistic or cultural ambitions, or exploited by demagogues. The phrase \\"sectarian conflict\\" usually refers to violent conflict along religious or political lines such as the conflicts between Nationalists and Unionists in Northern Ireland (religious and class-divisions may play major roles as well). It may also refer to general philosophical, political disparity between different schools of thought such as that between Shia and Sunni Muslims. Non-sectarians espouse that free association and tolerance of different beliefs are the cornerstone to successful peaceful human interaction. They espouse political and religious pluralism. While sectarianism is often labelled as 'religious' and/ or 'political', the reality of a sectarian situation is usually much more complex. In its most basic form sectarianism has been defined as, 'the existence, within a locality, of two or more divided and actively competing communal identities, resulting in a strong sense of dualism which unremittingly transcends commonality, and is both culturally and physically manifest.' Sectarianization Various scholars have made a differentiation between \\"sectarianism\\" and \\"sectarianization\\". While the first describes prejudice, discrimination, and hatred between subdivisions within a group, e.g. based on their religious or ethnic identity, the latter describes how sectarianism is mobilized by political actors due to ulterior political motives.Hashemi, Nader, and Danny Postel. \\"Introduction: The Sectarianization Thesis.\\" In Sectarianization: Mapping the New Politics of the Middle East, edited by Nader Hashemi and Danny Postel. New York: Oxford University Press, 2017. pp. 3, 5, 6, 10. .Weiss, Max. In the Shadow of Sectarianism : Law, Shi\`ism, and the Making of Modern Lebanon. Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 2010. pp. 3, 4, 9‚Äì11, 11‚Äì128, 127, 129, 229. . The use of the word sectarianism to explain sectarian violence and its upsurge in i.e. the Middle East is insufficient, as it does not take into account complex political realities. In the past and present, religious identities have been politicized and mobilized by state actors inside and outside of the Middle East in pursuit of political gain and power. The term sectarianization conceptualizes this notion. Sectarianization is an active, multi-layered process and a set of practices, not a static condition, that is set in motion and shaped by political actors pursuing political goals.Hashemi, Nader. The West's \\"intellectually lazy\\" obsession with sectarianism. Interview by Emran Feroz. Qantara, October 17, 2018. While religious identity is salient in the Middle East and has contributed to and intensified conflicts across the region, it is the politicization and mobilization of popular sentiments around certain identity markers (\\"sectarianization\\") that explains the extent and upsurge of sectarian violence in the Middle East. The Ottoman Tanzimat, European colonialism and authoritarianism are key in the process of sectarianization in the Middle East.Makdisi, Ussama Samir. The Culture of Sectarianism: Community, History, and Violence in Nineteenth-Century Ottoman Lebanon. California: University of California Press, 2000. p. 2. Makdisi, Ussama Samir. \\"Understanding Sectarianism.\\" ISIM Newsletter 8, no.1 (2001), p. 19. =The Ottoman Tanzimat and European colonialism= The Ottoman Tanzimat, a period of Ottoman reform (1839‚Äì1876), emerged out of an effort to resist European intervention by emancipating the non-Muslim subjects of the empire, as European powers had started intervening in the region \\"on a explicitly sectarian basis\\". The resulting growth of tensions and the conflicting interpretations of the Ottoman reform led to the 1840s sectarian violence in Mount Lebanon and the massacres of 1860. This resulted in \\"a system of local administration and politics explicitly defined on a narrow communal basis\\". Sectarianism arose from the confrontation between European colonialism and the Ottoman Empire and was used to mobilize religious identities for political and social purposes. In the decades that followed, a colonial strategy and technique to assert control and perpetuate power used by the French during their mandate rule of Lebanon was divide and rule. The establishment of the Ja'fari court in 1926, facilitated by the French as a \\"quasi-colonial institution\\", provided Shi'a Muslims with sectarian rights through the institutionalization of Shia Islam, and hence gave rise to political Shi‚Äôism. The \\"variation in the institutionalization of social welfare across different sectarian communities forged and exacerbated social disparities\\".Cammett, Melani. Compassionate Communalism: Welfare and Sectarianism in Lebanon. Ithaca and London: Cornell University Press, 2014. p. 40. . Additionally, with the standardization, codification and bureaucratization of Shia Islam, a Shi‚Äôi collective identity began to form and the Shi‚Äôi community started to \\"practice\\" sectarianism. \\"The French colonial state contributed to rendering the Shi‚Äòi community in Jabal ‚ÄòAmil and Beirut more visible, more empowered, but also more sectarian, in ways that it had never quite been before.\\" This fundamental transformation, or process of sectarianization, led by the French created a new political reality that paved the way for the \\"mobilization\\" and \\"radicalization\\" of the Shi‚Äôa community during the Lebanese civil war.Henley, Alexander D. M. \\"Review of Max Weiss, In the Shadow of Sectarianism: Law, Shi øism and the Making of Modern Lebanon.\\" New Middle Eastern Studies, 1 (2011). p. 2 =Authoritarian regimes= In recent years, authoritarian regimes have been particularly prone to sectarianization. This is because their key strategy of survival lies in manipulating sectarian identities to deflect demands for change and justice and preserve and perpetuate their power. Christian communities, and other religious and ethnic minorities in the Middle East, have been socially, economically and politically excluded and harmed primarily by regimes that focus on \\"securing power and manipulating their base by appeals to Arab nationalism and/or to Islam\\".Ellis, Kail C. \\"Epilogue.\\" In Secular Nationalism and Citizenship in Muslim Countries: Arab Christians in Muslim Countries, edited by Kail C. Ellis. London: Palgrave Macmillan, 2018. p. 211. . An example of this is the Middle Eastern regional response to the Iranian revolution of 1979. Middle Eastern dictatorships backed by the United States, especially Saudi Arabia, feared that the spread of the revolutionary spirit and ideology would affect their power and dominance in the region. Therefore, efforts were made to undermine the Iranian revolution by labeling it as a Shi‚Äôa conspiracy to corrupt the Sunni Islamic tradition. This was followed by a rise of anti-Shi‚Äôa sentiments across the region and a deterioration of Shi'a-Sunni relations, impelled by funds from the Gulf states. Therefore, the process of sectarianization, the mobilization and politicization of sectarian identities, is a political tool for authoritarian regimes to perpetuate their power and justify violence. Western powers indirectly take part in the process of sectarianization by supporting undemocratic regimes in the Middle East. As Nader Hashemi asserts: > The U.S. invasion of Iraq; the support of various Western governments for > the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, which commits war crime upon war crime in Yemen > and disseminates poisonous sectarian propaganda throughout the Sunni world; > not to mention longstanding Western support for highly repressive dictators > who manipulate sectarian fears and anxieties as a strategy of control and > regime survival ‚Äì the \\"ancient hatreds\\" narrative [between Sunnis and > Shi‚Äôas] washes this all away and lays the blame for the region πs problems on > supposedly trans-historical religious passions. It πs absurd in the extreme > and an exercise in bad faith. Religious sectarianism In 1871, New York's Orange Riots were incited by Irish Protestants. 63 citizens, mostly Irish Catholics, were massacred in the resulting police-action. Wherever people of different religions live in close proximity to each other, religious sectarianism can often be found in varying forms and degrees. In some areas, religious sectarians (for example Protestant and Catholic Christians) exist peacefully side-by-side for the most part, although these differences have resulted in violence, death, and outright warfare as recently as the 1990s. Probably the best-known example in recent times were The Troubles. Catholic-Protestant sectarianism has also been a factor in U.S. presidential campaigns. Prior to John F. Kennedy, only one Catholic (Al Smith) had ever been a major party presidential nominee, and he had been solidly defeated largely because of claims based on his Catholicism. JFK chose to tackle the sectarian issue head-on during the West Virginia primary, but that only sufficed to win him barely enough Protestant votes to eventually win the presidency by one of the narrowest margins ever. Within Islam, there has been conflict at various periods between Sunnis and Shias; Shi'ites consider Sunnis to be damned, due to their refusal to accept the first Caliph as Ali and accept all following descendants of him as infallible and divinely guided. Many Sunni religious leaders, including those inspired by Wahhabism and other ideologies have declared Shias to be heretics or apostates. =Europe= Painting of the St. Bartholomew's Day Massacre, an event in the French Wars of Religion Long before the Reformation, dating back to the 12th century, there has been sectarian conflict of varying intensity in Ireland. This sectarianism is connected to a degree with nationalism. This has been particularly intense in Northern Ireland since the early 17th century plantation of Ulster under James I, with its religious and denominational sectarian tensions lasting to the present day in some forms. This has translated to parts of Great Britain, most notably Liverpool, and the West Central Scotland, the latter being very close geographically to Northern Ireland, and where some fans of the two best-known football clubs, Celtic (long been affiliated with Catholics) and Rangers (long affiliated with Protestants), indulge in provocative and sectarian behaviour. Historically, some Catholic countries once persecuted Protestants as heretics. For example, the substantial Protestant population of France (the Huguenots) was expelled from the kingdom in the 1680s following the revocation of the Edict of Nantes. In Spain, the Inquisition sought to root out crypto-Jews but also crypto- Muslims (moriscos); elsewhere the Papal Inquisition held similar goals. In most places where Protestantism is the majority or \\"official\\" religion, there have been examples of Catholics being persecuted. In countries where the Reformation was successful, this often lay in the perception that Catholics retained allegiance to a 'foreign' power (the Papacy or the Vatican), causing them to be regarded with suspicion. Sometimes this mistrust manifested itself in Catholics being subjected to restrictions and discrimination, which itself led to further conflict. For example, before Catholic Emancipation was introduced with the Roman Catholic Relief Act 1829, Catholics were forbidden from voting, becoming MP's or buying land in Ireland. Ireland was deeply scarred by religious sectarianism following the Protestant Reformation as tensions between the native Catholic Irish and Protestant settlers from Britain led to massacres and attempts at ethnic cleaning by both sides during the Irish Rebellion of 1641, Cromwellian conquest of Ireland, Irish Rebellion of 1798 and the Home Rule Crisis of 1912. The invasion of Ireland by English parliamentarian forces under Oliver Cromwell in 1659 was notoriously brutal and witnessed the widespread ethnic cleansing of the native Irish. The failure of the Rebellion of 1798, which sought to unite Protestants and Catholics for an independent Ireland, helped cause more sectarian violence in the island, most infamously the Scullabogue Barn massacre, in which Protestants were burned alive in County Wexford. The British response, which included the public executions of dozens of suspected rebels in Dunlavin and Carnew, along with other violence perpetrated by all sides, ended the hope that Protestants and Catholics could work together for Ireland. After the Partition of Ireland in 1922, Northern Ireland witnessed decades of intensified conflict, tension, and sporadic violence between the dominant Protestant majority and the Catholic minority, which in 1969 finally erupted into 25 years of violence known as ‚ÄúThe Troubles‚Äù between Irish Republicans whose goal is a United Ireland and Ulster loyalists who wish for Northern Ireland to remain a part of the United Kingdom. The conflict was primarily fought over the existence of the Northern Irish state rather than religion, though sectarian relations within Northern Ireland fueled the conflict. However, religion is commonly used as a marker to differentiate the two sides of the community. The Catholic minority primarily favour the nationalist, and to some degree, republican, goal of unity with the Republic of Ireland, while the Protestant majority favour Northern Ireland continuing the union with Great Britain. The sack of Magdeburg by Catholic army in 1631. Of the 30,000 Protestant citizens, only 5,000 survived. Northern Ireland has introduced a Private Day of Reflection, since 2007, to mark the transition to a post-[sectarian] conflict society, an initiative of the cross-community Healing Through Remembering organization and research project. The civil wars in the Balkans which followed the breakup of Yugoslavia in the 1990s have been heavily tinged with sectarianism. Croats and Slovenes have traditionally been Catholic, Serbs and Macedonians Eastern Orthodox, and Bosniaks and most Albanians Muslim. Religious affiliation served as a marker of group identity in this conflict, despite relatively low rates of religious practice and belief among these various groups after decades of communism. =Africa= Over 1,000 Muslims and Christians were killed in the sectarian violence in the Central African Republic in 2013‚Äì2014.\\"Central African Republic: Ethnic cleansing and sectarian killings\\". Amnesty International. February 12, 2014. Nearly 1 million people, a quarter of the population, were displaced.\\"Eight dead in Central African Republic capital, rebel leaders flee city\\". Reuters. January 26, 2014. =Australia= Sectarianism in Australia was a historical legacy from the 18th, 19th and 20th centuries, between Catholics of mainly Celtic heritage and Protestants of mainly English descent. It has largely disappeared in the 21st century. In the late 20th and early 21st centuries, religious tensions are more centered on Muslim immigrants amid the backdrop of Salafist or Islamist terrorism. =Asia= Battle of rival ascetics in 1567. Hindu-Muslim conflicts provoked the creation of a military order of Hindu ascetics in India. Japan For the violent conflict between Buddhist sects in Japan, see Japanese Buddhism. Pakistan Pakistan, one of the largest Muslim countries the world, has seen serious Shia-Sunni sectarian violence. Almost 80 - 85% of Pakistan's Muslim population is Sunni, and another 10 - 20% are Shia. However, this Shia minority forms the second largest Shia population of any country, larger than the Shia majority in Iraq. In the last two decades, as many as 4,000 people are estimated to have died in sectarian fighting in Pakistan, 300 in 2006. Among the culprits blamed for the killing are Al Qaeda working \\"with local sectarian groups\\" to kill what they perceive as Shi'a apostates. Sri Lanka Most Muslims in Sri Lanka are Sunnis. There are a few Shia Muslims too from the relatively small trading community of Bohras. Divisiveness is not a new phenomenon to Beruwala. Sunni Muslims in the Kalutara district are split in two different sub groups. One group, known as the Alaviya sect, historically holds its annual feast at the Ketchimalai mosque located on the palm-fringed promontory adjoining the fisheries harbour in Beruwala. It is a microcosm of the Muslim identity in many ways. The Galle Road that hugs the coast from Colombo veers inland just ahead of the town and forms the divide. On the left of the road lies China Fort, the area where some of the wealthiest among Sri Lankans Muslims live. The palatial houses with all modern conveniences could outdo if not equal those in the Colombo 7 sector. Most of the wealthy Muslims, gem dealers, even have a home in the capital, not to mention property. Strict Wahabis believe that all those who do not practise their form of religion are heathens and enemies. There are others who say Wahabism's rigidity has led it to misinterpret and distort Islam, pointing to the Taliban as well as Osama bin Laden. What has caused concern in intelligence and security circles is the manifestation of this new phenomenon in Beruwala. It had earlier seen its emergence in the east. =Middle East= The Al-Askari Mosque, one of the holiest sites in Shia Islam, after the first attack by Wahhabi affiliated Al-Qaeda in Iraq in 2006 Ottoman Empire Sultan Selim the Grim, regarding the Shia Qizilbash as heretics, reportedly proclaimed that \\"the killing of one Shiite had as much otherworldly reward as killing 70 Christians.\\" In 1511, a pro-Shia revolt known as ≈ûahkulu Rebellion was brutally suppressed by the Ottomans: 40,000 were massacred on the order of the sultan.H.A.R. Gibb & H. Bowen, \\"Islamic society and the West\\", i/2, Oxford, 1957, p. 189  Iran  = Overview = Sectarianism in Iran has been existing for centuries, dating back to the Islamic conquer of the country in early Islamic years and continued throughout the Iranian history upon now. During the Safavid Dynasty's reign sectarianism started to play an important role in shaping the path of the country. During the Safavid rule between 1501 and 1722, Shiism started to evolve and became established as the official state religion, leading to the creation of the first religiously legitimate government since the occultation of the Twelfth imam. This pattern of sectarianism prevailed throughout the Iranian history. The approach that sectarianism has taken after the Iranian 1979 revolution is shifted compared to the earlier periods. Never before the Iranian 1979 revolution did the Shiite leadership gain as much authority. Due to this change, the sectarian timeline in Iran can be divided in pre- and post-Iranian 1979 revolution where the religious leadership changed course. = Pre-1979 Revolution = Shiism has been an important factor in shaping the politics, culture and religion within Iran, long before the Iranian 1979 revolution.During the Safavid Dynasty Shiism was established as the official ideology. The establishment of Shiism as an official government ideology opened the doors for clergies to benefit from new cultural, political and religious rights which were denied prior to the Safavid ruling. During the Safavid Dynasty Shiism was established as the official ideology. The Safavid rule allowed greater freedom for religious leaders. By establishing Shiism as the state religion, they legitimised the religious authority. After this power establishment, religious leaders started to play a crucial role within the political system but remained socially and economically independent. The monarchial power balance during the Safavid ere changed every few years, resulting in a changing limit of power of the clergies. The tensions concerning power relations of the religious authorities and the ruling power eventually played a pivotal role in the 1906 constitutional revolution which limited the power of the monarch, and increased the power of religious leaders. The 1906 constitutional revolution involved both constitutionalist and anti-constitutionalist clergy leaders. Individuals such as Sayyid Jamal al-Din Va'iz were constitutionalist clergies whereas other clergies such as Mohammed Kazem Yazdi were considered anti-constitutionalist. The establishment of a Shiite government during the Safavid rule resulted in the increase of power within this religious sect. The religious power establishment increased throughout the years and resulted in fundamental changes within the Iranian society in the twentieth century, eventually leading to the establishment of the Shiite Islamic Republic of Iran in 1979. = Post-1979 Revolution: Islamic Republic of Iran = The Iranian 1979 revolution led to the overthrow of the Pahlavi dynasty and the establishment of the Islamic Government of Iran. The governing body of Iran displays clear elements of sectarianism which are visible within different layers of its system. The 1979 revolution led to changes in political system, leading to the establishment of a bureaucratic clergy-regime which has created its own interpretation of the Shia sect in Iran.Religious differentiation is often used by authoritarian regimes to express hostility towards other groups such as ethnic minorities and political opponents. Authoritarian regimes can use religion as a weapon to create an \\"us and them\\" paradigm. This leads to hostility amongst the involved parties and takes place internally but also externally. A valid example is the suppression of religious minorities like the Sunnis and Baha-√≠s. With the establishment of the Islamic Republic of Iran sectarian discourses arose in the Middle-East as the Iranian religious regime has attempted and in some cases succeeded to spread its religious and political ideas in the region. These sectarian labeled issues are politically charged. The most notable Religious leaders in Iran are named Supreme-leaders. Their role has proved to be pivotal in the evolvement of sectarianism within the country and in the region. The following part discusses Iran's supreme-leadership in further detail. = Ruhollah Khomeini and Ali Khamenei = During the Iran-Iraq war, Iran's first supreme-leader, Ayatollah Khomeini called for the participation of all Iranians in the war. His usage of Shia martyrdom led to the creation of a national consensus. In the early aftermath of the Iranian 1979 revolution, Khomeini started to evolve a sectarian tone in his speeches. His focus on Shiism and Shia Islam grew which was also implemented within the changing policies of the country. In one of his speeches Khomeini quoted: \\"the Path to Jerusalem passes through Karbala.\\" His phrase lead to many different interpretations, leading to turmoil in the region but also within the country. From a religious historic viewpoint, Karbala and Najaf which are both situated in Iraq, serve as important sites for Shia Muslims around the world. By mentioning these two cities, Khomeini led to the creation of Shia expansionism. Khomeini's war with the Iraqi Bath Regime had many underlying reasons and sectarianism can be considered as one of the main reasons. The tensions between Iran and Iraq are of course not only sectarian related, but religion is often a weapon used by the Iranian regime to justify its actions. Khomeini's words also resonated in other Arab countries who had been fighting for Palestinian liberation against Israel. By naming Jerusalem, Khomeini expressed his desire for liberating Palestine from the hands of what he later often has named \\"the enemy of Islam.\\" Iran has supported rebellious groups throughout the region. Its support for Hamas and Hezbollah has resulted in international condemnation. This desire for Shia expansionism did not disappear after Khomeini's death. It can even be argued that sectarian tone within the Islamic Republic of Iran has grown since then. The Friday prayers held in Tehran by Ali Khamenei can be seen as a proof of growing sectarian tone within the regime. Khamenei's speeches are extremely political and sectarian. He often mentions extreme wishes such as the removal of Israel from the world map and fatwas directed towards those opposing the regime. = Regional tensions and Iran's role = The political approach that the Islamic Republic of Iran has taken in the previous decades has led to the increase of tensions in the region. World leaders from around the world have criticised the political ambitions of Iran and have condemned its involvement and support for opposition groups such as Hezbollah. By using religion as an instrument, Iran has expanded its authority to neighbouring countries. An important figure in this process of power and ideology expansion was the major general of Iran's Quds Force, the foreign arm of the IRGC, Qasem Soleimani. Soleimani was assassinated in Iraq by an American drone in January 2020 leading to an increase of tension between the United States of America and Iran. Soleimani was responsible for strengthening Iran's ties with foreign powers such as Hezbollah in Lebanon, Syria's al-Assad and Shia militia groups in Iraq. Soleimani was seen as the number-one commander of Iran's foreign troops and played a crucial role in the spread of Iran's ideology in the region. According to President Donald Trump, Soleimani was the worlds most wanted terrorist and had to be assassinated in order to bring more peace to the Middle-East region but also the rest of the world. Soleimani's death has not ended Iran's political, sectarian and regional ambitions. Iran remains a key power in expending ideologies to its neighbouring countries. Shiism is used by the regime to justify its actions. But it can be concluded that Iran's usage of religion is an excuse to spread its political power regionally. Iraq Sunni Iraqi insurgency and foreign Sunni terrorist organizations who came to Iraq after the fall of Saddam Hussein have targeted Shia civilians in sectarian attacks. Following the civil war, the Sunnis have complained of discrimination by Iraq's Shia majority governments, which is bolstered by the news that Sunni detainees were allegedly discovered to have been tortured in a compound used by government forces on November 15, 2005. This sectarianism has fueled a giant level of emigration and internal displacement. The Shia majority oppression by the Sunni minority has a long history in Iraq, after the fall of the Ottoman Empire, the British imposed upon Iraq a rule of Sunni Hashemite monarchy that suppressed various uprisings against its rule by the Christian Assyrians, Kurds, Yazidis and Shi'ites. After the monarchy was overthrown, Iraq was ruled by the de jure secular Baathist Party, while de facto a minority Sunni absolute rule that discriminated against and persecuted the Shia majority. Syria Although sectarianism has been described as one of the characteristic features of the Syrian civil war, the narrative of sectarianism already had its origins in Syria‚Äôs past. = Ottoman rule = Wounded civilians arrive at a hospital in AleppoThe hostilities that took place in 1850 in Aleppo and subsequently in 1860 in Damascus, had many causes and reflected long-standing tensions. However, scholars have claimed that the eruptions of violence can also be partly attributed to the modernizing reforms, the Tanzimat, taking place within the Ottoman Empire, who had been ruling Syria since 1516. The Tanzimat bring about equality between Muslims and non-Muslims living in the Ottoman Empire. This caused the non-Muslims to gain privileges and influence. In addition to this growing position of non-Muslims through the Tanzimat reforms, the influence of European powers also came mainly to the benefit of the Christians, Druzes and Jews. In the silk trade business, European powers formed ties with local sects. They usually opted for a sect that adhered to a religion similar to the one in their home countries, thus not Muslims. These developments caused new social classes to emerge, consisting of mainly Christians, Druzes and Jews. These social classes stripped the previously existing Muslim classes of their privileges. The involvement of another foreign power, though this time non-European, also had its influence on communal relations in Syria. Ibrahim Pasha of Egypt ruled Syria between 1831 and 1840. His divide-and-rule strategy contributed to the hostilities between the Druze and Maronite community, by arming the Maronite Christians. However, it is noteworthy to mention that different sects did not fight the others out of religious motives, nor did Ibrahim Pasha aim to disrupt society among communal lines. This can also be illustrated by the unification of Druzes and Maronites in their revolts to oust Ibrahim Pasha in 1840. This goes to show the fluidity of communal alliances and animosities and the different, at times non-religious, reasons that may underline sectarianism. = After Ottoman rule = Before the fall of the Ottoman Empire and the French Mandate in Syria, the Syrian territory had already witnessed massacres on the Maronite Christians, other Christians, Alawites, Shias and Ismailiyas, which had resulted in distrustful sentiments between the members of different sects. In an attempt to protect the minority communities against the majority Sunni population, France, with the command of Henri Gouraud, created five states for the following sects: Armenians, Alawites, Druzes, Maronite Christians and Sunni Muslims. This focus on minorities was new and part of a divide-and-rule strategy of the French, which enhanced and politicized differences between sects. The restructuring by the French caused the Alawite community to advance itself from their marginalized position. In addition to that, the Alawites were also able to obtain a position of power through granting top level positions to family members of the ruling clan or other tribal allies of the Alawite community. During the period 1961‚Äì1980, Syria was not necessarily exclusively ruled by the Alawite sect, but due to efforts of the Sunni Muslim extremist opponents of the Ba‚Äôth regime in Syria, it was perceived as such. The Ba‚Äôath regime was being dominated by the Alawite community, as well as were other institutions of power. As a result of this, the regime was considered to be sectarian, which caused the Alawite community to cluster together, as they feared for their position. This period is actually contradictory as Hafez al-Assad tried to create a Syrian Arab nationalism, but the regime was still regarded as sectarian and sectarian identities were reproduced and politicized. Sectarian tensions that later gave rise to the Syrian civil war, had already appeared in society due to events preceding 1970. For example, President Hafez al-Assad‚Äôs involvement in the Lebanese civil war by giving political aid to Maronite Christians in Lebanon. This was viewed by many Sunny Muslims as an act of treason, which made them link al-Assad‚Äôs actions to his Alawite identity. The Muslim Brothers, a part of the Sunni Muslims, used those tensions towards the Alawites as a tool to boost their political agenda and plans. Several assassinations were carried out by the Muslim Brothers, mostly against Alawites, but also against some Sunni Muslims. The failed assassination attempt on President Hafez al-Assad is arguably the most well-known. Part of the animosity between the Alawites and the Sunni Islamists of the Muslim Brothers is due to the secularization of Syria, which the later holds the Alawites in power to be responsible for. = Syrian Civil War = As of 2015, the majority of the Syrian population consisted of Sunni Muslims, namely two-thirds of the population, which can be found throughout the country. The Alawites are the second largest group, which make up around 10 percent of the population. This makes them a ruling minority. The Alawites were originally settled in the highlands of Northwest Syria, but since the twentieth century have spread to places like Latakia, Homs and Damascus. Other groups that can be found in Syria are Christians, among which the Maronite Christians, Druzes and Twelver Shias. Although sectarian identities played a role in the unfolding of events of the Syrian Civil War, the importance of tribal and kinship relationships should not be underestimated, as they can be used to obtain and maintain power and loyalty. At the start of the protests against President Basher al-Assad in March 2011, there was no sectarian nature or approach involved. The opposition had national, inclusive goals and spoke in the name of a collective Syria, although the protesters being mainly Sunni Muslims. This changed after the protests and the following civil war began to be portrayed in sectarian terms by the regime, as a result of which people started to mobilize along ethnic lines. However, this does not mean that the conflict is solely or primarily a sectarian conflict, as there were also socio-economic factors at play. These socio-economic factors were mainly the result of Basher al-Assad's mismanaged economic restructuring. The conflict has therefore been described as being semi-sectarian, making sectarianism a factor at play in the civil war, but certainly does not stand alone in causing the war and has varied in importance throughout time and place. In addition to local forces, the role of external actors in the conflict in general as well as the sectarian aspect of the conflict should not be overlooked. Although foreign regimes were first in support of the Free Syrian Army, they eventually ended up supporting sectarian militias with money and arms. However, it has to be said that their sectarian nature did not only attract these flows of support, but they also adopted a more sectarian and Islamic appearance in order to attract this support. Yemen = Introduction = In Yemen, there have been many clashes between Salafis and Shia Houthis.Salafi-Houthi clashes in Yemen kill 14 retrieved 6 February 2012 According to The Washington Post, \\"In today‚Äôs Middle East, activated sectarianism affects the political cost of alliances, making them easier between co-religionists. That helps explain why Sunni-majority states are lining up against Iran, Iraq and Hezbollah over Yemen.\\" Historically, divisions in Yemen along religious lines (sects) are less intense than those in Pakistan, Lebanon, Syria, Iraq, Saudi Arabia, and Bahrain. Most political forces in Yemen are primarily characterized by regional interests and not by religious sectarianism. Regional interests are, for example, the north‚Äôs proximity to the Hejaz, the south‚Äôs coast along the Indian ocean trade route, and the southeast's oil and gas fields. Yemen‚Äôs northern population consists for a substantial part of Zaydis, and its southern population predominantly of Shafi‚Äôis. Hadhramaut in Yemen‚Äôs southeast has a distinct Sufi Ba‚ÄôAlawi profile. = Ottoman era, 1849‚Äì1918 = Sectarianism reached the region once known as Arabia Felix with the 1911 Treaty of Daan. It divided the Yemen Vilayet into an Ottoman controlled section and an Ottoman-Zaydi controlled section. The former dominated by Sunni Islam and the latter by Zaydi-Shia Islam, thus dividing the Yemen Vilayet along Islamic sectarian lines. Yahya Muhammad Hamid ed-Din became the ruler of the Zaidi community within this Ottoman entity. Before the agreement, inter- communal battles between Shafi‚Äôis and Zaydis never occurred in the Yemen Vilayet. After the agreement, sectarian strife still did not surface between religious communities. Feuds between Yemenis were nonsectarian in nature, and Zaydis attacked Ottoman officials not because they were Sunnis. Following the collapse of the Ottoman Empire, the divide between Shafi‚Äôis and Zaydis changed with the establishment of the Kingdom of Yemen. Shafi‚Äôi scholars were compelled to accept the supreme authority of Yahya Muhammad Hamid ed-Din, and the army ‚Äúinstitutionalized the supremacy of the Zaydi tribesman over the Shafi‚Äôis‚Äù. = Unification period, 1918‚Äì1990 = Before the 1990 Yemeni unification, the region had never been united as one country. In order to create unity and overcome sectarianism, the myth of Qahtanite was used as a nationalist narrative. Although not all ethnic groups of Yemen fit in this narrative, such as the Al-Akhdam and the Teimanim. The latter established a Jewish kingdom in ancient Yemen, the only one ever created outside Palestine. A massacre of Christians, executed by the Jewish king Dhu Nuwas, eventually led to the fall of the Homerite Kingdom. In modern times, the establishment of the Jewish state resulted in the 1947 Aden riots, after which most Teimanim left the country during Operation Magic Carpet. Conflicting geopolitical interests surfaced during the North Yemen Civil War (1962-1970). Wahhabist Saudi Arabia and other Arab monarchies supported Muhammad al-Badr, the deposed Zaydi imam of the Kingdom of Yemen. His adversary, Abdullah al-Sallal, received support from Egypt and other Arab republics. Both international backings were not based on religious sectarian affiliation. In Yemen however, President Abdullah al-Sallal (a Zaydi) sidelined his vice-president Abdurrahman al-Baidani (a Shaffi'i) for not being a member of the Zaydi sect. Shaffi'i officials of North Yemen also lobbied for \\"the establishment of a separate Shaffi'i state in Lower Yemen\\" in this period. = Contemporary Sunni-Shia rivalry = According to Lisa Wedeen, the perceived sectarian rivalry between Sunnis and Shias in the Muslim world is not the same as Yemen‚Äôs sectarian rivalry between Salafists and Houthis. Not all supporters of Houthi‚Äôs Ansar Allah movement are Shia, and not all Zaydis are Houthis. Although most Houthis are followers of Shia‚Äôs Zaydi branch, most Shias in the world are from the Twelver branch. Yemen is geographically not in proximity of the so-called Shia Crescent. To link Hezbollah and Iran, whose subjects are overwhelmingly Twelver Shias, organically with Houthis is exploited for political purposes. Saudi Arabia emphasized an alleged military support of Iran for the Houthis during Operation Scorched Earth. The slogan of the Houthi movement is 'Death to America, death to Israel, a curse upon the Jews'. This is a trope of Iran and Hezbollah, so the Houthis seem to have no qualms about a perceived association with them. = Tribes and political movements = Tribal culture in the southern regions has virtually disappeared through policies of the People's Democratic Republic of Yemen. However, Yemen's northern part is still home to the powerful tribal confederations of Bakil and Hashid. These tribal confederations maintain their own institutions without state interference, such as prisons, courts, and armed forces. Unlike the Bakils, the Hashids adopted Salafist tenets, and during the Sa‚Äôdah War (2004-2015) sectarian tensions materialized. Yemen‚Äôs Salafists attacked the Zaydi Mosque of Razih in Sa‚Äôdah and destroyed tombs of Zaydi imams across Yemen. In turn, Houthis attacked Yemen‚Äôs main Salafist center of Muqbil bin Hadi al-Wadi'I during the Siege of Dammaj. Houthis also attacked the Salafist Bin Salman Mosque and threatened various Teimanim families. Members of Hashid‚Äôs elite founded the Sunni Islamist party Al-Islah and, as a counterpart, Hizb al-Haqq was founded by Zaydis with the support of Bakil's elite. Violent non-state actors Al-Qaeda, Ansar al-Sharia and Daesh, particularly active in southern cities like Mukalla, fuel sectarian tendencies with their animosity towards Yemen's Isma'ilis, Zaydis, and others. An assassination attempt in 1995 on Hosni Mubarak, executed by Yemen‚Äôs Islamists, damaged the country's international reputation. The war on terror further strengthened Salafist-jihadist groups impact on Yemen‚Äôs politics. The 2000 USS Cole bombing resulted in US military operations on Yemen's soil. Collateral damage caused by cruise missiles, cluster bombs, and drone attacks, deployed by the United States, compromised Yemen's sovereignty. = Ali Abdullah Saleh's reign = Ali Abdullah Saleh is a Zaydi from the Hashid‚Äôs Sanhan clan and founder of the nationalist party General People's Congress. During his decades long reign as head of state, he used Sa'dah's Salafist's ideological dissemination against Zaydi's Islamic revival advocacy. In addition, the Armed Forces of Yemen used Salafists as mercenaries to fight against Houthis. Though, Ali Abdullah Saleh also used Houthis as a political counterweight to Yemen's Muslim Brotherhood. Due to the Houthis persistent opposition to the central government, Upper Yemen was economically marginalized by the state. This policy of divide and rule executed by Ali Abdullah Saleh worsened Yemen's social cohesion and nourished sectarian persuasions within Yemen‚Äôs society. Following the Arab Spring and the Yemeni Revolution, Ali Abdullah Saleh was forced to step down as president in 2012. Subsequently, a complex and violent power struggle broke out between three national alliances: (1) Ali Abdullah Saleh, his political party General People's Congress, and the Houthis; (2) Ali Mohsen al-Ahmar, supported by the political party Al-Islah; (3) Abdrabbuh Mansur Hadi, supported by the Joint Meeting Parties. According to Ibrahim Fraihat, ‚ÄúYemen‚Äôs conflict has never been about sectarianism, as the Houthis were originally motivated by economic and political grievances. However, in 2014, the regional context substantially changed‚Äù. The Houthi takeover in 2014-2015 provoked a Saudi-led intervention, strengthening the sectarian dimension of the conflict. Hezbollah's Hassan Nasrallah heavily criticized the Saudi intervention, bolstering the regional Sunni-Shia geopolitical dynamic behind it. Saudi Arabia The Saudi government has often been viewed as an active oppressor of Shia Muslims because of the funding of the Wahabbi ideology which denounces the Shia faith. Prince Bandar bin Sultan, Saudi ambassador to the United States, stated: \\"The time is not far off in the Middle East when it will be literally 'God help the Shia'. More than a billion Sunnis have simply had enough of them.\\"\\"Iraq crisis: How Saudi Arabia helped Isis take over the north of the country,\\" The Independent, 13 July 2014.

Lebanon =Overview= Sectarianism in Lebanon has been formalized and legalized within state and non-state institutions and is inscribed in its constitution. The foundations of sectarianism in Lebanon date back to the mid-19th century during Ottoman rule. It was subsequently reinforced with the creation of the Republic of Lebanon in 1920 and its 1926 constitution, and in the National Pact of 1943. In 1990, with the Taif Agreement, the constitution was revised but did not structurally change aspects relating to political sectarianism. The dynamic nature of sectarianism in Lebanon has prompted some historians and authors to refer to it as \\"the sectarian state par excellence\\" because it is an amalgam of religious communities and their myriad sub-divisions, with a constitutional and political order to match. =Historical background= According to various historians, sectarianism in Lebanon is not simply an inherent phenomena between the various religious communities there. Rather, historians have argued that the origins of sectarianism lay at the \\"intersection of nineteenth-century European colonialism and Ottoman modernization\\". The symbiosis of Ottoman modernization (through a variety of reforms) and indigenous traditions and practices became paramount in reshaping the political self-definition of each community along religious lines. The Ottoman reform movement launched in 1839 and the growing European presence in the Middle East subsequently led to the disintegration of the traditional Lebanese social order based on a hierarchy that bridged religious differences. Nineteenth-century Mount Lebanon was host to competing armies and ideologies and for \\"totally contradictory interpretations of the meaning of reform\\" (i.e. Ottoman or European). This fluidity over reform created the necessary conditions for sectarianism to rise as a \\"reflection of fractured identities\\" pulled between enticements and coercions of Ottoman and European power. As such, the Lebanese encounter with European colonization altered the meaning of religion in the multi-confessional society because it \\"emphasized sectarian identity as the only viable marker of political reform and the only authentic basis for political claims.\\" As such, during both Ottoman rule and later during the French Mandate, religious identities were deliberately mobilized for political and social reasons. =The Lebanese political system= Lebanon gained independence on 22 November 1943. Shortly thereafter, the National Pact was agreed upon and established the political foundations of modern Lebanon and laid the foundations of a sectarian power-sharing system (also known as confessionalism) based on the 1932 census. The 1932 census is the only official census conducted in Lebanon: with a total population of 1,046,164 persons, Maronites made up 33.57%, Sunnis made up 18.57% and Shiites made up 15.92% (with several other denominations making up the remainder). The National Pact served to reinforce the sectarian system that had begun under the French Mandate, by formalizing the confessional distribution of the highest public offices and top administrative ranks according to the proportional distribution of the dominant sects within the population. Because the census showed a slight Christian dominance over Muslims, seats in the Chamber of Deputies (parliament) were distributed by a six-to-five ratio favoring Christians over Muslims. This ratio was to be applied to all highest- level public and administrative offices, such as ministers and directors. Furthermore, it was agreed that the President of the Republic would be a Maronite Christian; the Premier of the Council of Ministers would be a Sunni Muslim; the President of the National Assembly would be a Shiite Muslim; and the Deputy Speaker of Parliament a Greek Orthodox Christian. =The Lebanese Civil War, 1975‚Äì1990= During the three decades following independence from the French Mandate, \\"various internal tensions inherent to the Lebanese system and multiple regional developments collectively contributed to the breakdown of governmental authority and the outbreak of civil strife in 1975‚Äù. According to Makdisi, sectarianism reached its peak during the civil war that lasted from 1975‚Äì1990. The militia politics that gripped Lebanon during the civil war represents another form of popular mobilization along sectarian lines against the elite-dominated Lebanese state. Christians began setting up armed militias what they ‚Äúsaw as an attempt by the Palestinian Liberation Organization (PLO) to seize Lebanon ‚Äì those militias would be united under the Lebanese Forces umbrella in 1976‚Äù. Lebanese Sunni groups splintered into armed factions as well, competing against one another and against the Christian militias. The beginning of the Lebanese Civil War dates to 1975, when a Maronite militia opened fire on a bus full of civilians in response to an assassination attempt of a Maronite leader by PLO-affiliated Muslims. On May 31, seven weeks after fighting began between militias, Beirut witnessed its first sectarian massacre in which \\"unarmed civilians were killed simply on the grounds of their religion.\\" Syria entered the conflict in June 1976, in order to avoid a PLO takeover of Lebanon ‚Äì Syria's entry into the war resulted in a de facto division of the country into zones controlled by Syria, the PLO, and Maronite militias. Shi‚Äôa militias were also created, including the formation of Amal in the late 1970s and later when some Amal militants decided to create a more religious Shi‚Äôa militia known as Hezbollah (Party of God). The Lebanese Civil War became a regional dilemma when Israel invaded in 1982 with two avowed aims: destroy the PLO military infrastructure and secure its northern frontier. In March 1989, Prime Minister (and Acting President) General Michel Aoun launched a ‚Äúliberation war‚Äù against the Syrian army with the backing of the PLO and Iraqi president Saddam Hussein. In doing so, General Aoun internationalized the Lebanese crisis by ‚Äúemphasized the destructive role of the Syrian army in the country‚Äù. His decision resulted in multilateral negotiations as well as efforts to strengthen the role of the UN. By 1983, what had begun as an internal war between Lebanese factions had become a regional conflict that drew in Syria, Israel, Iran, Europe and the United States directly - with Iraq, Libya, Saudi Arabia, and the Soviet Union involved indirectly by providing financial support and weaponry to different militias. After fifteen years of war, at least 100,000 Lebanese were dead, tens of thousands had emigrated abroad, and an estimated 900,000 civilians were internally displaced. =The Taif Agreement= After twenty-two days of discussions and negotiations, the surviving members of the 1972 parliament reached an agreement to end the Civil War on October 22, 1989. The Taif Agreement reconfigured the political power-sharing formula that formed that basis of government in Lebanon under the National Pact of 1943. As noted by Eugene Rogan, \\"the terms of Lebanon's political re-construction, enshrined in the Taif [Agreement], preserved many of the elements of the confessional system set up in the National Pact but modified the structure to reflect the demographic realities of modern Lebanon.\\" As such, several key provisions of the National Pact were changed including: it relocated most presidential powers in favor of Parliament and the Council of Ministers and, as such, the Maronite Christian President lost most of his executive powers and only retained symbolic roles; it redistributed important public offices, including those of Parliament, Council of Ministers, general directors, and grade-one posts evenly between Muslims and Christians thereby upsetting the traditional ratio of six to five that favored Christians under the National Pact; it ‚Äúrecognized the chronic instability of confessionalism and called for devising a national strategy for its political demise. It required the formation of a national committee to examine ways to achieve deconfessionalization and the formation of a non-confessional Parliament,\\" which has not yet been implemented to date and it required the disarmament of all Lebanese militias; however, Hezbollah was allowed to retain its militant wing as a ‚Äúresistance force‚Äù in recognition of its fight against Israel in the South. =Spillover from the Syrian conflict= The Syrian conflict which began in 2011 when clashes began between the Assad government and opposition forces has had a profound effect on sectarian dynamics within Lebanon. In November 2013, the United States Institute of Peace published a Peace Brief in which Joseph Bahout assesses how the Syrian crisis has influenced Lebanon's sectarian and political dynamics. Bahout argues that the Syrian turmoil is intensifying Sunni-Shia tensions on two levels: ‚Äúsymbolic and identity-based on the one hand, and geopolitical or interest based, on the other hand.\\" Syria's conflict has profoundly changed mechanisms of inter-sectarian mobilization in Lebanon: interest-based and ‚Äúpolitical‚Äù modes of mobilization are being transformed into identity-based and ‚Äúreligious‚Äù modes. Bahout notes that this shift is likely due to how these communities are increasingly perceiving themselves as defending not only their share of resources and power, but also their very survival. As the conflict grows more intense, the more the sectarian competition is internalized and viewed as a zero-sum game. Perceptions of existential threat exist among both the Shiite and Sunni communities throughout Lebanon: the continuation of the Syrian conflict will likely increase these perceptions over time and cause terrorism. There are notable divisions within the Lebanese community along sectarian lines regarding the Syrian Civil War. The Shi'ite militant and political organization Hezbollah and its supporters back the Assad government, while many of the country's Sunni communities back the opposition forces. These tensions have played out in clashes between Sunnis and Shi'ites within Lebanon, resulting in clashes and deaths. For instance, clashes in the northern city of Tripoli, Lebanon left three dead when fighting broke out between Assad supporters and opponents. The largest concentration of Syrian refugees, close to one million people as of April 2014, can be found in Lebanon and has resulted in a population increase by about a quarter. According to the United Nations, the massive influx of refugees threatens to upset the ‚Äúalready fragile demographic balance between Shi‚Äôites, Sunnis, Druze, and Christians.‚Äù The Lebanese government faces major challenges for handling the refugee influx, which has strained public infrastructure as Syrians seek housing, food, and healthcare at a time of economic slowdown in Lebanon.

The East German regime had previously used the term \\"German Federal Republic\\" (), which it abbreviated as \\"DBR\\", to refer to West Germany. The most widely used abbreviation for West Germany in the country itself was its ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 country code \\"DE\\", which has remained the country code of reunified Germany. While the English equivalent FRG was used as an IOC country code and a FIFA trigramme, the use of BRD was strongly discouraged by the authorities of the Federal Republic of Germany itself from the 1970s, because it was considered to be a derogatory communist term following its widespread use in East Germany since 1968; thus the term was regarded as a possible expression of an extremist, anti-constitutional and anti-democratic sentiment by West German authorities.Wer BRD sagt, richtet Unheil an, Der Spiegel, 25 September 1978Dialectics, Dogmas, and Dissent: Stories from East German Victims of Human Rights Abuse, John Rodden, Penn State Press, 2010, page xi The term was not banned by law, but its use was discouraged or forbidden in schools in West Germany from the 1970s, and treated as an error.Erlass der Schulbeh√∂rde Schleswig-Holstein, RdErl. vom 4. Oktober 1976 (NBl. KM. Schl.-H. S. 274) As a result of its use by East Germany and the war on the abbreviation by the West German government, far-left terrorists such as the Red Army Faction tended to use the term as a way to attack West Germany; additionally the term \\"BRD\\" has been used by some far-right groups for the same purpose. After German reunification, the country is usually referred to simply as Germany ('), and hence the need for abbreviations is greatly diminished; if an abbreviation is used at all, the uncontroversial standard abbreviation \\"DE\\" for \\"Deutschland\\" is often used. However, since the end of the Cold War the term \\"BRD\\" has lost some of its potency as an insult intended to attack the Federal Republic of Germany, as it was used by East Germany and far-left terrorists such as the Red Army Faction, and the term \\"BRD\\" has been listed in the German dictionary Duden as an \\"unofficial abbreviation\\" for the Federal Republic of Germany since the 1990s,Dudenredaktion (Hrsg.): Duden online, Bibliographisches Institut GmbH, Stichwort ‚ÄûBundesrepublik‚Äú.

History Allied occupation zones in post-war Germany: British (green), Soviet (red), American (orange), French (blue) =Background= The official name was and is Bundesrepublik Deutschland (\\"Federal Republic of Germany\\"). The name, even though in the beginning referring only to the republic established in the Trizone, was to reflect a name for all of Germany, therefore it was particularly to include the term Deutschland (\\"Germany\\"). This corresponded to the spirit of the then West German constitution, the Basic Law, allowing all states or L√§nder, then under Allied control, to join the new Federal Republic. In 1949 the original eleven states in the Trizone and West Berlin did so.The initial states were the following: Baden (south), Bavaria, Bremen, Hamburg, Hesse, Lower Saxony, North Rhine-Westphalia, Rhineland-Palatinate, Schleswig-Holstein, W√ºrttemberg-Baden, and W√ºrttemberg-Hohenzollern. The latter two and the first merged in Baden- W√ºrttemberg in 1952. However the latter was prevented by Allied objection on account of the city being a quadripartite allied occupation area. The Saarland joined with effect from 1 January 1957, while the \\"new states\\" of the East did so with effect from 3 October 1990, including reunited Berlin. Therefore, the term Germany had an importance as part of the official name, which is reflected in the naming conventions which developed in the Cold War. Starting in June 1949 the abbreviation was sometimes used in the Federal Republic of Germany without any special connotations. The initialism BRD began to enter into such regular usage in West German scientific and ministerial circles, that it was added to the western edition of the German language dictionary Duden in 1967.\\\\- Ein Name im Wandel, Helmut Berschin, Olzog, 1979, page 76 The German Democratic Republic at first used the name Westdeutschland or \\"West Germany\\" (abbreviated \\"WD\\") for the Federal Republic of Germany,Deutschland seit 1945: eine dokumentierte gesamtdeutsche Geschichte in der Zeit der Teilung, Gerhart Binder, Seewald, 1969, page 600 but since the 1950s the East German government insisted on calling West Germany Deutsche Bundesrepublik or \\"German Federal Republic\\" (abbreviated \\"DBR\\"),Dokumentation zur Deutschlandfrage, Heinrich Siegler Siegler, 1971, page 46 because they also considered East Germany part of Germany, and thus would not permit the West German government to use the name \\"Germany\\".Der Vertrag von Versailles und seine Folgen f√ºr die Pfalz oder deutsche Sozialdemokraten verraten Deutschland, Reinhard Welz Vermittler Verlag e.K., 2004, page 143 =Use in East Germany= This changed in 1968 with the new constitution of the German Democratic Republic. The communists no longer strove for German reunification, and the name BRD was introduced as a propaganda counter-term to the term DDR, trying to express the equality of the states.Bezeichnungen f√ºr \\"Deutschland\\" in der Zeit der \\"Wende\\": dargestellt an ausgew√§hlten westdeutschen Printmedien, Ute R√∂ding-Lange K√∂nigshausen & Neumann, 1997, page 84 The West would speak of the sogenannte DDR Vom Sogenannten, Der Spiegel, 21 October 1968, page 65 or \\"so-called 'DDR'\\"Facts about Germany: The Federal Republic of Germany, 1959 - Germany (West), page 20 when intending to belittle East German statehood. At that time, the initialism BRD had been adopted by Neues Deutschland, the ruling Socialist Unity Party's daily newspaper,Neues Deutschland, 8 December 1970 while East German official sources adopted that initialism as standard in 1973. The East German decision to abandon the idea of a single German nation was accompanied by omitting the terms Deutschland (\\"Germany\\") and deutsch (\\"German\\") in a number of terms, for example: East German team at the opening ceremony of the 1972 Summer Olympics * The governing National Front of Democratic Germany became the National Front of the German Democratic Republic in 1973W√∂rter und Wortgebrauch in Ost und West: ein rechnergest√ºtztes Korpus-W√∂rterbuch zu Zeitungstexten aus den beiden deutschen Staaten : Die Welt und Neues Deutschland 1949-1974, Manfred W.

DDR international vehicle registration oval, used between 1974 and 1990. Therefore, using the abbreviation BRD fitted perfectly into the official East German policy of downplaying the concept of a united Germany. In 1974, the GDR had replaced the vehicle registration code D, hitherto shared with the Federal Republic, for DDR and demanded that West Germany recognise the division by likewise accepting BRD.Kennzeichen B√Ñ√ÑH, Der Spiegel 12 August 1974 This was rejected by the West, where some motorists displayed bumper stickers with the slogan BRD - Nein Danke! (\\"BRD? No Thanks!\\").Kontroverse Begriffe: Geschichte des √∂ffentlichen Sprachgebrauchs in der Bundesrepublik Deutschland, Georg St√∂tzel, Martin Wengeler Walter de Gruyter, 1995, page 320 Thus in the West the initialism became even more objectionable and using it was often considered either unreflecting or even expressing na√Øve Communist sympathies. As a result, the initialism reached only occasional frequency in West German parlance. In order to be precise West Germans increasingly used the terms Bundesrepublik or Bundesgebiet (\\"Federal Republic\\", or \\"Federal Territory\\") to refer to the country and Bundesb√ºrger (\\"Federal Citizen[s]\\") as to its citizens, with the pertaining adjective bundesdeutsch (federally German). =Opposition to use in West Germany= To distance themselves from the term BRD, until German reunification, the government of the Federal Republic of Germany and media sometimes used the abbreviations BR Deutschland,Konfession und Wahlverhalten in der Bundesrepublik Deutschland, Karl Schmitt, Duncker & Humblot, 1989, page 307 BR-Dt.,Deutschland-Jahrbuch, Volume 2, Klaus Mehnert, Heinrich Schulte Rheinisch-Westf√§lisches Verlagskontor, 1953, page 520 BRDt., Der 17.

Walter Hallstein West Germany had always claimed to be the Germany, and did not like the comparison to DDR, or two separate German states. This claim was also reflected in the Hallstein Doctrine determining its foreign and interior policy until the early 1970s. Named after Walter Hallstein, State secretary at the Foreign Office, this was a key doctrine in the foreign policy of West Germany after 1955, which prescribed that the Federal Republic of Germany would not establish or maintain diplomatic relations with any state that recognised the GDR.The Two Germanies: Rivals struggle for Germany's soul - As worries surface in Bonn about the influx from the East, there are anxieties across Europe about the likely economic and international effects, The Guardian', 15 September 1989 Although this changed after 1973, with the Federal Republic no longer asserting an exclusive mandate over the whole of Germany, West Germany only established de facto diplomatic relations with East Germany.

On 31 May 1974 the heads of the federal and state governments recommended that the full name should always be used in official publications. In November 1979 the federal government informed the Bundestag that the West German public broadcasters ARD and ZDF agreed not to use the initialism.Stefan Schmidt, \\"Die Diskussion um den Gebrauch der Abk√ºrzung ¬´BRD¬ª\\", in: Aktueller Begriff, Deutscher Bundestag ‚Äì Wissenschaftliche Dienste (ed.), No. 71/09 (4 September 2009) Under the West German federal system, the states were generally responsible for school education, and by the 1970s, some of them had either already recommended omitting the initialism, or, in the case of Bavaria, forbidden it.Rechts um--zum Abitur: der geistige Wandel an deutschen Oberschulen, Michael Preute Ch. Links Verlag, 1995, page 122 Similarly, a decree by the educational authorities in the state of Schleswig-Holstein of 4 October 1976 declared the term to be nicht w√ºnschenswert or \\"undesirable\\". The conference of all the states ministers for school education decided on 12 February 1981 to not print the initialism in books, maps, and atlases for schools. with pupils being required to write Bundesrepublik Deutschland in full and use of the term being deemed an error. The different usages were so ingrained that one could deduce a person's or source's political leaning from the name used for West Germany, with far-left movements in the country using BRD.Kampf dem BRD-Imperialismus, Liga gegen den Imperialismus, 1972, page 30 However, as the Association for the German Language found, this debate on the initialism had little influence on changing the West German parlance with the usage of the initialism - in any event limited - unaffected by the debate. Naming difficulties over Berlin and East Germany Map of divided Berlin, indicating by the broken line at Berlin's western border the territorial redeployment decided by the Allies. A similar ideological question was the question whether to use \\"Berlin (West)\\" (the officially preferred name) or \\"West Berlin\\", and even whether to write \\"West Berlin\\" in German as two hyphenated words - West-Berlin - or as one word - Westberlin.Divided in Unity: Identity, Germany, and the Berlin Police, Andreas Glaeser University of Chicago Press, 2000, page 104 Most Westerners called the Western sectors \\"Berlin\\", unless further distinction was necessary. The West German Federal government initially called West Berlin Gro√ü-Berlin or \\"Greater Berlin\\", but changed this \\"Berlin (West)\\", although it also used the hyphenated \\"West- Berlin\\". However, the East German government commonly referred to it as \\"Westberlin\\". Starting from 31 May 1961, East Berlin was officially called Berlin, Hauptstadt der DDR (Berlin, Capital of the GDR), replacing the formerly used term Democratic Berlin,Architecture, Politics, and Identity in Divided Berlin, Emily Pugh, University of Pittsburgh Press, 2014, page 344 or simply \\"Berlin\\", by East Germany, and \\"Berlin (Ost)\\" by the West German Federal government.

Description In Chapters 1.22-4-11 of his History, Polybius describes this device as a bridge 1.2 m (4 ft) wide and 10.9 m (36 ft) long, with a small parapet on both sides. The engine was probably used in the prow of the ship, where a pole and a system of pulleys allowed the bridge to be raised and lowered. There was a heavy spike shaped like a bird's beak on the underside of the device, which was designed to pierce and anchor into an enemy ship's deck when the boarding bridge was lowered. This allowed a firm grip between the vessels and a route for the Roman legionaries (who serve as specialized naval infantry called marinus) to cross onto and capture the enemy ship. In the 3rd century BCE, Rome was not a naval power, and had little experience in sea combat. Before the First Punic War began in 264 BCE, the Roman Republic had not campaigned outside the Italian Peninsula. The Republic's military strength was in land-based warfare, and its main assets were the discipline and courage of the Roman soldiers. The boarding bridge allowed the Romans to use their infantry advantage at sea, therefore helping to overcome the Carthaginians' superior naval experience and skills. The Romans' application of boarding tactics worked; they won several battles, most notably those of Mylae, Sulci, Tyndaris, and Ecnomus. Despite its advantages, the boarding bridge had a serious drawback: it could not be used in rough seas since the stable connection of two working ships endangered both ships' structures. Thus, when operating in rough conditions the device became useless as a tactical weapon.Wallinga p.77-90 The added weight on the prow may have also compromised the ship's navigability; it has been suggested that this instability led to Rome losing almost two entire fleets during storms in 255 and 249 BCE.Wallinga p.77-90 These losses may have contributed to Rome abandoning the boarding bridge in ship design over time. However, a different analysis suggests that the added weight did not threaten ship stability. JW Bonebakker, formerly Professor of Naval Architecture at TU Delft, used an estimated corvus weight of one ton to conclude that it was \\"most probable that the stability of a quinquereme with a displacement of about would not be seriously upset\\" when the bridge was raised. Regardless of the reasons, it appears that Rome was no longer using the corvus at the end of the First Punic War. As Rome's ship crews became more experienced, Roman naval tactics also improved; accordingly, the relative utility of using the corvus as a weapon may have diminished. The device is not mentioned in period sources after the battle of Ecnomus, and apparently the Battle of the Aegates Islands that decided the war in 241 BCE was won without it. By 36 BCE at the Battle of Naulochus, the Roman navy was using a different kind of device to facilitate boarding attacks, a harpoon and winch system known as the harpax or harpago.  Modern interpretations  The design of the corvus has undergone many transformations throughout history. The earliest suggested modern interpretation of the corvus came in 1649 by German classicist Johann Freinsheim. Freinsheim suggested that the bridge consisted of two parts, one section measuring 24 feet and the second being 12 feet long. The 24-foot section was placed along the prow mast and a hinge connected the smaller 12-foot piece to the mast at the top. This smaller piece would have been the actual gangway as it could swing up and down, and the pestle was attached to the end. Classical scholar and German statesman B.G. Niebuhr ventured to improve the interpretation of the corvus and proposed that the two parts of Freinsheim‚Äôs corvus simply needed to be swapped. By applying the 12-foot side along the prow mast, the 24-foot side could be lowered onto an enemy ship by means of the pulley. German scholar K.F. Haltaus hypothesized that the corvus was a 36-foot-long bridge with the near end braced against the mast via a small oblong notch in the near end that extended twelve feet into the bridge. Haltaus suggested that a lever through the prow mast would have allowed the crew to turn the corvus by turning the mast. A pulley was placed on the top of a 24-foot mast that raised the bridge in order to use the device. German classical scholar Wilhelm Ihne proposed another version of corvus that resembled Freinsheim‚Äôs crane with adjustments in the lengths of the sections of the bridge. His design placed the corvus twelve feet above the deck and had the corvus extend out from the mast a full 36 feet with the base of the near end connected to the mast. The marines on deck would then be forced to climb a 12-foot ladder to access to the corvus. French scholar Emile de St. Denis suggested the corvus featured a 36-foot bridge with the mast hole set 12 feet from the near end. The design suggested by de St. Denis, however, did not include an oblong hole and forced the bridge to travel up and down the mast completely perpendicular to the deck at all times. The next step in this direction occurred in 1956, when historian H.T. Wallinga published his dissertation, ‚ÄúThe Boarding-Bridge of the Romans.‚Äù It suggested a different full-beam design for the corvus, which became the most widely accepted model among scholars for the rest of the twentieth century. Wallinga‚Äôs design included the oblong notch in the deck of the bridge to allow it to rise at an angle by the pulley mounted on the top of the mast. Not everybody, however, has accepted the idea that the Romans invented and used the corvus as a special device. In 1907, William W. Tarn postulated that the corvus never existed. Tarn believed that the weight of the bridge would be too much for the design of the Roman ships to remain upright. He suggested that, once the corvus was raised, the ship would simply roll over and capsize due to the weight added by the corvus. Tarn believed that the corvus was simply an improved version of an already existing grapnel pole that had been used in Greece as early as 413 B.C. Notes References * Wallinga, Herman Tammo (1956).

R. R. Tolkien's hobbit, a fictional race found in some fantasy novels and games. They are often depicted as similar to humans except about half as tall.  Etymology  Originally, halfling comes from the Scots word ', meaning an awkward rustic teenager, who is neither man nor boy, and so half of both. Another word for halfling is hobbledehoy or hobby. This usage of the word pre-dates both The Hobbit and Dungeons & Dragons. The German surname ' has a similar origin.  Other uses The original Dungeons & Dragons box set included hobbits as a race, but later editions began using the name halfling as an alternative to hobbit for legal reasons. Halflings have long been one of the playable humanoid races in Dungeons & Dragons, starting with the 1978 Player's Handbook. Halfling characters have appeared in various tabletop and video games. Some fantasy stories use the term halfling to describe a person born of a human parent and a parent of another race, often a female human and a male elf. Terry Brooks describes characters such as Shea Ohmsford from his Shannara series as a halfling of elf‚Äìhuman parentage. Other fantasy works, such as J. R. R. Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings, use \\"halfling\\" to describe beings that are half the height of men. In Jack Vance's Lyonesse series of novels, \\"halfling\\" is a generic term for beings such as fairies, trolls and ogres, who are composed of both magical and earthly substances. In Clifford D.

Born in Frankfurt am Main in Germany, he was the third of the five sons of Gutle (Schnapper) and Mayer Amschel Rothschild, and was of the second generation of the Rothschild banking dynasty. Like his four brothers, he was from 1822, the Nathan Mayer, Freiherr von Rothschild, an Austrian Baron; however, he never used the title. Once the wealthiest man on earth, he was the richest among the Rothschilds. Biography =Early life, origins in Frankfurt= Nathan Mayer Rothschild was born on 16 September 1777 to Mayer Amschel Rothschild and Gutle Schnapper in the Frankfurt Ghetto, Free City of Frankfurt, Holy Roman Empire (what is today Germany). He was born to an Ashkenazi Jewish family. Nathan counted among his brothers; Amschel Mayer Rothschild, Salomon Mayer Rothschild, Carl Mayer Rothschild and James Mayer Rothschild. He was the third oldest son and all five brothers would go on to become close business partners spread out across Europe. Rothschild also had five sisters, this included Henriette Rothschild, who married Abraham Montefiore. =Move to England and involvement in textile trade= In 1798, at the age of 21, he settled in Manchester, England and established a business in textile trading and finance, later moving to London, England, beginning to deal on the London Stock Exchange from 1804. He made fortune in trading bills of exchange through a banking enterprise begun in 1805, dealing with financial instruments such as foreign bills and government securities. Rothschild became a freemason of the Emulation Lodge, No. 12, of the Premier Grand Lodge of England on 24 October 1802, in London. Up until this point, the few Ashkenazi Jews that lived in England tended to belong to the \\"Antients\\" on account of their generally lower social class, while the more established Sephardim joined the Moderns. =Gold, securities trading and the Napoleonic Wars= From 1809 Rothschild began to deal in gold bullion, and developed this as a cornerstone of his business, which was to become N. M. Rothschild & Sons. From 1811 on, in negotiation with Commissary-General John Charles Herries, he undertook to transfer money to pay Wellington's troops, on campaign in Portugal and Spain against Napoleon, and later to make subsidy payments to British allies when these organized new troops after Napoleon's disastrous Russian campaign. Later, during the 1840s, as early socialists in France such as Alphonse Toussenel and Pierre Leroux attacked the Rothschilds and \\"Jewish financiers\\" in general, a French socialist from among their circle, Georges Marie Mathieu- Dairnvaell, authored a work entitled Histoire √©difiante et curieuse de Rothschild Ier, Roi des Juifs (\\"Edifying and Curious History of Rothschild the First, King of the Jews\\"). Within it he made claims about Nathan Mayer Rothschild's early knowledge of the outcome of the Battle of Waterloo, whose couriers delivered information about the victory back to London before the British Cabinet itself knew, claiming that he used the knowledge to speculate on the London Stock Exchange and make a vast fortune by unfair advantage against the other British stock holders, essentially defrauding them. Frederic Morton relates the story thus: > To the Rothschilds, [England's] chief financial agents, Waterloo brought a > many million pound scoop. ... a Rothschild agent ... jumped into a boat at > Ostend ... Nathan Rothschild ... let his eye fly over the lead paragraphs. A > moment later he was on his way to London (beating Wellington's envoy by many > hours) to tell the government that Napoleon had been crushed: but his news > was not believed, because the government had just heard of the English > defeat at Quatre Bras. Then he proceeded to the Stock Exchange. Another man > in his position would have sunk his work into consols [bank annuities], > already weak because of Quatre Bras. But this was Nathan Rothschild. He > leaned against \\"his\\" pillar. He did not invest. He sold. He dumped consols. > ... Consols dropped still more. \\"Rothschild knows,\\" the whisper rippled > through the 'Change. \\"Waterloo is lost.\\" Nathan kept on selling, ... consols > plummeted ‚Äì until, a split second before it was too late, Nathan suddenly > bought a giant parcel for a song. Moments afterwards the great news broke, > to send consols soaring. We cannot guess the number of hopes and savings > wiped out by this engineered panic. The Rothschild family and others have claimed that this embellished version of events originated in Mathieu-Dairnvaell's 1846 writing, was further embellished by John Reeves in 1887 in The Rothschilds: the Financial Rulers of Nations, and then repeated in other popular accounts like that of Morton and the 1934 American film directed by Alfred L. Werker, The House of Rothschild. Historian Niall Ferguson agrees that the Rothschilds' couriers did get to London first and alerted the family to Napoleon's defeat, but argues that since the family had been banking on a protracted military campaign, the losses arising from the disruption to their business more than offset any short-term gains in bonds after Waterloo. Rothschild capital did soar, but over a much longer period: Nathan's breakthrough had been prior to Waterloo when he negotiated a deal to supply cash to Wellington's army. The family made huge profits over a number of years from this governmental financing by adopting a high-risk strategy involving exchange-rate transactions, bond-price speculations, and commissions.The House of Rothschild, Volume 1: Money's Prophets, 1798‚Äì1848. Niall Ferguson (1999), New York: Penguin. The Rothschild family archives confirm that, although \\"it is virtually part of English history that Nathan Mayer Rothschild made 'a million' or 'millions' out of his early information about the Battle of Waterloo, the evidence is slender\\". It notes the presence in the archives of a contemporary letter from a Rothschild courier, John Roworth, who wrote to Nathan: \\"I am informed by Commissary White that you have done well by the early information which you had of the Victory gained at Waterloo.\\" The archivists suggest that this comment ‚Äì the only hard evidence of Rothschild making a fortune going long on UK gilts ‚Äì may, in fact, have been a reference to business dealings between Rothschild and the British Government, as suggested by Ferguson. (The contract for supplying cash to Wellington's army had been offered precisely because of Rothschild's international network. \\"The Government had already failed to establish a similar network of its own and had been let down by other more established London firms, and the Rothschild courier and communications network had gained a justifiable reputation for speed and reliability.\\") It confirms that the Rothschild couriers brought news of victory at Waterloo \\"a full 48 hours before the government‚Äôs own riders brought the news to Downing Street\\", but the archive has no records to estimate the size of any gain Rothschild made. \\"But knowing the structure of the market we can conclude that however much Nathan made out of Waterloo, it must have been very considerably less than a million pounds, let alone 'millions'.\\" It is also very commonly reported that the Rothschilds' advanced information was caused by the speed of prized racing pigeons, held by the family. However, this is widely disputed and the Rothschild archive states that, although pigeon post \\"was one of the tools of success in the Rothschild business strategy during the period c. 1820‚Äì1850,... it is likely that a series of couriers on horseback brought the news\\" of Waterloo to Rothschild. More recently, Brian Cathcart has refuted the claim that Rothschild was the first man in London to know of the victory at Waterloo. He traces the earliest news to a dispatch Wellington sent via his messenger to Lord Bathurst, the Secretary of War, which was received on the evening of 21 June. =Family ascent to prominence and later dealings= In 1816, his four brothers were raised to the nobility (Adelung) by the Emperor of Austria. They were now permitted to prefix the Rothschild name with the particle von, although outside the German-speaking world it was common practice across Europe to use the language of diplomacy, rendering names and titles in French, in this case: de. In 1818 he arranged a ¬£5 million loan to the Prussian government and the issuing of bonds for government loans formed a mainstay of his bank's business. He gained a position of such power in the City of London that by 1825‚Äì1826 he was able to supply enough coin to the Bank of England to enable it to avert a liquidity crisis. It appears that Nathan Mayer was the originator of the family device of the 'Five Arrows'. The origin is said to be a Persian tale told to the Patriarch, Mayer Amschel, as the family gathered around his death-bed, when he is said to have observed that the tale was applicable to his own family: individually an arrow may be easily broken, but when held as a bundle they would be unbreakable. In 1818, Nathan Meyer applied for a grant of arms, on learning that gentry status would suffice, and had the Five Arrows confirmed for himself and his wider family. In 1822, all five brothers were granted the title of Baron, or raised to the Freiherrnstand, by the Emperor. From 1822, both Nathan Mayer himself, and any legitimate male descendant, could call himself: Freiherr von Rothschild, or in the language of diplomacy whether in France or not, Baron de Rothschild. In practice, having accepted the aristocratic title for the benefit of his family, he chose not to use it himself and so did not request official recognition of the title. In 1838, two years after his death, Queen Victoria did authorise the use of this Austrian title in the United Kingdom. In 1824, together with Moses Montefiore, he founded the Alliance Assurance Company, which later merged with Sun Insurance to form Sun Alliance. In the aftermath of the Slavery Abolition Act 1833 with the Slave Compensation Act 1837, Rothschild and his business partner Moses Montefiore loaned the British Government ¬£15 million (worth ¬£ in ) with interest which was subsequently paid off by the British taxpayers (ending in 2015). This money was used to compensate the slave owners in the British Empire after the trade had been abolished. According to the Legacies of British Slave-Ownership at the University College London, Rothschild himself was a successful claimant under the scheme, as part of \\"Antigua 390 (Mathews or Constitution Hill)\\", where he was a beneficiary as mortgage holder to a plantation in Antigua which had 158 slaves in his ownership, he received a ¬£2,571 payment at the time (worth ¬£ in ). Retrieved on 20 March 2019. In 1835 he secured a contract with the Spanish Government giving him the rights to the Almad√©n mines in southern Spain, effectively gaining a European mercury monopoly. =Death and legacy= By the time an infected abscess caused his death in 1836, his personal net worth amounted to 0.62% of British national income.Niall Ferguson, The Ascent of Money (2008), p. 88: \\"When Nathan died in 1836, his personal fortune was equivalent to 0.62 per cent of British national income. Between 1818 and 1852, the combined capital of the five Rothschild 'houses' (Frankfurt, London, Naples, Paris and Vienna) rose from ¬£1.8 million to ¬£9.5 million. As early as 1825 their combined capital was nine times greater than that of Baring Brothers and the Banque de France. By 1899, at ¬£41 million, it exceeded the capital of the five biggest German joint-stock banks put together.\\" He had also secured the position of the Rothschilds as the preeminent investment bankers in Britain and Europe. His son, Lionel Nathan Rothschild (1808‚Äì1879), continued the family business in England. Nathan Mayer Rothschild and his wife Hannah are buried in the Brady Street Ashkenazi Cemetery in Whitechapel. During his life, Nathan Mayer Rothschild, as the most accomplished of his brothers, solidified the Rothschild family as a major power in European and thus world affairs. Their great rivals, the Baring family, said of Nathan Mayer and his family; \\"They are generally well planned, with great cleverness and adroitness in execution -- but he is in money and funds what Bonaparte was in war.\\" The German poet Heinrich Heine, a Jewish convert to Lutheranism, declared \\"money is the God of our time and Rothschild is his prophet\\", he described Nathan Mayer Rothschild as one of \\"three terroristic names that spell the gradual annihiliation of the old aristocracy\\", alongside Cardinal Richelieu and Maximilien Robespierre. For Heine, Richelieu had destroyed the power of the old feudal aristocracy, Robespierre had \\"decapitated\\" its weakened remnant and now Rothschild signified the creation of a new social elite, as new lords of finance. The financial system which the Rothschilds created during this period was viewed as a revolutionary development, with a cosmopolitan emphasis, due to the high liquidity of assets in the new system based in bonds, instead of being based in land. Personal life On 22 October 1806 in London, he married Hannah Barent-Cohen (1783‚Äì1850), daughter of Levy Barent Cohen (1747‚Äì1808) and wife Lydia Diamantschleifer. Their children were: # Charlotte Rothschild (1807‚Äì1859) married 1826 Anselm von Rothschild (1803‚Äì1874) Vienna # Lionel Nathan (1808‚Äì1879) married 1836 Charlotte von Rothschild (1819‚Äì1884) Naples # Anthony Nathan (1810‚Äì1876) married 1840 Louise Montefiore (1821‚Äì1910) # Nathaniel (1812‚Äì1870) married 1842 Charlotte de Rothschild (1825‚Äì1899) Paris # Hannah Mayer (1815‚Äì1864) married 1839 Hon.

Edmond took little active part in banking but pursued artistic and philanthropic interests, helping to found scientific research institutions such as the Institut Henri Poincar√©, the Institut de Biologie physico-chimique, the pre-Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique, the Casa Vel√°zquez in Madrid, and the French Institute in London. In 1907, as a cofounder member, he also provided funds and support for the foundation of the Friends of the French National Museum of Natural History Society.Yves Laissus, \\"Cent ans d'histoire\\", 1907-2007 - Les Amis du Mus√©um, centennial special, September 2007, supplement to the quarterly publication Les Amis du Mus√©um national d'histoire naturelle, n¬∞ 230, June 2007, ISSN 1161-9104 . He served as a member of the French Acad√©mie des Beaux-Arts and through it sponsored the archaeological digs of Charles Simon Clermont-Ganneau in Egypt, Eustache de Lorey in Syria, and Raymond Weill in Palestine. Edmond de Rothschild acquired an important collection of drawings and engravings that he bequeathed to the Louvre consisting of more than 40,000 engravings, nearly 3,000 drawings, and 500 illustrated books. Included in this gift were more than one hundred engravings and drawings by Rembrandt. A portion of his art collection was bequeathed to his son James A. de Rothschild and is now part of the National Trust collection at Waddesdon Manor. However, in 1882 Edmond cut back on his purchases of art and began to buy land in Southern Syria (Ottoman Palestine). = Zionism = Herbert Samuel, Palestine, 1920 He became a leading proponent of the Zionist movement, financing the first site at Rishon LeZion. In his goal for the establishment of a Jewish homeland, he promoted industrialization and economic development. In 1924, he established the Palestine Jewish Colonization Association (PICA), which acquired more than of land and set up business ventures. Edmond de Rothschild also played a pivotal role in Israel's wine industry. Under the supervision of his administrators in Ottoman Palestine, farm colonies and vineyards were established, and two major wineries were opened in Rishon LeZion and Zikhron Ya'akov.Encyclopedia of Zionism and Israel, vol. 2, \\"Rothschild, Baron Edmond-James de\\", p. 966 It is estimated that Rothschild spent over $50 million in supporting the settlements and backed research in electricity by engineers and financed development of an electric generating station. Rothschild funded a glass factory that would supply bottles for his wineries. Rothschild met Meir Dizengoff in Paris and chose Dizengoff to launch and manage the new factory, called Mizaga. Dizengoff opened the factory in Tantura in 1892 and managed the factory for approximately two years. Mizaga was the first Jewish-owned factory in Ottoman Palestine. Jews and Arabs lived amicably on Rothschild's land, with no Arab grievances, even in the worst periods of disturbance. According to historian Albert M. Hyamson, \\"Rothschild recognised that the overriding interest of the Jews of Palestine was the confidence and the friendship of their Arab neighbours. The interests of the Arab cultivators of the land he bought were never overlooked, but by development he made this land capable of maintaining a population ten times its former size.\\"Hyamson, Albert M. Palestine: A Policy, Methuen, 1942 p. 58 While Edmond de Rothschild was not always supportive of an inclusive government - he suggested in 1931 to Judah Magnes that \\"We must hold them (the Arabs) down with a strong hand\\" Daniel P. Kotzin, Judah L. Magnes: An American Jewish Nonconformist, Syracuse University Press, 2010 p. 235. \\\\- he acknowledged the importance of co-governance and peaceful coexistence in a 1934 letter to the League of Nations, stating that \\"the struggle to put an end to the Wandering Jew, could not have as its result, the creation of the Wandering Arab.\\"David Whitten Smith, Elizabeth Geraldine Burr, Understanding World Religions: A Road Map for Justice and Peace , Revised Ed., Rowman & Littlefield, 2014 p.224.  Death  Baron Edmond De Rothschild's grave at Ramat HaNadiv In 1934, Baron de Rothschild died at Ch√¢teau Rothschild, Boulogne-Billancourt. His wife died a year later on 29 December 1935. They were interred in P√®re Lachaise Cemetery in Paris until April 1954 when their remains were transported to Israel aboard a naval frigate. At the port of Haifa, the ship was met with sirens and a 19-gun salute. A state funeral was held with former Prime Minister David Ben-Gurion giving the eulogy following which Edmond de Rothschild and his wife were re-interred in Ramat HaNadiv Memorial Gardens near the towns of Zichron Ya'akov and Binyamina, both of which he helped found and are named in his family's honor.  Commemoration  For his Jewish philanthropy Baron Edmond became known as \\"HaNadiv HaYadu'a\\", (Hebrew for \\"The Known Benefactor\\" or \\"The Famous Benefactor\\") and in his memory his son bequeathed the funds to construct the building for the Knesset. Israeli postal stamp, 1954 Israel's 1982/5742 Independence Day coin is dedicated to the memory of Edmond de Rothschild and marks the centenary of his first projects in Israel. From 1982 until 1986, the Bank of Israel used his portrait on the 500 Israeli sheqel note. Rothschild Boulevard in Tel Aviv is named after him, as well as various localities throughout Israel which he assisted in founding. Rishon LeZion, the city which he helped to found named one of the central streets Rothschild Street, and in 1996 Rothschild Mall was built. Also named after him is the Parc Edmond de Rothschild (Edmond de Rothschild Park) in Boulogne-Billancourt.

Owned by National Trust and managed by the Rothschild Foundation, it is one of the National Trust's most visited properties, with over 466,000 visitors in 2018. The Grade I listed house was built in the Neo-Renaissance style of a French ch√¢teau between 1874 and 1889 for Baron Ferdinand de Rothschild (1839‚Äì1898) as a weekend residence for entertaining and to house his collection of arts and antiquities. As the manor and estate have passed through generations of Rothschilds, the collection contained inside has grown and is among the most rare and valuable in the world. In 1957, James de Rothschild bequeathed the house and its contents to the National Trust, opening the house and gardens for the benefit of the general public. Unusually for Grade I listed residences, the family who donated it still manages it. The Rothschild Foundation, chaired by Jacob Rothschild, 4th Baron Rothschild, acts as custodian and continues to invest in the property making it, to some extent, a living residence.

History Aerial view of Waddesdon from the north The Red Drawing Room =1874‚Äì1898= In 1874, Baron Ferdinand de Rothschild bought the Waddesdon agricultural estate from the Duke of Marlborough with money inherited from his father Anselm. Rothschild was familiar with the estate from fox hunting in the locality. At the time of purchase, the estate had no house, park or garden. The site of the future Manor House was a bare hill. Known as Lodge Hill, it had been stripped of its timber by the impoverished Duke of Marlborough prior to the sale.Hall, pp. 37‚Äì41 Over the following three years, the summit of the hill was levelled; eventually, on 18 August 1877, the foundation stone was laid. The first house party was held in May 1880 with seven of Rothschild's close male friends enjoying a fireworks display. When, finally, the main house was ready in 1883, Rothschild invited 20 guests to stay. Before his premature death in 1898, on weekends between May and September Rothschild was host to many important guests including the future king Edward VII, politicians and members of The Souls group. House parties usually involved 14 to 20 guests.The Rothschild Archive Retrieved 28 September 2015; Hall, pp. 153,162 Guests commented on the level of luxury service provided by the 24 house staff.Hall, pp. 156, 160 In 1890, Queen Victoria unusually requested to pay a visit. She was impressed with the beauty of the house and grounds as well as Rothschild's ability to quietly manage the day's events. She was struck by the newly installed electric lights designed to look like candles in the chandeliers, and it is reported that she asked for the room to be darkened to fully witness the effect.Hall, p. 172 =1898‚Äì1957= Plan of Waddesdon's ground floor. 1:Vestibule; 2:Entrance Hall, 3 Red Drawing room; 4:Grey Drawing Room; 5:Library; 6:Baron's Sitting room; 7:Morning Room; 8:West Hall; 9:West Gallery; 10:East Gallery; 11:Dining Room; 12:Conservatory; 13:Breakfast Room; 14:Kitchen; 15:Servant's Hall; 16:Housekeeper's Rooms; 17:Site of further servants quarters (not illustrated); 18:Terrace and parterre; 19 North Drive; St:staircases. Front entrance When Baron Ferdinand died in 1898, the house passed to his sister Alice de Rothschild. She saw Waddesdon as a memorial for her brother and was committed to preserving it. She did add significant items to the collection, particularly furniture and carpets with French royal provenances, Meissen porcelain, textiles and armor.Hall, pp. 180‚Äì91 Following Alice de Rothschild's death in 1922, the property and collections passed to her French great-nephew James A. \\"Jimmy\\" de Rothschild, who was married to an English woman, Dorothy Pinto.

It opened to the public in 1959 with around 27,000 visitors in the first year.Hall, p. 268 Dorothy chaired the new management committee in close collaboration with the National Trust and took a very keen interest in Waddesdon for the remainder of her long life.Rothschild, 1979 At Dorothy's death in 1989, her nephew Jacob Rothschild inherited her position and responsibilities.

Architecture The terrace and parterre garden at Waddesdon Manor, overlooked by the building's south face Prior to the construction of Waddesdon Manor, no house existed on the site. Ferdinand de Rothschild wanted a house in the style of the great Renaissance ch√¢teaux of the Loire Valley.Girouard, p. 22 Ferdinand chose as his architect Gabriel-Hippolyte Destailleur.Girouard, p. 23 Destailleur was already experienced in working in this style, having overseen the restoration of many ch√¢teaux in that region, in particular that of the Ch√¢teau de Mouchy. Through Destailleur's vision, Waddesdon embodied an eclectic style based on the ch√¢teaux so admired by his patron, Baron Ferdinand. The towers at Waddesdon were based on those of the Ch√¢teau de Maintenon, and the twin staircase towers, on the north facade, were inspired by the staircase tower at the Ch√¢teau de Chambord.Girouard, p. 24 However, following the theme of unparalleled luxury at Waddesdon, the windows of the towers at Waddesdon were glazed, unlike those of the staircase at Chambord. They are also far more ornate. The structural design of Waddesdon was not all retrospective. Hidden from view were the most modern innovations of the late 19th century including a steel frame, which took the strain of walls on the upper floors, which consequently permitted the layout of these floors to differ completely from the lower floors.Girouard, p. 34 The house also had hot and cold running water in its bathrooms, central heating, and an electric bell system to summon the numerous servants. The building contractor was Edward Conder & Son. After the Manor was completed in 1883, Ferdinand quickly decided it was too small, as his architect has prophesied. The Bachelors' Wing to the east was extended after 1885 and the Morning Room, built in late-Gothic style, was added to the west after 1888.Bruno Pons, Waddesdon Manor Architecture and Panelling: The James A. de Rothschild Bequest at Waddesdon Manor (London, 1996), pp. 77‚Äì95 The stables to the west of the Manor were built in 1884. Ferdinand and his stud groom devised the plan, working with Conder. Destailleur designed the fa√ßades in a French 17th-century style.Hall, p. 66 =Wine Cellars= Wine Cellars The Wine Cellars in the Manor were created during the Centenary Restoration and opened in 1994. They are modeled on the private cellars at Ch√¢teau Lafite Rothschild. More than 15,000 bottles are stored in the Cellars, some 150 years old, the majority from the Ch√¢teau Lafite Rothschild and Ch√¢teau Mouton Rothschild estates. It is the largest private collection of Rothschild wines in the world. There are also wine labels designed by artists such as Salvador Dali and Andy Warhol.Schwartz, pp. 118‚Äì120 Collections Pedestal clock by Andr√©-Charles Boulle, movement by George Graham, 1720‚Äì1725 Once his ch√¢teau was complete, Baron Ferdinand installed his extensive collections of English 18th-century portraits by artists like Gainsborough and Reynolds, as well as French 18th-century boiseries, Savonnerie carpets, Gobelins and Beauvais tapestries, furniture, S√®vres ceramics, books, Dutch paintings and Renaissance treasures. The Elephant Automaton in the East Gallery Works were acquired for their exquisite quality and fine provenance, particularly those belonging to French royalty of the Ancien R√©gime.

Subsequent members of the family added noted collections of paintings, Limoges enamel, arms and armour, maiolica, manuscripts, prints and drawings. Waddesdon's internationally famous collection has thus been formed principally by four members of the Rothschild family: Baron Ferdinand de Rothschild (1839‚Äì1898), his sister Alice de Rothschild (1847‚Äì1922), their cousin Edmond James de Rothschild (1845‚Äì1934) and the present Lord Jacob Rothschild (b. 1936).Art Collections at Waddesdon Manor Retrieved 21 June 2016 Gardens Baron Ferdinand wanted a garden to entertain his guests during his weekend house parties. To make the gardens, extensive landscaping of the hill was carried out, including leveling the top of the hill. The gardens and landscape park were laid out by the French landscape architect Elie Lain√©. An attempt was made to transplant full-grown trees by chloroforming their roots, to limit the shock. While this novel idea was unsuccessful, many very large trees were successfully transplanted. Elaborate flower beds were planted, centred on the south Parterre. Several artificial rock formations were created by James Pulham, including to house mountain goats and llamas, part of Ferdinand's zoo.Hall, pp. 64‚Äì66, 127 After her brother's death Alice brought the care she had taken with her garden at Eythrope to Waddesdon. Alice was a keen gardener with a good understanding of flowers and plants; she would often walk around and weed the paths. With her head gardener, George Frederick Johnson who worked at Waddesdon from 1905 to 1954, Alice grew flowers for competition.Hall, pp. 194‚Äì206 Alice was responsible for introducing three- dimensional bedding in the shape of a bird, recreated in the gardens today.Schwartz, p. 127Three-dimensional bedding in the shape of a bird Under James, the gardens were less impressive. The South Parterre was grassed over in the 1930s. It was replanted with flowers for the opening of the house under the National Trust in 1959.Hall, pp. 267‚Äì68 As part of the 1990s restoration, Beth Rothschild led a team re-introducing Ferdinand's colour scheme of trees, shrubs and bedding plants. The carpet bedding is now designed on computer allowing the schemes to be quickly installed. The patterns change each year to reflect different themes.Hall, pp. 286‚Äì91 The gardens are listed Grade I on the Register of Historic Parks and Gardens. =Garden trees= Though the trees are not of a great age there are many specimens of deciduous and coniferous trees that have now reached maturity creating the desired effect in the Waddesdon landscape. Some of these trees were planted in the 1870s and responsibility for this fell to William Barron whose job it was to transplant trees from the surrounding countryside to give the grounds of Waddesdon a sense of maturity, creating vistas and focal points under the instructions from Elie Lain√©.Graham Stuart Thomas, Great gardens of Britain, (Mayflower: 1979), p. 236 Deciduous trees were selected on their form, flowering and array of autumnal color. Conifers were selected for their evergreen nature, cones and berries. Today many species such as chestnuts, limes and maples as well as yew, cedars and redwoods can be seen. From Baron Ferdinand's time to today, distinguished visitors have been invited to plant memorial trees. Queen Victoria, King Edward VII, King George V and Queen Mary were early royal visitors.D. de Rothschild, pp. 54‚Äì55 More recently, The Prince of Wales and Prime Ministers Sir John Major and Tony Blair have also planted trees. =Garden sculptures= Baron Ferdinand de Rothschild acquired many fine statues and fountains to add interest to the gardens. A notable feature is his love of 18th-century Italian pieces. The fountains to the north and south of the house include sculptures of Pluto, Proserpina, tritons and nereids originally made by Giuliano Mozani around 1720 for the Ducal Palace of Colorno.T.

Inscribed on a nearby marble slab are the names of the Rothschilds who built and have cared for Waddesdon. =Aviary= Baron Ferdinand de Rothschild also created a cast-iron aviary, inspired by 18th-century pavilions at the Palace of Versailles and Ch√¢teau de Chantilly, as well as his childhood home at Gr√ºneburg. It was completed in 1889. Like other members of his family, such as Walter Rothschild, 2nd Baron Rothschild, Ferdinand was also keen animal lover. He stocked the aviary with exotic birds and enjoyed feeding them for his guests.Hall, pp. 66, 125 Waddesdon Manor aviary The aviary's paint and gilding were restored in 2003 and it now houses endangered species with a focus on breeding programs.

The centre of a civil parish, which also includes the hamlets of Eythrope and Wormstone, Waddesdon was an agricultural settlement with milling, silk weaving and lace making enterprises. History The parish church of St Michael and All Angels dates from 1190 with medieval and Victorian additions. Between 1897 and 1936, Waddesdon had train services on the Aylesbury and Buckingham Railway (later part of the Metropolitan) at Waddesdon railway station, two miles from the village. There was also a halt on the Brill Tramway. In 1874, Baron Ferdinand de Rothschild bought a large estate in the area and built the mansion of Waddesdon Manor on a hill-top above the village. He transformed Waddesdon into an estate village, with new houses for employees and tenants, a school, a public house, cricket pavilion and village hall. Waddesdon Manor and grounds are now the property of the National Trust, and Jacob Rothschild, 4th Baron Rothschild retains the estate and a house at nearby Eythrope. On 17 November 2017, near Waddesdon, there was a mid-air collision between an aeroplane and a helicopter, with four fatalities. Education Waddesdon Village Primary School is a mixed, community, primary school, which has approximately 200 pupils from the age of four through to the age of eleven. The village is also home to Waddesdon Church of England School, a secondary school which holds over 1000 students and staff. It has about over 600 students.

The original such product was given for the sum of all positive integers raised to a certain power as proven by Leonhard Euler. This series and its continuation to the entire complex plane would later become known as the Riemann zeta function. Definition In general, if a is a multiplicative function, then the Dirichlet series :\\\\sum_{n} a(n)n^{-s}\\\\, is equal to :\\\\prod_{p} P(p, s)\\\\, where the product is taken over prime numbers p, and P(p, s) is the sum :1+a(p)p^{-s} + a(p^2)p^{-2s} + \\\\cdots . In fact, if we consider these as formal generating functions, the existence of such a formal Euler product expansion is a necessary and sufficient condition that a(n) be multiplicative: this says exactly that a(n) is the product of the a(p^k) whenever n factors as the product of the powers p^k of distinct primes p. An important special case is that in which a(n) is totally multiplicative, so that P(p, s) is a geometric series. Then :P(p, s)=\\\\frac{1}{1-a(p)p^{-s}}, as is the case for the Riemann zeta-function, where a(n) = 1, and more generally for Dirichlet characters. Convergence In practice all the important cases are such that the infinite series and infinite product expansions are absolutely convergent in some region :\\\\operatorname{Re}(s) > C, that is, in some right half-plane in the complex numbers. This already gives some information, since the infinite product, to converge, must give a non-zero value; hence the function given by the infinite series is not zero in such a half-plane. In the theory of modular forms it is typical to have Euler products with quadratic polynomials in the denominator here. The general Langlands philosophy includes a comparable explanation of the connection of polynomials of degree m, and the representation theory for GLm. Examples The Euler product attached to the Riemann zeta function \\\\zeta(s), using also the sum of the geometric series, is : \\\\prod_{p} (1-p^{-s})^{-1} = \\\\prod_{p} \\\\Big(\\\\sum_{n=0}^{\\\\infty}p^{-ns}\\\\Big) = \\\\sum_{n=1}^{\\\\infty} \\\\frac{1}{n^{s}} = \\\\zeta(s). while for the Liouville function \\\\lambda(n) = (-1)^{\\\\Omega(n)}, it is : \\\\prod_{p} (1+p^{-s})^{-1} = \\\\sum_{n=1}^{\\\\infty} \\\\frac{\\\\lambda(n)}{n^{s}} = \\\\frac{\\\\zeta(2s)}{\\\\zeta(s)}. Using their reciprocals, two Euler products for the M√∂bius function \\\\mu(n) are : \\\\prod_{p} (1-p^{-s}) = \\\\sum_{n=1}^{\\\\infty} \\\\frac{\\\\mu (n)}{n^{s}} = \\\\frac{1}{\\\\zeta(s)} and : \\\\prod_{p} (1+p^{-s}) = \\\\sum_{n=1}^{\\\\infty} \\\\frac{\\\\mu(n)}{n^{s}} = \\\\frac{\\\\zeta(s)}{\\\\zeta(2s)}. Taking the ratio of these two gives : \\\\prod_{p} \\\\Big(\\\\frac{1+p^{-s}}{1-p^{-s}}\\\\Big) = \\\\prod_{p} \\\\Big(\\\\frac{p^{s}+1}{p^{s}-1}\\\\Big) = \\\\frac{\\\\zeta(s)^2}{\\\\zeta(2s)}. Since for even s the Riemann zeta function \\\\zeta(s) has an analytic expression in terms of a rational multiple of \\\\pi^{s}, then for even exponents, this infinite product evaluates to a rational number. For example, since \\\\zeta(2)=\\\\pi^2/6, \\\\zeta(4)=\\\\pi^4/90, and \\\\zeta(8)=\\\\pi^8/9450, then : \\\\prod_{p} \\\\Big(\\\\frac{p^{2}+1}{p^{2}-1}\\\\Big) = \\\\frac{5}{2}, : \\\\prod_{p} \\\\Big(\\\\frac{p^{4}+1}{p^{4}-1}\\\\Big) = \\\\frac{7}{6}, and so on, with the first result known by Ramanujan. This family of infinite products is also equivalent to : \\\\prod_{p} (1+2p^{-s}+2p^{-2s}+\\\\cdots) = \\\\sum_{n=1}^{\\\\infty}2^{\\\\omega(n)} n^{-s} = \\\\frac{\\\\zeta(s)^2}{\\\\zeta(2s)}, where \\\\omega(n) counts the number of distinct prime factors of n, and 2^{\\\\omega(n)} is the number of square-free divisors. If \\\\chi(n) is a Dirichlet character of conductor N, so that \\\\chi is totally multiplicative and \\\\chi(n) only depends on n modulo N, and \\\\chi(n) = 0 if n is not coprime to N, then : \\\\prod_{p} (1- \\\\chi(p) p^{-s})^{-1} = \\\\sum_{n=1}^{\\\\infty}\\\\chi(n)n^{-s}. Here it is convenient to omit the primes p dividing the conductor N from the product. In his notebooks, Ramanujan generalized the Euler product for the zeta function as : \\\\prod_{p} (x-p^{-s})\\\\approx \\\\frac{1}{\\\\operatorname{Li}_{s} (x)} for s > 1 where \\\\operatorname{Li}_s(x) is the polylogarithm. For x=1 the product above is just 1/ \\\\zeta (s). Notable constants Many well known constants have Euler product expansions. The Leibniz formula for œÄ, :\\\\frac{\\\\pi}{4} = \\\\sum_{n=0}^\\\\infty \\\\frac{(-1)^n}{2n+1} = 1 - \\\\frac{1}{3} + \\\\frac{1}{5} - \\\\frac{1}{7} + \\\\cdots, can be interpreted as a Dirichlet series using the (unique) Dirichlet character modulo 4, and converted to an Euler product of superparticular ratios :\\\\frac{\\\\pi}{4} = \\\\left(\\\\prod_{p\\\\equiv 1\\\\pmod 4}\\\\frac{p}{p-1}\\\\right)\\\\cdot\\\\left( \\\\prod_{p\\\\equiv 3\\\\pmod 4}\\\\frac{p}{p+1}\\\\right)=\\\\frac{3}{4} \\\\cdot \\\\frac{5}{4} \\\\cdot \\\\frac{7}{8} \\\\cdot \\\\frac{11}{12} \\\\cdot \\\\frac{13}{12} \\\\cdots, where each numerator is a prime number and each denominator is the nearest multiple of four..

Retrieved on March 12, 2010.\\"Contact.\\" Howard Hughes Medical Institute. Retrieved on March 12, 2010. It was founded in 1953, by Howard Hughes who was an American business magnate, investor, record- setting pilot, engineer, film director, and philanthropist, who was known during his lifetime as one of the most financially successful individuals in the world. It is one of the largest private funding organizations for biological and medical research in the United States. HHMI spends about $1 million per HHMI Investigator per year, which amounts to annual investment in biomedical research of about $825 million. The institute has an endowment of $22.6 billion, making it the second-wealthiest philanthropic organization in the United States and the second-best endowed medical research foundation in the world.Howard Hughes Medical Institute  2013 Year in Review HHMI is the former owner of the Hughes Aircraft Company - an American aerospace firm which was divested to various firms over time.  History  Howard Hughes, businessman, investor, pilot, film director, philanthropist, and founder of the institute. The institute was formed with the goal of basic research including trying to understand, in Hughes's words, \\"the genesis of life itself.\\" Despite its principles, in the early days it was generally viewed as a tax haven for Hughes's huge personal fortune. Hughes was HHMI's sole trustee and he transferred his stock of Hughes Aircraft to the institute, in effect turning the large defense contractor into a tax-exempt charity. For many years the Institute grappled with maintaining its non-profit status; the Internal Revenue Service challenged its \\"charitable\\" status which made it tax exempt. Partly in response to such claims, starting in the late 1950s it began funding 47 investigators doing research at eight different institutions; however, it remained a modest enterprise for several decades. The institute was initially located in Miami, Florida, in 1953. Hughes's internist, Verne Mason, who treated Hughes after his 1946 plane crash, was chairman of the institute's medical advisory committee.Dr. Verne Mason. Miami Physician. Howard Hughes aide dies. Also treated Pershing. The New York Times. November 17, 1965. By 1975, Hughes was sole trustee of the Howard Hughes Medical Institute, which in turn owned all the stock of the Hughes Aircraft Company. In 1969, Representative Wright Patman \\"complained that the Hughes foundation was a tax‚Äêevasion device,\\" noting that the institute spent only $5.7 million for its operations between 1954 and 1961, a period during which Hughes Aircraft accumulated $76.9 million in profits. By 1975, it had also avoided certain stipulations of the 1969 reform act for charitable institutions due to legal filings by Hughes to change its operational status, with his objections going directly to the White House. The institute moved to Coconut Grove, Florida, in the mid-1970s and then to Bethesda, Maryland, in 1976. In 1993, the institute moved to its headquarters in Chevy Chase, Maryland. It was not until after Hughes's death in 1976 that the institute's profile increased from an annual budget of $4 million in 1975 to $15 million in 1978 and prior to Hughes Aircraft sale the number had peaked to $200 million per year. At the time of the sale Hughes Aircraft employed 75,000 people and vast amounts of money from the approximate annual revenue of $6 billion were put into Hughes Aircraft internal research and development rather than the medical institute. Most of the money for the medical institute came from the operations at Ground System Group responsible for providing Air Defense Systems to NATO, Pacific Rim, and the USA. In this period it focused its mission on genetics, immunology, and molecular biology. Since Hughes died without a will as the sole trustee of the HHMI, the institute was involved in lengthy court proceedings to determine whether it would benefit from Hughes's fortune. In April 1984, a court appointed new trustees for the institute's holdings.Note: the original trustees were: Helen K. Copley, Donald S. Fredrickson, M.D., Frank William Gay, James H. Gilliam, Jr., Esq., Hanna H. Gray, Ph.D., William R. Lummis, Esq., Irving S. Shapiro, Esq., George W. Thorn, M.D. In January 1985 the trustees announced they would sell Hughes Aircraft by private sale or public stock offering. On June 5, 1985 General Motors (GM) was announced as the winner of a secretive five-month, sealed-bid auction. The purchase was completed on December 20, 1985, for an estimated $5.2 billion, $2.7 billion in cash and the rest in 50 million shares of GM Class H stock. The proceeds caused the institute to grow dramatically. HHMI completed the building of a new research campus in Ashburn, Virginia called Janelia Research Campus in October 2006. It is modeled after AT&T;'s Bell Labs and the Medical Research Council's Laboratory of Molecular Biology. With a main laboratory building nearly long, it contains of enclosed space, used primarily for research. The campus also features apartments for visiting researchers. In 2007, HHMI and the publisher Elsevier announced they have established an agreement to make author manuscripts of HHMI research articles published in Elsevier and Cell Press journals publicly available six months following final publication. The agreement takes effect for articles published after September 1, 2007. In 2008, the Trustees of the Howard Hughes Medical Institute selected Robert Tjian as the new president of HHMI. In 2009, HHMI awarded fifty researchers, as part of the HHMI Early Career Scientist Competition. In 2014, the institute created a new round of its primary award competition, for a total of $150 million in award money from 2015 to 2012. The institute is expanding the Ashburn campus in 2019. In 2016, the HHMI Trustees selected Erin K. O'Shea, a previous Vice President and Chief Scientific Officer at the institute, the new president of HHMI.

History Established as an old grammar school in 1960, Berkshire Education Committee named John Mason School after sixteenth- century intellectual, diplomat and spy Sir John Mason, whose picture can be found hanging in the school hall. He was born in Abingdon and educated at the nearby Abingdon School. Coincidentally, the first Headteacher of John Mason School, Derrick Hurd, went on to become Head at Easthampstead Park School based on the estate of which Sir John Mason was the keeper in 1548. Situated on Wootton Road, John Mason School is centrally located in a four-way partnership of Abingdon schools known as 14:19 Abingdon. The other members are Larkmead School, Fitzharrys School and Abingdon and Witney College. The four partners share Sixth Form lessons. John Mason has approximately 1000 students as of 2017. Sarah Brinkley began as the school's new headteacher in 2015. She has sinced moved on and become the Executive Headteacher of Abingdon Learning Trust, with Aidrian Rees now the current headteacher as of 2020. =Specialist school and academy status= The three schools in the Consortium were granted Specialist School Status in 2004. John Mason focused on visual arts which meant it received greater funding from the government to provide specialist equipment. In 2006 JMS opened the 06 Gallery, a new construction reflecting the specialism and featuring much of the students' artwork. Previously a community school administered by Oxfordshire County Council, John Mason School converted to academy status on 1 February 2014. However the school continues to co-ordinate with Oxfordshire County Council for admissions. Houses The school has three houses, Stert, Ock, and Thames, of the colours red, green and blue respectively. There was a fourth house, Isis, but this was dissolved in 1993. The houses are named after watercourses in the town of Abingdon. Positive performance According to the Department of Education 2011 breakdown of A-level results, John Mason were the sixth best in the UK for performance in mathematics, with 38% of students getting A* grade. In 2013, then-Education Secretary Michael Gove praised John Mason as \\"a school that, under a particularly inspirational head, is taking very very positive steps to provide students with a range of qualifications and the type of education that is relevant to the modern world.\\" The Welsh Farm The school owns a farm, generally known as the Welsh Farm, at Troedyrhiwgellifawr near the village of Pumsaint and the town of Llandovery in Wales. Students commonly undertake a four-day trip and some have the option to revisit for a Geography Fieldwork trip or a Triple Science Observational Cosmology Trip and in Year 12. The John Mason Association owns and runs the farm, which is visited by nearly all students. Notable former staff and pupils Paul Mayhew-Archer (a writer on The Vicar of Dibley and My Hero) was formerly a teacher at JMS. Famous former pupils include the Premiership footballer Matthew Taylor, West End actor and singer Oliver Tompsett, BBC and Channel 5 news presenter Katie Ledger, folk musician John Spiers and Dr Mike Leahy, who presents his own TV programme Invasion of the Bodyscratchers and has appeared in many other medical programmes.

The school consists of roughly 1900 students and is one of the largest in the state. The school consists of two campuses (junior and senior) both situated on Stephensons Road in Mount Waverley. The Junior Campus holds years 7 and 8, with year levels 9 to 12 at the Senior Campus. The campuses are a short walking distance apart. History Mount Waverley Secondary College officially opened in 1964 with seventy-three Form 1 pupils, six teaching staff and one staff member in the office. The school's emblem, the unicorn, represents Sir Walter Scott who authored the Waverley Novels. The three Light Timber Construction (LTC) buildings, which were clad in orange brick, were constructed in various stages after the school's opening. The school changed name to Mount Waverley Secondary College in the early 1990s and later occupied the site of the former Waverley North Primary School (also constructed in LTC) after that school was closed, thus forming a \\"junior campus\\" from the site. On Tuesday, 28 January 2003 (the day before the commencement of the school year), much of the Middle/Senior campus LTC buildings were destroyed by a deliberately lit fire causing an estimated $4 million in damage. Classrooms damaged in the fire included five IT classrooms, three science rooms, one fabrics room and 11 general purpose classrooms. A further two science rooms and three home economics rooms were also damaged in the fire. All staff and students were relocated to Deakin University's Burwood campus for three weeks immediately after the fire. The rebuilt school was officially opened in December 2004, after $5.6 million was spent on rebuilding.  Facilities Lower Homebush State School, now a historic reserve The senior site has a modern two-story building, which was constructed after the fire of 2003, along with a number of art buildings and portables. (Most of the Light Timber Construction buildings were demolished after the fire). The junior site consisted of 3 blocks and one school oval, all were connected with covered walkways. But in 2009 Mount Waverley Secondary College was given 10.1 million dollars from the government, allowing the build of two brand new buildings on the Junior site. The Junior Campus is now positioned as a flagship school. It has received international attention for design and learning capacity. The Junior Campus design has won the following awards: *International CEFPI Award ‚Äì Best new construction of a major facility * Australian Chapter of the Council of Education ‚Äì Award for Facilities Design * The Project of Distinction Award by the Council of Educational Facility Planners International (CEFPI) for Best Middle School/Junior High The Senior Campus also hosts the 200 seat Unicorn Theatre facility, two libraries, and two gymnasiums. The school once leased a school camp, from the historic trust the historic Lower Homebush State School #2258 in Avoca, Western Victoria. The school was closed in 1967, and reopened as the Lower Homebush Campus in 1996 as a school camp.  Curriculum  In the Junior and Middle Schools (Years 7-8 and 9-10 respectively), the College offers a comprehensive curriculum based on the Victorian Essential Learning Standards (VELS). Students are allowed greater choice in their subjects beginning in Year 9, where they can choose their electives (which are separate from the core curriculum). For the Senior School (Years 11-12), the students can study for their Victorian Certificate of Education (VCE). The College offers a wide range of subjects from all learning areas. Students also have access to Vocational Education and Training (VET) subjects as part of their VCE program.  Co-curriculum  = Student Leadership = The student body is represented by Student Leadership Teams (SLT) that operate at each year level from Years 8-11. Students in Year 12 have the opportunity to become prefects or captains. Recently, Mount Waverley Secondary College's SLT have won numerous awards, including: * Australia's Team Leadership Award for Students (ATLAS) from Halogen Australia * Department of Education and Training SRC of the Year award from the Victorian Student Representative Council (VicSRC) * Group Action Award from the Victorian Student Representative Council (VicSRC) (second runner-up) = Drama = Every year, the College runs a school-wide production. Previous productions include The Addams Family (2019), Bring It On The Musical (2018), Legally Blonde The Musical (2017), Beauty and the Beast (2016), Fame (2015), Footloose (2014), The Writer (2012), Little Shop of Horrors, and Grease. Due to the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic, the College's production of Seussical The Musical was delayed, being pushed into 2021. = Music = Year 7 students at the college have the opportunity to learn an instrument as part of the classroom music program. Instruments taught include those in the brass, woodwind and string families. Outside the classroom, students of all year levels have the opportunity to join ensembles at the College, including wind bands, big bands and string orchestras. Ensembles at the college frequently engage in inter-school festivals and competitions, including the annual Generations in Jazz competition. In 2019, the College's Symphonic Band and Stage Band traveled to Sydney to participate in the Australian International Music Festival. = Sports = Students have the opportunity to participate in a range of inter-school sports competitions, including basketball, badminton, netball, AFL football, cross country, soccer, softball, baseball, cricket, swimming, hockey, volleyball, tennis, athletics, and table tennis. The College boasts a strong reputation in its sporting achievements, particularly within competitions between local schools. Many of the students go on to compete at a state level. Mount Waverley Secondary College's intermediate boys soccer team won the state finals on 5 September 2018. = Debating = The Mount Waverley Association of Debaters (M.A.D.) have several debating teams from Years 9-12 who all represent the College in inter-school debating competitions.

Biography Ernest Dowson was born in Lee, London, in 1867. His great-uncle was Alfred Domett, a poet and politician who became Premier of New Zealand and had allegedly been the subject of Robert Browning's poem \\"Waring.\\" Dowson attended The Queen's College, Oxford, but left in March 1888 without obtaining a degree. In November 1888, he started work with his father at Dowson and Son, a dry-docking business in Limehouse, east London, which had been established by the poet's grandfather. He led an active social life, carousing with medical students and law pupils, going to music halls and taking the performers to dinner. He was also working assiduously at his writing during this time. He was a member of the Rhymers' Club, which included W. B. Yeats and Lionel Johnson. He was a contributor to such literary magazines as The Yellow Book and The Savoy.Richards, (n.d.) Dowson collaborated on two unsuccessful novels with Arthur Moore, worked on a novel of his own, Madame de Viole, and wrote reviews for The Critic. Later in his career, Dowson was a prolific translator of French fiction, including novels by Balzac and the Goncourt brothers, and Les Liaisons dangereuses by Choderlos de Laclos.Richards, (n.d.) In 1889, aged 23, Dowson became infatuated with the 11 year old Adelaide \\"Missie\\" Foltinowicz, daughter of a Polish restaurant owner; in 1893 he unsuccessfully proposed to her.Anon (1968), pp. 61-2. To Dowson's despair, Adelaide was eventually to marry a tailor.Richards, (n.d.) In August 1894, Dowson's father, who was in the advanced stages of tuberculosis, died of an overdose of chloral hydrate. His mother, who was also consumptive, hanged herself in February 1895. Soon after her death, Dowson began to decline rapidly.Anon (1968), p. 62. The publisher Leonard Smithers gave him an allowance to live in France and write translations,Richards, (n.d.) but he returned to London in 1897 (where he stayed with the Foltinowicz family, despite the transfer of Adelaide's affections).Anon (1968), p. 63. In 1899, Robert Sherard found Dowson almost penniless in a wine bar and took him back to the cottage in Catford, where Sherard was living. Dowson spent the last six weeks of his life at Sherard's cottage where he died at age 32. He had become a Catholic in 1892 and was interred in the Roman Catholic section of nearby Brockley and Ladywell Cemeteries.Richards, (n.d.) After Dowson's death, Oscar Wilde wrote: \\"Poor wounded wonderful fellow that he was, a tragic reproduction of all tragic poetry, like a symbol, or a scene. I hope bay leaves will be laid on his tomb and rue and myrtle too for he knew what love was\\".Ernest Christopher Dowson, ed., The Letters of Ernest Dowson, Epilogue, p. 421; Retrieved 10 August 2013 Wilde himself was dead before the end of the year. Works Dowson is best remembered for such vivid phrases as \\"Days of Wine and Roses\\": and \\"Gone with the wind\\": This latter poem was first published in The Second Book of the Rhymer's Club in 1894, and was noticed by Richard Le Gallienne in his \\"Wanderings in Bookland\\" column in The Idler, volume 9. This is also the source of the phrase 'I have been faithful..in my fashion'. Faithful in My Fashion became the title of a 1946 film. Cole Porter paraphrased Dowson in \\"Always True to You in My Fashion\\" from Kiss Me, Kate. Morrissey has the lines, \\"In my own strange way,/I've always been true to you./In my own sick way,/I'll always stay true to you,\\" in \\"Speedway,\\" on the album Vauxhall & I. Margaret Mitchell, touched by the \\"far away, faintly sad sound I wanted\\" of the third stanza's first line, chose that line as the title of her novel Gone with the Wind.https://www.awesomestories.com/asset/view/SOURCE-of-the-TITLE-GWTW- Margaret-Mitchell-Gone-with-the-Wind According to the Oxford English Dictionary, Dowson provides the earliest use of the word soccer in written language (although he spells it socca, presumably because it did not yet have a standard written form). His prose works include the short stories collected as Dilemmas (1895), and the two novels A Comedy of Masks (1893) and Adrian Rome (each co-written with Arthur Moore). =Books= * A Comedy of Masks: a Novel (1893) With Arthur Moore. * Dilemmas, Stories and Studies in Sentiment (1895) * Verses (1896) * The Pierrot of the Minute : a Dramatic Phantasy in One Act (1897) * Decorations in Verse and Prose (1899) * Adrian Rome (1899) With Arthur Moore. * Cynara: a Little Book of Verse (1907) * Studies in Sentiment (1915) * The Poems and Prose of Ernest Dowson, With a Memoir by Arthur Symons (1919) * Letters of Ernest Dowson (1968) * Collected Shorter Fiction (2003) Legacy His collaborator Arthur Moore wrote several witty comic novels about the young adult duo of Anthony 'Tony' Wilder and Paul Morrow (one, 'The Eyes of Light' is mentioned by friend E. Nesbit in her book 'The Phoenix and the Carpet'). Tony is based on Dowson, while Paul is based on Moore. ‚ÄúDays of Wine and Roses‚Äù was recited in the British TV series, The Durrells in Corfu; Season 2, Episode 4. Composer Frederick Delius set a number of Dowson's poems to music, in his Songs of Sunset and Cynara. John Ireland included a setting of \\"I Was Not Sorrowful (Spleen)\\" from Verses (1896) in his 1912 song cycle Songs of a Wayfarer. T. E. Lawrence quotes from Dowson's poem, \\"Impenitentia Ultima,\\" in Seven Pillars of Wisdom, chapter LIV. In anticipation of the anniversary of Dowson's birth on 2 August 2010, his grave, which had fallen derelict and been vandalized, was restored. The unveiling and memorial service were publicised in the local (South London Press) and national (BBC Radio 4 and the Times Literary Supplement) British press, and dozens paid posthumous tribute to the poet 110 years after his death. In the Poems and Prose of Ernest Dowson, a 1919 memoir written by Arthur Symons, Symons described Dowson as, \\"... a man who was undoubtedly a man of genius ... There never was a poet to whom verse came more naturally ... He had the pure lyric gift, unweighed or unballasted by any other quality of mind or emotion...\\" Notes References Citations Sources Anon (1968) \\"Ernest Dowson\\", in Essays and Reviews from the Times Literary Supplement 1967, London: Oxford University Press, pp. 55‚Äì63.

It is carried out to allow medical procedures that would otherwise be intolerably painful for the patient; or where the nature of the procedure itself precludes the patient being awake. A variety of drugs may be administered, with the overall aim of ensuring unconsciousness, amnesia, analgesia, loss of reflexes of the autonomic nervous system, and in some cases paralysis of skeletal muscles. The optimal combination of drugs for any given patient and procedure is typically selected by an anaesthetist, or another provider such as an operating department practitioner, anaesthetist practitioner, physician assistant or nurse anaesthetist (depending on local practice), in consultation with the patient and the surgeon, dentist, or other practitioner performing the operative procedure.  History  Attempts at producing a state of general anaesthesia can be traced throughout recorded history in the writings of the ancient Sumerians, Babylonians, Assyrians, Egyptians, Greeks, Romans, Indians, and Chinese. During the Middle Ages, scientists and other scholars made significant advances in the Eastern world, while their European counterparts also made important advances. The Renaissance saw significant advances in anatomy and surgical technique. However, despite all this progress, surgery remained a treatment of last resort. Largely because of the associated pain, many patients chose certain death rather than undergo surgery. Although there has been a great deal of debate as to who deserves the most credit for the discovery of general anaesthesia, several scientific discoveries in the late 18th and early 19th centuries were critical to the eventual introduction and development of modern anaesthetic techniques. Two enormous leaps occurred in the late 19th century, which together allowed the transition to modern surgery. An appreciation of the germ theory of disease led rapidly to the development and application of antiseptic techniques in surgery. Antisepsis, which soon gave way to asepsis, reduced the overall morbidity and mortality of surgery to a far more acceptable rate than in previous eras. Concurrent with these developments were the significant advances in pharmacology and physiology which led to the development of general anaesthesia and the control of pain. On 14 November 1804, Hanaoka Seish≈´, a Japanese doctor, became the first person to successfully perform surgery using general anaesthesia. In the 20th century, the safety and efficacy of general anaesthesia was improved by the routine use of tracheal intubation and other advanced airway management techniques. Significant advances in monitoring and new anaesthetic agents with improved pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic characteristics also contributed to this trend. Finally, standardized training programs for anaesthesiologists and nurse anaesthetists emerged during this period.  Purpose  General anaesthesia has many purposes, including: #Unconsciousness (loss of awareness) #Analgesia (loss of response to pain) #Amnesia (loss of memory) #Immobility (loss of motor reflexes) #Paralysis (skeletal muscle relaxation and normal muscle relaxation) General anaesthesia should not be used as prophylaxis in patients with a history of contrast medium-induced anaphylaxis.  Biochemical mechanism of action  The biochemical mechanism of action of general anaesthetics is not well understood. Theories need to explain the function of anaesthesia in animals and plants. To induce unconsciousness, anaesthetics have myriad sites of action and affect the central nervous system (CNS) at multiple levels. Common areas of the central nervous system whose functions are interrupted or changed during general anaesthesia include the cerebral cortex, thalamus, reticular activating system, and spinal cord. Current theories on the anaesthetized state identify not only target sites in the CNS but also neural networks and loops whose interruption is linked with unconsciousness. Potential pharmacologic targets of general anaesthetics are GABA, glutamate receptors, voltage-gated ion channels, and glycine and serotonin receptors. Halothane has been found to be a GABA agonist, and ketamine is an NMDA receptor antagonist.  Preanaesthetic evaluation  Prior to a planned procedure, the anesthesiologist reviews medical records and/or interviews the patient to determine the best combination of drugs and dosages and the degree to which monitoring will be required to ensure a safe and effective procedure. Key factors in this evaluation are the patient's age, body mass index, medical and surgical history, current medications, and fasting time. Thorough and accurate answering of the questions is important so that the anaesthetist can select the proper drugs and procedures. For example, a patient who consumes significant quantities of alcohol or illicit drugs could be undermedicated if they fail to disclose this fact, and this could lead to anaesthesia awareness or intraoperative hypertension. Commonly used medications can interact with anaesthetics, and failure to disclose such usage can increase the risk to the patient. An important aspect of pre-anaesthetic evaluation is an assessment of the patient's airway, involving inspection of the mouth opening and visualisation of the soft tissues of the pharynx. The condition of teeth and location of dental crowns are checked, and neck flexibility and head extension are observed.  Premedication  Prior to administration of a general anaesthetic, the anaesthetist may administer one or more drugs that complement or improve the quality or safety of the anaesthetic. One commonly used premedication is clonidine, an alpha-2 adrenergic agonist. Clonidine premedication reduces the need for anaesthetic induction agents, for volatile agents to maintain general anaesthesia, and for postoperative analgesics. It also reduces postoperative shivering, postoperative nausea and vomiting, and emergence delirium. In children, clonidine premedication is at least as effective as benzodiazepines and has less serious side effects. However, oral clonidine can take up to 45 minutes to take full effect, and drawbacks include hypotension and bradycardia. Midazolam, a benzodiazepine characterized by a rapid onset and short duration, is effective in reducing preoperative anxiety, including separation anxiety in children. Dexmedetomidine and certain atypical antipsychotic agents may be used in uncooperative children. Melatonin has been found to be effective as an anaesthetic premedication in both adults and children because of its hypnotic, anxiolytic, sedative, antinociceptive, and anticonvulsant properties. Unlike midazolam, melatonin does not impair psychomotor skills or hinder recovery. Recovery is more rapid after premedication with melatonin than with midazolam, and there is also a reduced incidence of post-operative agitation and delirium. Melatonin premedication also reduces the required induction dose of propofol and sodium thiopental. Another example of anaesthetic premedication is the preoperative administration of beta adrenergic antagonists to reduce the incidence of postoperative hypertension, cardiac dysrhythmia, or myocardial infarction. Anaesthesiologists may administer an antiemetic agent such as ondansetron, droperidol, or dexamethasone to prevent postoperative nausea and vomiting, or subcutaneous heparin or enoxaparin to reduce the incidence of deep vein thrombosis. Other commonly used premedication agents include opioids such as fentanyl or sufentanil, gastrokinetic agents such as metoclopramide, and histamine antagonists such as famotidine. Non- pharmacologic preanaesthetic interventions include playing relaxing music, massage, and reducing ambient light and noise levels in order to maintain the sleep-wake cycle. These techniques are particularly useful for children and patients with intellectual disabilities. Minimizing sensory stimulation or distraction by video games may help to reduce anxiety prior to or during induction of general anaesthesia. Larger high-quality studies are needed to confirm the most effective non-pharmacological approaches for reducing this type of anxiety. Parental presence during premedication and induction of anaesthesia has not been shown to reduce anxiety in children. It is suggested that parents who wish to attend should not be actively discouraged, and parents who prefer not to be present should not be actively encouraged to attend.  Stages of anaesthesia  Guedel's classification, introduced by Arthur Ernest Guedel in 1937, describes four stages of anaesthesia. Despite newer anaesthetic agents and delivery techniques, which have led to more rapid onset of‚Äîand recovery from‚Äîanaesthesia (in some cases bypassing some of the stages entirely), the principles remain. ;Stage 1: Stage 1, also known as induction, is the period between the administration of induction agents and loss of consciousness. During this stage, the patient progresses from analgesia without amnesia to analgesia with amnesia. Patients can carry on a conversation at this time. ;Stage 2: Stage 2, also known as the excitement stage, is the period following loss of consciousness and marked by excited and delirious activity. During this stage, the patient's respiration and heart rate may become irregular. In addition, there may be uncontrolled movements, vomiting, suspension of breathing, and pupillary dilation. Because the combination of spastic movements, vomiting, and irregular respiration may compromise the patient's airway, rapidly acting drugs are used to minimize time in this stage and reach Stage 3 as fast as possible. ;Stage 3: In Stage 3, also known as surgical anaesthesia, the skeletal muscles relax, vomiting stops, respiratory depression occurs, and eye movements slow and then stop. The patient is unconscious and ready for surgery. This stage is divided into four planes: :# The eyes roll, then become fixed; :# Corneal and laryngeal reflexes are lost; :# The pupils dilate and light reflex is lost; :# Intercostal paralysis and shallow abdominal respiration occur. ;Stage 4: Stage 4, also known as overdose, occurs when too much anaesthetic medication is given relative to the amount of surgical stimulation and the patient has severe brainstem or medullary depression, resulting in a cessation of respiration and potential cardiovascular collapse. This stage is lethal without cardiovascular and respiratory support.  Induction  General anaesthesia is usually induced in a medical facility, most commonly in an operating theatre or in a dedicated anaesthetic room adjacent to the theatre. However, it may also be conducted in other locations, such as an endoscopy suite, radiology or cardiology department, emergency department, or ambulance, or at the site of a disaster where extrication of the patient may be impossible or impractical. Anaesthetic agents may be administered by various routes, including inhalation, injection (intravenous, intramuscular, or subcutaneous), oral, and rectal. Once they enter the circulatory system, the agents are transported to their biochemical sites of action in the central and autonomic nervous systems. Most general anaesthetics are induced either intravenously or by inhalation. Intravenous injection works faster than inhalation, taking about 10‚Äì20 seconds to induce total unconsciousness. This minimizes the excitatory phase (Stage 2) and thus reduces complications related to the induction of anaesthesia. Commonly used intravenous induction agents include propofol, sodium thiopental, etomidate, methohexital, and ketamine. Inhalational anaesthesia may be chosen when intravenous access is difficult to obtain (e.g., children), when difficulty maintaining the airway is anticipated, or when the patient prefers it. Sevoflurane is the most commonly used agent for inhalational induction, because it is less irritating to the tracheobronchial tree than other agents. As an example sequence of induction drugs: # Pre-oxygenation to fill lungs with oxygen to permit a longer period of apnea during intubation without affecting blood oxygen levels # Fentanyl for systemic analgesia for intubation # Propofol for sedation for intubation # Switching from oxygen to a mixture of oxygen and inhalational anesthetic Laryngoscopy and intubation are both very stimulating and induction blunts the response to these maneuvers while simultaneously inducing a near- coma state to prevent awareness. = Physiologic monitoring = Several monitoring technologies allow for a controlled induction of, maintenance of, and emergence from general anaesthesia. # Continuous electrocardiography (ECG or EKG): Electrodes are placed on the patient's skin to monitor heart rate and rhythm. This may also help the anaesthesiologist to identify early signs of heart ischaemia. Typically lead II and V5 are monitored for arrhythmias and ischemia, respectively. # Continuous pulse oximetry (SpO2): A device is placed, usually on a finger, to allow for early detection of a fall in a patient's haemoglobin saturation with oxygen (hypoxaemia). # Blood pressure monitoring: There are two methods of measuring the patient's blood pressure. The first, and most common, is non-invasive blood pressure (NIBP) monitoring. This involves placing a blood pressure cuff around the patient's arm, forearm, or leg. A machine takes blood pressure readings at regular, preset intervals throughout the surgery. The second method is invasive blood pressure (IBP) monitoring. This method is reserved for patients with significant heart or lung disease, the critically ill, and those undergoing major procedures such as cardiac or transplant surgery, or when large blood loss is expected. It involves placing a special type of plastic cannula in an artery, usually in the wrist (radial artery) or groin (femoral artery). # Agent concentration measurement: anaesthetic machines typically have monitors to measure the percentage of inhalational anaesthetic agents used as well as exhalation concentrations. These monitors include measuring oxygen, carbon dioxide, and inhalational anaesthetics (e.g., nitrous oxide, isoflurane). # Oxygen measurement: Almost all circuits have an alarm in case oxygen delivery to the patient is compromised. The alarm goes off if the fraction of inspired oxygen drops below a set threshold. # A circuit disconnect alarm or low pressure alarm indicates failure of the circuit to achieve a given pressure during mechanical ventilation. # Capnography measures the amount of carbon dioxide exhaled by the patient in percent or mmHg, allowing the anaesthesiologist to assess the adequacy of ventilation. MmHg is usually used to allow the provider to see more subtle changes. # Temperature measurement to discern hypothermia or fever, and to allow early detection of malignant hyperthermia. # Electroencephalography, entropy monitoring, or other systems may be used to verify the depth of anaesthesia. This reduces the likelihood of anaesthesia awareness and of overdose. = Airway management = Anaesthetized patients lose protective airway reflexes (such as coughing), airway patency, and sometimes a regular breathing pattern due to the effects of anaesthetics, opioids, or muscle relaxants. To maintain an open airway and regulate breathing, some form of breathing tube is inserted after the patient is unconscious. To enable mechanical ventilation, an endotracheal tube is often used, although there are alternative devices that can assist respiration, such as face masks or laryngeal mask airways. Generally, full mechanical ventilation is only used if a very deep state of general anaesthesia is to be induced for a major procedure, and/or with a profoundly ill or injured patient. That said, induction of general anaesthesia usually results in apnea and requires ventilation until the drugs wear off and spontaneous breathing starts. In other words, ventilation may be required for both induction and maintenance of general anaesthesia or just during the induction. However, mechanical ventilation can provide ventilatory support during spontaneous breathing to ensure adequate gas exchange. General anaesthesia can also be induced with the patient spontaneously breathing and therefore maintaining their own oxygenation which can be beneficial in certain scenarios (e.g. difficult airway or tubeless surgery). Spontaneous ventilation has been traditionally maintained with inhalational agents (i.e. halothane or sevoflurane) which is called a gas or inhalational induction. Spontaneous ventilation can also be maintained using intravenous anaesthesia (e.g. propofol). Intravenous anaesthesia to maintain spontaneous respiration has certain advantages over inhalational agents (i.e. suppressed laryngeal reflexes) however it requires careful titration. SponTaneous Respiration using IntraVEnous anaesthesia and High-flow nasal oxygen (STRIVE Hi) is a technique that has been used in difficult and obstructed airways. = Eye management = General anaesthesia reduces the tonic contraction of the orbicularis oculi muscle, causing lagophthalmos, or incomplete eye closure, in 59% of patients. In addition, tear production and tear-film stability are reduced, resulting in corneal epithelial drying and reduced lysosomal protection. The protection afforded by Bell's phenomenon (in which the eyeball turns upward during sleep, protecting the cornea) is also lost. Careful management is required to reduce the likelihood of eye injuries during general anaesthesia. = Neuromuscular blockade = Syringes prepared with medications that are expected to be used during an operation under general anaesthesia maintained by sevoflurane gas: \\\\- Propofol, a hypnotic \\\\- Ephedrine, in case of hypotension \\\\- Fentanyl, for analgesia \\\\- Atracurium, for neuromuscular block \\\\- Glycopyrronium bromide (here under trade name Robinul), reducing secretions Paralysis, or temporary muscle relaxation with a neuromuscular blocker, is an integral part of modern anaesthesia. The first drug used for this purpose was curare, introduced in the 1940s, which has now been superseded by drugs with fewer side effects and, generally, shorter duration of action. Muscle relaxation allows surgery within major body cavities, such as the abdomen and thorax, without the need for very deep anaesthesia, and also facilitates endotracheal intubation. Acetylcholine, the natural neurotransmitter at the neuromuscular junction, causes muscles to contract when it is released from nerve endings. Muscle relaxants work by preventing acetylcholine from attaching to its receptor. Paralysis of the muscles of respiration‚Äîthe diaphragm and intercostal muscles of the chest‚Äîrequires that some form of artificial respiration be implemented. Because the muscles of the larynx are also paralysed, the airway usually needs to be protected by means of an endotracheal tube. Paralysis is most easily monitored by means of a peripheral nerve stimulator. This device intermittently sends short electrical pulses through the skin over a peripheral nerve while the contraction of a muscle supplied by that nerve is observed. The effects of muscle relaxants are commonly reversed at the end of surgery by anticholinesterase drugs, which are administered in combination with muscarinic anticholinergic drugs to minimize side effects. Novel neuromuscular blockade reversal agents such as sugammadex may also be used. Examples of skeletal muscle relaxants in use today are pancuronium, rocuronium, vecuronium, cisatracurium, atracurium, mivacurium, and succinylcholine.  Maintenance  The duration of action of intravenous induction agents is generally 5 to 10 minutes, after which spontaneous recovery of consciousness will occur. In order to prolong unconsciousness for the required duration (usually the duration of surgery), anaesthesia must be maintained. This is achieved by allowing the patient to breathe a carefully controlled mixture of oxygen, sometimes nitrous oxide, and a volatile anaesthetic agent, or by administering medication (usually propofol) through an intravenous catheter. Inhaled agents are frequently supplemented by intravenous anaesthetics, such as opioids (usually fentanyl or a fentanyl derivative) and sedatives (usually propofol or midazolam). With propofol-based anaesthetics, however, supplementation by inhalation agents is not required. At the end of surgery, administration of anaesthetic agents is discontinued. Recovery of consciousness occurs when the concentration of anaesthetic in the brain drops below a certain level (usually within 1 to 30 minutes, depending on the duration of surgery). In the 1990s, a novel method of maintaining anaesthesia was developed in Glasgow, Scotland. Called target controlled infusion (TCI), it involves using a computer-controlled syringe driver (pump) to infuse propofol throughout the duration of surgery, removing the need for a volatile anaesthetic and allowing pharmacologic principles to more precisely guide the amount of the drug used by setting the desired drug concentration. Advantages include faster recovery from anaesthesia, reduced incidence of postoperative nausea and vomiting, and absence of a trigger for malignant hyperthermia. At present, TCI is not permitted in the United States, but a syringe pump delivering a specific rate of medication is commonly used instead. Other medications are occasionally used to treat side effects or prevent complications. They include antihypertensives to treat high blood pressure; ephedrine or phenylephrine to treat low blood pressure; salbutamol to treat asthma, laryngospasm, or bronchospasm; and epinephrine or diphenhydramine to treat allergic reactions. Glucocorticoids or antibiotics are sometimes given to prevent inflammation and infection, respectively.  Emergence  Emergence is the return to baseline physiologic function of all organ systems after the cessation of general anaesthetics. This stage may be accompanied by temporary neurologic phenomena, such as agitated emergence (acute mental confusion), aphasia (impaired production or comprehension of speech), or focal impairment in sensory or motor function. Shivering is also fairly common and can be clinically significant because it causes an increase in oxygen consumption, carbon dioxide production, cardiac output, heart rate, and systemic blood pressure. The proposed mechanism is based on the observation that the spinal cord recovers at a faster rate than the brain. This results in uninhibited spinal reflexes manifested as clonic activity (shivering). This theory is supported by the fact that doxapram, a CNS stimulant, is somewhat effective in abolishing postoperative shivering.Basics of Anesthesia, 5th Edition Authors: Robert K. Stoelting & Ronald D. Miller Cardiovascular events such as increased or decreased blood pressure, rapid heart rate, or other cardiac dysrhythmias are also common during emergence from general anaesthesia, as are respiratory symptoms such as dyspnoea.  Postoperative care  Anaesthetized patient in postoperative recovery. Hospitals strive for pain-free awakening from anaesthesia. Although not a direct result of general anaesthesia, postoperative pain is managed in the anaesthesia recovery unit with regional analgesia or oral, transdermal, or parenteral medication. Patients may be given opioids, as well as other medications like non steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and acetaminophen. Sometimes, opioid medication is administered by the patient themselves using a system called a patient controlled analgesic. The patient presses a button to activate a syringe device and receive a preset dose or \\"bolus\\" of the drug, usually a strong opioid such as morphine, fentanyl, or oxycodone (e.g., one milligram of morphine). The PCA device then \\"locks out\\" for a preset period to allow the drug to take effect. If the patient becomes too sleepy or sedated, he or she makes no more requests. This confers a fail-safe aspect that is lacking in continuous-infusion techniques. If these medications cannot effectively manage the pain, local anesthetic may be directly injected to the nerve in a procedure called a nerve block. In the recovery unit, many vital signs are monitored, including oxygen saturation, heart rhythm and respiration, blood pressure, and core body temperature. Postanesthetic shivering is common. Apart from causing discomfort and exacerbating pain, shivering has been shown to increase oxygen consumption, catecholamine release, cardiac output, heart rate, blood pressure, and intraocular pressure. A number of techniques are used to reduce shivering, such as warm blankets, or wrapping the patient in a sheet that circulates warmed air, called a bair hugger. If the shivering cannot be managed with external warming devices, drugs such as dexmedetomidine, or other Œ±2-agonists, anticholinergics, central nervous system stimulants, or corticosteroids may be used. In many cases, opioids used in general anaesthesia can cause postoperative ileus, even after non-abdominal surgery. Administration of a Œº-opioid antagonist such as alvimopan immediately after surgery can help reduce the severity and duration of ileus. The major complication of general anaesthesia is malignant hyperthermia. Hospitals have procedures in place and emergency drugs to manage this dangerous complication.  Perioperative mortality  Most perioperative mortality is attributable to complications from the operation, such as haemorrhage, sepsis, and failure of vital organs. Current estimates of perioperative mortality in procedures involving general anaesthesia range from one in 53 to one in 5,417. However, a 1997 Canadian retrospective review of 2,830,000 oral surgical procedures in Ontario between 1973 and 1995 reported only four deaths in cases in which an oral and maxillofacial surgeon or a dentist with specialized training in anaesthesia administered the general anaesthetic or deep sedation. The authors calculated an overall mortality rate of 1.4 per 1,000,000. Mortality directly related to anaesthetic management is very uncommon but may be caused by pulmonary aspiration of gastric contents, asphyxiation, or anaphylaxis. These in turn may result from malfunction of anaesthesia-related equipment or, more commonly, human error. A 1978 study found that 82% of preventable anaesthesia mishaps were the result of human error. In a 1954 review of 599,548 surgical procedures at 10 hospitals in the United States between 1948 and 1952, 384 deaths were attributed to anaesthesia, for an overall mortality rate of 0.064%. In 1984, after a television programme highlighting anaesthesia mishaps aired in the United States, American anaesthesiologist Ellison C. Pierce appointed the Anesthesia Patient Safety and Risk Management Committee within the American Society of Anesthesiologists. This committee was tasked with determining and reducing the causes of anaesthesia-related morbidity and mortality. An outgrowth of this committee, the Anesthesia Patient Safety Foundation, was created in 1985 as an independent, nonprofit corporation with the goal \\"that no patient shall be harmed by anesthesia\\". As with perioperative mortality rates in general, mortality attributable to the management of general anaesthesia is controversial. Estimates of the incidence of perioperative mortality directly attributable to anaesthesia range from one in 6,795 to one in 200,200.

The statement and the proof of many theorems of geometry are simplified by the resultant elimination of special cases; for example, two distinct projective lines in a projective plane meet in exactly one point (there is no \\"parallel\\" case). There are many equivalent ways to formally define a projective line; one of the most common is to define a projective line over a field K, commonly denoted P1(K), as the set of one-dimensional subspaces of a two-dimensional K-vector space. This definition is a special instance of the general definition of a projective space. Homogeneous coordinates An arbitrary point in the projective line P1(K) may be represented by an equivalence class of homogeneous coordinates, which take the form of a pair :[x_1 : x_2] of elements of K that are not both zero. Two such pairs are equivalent if they differ by an overall nonzero factor Œª: :[x_1 : x_2] \\\\sim [\\\\lambda x_1 : \\\\lambda x_2].  Line extended by a point at infinity  The projective line may be identified with the line K extended by a point at infinity. More precisely, the line K may be identified with the subset of P1(K) given by :\\\\left\\\\\\\\{[x : 1] \\\\in \\\\mathbf P^1(K) \\\\mid x \\\\in K\\\\right\\\\\\\\}. This subset covers all points in P1(K) except one, which is called the point at infinity: :\\\\infty = [1 : 0]. This allows to extend the arithmetic on K to P1(K) by the formulas :\\\\frac {1}{0}=\\\\infty,\\\\qquad \\\\frac {1}{\\\\infty}=0, :x\\\\cdot \\\\infty = \\\\infty \\\\quad \\\\text{if}\\\\quad x ot= 0 :x+ \\\\infty = \\\\infty \\\\quad \\\\text{if}\\\\quad x ot= \\\\infty Translating this arithmetic in terms of homogeneous coordinates gives, when does not occur: :[x_1 : x_2] + [y_1 : y_2] = [(x_1 y_2 + y_1 x_2) : x_2 y_2], :[x_1 : x_2] \\\\cdot [y_1 : y_2] = [x_1 y_1 : x_2 y_2], :[x_1 : x_2]^{-1} = [x_2 : x_1]. Examples =Real projective line= The projective line over the real numbers is called the real projective line. It may also be thought of as the line K together with an idealised point at infinity ‚àû ; the point connects to both ends of K creating a closed loop or topological circle. An example is obtained by projecting points in R2 onto the unit circle and then identifying diametrically opposite points. In terms of group theory we can take the quotient by the subgroup Compare the extended real number line, which distinguishes ‚àû and ‚àí‚àû. =Complex projective line: the Riemann sphere= Adding a point at infinity to the complex plane results in a space that is topologically a sphere. Hence the complex projective line is also known as the Riemann sphere (or sometimes the Gauss sphere). It is in constant use in complex analysis, algebraic geometry and complex manifold theory, as the simplest example of a compact Riemann surface. =For a finite field= The projective line over a finite field Fq of q elements has points. In all other respects it is no different from projective lines defined over other types of fields. In the terms of homogeneous coordinates , q of these points have the form: : for each in , and the remaining point at infinity may be represented as [1 : 0]. Symmetry group Quite generally, the group of homographies with coefficients in K acts on the projective line P1(K). This group action is transitive, so that P1(K) is a homogeneous space for the group, often written PGL2(K) to emphasise the projective nature of these transformations. Transitivity says that there exists a homography that will transform any point Q to any other point R. The point at infinity on P1(K) is therefore an artifact of choice of coordinates: homogeneous coordinates :[X : Y] \\\\sim [\\\\lambda X : \\\\lambda Y] express a one- dimensional subspace by a single non-zero point lying in it, but the symmetries of the projective line can move the point to any other, and it is in no way distinguished. Much more is true, in that some transformation can take any given distinct points Qi for to any other 3-tuple Ri of distinct points (triple transitivity). This amount of specification 'uses up' the three dimensions of PGL2(K); in other words, the group action is sharply 3-transitive. The computational aspect of this is the cross-ratio. Indeed, a generalized converse is true: a sharply 3-transitive group action is always (isomorphic to) a generalized form of a PGL2(K) action on a projective line, replacing \\"field\\" by \\"KT-field\\" (generalizing the inverse to a weaker kind of involution), and \\"PGL\\" by a corresponding generalization of projective linear maps.Action of PGL(2) on Projective Space ‚Äì see comment and cited paper. As algebraic curve The projective line is a fundamental example of an algebraic curve. From the point of view of algebraic geometry, P1(K) is a non-singular curve of genus 0. If K is algebraically closed, it is the unique such curve over K, up to rational equivalence. In general a (non-singular) curve of genus 0 is rationally equivalent over K to a conic C, which is itself birationally equivalent to projective line if and only if C has a point defined over K; geometrically such a point P can be used as origin to make explicit the birational equivalence.. The function field of the projective line is the field K(T) of rational functions over K, in a single indeterminate T. The field automorphisms of K(T) over K are precisely the group PGL2(K) discussed above. Any function field K(V) of an algebraic variety V over K, other than a single point, has a subfield isomorphic with K(T). From the point of view of birational geometry, this means that there will be a rational map from V to P1(K), that is not constant. The image will omit only finitely many points of P1(K), and the inverse image of a typical point P will be of dimension . This is the beginning of methods in algebraic geometry that are inductive on dimension. The rational maps play a role analogous to the meromorphic functions of complex analysis, and indeed in the case of compact Riemann surfaces the two concepts coincide. If V is now taken to be of dimension 1, we get a picture of a typical algebraic curve C presented 'over' P1(K). Assuming C is non-singular (which is no loss of generality starting with K(C)), it can be shown that such a rational map from C to P1(K) will in fact be everywhere defined. (That is not the case if there are singularities, since for example a double point where a curve crosses itself may give an indeterminate result after a rational map.) This gives a picture in which the main geometric feature is ramification. Many curves, for example hyperelliptic curves, may be presented abstractly, as ramified covers of the projective line. According to the Riemann‚ÄìHurwitz formula, the genus then depends only on the type of ramification. A rational curve is a curve that is birationally equivalent to a projective line (see rational variety); its genus is 0. A rational normal curve in projective space Pn is a rational curve that lies in no proper linear subspace; it is known that there is only one example (up to projective equivalence),. given parametrically in homogeneous coordinates as :[1 : t : t2 : ... : tn].

He is best known for his part in the removal of the Stone of Destiny from Westminster Abbey in 1950.\\"Ian R. Hamilton,\\" Publisher‚Äôs author biography. Birlinn Limited. 2009. (Retrieved 2010-01-09.)  Early life  Hamilton was born in Paisley, Scotland on 13 September 1925, the son of a tailor.\\"Ian Hamilton: Patriot and Nationalist,\\" Siol nan Gaidheal. (Retrieved 2010-01-09.) He attended the John Neilson Institution in Paisley before going on to the University of Glasgow to study law, after having served in the British army. National activism It was at University where Hamilton became politically active. A participant in debates at the Glasgow University Union, he was a member of the Glasgow University Scottish Nationalist Association and the Scottish Covenant Association. He was also the campaign manager for the successful bid to have John MacCormick elected Rector of the University. =Stone of Destiny= On Christmas Eve 1950, Hamilton, along with three other student Scottish nationalists, removed the Stone of Destiny from its place under the Coronation Chair in Westminster Abbey, London. Originally used for the coronation of Scottish monarchs, the Stone had been removed to England by Edward I in 1296 to bolster his claim to the throne of Scotland. After the Acts of Union 1707 between Scotland and England, it was used for the coronation of British monarchs. As such, Hamilton's action in returning the Stone to Scotland was applauded as a symbolic triumph for Scottish nationalism. The Stone was turned over to the Church of Scotland, which surrendered it to English authorities in April 1951. Hamilton and his accomplices were charged, but never prosecuted. The Stone was eventually returned to Scotland in 1996, with provision for subsequent use in the coronation of British monarchs. In 2008, Charles Martin Smith wrote and directed a feature film entitled Stone Of Destiny, based on these events, in which Hamilton was portrayed by Charlie Cox. Hamilton himself had a small part as an English businessman. =MacCormick v. Lord Advocate= When first admitted to the bar as a young advocate in 1953, Hamilton refused to swear allegiance to Queen Elizabeth II arguing that she could only be referred to as \\"Queen Elizabeth\\" (sans regnal number) in Scotland as the regnal numbers counted Queen Elizabeth I, who had not ruled over Scotland or any of the subsequent united kingdoms which it has entered into. MacCormick v Lord Advocate, which Hamilton brought with rector John MacCormick against the Crown, failed. The Inner House of the Scottish Court of Session held that the monarch's title is the sole prerogative of the sovereign, and the Crown had accepted a system whereby regnal numbers were taken from the larger of both former kingdoms in the United Kingdom, that is England and not Scotland. (It was later suggested by Winston Churchill after the accession of Elizabeth II that, in the future, the higher of the two numerals from the English and Scottish sequences would be used. This system has yet to be put to the test). Career After graduating from university, Hamilton was admitted to the bar and became a practising lawyer. He joined the Labour Party for a short while, but has spent most of his life in active politics as a member of the Scottish National Party (SNP). He was SNP candidate for the Strathclyde East seat at the 1994 election to the European Parliament, as well as a candidate for the SNP in the Greenock and Inverclyde seat at the 1999 election to the Scottish Parliament. He was Rector of the University of Aberdeen from 1994‚Äì1996 and was awarded the degree of Doctor of Laws (Honoris Causa) in his final year. He was also chosen by the Glasgow University Scottish Nationalist Association as their candidate for the Glasgow University Rectorial election in 1999 in which he came second to the actor, Ross Kemp. Hamilton has written two autobiographical works, that are also in part polemical, A Touch of Treason (1990) and A Touch More Treason (1994). At one time he wrote a blog, where he posted commentary on Scottish social and political life, but he now posts occasional thoughts to Twitter.https://twitter.com/ianhamilton_qc?lang=en = Royal Bank of Scotland lawsuit = In February 2009, BBC News and The Daily Telegraph reported that Hamilton was suing the Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS) over claims they had mis-sold shares to him in April 2008.Cramb, Auslan. \\"Former QC takes Royal Bank of Scotland to court in shares row,\\" The Daily Telegraph. 19 February 2009. (Retrieved 2010-01-10.) Hamilton purchased 640 shares at ¬£2 per share as part of a ¬£12 billion rights issue. The writ he lodged in court claimed that the bank invited shareholders, including him and his wife, to invest in a rights issue, an offer that he took up on her behalf. The writ further alleged that RBS induced him to invest his money by \\"concealing the true state of their finances\\".\\"Pensioner takes on Royal Bank of Scotland in court battle,\\" The Daily Record. 18 February 2009. (Retrieved 2010-01-10.) He further alleged that the bank was \\"negligent in representing themselves as solvent at all material times when in fact they were insolvent\\". RBS stated they would defend themselves vigorously against the claims made by Hamilton, but he dropped the case on 26 February 2009 after the small claims court refused to deal with it, citing the legal and factual complexity of the case, which would require trial in a higher court.  Portrayals in popular culture  In 2008, Hamilton's book, The Taking of the Stone of Destiny, was made into a movie entitled Stone of Destiny. The film depicted Hamilton (played by Charlie Cox) as the protagonist leading a team of students to reclaim the Stone of Destiny.

He is best known for his music, which often includes social, economic, and cultural commentary on Brazil. The firstborn son of S√©rgio Buarque de Hollanda, Buarque lived at several locations throughout his childhood, though mostly in Rio de Janeiro, S√£o Paulo, and Rome. He wrote and studied literature as a child and found music through the bossa nova compositions of Tom Jobim and Jo√£o Gilberto. He performed as a singer and guitarist the 1960s as well as writing a play that was deemed dangerous by the Brazilian military dictatorship of the time. Buarque, along with several Tropicalist and MPB musicians, was threatened by the Brazilian military government and eventually left Brazil for Italy in 1969. However, he came back to Brazil in 1970, and continued to record, perform, and write, though much of his material was suppressed by government censors. He released several more albums in the 1980s and published three novels in the 1990s and 2000s. Early life and career  Buarque was born on 19 June 1944. He came from an intellectually privileged family background‚Äîhis father S√©rgio Buarque de Holanda was a well-known historian, sociologist and journalist and his mother Maria Am√©lia Ces√°rio Alvim was a painter and pianist. He is also brother of the singer Mi√∫cha and politician Ana de Hollanda. As a child, he was impressed by the musical style of bossa nova, specifically the work of Tom Jobim and Jo√£o Gilberto. He was also interested in writing, composing his first short story at 18 years old and studying European literature, also at a young age. One of his most consuming interests, however, was playing football, beginning at age four, which he still does today. Born in Rio de Janeiro, Buarque spent much of his childhood there and in S√£o Paulo and Italy. Before becoming a musician, Buarque decided at one point to study architecture at the University of S√£o Paulo, but this choice did not lead to a career in that field; Buarque often skipped classes. National Archives of Brazil. He made his public debut as musician and composer in 1964, rapidly building his reputation at music festivals and television variety shows when bossa nova came to light and Nara Le√£o recorded three of his songs. His eponymous debut album exemplified his future work, with catchy sambas characterized by inventive wordplay and an undercurrent of nostalgic tragedy. Buarque had his first hit with \\"A Banda\\" in 1966, written about a marching band, and soon released several more singles. Although playing bossa nova, during his career, samba and M√∫sica popular brasileira would also be widely explored. Despite that, Buarque was criticized by two of the leading musicians at the time, Caetano Veloso and Gilberto Gil as they believed his musical style was overly conservative. However, an existentially themed play that Buarque wrote and composed in 1968, Roda Viva (\\"Live Circle\\"), was frowned upon by the military government and Buarque served a short prison sentence because of it. He left Brazil for Italy for 18 months in 1970, returning to write his first novel in 1972, which was not targeted by censors. Chico Buarque performs in 2007. At this time his thinly veiled protest single \\"Apesar de Voc√™\\" (\\"In spite of You\\" ‚Äì in reference to the military dictatorship) was also produced. (\\"In spite of you\\") was overlooked by the military censors, becoming an important anthem in the democratic movement. After selling over 100,000 copies, the single was eventually censored and removed from the market. At one point in 1974, the censors banned any song authored by Chico Buarque. Then, he created a pseudonym, naming himself \\"Julinho da Adelaide\\", complete with life history and interviews to newspapers. \\"Julinho da Adelaide\\" authored songs such as \\"Jorge Maravilha\\" and \\"Acorda amor\\" before he was outed in Jornal do Brasil news story. Buarque also wrote a play named Calabar, about the Dutch invasion of Brazil in the seventeenth century, drawing parallels with the military regime. Despite the censorship, songs such as \\"Samba de Orly\\" (1970), \\"Acorda amor\\" (1974, as \\"Julinho da Adelaide\\") manifested Buarque's continuing opposition to the military regime. During the 1970s and 1980s, he collaborated with filmmakers, playwrights, and musicians in further protest works against the dictatorship. Buarque approached the 1983 Concert for Peace in Nicaragua as a valid forum to vocalize his strong political views. Throughout the decade, he crafted many of his songs as vehicles to describe the re- democratization of Brazil. The Concert for Peace in Nicaragua was one in a concert series known as the \\"Central American Peace Concerts.\\" These concerts featured various Latin American artists. The political turmoil that plagued this era were expressed in many of Buarque's songs. He later wrote Budapeste, a novel that achieved critical national acclaim and won the Pr√™mio Jabuti, a Brazilian literary award comparable to the Man Booker Prize. His 2017 album Caravanas was elected the 3rd best Brazilian album of that year by the Brazilian edition of Rolling Stone. \\"C√°lice\\" Following the Brazilian military coup of 1964, Buarque avoided censorship by using cryptic analogies and wordplay. For example, in the song \\"C√°lice\\" (\\"Chalice\\"), a duet written in 1973 with Gilberto Gil and released with Milton Nascimento in 1978, he takes advantage of the homophony between the Portuguese imperative cale-se (\\"shut up\\") and c√°lice (\\"chalice\\") to protest government censorship, disguised as the Gospel narrative of Jesus' Gethsemane prayer to God to relieve Him of the cup of suffering. The line \\"Quero cheirar fuma√ßa de √≥leo diesel\\" (\\"I want to sniff diesel fumes\\") is a reference to the death of political prisoner Stuart Angel, who reportedly had his mouth glued to a jeep's exhaust pipe during a torture session. \\"'Bebida amarga' n√£o era met√°fora em 'C√°lice'\\". Futepoca. January 29, 2010. Buarque was close to Stuart's mother, Zuzu Angel.

Woodcut published by Leonhard Thurneysser in 1574. Thurneysser was a student of Paracelsus. Alkahest is a hypothetical \\"universal solvent\\": able to dissolve every other substance, including gold. The famous alchemist Philippus Paracelsus described alkahest in the 1500s. Because of its perceived invaluable medicinal qualities, alchemists of the time were concerned with its plausibility and existence. Etymology The name is believed to have been invented by Paracelsus from Switzerland, who modeled it on similar words taken from Arabic, such as \\"alkali\\". Paracelsus' own recipe was based on caustic lime, alcohol, and carbonate of potash.Paracelsus' recipe is popular with chemists even today; a bath of potassium hydroxide in ethanol leaves laboratory glassware sparkling clean He believed that alkahest was, in fact, the philosopher's stone. Issues with the concept A potential problem involving alkahest is that, if it dissolves everything, then it cannot be placed into a container because it would dissolve the container. However, the alchemist Philalethes specified that alkahest dissolved only composed materials into their constituent, elemental parts; hence, a hypothetical container made of a pure element (say, lead) would not be dissolved by alkahest. The old remark \\"spit is the universal solvent\\" satirizes the idea, suggesting that instead of a solvent that would easily dissolve anything, the only \\"real\\" solvent to anything is a great deal of hard work. In modern times, water is sometimes called the universal solvent, because it can dissolve a large variety of substances, due to its chemical polarity and amphoterism. Paracelsus's successor A later alchemist, Franciscus Mercurius van Helmont, picked up where Paracelsus had left off. In his major texts he also gave attention to transmutation of metals, to techniques for separating the pure from the impure parts of nature, and, of special significance, to a substance, called the liquor alkahest, which he accepted as one of the greatest secrets of Paracelsus and which he referred to as incorruptible dissolving water that could reduce any body into its first matter. Van Helmont's writings pointed to even earlier medieval descriptions of a substance called sal alkali. Sal alkali, in turn, appears to have been a solution of caustic potash in alcohol, which dissolves many substances. Helmont described a process in which his alkahest (sal alkali) was applied to olive oil. The result was identified as a sweet oil, which was glycerol.

It is a direct sequel to 2001's Final Fantasy X, the first game in the Final Fantasy series to receive such a follow-up. The story follows Yuna as she searches for Tidus, the main character of the previous game, while trying to prevent political conflicts in Spira from escalating to war. In addition to being the first direct Final Fantasy sequel, Final Fantasy X-2 was the first game in the series to feature just three player characters, an all- female main cast, and early access to the overworld. The battle system incorporates Final Fantasy character classes‚Äîone of the series' signature gameplay concepts‚Äîand is one of the few entries to have multiple endings. The soundtrack was created by Noriko Matsueda and Takahito Eguchi in lieu of long- time Final Fantasy composer Nobuo Uematsu. The game was positively received by critics and was commercially successful, selling over 5.4 million copies on PlayStation 2 and winning a number of awards. It was the last Final Fantasy game to be released by Square before it merged with Enix in April 2003. The game was re-released as in high-definition for PlayStation 3 and PlayStation Vita in 2013, alongside Final Fantasy X, as Final Fantasy X/X-2 HD Remaster. Final Fantasy X/X-2 HD Remaster was later released for PlayStation 4 in 2015, Microsoft Windows in 2016, and Xbox One and Nintendo Switch in 2019.  Gameplay  Players navigate in the field by controlling the on-screen character directly. New areas are accessible by jumping or climbing. Final Fantasy X-2 is a role-playing video game in which players take on the role of Yuna as she explores the fictional world of Spira. In contrast to its predecessor, Final Fantasy X, players may visit almost every location in Spira from an early point in the game via airship. The field-map navigation system is largely unchanged from Final Fantasy X; players navigate large, continuous three dimensional areas by controlling the on-screen character. A few upgrades have been implemented, providing the player with extended interaction with the environment through jumping, climbing, and rotating camera angles. The game's sidequests include minor tasks and quests, optional bosses and dungeons, and the most minigames of any Final Fantasy at the time of its release. These minigames include Gunner's Gauntlet (a shooter game) and Sphere Break (a math- based coin game), and a management sim based on blitzball, the fictional underwater sport from Final Fantasy X. Unlike its predecessor, in which the player's course through the world was largely linear, Final Fantasy X-2 allows players to visit almost any location at any time. The game consists of five chapters, with each location featuring one scenario per chapter. Together, the five scenarios in one locale form a subplot of the game called an \\"Episode\\". Players are free to engage with as many or as few optional scenarios as they choose; only a few scenarios per chapter are required to advance the game's central plot and are marked on the world navigation system as \\"Hotspots\\". Both Hotspots and optional scenarios contribute to a story completion tracker and the latter may indirectly influence the main narrative. Achieving 100% completion unlocks a secret ending. When the game is finished, New Game Plus option gives players the opportunity to replay the game with different choices with all of the items and storyline completion percentage achieved previously intact. However, all character levels are reset. A battle with an early boss, with the characters in their default dresspheres The combat in Final Fantasy X-2 uses an enhanced version of the Active Time Battle (ATB) system, in which characters and enemies take actions according to their speed. This implementation of ATB allows characters to interrupt enemies while they are preparing to take an action. With precise timing, it is possible to chain attacks together for greater damage. Characters may change their character class mid-battle using dresspheres and the Garment Grid. These dresspheres, based on Final Fantasy character classes, allow access to different abilities to alter the course of battle. The Garment Grid is a placard featuring a geometric shape connected by nodes. Characters have access to dresspheres placed in the nodes. Depending on the properties of the Garment Grid, changing dresspheres in battle will grant bonuses such as increased strength or added elemental effects. Characters can learn new skills for each dressphere with the use of Ability Points (AP). AP is earned by defeating enemies and by the use of items and abilities for that sphere.  Plot  = Setting = Like the preceding game, Final Fantasy X-2 is set in the fictional world of Spira, consisting of one large landmass divided into three subcontinents, surrounded by small tropical islands. It features diverse climates, ranging from the tropical Besaid and Kilika islands, to the temperate Mi'ihen region, to the frigid Macalania and Mt. Gagazet areas. Although predominantly populated by humans, Spira features a variety of people. Among them are the Al Bhed, a technologically advanced but previously disenfranchised sub-group of humans with distinctive green eyes and unique language. The Guado are less human in appearance, with elongated fingers and other arboreal features. Still less human are the lion-like Ronso and the frog-like Hypello. A subset of Spira's sentient races are the \\"unsent\\", the strong-willed spirits of the dead that remain in corporeal form. In Spira, the dead who are not sent to the Farplane by a summoner come to envy the living and transform into \\"fiends\\", the monsters that are encountered throughout the game; however, unsent with strong attachments to the world of the living may retain their human form. Aesthetically, the world of Spira is essentially unchanged in the two years since Final Fantasy X, and many locations return from the game. There are, however, major changes in the ideology of Spira's people. After Sin's defeat came the arrival of an era known as \\"the Eternal Calm\\". The priests of the Yevon religion chose to expose the truth about the order, leaving the population to decide for themselves how to live in a world without that religion and without Sin. Advanced technology and the Al Bhed are embraced by the population, which has begun to pursue leisures such as attending musical concerts and participating in the sport of blitzball. Others have become hunters of ancient treasures, ranging from coins and machinery to spheres in forgotten caves and ruins. Those who pursue the latter are known as \\"sphere hunters\\", of which many groups have formed. In the absence of Yevon, groups have formed. Young people were especially quick to abandon Yevon and embrace machinery, while many of the older generation felt that cultural changes were happening too quickly. The most influential of the groups are the progressive Youth League, led by Mevyn Nooj and seeking a break from the past, the New Yevon Party, led by a former priest named \\"Trema\\" until his disappearance and later by Praetor Baralai, which seeks more gradual change, and the neutral Machina League, led by Gippal. By the start of the game, there are rising tensions between the Youth League and New Yevon factions. Both groups have sought out High Summoner Yuna's support, who has instead joined a sphere hunter group with her cousin in hopes of finding a way to bring back Tidus, her lost love who vanished during the ending of Final Fantasy X.Rikku: Well, look, I really want Yuna to go. / Wakka: She can't do that. / Rikku: Why not? / Wakka: Because she's booked solid for three months, ya! And everybody wants to see her. / Rikku: Oh yeah? Well, what about what she wants? / Wakka: Well, yeah, but... Okay, maybe once things calm down, y'know? / Rikku: And what if they don't, Wakka? What then, huh? I don't believe it. After everything Yuna did for us! Why can't she just do what she wants to do now? Why? You know, every time I visited here, I wondered... why is it, that when everyone's out making their dreams happen and everyone's getting their chance, Yuna's dreams are on hold? / Wakka: Gee, it's not like... / Rikku: What do you know anyway, tubby? Yuna? / Yuna: I want... (I want to journey again. But... if I leave, I'll be disappointing everyone else.) I want... I'll go. Square Co. Eternal Calm Final Fantasy X-2: Prologue Square Enix U.S.A. 2002 = Characters = The three main playable characters of Final Fantasy X-2 are Yuna, Rikku, and Paine, whose team is abbreviated in-game as \\"YRP\\" (\\"YuRiPa\\" in the original Japanese version). Yuna and Rikku reprise their roles from Final Fantasy X, and, though their personalities are much the same as before, Square decided that their appearances would be heavily altered to give a greater impression of activity. Furthermore, it was decided that the pervading cultural changes occurring in Final Fantasy Xs world as they and others began trying to live positively would be reflected in the new clothing of these two characters. The character of Paine is a new creation designed for inclusion in Final Fantasy X-2, to accommodate the game's intended action-adventure style revolving around a trio of female characters. Several other major and supporting characters from Final Fantasy X appear in the game. Additionally, other characters are introduced in Final Fantasy X-2, such as the faction leaders and the Leblanc Syndicate, a group of sphere hunters who serve as the Gullwings' rivals for much of the game. The game's main antagonist is Shuyin, another new character. = Story = Two years after Sin's defeat, Yuna, Rikku and Paine recover Yuna's stolen Garment Grid from the Leblanc Syndicate in the first of several encounters in which they vie for spheres. The game is punctuated by a narration of Yuna addressing Tidus, as though she is recounting the events of the game to him as they occur. Meanwhile, the Gullwings discover an ancient sphere containing images of an enormous machina weapon called \\"Vegnagun\\" that was secretly buried beneath Bevelle. The weapon has enough power to threaten all of Spira, The Gullwings join forces with the Leblanc Syndicate to investigate the underground areas of the city in an attempt to destroy the machine before it can be used by either side in the upcoming conflict. However, discovering a large tunnel recently dug into the floor of the weapon's chamber, they realize that Vegnagun has apparently moved to the Farplane, located at Spira's core. Disagreements between Spira's factions are punctuated further after the disappearance of Baralai, Nooj, and Gippal‚Äîthe leaders of New Yevon, the Youth League and the Machine Faction respectively. Returning to the underground areas of Bevelle, the Gullwings discover the missing faction leaders discussing Vegnagun and learn that the machine's AI allows it to detect hostility and to respond by activating itself and fleeing. Paine had once been friends with all three men. Two years earlier in a cave beneath Mushroom Rock Road called \\"the Den of Woe\\", just before the failed Operation Mi'ihen, the squad's final exercise was conducted. Within the cave, the various squad candidates were swarmed by pyreflies and driven to kill one another. The only survivors were Paine, Baralai, Gippal, and Nooj. Before the four survivors could leave the cave, the spirit of Shuyin‚Äîrequiring a host in order to interact with the world physically‚Äîhad possessed Nooj, and later forced him to shoot his comrades. Shuyin possesses Baralai's body, pursuing Vegnagun to the Farplane. Nooj and Gippal follow in pursuit, asking Yuna to keep things under control on the surface. Yuna falls into the Farplane and meets Shuyin, who mistakes her for a woman named Lenne. Shuyin expresses his anger that Spira's citizens have not yet come to understand the heartache that war can cause, and plans to use Vegnagun to destroy all of Spira. 1000 years before the game, Shuyin was a famous blitzball player in the high-tech metropolis of Zanarkand, and the lover of a popular songstress and summoner‚ÄîLenne. Before he could use Vegnagun, Lenne begged him to stop. Shuyin yielded, but a group of Bevelle soldiers arrived a moment later and shot the couple. The Gullwings organize a concert to which everyone in Spira is invited, supporters of the Youth League and New Yevon alike. Additionally, the Songstress dressphere worn by Yuna is revealed to hold Lenne's memories, resulting in a sphere screen projecting them to everyone in attendance during the concert. Witnessing images of Shuyin and Lenne's last moments, Spira's citizens begin to understand the unproductive nature of their disagreements. Although the factional fighting has ceased, Shuyin has nearly carried out his plan to destroy Spira with Vegnagun. Joining forces with the Leblanc Syndicate once again, the Gullwings make their way to the Farplane and find Gippal and Nooj already battling Vegnagun. Once the group destroys Vegnagun, Yuna uses her songstress dressphere to convince Shuyin to let go. However, Shuyin finally realizes that Yuna is not Lenne and attacks her, gaining a physical form to do so. The Gullwings quickly defeat Shuyin, and Lenne's spirit appears to soothe him as they both depart together. Subsequently, the fayth once located in Bevelle appears before Yuna and thanks her as well. He then asks her if she would like to see \\"him\\" again. If the player replies with \\"Yes\\", and a sufficient percentage of the game's optional storyline has been completed, the fayth locates Tidus's scattered pyreflies and sends them to Besaid, where they reform; thus, when Yuna returns home, she is reunited with Tidus. Players who achieve 100% completion in addition to reviving Tidus will see an additional reunion scene in Zanarkand where the pair discuss whether he is truly real or still a dream.  Development  Development of Final Fantasy X-2 began in late 2001 in response to the success of Final Fantasy X, particularly fan reaction to the Eternal Calm video included in the Japanese version of Final Fantasy X International. It was released in Japan shortly before the merger between Square and Enix. The name X-2 was initially not liked by the production team, but it was eventually accepted since the story was a direct continuation of X and thus could not be the next numbered game in the series. Kazushige Nojima, the previous game's writer, was also skeptical about the creation of a sequel. Something he was particularly averse to originally was the happy ending, which he felt was wrong for the story. The production team was one third the size of the previous installment. This was because the team was already familiar with the material and it allowed them to give a hand-crafted feel to the game. In designing the game, a significant number of character models, enemies, and location designs from Final Fantasy X were reused. Character designer Tetsuya Nomura has explained that this allowed the game to be developed in one year and at half the normal scope Final Fantasy games are normally produced. Maya and Softimage 3D were the two main programs used to create the graphics. Producer Yoshinori Kitase and director Motomu Toriyama have explained that the objective in mind when designing Final Fantasy X-2 was to embrace the concept of change as the game's theme and establish a more upbeat atmosphere than its predecessor. The reuse of the engine and locations from the original game meant that the team could spend most of their time focusing on the gameplay systems and plot. To portray the drastic change in Spira, the developers excluded summons, redesigned towns, and included vehicles. The low-flying vehicles were added to allow the player quicker access and mobility to the areas that were already available in the previous game. Final Fantasy X-2 incorporated a number of elements from modern Japanese pop culture. The ending of Final Fantasy X meant that the Aeon summoning system from the game could not be used in the sequel, necessitating the team to make a new gameplay system. Because of the emphasis on a more optimistic setting, the game's dressphere system, inspired by the magical girl subgenre of anime and manga, was implemented, and the atmosphere of J-pop introduced right from the game's opening sequence. Additional allusions to popular culture in general were featured, such as the style of Charlie's Angels. Toriyama explained that one of the concepts at issue during development was providing a large variety of minigames, such that \\"if you bought Final Fantasy X-2 you wouldn't need any other game\\". The dressphere system, along with having a lead cast of three non-\\"macho\\" girls were intended to keep the tone of the game light and lively. Lulu was excluded from the lead cast because, in addition to being married, her presence would have given her an \\"older sister\\" role to Yuna, rather than letting Yuna take the lead on discovering herself on her own. Though work on the opening song and motion capture began early in development, the opening sequence was actually the last portion of the game to be completed. = Music = For Final Fantasy X-2, Noriko Matsueda and Takahito Eguchi replaced regular series composer Nobuo Uematsu. The soundtrack included two J-pop songs: \\"Real Emotion\\" and \\"1000 Words\\". Koda Kumi performs the Japanese versions of the songs, and did the motion capture for the \\"Real Emotion\\" full motion video shown in the game's opening. She also voices Lenne in the Japanese version of the game. Jade Villalon of Sweetbox recorded the song's English versions, and she released extended versions as bonus tracks for the Japanese release of the album Adagio. Koda released her own English versions of \\"Real Emotion\\" and \\"1000 Words\\" on the CD single for \\"Come with Me\\", although it had a slightly different translation.  Versions and merchandise  As with Final Fantasy X, an expanded international version, Final Fantasy X-2 International + Last Mission, was produced for Final Fantasy X-2. It introduces two new dresspheres, an additional \\"Last Mission\\" at a location called \\"Yadonoki Tower\\", and the option to capture numerous monsters and characters including Tidus, Auron and Seymour Guado from Final Fantasy X‚Äîas well as several supporting characters from both games‚Äîduring battle. This version was not released outside Japan, although the English voices were used for the main story in the international version (not in Last Mission). Due to this change, parts of the Japanese subtitles were changed or altered to fit the voice- overs. This was detailed in the strategy book for the international version. In 2005, a compilation featuring Final Fantasy X and Final Fantasy X-2 was released in Japan as Final Fantasy X/X-2 Ultimate Box. Several action figures, books and soundtracks were released by Square Enix. Among the books that were published were three Ultimania guidebooks, a series of artbooks and strategy guides published by Square Enix in Japan. They feature original artwork from Final Fantasy X-2, offer gameplay walkthroughs, expand upon many aspects of the game's storyline, and feature several interviews with the game's developers. There are three books in the series: Final Fantasy X-2 Ultimania, Final Fantasy X-2 Ultimania Œ©, and Final Fantasy X-2: International+Last Mission Ultimania. A similar three-book series was produced for Final Fantasy X. Gaming peripheral company Hori produced PlayStation 2 controllers modeled after the Tiny Bee guns Yuna uses in Final Fantasy X-2. These controllers were released only in Japan. They were re-released in a new silver box to coincide with the release of Final Fantasy X-2: International + Last Mission. They released a vertical stand for the console with a Final Fantasy X-2 logo that lights up in blue color when plugged into a powered console. On September 13, 2011, Square Enix announced that Final Fantasy X would be re-released in high- definition for the PlayStation 3 and PlayStation Vita, in celebration of the game's 10 year anniversary. Yet rumors spread that it would include its sequel Final Fantasy X-2 In January 2012, production of the game had started. Producer Yoshinori Kitase was once again involved in the production of the game, wishing to work on its quality, but with no confirmation of the inclusion of the sequel. On February 18, 2013 the first footage of the PlayStation Vita version of Final Fantasy X HD was released, showing off HD models of Tidus, Yuna, Bahamut and Yojimbo. On 19 March, it was confirmed that the PS3 version of the game would include its sequel X-2, and that it would be remastered in HD and would be based on the international version. Final Fantasy X-2 Last Mission was announced to be remastered in HD and included as well. The HD remastered games for the PS3 was released as Final Fantasy X/X-2 HD Remaster. The two games were sold separately on PlayStation Vita in Japan with Final Fantasy X HD Remaster to include Final Fantasy X HD Remaster and Final Fantasy X Eternal Calm HD Remaster and Final Fantasy X-2 HD Remaster to include Final Fantasy X-2 HD Remaster and Final Fantasy X-2 Last Mission HD Remaster. They were sold together with a voucher to download Final Fantasy X-2 HD Remaster for free in regions outside Japan as well as in Japan. Square Enix launched an website for the two HD remastered games in March 2013. In 2014, it was announced that the remaster would be released for the PlayStation 4 in early 2015.  Reception  = Critical response = According to review aggregator Metacritic, Final Fantasy X-2 received generally positive reception since its release. In 2006, Japanese video game magazine Famitsu polled its readers on the best video game of all time, and Final Fantasy X-2 was ranked 32nd. The game's English release won the Seventh Annual Academy of Interactive Arts & Sciences award in 2004 for \\"Outstanding Achievement in Character Performance\\" for the character Rikku. IGN summarized Final Fantasy X-2 as \\"a brilliant and addictive romp through Spira that we're certainly glad to experience\\", and GameSpot commenting that it was as endearing and poignant as its forebears, and with strengths that outweighed any of its flaws. A writer for RPGamer regarded the battle system as innovative and \\"very simple to navigate\\". While GameSpot praised the battle system as a \\"welcome addition\\", the website disliked the increased inclusion of minigames. GameSpy, while initially unsure about the new system, praised it as a solid alternative with unexpected depth. Critics had mixed reactions to Final Fantasy X-2 's tonal shift from its predecessor. IGN felt the changes were part of its intrigue, praising the narrative's political elements and comedic tone compared to the first game. The website also gave praised to the character writing and gameplay changes. Further positive reactions came from RPGamer, with one staff reviewer summarizing X-2 as \\"a light-hearted fun game\\" that \\"may... be the most enjoyable thing to come from the series in several years\\". By contrast, GameSpot commented that some of the missions came off as too frivolous, and that its non-linear nature made the narrative unfocused compared to the first game. The soundtrack was met with mixed feelings, due to a lack of input from Uematsu and its stylistic change to a J-pop atmosphere. While IGN and 1Up.com commended the music as a fitting backdrop to the action and new style, Electronic Gaming Monthly regarded it as \\"too bubbly.\\" RPGamer suggested that \\"the absence of Uematsu proves deafening\\", but noted that its lighter tone matched the tone and events of the game. The game's reuse of graphical designs from Final Fantasy X was the subject of criticism. RPGamer and GameSpot commented that despite the lack of overt improvement on the first game, it was still one of the best-looking PS2 games at the time. Electronic Gaming Monthly regarded this reuse of code as \\"[tripping up] in the one area where Final Fantasy titles usually shine\\". GameSpy shared this view. RPGamer also criticised the multiple outfits as too revealing and aimed more at attracting male gamers than being true to the characters. = Sales = In 2003, Final Fantasy X-2 sold over 1.94 million copies in Japan, making it the highest- selling game of the year. Within nine months of its Japanese release, it sold more than a million copies in North America (within two months of its release there), and nearly four million copies worldwide. It went on to sell 2.11 million units in Japan, 1.85 million units in the United States, and more than 100,000 units in the United Kingdom. International + Last Mission sold over 288,000 copies in Japan over the course of 2004. As of March 2013, the game has sold over 5.4 million copies worldwide on PlayStation 2.FINAL FANTASY X & FINAL FANTASY X-2 REMASTERED On PlayStation¬Æ3 & PlayStation¬ÆVita Release Chinese & English version in 2013 globally! PlayStation.com (Asia) - Hong Kong In October 2013, Square Enix announced Final Fantasy X and its sequel Final Fantasy X-2 have together sold over 14 million copies worldwide on PlayStation 2.

Its name derives from the Old Norse Laxa meaning 'Salmon River'. Its key distinguishing features are its three working vintage railways and the largest working waterwheel in the world. It is also the location of King Orry's Grave. The village lies on the A2, the main Douglas to Ramsey road, and on the vintage Manx Electric Railway, and Snaefell Mountain Railway. Laxey Glen is one of the Manx National Glens; another glen, Dhoon Glen, is about 1 miles away. The Raad ny Foillan long distance coastal footpath, opened in 1986, runs along the coast of Laxey Bay through the village. History Laxey Wheel, September 2015 Beach and promenade at Laxey In the 19th century lead and zinc mining began; it became the largest industry in the village, but ended in 1929. The village also had a fishing industry. From a notable Manx fishing family living in Laxey in 1800s, Robert Lawson lived with his family in \\"Sea Villa\\" on the promenade. He converted this property from a cottage into a large house, then built \\"Bay View Terrace\\" of five houses about 50 yards behind the promenade. One of his sons, Robert Edwin (\\"Ted\\") was harbour master in the 1880s. This Lawson family first appeared on the island around 1580, (documented)in Bride, and in Lonan in the 1600s. They were fishermen/farmers, and were later associated with the local mining industry. During the 1700s and 1800s, the Lawsons and their relatives were perhaps one of the largest families in the Laxey area. In the late 1800s the Manx Electric Railway line was built through the village, opening it up to tourists. Other attractions were built at that time, including Snaefell Mountain Railway and the Laxey Glen Pleasure Gardens. Laxey village is now a mainly residential and tourist area. There are several public gardens, primarily Laxey Glen Gardens. There is also a handweaving mill which sells its own products and many others. The village has five pubs and a microbrewery, The Old Laxey Brewing Company. The village is built around a wooded glen with a number of steep winding streets and paths leading to the floor of the glen, from where one can walkAs at 2017, the riverside path is closed as it was partly washed away in a recent flood. by the side of Laxey River to its outflow to the sea at the small harbour, and onto the beach and promenade. One can also walk around the cliffs to the north of the beach from opposite the \\"La Mona Lisa Restaurant\\". This walk goes over the cairn (kern), from where there are views of Laxey Bay and Clay Head to the south. A Laxey-born and bred person would say, \\"I'm going over the kern for a walk\\". Many of Laxey's buildings were built as mining cottages in the traditional Manx style. To the southeast of the village centre, above the left bank of the Laxey River, is the Minorca area. Old Laxey has winding streets around the harbour. The village centre is a newer, late Victorian section further inland is the area of shops and services around the railway station. =Mining= The Great Laxey Mine was a silver, lead ore and zinc mine. The mine reached a depth in excess of 2,200 ft (670 m) and consisted primarily of three shafts: the Welsh Shaft, the Dumbell's Shaft and the Engine Shaft, each of these shafts being connected by a series of levels.Mona's Herald. Wednesday, 23 March 1904; Page: 7 The Washing Floor of the Great Laxey Mine There is no exact date for the startt of mining at Laxey, but by 1782 workings were being opened. The mine yielded zinc, silver ore, copper pyrites and hematite iron in significant quantities; and by the 1830s over 200 men were employed in the mines, the figure rising steadily until over 600 were employed by 1900. Following various short-term closures, by May 1929 rumours had begun to circulate about the future of the mine. By then, most of the miners had left, with many emigrating to South Africa, Australia or the United States of America.Isle of Man Examiner. Friday, 24 May 1929; Page: 11 Continued flooding in the lower reaches of the mine combined with antiquated pumping machinery finally led to the end of mining operations at Laxey, and on the Isle of Man. However some of the spoil residue was brought to the washing floors to extract any remaining worth from it. It is thought that this continued until 1934, when all working finally ceased. Demographics The Isle of Man census 2011 lists the village district population as 1,705. It is the fourth largest village on the island. Governance Historically, Laxey was in the parish of Lonan within the sheading of Garff. Until 2016, Laxey was a village district with its own commissioners. From 1 May 2016, it merged with the parishes of Lonan and Maughold to form the new parish district of Garff, within which it is a ward. Laxey is also part of the Keys constituency of Garff, whose representation increased in 2016 from one to two members. Tourism = Laxey Wheel = The Laxey WheelLaxey Wheel, also known as Lady Isabella after the wife of The Hon. Charles Hope, then Lieutenant Governor of the Isle of Man, was built in 1854 to pump water from the Laxey mine shafts. Now a tourist attraction, it remains the largest working waterwheel in the world. Designed by Robert Casement, it is in diameter and wide. It revolves at about 3 rpm. The Wheel was owned by Edwin Kneale from 1939 to 1965; he saved it from being dismantled and ran it as a tourist attraction, before passing it on to the Manx nation, with the agreement that it should be kept in perpetual running order for the people of the Isle of Man. In 1965 the Isle of Man Government bought the wheel and the site. Restoration work began, and in 1989 it was put under the control of Manx National Heritage. The Great Laxey Mine Railway re- opened with two small steam engines in September 2004 to carry passengers along the restored route. =Laxey Woollen Mills= The Laxey Woollen Mills were founded in 1881 by Egbert Rydings, supported by John Ruskin, and were originally water powered.Laxey Woollen Mills history The mills are known for producing Manx tartan which is used to make a variety of items from hats, scarfs and kilt skirts to capes and rugs. The cloth is made of fine Manx Loaghtan wool and woven on traditional-style looms. One loom operates by bicycle-power. The mills are now mainly a working shop, but still weave the Manx tartan and other cloth. The Laxey Woollen Mills also contain a busy craft shop, a tea-room, and the Hodgson Loom Gallery, which holds monthly arts and crafts exhibitions. =Laxey Harbour and Bay= Laxey Tram Station, Isle of Man Laxey station with a car of the Snaefell Mountain Railway The village has a small harbour at the river mouth which was built in the 1850s to service the mining industry. It is now used by leisure craft and inshore fishing vessels that utilise Laxey Bay and further offshore. Laxey Bay is a protected Marine Nature Reserve. =Ancient monument= Laxey is the site of King Orry's Grave. =Conventions= The Isle of Man is a popular venue for conventions. As an example, Laxey was the venue for the Linuxbierwanderung in 2016. Transport The cafe and booking office at Laxey Station Laxey lies on the Manx Electric Railway line, a vintage line which runs for 17 miles along the coast, between Douglas and Ramsey. Laxey station is in the north of the village and is also the southern terminus of the Snaefell Mountain Railway which runs for five miles between Laxey and the top of Snaefell mountain. Laxey is also on the route of most buses between Douglas and Ramsey. Religion Laxey had a number of Methodist chapels. Shore Road Primitive Methodist Chapel was built in 1825, and closed in 1870. Glen Road Wesleyan Methodist Chapel was opened in 1850. It closed in 1966. Minorca Primitive Methodist Chapel was opened in 1870 and Sunday School was built in 1898 in land across the road; the chapel closed in 1966 when Glen Road and Minorca combined. In 1970 Minorca's Sunday School building became the new Methodist chapel for Laxey. Christ Church, the Church of England parish church, was built to a design of Ewan Christian and constructed by the Mining Company at a cost of ¬£950. It was consecrated by the Bishop of Sodor and Man, Lord Auckland, on 27 May 1856. Education Laxey School is a primary school located on Quarry Road. Sport Laxey F.C., based at Glen Road, play in the Isle of Man Football League.

In ecology and Earth science, a biogeochemical cycle or substance turnover or cycling of substances is a pathway by which a chemical substance moves through biotic (biosphere) and abiotic (lithosphere, atmosphere, and hydrosphere) compartments of Earth. There are biogeochemical cycles for the chemical elements calcium, carbon, hydrogen, mercury, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus, selenium, and sulfur; molecular cycles for water and silica; macroscopic cycles such as the rock cycle; as well as human-induced cycles for synthetic compounds such as polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB). In some cycles there are reservoirs where a substance remains for a long period of time.  Systems  Ecological systems (ecosystems) have many biogeochemical cycles operating as a part of the system, for example, the water cycle, the carbon cycle, the nitrogen cycle, etc. All chemical elements occurring in organisms are part of biogeochemical cycles. In addition to being a part of living organisms, these chemical elements also cycle through abiotic factors of ecosystems such as water (hydrosphere), land (lithosphere), and/or the air (atmosphere). The living factors of the planet can be referred to collectively as the biosphere. All the nutrients‚Äîsuch as carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus, and sulfur‚Äîused in ecosystems by living organisms are a part of a closed system; therefore, these chemicals are recycled instead of being lost and replenished constantly such as in an open system. The flow of energy in an ecosystem is an open system; the sun constantly gives the planet energy in the form of light while it is eventually used and lost in the form of heat throughout the trophic levels of a food web. Carbon is used to make carbohydrates, fats, and proteins, the major sources of food energy. These compounds are oxidized to release carbon dioxide, which can be captured by plants to make organic compounds. The chemical reaction is powered by the light energy of the sun. Sunlight is required to combine carbon with hydrogen and oxygen into an energy source, but ecosystems in the deep sea, where no sunlight can penetrate, obtain energy from sulfur. Hydrogen sulfide near hydrothermal vents can be utilized by organisms such as the giant tube worm. In the sulfur cycle, sulfur can be forever recycled as a source of energy. Energy can be released through the oxidation and reduction of sulfur compounds (e.g., oxidizing elemental sulfur to sulfite and then to sulfate). Although the Earth constantly receives energy from the sun, its chemical composition is essentially fixed, as the additional matter is only occasionally added by meteorites. Because this chemical composition is not replenished like energy, all processes that depend on these chemicals must be recycled. These cycles include both the living biosphere and the nonliving lithosphere, atmosphere, and hydrosphere.  Reservoirs  The chemicals are sometimes held for long periods of time in one place. This place is called a reservoir, which, for example, includes such things as coal deposits that are storing carbon for a long period of time. When chemicals are held for only short periods of time, they are being held in exchange pools. Examples of exchange pools include plants and animals. Plants and animals utilize carbon to produce carbohydrates, fats, and proteins, which can then be used to build their internal structures or to obtain energy. Plants and animals temporarily use carbon in their systems and then release it back into the air or surrounding medium. Generally, reservoirs are abiotic factors whereas exchange pools are biotic factors. Carbon is held for a relatively short time in plants and animals in comparison to coal deposits. The amount of time that a chemical is held in one place is called its residence time.  Important cycles  The most well-known and important biogeochemical cycles are shown below: Image:Carbon cycle-cute diagram.svgalt=Diagram of the carbon cycleCarbon cycle Image:Nitrogen_Cycle.jpgalt=Diagram of the nitrogen cycleNitrogen cycle Image:WhalePump.jpgalt=Diagram of the nutrient cycleNutrient cycle Image:Oxygen cycle.svgalt=Diagram of the oxygen cycleOxygen cycle Image:phoscycle-EPA.jpgalt=Diagram of the phosphorus cyclePhosphorus cycle Image:SulfurCycle copy.jpgalt=Diagram of the sulfur cycleSulfur cycle Image:Rockcycle.jpgalt=Diagram of the rock cycleRock cycle Image:Water cycle.pngalt=Diagram of the water cycleWater cycle There are many biogeochemical cycles that are currently being studied for the first time as climate change and human impacts are drastically changing the speed, intensity, and balance of these relatively unknown cycles. These newly studied biogeochemical cycles include * the mercury cycle, and * the human-caused cycle of PCBs. Biogeochemical cycles always involve hot equilibrium states: a balance in the cycling of the element between compartments. However, overall balance may involve compartments distributed on a global scale. As biogeochemical cycles describe the movements of substances on the entire globe, the study of these is inherently multidisciplinary. The carbon cycle may be related to research in ecology and atmospheric sciences. Biochemical dynamics would also be related to the fields of geology and pedology.

It is at the north end of Douglas Bay. Administratively a district, it has the second largest population of settlements on the island, after Douglas, with which it forms a conurbation. In Manx the name for the village is Kione Droghad meaning \\"bridge end\\". Early history In the 1890s a 5,000-year-old stone age axe was found in the Cassa Field by Onchan wetlands. In the Viking reign Onchan became part of Middle sheading. The name of the village is identified with St Connachan who was Bishop of Sodor and Man in 540 and the church named after him, Kirk Coonachan. An early name for the village is which literally translated means \\"bridgehead\\". The earliest written record of Kiondroghad was in the 1643 Manorial Roll, when it was very small. The name Kiondroghad appeared on the 1841 census but not the one in 1851. The Butt Molly Carooin's Cottage Gradually the village spread beyond Church Road, known locally as The Butt. At the junction with the track that led towards the mountains (Avondale Road) a few more cottages appeared in the early 19th century. In the late 19th century land was sold off for terraces of houses to be built. The area surrounding Church Road is today the village's heritage area and the location of Molly Carooin's Cottage, which is maintained by the Friends Of Onchan's Heritage, a local volunteer group. The area features period lamp standards, and since 2001 has been home to the newly developed Village Green which links Church Road with the Onchan Wetlands to the north west. There is also a vehicle garage, a highways department depot, a barber shop and several residential dwellings in the area which leads to St Peter's Church via the one-way road. The Jubilee Lamp was erected in this road in 1987 after relocation from White City, and this was the first electrically lit lamp standard on the island. Twentieth-century development Onchan Head From The Sea In the early 20th century the Port Jack area was being developed in connection with the Douglas Bay Estate Company's promotion of land sales on the Howstrake Farm. They also built an electric urban railway which later became a coastal railway to Ramsey. There was then a mixture of private houses, terraced houses and guest houses to take the overflow of visitors to Douglas. There was further development in the 1930s. During the Victorian and Edwardian tourism boom Onchan made a bid to become the island's second resort, encouraging the building of hotels and guest houses. The Manx Electric Railway was constructed in 1893, but never achieved its goal of connecting with the heart of Douglas for commuter journeys. In the early 20th century Lower Onchan, around the Port Jack area, was the first area on the island to have electric-powered street lighting, powered by the Manx Electric Railway generators. After World War II development gradually continued, and in the 1960s the village commissioners built local authority housing. Government House The official residence of the Lieutenant Governor of the Isle of Man, the representative on the Isle of Man of the Lord of Mann, currently Queen Elizabeth II, is Government House on Governor's Road. Originally named Bemahague House, the house was leased to Governor Henry Brougham Loch in 1865, and purchased by the Isle of Man Government in 1903 as the official residence for the Sovereign's representative. Transport Onchan Head Station There are ten Manx Electric Railway stops in Onchan.https://manxelectricrailway.co.uk/mer-stop-list/ Onchan Head railway station was the first official stop on the line and served the former White City pleasure grounds. There are also stops at Port Jack, Gandhi (or whatever the restaurant is currently called), Majestic, Braeside, Far End, Howstrake, Groudle Old Road, Groudle Glen and Eskadale. The village has a frequent bus service of Bus Vannin: there are several local services in Onchan and Douglas; these serve the various housing estates including Ballachrink, Lakeside Gardens, Birch Hill and Governor's Hill. The last of these is in Douglas, but through services often link all estates. There is now a regular through service to Nobles Hospital, north-west of Douglas. Onchan is also served by buses to Laxey and Ramsey as well as by local taxi firms. Religion St Peter's Church The Church of England parish church in Onchan is St Peter's on Church Road. The original church, dedicated to St Conchan, dated back to the 12th century. By 1760 the walls and roof had become dangerous and it was condemned in 1771. But nothing was done until the Bishop of Sodor and Man, Bishop Ward commissioned a new church. Its foundation stone was laid in 1830, but due to pressures from the parishioners, it was moved to its current position. The church was built by John Samuel Skillicorn, and was consecrated in 1833. It was dedicated to Saint Peter. The church was refurbished in 1863. In 1897 it was the first church on the island to be lit by electricity, to celebrate the Diamond Jubilee of Queen Victoria; the electricity was supplied by the Isle of Man Tramways and Power Company. St Anthony's Roman Catholic Church is located on Ridgeway Road. Onchan Methodist Church, part of the Douglas and Peel circuit, is on Main Road. Onchan Baptist Church is on Whitebridge Road. Facilities and accommodation Private Dwelling In Onchan The main shopping areas are The Village Walk, a small shopping arcade and Avondale Court, both off Avondale Road, Main Road and Port Jack. A house on the Whitebridge Road at one time had its own (private) miniature railway in its grounds. This was never a public railway. Onchan Community Centre is located off School Road with a community hall, sports hall, games room and committee room. There are a number of hotels and guest houses in the village and the Glen Dhoo and Lower Ballacottier campsites. DHSOB FC operate a campsite each year during the annual Isle of Man TT motorcycle racing. The area has a number of residential housing estates including a large collection of local authority housing at Nursery Avenue, an estate at Ballachrink which also houses more local authority dwellings, Lakeside Gardens to the north east side of the village, Birch Hill, which can be found above the core village area and a number of older residences in the centre, notably Royal Avenue, Port Jack and Alberta Drive all of which were developed in the earliest years of the twentieth century. Demographics The Isle of Man census 2006 lists the population as 9,172, an increase from the population of 8,803 in 2001. It is the largest village on the island. It also has a higher population than three of the four towns - Castletown, Peel and Ramsey, making it the second largest settlement on the island. Onchan is now principally a dormitory village, providing homes for workers in nearby Douglas. Education There are two primary schools in Onchan, Onchan Primary School on School Road with nearly 400 pupils and Ashley Hill Primary School () on Ashley Road which was opened in 1972 and has about 350 pupils. For secondary education children in Onchan usually go to either Ballakermeen High School in Douglas or St Ninian's High School which has a lower school (years 7‚Äì9) in Onchan and an upper school (years 10‚Äì11 and sixth form) in Upper Douglas. Notable people * Vice- Admiral William Bligh FRS (1754‚Äì1817) was an officer of the British Royal Navy, and best known as \\"Captain Bligh\\" of Mutiny on the Bounty fame, married Elizabeth Betham, the daughter of a Customs Collector, on 4 February 1781 in Onchan. * Sir John Charles Ready Colomb KCMG (1838 in Onchan ‚Äì 1909 in London) was a British naval strategist. He was returned to parliament (1886‚Äì1892) as Conservative member for Bow and Bromley, and afterwards (1895‚Äì1906) for Great Yarmouth. * Joseph Clayton Clarke (1857 in Onchan ‚Äî 1937 in Hammersmith, London) who worked under the pseudonym \\"Kyd\\", was a British artist best known for his illustrations of characters from the novels of Charles Dickens. * Colin Hardman (1947 in St Helens ‚Äì 2006 at Oliver's Mount, Scarborough) renowned sidecar racer, who in partnership with Dave Molyneux was the winner of the 1989 Sidecar TT Race 'A'. Sport =Football= Onchan is home to two football clubs, both of which compete in the Isle of Man Football League. Douglas High School Old Boys F.C. (DHSOB FC) are based at the DHSOB Football Ground, Blackberry Lane and are in the Premier League. Onchan F.C. are based at Nivison stadium, Onchan Pleasure Park and are in Division 2. The stadium was opened in 1952. =Stock cars= There is stock car racing held each week in the summer months in the Pleasure Park organised by the British Stock Car Association. There is also bowling, tennis and kart racing at the park as well as the Onchan Squash and Social Club. =Equestrian= The Abbeyland Equestrian Centre is on Scollag Road, but this has been knocked down and built over by houses. =Golf= King Edward Bay Golf Club is an 18-hole golf course located in an elevated position on the east side of the village off the A11 King Edward Road. =Pleasure Park= Onchan Pleasure Park is a leisure park which has a boating lake, miniature golf course, football pitch, tennis courts and a British Stock Car Association stock car racing track. Onchan Village Commissioners purchased farmland after World War II to build new homes and a recreation area with a large park containing a stadium with the first ever banked cycle track which was opened by Reg Harris, World Champion Sprint Cyclist and Britain's Sportsman of the Year, on 19 June 1951. The park cost ¬£50,000 to build. The stadium is no longer used for cycling. Glens =Groudle Glen= Little Isabella Groudle Glen and Molly Quirk's Glen. They meet at the Whitebridge, at the northern edge of the village on the main A2 coast road to Laxey. Groudle Glen extends right down to the coast and has been described as one of the most spectacular of all the island's glens. It was developed in the 1890s as a pleasure glen, with trees planted and long winding paths added. A bandstand, swings and various other minor attractions were also added. On the rocky headland, a small inlet had been dammed off to form a deep pool, which became the centre of the small headland zoo which exhibited sea lions and polar bears. To get visitors out to the highland zoo, the glen owners built a miniature railway. Today, the attractions have all but disappeared apart from the Groudle Glen Railway, which still runs during the summer months operated by a group of local railway enthusiasts, who in the 1980s completely re-built the line after it was closed and ripped up in the early 1960s. =Molly Quirk's Glen= Molly Quirk's Glen was reputedly named after a woman who was murdered in her cottage. The glen covers about . At the far end of the glen the Clypse and Kerrowdhoo reservoirs now have a series of footpaths and ancient tracks for walkers. =Bibaloe Glen= Bibaloe Glen was named after a ford at the bottom of Whitebridge Hill. =Raad Ny Foillan= The Raad ny Foillan (Way of the Gull) long distance coastal footpath opened in 1986, and runs along the coast in the village. It starts at Port Jack where it connects with Douglas, and runs as far as Howstrake Head before continuing into the neighbouring parish of Lonan. Onchan wetlands Marsh marigold The Onchan wetlands () is a nature reserve in Onchan village that contains a variety of habitats. The site was donated to the Manx Wildlife Trust in 1988 and is open to the public for viewing and has a footpath which is suitable for wheelchair users. The site contains curragh (wetlands - willow scrub), broadleaved trees, dub (pond), neutral grassland and embankments of tall grassland. This variety of habitats leads to a diversity of wildlife and plant life. Some of the plants and trees that grow in the wetlands are silver birch, ash, holly, rowan, marsh marigold, yellow flag, reed canary grass, hemlock water-dropwort, woody nightshade and cuckoo flower. Birds recorded on the site are the grey wagtail, goldcrest, woodcock, chiffchaff and hen harrier along with invertebrates and bats. There are also many frogs and spawn in early summer. Societies Onchan Silver Band is a community-based fourth section brass band. It was founded in 1937.

The village takes its name from the former Chapel of St Mary () which is thought to have overlooked Chapel Bay in the village. Its population is 1,953 according to the 2011 census. In the 19th century it was sometimes called Port-le-Murray.GB Historical GIS / University of Portsmouth, History of Port St Mary, in and the Isle of Man  Map and description, A Vision of Britain through Time. Geography and communications Port St Mary harbour from Bay View Road in 2006 prior to the destruction of the original Alfred Pier light.Port St Mary is located in the south-western part of the island, near Port Erin. A railway station is just north of the village, one of the stops on the surviving section of the Isle of Man Railway between Douglas and Port Erin. Steam trains operate on the line several times a day during the summer season, and stop at Port St Mary. The village is served by Bus Vannin services to Port Erin, Castletown, Douglas and Onchan. Recreation Chapel BayOnce a fishing and trading port, the village is still popular with tourists and fishermen, especially during the summer. The inner harbour, with its pier created in 1812, is tidal and dries out from half-tide. The outer harbour, created when the Alfred Pier was built in 1882, is accessible at all tide states - unique amongst the Manx ports. The Royal National Lifeboat Institution has had a lifeboat and station in Port St Mary since 1896. The current lifeboat, the Gough Ritchie II, lies to a permanent floating mooring inside the outer breakwater. The village is home to the Port St Mary Golf Links, the Island's sole 9-hole golf course, and also , a primary school opened in 1993-1994. The Isle of Man Yacht Club is also based at Port St Mary harbour. Chapel Bay, a sandy beach in the upper part of the village, is used for recreation and bathing in the summer months. Churches and other notable buildings Port St Mary Town Hall is an imposing stone building situated on the village's Victorian promenade at the upper end of the village and houses local government offices and a tourist information point, as well as the hall itself, which is used for performances and community gatherings and is available for private hire. The building is thought to stand on the site of the original . The Anglican St Mary's Church lies in the centre of the village and is a chapel of ease dedicated to Mary of Nazareth lying in the parish of Rushen and diocese of Sodor and Man. Just north of St Mary's is the Port St Mary site of the Living Hope Community Church (formerly known as Port St Mary Baptist Church). The current church building was built in the early 2000s on the site of the former Port St Mary Wesleyan Methodist Chapel, which was completed in 1895, closed in 1970 and was demolished in 2000.http://www.isle- of-man.com/manxnotebook/methdism/chapels/psmary.htm In the lower part of the village, near the port, lies the current Port St Mary Methodist Chapel, built in 1903 as a Primitive Methodist chapel and known as Mount Tabor. Another smaller former Wesleyan chapel, on the High Street, opened in 1835 and was demolished in the 1970s, with the village's garden of remembrance and war memorial occupying the site. Port St Mary is served by St Columba's Catholic Church, which lies just outside the village and is shared with Port Erin. It is a chapel of ease in the parish of St Mary's with St Columba's in the Archdiocese of Liverpool. There are two pubs in Port St Mary - the Albert and The Railway Station, the Bay View Hotel having closed a number of years ago. The Railway Station Pub being adjacent to Port St Mary railway station on the main road to Port Erin. A small 1860s \\"pepperpot\\" lighthouse of the end of Alfred Pier was destroyed in a storm on the night of 11/12 January 2009. It was replaced by a temporary beacon until a permanent replacement was constructed in 2018 although there is some controversy over whether it can withstand a storm. National Dunkirk Memorial To commemorate the 70th anniversary of her sinking, the starboard anchor of Mona's Queen, an Isle of Man Steam Packet Company vessel lost off Dunkirk during Operation Dynamo on which many seamen from the Port St Mary area served, was raised on 29 May 2010 and returned to the Isle of Man to form the centerpiece of a permanent memorial. On 29 May 2012, a memorial featuring the restored anchor and commemorating the losses in 1940 of Mona's Queen, King Orry and Fenella was opened in a ceremony at Kallow Point in Port St Mary, attended by representatives of local and national government, the Lieutenant Governor, the Isle of Man Steam Packet Company and the French Navy. Local government Port St Mary became a village district for local government purposes in 1890, for which Port St Mary Commissioners are responsible. The local government district is adjacent to the village district of Port Erin and the parish of Rushen.Port St Mary Town Hall It was claimed in Tynwald on 18 July 2018 that \\"it appears that Port St Mary Commissioners lurch inelegantly from one crisis to another\\".Tynwald Hansard 18 July 2018  Famous people  * Colonel John Dale Lace (1859 in Port St Mary ‚Äì 1937 near Johannesburg) was a South African gold and diamond mining magnate.

Today, a marker buoy shows the extent of the breakwater, and the landward end is still clearly discernible. To the north-east, by the A7 road, are the earthwork remains of a motte-and-bailey castle known as Cronk Howe Mooar, possibly the site of a timber fortification built by Magnus Barelegs [Barefoot] c. 1100. The oldest building in the village is known as ‚Äúwhite cottage‚Äù or ‚ÄúChristians cottage‚Äù was built by William Christian and his family in 1781. The Christian family still own that cottage today. During WWII it was the location of Port Erin Women's Detention Camp. Transport Bus Vannin Depot =Road= Port Erin is linked to the rest of the island by three roads: * A5 Shore Road (the coast road, as the name implies) east towards Castletown * A7, the inland road leading east towards Ballabeg and Ballasalla * A36, leading north through a sparsely-populated area towards Foxdale and Glenmaye. =Railway= The steam railway station forms the western terminus of the Isle of Man Railway and sits in the centre of the village. The station is built of distinctive red Ruabon brick in an unusual design specifically to fit into its diagonal site between the platforms and the nearby road. The station is now a fraction of its original size, with the former bay platform and sidings now occupied by the storage yard for Bus Vannin, whilst an additional area once used for maintenance has been replaced by The Haven public house. More recent developments have seen the platform shortened and a carriage shed constructed in the yard, capable of storing eight carriages. Prior to this the rolling stock was stored in the open. =Buses= Bus services operate directly via a stop outside the village's railway station to the island's capital Douglas via Port St Mary, Colby, Castletown, Ronaldsway Airport and Ballasalla, using route numbers 1, 2, 11 and 12; these run about every twenty minutes on weekdays and Saturdays, with a less frequent service on Sundays and after 6.00pm. Some of these services (1c and 11b) use an alternative coastal route. The route is the island's busiest, partly because it calls at the island's airport. A late evening service also operates on Friday and Saturday evenings, called the Night Owl (Hullaid Oie), which charges higher fares. There are also occasional buses to Peel (Service No. 8) via Foxdale; all these buses are within the island's transport network Bus Vannin, a government-run service which replaced the railway-operated Isle Of Man Road Services in 1976, itself a subsidiary of the railway. =Other= There is a coach park to the rear of the railway station, formerly occupied by Tours (Isle Of Man) Limited, though more often used by visiting coaches in recent times. A number of private taxi services operate from the village into the later hours, though other Douglas- based hackneys will serve the south on demand. Geography The beach is sandy and is on a bay bounded by two headlands which (on windy days) funnel the prevailing westerly wind towards the village. On sunny days, the bay acts as a suntrap. To the north of the promenade is Bradda Glen, one of the Manx National Glens. The northern headland, Bradda Head, has an iconic memorial tower called Milner's Tower. The promenade, on the east side of the bay, is somewhat higher than the seafront, and primarily consists of hotels, mostly built in the Victorian era, although due to changes in taste among tourists, many of these are being converted into flats and apartments. The town is famed for its views, including spectacular sunsets over Port Erin Bay and Bradda Head, as well as glimpses of the Mourne Mountains in Northern Ireland in the distance. Religion St Catherine's Church Church Road Methodist Church (Background) Droghadfayle Road = Church of England = The largest church in the village is dedicated to St Catherine and located on Church Road at its junction with the upper promenade and lies within its own grounds; in addition to regular community services the church is also well known for its summer concert series that runs on a Wednesday evening throughout the summer months from May to September, featuring local talent. = Methodist = This church is at the junction of Droghadfayle Road with the main road entering the village, and has a mid-sized, modern built community hall annexed to it which hosts the Over Sixties club regularly in addition to services. To the rear of the church lies the village's branch of the Royal British Legion in the same cluster of buildings. = Grace Baptist = Constructed in 1982 at the same time and in a similar architectural style to a surrounding housing estate, this church began life in neighbouring Castletown before relocating and expanding its current headquarters in 1985; since this time the building has also been modified and expanded subject to demand. = Catholic = Found on the outskirts of the village on the main road to Port St Mary, another modern build small church with its own parking area; it can be found at the same site as the community gospel church. It is dedicated to St Columba and was built in 1923 to replace a temporary chapel on the shore line beneath the Bellevue Hotel previously used as a marine biology station and converted to a chapel in 1903. In 1989 the building was extended and re-orientated to provide a larger church with a church hall. = Free Presbyterian= Located at the same site as the Catholic Church, this is a further modern-build small church. It was founded in 1991 and later came under the auspices of the Free Presbyterian Church of Ulster. This is one of the only churches on the island which continues to use exclusively the King James Version of the Bible. It is titled as Port Erin Gospel Church and has an emphasis on evangelism with people travelling over from Ulster regularly to oversee the work.

It is above the promenade on the road leading to the golf course. * Lifeboat Station, on the south side of Port Erin Bay. Extended in recent years, it retains its slipway and deco architectural style, and is open to the public when manned. * Police Station, closed in 2014. The closest manned police station is in Castletown. A public desk is located here. * White Cottage, or Christians Cottage, was built by the Christian family on Shore Road in 1781. Above the door is a plaque that says: \\"Edmund and Margaret Christian, 1781\\". The Christian family still own the cottage today and it remains the oldest building in the village. Notable residents * Nigel Mansell (born 1953) Formula 1 racing driver, was one of the more famous residents during most of his F1 career when he lived on the headland to the north of the bay. He left in 1995.BBC Sport MotorSport website 20 December 2007 retrieved 11 October 2017 Films The 2006 film Stormbreaker, starring Ewan McGregor, was filmed on Port Erin beach; the village has also been used by various production companies including the BBC whose serialised drama The Ginger Tree was filmed at the railway station in 1989, and the cinematic adaptation of Five Children & It. An episode of the BBC documentary marking 20 years since the end of steam trains in the UK, The Train Now Departing, filmed extensive scenes in and around the station, interviewing the station master. The village has also featured in the holiday series Wish You Were Here...? and Holiday '91 with Judith Chalmers. In 2011 an episode of the British TV documentary Coast was filmed here.

The alloys may also contain tungsten or molybdenum and a small but important amount of carbon. History Stellite is a trademarked name of Kennametal Inc.Formerly Deloro Stellite Group. Acquired by Kennametal Inc. on March 1, 2012. Prior to that it was owned by Union Carbide, Stellite Division.Haynes International - Our Company History Invented by Elwood Haynes\\"The WPI International Corporate Leaders Roundtable: The Impact of Evolving Technologies on the Future of Business: Notable Achievements of Alumni of Worcester Polytechnic Institute\\" . Elwood Haynes, Class of 1881. in the early 1900s as a material for making cutlery that wouldn't stain or require constant cleaning. Composition Stellite alloys are composed of various amounts of cobalt, nickel, iron, aluminium, boron, carbon, chromium, manganese, molybdenum, phosphorus, sulfur, silicon, and titanium, in various proportions; most alloys contain four to six of these elements. Properties Stellite is a family of completely non-magnetic and corrosion-resistant cobalt alloys of various compositions that have been optimised for different uses. The alloy currently most suited for cutting tools, for example, is Stellite 100, because this alloy is quite hard, maintains a good cutting edge at high temperature, and resists hardening and annealing. Other alloys are formulated to maximize combinations of wear resistance, corrosion resistance, or ability to withstand extreme temperatures. Stellite alloys display outstanding hardness and toughness, and are also usually very resistant to corrosion. Typically, a Stellite part is precisely cast so that only minimal machining is necessary. Due to the very high hardness many alloys of Stellite are primarily machined by grinding, as cutting operations in some alloys cause significant tool wear even with carbide inserts. The alloys also tend to have extremely high melting points due to the cobalt and chromium content. Applications Typical applications include saw teeth, hardfacing, and acid-resistant machine parts. Stellite was a major improvement in the production of poppet valves and valve seats for the valves, particularly exhaust valves, of internal combustion engines. By reducing their erosion from hot gases, the interval between maintenance and re-grinding of their seats was dramatically lengthened. The first third of the M2HB machine gun and M60 machine gun barrels (starting from the chamber) are lined with Stellite. The locking lugs and shoulders of Voere Titan II rifles were also made of Stellite. In the early 1980s, experiments were done in the United Kingdom to make artificial hip joints and other bone replacements out of precision-cast Stellite alloys. It is also widely used for making the cast structure of dental prostheses. Stellite has also been used in the manufacture of turning tools for lathes. With the introduction and improvements in tipped tools it is not used as often, but it was found to have superior cutting properties compared to the early carbon steel tools and even some high speed steel tools, especially against difficult materials such as stainless steel. Care was needed in grinding the blanks and these were marked at one end to show the correct orientation, without which the cutting edge could chip prematurely. While Stellite remains the material of choice for certain internal parts in industrial process valves (valve seat hardfacing), its use has been discouraged in nuclear power plants. In piping that can communicate with the reactor, tiny amounts of Stellite would be released into the process fluid and eventually enter the reactor. There the cobalt would be activated by the neutron flux in the reactor and become cobalt-60, a radioisotope with a five year half life that releases very energetic gamma rays. This phenomenon is more problematic in boiling water reactor (BWR) plants, since the steam is in direct contact with both the reactor and the steam turbine. Pressurized water reactor (PWR) designs are less susceptible. While not a hazard to the general public, about a third to a half of nuclear worker exposures could be traced to the use of Stellite and to trace amounts of cobalt in stainless steels. Replacements for Stellite have been developed by the industry, such as the Electric Power Research Institute's \\"NOREM\\", that provide acceptable performance without cobalt. Since the United States nuclear power industry has begun to replace the Stellite valve seat hardfacing in the late 1970s and to tighten specifications of cobalt in stainless steels, worker exposures due to cobalt-60 have dropped significantly. Stellite was also used as the cage material for the first commercially available artificial heart valve, the Starr-Edwards caged-ball valve, first implanted in 1960.

He served as the first President of Lithuania from 4 April 1919 to 19 June 1920. He again served as the last President of the country from 19 December 1926 to 15 June 1940, before its occupation by the Soviet Union. He was also one of the most prominent ideologists of nationalism in Lithuania. Early life and education Smetona was born on in the village of U≈æulƒónis, Kovno Governorate, Russian Empire, to a family of farmers ‚Äì former serfs of the Taujƒónai Manor, which belonged to the Radziwi≈Ç≈Ç family. Researcher Kazimieras Gasparaviƒçius has traced Smetona's patrilineal ancestry to Laurentijus who was born around 1695 and lived near Raguva. Smetona was the eighth of nine children. His parents were hardworking people who managed to double their inherited . His father was literate and Smetona learned to read at home. Smetona as a student of the university's Faculty of Law His father died in 1885 when Smetona was only 11 years old and, despite financial difficulties, a year later Smetona ‚Äì the only of his siblings ‚Äì was sent to the primary school in Taujƒónai where instruction was in Russian due to the Lithuanian press ban. This was his dying father's request. His mother hoped that Smetona would become a priest. After graduation in 1889, Smetona wanted to continue his education, but gymnasiums admitted pupils only up to the age of 12 and he was already 15 years old. Therefore, he was forced to study privately in Ukmergƒó in order to catch up and be able to pass examinations to enter the fourth class of gymnasium. In summer 1891, he attempted to gain admission to the LiepƒÅja Gymnasium as his brother Motiejus worked in a factory in LiepƒÅja. He was refused and instead applied to the Palanga Pre-Gymnasium, which had no age restrictions. Smetona was an exemplary student (one of the top two students) and received a tuition waiver. As a superintendent of a student dormitory, he also received free housing and was able to support himself by providing private lessons. Three other future signatories of the Act of Independence of Lithuania attended the Pro-Gymnasium at the same time: Steponas Kairys, Jurgis ≈†aulys, and Kazimieras Steponas ≈†aulys. As Palanga was close to East Prussia, it was easier to obtain Lithuanian literature, which was banned by the Tsarist authorities. Smetona began reading Lithuanian periodicals and books, including a history of Lithuania by Maironis. After graduation in 1893, according to his family's wishes, he passed his entrance examinations for the Samogitian Diocesan Seminary in Kaunas. However, he felt no great calling for priesthood and enrolled at the Jelgava Gymnasium in Latvia. This was a cultural hub of the Lithuanian National Revival and attracted many future leaders in Lithuanian culture and politics, including Juozas T≈´belis and Vladas Mironas who later became Smetona's political companions. In particular, Lithuanian language and culture was openly promoted by the linguist, Jonas Jablonskis, teacher of Greek, with whom Smetona developed a close professional relationship. Jablonskis visited Smetona's native village collecting data on Lithuanian dialects. Smetona met his future wife, Sofija Chodakauskaitƒó, through Jablonskis who recommended him as tutor for her brother. Smetona portrait taken in Vilnius before the World War I In fall 1896, the administration of the Jelgava Gymnasium forced the Lithuanian students to recite their prayers in Russian while Latvian and German students were allowed to use their native languages. Smetona and other students refused and were expelled. Most later agreed to pray in Russian and were re-admitted, but a handful who refused were prohibited from attending any other school. The students sent petitions to Pope Leo XIII and Ivan Delyanov, Minister of National Education. Smetona and two others, and Petras Vaiciu≈°ka, managed to secure an audience with Delyanov who allowed the Lithuanians to pray in Latin and the expelled students to continue their education. Smetona did not return to Jelgava and finished up at Gymnasium No. 9 in Saint Petersburg. Upon graduation in 1897, Smetona entered the Faculty of Law of the University of Saint Petersburg. He was more interested in history and languages, but knew that as a Catholic his choices were limited to priest, lawyer, or doctor if he wanted to work in Lithuania. Saint Petersburg, with a direct railway connection to Lithuania, was becoming a Lithuanian cultural center. Smetona joined and chaired a secret Lithuanian student organization; he was later succeeded by Steponas Kairys. He also joined a Lithuanian choir led by ƒåeslovas Sasnauskas, organist at the Church of St. Catherine. Smetona was exposed to socialist ideas and even read Marx's Capital, but resolutely rejected them. He was expelled from the university, imprisoned for two weeks, and deported to Vilnius for participating in the February 1899 student protests. It was the first time Smetona visited the city, the historical capital of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, and it left a deep impression on him. A month later, he was allowed to return to the university. In 1898, Smetona and his roommate, , using a mimeograph printed about 100 copies of a brief Lithuanian grammar written by Petras Avi≈æonis based on the German-language writings of . This grammar was insufficient for Lithuanian needs and in summer 1900 Jonas Jablonskis set out to work on his Lithuanian grammar. He was assisted by Avi≈æonis, ≈Ωemaitƒó, and Smetona, though Smetona mostly edited works of Bishop Motiejus Valanƒçius. The grammar was published in 1901 and became a fundamental work in establishing the standard Lithuanian language. In early 1902, the police began investigating a network of Lithuanian book smugglers and raided Smetona's room where they found several prohibited Lithuanian publications. He was imprisoned in the Vyborg Castle, but managed to secure acquittal and graduate that spring. Early activities After his graduation from the University in 1902, he moved to Vilnius and worked at the Vilnius Land Bank until 1915. He became an active participant in Lithuanian cultural life and, up until becoming President in December 1926, devoted substantial amounts of time and effort to the Lithuanian press. Two years later, he married Sofija Chodakauskaitƒó in the Church of St. Raphael the Archangel in Vilnius. From his very first days in Vilnius, Smetona became involved in the activities of various Lithuanian nationalist groups, and joined the Lithuanian Democratic Party, which he represented in the Great Seimas of Vilnius. He was later elected to its Presidium. In 1904 and 1907, he was on the staff of the Lithuanian newspaper, Vilniaus ≈æinios (The Vilnius News). In 1905‚Äì1906, he edited the weekly Lietuvos ≈´kininkas (The Lithuanian Farmer). In 1907, Smetona and the Rev. Juozas Tumas-Vai≈ægantas established a venture to print the newspaper Viltis (The Hope), and started publishing and circulating it. In Viltis, Smetona advocated national unity. He was also one of the incorporators of the Au≈°ra (Dawn) company for the publishing of Lithuanian books, a member of the Lithuanian Mutual Aid Society of Vilnius, the Lithuanian Learned Society, the Vilniaus au≈°ra (The Dawn of Vilnius), and Rytas (The Morning) education societies, the R≈´ta Art Society and many other societies, and taught the Lithuanian language at Vilnius schools. In 1914, he started publishing Vairas (The Rudder), a new bi-weekly magazine. Politics Smetona (first right from center) in the Council of Lithuania During the First World War, he was the First Vice-Chairman, and later Chairman, of the Central Committee of the Lithuanian Relief Society for helping victims of the war. In the summer of 1916, Antanas Smetona, together with other Lithuanians from Vilnius, presented a memorandum to the German Commander-in-Chief of the Eastern Front, in which they demanded the right of the Lithuanian nation to have an independent State. On 6 September 1917, he started printing the newspaper, Lietuvos Aidas (Lithuania's Echo), working as its publisher and its editor-in-chief. In the first issue of the newspaper, Smetona wrote that the most important goal of the Lithuanian nation was the re-establishment of an independent Lithuanian state. Between 18 and 22 September 1917, he participated in the Lithuanian Conference in Vilnius, and was elected Chairman (1917‚Äì1919) of the Council of Lithuania (later Council of the State). On 16 February 1918, Antanas Smetona signed the Act of Independence of Lithuania. Between December 1918 and March 1919, he lived primarily in Germany and the Scandinavian countries, soliciting loans for the cause of Lithuanian independence. On 4 April 1919, the State Council of Lithuania elected Smetona the first President of the Republic of Lithuania. On 19 April 1920, the Constituent Assembly elected Aleksandras Stulginskis President. Not re-elected to the Seimas, from 1921 to 1924, he edited several periodicals, including Lietuvos balsas (Voice of Lithuania), Lietuvi≈°kas balsas (Lithuanian Voice) and Vairas. Smetona (center) with ministers After the Klaipƒóda Revolt of January 1923, in the Memelland, which had been separated from Germany, he was made commissioner there on 20 February, but, due to disagreements with Prime Minister Ernestas Galvanauskas, he resigned from his post. In November 1923, authorities imprisoned Smetona for several days for publishing an article by Augustinas Voldemaras in Vairas. Between 1923 and 1927, he was an assistant Professor at the University of Lithuania - at first in the Chair of Art Theory and History and later at the Department of Philosophy. He lectured on ethics, ancient philosophy and Lithuanian linguistics. In 1932, he was awarded an honorary Ph.D. at the Vytautas Magnus University. Smetona participated in the activity of the Lithuanian Riflemen's Union that had staged the Klaipƒóda Revolt, which gave him greater name-recognition. More than once, he was elected to its central board. Between 1924 and 1940, he was the vice-Chairman of the Board of the International Bank. =Authoritarian president= Bas-relief of Antanas Smetona by sculptor, medalist Juozas Kalinauskas initiating soldiers to the Lithuanian Armed Forces Antanas Smetona inspects the Lithuanian Armed Forces soldiers Interwar 10 litas coin featuring President Smetona by pre-war sculptor Juozas Zikaras Smetona was one of the leaders of the coup d'√©tat of 1926, which deposed President Kazys Grinius. He once again became President on 19 December of that year (two others briefly held the office during the coup, which began on 17 December, before Smetona was formally restored to the Presidency). He designated Augustinas Voldemaras as Prime Minister. One year later, he suppressed the parliament and, on 15 May 1928, with the approval of the government, he promulgated a new constitution with more extensive presidential powers. In 1929, he removed Voldemaras and assumed dictatorial powers. For the next nine years, Smetona ruled by decree, without a parliament; his new constitution vested him with both executive and legislative powers when the Seimas was not in session. He was re-elected President in 1931 and 1938, both times as the only candidate. The Seimas was not reconvened until 1936; even then, it was composed entirely of Smetona's adherents. In 1938, a third constitution was enacted that retained the general authoritarian character of the 1928 document, and declared that political power in the state was \\"indivisible.\\" He remained in office until 15 June 1940. As a nationalist, Smetona's regime closed many Polish-language schools upon coming to power.Hiden, John and Salmon, Patrick; The Baltic Nations and Europe: Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania in the Twentieth Century; p. 56 The regime repeatedly arrested and imprisoned members of the already-banned Communist Party ‚Äì as with almost all interwar European dictatorships, the threat of Communism was the source of its legitimacy and the regime executed the original leadership five days after coming to power. However, despite propaganda that Communists were a ‚Äúnon-Lithuanian force invading the country‚Äô, they continued to operate underground with growing membership and it is known today that their leaders were ethnically Lithuanian. In 1935, Smetona suffered a blow when farmers in south-east Lithuania organised a strike and refused to sell their products. Reprisals led to five deaths and 456 farmers being arrested. This exacerbated long-standing tensions within his regime between hardliners arguing for more rigid authoritarian control over Lithuanian life, and moderates who wanted liberalisation. These difficulties, however, were already becoming overshadowed by the threat of Nazi Germany. Smetona‚Äôs regime was the first in Europe to put Nazis on trial: as early as 8 February 1934, action had begun against Nazis in the Memel region, which was autonomous within Lithuania. The Smetona regime‚Äôs trial of Ernst Neumann and Freiherr von Sass (July 1934 to March 1935) was the first attempt anywhere to bring Nazis to justice, and saw 76 Hitlerites imprisoned and four sentenced to death ‚Äì though this was commuted to life imprisonment.‚ÄòNazis Escape Death Sentence in Lithuania: President Smetona Changes Sentence to Ward Off Trouble with Germans‚Äô; Reading Eagle, 18 May 1935, p. 1 By 1938, however, Memel was becoming a difficult issue for a regime spending a quarter of its budget on defence and expensive army modernisation, and the Nazis were able to win 26 of 29 seats in elections. The following year, Smetona surrendered Memel to Hitler and declared a state of emergency‚ÄòNazis Celebrate Return of Memel: Germans Sing and Dance While Lithuanians Weep Openly; Refugees Halted‚Äô; The Free-Lance Star (Fredericksburg, Virginia); 22 March 1939, p. 1 ‚Äì he never lost his distaste for Hitler and Nazism, having been so discredited by the loss of Memel that members of the Lithuanian political opposition were appointed to his cabinet to try recovering credibility and domestic stability. Smetona‚Äôs government was cautious about industrialisation, as its support base lay in the dominant rural population. As dictator, Smetona did nothing to encourage direct foreign investment, which remained extremely limited throughout his rule. Nonetheless, during Smetona‚Äòs dictatorship, Lithuania did advance economically: industrial output ‚Äì mainly directed to domestic demand ‚Äì when he was overthrown by the Soviet invasion was twice what it had been before the coup that brought him to power, and the country‚Äôs transport network had been greatly improved by the construction of railways from ≈†iauliai to Klaipƒóda and from Kaunas to the south and north-east. In contrast, Smetona was more generous in support for the agricultural sector, which at the time provided almost all of Lithuania‚Äôs exports despite occasionally protesting against the regime. =Soviet occupation= Lithuania was occupied by Soviet troops in 1940, as a consequence of the 1939 Molotov‚ÄìRibbentrop Pact between Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union. After the USSR presented an ultimatum to Lithuania in June of that year, Smetona proposed armed resistance against the Soviets. The majority of the government and the commanders of the army did not concur, believing that the country was not capable of effective resistance with Soviet troops stationed inside Lithuania.van Voren, Robert; Undigested Past: The Holocaust in Lithuania, p. 24 On 15 June, Smetona turned his presidential duties to Prime Minister Antanas Merkys on an interim basis according to the constitution. Before leaving the Presidential Palace in Kaunas, Smetona said: \\"I do not want to make Lithuania a bolshevik country with my own hands.\\" He believed that by leaving the country, he would be in a position to do more for the country's sake by leading a government in exile instead of becoming a Soviet marionette. He firstly fled to Germany with his family. Shortly afterwards, the Smetonas fled to Switzerland. A day after Smetona left the country, Merkys announced he had deposed Smetona and was now president in his own right. Two days later, Merkys was pressured into appointing the more pliant Justas Paleckis as prime minister and resigning himself. Paleckis then became acting president, and was used as a puppet to oversee the final stages of Lithuania being incorporated into the Soviet Union a month later. Lithuania's current official position on the matter is that Merkys' takeover of the presidency was illegal, since Smetona never formally resigned. Lithuanian officials thus do not recognize Merkys or Paleckis as legitimate presidents, and contend that all subsequent actions leading up to the Soviet annexation were ipso facto void. Flight abroad Presidential umbrella with monogram A. S., medalion with his wife Sofija Smetonienƒó, plate with Smetona's picture, Swiss watch On the morning of 15 June, just after the government decided to accept the Soviet ultimatum, Smetona began making hasty preparations for fleeing the country. He was accompanied by his wife, his son and daughter and their spouses and children, Kazys Musteikis, former Minister of Defense, and two presidential adjutants. Smetona departed Kaunas at about 3 pm that day. They stopped in Kybartai on the border with Nazi Germany. Smetona and Musteikis attempted to summon the 9th Infantry Regiment from Marijampolƒó to protect them and to offer at least symbolic resistance to the Red Army, but the regiment was stopped by a delegation sent from Kaunas to retrieve the president. Smetona decided to cross the border without delay, but Lithuanian border guards would not allow him to pass. Around midnight, a local man led Smetona, his bodyguard and adjutant across the shallow Liepona stream. With Smetona already on the other side, his family managed to convince border guards to let them through at about 6 am. On the German side, Smetona was met by , a Gestapo officer. Via K√∂nigsberg, the refugees were moved to a hunting lodge near the (Schwenzait) lake in the Masurian Lake District. On 17 August, Smetona received permission to relocate to Berlin where he settled on the . There, he was carefully supervised and allowed to communicate only with a Lithuanian representative, Kazys ≈†kirpa. The Germans did not allow him to make any political moves so as not to upset the Soviet Union. It was clear that Smetona's presence was not desirable. On 4 September, Smetona officially petitioned the Embassy of the United States in Berlin for U.S. visas. The request was granted, but only on the condition that, while Smetona was in the U.S., he would not be considered the leader or representative of any state or government. It was a humiliating condition, but Smetona accepted it and departed to Bern, Switzerland on 18 September. Musteikis stayed in Berlin. In Bern, Smetona met with members of the Lithuanian Diplomatic Service, ambassadors and diplomats who continued to represent pre-occupation Lithuania. They hoped to establish a government-in-exile via the National Committee chaired by former Prime Minister Ernestas Galvanauskas. Smetona saw no need for such a committee and criticized the choice of Galvanauskas. The diplomats were also not receptive to Smetona ‚Äì he had no funds, authority or political influence. Nevertheless, Smetona signed the so-called Kybartai Act ‚Äì a backdated document supposedly written in Kybartai before his exile. The Act dismissed Antanas Merkys and appointed Stasys Lozoraitis as both Prime Minister and acting President. This controversial document was never used in practice. Smetona departed Bern for Lisbon in January 1941. He stayed in Monte Estoril, at the Pens√£o Zenith.Exiles Memorial Center. He left for Brazil aboard the Serpa Pinto, arriving in Rio de Janeiro on 14 February. He was met by local officials and Lithuanian emigrants, and had a meeting with Get√∫lio Vargas, the President of Brazil. Smetona departed Brazil on 26 February. On 9 or 10 March 1941, Smetona with his wife arrived in New York aboard the SS Argentina. He was greeted by about 30 American journalists and photographers as well as Lithuanian-American representatives. He was escorted to The Pierre hotel where an evening function with about 400 guests was held on 13 March. Since Smetona was a private individual in the United States, the gathering did not include any members of U.S. organizations. They lived temporarily at the Embassy of Lithuania in Washington, D.C., but their relationship with the representative Povilas ≈Ωadeikis was tense. Smetona then lived in Pittsburgh and Chicago before settling in Cleveland, Ohio in May 1942 with his son's family. While in exile, he began work on a history of Lithuania and on his memoirs. Smetona died in a fire at his son‚Äôs house in Cleveland on 9 January 1944,‚ÄòAntanas Smetona Dies in Fire: President of Lithuania Dies in Cleveland; Fled Country on Russian Occupation‚Äô; The Montreal Gazette; 10 January 1944, p. 19 and was buried there. His wife Sofija died in Cleveland on 28 December 1968. The couple were survived by their daughter, Birutƒó. In 1975, his remains were moved from Cleveland's Knollwood Cemetery mausoleum to All Souls Cemetery in Chardon, Ohio.‚ÄúAntanas Smetona‚Äù. Find-A-Grave. URL accessed 26 September 2006.

In biochemistry, hydroxylation reactions are often facilitated by enzymes called hydroxylases. Hydroxylation is the first step in the oxidative degradation of organic compounds in air. It is extremely important in detoxification since hydroxylation converts lipophilic compounds into water-soluble (hydrophilic) products that are more readily removed by the kidneys or liver and excreted. Some drugs (for example, steroids) are activated or deactivated by hydroxylation. Biological hydroxylation The hydroxylation process involves conversion of a CH group into a COH group. Hydroxylation is an oxidative process. The oxygen that is inserted into the C-H bond is usually derived from atmospheric oxygen (O2). Since O2 itself is a slow and unselective hydroxylating agent, catalysts are required to accelerate the pace of the process and to introduce selectivity. The principal hydroxylation agent in nature is cytochrome P-450, hundreds of variations of which are known. Other hydroxylating agents include flavins, alpha- ketoglutarate-dependent hydroxylases, and some diiron hydroxylases.Nelson, D. L.; Cox, M. M. \\"Lehninger, Principles of Biochemistry\\" 3rd Ed. Worth Publishing: New York, 2000. . Steps in an oxygen rebound mechanism that explains many iron-catalyzed hydroxylations: H-atom abstraction, oxygen rebound, alcohol decomplexation. Of proteins The hydroxylation of proteins occurs as a post-translational modification, and is catalyzed by 2-oxoglutarate-dependent dioxygenases. When molecules are hydroxylated, they become more water‚Äêsoluble, which affects their structure and function. It can take place on several amino acids, like lysine, asparagine, aspartate and histidine, but the most frequently hydroxylated amino acid residue in human proteins is proline. This is due to the fact that collagen makes up about 25‚Äì35% of the protein in our bodies and contains a hydroxyproline at almost every 3rd residue in its amino acid sequence. Collagen consists of both 3‚Äêhydroxyproline and 4‚Äêhydroxyproline residues. Hydroxylation occurs at the Œ≥-C atom, forming hydroxyproline (Hyp), which stabilizes the secondary structure of collagen due to the strong electronegative effects of oxygen. Proline hydroxylation is also a vital component of hypoxia response via hypoxia inducible factors. In some cases, proline may be hydroxylated instead on its Œ≤-C atom. Lysine may also be hydroxylated on its Œ¥-C atom, forming hydroxylysine (Hyl). These three reactions are catalyzed by very large, multi- subunit enzymes prolyl 4-hydroxylase, prolyl 3-hydroxylase and lysyl 5-hydroxylase, respectively. These reactions require iron (as well as molecular oxygen and Œ±-ketoglutarate) to carry out the oxidation, and use ascorbic acid (vitamin C) to return the iron to its reduced state. Deprivation of ascorbate leads to deficiencies in proline hydroxylation, which leads to less stable collagen, which can manifest itself as the disease scurvy. Since citrus fruits are rich in vitamin C, British sailors were given limes to combat scurvy on long ocean voyages; hence, they were called \\"limeys\\". Several endogenous proteins contain hydroxyphenylalanine and hydroxytyrosine residues. These residues are formed due to the hydroxylation of phenylalanine and tyrosine, a process in which the hydroxylation converts phenylalanine residues into tyrosine residues. This is very important in living organisms to help them control excess amounts of phenylalanine residues. Hydroxylation of tyrosine residues is also very vital in living organisms because hydroxylation at C-3 of tyrosine creates 3,4- dihydroxy phenylalanine (DOPA), which is a precursor to hormones and can be converted into dopamine. Examples * 17Œ±-Hydroxylase * Cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase * Dopamine Œ≤-hydroxylase * Phenylalanine hydroxylase * Tyrosine hydroxylase * One example of non- biological hydroxylation is the hydrogen peroxide hydroxylation of phenol to form hydroquinone.

Biography Georges de Rham was born on 10 September 1903 in Roche, a small village in the canton of Vaud in Switzerland. He was the fifth born of the six children in the family of L√©on de Rham, a constructions engineer. Georges de Rham grew up in Roche but went to school in nearby Aigle, the main town of the district, travelling daily by train. By his own account, he was not an extraordinary student in school, where he mainly enjoyed painting and dreamed of becoming a painter. In 1919 he moved with his family to Lausanne in a rented apartment in Beaulieu Castle where he would live for the rest of his life. Georges de Rham started the Gymnasium in Lausanne with a focus on humanities, following his passion for literature and philosophy but learning little mathematics. On graduating from the Gymnasium in 1921 however, he decided not to continue with the Faculty of Letters in order to avoid Latin. He opted instead for the Faculty of Sciences of the University of Lausanne. At the faculty he started out studying biology, physics and chemistry and no mathematics initially. While trying to learn some mathematics by himself as a tool for physics, his interest was raised and by the third year he abandoned biology to focus decisively on mathematics.Georges de Rham speech on receiving the Prize of the City of Lausanne (1979), cited in Burlet (2004) page 5 At the University he was mainly influenced by two professors, Gustave Dumas and Dmitry Mirimanoff, who guided him in studying the works of √âmile Borel, Ren√©- Louis Baire, Henri Lebesgue and Joseph Serret. After graduating in 1925, de Rham remained at the University of Lausanne as an assistant to Dumas. Starting work towards completing his doctorate, he read the works of Henri Poincar√© on topology on the advice of Dumas. Although he found inspiration for a thesis subject in Poincar√©, progress was slow as topology was a relatively new topic and access to the relevant literature was difficult in Lausanne. With the recommendation of Dumas, de Rham contacted Lebesgue and went to Paris for a few months in 1926 and, again, for a few months in 1928. Both trips were financed by his own savings and he spent his time in Paris taking classes and studying at the University of Paris and the Coll√®ge de France. Lebesgue provided de Rham with a lot of help in this period, both with his studies and supporting his first research publications. When he finished his thesis Lebesgue advised him to send it to √âlie Cartan and, in 1931, De Rham received his doctorate from the University of Paris before a commission led by Cartan and including Paul Montel and Gaston Julia as examiners. In 1932 de Rham returned to the University of Lausanne as an extraordinary professor. In 1936 he also became a professor at the University of Geneva and continued to hold both positions in parallel until his retirement in 1971. de Rham was also one of the best mountaineers in Switzerland. As a member of the Independent High Mountain Group of Lausanne since 1944, he opened several difficult routes, some of them in the Valais Alps (such as the south ridge of the Stockhorn from Baltschieder) and Vaud Alps (such as L'Argentine and Pacheu). In 1944 he wrote a complete climbing guidebook of the Miroir d'Argentine, where he climbed routes until 1980. According John Milnor, in 1933 de Rham encountered on one of his hikes James Alexander and Hassler Whitney, who were climbing together near the Weisshorn in Valais; this meeting was the beginning of a more than 40-year friendship between Whitney and de Rham. Mathematics research In 1931 he proved de Rham's theorem, identifying the de Rham cohomology groups as topological invariants. This proof can be considered as sought-after, since the result was implicit in the points of view of Henri Poincar√© and √âlie Cartan. The first proof of the general Stokes' theorem, for example, is attributed to Poincar√©, in 1899. At the time there was no cohomology theory, one could reasonably say: for manifolds the homology theory was known to be self-dual with the switch of dimension to codimension (that is, from Hk to Hn‚àík, where n is the dimension). That is true, anyway, for orientable manifolds, an orientation being in differential form terms an n-form that is never zero (and two being equivalent if related by a positive scalar field). The duality can be reformulated, to great advantage, in terms of the Hodge dual‚Äîintuitively, 'divide into' an orientation form‚Äîas it was in the years succeeding the theorem. Separating out the homological and differential form sides allowed the coexistence of 'integrand' and 'domains of integration', as cochains and chains, with clarity. De Rham himself developed a theory of homological currents, that showed how this fitted with the generalised function concept. The influence of de Rham‚Äôs theorem was particularly great during the development of Hodge theory and sheaf theory. De Rham also worked on the torsion invariants of smooth manifolds.

He rose to prominence as the chief songwriter, vocalist and guitarist of the rock group Be-Bop Deluxe, which he formed in 1972. Nelson has been described as \\"one of the most underrated guitarists of the seventies art rock movement\\". In 2015, he was recognised with the Visionary award at the Progressive Music Awards. Early life and personal life Nelson was born Wakefield in the West Riding of Yorkshire, to Jean and Walter Nelson. His father was an alto saxophone player who led his own dance band. His mother, Jean, was a member of a dance troupe when younger. Nelson attended local schools in the Wakefield area and in the 1960s went to Wakefield College of Art. Nelson's younger brother, Ian (1956‚Äì2006), collaborated on the Be-Bop Deluxe song \\"Ships in the Night\\" and formed the band Fiat Lux; he also played on the 1979 Red Noise album Sound-on-Sound and with the 2004 touring band Bill Nelson and the Lost Satellites. Nelson has three children, Julia (born 1970 with Bill‚Äôs first wife, Shirley) and Elle (born 1978)Reeves, Paul Sutton Music In Dreamland Bill Nelson & Be-Bop Deluxe (2008) p.152, Helter Skelter publishing and Elliot (born 1981),Reeves, Paul Sutton Music In Dreamland Bill Nelson & Be-Bop Deluxe (2008) p.184, Helter Skelter publishing both born with Bill‚Äôs second wife, Jan. Elle and Elliot played in their own band, Honeytone Cody, between the late 1990s and 2014. Some time around April 1995 Nelson married Emiko, who was previously married to Yellow Magic Orchestra drummer Yukihiro Takahashi. Career =1970s= Nelson was educated at the Wakefield College of Art, where he developed an interest in the work of poet and filmmaker Jean Cocteau. At this time, he was also developing as a musician, drawing upon Duane Eddy as a primary guitar influence. His first record was a brief contribution on the album A-Austr: Musics from Holyground, with Brian Calvert, Chris Coombs, Ted Hepworth, Mike Levon and Brian Wilson. Levon recorded and produced the album which appeared on Levon's own Holyground Records label in 1970. After that, Nelson appeared in a much more substantial role with Lightyears Away on Astral Navigations released in 1971. On one track, \\"Yesterday\\", written by Coombs, Levon recorded Nelson's lead guitars in an acid rock style, supporting Coombs' stylophone riff. This track also gave Nelson his first airplay by John Peel on his national BBC Radio 1 programme in the United Kingdom. Nelson's Holyground recordings were released in February 2001 as Electrotype. In 1973, Nelson's debut solo album Northern Dream, released on his own independent Smile label, drew further attention from Peel which eventually led to Nelson's band Be-Bop Deluxe signing to EMI's Harvest Records subsidiary and releasing Axe Victim in 1974. Nelson replaced the original band members for Futurama in 1975. The lineup of Bill Nelson (guitar), Andrew Clark (keyboards), Charlie Tumahai (bass) and Simon Fox (drums) recorded Sunburst Finish and Modern Music in 1976, the live album Live! In The Air Age in 1977 and their final studio album Drastic Plastic in 1978. Nelson found the structure of a permanent band constricting. An instrumental on Drastic Plastic performed by Nelson (acoustic guitar) and Clark (keyboards) anticipated Nelson's later solo ambient work. Other tracks on that album required Fox record drum parts for use as repeating loop backing tracks in the studio. (Performing these songs live on the subsequent tour, Fox would physically play these repeating patterns on drums). This sowed the seeds for later experimentation by Nelson. 1983's Invisibility Exhibition tour would see Bill Nelson (guitar) and Ian Nelson (sax) improvise to the former's self-produced backing audio (and video) tracks (later released as the Chamber of Dreams album), an approach Nelson would repeat for many solo live performances throughout his career. Playing the guitar over pre-recorded backing tracks would bear further fruit in later studio recordings, notably the Painting With Guitars series (2003, 2015) and And We Fell Into A Dream (2007). In autumn 1978, Nelson halted the Be-Bop Deluxe project, removed Tumahai and Fox from his immediate working band and replaced the name with the moniker Red Noise (releasing the Sound-on-Sound album in February 1979). Harvest, who had insisted on naming it \\"Bill Nelson's Red Noise\\", refused to release the second Red Noise album Quit Dreaming And Get On The Beam which was largely recorded by Nelson with contributions on sax from his brother Ian rather than the more-obviously marketable five-piece band Harvest's execs had understandably expected. It remained unreleased in record company limbo. Meanwhile, with his producer from Harvest John Leckie, Nelson did some production (and, in Nelson's case, sessions keyboards) work for the band Skids, whose guitarist Stuart Adamson was an admirer of Nelson's musicianship.Nelson, Bill diary of a hyperdreamer (2004) p.563 Bill Nelson's collected diaries from between 1999 and 2003, previously published on his official website Pomona Fruitful friendships followed.Nelson, Bill diary of a hyperdreamer (2004) p.369 Bill Nelson's collected diaries from between 1999 and 2003, previously published on his official website Pomona Vocalist Richard Jobson would appear as a support act reading poetry on the Invisibility Exhibition tour. After Adamson's death in 2001, Nelson composed a piece in memory of his departed friend, called simply \\"For Stuart\\",Nelson, Bill diary of a hyperdreamer (2004) Pp.394, 397, 401-3 Bill Nelson's collected diaries from between 1999 and 2003, previously published on his official website Pomona which appeared on 2003's The Romance of Sustain Volume One: Painting With Guitars and (in a live version) on 2011's live at Metropolis Studios DVD. =1980s= Nelson's manager Mark Rye negotiated with Harvest to buy back some of the unreleased songs for Nelson to release under his own name on his own label, Cocteau Records, which Nelson and Rye had set up. Consequently, in July 1980, Nelson was able to release the single \\"Do You Dream in Colour?\\", which after airplay on BBC Radio 1 reached No. 52 in the UK Singles Chart. This debut release on the label persuaded Phonogram to acquire the remaining tracks for Cocteau in order to release Quit Dreaming And Get On The Beam as a Bill Nelson album on their subsidiary label Mercury Records in 1981. The release contained bonus disc Sounding The Ritual Echo (Atmospheres for Dreaming) featuring experimental, ambient instrumentals which Nelson had recorded privately at his home. Subsequent Mercury releases included The Love That Whirls, which included a bonus disc of Nelson's soundtrack for The Yorkshire Actors' stage production of Jean Cocteau's 1946 film La Belle et la B√™te/Beauty and the Beast. Nelson had already contributed music (and released it under the title Das Kabinet on Cocteau) to the same company's similar adaptation of Robert Wiene's 1920 silent film classic The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari. Freed from the demands of a mainstream, commercial record company, Nelson released considerable quantities of singles and LPs on Cocteau throughout the decade, much of it by himself but also a number of singles by other artists, notably Last Man In Europe, A Flock of Seagulls, The Revox Cadets, Richard Jobson, Q (16), Fiat Lux, Man Jumping and Yukihiro Takahashi. The more ambitious Cocteau releases by Nelson himself included the four-LP box set of experimental electronic music Trial by Intimacy (The Book of Splendours) and the later ambient two-LP collection Chance Encounters in the Garden of Lights, which contained music informed by Nelson's Gnostic beliefs. In 1989, he released the 4-CD box set Demonstrations of Affection. He was hired by English new wave artist Gary Numan to produce his 1983 album Warriors, with Numan saying that Bill Nelson was his \\"favourite guitar player, bar none.\\" However, the two musicians failed to maintain a working relationship, and ultimately Nelson chose not to be credited for his production role on the album. Nelson also contributed towards several tracks on David Sylvian's Gone to Earth (1986). Nelson had bad luck with major record labels in the 1980s. A deal with CBS Records' Portrait imprint went sour, leaving the one album Getting the Holy Ghost Across (US title: On a Blue Wing) with further tracks from that album's sessions issued on the UK mini-LP Living for the Spangled Moment. In the late 1980s, Nelson signed to Enigma Records who went out of business, although they had just re-released his entire Cocteau catalogue. As the decade ended, Nelson suffered a series of personal setbacks, including a divorce, tax problems and an acrimonious dispute with his manager over his back catalogue rights. In the case of one album, the unreleased Simplex, Nelson discovered his manager had been selling copies via mail order without Nelson's authorisation or knowledge; Nelson claimed he never received any royalties from these sales. =1990s= In 1992, Nelson released Blue Moons and Laughing Guitars on Virgin which consisted of demos for a proposed four guitarists, two drummers band which never materialised. \\"This is what I do behind locked doors,\\" he wrote on the sleeve, prefiguring much of his later, home recorded work including My Secret Studio (4-CD + 2-CD) and Noise Candy (6-CD). In the same year, Nelson worked with Roger Eno and Kate St. John as producer (with Roger Eno) on the duo's album The Familiar, on which Nelson also played guitar and other instruments. This experience fortuitously not only sowed the seeds of Eno's, Nelson's and St.John's participation in the 'ambient supergroup' Channel Light Vessel, which also featured Laraaji and Mayumi Tachibana, but also introduced Nelson to Voiceprint Records, whose subsidiary labels included All Saints and Resurgence, both of which would release a number of CLV and Nelson recordings over the next few years. In 1995, Nelson released two very different albums. Crimsworth (Flowers, Stones, Fountains And Flames) was an ambient piece which had provided the soundscape to an art installation. Practically Wired, or How I Became... Guitarboy! was a return to guitar-based instrumental music, something Nelson had barely touched for the previous decade and a half. In 1996, Nelson augmented his sound with drum and bass for After The Satellite Sings, credited as a major influence on David Bowie's Earthling album by Bowie's then guitarist Reeves Gabrels. By 1996, Nelson's troubles with his former manager were resolved in a lawsuit which enabled Nelson to recover much of his back catalogue. The fully authorised Simplex was subsequently released in 2001 by Lenin Imports and reissued in 2012 by Esoteric. In the late 1990s, Nelson created the Populuxe label, with a distribution arrangement via Robert Fripp's Discipline Global Mobile, but his relationship with them stagnated and Nelson's last release on that label was Atom Shop in 1998. Subsequent releases have been on other imprints such as Toneswoon as well as direct mail order (and later internet order) releases. =2000s= 2002 saw the release of EP Three White Roses & A Budd (with Fila Brazillia and Harold Budd) on Twentythree Records,. In 2001, Nelson attended a first Nelsonica convention, set up in West Yorkshire by fans in his honour, taking with him drawings to sell to any interested parties.Nelson, Bill diary of a hyperdreamer (2004) p.353 Bill Nelson's collected diaries from between 1999 and 2003, previously published on his official website Pomona It proved such a good experience that he resolved to contribute live music performances,Nelson, Bill diary of a hyperdreamer (2004) Pp. 386, 396, 406-7, Bill Nelson's collected diaries from between 1999 and 2003, previously published on his official website Pomona dedicated CDs of new material, and anything else that seemed appropriate,Nelson, Bill diary of a hyperdreamer (2004) Pp.429-31 Bill Nelson's collected diaries from between 1999 and 2003, previously published on his official website Pomona to any such future events. Nelsonica became an annual fixture in his calendar for the next decade or so. Attendees at 2002's Nelsonica 02 received a copy of Astral Motel, the first convention CD release. Honeytone Cody played one set, Nelson and his brother Ian played a second, while Nelson's newly assembled seven piece band The Lost Satellites,Nelson, Bill diary of a hyperdreamer (2004) Pp. 425-31 Bill Nelson's collected diaries from between 1999 and 2003, previously published on his official website Pomona which also included Ian, played a third.Nelson, Bill diary of a hyperdreamer (2004) Pp.453-463 Bill Nelson's collected diaries from between 1999 and 2003, previously published on his official website Pomona It was a resounding success and an annual institution was born. Three further albums followed in 2003: The Romance of Sustain Volume One: Painting With Guitars, Plaything, and a second Nelsonica CD Luxury Lodge,. Since then, Nelson has released an average of four albums a year, often in small runs which soon go out of print. He has accomplished this using his own series of branded record labels: Almost Opaque then Discs Of Ancient Odeon for the Nelsonica releases; Universal Twang then Sonoluxe for the others. (Nelson's Sonic Masonic imprint lasted for only one release, 2004's Satellite Songs) Nelson's in-house releasing was made possible by the financial backing of Sound on Sound magazine, whose website hosts his online shop and is named after Red Noise's Sound-on-Sound album. In 2004, the magazine also put up the money for Nelson to take his band Bill Nelson and the Lost Satellites on tour around the UK as The Be-Bop Deluxe And Beyond Tour. Nelson pursued different artistic directions. Two Rosewood releases contained acoustic guitar pieces \\"submitted to electronic and digital processing.\\" The highly personal The Alchemical Adventures Of Sailor Bill, was a concept album about the English coastline, ships and the sea, while its more ambient, instrumental companion piece Neptune's Galaxy comprised five long form instrumental compositions exploring the same subject. Of the former, Nelson wrote, \\"this set of songs comes (closer) to being personally fulfilling as almost any other album of mine.\\"Nelson, Bill diary of a hyperdreamer vol.2 (2015) p.116 Bill Nelson's collected diaries from between 2005 and 2006, previously published on his official website Pomona 978-190459-031-6 Most of the decade's remaining albums were lead electric guitar-oriented and non-vocal. Improvisation against pre- recorded backing tracks played a major role in And We Fell Into A Dream while the very different Theatre Of Falling Leaves eschewed lead guitar in favour of keyboards. The decade closed with more voice-based material as Nelson crooned through Golden Melodies Of Tomorrow, delivered more familiar rock and ballad vocals on Fancy Planets and delved into romantic songwriting in The Dream Transmission Pavilion. In the first half of the decade, Nelson published his collected online diaries from 1999-2003 under the moniker diary of a hyperdreamer. A second volume covering entries from 2005-2006 would appear in 2015. The last ten years of this diary remain on his official website to this day. He also gave extensive interviews to biographer Paul Sutton Reeves for a book, the publication of which was put on hold for around two years when publisher Sean Body died. Music In Dreamland Bill Nelson & Be-Bop Deluxe, finally materialised in 2008. In the second half of the decade, Nelson's live performances (mostly at the Nelsonica events) broadened out from solo work to encompass two other bands. One was the improvisational, three-piece Orchestra Futura consisting of Nelson, Dave Sturt (bass) and Theo Travis (assorted woodwind, brass). (The duo of Sturt and Travis already played together as Cipher.) The other was the more conventional rock oriented, seven-piece Bill Nelson and the Gentlemen Rocketeers (again including Sturt and Travis) which played songs with vocals from the extensive Nelson/Be-Bop Deluxe back catalogue. By 2006, Universal Music (UK) had re-issued three Mercury albums: Quit Dreaming and Get on the Beam, The Love that Whirls and Chimera had all been remastered and released with bonus tracks. Sonoluxe had reissued the CBS album Getting the Holy Ghost Across / On a Blue Wing with all the original tracks including those from Living for the Spangled Moment. =2010s= In 2010, Nelson published the first part of an autobiography. In March 2011, motivated by a desire to capture the flavour of recent gigs on film for posterity via DVD release, Bill Nelson and the Gentlemen Rocketeers played a concert of songs spanning Nelson's career before a live audience in front of in-house cameras at Metropolis Studios, London. Dissatisfied with the resultant sound mix, Nelson remixed it himself at his own expense. Using Nelson's remix, ITV Studios Home Entertainment released a DVD of the event. This initial release quickly sold out. A promised television broadcast of the recording only materialised in a few selected territories, excluding the UK. The video and audio recording has subsequently been reissued on other formats including CD and LP. However, having signed away his rights to these recordings, Nelson has made no money on these releases. In 2011, Cherry Red Records' subsidiary Esoteric Recordings commenced a roll-out re-release of Nelson's back catalogue for many of his releases between 1981 and 2002 with the 8-CD compilation The Practice of Everyday Life which covered 40 years of recordings. Other notable reissues have included the 4-CD The Book Of Splendours and the 6-CD Noise Candy,. The Esoteric deal did not involve a rights buyout, so Nelson is properly compensated for these reissues. In 2013, Nelson finally began releasing his out of print CD back catalogue from 2002 onwards as digital downloads via Bandcamp. On this platform he subsequently released the three volume compilation The Dreamer's Companion in 2014 and brand new albums commencing with Special Metal from 2016 onwards. In addition to his numerous solo releases of recent years, Nelson has also made both film soundtracks and a number of collaborative recordings with other artists. In 2010, he released the soundtrack to the US TV documentary American Stamps as Picture Post while in 2014, he released the soundtrack to UK director Daisy Asquith's paean to cycling Velorama (a tie in with the 2014 Tour de France cycle race which went through Yorkshire) as Pedalscope. In 2012, Nelson finally completed The Last of the Neon Cynics, a long standing project with comic artist Matt Howarth: the latter supplied a comic (a PDF file) while the former provided a soundtrack to it. In 2014, he collaborated with fellow guitarist Reeves Gabrels (who has also worked with David Bowie and The Cure) on Fantastic Guitars. In 2014, Nelson suffered a complete hearing loss in his right ear. This put a stop to any plans for playing live (and by extension Nelsonica events built around live performance) for the foreseeable future. Yet he continued to record and release music despite this disability. The first album to be affected was Quiet Bells. According to Nelson's sleeve notes, \\"to slowly adjust to this problem, I decided to make an album that features mainly guitar, a gentle collection of instrumentals in a neo- minimalist, ambient style.\\" In 2014, Nelson was honoured by Wakefield Council with a Hollywood-style star on the city‚Äôs walk of fame. He also designed an extremely limited edition 'Astroluxe Custom Ltd' guitar for the Eastwood company. In 2016, 46 years after recording his debut album, Nelson released a sequel entitled New Northern Dream.

He briefly served as the country's first prime minister in 1918 and continued serving as the minister of foreign affairs until 1920, representing the fledgling Lithuanian state at the Versailles Peace Conference and the League of Nations. After some time in academia, Voldemaras returned to politics in 1926, when he was elected to the Third Seimas. Dissatisfied with the left-wing government of President Kazys Grinius, Voldemaras and fellow nationalist Antanas Smetona supported the military coup d'√©tat in December 1926 and he was appointed as the prime minister for a second time. A brilliant orator, Voldemaras represented the radical wing of the Lithuanian Nationalist Union that was increasingly critical of the more moderate policies of President Smetona. Smetona had Voldemaras removed from office in September 1929 and exiled to Zarasai. Voldemaras was arrested in 1934 after a failed coup against Smetona and served a prison sentence until exiled to France in 1938. Returning to Lithuania soon after the Soviet occupation of Lithuania, he was promptly arrested by the Soviet authorities and died in their custody in Moscow. Early life and education Dysna Voldemaras was born on 16 April 1883 in Dysna village in what is now Ignalina district municipality, Lithuania (then part of the Vilna Governorate of the Russian Empire). Though born to a family of modest means and education, Augustinas excelled at his studies. He finished the public school in nearby Tvereƒçius and graduated from a three-year school in ≈†venƒçionys. In 1890 he moved to Saint Petersburg to join his brother who had been working there. In 1902, Voldemaras passed the exams to enter a gymnasium, eventually graduating with distinction in 1904. While preparing for the exams in 1901, Voldemaras met Antanas Smetona who would become his close friend, political collaborator and, eventually, his political nemesis. In 1909, Voldemaras graduated in History and Philosophy at the Saint Petersburg Imperial University and, in 1910, received his Master's Degree and was awarded a gold medal for his dissertation. A scholarship fund was set up to enable him to further his studies, and eventually he achieved his PhD. After a period of studying in Italy and Sweden, Voldemaras returned to the university (now named Petrograd Imperial University) in 1915 and joined its staff. He moved to Perm to become a professor when the Imperial University opened its branch there (the branch would later become Perm State University). However, Voldemaras was not satisfied with the living conditions in Perm and planned his return to Lithuania. Political career =Entry into politics= Voldemaras first entered politics as a student in Saint Petersburg. The wave of nationalism sweeping Lithuania did not elude him and the many other Lithuanians in the Russian Empire ‚Äî prominent voices started calling for Lithuanian independence or autonomy within the Empire. Voldemaras joined the activities of the newly established Party of National Progress in 1916 and joined one of the Lithuanian student groups in Saint Petersburg, representing it at the Petrograd Seimas in June 1917 and the Congress of Non-Sovereign Nations in Kiev in September 1917. In 1918, he represented the Lithuanian interests at the peace negotiations for the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk between Germany and the Soviet Russia. Since Lithuania was not part of the negotiations, he was officially part of the delegation of the short-lived Ukrainian People's Republic. His influence at the conference was minimal and Lithuania was claimed by Germany as part of the settlement. The Council of Lithuania in 1918. Augustinas Voldemaras is standing on the far right In 1918, Voldemaras finally returned to Lithuania and was invited to join the Council of Lithuania after several members had left the council in protest of its alignment with Germany. One of the many problems facing the council was the lack of unity among Lithuanian organizations ‚Äî several were claiming to represent Lithuania on the international stage. In September 1918, Voldemaras, together with Smetona, participated in a conference in Lausanne, Switzerland, helping to unite the organizations behind the Council of Lithuania. Events moved rapidly after the defeat of Germany in the World War I, with Germany recognizing the Lithuanian independence and its army withdrawing. The Presidium of the Council of Lithuania, which had been acting as a collective head of state, chose Voldemaras as the first Prime Minister of Lithuania and allowed him to form the government. =On the Government of Lithuania= Voldemaras assumed power on 11 November 1918 and started forming the cabinet, taking two cabinet positions for himself: the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Defense. Voldemaras's first stated priority was to ensure the internal stability of the country, hoping that a statement of neutrality would be enough to deter foreign interference for a time. Nevertheless, On 23 November he signed the order creating the Lithuanian armed forces and appointed General Kyprian Kandratovich as the Deputy Minister of Defense‚Äîthis appointment proved to be very unpopular. Kondratovich, who was an ethnic Russian and was viewed with suspicion by many, failed to take measures to organize the defense of the country and proposed to move the government to Grodno when Vilnius was threatened by Soviet advance. He was dismissed on 24 December 1918. Voldemaras, together with President Smetona, left Lithuania on 21 December 1918. The stated purpose of the trip was to secure a badly needed loan from Germany and to participate in the Versailles Peace Conference, but the departure generated outrage in Lithuania where Voldemaras was seen as fleeing the Soviet advance. In absentia, he was replaced as the Prime Minister on 26 December 1918 by Mykolas Sle≈æeviƒçius. Furious with the events, Voldemaras nevertheless continued working as the Minister of Foreign affairs and stayed in Versailles representing Lithuania. The Lithuanian representatives in Versailles focused on receiving recognition of the independent Lithuania and its borders, as well as securing support in the struggle against Bolsheviks. Voldemaras and his colleagues found little support for their goals among the great powers: those supporting a strong Russia saw Lithuania as an integral part of that state, while the proponents of Poland as a bulwark against bolshevism thought Lithuanian independence would weaken it. Voldemaras similarly found it difficult to secure recognition for Lithuania after the end of the conference, with the United States refusing recognition in November 1919 (granting it only in 1922) and Soviet Russia refusing peace negotiations at the beginning of 1920. In June 1920, Voldemaras resigned together with the rest of the cabinet to make way for the government formed on the basis of the elections to the constituent assembly. Voldemaras did not take part in the assembly, instead returning to academia. =Coup d'√©tat and ascent to power= Even when working in academia, Voldemaras continued publishing political articles and essays, often critical of the government. In 1923, his political writings earned him a punishment of one month of forced labor in Varniai. In 1926, Voldemaras was elected to the Seimas and was particularly critical of the President Kazys Grinius and his government that came to power after the elections of 1926. He saw Grinius as too lenient on minority rights and advocated for a stronger, more dictatorial government in the mold of fascist regimes that were gaining power in much of Europe at the time. In 1926, a segment of the army that disagreed with the policies of Grinius administration planned a military coup d'√©tat. They appealed to Voldemaras and Antanas Smetona, now the leaders of the Lithuanian Nationalist Union, to support them, both of whom agreed. The coup took place on 17 December, deposing Grinius and installing Smetona as the president for a second time and Voldemaras as the prime minister. To assuage public opinion, in both Lithuania and the outside world, Grinius agreed to appoint Voldemaras as the Prime Minister, on a condition that the latter would uphold the constitution of 1922. Although Voldemaras made this commitment, he and Smetona would renege on it within a year when the Third Seimas was dissolved and no new elections were called. Voldemaras joked at the time that he had promised to hold elections, but made no promises on the year they would be held in. The move prompted the Christian Democrats to leave the government, leaving the Nationalist Union as the sole governing party. Finally, in 1928, the constitution of 1922 was scrapped altogether and replaced by a new constitution without following the constitutional procedures and without any sort of approval from the voters or the legislature. Augustinas Voldemaras (sitting on the left) and Gustav Stresemann in Berlin (1928)Voldemaras again assumed the role of the minister of foreign affairs together with that of prime minister, seeing foreign relations as the key issue for the government. In January 1928, Voldemaras signed a border treaty with Germany, in which Germany accepted the Lithuanian possession of Klaipƒóda (Memel). A trade agreement was also signed with the United Kingdom in the same year. 1926-27 saw the establishment of Gele≈æinis Vilkas (Iron Wolf) organization among right-wing army officers and students. Ostensibly a youth sport organization and registered as such in 1928, Iron Wolf was heavily nationalistic and had a stated purpose of combating the enemies of the state. Their ideology and practices (initiates would kiss an iron dagger as part of their initiation ceremony) were outside the comfort zone of many among the populace and the political elite. Although Smetona was the honorary head of the organization, it was Voldemaras who actively participated in managing it. His personality and oratory skills attracted adherents among the younger nationalist officers, who were favorably impressed by the emerging fascism, and who were displeased with what they perceived as Smetona's more moderate course. On the other hand, Voldemaras was unpopular with foreign representatives in Lithuania, who perceived him as too radical and arrogant. =Assassination attempt and fall from power= The activities of Gele≈æinis Vilkas and Voldemaras's more radical stance created friction between him and Smetona. As early as the beginning of 1929, Smetona was preparing to oust Voldemaras from the government. These initial plans were revised by an attempt on Voldemaras's life in May. On 6 May 1929, as Voldemaras, his wife and their friends were approaching a theater in Kaunas, they were shot on from behind. At least seven shots were fired, killing Voldemaras's adjutant and injuring several others. Voldemaras and his wife escaped unharmed, but his nephew was seriously hurt. Three Lithuanian students, members of Au≈°rininkai, were accused of involvement in the assassination attempt, with one of them sentenced and executed. The outpouring of public and international support made it impossible for Smetona to dismiss Voldemaras, but pushed the latter to get even more involved with Gele≈æinis Vilkas. On 19 September 1929, while attending a meeting of the League of Nations, Voldemaras was ousted by President Smetona after the cabinet resigned. Smetona installed his brother-in-law Juozas T≈´belis as the Prime Minister. In 1930, he was exiled to Plateliai and later to Zarasai, where he lived under police surveillance. It was from Zarasai that he was flown into Kaunas during an attempted coup against Smetona in 1934. Several officers sympathetic to Voldemaras and associated with Gele≈æinis Vilkas attempted to replace Smetona, but the coup did not have widespread support in the military and was unsuccessful. Voldemaras was imprisoned for the next four years, receiving amnesty on the condition he would leave the country. He chose France as his destination. Later life and death Voldemaras attempted to return to Lithuania in 1939, but was exiled again. In June 1940, days after the Soviet Union invaded and occupied Lithuania, Voldemaras and his wife made another attempt to return from exile. He was arrested at the border and imprisoned. It later emerged that he died while in Moscow Butyrka prison on 16 December 1942. His place of burial is unknown; a memorial stone for him was unveiled in the Petra≈°i≈´nai cemetery in Kaunas in 2012. Other activities and personal life Augistinas Voldemaras and Matilda Voldemarienƒó in Berlin in 1928 While in Perm, Voldemaras taught Roman history, Greek, Latin and English at what would become Perm State University. After his stint on the government, he returned to academia in 1920, teaching courses and eventually joining the University of Lithuania (now Vytautas Magnus University) in Kaunas. At the university, he served as a professor and the dean of sociological studies. His academic works were highly acclaimed and in 1923-1924 he participated in international scientific congresses on History and Sociology. A polyglot, Voldemaras was familiar with sixteen different languages and wrote academic works in Lithuanian and French. In 1919, Voldemaras met Matilda Voldemarienƒó (n√©e Delahay). While Voldemaras always introduced her as his wife, the status of their relationship was not completely clear and generated some amount of controversy in Lithuania, particularly when the couple visited the Vatican in 1927. Voldemaras's political opponents, the Christian Democrats, alleged in Lithuanian press that the couple were living together outside marriage, but the issue was not pressed by the Holy See and the couple received blessings from the Pope. In 1929, the couple acted as the godparents to the three-year- old Valdas Adamkus, who would later become the President of Lithuania. Nevertheless, Voldemaras was considered a womanizer and was known to have had several high-profile affairs during the years.

Early life Reynolds made his first game sale with Quest 1 to SoftSide magazine, its August 1981 cover feature. He was a gamer in high school, and a SysOp on Randolph School's (Huntsville, Alabama) PDP-11 mainframe computer.Walden, Lea Ann, et al. (Spring 2013). \\"Where Are They Now?\\". Randolph Magazine 18 (1). pp. 20-27. Retrieved August 26, 2014. A 1990 graduate of the University of the South, Reynolds briefly pursued graduate studies in Philosophy at the University of California, Berkeley. Career Reynolds initiated his game career with MicroProse where he worked as lead programmer for a number of graphic adventure games. These included Rex Nebular in 1992 and Return of the Phantom and Dragonsphere in 1993. It was at MicroProse where Reynolds first worked with Sid Meier and the two collaborated on a strategy title by the name of Sid Meier's Colonization which was released in 1994. Reynolds went on to become lead designer for a sequel to Sid Meier's Civilization. Civilization II was released in 1996 and sold multi-million copies. While at Firaxis, Reynolds contributed to Sid Meier's Gettysburg in 1997, followed by the creation and design of Sid Meier's Alpha Centauri in 1998. Alpha Centauri became his second multi-million selling title. In 2000 Reynolds left Firaxis games and sold his share in the company to become CEO of Big Huge Games. On June 30, 2009, Zynga announced that Brian Reynolds was leaving Big Huge Games to lead the formation of Zynga East, and serve the role of Chief Game Designer. In February 2013, Reynolds left Zynga. In March, he revived Big Huge Games (temporarily known as SecretNewCo). In July, the team announced their partnership with Nexon, a South Korean game developer, to develop their first game, DomiNations, a mobile game similar to Civilization or Age of Empires. Big Huge Games was acquired by Nexon in 2016. Contributions Although marketed under Sid Meier's name, Civilization II, Sid Meier's Colonization and Sid Meier's Alpha Centauri all credited Reynolds as lead designer. The credits for Civilization II only list Meier as the designer of the original Civilization game, and Reynolds stated in an interview that for this game Meier \\"was no longer involved except in name.\\" The credits for Alpha Centauri state that the game was \\"Created by\\" Brian Reynolds and Meier is listed with several other team members on the \\"With\\" line - in the Designers Notes in the game manual Reynolds also thanks him for all his sage advice. Brian Reynolds' first major break was the design of Sid Meier's Civilization II. Meier had created Civilization but had moved on to other projects. MicroProse wanted to make a sequel and asked Reynolds to design it. MicroProse put Meier on retainer for consultational advice and for the use of his name, but Meier only had peripheral involvement in the design of this game. The sequel game, hence, was primarily designed by Reynolds. Rise of Nations was Reynolds' first game at Big Huge Games. Later came Rise of Legends, a real-time strategy game, published by Microsoft. Reynolds and Klaus Teuber collaborated to develop the Xbox Live Arcade game Catan. Reynolds led the development of FrontierVille and CityVille 2 for Facebook.

It is one of India's largest electronic/IT industrial parks, spread over 800 acres (3.2 km¬≤) in Konappana Agrahara and Doddathogur villages in Bangalore. Electronic City was established by KEONICS (Karnataka State Electronics Development Corporation), and consists of four zones called phases - Phase I, Phase II, Phase III and Phase IV. There are approximately 200 IT/ITES company campuses located in Electronic City, including main campuses of Infosys, Wipro, TCS, HCL, Tech Mahindra and Biocon. History Electronic City was the brainchild of R. K. Baliga, the first Chairman and Managing Director of Keonics, Karnataka Electronic. He dreamt of making Bangalore the Silicon Valley of India when he developed the concept of Electronic City. In 1978, Keonics established Electronic City on 332 acres of land in Konappana Agrahara and Doddathogur villages. The liberalisation of the Indian economy in the early 1990s by the then Indian Prime Minister P.V. Narasimha Rao and then Indian Finance Minister Dr. Manmohan Singh helped Electronic City to become what it is today ‚Äî the outsourcing capital of the world. In 1997, the maintenance and upkeep of Electronic City was handed over by Keonics to ELCIA, the Electronic City Industries Association, with representatives from units in the enclave, for effective local governance and management. Security is provided by ELCIA, who have deployed around 500 security officials and also installed CCTV cameras on strategic locations. On 18 March 2013, a notification by the Urban Development Department has brought Electronic City Phases I, II, III under the E-City Industrial Township Area. There are many famous educational institutes situated in Electronic City, IIIT Bangalore, Symbiosis Institute of Business Management, Bengaluru, Welingkar Institute Of Management Bangalore, Xavier Institute of Management and Entrepreneurship, IFIM are some of them. Connectivity and transport Electronic City has well developed infrastructure in terms of connectivity to other important localities of Bangalore city. =Road=  Hosur Road  Electronic City is on Hosur Road which is a major arterial highway of Bangalore city. Many BMTC buses and interstate buses ply.  Elevated Expressway  The four- lane mixed corridor elevated highway from Silk Board junction to Electronic City was opened on 22 January 2010. The 9.985 km long expressway is one of the longest elevated national highways in the country. This elevated stretch, helps a commuter reach Electronic City from Silk Board in less than 15 minutes. NICE Road The NICE road connects Electronic City to other key areas in the west of Bengaluru city like, Bannergatta Road, Mysore Road, Kanakapura Road and Tumkur Road. This is a 63 km 6-lane access controlled tollway. =Rail=  Metro  Electronic City comes under the Namma Metro Yellow Line (R V Road - Bommasandra line). The project is expected to complete in the year 2022.  Suburban rail  The Heelalige railway station, about 4 km from Electronic City Phase 2, has become part of the Bengaluru Suburban Rail (Bengaluru Commuter Rail) system. The South-Western Railways has introduced a fleet of Diesel Multiple Units (DMUs) on this route. =Air= Kempegowda International Airport is located 54 km away from Electronic City. The proposed Hosur Airport in Belagondapalli on Thally Road, an UDAN project, will be 28 km away from Electronic City. The helicopter taxi service to Kempegowda International Airport was launched in March 2018.

A large sleep debt may lead to mental or physical fatigue. There are two kinds of sleep debt: the results of partial sleep deprivation and total sleep deprivation. Partial sleep deprivation occurs when a person or a lab animal sleeps too little for several days or weeks. Total sleep deprivation means being kept awake for at least 24 hours. There is debate in the scientific community over the specifics of sleep debt, and it is not considered to be a disorder. Phosphorylation of proteins In mice there are 80 proteins in the brain, called \\"sleep need index phosphoproteins\\" (SNIPPs), which become more and more phosphorylated during waking hours, and are dephosphorylated during sleep. The phosphorylation is aided by the gene Sik3. A type of Laboratory mouse called Sleepy with an altered version of this protein (called SLEEPY) which is more active than the regular version, resulting in the mice showing more slow-wave activity during non-REM sleep, which is the best measurable index of sleep need known. Inhibition of the Sik3 gene decreases phosphorylation and slow- wave activity in both normal and modified mice.  Physiological effects of sleep debt  Chronic sleep debt has a substantial health impact on the human body, specifically on metabolic and endocrine functions. A study published in The Lancet investigated the physiological effects of sleep debt by assessing the sympathovagal balance (an indicator of the sympathetic nervous system activity), thyrotropic function, HPA axis activity as well as the carbohydrate metabolism of 11 young adult males whose sleep period for six nights was either restricted to four hours per night or extended to 12 hours in bed per night. Results revealed that in the sleep-debt condition, thyrotropin concentrations were decreased while lowered glucose and insulin responses indicated a clear impairment of carbohydrate tolerance, a 30% decrease than in the well-rested sleep condition. On the other hand, males who were sleep- restricted showed significantly elevated concentrations of evening cortisol (the \\"stress\\" hormone) and elevated sympathetic nervous system activity in comparison to those who enjoyed a full sleep, over a period of 6 nights. Chronic sleep debt has a detrimental impact on human (neuro)physiological functioning and can disrupt immune, endocrine and metabolic function while increasing the severity of cardiovascular and age-related illnesses over a period of time.  Neuropsychological effects of sleep debt on emotions  Accumulated and continuous short-term sleep deficit has been shown to increase and intensify psychophsyiological reactions in humans to emotional stimuli. The amygdala plays a strong functional role in the expression of negative emotions such as fear, and through its anatomical connections with the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) has an important function in subjective suppression of and the reframing and reappraisal of negative emotions. A study assessing sleep deficit in young Japanese men over a 5-day period during which they slept only 4 hours per day showed that there was greater left amygdala activation to fearful faces but not happy faces, and an overall subjective mood deterioration. As a result, even short-term continuous sleep debt, or deprivation, has been shown to reduce this functional relationship between the amygdala and mPFC, inducing negative mood changes through increased fear and anxiety to unpleasant emotional stimuli and events. Thus, a full and uninterrupted 7-hour sleep is crucial for the proper functioning of the amygdala in modulating an individual's mood states by reducing negative emotional intensities and increasing reactivity to positive emotional stimuli.  Sleep debt and obesity  Epidemiological research has solidified the association between sleep debt and/or deprivation and obesity as a result of an elevated body mass index (BMI) through various ways such as disruptions in the hormones leptin and ghrelin that regulate appetite, higher food consumption and poor diets, and a decrease in overall calorie burning. However, in recent years, multimedia usage such as internet and television consumption that play an active role in sleep deficit has also been linked to obesity by provoking unhealthy sedentary lifestyles and habits as well as higher food consumption. Moreover, work-related behaviors such as long working and commuting hours and irregular work timings such as during shift work also functions as a contributing factor to overweight and obesity as a result of shorter sleeping periods. In comparison to adults, children exhibit a more consistent association between sleep debt and obesity.  Sleep debt and mortality  Several studies have shown that sleep duration, specifically sleep deficit or shorter sleep duration, has an effect on mortality, whether it be weekdays or weekends. In people aged 65 years and younger, a daily sleep duration of 5 hours or less (amounting to a sleep deficit of 2 hours per day) during weekends correlated with a 52% higher mortality rate compared to a control group who slept for 7 hours. Consistent weekday sleep debt exhibited a detrimental association with mortality and morbidity, but this effect was negated when compensated with long sleep during weekends. However, the harmful consequences of sleep debt over weekdays and weekends was not seen in individuals aged 65 years and older. Scientific debate There is debate among researchers as to whether the concept of sleep debt describes a measurable phenomenon. The September 2004 issue of the journal Sleep contains dueling editorials from two leading sleep researchers, David F. Dinges and Jim Horne. A 1997 experiment conducted by psychiatrists at the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine suggested that cumulative nocturnal sleep debt affects daytime sleepiness, particularly on the first, second, sixth, and seventh days of sleep restriction. In one study, subjects were tested using the psychomotor vigilance task (PVT). Different groups of people were tested with different sleep times for two weeks: 8 hours, 6 hours, 4 hours, and total sleep deprivation. Each day they were tested for the number of lapses on the PVT. The results showed that as time went by, each group's performance worsened, with no sign of any stopping point. Moderate sleep deprivation was found to be detrimental; people who slept 6 hours a night for 10 days had similar results to those who were completely sleep deprived for 1 day.Walker, M.P. (2009, October 21). *Sleep Deprivation III: Brain consequences ‚Äì Attention, concentration and real life.* Lecture given in Psychology 133 at the University of California, Berkeley, CA. Evaluation Sleep debt has been tested in a number of studies through the use of a sleep onset latency test. This test attempts to measure how easily a person can fall asleep. When this test is done several times during a day, it is called a multiple sleep latency test (MSLT). The subject is told to go to sleep and is awakened after determining the amount of time it took to fall asleep. The Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS), an eight item questionnaire with scores ranging from 0 to 24, is another tool used to screen for potential sleep debt. A January 2007 study from Washington University in St. Louis suggests that saliva tests of the enzyme amylase could be used to indicate sleep debt, as the enzyme increases its activity in correlation with the length of time a subject has been deprived of sleep. The control of wakefulness has been found to be strongly influenced by the protein orexin. A 2009 study from Washington University in St. Louis has illuminated important connections between sleep debt, orexin, and amyloid beta, with the suggestion that the development of Alzheimer's disease could hypothetically be a result of chronic sleep debt or excessive periods of wakefulness.

Early life He was born in the townland of Mallabraca near the town of Dunmanway in West Cork on 1877 and was a member of the Church of Ireland. He was the son of farmer John Maguire and the former Jane Kingston. He had four brothers and two sisters. Willie was the eldest then Mary, Jack, Dick, Paul (who married a Roman Catholic and whose son became a Roman Catholic priest), Sam and Elizabeth. The Maguires farmed of land. However this figure is misleading as only approximately 80 acres were arable land. The translation of the townland Mallabraca is \\"land of the little hillocks\\", Today, 2016, most of the land is devoted to forestry. In Ireland, forestry is usually planted on less fertile land. He went to school in the Model School in the local town Dunmanway and then to the national school in Ardfield. This school run by Master Madden specialised in preparing its pupils for the UK Civil Service and Post Office examinations. Madden was part of a long tradition of Irish nationalism and he had a field next to the school where pupils could play Gaelic football. The school was very successful and became known as the \\"University of the Mountains\\" because the place name Ardfield can be literally translated as the \\"place on the high ground\\". At the age of 20, Maguire passed the exams for the UK Post Office. Professional life He then took a job in the British Civil Service in London. Maguire joined and captained the successful London Hibernians Gaelic football team to several All-Ireland finals between 1900 and 1904. In 1907 he went into the administration of the London GAA, becoming the Chairman of the London County Board and a regular delegate to the Annual Congress of the GAA. He later became a trustee of Croke Park. Coincidentally, Vice-Chairman of the London County Board was Liam MacCarthy who gave his name to the All-Ireland Senior Hurling Championship Cup. He is also remembered in the political sphere for recruiting the nationalist leader Michael Collins to the Irish Republican Brotherhood in 1909 and for many years was one of Collins right hand men. As Collins's chief intelligence officer in London, Maguire became the centre of Scotland Yard's investigation into the assassination of Sir Henry Wilson. Maguire was tipped off and fled to Dublin in December 1923Mike Cronin, 'Maguire, Samuel [Sam] (1877‚Äì1927)', Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, Oct 2005; online edn, May 2006 where he got a job in the newly established Irish civil service. Because of his political opinions and his sympathies to the Anti-Treaty forces, he quickly clashed with his superiors and was dismissed. Death Cork-based Margaret Walsh, who has written Sam Maguire: The Enigmatic Man Behind Ireland's Most Prestigious Trophy, says that \\"what became of him was very sad\\". \\"In 1924, he was sacked and deprived of his pension.\\" They (the Irish Government) gave him ¬£100 and that was it. \\"In 1925, he came back to west Cork to live. He then developed TB and died in penury in 1927 aged 49. They say that he died of a broken heart and penniless,\\" she says. He is buried in the cemetery of Saint Mary's in Dunmanway. A Celtic cross was raised over his grave with a simple inscription > Erected to the memory of Samuel Maguire, Mallabraca who died 6th February > 1927 by the people of Dunmanway and his numerous friends throughout Ireland > and England in recognition of his love for his country. Dunmanway's Dohenys GAA club named their home pitch Sam Maguire Park in his honour, and the club's under-age teams joined with the Randal Og Club compete under the moniker \\"Sam Maguires\\". On 15 September 2002, a statue of Sam Maguire was unveiled as the centrepiece of a new ‚Ç¨500,000 plaza in Dunmanway's town centre. In 2017, the community of Dunmanway paid for a new set of eight bells (the 'Sam Maguire Community bells') which are installed in St. Mary's Church. The two lightest bells were cast in 2017 and have 'Sam Maguire 1877-1927' inscribed on them, while the back six bells were cast in 1887 by John Warner, and were formerly hung in the now-closed Christ Church, Llanelli, Wales.http://dove.cccbr.org.uk/detail.php?numPerPage=10&searchCountry;=Ireland&searchPracN;=n%2Fk&searchAmount;=%3D&searchMetric;=cwt&Submit;=Go&sortBy;=Place&sortDir;=Asc&DoveID;=DUNMANWAY Sam Maguire Cup The Sam Maguire Cup was designed and presented to the Gaelic Athletic Association in 1928 in his honour after his death in 1927. The cup cost ¬£300 in 1928 (equivalent to ‚Ç¨26,395 now). After it had been commissioned by the committee under the chairmanship of Dr Pat McCartan, the task of making the cup was given to Hopkins and Hopkins, a jewellers and watchmakers, of O'Connell Bridge, Dublin.

His mother was Sherry Bernstein (born Shirley Jacqueline Kegel, February 2, 1921 to October 27, 2018) and his father was Herman Bernstein (1901‚Äì1977). Charles then matriculated at Harvard College, where he majored in philosophy and studied the work of J.L. Austin and Ludwig Wittgenstein under Stanley Cavell, a seminal figure in ordinary language philosophy, as well as Rogers Albritton.http://writing.upenn.edu/library/Bernstein-Charles-and-Loss-Pequeno- Glazier_Autobiographical-Interview_1996.pdf Cavell would oversee Bernstein's thesis, a study that pursued the aesthetic and poetic possibilities of the amalgamation of analytical philosophy and avant-garde literature, focussing on Gertrude Stein and Wittgenstein. After graduating from Harvard in 1972, his first book, Asylums, was published in 1975. Together with Bruce Andrews he edited the magazine L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E, which ran to 13 issues (3 volumes) between 1978 and 1981 (plus 3 supplements and a fourth volume in 1981. This is routinely considered to be the starting point of Language Poetry and was the most significant outlet for both the progressive poetry and progressive poetic theory taking place in New York City and Berkeley. He has said about the creation of L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E, \\"We tried to trace a history of radical poetics, taking up the model presented in Jerome Rothenberg's Revolution of the Word, and later by Rothenberg and Pierre Joris in Poems for the Millennium and Marjorie Perloff in The Futurist Moment.

Hill played nine seasons in the National Football League (NFL) with the Chicago Bears, Pittsburgh Steelers, and Detroit Lions. He was the NFL Rookie of the Year in 1954 and winner of the Jim Thorpe Trophy as the NFL Player of the Year in 1955. The Harlon Hill Trophy, named in his honor, is awarded annually to the nation's best NCAA Division II football player. Early life and college Hill was born in Killen, Alabama. Following graduation from Lauderdale County High School in nearby Rogersville in 1949, he attended Florence State Teachers College, now known as the University of North Alabama. Football was just making its return to Florence State in 1949 after several years absence due to low male enrollment, and Hill was a four- year letterman on the team while also earning a Bachelor of Science degree in Education. He played both offense and defense for the team, but it was his offensive efforts that saw him named an NAIA All-American player in his senior year, 1953. As with many college teams of the era, Florence State was a run- based offense and threw the ball sparingly. However, Hill made the most of his chances with 19 of his 54 career catches going for touchdowns. In his 1977 biography Victory after the Game, Hill related his surprise at being selected in the 15th round of the 1954 NFL draft by the Chicago Bears, remaining unaware of it until approached with the news by a Florence State professor on campus: '\\"I had no idea I had been \`discovered.' I really did not know much about the National Football League...I did not know what to think, but after I found out what it was all about, naturally I was elated.\\" Hill went on to say he owed the discovery to a rival school. A coach for Jacksonville State University had observed Hill's play over four seasons and mentioned him to a Bears scout. Professional career Hill's rookie season with the Chicago Bears was a memorable one. He set a team record for most receiving yards (1,124) and most touchdown receptions (12) by a rookie. The twelve touchdowns led all NFL receivers that season as he averaged 25 yards per catch on 45 total receptions His best performance that rookie year came on October 31, 1954 against the San Francisco 49ers. Hill was a Halloween nightmare for the 49ers defense, racking up 214 receiving yards and four touchdowns, the final one coming with thirty seconds left in the game to give the Bears a four-point victory. Numerous accolades came Hill's way following that season, among them being named 1954 NFL Rookie of the Year, being an All-Pro selection, and participating in the 1954 Pro Bowl. Hill's performance numbers were down somewhat the next season, 1955, with 789 yards on 42 receptions. However his nine touchdown catches again led the league and he was once again selected All-Pro and Pro-Bowl participant. The 1955 season also saw Hill be the first ever recipient of the Jim Thorpe Trophy as NFL most valuable player. 1956 would prove to be Hill's career best statistically with 47 catches, 1,128 receiving yards and 11 touchdowns as the Bears advanced to the NFL Championship Game against the New York Giants. Hill and the Bears were beaten soundly, 47-7, on a very icy Yankee Stadium field. After the season Hill was voted an All-NFL 1st team player by numerous media including the Associated Press, United Press, and the Sporting News. He was chosen Captain of the Western Conference squad for the 1956 Pro Bowl game, which lost in a close affair, 31-30. Injuries began to take their toll on Hill's NFL career in the late 1950s. The most serious one being a completely severed Achilles tendon in 1958. According to Hill he was the first professional athlete to recover from the surgical repair and continue his career. The injury robbed him of much of his speed however and his offensive numbers steadily declined, with his last touchdown reception coming in the 1959 season. By 1961, his final year as a Bear, he managed only three catches for 51 yards on the season. Hill attempted to play again in the 1962 season, splitting time between the Steelers and Lions and accumulating 101 receiving yards on 14 catches. He retired from football at the conclusion of the 1962 season. Hill still holds several franchise records with the Bears and ranks among the best in others. His nineteen games with 100 or more receiving yards are still a record as are his 1,124 rookie receiving yards and 12 rookie touchdown catches. The four touchdown receptions in one game (San Francisco, 1954) are tied with Mike Ditka for team lead all-time. His career 4,616 receiving yards and 40 career touchdown receptions (32 of them coming in a 3 year span from 1954 through 1956) rank him second best all-time for Chicago. The Professional Football Researchers Association named Hill to the PRFA Hall of Very Good Class of 2014 = Franchise records = 's NFL off-season, Harlon Hill held at least 15 Bears franchise records, including: * Most Receiving Yds (rookie season): 1,124 (1954) * Most Receiving Yds (game, as a rookie): 214 (1954-10-31 @SFO) * Most Yds/Rec (career): 20.42 * Most Yds/Rec (season): 24.98 (1954) * Most Yds/Rec (rookie season): 24.98 (1954) * Most Receiving TDs (career): 40 * Most Receiving TDs (game): 4 (1954-10-31 @SFO) * Most Receiving TDs (rookie season): 12 (1954; tied with Mike Ditka) * Most Receiving TDs (game, as a rookie): 4 (1954-10-31 @SFO) * Most Rec Yds/Game (rookie season): 93.7 (1954) * Most Yds from Scrimmage (game, as a rookie): 214 (1954-10-31 @SFO) * Most 100+ yard receiving games (career): 19 * Most 100+ yard receiving games (season): 7 (1954; tied with Jeff Graham and Brandon Marshall) * Most 100+ yard receiving games (rookie season): 7 * Most 1000+ receiving yard seasons: 2 (one of five players) Life after the NFL Hill returned to his native Alabama when his playing days were finished. He fought a successful battle against alcoholism and returned to his alma mater (then known as Florence State Teachers College), serving as an assistant football coach for the University of North Alabama in the late 1960s while also working toward a Master's degree in Education. After earning his Master's in 1969 he became a public school teacher and coach at Brooks High School, eventually becoming the school's principal. In 1986 a new award was created to highlight America's best NCAA Division II players, named the Harlon Hill Trophy in honor of his playing career. Often considered the Division II equivalent of the Heisman Trophy, it is awarded annually during the NCAA Division II Football Championship weekend in Florence, Alabama. Hill retired from the Lauderdale County, Alabama, school system and resided in Alabama until his death. Hill died March 21, 2013, at Eliza Coffee Memorial Hospital in Florence, Alabama, following a prolonged illness.

It was written in 1970 by all four members of the group. Containing several extended instrumental passages, largely ambient sound effects, and musical improvisation, the track has a running time of 23:31 and comprises the entire second side of the vinyl and cassette recordings. It also appears in shortened form as the fifth track on the compilation album which took its name, Echoes: The Best of Pink Floyd. The composition was originally assembled from separate fragments. It was later split in two parts to serve as both the opening and closing numbers in the band's film Live at Pompeii. The song was used to open the band's 1987 A Momentary Lapse of Reason Tour after not having been played for more than a decade, but was retired again after eleven shows. It was revived for Gilmour's 2006 On an Island Tour, where it was performed at every show. Live versions were released on Gilmour's albums Live in Gda≈Ñsk and Remember That Night.  Structure  The song begins with a \\"ping sound\\", created as a result of an experiment very early in the Meddle sessions, produced by amplifying a grand piano played by Richard Wright, and sending the signal through a Leslie speaker and a Binson Echorec unit. After several \\"pings\\", a slide guitar played by David Gilmour gradually joins. Gilmour used a slide guitar in other certain sound effects on the studio recording and for the introduction in live performances from 1971 to 1975. The song adopts a structure that changes between C# minor and F# minor, with all instruments joining in for two swells of C# major/B‚ô≠, A major, and G#sus4 which resolves to a G# major. After three minutes, the instruments play in C# minor in 4/4 time, and the main verses are sung in harmony by Gilmour and Wright. In place of a chorus, a guitar riff descends chromatically from C# to A, and re-ascends chromatically to C#, several times before playing E major, B major, and C major. Another verse and \\"chorus\\" follow the first, and then a guitar solo plays over a verse progression and climaxes at the end of two \\"chorus\\" progressions. In some live versions, a third \\"chorus\\" progression was added. Following the climax is the beginning of an extended improvisatory passage, at the seven-minute mark. The bass guitar, played by Roger Waters, plays a repeating sequence of B and C#, while drummer Nick Mason plays a driving 4/4 beat and Wright plays accompaniment on a Hammond organ. Gilmour plays several short, sometimes distorted, guitar solos in C# minor as well as E major, F# major, A major, and B major. At eleven minutes, the improvisatory section crossfades with the \\"noise\\" section of the song which begins with a \\"wind\\" crescendo, created by Waters using a guitar slide on his bass strings and sending the signal through a Binson Echorec. A high-pitched screeching noise, played by Gilmour on guitar, is prominent during this largely ambient section. After observing the song being created, Nick Mason noted: \\"The guitar sound in the middle section of 'Echoes' was created inadvertently by David plugging in a wah-wah pedal back to front. Sometimes great effects are the results of this kind of pure serendipity, and we were always prepared to see if something might work on a track. The grounding we'd received from Ron Geesin in going beyond the manual had left its mark.\\" Harmonic \\"whistles\\" can be heard produced by Wright pulling certain drawbars in and out on the Hammond organ. Rooks were added to the music from a tape archive recording (as had been done for some of the band's earlier songs, including \\"Set the Controls for the Heart of the Sun\\"). At fifteen minutes, the \\"noise\\" section melts away and a Farfisa Compact Duo organ played by Wright fades in. Several more \\"ping\\" noises are heard, and then an extended \\"build-up\\" sequence plays over B minor, F# minor, Bm/D, and A/E. Mason's cymbals begin faintly, then crescendo as the section continues. Gilmour plays muted guitar notes to match the bassline, which Waters himself begins halfway through the section. Wright plays an organ solo, which lasts through the end of the \\"build-up\\". At the end of the \\"build-up\\" is a musical climax, where Gilmour plays high guitar notes in A major while the rest of the band plays only the bass notes. Following this is a short sequence structurally similar to the \\"build-up\\", except the entire chord progression is transposed up a whole tone to match the tonic of the song, C# minor. The end of the instrumental climax leads into the song's third verse, followed by another \\"chorus\\". The band plays over two more \\"chorus\\" structures, and then a repeated, quiet verse progression serves as the outro of the song. In this section, a \\"choral\\"-sounding segment is heard. This was created by placing two tape recorders in opposite corners of a room; the main chord tapes of the song were then fed into one recorder and played back while at the same time recording. The other recorder was then also set to play what was being recorded; this created a delay between both recordings, heavily influencing the structure of the chords while at the same time giving it a very \\"wet\\" and \\"echoey\\" feel. This effect also results in a Shepard-Risset glissando. Composition The piece had its genesis in a collection of separate musical experiments written by the band, some of which had been left over from previous sessions. The group then arranged the pieces in order to make a coherent 23-minute piece originally referred to as \\"Nothing, Parts 1‚Äì24\\". Not all of the pieces were used for the finished track, and out-takes included saying a phrase backwards, so it would sound correct yet strange when the tape was reversed. Subsequent tapes of work in progress were labelled \\"The Son of Nothing\\" and \\"The Return of the Son of Nothing\\"; the latter title was eventually used to introduce the as-yet unreleased work during its first live performances in early 1971. Studio recording was split between Abbey Road Studios, Morgan Studios and AIR Studios in London; the latter two were used because they had a 16-track recorder, which made assembling the individual components of the songs easier. In an interview in 2008 with Mojo, when asked who had composed \\"Echoes\\", Wright stated he had composed the long piano intro and the main chord progression of the song. In the same interview he confirmed that Waters wrote the lyrics. During this stage of its development, the song's first verse had yet to be finalised. It originally referred to the meeting of two celestial bodies. The first verse originally took words from Muhammad Iqbal's poem \\"Two Planets\\", and later this was rewritten with the incorporation of original underwater imagery instead. The title \\"Echoes\\" was also subjected to significant revisions before and after the release of Meddle: Waters, a devoted football fan, proposed that the band call its new piece \\"We Won the Double\\" in celebration of Arsenal's 1971 victory, and during a 1972 tour of Germany he jovially introduced it on two consecutive nights as \\"Looking Through the Knothole in Granny's Wooden Leg\\" (a reference to The Goon Show) and The Dam Busters, respectively. Live performances Pink Floyd first performed \\"Echoes\\" at Norwich Lads Club on 22 April 1971. It was a regular part of the band's set up to the concert at Knebworth Park on 5 July 1975. The song was performed for Live at Pompeii, where it was split in two halves to open and close the film. The 1974 and 1975 performances featured backing vocals by Venetta Fields and Carlena Williams and saxophone solos by Dick Parry instead of the guitar solos in the 1971‚Äì73 performances (apart from the first show of the US 1975 tour, where Gilmour does the first middle solo then gives way to Parry's sax). It was performed eleven times on the band's 1987 A Momentary Lapse of Reason tour, in a slightly rearranged version trimmed down to 17 minutes. It was then replaced by \\"Shine On You Crazy Diamond\\". Gilmour resurrected the song on his 2006 On an Island Tour as the closing number of the main set. He and keyboardist Rick Wright swapped vocal parts with Gilmour singing the high parts and Wright the low parts ‚Äì the opposite to how it was performed previously. Wright would bring the Farfisa out of retirement just for this song for the tour. These performances appear on Gilmour's Remember That Night film and Live in Gda≈Ñsk album/film. Gilmour told Rolling Stone in 2016 upon returning to Pompeii to play a solo show that he would have loved to perform \\"Echoes\\" but felt he could not do so without Wright, who had died in 2008 ‚Äì \\"There's something that's specifically so individual about the way that Rick and I play in that, that you can't get someone to learn it and do it just like that.\\" Reception In a review for the Meddle album, Jean-Charles Costa of Rolling Stone gave \\"Echoes\\" a positive review. Costa described \\"Echoes\\" as \\"a 23-minute Pink Floyd aural extravaganza that takes up all of side two, recaptures, within a new musical framework, some of the old themes and melody lines from earlier albums.\\" Costa further went on: \\"All of this plus a funky organ-bass-drums segment and a stunning Gilmour solo adds up to a fine extended electronic outing.\\" Echoes and 2001: A Space Odyssey synchronisation rumours Similar to the Dark Side of the Rainbow effect, at-large rumours suggested that \\"Echoes\\" coincidentally synchronises with Stanley Kubrick's 1968 film 2001: A Space Odyssey, when played concurrently with the final 23-minute segment titled \\"Jupiter and Beyond the Infinite\\". At the time of the film's production in 1967‚Äì1968, Pink Floyd was not working on any material suitable for the film, nor were they contacted about supplying music. It is likely that Kubrick never heard the band's music until after the film was finished. Kubrick would later feature copies of both the soundtrack to 2001 and Pink Floyd‚Äôs Atom Heart Mother as props in the record store scene in A Clockwork Orange. The 1973 George Greenough film Crystal Voyager concludes with a 23-minute segment in which the full version of \\"Echoes\\" accompanies a montage of images shot by Greenough from a camera mounted on his back while surfing on his kneeboard. The group reportedly allowed Greenough and director David Elfick to use the music in their film in exchange for the use of Greenough's footage as a visual background when they performed \\"Echoes\\" in concert. Alleged plagiarism In interviews promoting Amused to Death, Waters claimed that Andrew Lloyd Webber had plagiarised the riff from \\"Echoes\\" for sections of the musical The Phantom of the Opera; nevertheless, he decided not to file a lawsuit regarding the matter. He said: At 3:50 into \\"Echoes\\" the allegedly stolen riff is first heard. Webber utilized it as the first sounds of the \\"Overture\\" from Phantom of the Opera.

He was a leading authority on sleep, sleep deprivation and the diagnosis and treatment of sleep disorders such as sleep apnea and narcolepsy. For this pioneering work in a previously uncharted field in the United States, he is sometimes referred to as the American father of sleep medicine. Biography Dement was born in Wenatchee, Washington in 1928. In the 1950s, of those who also studied at the University of Chicago he was the first to intensively study the connection between rapid eye movement and dreaming. His fellow student Eugene Aserinsky had mentioned to him that \\"Dr. Kleitman and I think these eye movements might be related to dreaming\\". Aserinsky, along with his and Dement's adviser Nathaniel Kleitman, had previously noticed the connection but hadn't considered it very interesting. Dement had an interest in psychiatry, which in those days considered dreams to be important, so he was excited by the discovery and was eager to pursue it. He began his work in sleep deprivation at Mount Sinai Hospital in the late 1950s - the early 1960s. In 1964, he monitored and assisted Randy Gardner's successful attempt to break the record for longest time without sleep. He was among the first researchers to study sleeping subjects with the electroencephalogram (EEG), and he wrote \\"I believe that the study of sleep became a true scientific field in 1953, when I finally was able to make all-night, continuous recordings of brain and eye activity during sleep.\\" Studying these recordings, he discovered and named the five stages of sleep. pp. 35-38. In collaboration with Dr. Christian Guilleminault, Dement proposed the measure that is still used for the clinical definition of sleep apnea and the rating of its severity, the Apnea Hypopnea Index (AHI). pp. 174. Dement, Professor of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences at Stanford University School of Medicine, taught the large and popular \\"Sleep and Dreams\\" course at Stanford, which started in 1971. In 1975 he launched the American Sleep Disorders Association, now known as the American Academy of Sleep Medicine, and served as president for its first twelve years. In that same year he and Mary Carskadon invented the Multiple Sleep Latency Test used to measure sleepiness, a test of how quickly people fall asleep, sleep onset latency, during several daytime opportunities. He was also chairman of the National Commission on Sleep Disorders Research, whose final report led directly to the creation of a new agency within the National Institutes of Health, the National Center on Sleep Disorders Research. Dement was the author of The Promise of Sleep and The Sleepwatchers, and wrote the first undergraduate textbook in the field.. The Promise of Sleep was featured in the 2012 independent comedy film Sleepwalk with Me, and Dement also made a cameo appearance in the film. At the start of his academic career, he was a jazz musician and played bass. While at the University of Washington he played with Quincy Jones, a time during which he also befriended Ray Charles. During the late 1980s, while at Stanford, he was known to have played, on at least one occasion, with artist-in-residence, Stan Getz. pp. 239. He lived with his family in northern California.

At Kew he founded the Herbarium and enlarged the gardens and arboretum. Hooker was born and educated in Norwich. An inheritance gave him the means to travel and to devote himself to the study of natural history, particularly botany. He published his account of an expedition to Iceland in 1809, but even though his notes and specimens were destroyed during his voyage home. He married Maria, the eldest daughter of the Norfolk banker Dawson Turner, in 1815, afterwards living in Halesworth for 11 years, where he established a herbarium that became renowned by botanists at the time. He held the post of Regius Professor of Botany at Glasgow University, where he worked with the botanist and lithographer Thomas Hopkirk and enjoyed the supportive friendship of Joseph Banks for his exploring, collecting and organising work. in 1841 he succeeded William Townsend Aiton as Director of the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew. He expanded the gardens at Kew, built new glasshouses, and established an arboretum and a museum of economic botany. Among his publications are The British Jungermanniae (1816), Flora Scotica (1821), and Species Filicum (184664).

He attended the Norwich Grammar School from about 1792 until his late teens, but none of the school records from the period he was there have been kept, and little is known of his schooldays. He developed an interest in entomology, reading and natural history during his boyhood. In 1805, Hooker discovered a moss (now known as Buxbaumia aphylla) when out walking on Rackheath, north of Norwich. He visited the Norwich botanist Sir James Edward Smith to consult his Linnean collections. Smith advised the young Hooker to contact the botanist Dawson Turner about his discovery. Upon reaching the age of 21 he inherited an estate in Kent from his godfather. His independent means allowed him to travel and develop his interest in natural history. As a young man Hooker was fascinated by the birds of Norfolk and spent time studying them on the Broads and the Norfolk coast. He became skilled in drawing them and understanding their behaviour. He also studied insects and, when still at school, his skills were appreciated by the Reverend William Kirby. In 1805, Kirby dedicated the Omphalapion hookerorum, a species of weevil, to him and his brother Joseph: \\"I am indebted to an excellent naturalist, Mr. W. J. Hooker, of Norwich, who first discovered it, for this species. Many other nondescripts have been taken by him and his brother, Mr. J. Hooker, and I name this insect after them, as a memorial of my sense of their ability and exertions in the service of my favourite department of natural history.\\" In 1805 Hooker went to be trained in estate management at Starston Hall, Norfolk, perhaps because of the need to be able to manage his own newly acquired estates. He lived there with Robert Paul, a gentleman farmer. In 1806 he was introduced to Sir Joseph Banks, the president of the Royal Society. He elected to the Linnean Society of London that year. =Early friends and patrons= Hooker's illustrations for James Edward Smith's paper Characters of Hookeria (1808), about the genus named for Hooker by Smith When a young man, Hooker gained the patronage and friendship of some of most important naturalists in eastern England, including Smith, who had founded the Linnean Society of London in 1788 and owned Carl Linnaeus's collection of plants and books, the botanist and antiquarian Dawson Turner, and Joseph Banks. In 1807, Hooker was bitten by an adder when walking near Burgh Castle and badly hurt. He was found by friends and taken to Dawson Turner's house, where he was cared for until he recovered completely from the effects of the snake's bite. Once he had fully recovered, he accompanied Turner and his wife Mary on a tour of Scotland. In 1808 he again travelled to Scotland, this time accompanied by his friend William Borrer. During this journey he discovered a new species of moss, Andreaea nivalis, on Ben Nevis, which may have led to him publishing a paper Some Observations on the Genus Andreaea in 1810. Hooker produced the illustrations for James Edward Smith's paper Characters of Hookeria, a new Genus of Mosses, with Descriptions of Ten Species, a genus named by Smith in honour of William and his older brother Joseph. Hooker had discovered a specimen of the moss in the countryside around Holt. From 1806 to 1809 he was a constant guest of Dawson Turner in Yarmouth, where he produced the illustrations for Turner's four-volume Historia Fucorum. He also spent time in London, where he took up rooms in Frith Street, near the British Museum. By 1807 Hooker had begun work as a supervising manager at a brewery at Halesworth, in partnership with Dawson Turner and Samuel Paget. Sharing a quarter of the company, he lived in the brewery house, which had a large garden and a greenhouse in which he grew orchids. The brewing venture proved to be unsuccessful, for he had no capacity for business. He remained as the manager there for ten years, living at 15 Quay Street, Halesworth. =Excursions abroad= Sir Joseph Banks, which Hooker included in his Journal of a tour in Iceland (1813) Hooker inherited enough money to be able to travel at his own expense. His first botanical expedition abroad‚Äîat the suggestion of the naturalist Sir Joseph Banks, who had made a previous visit in 1772‚Äîwas to Iceland, in the summer of 1809. He sailed on the Margaret and Anne, arriving at Reykjav√≠k in June. That month an attempt at Icelandic independence was staged by the Danish adventurer J√∏rgen J√∏rgensen. Two months later, HMS Talbot anchored in Reykjav√≠k harbour and her commander promptly deposed and arrested Jorgensen, and restored the governor. During his return voyage, the Margaret and Anne, in a dead calm, was discovered to be on fire, the result of sabotage which was afterwards found to have been planned by Danish prisoners. Hooker and the ship's company were all rescued, but the fire destroyed most of his drawings and notes. Banks later offered Hooker the use of his own papers, and with these materials, along with the surviving parts of his own journal, his good memory aided him to publish an account of the island, its inhabitants and flora: his A Journal of a Tour in Iceland (1809) was privately circulated in 1811 and published two years later. In 1810‚Äì11 he made extensive preparations, and sacrifices which proved financially serious, with a view to travelling to Ceylon, to accompany the newly-appointed governor, Sir Robert Brownrigg. He sold property inherited from his godfather, William Jackson, to raise the necessary capital for the journey. Political upheaval there led to the project being abandoned. In 1812 he was elected a fellow of the Royal Society of London. In 1813, encouraged by Sir Joseph Banks, he considered travelling to Java, but was dissuaded from the idea by friends and family. In 1814 he travelled in Europe for nine months, going to Paris with the Turners, then travelling alone to Switzerland, southern France, and Italy, where he studied plants and visited notable botanists. The following year he married the eldest daughter of his friend Dawson Turner. Settling at Halesworth, he devoted himself to the formation of his herbarium, which became of worldwide renown among botanists. In 1815, he was made a corresponding member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences. =Career in Glasgow= Plan of Glasgow's Royal Botanic Garden in 1825 In February 1820, Hooker was appointed as the regius professorship of botany in the University of Glasgow, taking over from the Scottish physician and botanist Robert Graham, and inheriting a small botanic garden that was underfunded and lacking in plants. In May he was received by the University and read his inaugural thesis in Latin, written by his father-in-law, Dawson Turner. Hooker was faced with the prospect of delivering lectures to students, when he had never previously taught, and was ignorant of some aspects of botany: his position within the medical faculty inspired him to study for a medical degree. He soon became popular as a lecturer, his style being both clear and eloquent, and his people such as local army officers came to attend them. For 15 years he delivered a summer course on botany, required to be studied by all medical students‚Äîfor the remaining months of the year he was free to study, work on his publications and his herbarium, and correspond with other botanists. His classroom was remarkable for having drawings of plants on display to assist the students, and their course included trips to study plants, organised by Hooker. Student numbers increased from 30 in 1820 to 130 ten years later. He earned ¬£144 in his first year, which later increased, but still needed to supplement his income by tutoring two boys from wealthy families, who lived with the family. Hooker in 1834 His years at Glasgow were the his most productive, when he was known as the most active botanist in the country. In 1821 he brought out the Flora Scotica, written to be used by his botany students. He was awarded a doctorate by Glasgow University in 1821. He worked with the lithographer and botanist Thomas Hopkirk to establish the Royal Botanic Institution of Glasgow and to lay out and develop the Botanic Gardens. He was elected a Foreign Honorary Member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1823. Under Hooker, the Botanic Gardens enjoyed remarkable success and became prominent in the botanic world. The garden was his responsibility and he set to work developing it with the help of his extensive network of friends and acquaintances. Principal among these was Sir Joseph Banks, who promised Kew's help. The botanic gardens steadily acquired new plants, often from visiting naturalists, or from students who had travelled. His work on the botanic garden resulted in experts expressing the view that \\"Glasgow would not suffer by comparison with any other establishment in Europe\\". During his professorship at Glasgow, his numerous published works included Flora Londinensis, British Flora, Flora Boreali-Americana, Icones Filicum, The Botany of Captain Beechey's Voyage to the Bering Sea, Icones Plantarum, Exotic Flora (1823-7), 13 volumes of Curtis's Botanical Magazine (from 1827), and the first seven volumes of Annals of Botany. In 1836 Hooker was made a Knight of the Royal Guelphic Order and a Knight Bachelor in recognition of his work at Glasgow and his services to botany. Although officially recognised in this way, he became increasingly disillusioned with how his work was viewed by the University authorities, and by 1839 was feeling as if the \\"dignity of the position was stripped to one of ridicule and his work was dismissed as of no account\\". =Director of Kew Gardens= The origins of the Royal Botanic Gardens at Kew can be traced to the merging of the royal estates of Richmond and Kew in 1772, when the garden at Kew Park formed by Henry, Lord Capell of Tewkesbury was enlarged by Augusta, Dowager Princess of Wales. The gardens were developed by the architect William Chambers, who built the pagoda in 1761, and by George III, who was aided by William Aiton and Sir Joseph Banks. The Dutch House, now known as Kew Palace, was purchased by George III in 1781 for his children. The adjoining White House was demolished in 1802. The plant collections at Kew were first enlarged systematically by Francis Masson in 1771, but had since the death of George III slowly declined. In 1838, a Parliamentary review of the nation's royal gardens recommended the development of Kew as a national botanical garden. The Kew Gardens Palm House, from Tallis's Illustrated London (1851) In April 1841 he was appointed as the Garden's first full time Director, on the resignation of William Townsend Aiton. Following his appointment as director, a position he had long wished for, he wrote \\"I feel as if I were to begin life over again\\", in a letter to Dawson Turner. He started on an annual salary of ¬£300, with an additional allowance of ¬£200. To Allan, who described Hooker as a man with \\"drive, enthusiasm and creative ability\\", he was eminently suited for the post, being a professional botanist, an artist, a leader with connections to others in the botanical world, who was knowledgeable about plants from Britain and those collected from around the world. The curator of Kew Gardens during Hooker's period as Director was the experienced and knowledgeable botanist John Smith (1798‚Äì1888). Under Hooker's direction the gardens expanded considerably in size. Initially about in size, they were extended to in 1841. An arboretum of was introduced, many new glass-houses were erected, and a museum of economic botany was established. In 1843 the Palm House, to a design by the architect Decimus Burton and the iron founder Richard Turner, was constructed at Kew. The gardens and glasshouses were opened daily to the visiting public, who were allowed to wander freely there for the first time. Sir William himself wandered around during opening hours, lending his advice. Hooker lived with his family at West Park, a large house in which he accommodated 13 rooms of books in his library, which was seen as a public institution by the world's botanical experts, who were never turned away. Among his visitors were Queen Victoria, her husband Prince Albert and their children; during 1865‚Äîthe year Hooker died‚Äîthe attendance had risen to 529,241. . Under Hooker's direction Kew became the centre of an emerging interconnected worldwide network of botanical expertise, and staff recommended by him joined expeditions or worked for botanical gardens around the world. He was invariably consulted when government questions arose about botanical matters. Newly propagated plants and sent from Kew to private and public gardens in Britain, and to botanical gardens overseas, in some cases to be developed as crops. =Marriage and family= Hooker in 1864 In June 1815 he married Maria Sarah Turner,William Jackson Hooker in \\"England, Norfolk, Parish Registers (County Record Office), 1510-1997 FamilySearch (William Jackson Hooker). the eldest daughter of Dawson Turner and Mary Palgrave. Maria was an amateur artist who collected mosses, and who with her sister Elizabeth illustrated them for her husband. The couple toured the Lake District and across Ireland on their honeymoon, before travelling to Scotland. They had five children. William Dawson Hooker (born 1816) was a naturalist who trained as a doctor. He published Notes on Norway (1837 and 1839). He emigrated with his new wife to Jamaica to practise medicine, but died at Kingston, aged 24. Joseph Dalton Hooker (born 1817) became a botanist and was appointed the first assistant director at Kew. He served in this post for 10 years, before taking over as director from his father in 1865. The three daughters in the family were Maria (born 1819), Elizabeth (born 1820), and Mary Harriet (born 1825), who died aged sixteen. =Death= He was engaged on the Synopsis filicum with the botanist John Gilbert Baker when he contracted a throat infection then epidemic at Kew. He died in 1865 and was buried at St. Anne's Church, Kew. He was succeeded at Kew Gardens by his son. Works Jackson studied mosses, liverworts, and ferns, and published a monograph on a group of liverworts, British Jungermanniae, in 1816. This was succeeded by a new edition of William Curtis's Flora Londinensis, for which he wrote the descriptions (18171828); by a description of the Plantae cryptogamicae of Alexander von Humboldt and Aim√© Bonpland; by the Muscologia, a very complete account of the mosses of Britain and Ireland, prepared in conjunction with Thomas Taylor and first published in 1818; and by his Musci exotici (2 volumes, 18181820), devoted to new foreign mosses and other cryptogamic plants. Hooker published more than 20 major botanical works over a period of 50 years, including British Jungermanniae (1816), Musci Exotici (18181820), Icones Filicum (18291831), Genera Filicum (1838) and Species Filicum (18461864). Other works include Flora Scotica (1821), The British Flora (1830) and Flora Borealis Americana; or, The Botany of the Northern Parts of British America (1840). =Examples= File:The paradisus londinensis (8317590251).jpgalt=illustration of flower species Bromelia aquilegia, from The Paradisus Londinensis (1805) File:The paradisus londinensis (8317612271).jpgalt=illustration of flower species Linum hypericifilum from The Paradisus Londinensis (1807) File:William Jackson Hooker - illustration for his paper 'Some Observations on the Genus Andraea'.jpgalt=illustration of plant species Some Observations on the Genus Andraea (1810) File:Hooker - Jungermannia Spinulosa.jpgalt=illustration of plant species Jungermannia Spinulosa, from Hooker's first scientific work, British Jungermanniae (1816) File:Curtis's botanical magazine (Plate 3088) (8410403017).jpgalt=illustration of plant species Xanthochymus dulcis, from Curtis's Botanical Magazine (1831) File:Flora boreali-Americana, or, The botany of the northern parts of British America (microform) - compiled principally from the plants collected by Dr. Richardson and Mr. Drummond on the late northern (20631052015).jpgalt=illustration of plant species Valeriana pauciflora, from Flora boreali-Americana (1840) File:The botany of Captain Beechey's voyage; comprising an acount of the plants collected by Messrs.

He had previously been a government minister under Andrew Fisher and Billy Hughes. Tudor was born in Melbourne to Welsh immigrant parents. He left school at a young age to enter the workforce, serving an apprenticeship in the felt hat industry and later studying his trade for periods in England and the United States. He became involved in trade unionism in England, and after returning to Australia served as president of the Felt Hatters' Union. Tudor was elected president of the Victorian Trades Hall Council in 1900. The following year, he was elected to the new federal parliament as a representative of the Labor Party. He was chosen as the parliamentary party's first whip, and held that position until entering cabinet in 1908. Tudor served as Minister for Trade and Customs from 1908 to 1909, 1910 to 1913, and 1914 to 1916, in the governments of Andrew Fisher and Billy Hughes. He remained loyal to the Labor Party during the split over conscription in 1916, and was elected party leader after Hughes' expulsion. He replaced Joseph Cook as leader of the opposition upon the formation of the third Hughes Ministry in February 1917. Tudor led Labor to the 1917 and 1919 federal elections, on both occasions suffering heavy defeats. His death in office at the age of 55 came after a long period of ill health. He was the first leader of a major Australian political party to die in office, and was accorded a state funeral. Early life Tudor was born to John Llewellyn Tudor, a ballastman, and Ellen Charlotte Tudor, n√©e Burt, both of Welsh origin, on 29 January 1866 at Williamstown, Victoria. However, the family soon moved to the Melbourne suburb of Richmond, where Tudor lived most of his life. Upon leaving Richmond Central State School, and after short spells in a sawmill and a boot factory, Tudor entered the felt hat industry. Tudor apprenticed in Abbotsford and then travelled across Victoria in the hat trade. Tudor went to England, working in London, Birmingham, Liverpool and Manchester, marrying Alice Smale in Denton, Lancashire in 1894. Smale died the same year, but Tudor continued in the felt hat trade by moving to London and becoming vice-president of the local branch of the Felt Hatters' Union. In 1897 Tudor remarried to Fanny Jane Mead. As vice-president of the union Tudor became interested in union politics (as many Labor politicians were before their entry into politics) and persuaded the British unions to adopt the union label principle. Returning to Australia, Tudor worked at Abbotsford's mills and took a seat in the Victorian Trades Hall Council. In 1900 he became president. Tudor was president of the Victorian Life Saving Society, and held a Bronze Medallion as a qualified life saver.The Australian Worker, 20 May 1915 He had a long association with the Richmond Football Club, and served as club president from 1909 to 1918. Entry into politics Tudor early in his political career A prominent figure in Richmond, Victoria, Tudor turned the Division of Yarra into the safest Labor seat in the country by winning that seat by a large margin in the 1901 federal election. Tudor was a deacon of the Congregational Church and angered some Protestants with his calls for Home Rule for Ireland. Frontbencher Tudor in 1908 Tudor was immediately elected the Labor Party's whip and assistant secretary, before ascending to the position of secretary in 1904. Under the leadership of Andrew Fisher, he was Minister for Trade and Customs during the three Fisher ministries, from 1908‚Äì1909, 1910‚Äì1913, and 1914‚Äì1915. According to the Australian Dictionary of Biography, he was an \\"efficient administrator, with an eye for detail\\" who \\"made friends and earned respect on both sides of the House, and was considered to be the most moderate of the Victorian Labor members\\". Billy Hughes replaced Fisher as prime minister in 1915. Tudor maintained his position in the ministry, and initially remained neutral during the debate within the ALP over overseas conscription, which Hughes supported. After pressure from his local political labour council in Richmond, he eventually came out against conscription and resigned from the ministry in September 1916. Tudor became a leader of the \\"No\\" campaign during the 1916 conscription referendum, alongside T. J. Ryan and William Higgs. On 14 November, the ALP split irrevocably over the issue. Hughes led his supporters out of a caucus meeting and formed a new National Labor Party, allowing him to stay on as prime minister with the aid of the Liberals. Tudor was elected unopposed as the new leader of the Labor Party in his place ‚Äì the party's first Australian- born leader. According to historian Denis Murphy, he was likely elected to the leadership simply because he was the first member of cabinet to resign over the issue. Tudor did not succeed Liberal leader Joseph Cook as Leader of the Opposition until 17 February 1917, when the Third Hughes Ministry was sworn in with Hughes as leader of the composite Nationalist Party. Leader of the Opposition Undated photo Tudor led his party to a landslide defeat at the 1917 federal election. The ALP won just 22 seats out of 75, and the party was severely weakened by several of its senior figures following Hughes out of the party. Tudor was a leader of the successful \\"No\\" campaign at the 1917 conscription referendum. He was not regarded as a good public speaker, and his speeches were often seen as dull or confusing. While Tudor was respected within the ALP for his loyalty, he was often overshadowed by T. J. Ryan, the charismatic premier of Queensland. Ryan was the only remaining ALP premier in the country, and frequently campaigned outside his own state. In May 1918, Tudor had to officially deny a report in The Age that he would step aside in favour of Ryan prior to the next federal election. There was also some speculation that Fisher ‚Äì who had been appointed High Commissioner to the United Kingdom ‚Äì would return and resume the leadership. In May 1919, their former cabinet colleague King O'Malley wrote to Fisher in London that \\"many people are of the opinion that Labor will not win the next election under Tudor's leadership\\". Caricature of Tudor published in 1920 In October 1919, the ALP Federal Conference passed a resolution inviting Ryan to enter federal politics and appointed him as national campaign director. Tudor was \\"unconsciously insulted\\" by a number of delegates, who effectively declared that he could not lead Labor to an election victory. His leadership was defended by his supporters in the Victorian delegation, who threatened a walkout, and also by those who viewed the resolution as usurping the role of the party caucus in choosing their leader. At the election later that year, Tudor led the ALP to a second heavy election loss ‚Äì 26 seats out of 75. He was twice taken ill during the campaign with \\"attacks of hemorrhage\\". Tudor was increasingly seen as an ineffectual leader, and several elements were contemplating replacing him with Ryan. However, Ryan's early death in 1921 prevented him from taking Tudor's place. Tudor's own health became markedly worse during 1921, and he was increasingly unable to carry out his duties. In September 1921, the party elected Matthew Charlton as assistant leader in the House of Representatives. Death On 10 January 1922, Tudor died, aged 55. He was the first leader of the Labor Party to die in office, and the first Opposition Leader never to become Prime Minister. He was succeeded as the member for Yarra by future Prime Minister James Scullin. Tudor was the first of five consecutive Opposition Leaders who was not a former Prime Minister. Tudor's estate was valued at ¬£4,629, around half of which was real estate. His widow went bankrupt within the year, after her brother's firm (in which she had invested most of her money) went broke.\\"WITHOUT RESOURCES: Late Frank Tudor's Widow\\", The Sun, 31 October 1922. Kim E. Beazley, who wrote a series of articles on ALP leaders for The Canberra Times in 1966, wrote of Tudor that he \\"held the Labor movement together in the face of massive forces of disintegration, and he did it by his dignity and utter absence of bitterness, hate or rancour\\".

Early life and family Elias Howe Jr. was born on July 9, 1819, to Dr. Elias Howe Sr. and Polly (Bemis) Howe in Spencer, Massachusetts. Howe spent his childhood and early adult years in Massachusetts, where he apprenticed in a textile factory in Lowell beginning in 1835. After mill closings due to the Panic of 1837, he moved to Cambridge, Massachusetts, to work as a mechanic with carding machinery, apprenticing along with his cousin Nathaniel P. Banks. Beginning in 1838, he apprenticed in the shop of Ari Davis, a master mechanic in Cambridge who specialized in the manufacture and repair of chronometers and other precision instruments. It was in the employ of Davis that Howe seized upon the idea of the sewing machine. He married Elizabeth Jennings Ames, daughter of Simon Ames and Jane B. Ames, on March 3, 1841, in Cambridge.Edmund Rice (1638) Association, 2009. Descendants of Edmund Rice: The First Nine Generations. (CD-ROM) They had three children: Jane Robinson Howe (1842‚Äì1912), Simon Ames Howe (1844‚Äì1883), and Julia Maria Howe (1846‚Äì1869). Invention of sewing machine and career Howe's sewing machine Howe was not the first to conceive of the idea of a sewing machine. Many other people had formulated the idea of such a machine before him, one as early as 1790, and some had even patented their designs and produced working machines, in one case at least 80 of them. However, Howe originated significant refinements to the design concepts of his predecessors, and on September 10, 1846, he was awarded the first United States patent () for a sewing machine using a lockstitch design. His machine contained the three essential features common to most modern machines: a needle with the eye at the point, a shuttle operating beneath the cloth to form the lock stitch, and an automatic feed. A possibly apocryphal account of how he came up with the idea for placing the eye of the needle at the point is recorded in a family history of his mother's family: \\"He almost beggared himself before he discovered where the eye of the needle of the sewing machine should be located. It is probable that there are very few people who know how it came about. His original idea was to follow the model of the ordinary needle, and have the eye at the heel. It never occurred to him that it should be placed near the point, and he might have failed altogether if he had not dreamed he was building a sewing machine for a savage king in a strange country. Just as in his actual working experience, he was perplexed about the needle's eye. He thought the king gave him twenty-four hours in which to complete the machine and make it sew. If not finished in that time death was to be the punishment. Howe worked and worked, and puzzled, and finally gave it up. Then he thought he was taken out to be executed. He noticed that the warriors carried spears that were pierced near the head. Instantly came the solution of the difficulty, and while the inventor was begging for time, he awoke. It was 4 o'clock in the morning. He jumped out of bed, ran to his workshop, and by 9, a needle with an eye at the point had been rudely modeled. After that it was easy. That is the true story of an important incident in the invention of the sewing machine.\\"Waln-Morgan Draper, Thomas, The Bemis History and Genealogy: Being an Account, in Greater Part, of the Descendants of Joseph Bemis of Watertown, Massachusetts, The Bemis History and Genealogy (Washington [District of Columbia]: Library of Congress, [19--]), pp 159‚Äì162, 1357 Joshua Bemis, FHL Microfilm 1011936 Item 2. Despite securing his patent, Howe had considerable difficulty finding investors in the United States to finance production of his invention, so his elder brother Amasa Bemis Howe traveled to England in October 1846 to seek financing. Amasa was able to sell his first machine for ¬£250 to William Thomas of Cheapside, London, who owned a factory for the manufacture of corsets, umbrellas and valises. Elias and his family joined Amasa in London in 1848, but after business disputes with Thomas and failing health of his wife, Howe returned nearly penniless to the United States. His wife Elizabeth, who preceded Elias back to the United States, died in Cambridge, Massachusetts shortly after his return in 1849. Despite his efforts to sell his machine, other entrepreneurs began manufacturing sewing machines. Howe was forced to defend his patent in a court case that lasted from 1849 to 1854 because he found that Isaac Singer with cooperation from Walter Hunt had perfected a facsimile of his machine and was selling it with the same lockstitch that Howe had invented and patented. He won the dispute and earned considerable royalties from Singer and others for sales of his invention. Howe contributed much of the money he earned to providing equipment for the 17th Connecticut Volunteer Infantry of the Union Army during the Civil War, in which Howe served as a private in Company D. Due to his faltering health he performed light duty, often seen walking with the aid of his shillelagh, and took on the position of Regimental Postmaster, serving out his time riding to and from Baltimore with war news. He'd enlisted August 14, 1862, and then mustered out July 19, 1865.Pro Patria: Civil War monument of Connecticut Involvement in inventing the zipper Howe received a patent in 1851 for an \\"Automatic, Continuous Clothing Closure\\". Perhaps because of the success of his sewing machine, he did not try to seriously market it, missing recognition he might otherwise have received. Later life and legacy Howe commemorative, 1940 Between 1865 and 1867, Elias established The Howe Machine Co. in Bridgeport, Connecticut, that was operated by Elias's sons-in-law, the Stockwell Brothers, until about 1886. Between 1854 and 1871/2, Elias's older brother, Amasa Bemis Howe, and later his son Benjamin Porter Howe, as Amasa died in 1868, owned and operated a factory in New York City, manufacturing sewing machines under the name of the Howe Sewing Machine Co., which won a gold medal at the London Exhibition of 1862.

He co-authored volumes of the scientific results of their expedition. Chimborazo base Humboldt and Bonpland in the Amazon rainforest Biography Bonpland was born as Aim√© Jacques Alexandre Goujaud in La Rochelle, France, on 22, 28,.Parish register. Paroisse Saint-Barth√©l√©my, La Rochelle. Archives d√©partementales, Charente-Maritime, Archives en ligne. or 29 August 1773. His father was a physician and, around 1790, he joined his brother Michael in Paris, where they both studied medicine. From 1791, they attended courses given at Paris's Botanical Museum of Natural History. Their teachers included Jean-Baptiste Lamarck, Antoine Laurent de Jussieu, and Ren√© Louiche Desfontaines; Aim√© further studied under Jean-Nicolas Corvisart and may have attended classes given by Pierre-Joseph Desault at the H√¥tel-Dieu. During this period, Aim√© also befriended his fellow student, Xavier Bichat. Amid the turmoil of the French Revolution and Revolutionary Wars, Bonpland served as a surgeon in the French army or navy. Having befriended Alexander von Humboldt at Corvisart's house, he joined him on a five-year journey through the Canary islands, Venezuela, Cuba, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Mexico, and the United States, as well as the Orinoco and Amazon basins. During this trip, he collected and classified about 6,000 plants that were mostly unknown in Europe up to that time. His account of these findings was published as a series of volumes from 1808 to 1816 entitled Equatorial Plants (). Upon his return to Paris, Napoleon granted him a pension of 3000 francs per year in return for the many specimens he bestowed upon the Museum of Natural History. The Empress Josephine was very fond of him and installed him as superintendent over the gardens at Malmaison, where many seeds he had brought from the Americas were cultivated. In 1813, he published his Description of the Rare Plants Cultivated at Malmaison and in Navarre ('). During this period, he also became acquainted with Gay-Lussac, Arago, and other eminent scientists and, after the abdication of Fontainebleau, vainly pleaded with Napoleon to retire to Venezuela. He was present at Josephine's deathbed. In 1816, he took various European plants to Buenos Aires, where he was elected professor of natural history. He soon left his post, however, to explore the interior of South America. In 1821, he established a colony at Santa Ana near the Paran√° for the specific object of harvesting and selling yerba mate. The colony was located in territory claimed by both Paraguay and Argentina; further, Jos√© Gaspar Rodr√≠guez de Francia, governor of Paraguay, \\"feared that Bonpland's success in cultivating mate would interfere with his own attempt to monopolize that business.\\"George Sarton (1943) \\"Aim√© Bonpland (1773‚Äì1858)\\", Isis 34: 385‚Äì99, reprinted in George Sarton on the History of Science (1962), Dorothy Stimson editor, Harvard University Press The Paraguayans therefore destroyed the colony on December 8,1821, and Bonpland was arrested as a spy and detained at Santa Maria, Paraguay Rengger, Johan Rudolf: (1827) Ensayo Historico until 1829.. During his captivity, he married and had several children.Schinini, Aurelio (2013) Aim√© Bonpland: Un naturalista franc√©s en Corrientes. He was given freedom of movement and acted as a physician for the local poor and the military garrison. At the same epoch, the Swiss naturalist Johann Rudolph Rengger also stayed in Paraguay: he was not allowed to cross the strictly guarded border, but was free to circulate pending the request of a special permit for each excursion. Bonpland was freed in 1829 and in 1831 returned to Argentina, where he settled at San Borja in Corrientes. There, aged 58, he married a local woman and made a living farming and trading in yerba mate.. In 1853, he returned to Santa Ana, where he cultivated the orange trees he had introduced. He received a piastre estate from the Corrientes government in gratitude for his work in the province. The small town around it is now known as \\"Bonpland\\" in his honor. A different small town in Misiones province just south of Santa Ana (Misiones) is also named Bonpland. He died at age 84, at San Borja, Santa Ana, or Restauraci√≥n on 4 or 11 May 1858, before his planned return to Paris. Legacy Bonpland's biography was written by Adolphe Brunel.Paris, 1872. A fictionalized account of his travels with Humboldt occurs in Daniel Kehlmann's Die Vermessung der Welt, translated by Carol Brown Janeway as Measuring the World: A Novel. Bonpland Street in the ritzy Buenos Aires neighborhood of Palermo Hollywood lies among streets named after Charles Darwin, Robert FitzRoy, and Alexander von Humboldt. There is also a Bonpland Street in the city of Bah√≠a Blanca, Argentina, in Caracas, Venezuela, and in Montevideo, Uruguay. Many animals and plants are also named in his honor, including the squid Grimalditeuthis bonplandi and the orchid Ornithocephalus bonplandi. The lunar crater Bonpland is named after him. Also Pico Bonpland in the Venezuelan Andes is named to his honor, although he never visited the Venezuelan Andes. A peak of over in New Zealand also bears his name.

Built at the Boston Navy Yard  Vermont was one of nine 74-gun warships authorized by United States Congress on 29 April 1816. She was laid down at the Boston Navy Yard in Boston, Massachusetts, in September 1818, finished about 1825, and kept on the stocks until finally launched on 15 September 1848 in the interest of both space and fire safety considerations. However, Vermont was not commissioned at this time. Instead the already aged ship-of-the-line remained in ordinary at Boston until the outbreak of the American Civil War in April 1861.  Civil War service  = Assigned to duty with the South Atlantic blockade = USS Vermont (at left) and USS New Orleans (right) USS Vermont in 1898 By the time Civil War broke out, the cavernous hull of the vessel was badly needed as a store and receiving ship at Port Royal, South Carolina, and she was commissioned at Boston on 30 January 1862, Commander Augustus S. Baldwin in command. She received orders to sail for Port Royal for duty with Rear Admiral Samuel F. Du Pont's South Atlantic Blockading Squadron on 17 February 1862 and left Boston on 24 February 1862 under tow by the steamer Kensington. That evening, a violent northwest gale accompanied by snow struck the vessels while they were off Cape Cod Light, Massachusetts. Kensington let go the tow lines, but Vermont refused to obey her helm, broached, and had all her sails and most of her boats blown and torn away. The gale raged for 50 hours; and, by the morning of 26 February 1862, Vermont was drifting eastward with no rudder, her berth deck flooded, and much of the interior of the vessel destroyed. Later on 26 February, Vermont sighted the schooner Flying Mist, hailed her, put a man on board, and persuaded her captain to return to the United States East Coast and report the helpless condition of the ship to naval authorities. Rescue vessels began to reach the stricken ship on 7 March 1862 and enabled Vermont to sail into Port Royal under her own power on 12 April 1862. = Service as an auxiliary = Vermont remained anchored at Port Royal, where she served the South Atlantic Blockading Squadron as an ordnance, hospital, receiving, and store ship and drew praise from Rear Admiral Du Pont. On 12 December 1863, she rescued the crew of the American bark Alice Provost, which was wrecked while trying to enter port at Port Royal.Gaines, W. Craig, Encyclopedia of Civil War Shipwrecks, Louisiana State University Press, 2008, , p. 141. United States Secretary of the Navy Gideon Welles ordered Vermont to return to New York City for \\"public service\\" on 25 July 1864. She left Port Royal on 2 August 1864 and was replaced there by her sister ship-of-the-line . Vermont at the Brooklyn Navy Yard in 1898.  Post-war service  Vermont remained at the New York Navy Yard in Brooklyn, New York, for the next 37 years, serving both as a store and receiving ship. She was condemned and struck from the Navy list on 19 December 1901 and was sold at New York on 17 April 1902.

Eldridge R. Johnson, the founder and president of the Victor Talking Machine Company, donated his house on Hazelhurst Avenue to this cause. The house was demolished and a new Merion Tribute House was built on its foundation. It was built with careful attention to detail, with Gothic patterns and local stone. The stone was shaped on site and window mullions all hand cut to match. The Tribute House is still used today for meetings of the Merion Civic Association and is supported by renting the space for parties or meetings. Merion also has its own public elementary school‚ÄîMerion Elementary of the Lower Merion School District on South Bowman Avenue.Jones, Dick.

In addition to public Merion Elementary, Catholic, all-girls Merion Mercy Academy and its feeder school, Catholic, coeducational Waldron Mercy Academy, and Kohelet Yeshiva High School, formerly Stern Hebrew High School, are located found in Merion Station. Before its campus change to Bryn Mawr, Akiba Hebrew Academy was located in Merion Station as was Episcopal Academy prior to its campus consolidation in Newtown Square. Merion Botanical Park is located between Merion Road and the railroad tracks and City Line Ave and Civic Center Drive. Saint Joseph's University straddles City Avenue. It also purchased and repurposed the former Episcopal Academy campus on the Merion Stationside of the Avenue to contain classroom and student activity buildings.Agreement Finalized With St. Joseph's University - August 18, 2005 The University bought and renovated Merion Gardens Apartments, at the northwest corner of the East Wynnewood Road/City Avenue intersection, for student housing.  Transportation  The Paoli/Thorndale Line, originally part of the Pennsylvania Railroad, was built through Merion station in the late 19th century. Most SEPTA trains heading east to Philadelphia or west to Thorndale stop at Merion Station, located in the center of Merion Station. Other public transportation options in Merion Station include the SEPTA Route 44 buses that travels along Old Lancaster Road and Montgomery Avenue between Ardmore and Center City, some of which stop at the Narberth Station; the SEPTA Route 65 bus that traverses the length of City Line Avenue; and the SEPTA Route 105 bus that runs the entire length of the Main Line along Lancaster Avenue (Route 30) and stops at the Wynnewood Shopping Center. All are within walking distance of Merion Station.  Demographics and government  Merion Station is located in zipcode 19066. Lower Merion Township is responsible for all governance. According to the United States Census, 2000 Merion Station has 5,951 residents, 93.6% of whom are White; 2.1% are Black or African American; 2.7% are Asian; and 1.3% are Hispanic or Latino. 95.1% have a high school diploma or higher and 76.7% have a bachelor's degree or higher. 9.4% were born in a foreign country. 12.3% speak a language other than English at home, and out of that percentage the number that speak Hebrew at home is 10.1%. The median household income in 1999 was $103,229, and 2.7% of individuals were below the poverty line. Faith Communities Merion Station has a comparatively large Jewish population and serves as home to Temple Adath Israel of the Main Line, a Conservative Jewish congregation. Its Orthodox Jewish population is served by Lower Merion Synagogue on Old Lancaster Road, Aish HaTorah on Montgomery Avenue, Young Israel of the Main Line on Montgomery Avenue, and the Chabad Center of the Main Line, located in the former General Wayne Inn on Montgomery Avenue. Reform Jews in Merion are likely to travel a mile west up Montgomery Avenue to Main Line Reform Temple-Beth Elohim, to Gladwyne's Beth David Congregation, or to Congregation Rodeph Shalom on North Broad Street in Center City.  Shopping  The main commercial area of Merion Station is located along Montgomery Avenue east and west of its intersection with Old Lancaster Road and extends into neighboring Bala Cynwyd, officially known as the Merion- Cynwyd Commercial District. It includes restaurants, gift shops and other stores, and local landmarks more than a half century old whose reputations extend well beyond Merion Station's limits, notably Hymie's Merion Delicatessen, The Tavern Restaurant, Murray's Delicatessen, Babis's Pharmacy, Bob Wark's Liberty Service Station, Bala Pizza, and the Township Cleaners.  Hospitals  Merion Station is served by Lankenau Medical Center which is part of the larger Main Line Health Systemwhich includes Bryn Mawr Hospital and Paoli Hospital. Lankenau, on Lancaster Avenue (U.S. Route 30) in nearby Wynnewood near the Overbrook border, has traditionally been affiliated with either Jefferson or Hahnemann (now Drexel) colleges of medicine and is always (with Bryn Mawr and Paoli) on the list of the nation's top community hospitals. The Lankenau Hospital campus includes affiliated doctors' office and medical services in Medical Building East, Medical Build West and Saunders House, a rehabilitation facility, is located adjacent to Lankenau Hospital. Neighborhoods The community north of Montgomery Avenue surrounding General Wayne Park is usually referred to as Merion Park and is in the same zipcode as Merion Station. It was built by developer Ralph Madway decades after the closing of the General Wayne Racetrack that once drew thousands of spectators to Merion for horse races on the green now the Park's grounds and bounded by Maplewood and Revere Roads.

His reign was characterized by ruthless and ambitious efforts to conquer Roman territory to the extent that in the Liber Pontificalis, he is described as a \\"shameless\\" Lombard given to \\"pernicious savagery\\" and cruelty. Biography Aistulf was born as the son of Duke Pemmo of Friuli and his wife Ratperga. After his brother Ratchis became king, Aistulf succeeded him as Duke of Friuli and later succeeded him as king, when Ratchis was forced to abdicate the throne. Ratchis entered a monastery thereafter. While Ratchis had been more tolerant with the Roman element of the Italian population, Aistulf followed a more aggressive policy of expansion and raids against the Papal States and the Eastern Roman exarchate of Ravenna. In 750, Aistulf captured Ravenna and all the provinces subject to the Exarchate, even declaring himself king of the Romans. He also held court in the former palace of the Exarch, where historian Peter Brown asserts, that as a good western Catholic, Aistulf likely offered gifts \\"on the altar of San Vitale.\\" With the Lombard king close, Rome was under threat and if the city and its Patriarch were to survive, Brown adds, \\"they had to look for new protectors.\\" Recognizing the religious authority of Pope Stephen II, Aistulf offered peace to the pontiff but under Lombard hegemony. In the late spring or summer 751, Aistulf placed Spoleto under his direct control without naming a replacement duke. Having declared himself the new king of the Romans, Aistulf believed that the empire's former supremacy in Italy was now extinct; as a result, the Roman Pope Stephen was unable to exercise the same pastoral diplomacy that his predecessor, Pope Zachary, had over both Luitprand and Ratchis. At Ravenna, Aistulf demanded tribute from the Roman duchy itself, straining papal coffers and greatly worrying Pope Stephen enough that he began negotiations with the Franks. Aistulf's demands were causing consternation in Rome. In 753, Pope Stephen II crossed the Alps and wintered with the Franks, again petitioning them for assistance against Aistulf's Lombards. Returning from a summer campaign against the Saxons, the Frankish leader, Pepin the Short, learned that the pontiff‚Äîaccompanied by a large following and bearing gifts‚Äîwas traveling north to meet with him. While Pope Stephen's arrival in Francia was noteworthy, it was near concomitant with that of Pepin's brother, Carloman, who had incidentally come to Francia under pressure from the Lombard king, Aistulf, to explicitly dissuade Pepin from entering Italy. Carloman's effort to deter his brother from pursuing Aistulf proved unsuccessful and Pepin, who was accompanied by Pope Stephen, left Francia for Italy during the summer of 754; the ailing Carloman joined them on their journey but died on the way. Pope Stephen had further ingratiated Pepin to his cause by bestowing the title \\"Patrician of the Romans\\" onto him and his son, which proved sufficient to elicit Frankish aide and opposition to Aistulf's claims of sovereignty over the Roman empire. Pepin then sent demands to Aistulf for him submit to the patrimony of St. Peter, which meant relinquishing his gains; the Lombard king refused Pepin's demands, thus beginning a Frankish military incursion into Italy. In the spring of 755, the newly anointed Pepin crossed the Alps at the head of his army, putting the Lombards to flight and forcing Aistulf's hand in returning papal lands and those belonging to the wider Roman res publica that he had occupied. While a treaty was signed between Aistulf and Pepin after the Franks laid siege to Pavia, which included the return of Roman lands and a lasting peace, Aistulf was not long in breaking the treaty once Pepin left Italy. After the Frankish army was back across the Alps, Aistulf besieged Rome again in 756, engendering another plea from the papacy. It read: > I, the Apostle Peter...who adopted you as my sons...and who chose you Franks > above all other peoples...I hereby urge and exhort you...to protect my > flock...defend Rome, and your brothers the Romans, from the heinous > Lombards!...Come, come, in the name of the one living and true God, I > beseech you, come and help before the spring of life from which you drink > and in which you are reborn dries up, before the last spark of the sacred > flame which illuminates you dies out, and before your spiritual mother, > God‚Äôs holy Church...is desecrated.\\" Once he heard the anxious pleas from the pope, Pepin marched his Frankish army back into Italy, again defeated the Lombards and forced Aistulf to surrender, but this time the Franks directly supervised the land returns. In the midst of these negotiations, a Byzantine ambassador was sent to Pepin with imperial claims over the liberated provinces‚Äîpart of an attempt to substitute Lombard suzerainty for Byzantine domination‚Äîbut Pepin refused such offers, allowing the Roman West to retain some autonomy as the Frankish king thought only of the Papacy. Meanwhile, Pepin imposed an annual tribute be paid by the Lombards to the Franks, which historian Paolo Delogu labels nothing less than \\"political subjection.\\" Despite this blow to Aistulf's prestige, the Lombard kingdom remained more or less intact and as Delogu observes, \\"the political and military alliance between the Franks and the papacy was not solid enough to allow the latter to act very effectively against the Lombards.\\" When Aistulf died in 756‚Äîkilled during a hunting accident‚Äîhis succession was not without controversy when the ex-king Ratchis emerged from his monastery with the intention to reascend to the throne, but the ambitious Desiderius (duke of Tuscany), gained both Frankish and papal support and replaced Aistulf as king of the Lombards in March 757.

Each red dot represents one Republican member of the House, and each blue dot one Democrat. Multidimensional scaling (MDS) is a means of visualizing the level of similarity of individual cases of a dataset. MDS is used to translate \\"information about the pairwise 'distances' among a set of n objects or individuals\\" into a configuration of n points mapped into an abstract Cartesian space. More technically, MDS refers to a set of related ordination techniques used in information visualization, in particular to display the information contained in a distance matrix. It is a form of non-linear dimensionality reduction. Given a distance matrix with the distances between each pair of objects in a set, and a chosen number of dimensions, N, an MDS algorithm places each object into N-dimensional space such that the between- object distances are preserved as well as possible. For N=1, 2, and 3, the resulting points can be visualized on a scatter plot. Core theoretical contributions to MDS were made by James O. Ramsay of McGill University, who is also regarded as the father of functional data analysis. Types MDS algorithms fall into a taxonomy, depending on the meaning of the input matrix: =Classical multidimensional scaling= It is also known as Principal Coordinates Analysis (PCoA), Torgerson Scaling or Torgerson‚ÄìGower scaling. It takes an input matrix giving dissimilarities between pairs of items and outputs a coordinate matrix whose configuration minimizes a loss function called strain. For example, given the aerial distances between many cities in a matrix D=[d_{ij}], where d_{ij} is the distance between the coordinates of i^{th} and j^{th} city, given by d_{ij}=\\\\sqrt{(x_i-x_j)^2+(y_i-y_j)^2}, you want to find the coordinates of the cities. This problem is addressed in classical MDS. General forms of loss functions called Stress in distance MDS and Strain in classical MDS. The strain is given by: \\\\text{Strain}_D(x_1,x_2,...,x_N)=\\\\Biggl(\\\\frac{ \\\\sum_{i,j} \\\\bigl( b_{ij} - \\\\langle x_i,x_j\\\\rangle \\\\bigr)^2}{\\\\sum_{i,j}b_{ij}^2} \\\\Biggr)^{1/2}, where b_{ij} are the terms of the matrix B defined on step 2 of the following algorithm. : Steps of a Classical MDS algorithm: : Classical MDS uses the fact that the coordinate matrix X can be derived by eigenvalue decomposition from B=XX'. And the matrix B can be computed from proximity matrix D by using double centering.Wickelmaier, Florian. \\"An introduction to MDS.\\" Sound Quality Research Unit, Aalborg University, Denmark (2003): 46 :# Set up the squared proximity matrix D^{(2)}=[d_{ij}^2] :# Apply double centering: B=-\\\\frac{1}{2}JD^{(2)}J using the centering matrix J=I-\\\\frac{1}{n}11', where n is the number of objects. :# Determine the m largest eigenvalues \\\\lambda_1,\\\\lambda_2,...,\\\\lambda_m and corresponding eigenvectors e_1,e_2,...,e_m of B (where m is the number of dimensions desired for the output). :# Now, X=E_m\\\\Lambda_m^{1/2} , where E_m is the matrix of m eigenvectors and \\\\Lambda_m is the diagonal matrix of m eigenvalues of B. :Classical MDS assumes Euclidean distances. So this is not applicable for direct dissimilarity ratings. [ Should indicate how Strain is minimized - Frobenius Distance? ] = Metric multidimensional scaling (mMDS) = It is a superset of classical MDS that generalizes the optimization procedure to a variety of loss functions and input matrices of known distances with weights and so on. A useful loss function in this context is called stress, which is often minimized using a procedure called stress majorization. Metric MDS minimizes the cost function called ‚ÄúStress‚Äù which is a residual sum of squares: > \\\\text{Stress}_D(x_1,x_2,...,x_N)=\\\\Biggl(\\\\sum_{i e > j=1,...,N}\\\\bigl(d_{ij}-\\\\x_i-x_j\\\\\\\\bigr)^2\\\\Biggr)^{1/2} : or, \\\\text{Stress}_D(x_1,x_2,...,x_N)=\\\\Biggl(\\\\frac{\\\\sum_{i,j}\\\\bigl(d_{ij}-\\\\x_i- x_j\\\\\\\\bigr)^2}{\\\\sum_{i,j}d_{ij}^2}\\\\Biggr)^{1/2} : Metric scaling uses a power transformation with a user-controlled exponent p: d_{ij}^p and -d_{ij}^{2p} for distance. In classical scaling p=1. Non-metric scaling is defined by the use of isotonic regression to nonparametrically estimate a transformation of the dissimilarities. [ Confusing notation: d_{ij} was previously defined in terms of x_{i}and x_{j}, according to which the numerator above would be 0. Needs clarification. ] =Non-metric multidimensional scaling (nMDS)= In contrast to metric MDS, non-metric MDS finds both a non-parametric monotonic relationship between the dissimilarities in the item-item matrix and the Euclidean distances between items, and the location of each item in the low- dimensional space. The relationship is typically found using isotonic regression: let x denote the vector of proximities, f(x) a monotonic transformation of x, and d the point distances; then coordinates have to be found, that minimize the so-called stress, : > \\\\text{Stress}=\\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{\\\\sum\\\\bigl(f(x)-d\\\\bigr)^2}{\\\\sum d^2}} : A few variants of this cost function exist. MDS programs automatically minimize stress in order to obtain the MDS solution. : The core of a non- metric MDS algorithm is a twofold optimization process. First the optimal monotonic transformation of the proximities has to be found. Secondly, the points of a configuration have to be optimally arranged, so that their distances match the scaled proximities as closely as possible. The basic steps in a non-metric MDS algorithm are: :# Find a random configuration of points, e. g. by sampling from a normal distribution. :# Calculate the distances d between the points. :# Find the optimal monotonic transformation of the proximities, in order to obtain optimally scaled data f(x). :# Minimize the stress between the optimally scaled data and the distances by finding a new configuration of points. :# Compare the stress to some criterion. If the stress is small enough then exit the algorithm else return to 2. Louis Guttman's smallest space analysis (SSA) is an example of a non-metric MDS procedure. =Generalized multidimensional scaling (GMD)= An extension of metric multidimensional scaling, in which the target space is an arbitrary smooth non-Euclidean space. In cases where the dissimilarities are distances on a surface and the target space is another surface, GMDS allows finding the minimum-distortion embedding of one surface into another. Details The data to be analyzed is a collection of M objects (colors, faces, stocks, . . .) on which a distance function is defined, :d_{i,j} := distance between i-th and j-th objects. These distances are the entries of the dissimilarity matrix : D := \\\\begin{pmatrix} d_{1,1} & d_{1,2} & \\\\cdots & d_{1,M} \\\\\\\\\\\\ d_{2,1} & d_{2,2} & \\\\cdots & d_{2,M} \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\vdots & \\\\vdots & & \\\\vdots \\\\\\\\\\\\ d_{M,1} & d_{M,2} & \\\\cdots & d_{M,M} \\\\end{pmatrix}. The goal of MDS is, given D, to find M vectors x_1,\\\\ldots,x_M \\\\in \\\\mathbb{R}^N such that :\\\\x_i - x_j\\\\ \\\\approx d_{i,j} for all i,j\\\\in {1,\\\\dots,M}, where \\\\\\\\cdot\\\\ is a vector norm. In classical MDS, this norm is the Euclidean distance, but, in a broader sense, it may be a metric or arbitrary distance function.Kruskal, J. B., and Wish, M. (1978), Multidimensional Scaling, Sage University Paper series on Quantitative Application in the Social Sciences, 07-011. Beverly Hills and London: Sage Publications. In other words, MDS attempts to find a mapping from the M objects into \\\\mathbb{R}^N such that distances are preserved. If the dimension N is chosen to be 2 or 3, we may plot the vectors x_i to obtain a visualization of the similarities between the M objects. Note that the vectors x_i are not unique: With the Euclidean distance, they may be arbitrarily translated, rotated, and reflected, since these transformations do not change the pairwise distances \\\\x_i - x_j\\\\. (Note: The symbol \\\\mathbb{R} indicates the set of real numbers, and the notation \\\\mathbb{R}^N refers to the Cartesian product of N copies of \\\\mathbb{R}, which is an N-dimensional vector space over the field of the real numbers.) There are various approaches to determining the vectors x_i. Usually, MDS is formulated as an optimization problem, where (x_1,\\\\ldots,x_M) is found as a minimizer of some cost function, for example, : \\\\min_{x_1,\\\\ldots,x_M} \\\\sum_{i A solution may then be found by numerical optimization techniques. For some particularly chosen cost functions, minimizers can be stated analytically in terms of matrix eigendecompositions. Procedure There are several steps in conducting MDS research: # Formulating the problem ‚Äì What variables do you want to compare? How many variables do you want to compare? What purpose is the study to be used for? # Obtaining input data ‚Äì For example, :- Respondents are asked a series of questions. For each product pair, they are asked to rate similarity (usually on a 7-point Likert scale from very similar to very dissimilar). The first question could be for Coke/Pepsi for example, the next for Coke/Hires rootbeer, the next for Pepsi/Dr Pepper, the next for Dr Pepper/Hires rootbeer, etc. The number of questions is a function of the number of brands and can be calculated as Q = N (N - 1) / 2 where Q is the number of questions and N is the number of brands. This approach is referred to as the ‚ÄúPerception data : direct approach‚Äù. There are two other approaches. There is the ‚ÄúPerception data : derived approach‚Äù in which products are decomposed into attributes that are rated on a semantic differential scale. The other is the ‚ÄúPreference data approach‚Äù in which respondents are asked their preference rather than similarity. # Running the MDS statistical program ‚Äì Software for running the procedure is available in many statistical software packages. Often there is a choice between Metric MDS (which deals with interval or ratio level data), and Nonmetric MDS (which deals with ordinal data). # Decide number of dimensions ‚Äì The researcher must decide on the number of dimensions they want the computer to create. Interpretability of the MDS solution is often important, and lower dimensional solutions will typically be easier to interpret and visualize. However, dimension selection is also an issue of balancing underfitting and overfitting. Lower dimensional solutions may underfit by leaving out important dimensions of the dissimilarity data. Higher dimensional solutions may overfit to noise in the dissimilarity measurements. Model selection tools like AIC/BIC, Bayes factors, or cross-validation can thus be useful to select the dimensionality that balances underfitting and overfitting. # Mapping the results and defining the dimensions ‚Äì The statistical program (or a related module) will map the results. The map will plot each product (usually in two- dimensional space). The proximity of products to each other indicate either how similar they are or how preferred they are, depending on which approach was used. How the dimensions of the embedding actually correspond to dimensions of system behavior, however, are not necessarily obvious. Here, a subjective judgment about the correspondence can be made (see perceptual mapping). # Test the results for reliability and validity ‚Äì Compute R-squared to determine what proportion of variance of the scaled data can be accounted for by the MDS procedure. An R-square of 0.6 is considered the minimum acceptable level. An R-square of 0.8 is considered good for metric scaling and .9 is considered good for non-metric scaling. Other possible tests are Kruskal‚Äôs Stress, split data tests, data stability tests (i.e., eliminating one brand), and test-retest reliability. # Report the results comprehensively ‚Äì Along with the mapping, at least distance measure (e.g., Sorenson index, Jaccard index) and reliability (e.g., stress value) should be given. It is also very advisable to give the algorithm (e.g., Kruskal, Mather), which is often defined by the program used (sometimes replacing the algorithm report), if you have given a start configuration or had a random choice, the number of runs, the assessment of dimensionality, the Monte Carlo method results, the number of iterations, the assessment of stability, and the proportional variance of each axis (r-square).

This work initially took the form of campaigns against violations of human rights and the documentation of evidence of torture by volunteer health professionals and senior medical specialists as a reaction . In 1985, under the leadership of Helen Bamber, the organisation was established as a registered charity. It provided medical treatment, counselling and therapy to torture survivors and documented evidence of torture using the Istanbul Protocol. Sponsorship came from the heads of the Royal College of Physicians, Royal College of Psychiatrists and Royal College of Surgeons of England. It worked at first in two rooms in the former National Temperance Hospital, off Hampstead Road in north-west London.Freedom from Torture history: http://www.freedomfromtorture.org/about/33 By 1990, the organisation was treating 750 clients and then moved to a building in Grafton Road, Kentish Town. The organisation began a regional programme Freedom from Torture's Regional Program http://www.freedomfromtorture.org/about/15 in late 2003 with the opening of a centre in Manchester, treating clients living in the north-west. This followed the Government's Dispersal scheme, which saw asylum seekers relocated outside London. In 2004, the London headquarters moved into a ¬£5.8m treatment centre in Isledon Road, Finsbury Park. The building was purpose-built by architect Paul Hyett. Freedom from Torture‚Äôs Scotland centre opened in Glasgow in 2004, followed by the Newcastle centre in 2006 and the Birmingham centre in 2009. These regional centres were opened to treat torture survivors who had been dispersed outside London.\\"The Integration of Refugees - Positive Practice for Health Professionals\\", Home Office National Refugee Integration website , accessed 12 February 2011 Freedom from Torture's chief executive is Sonya Sceats.https://www.freedomfromtorture.org/news- blogs/15_03_2018/sonya_sceats_is_appointed_chief_executive_of_freedom_from_torture  Treatment provided  Freedom from Torture provides a range of services for its clients. These include medical consultation, examination and forensic documentation of injuries through medico-legal reports, psychological and physical treatment and support, and practical help. The organisation employs over 156 staff and 140 volunteers across its five centres in London, Birmingham, Manchester, Newcastle and Glasgow. These include medical doctors, caseworkers, counsellors, legal advisers, physiotherapists, psychotherapists, psychologists, interpreters, child and family therapists and group workers.  Statistics  Since the organisation was founded in 1985, the organisation has received over 57,000 referrals. In 2016, Freedom from Torture‚Äôs five centres received 1,066 referrals for individuals from 76 different countries. The highest number of referrals came from Sri Lanka (230), Iran (140), Afghanistan (108), Nigeria (64), Democratic Republic of Congo (62), Turkey (56), Iraq (55), Pakistan (53), Syria (48) and Sudan (46). 99% of Freedom from Torture clients are asylum seekers or refugees, who have fled torture and persecution usually in their home countries.  Medico-Legal reports  The organisation's Medico Legal Report Service accepts referrals from torture survivors, their friends and family, GPs, solicitors, refugee community organisations or any other voluntary or statutory sector body. Medico-legal reports provide detailed evidence of the extent of a torture survivor‚Äôs injuries and trauma. Freedom from Torture's team of clinical staff apply international standards for documenting torture in these assessments.  Funding  Freedom from Torture is an independent registered charity. According to the organization's Annual Report 2015, they rely on donations from individuals for almost three quarters of their funding. They raise income using a variety of methods and from a variety of sources.

As the first Chief of the Prussian General Staff, he was noted for his military theories, his reforms of the Prussian army, and his leadership during the Napoleonic Wars. Scharnhorst limited the use of corporal punishments, established promotion for merit, abolished the enrollment of foreigners, began the organization of a reserve army, and organized and simplified the military administration. Biography Born at Bordenau (now a part of Neustadt am R√ºbenberge, Lower Saxony) near Hanover, into a small landowner's family, Waitz von Scharnhorst succeeded in educating himself and in securing admission to the military academy of William, Count of Schaumburg-Lippe, at the Wilhelmstein fortress. In 1778 he received a commission into the Hanoverian service. He employed the intervals of regimental duty in further self-education and literary work. In 1783 he transferred to the artillery and received an appointment to the new artillery school in Hanover. He had already founded a military journal which, under a series of names, endured until 1805, and in 1788 he designed, and in part published, a Handbook for Officers in the Applied Sections of Military Science (Handbuch f√ºr Offiziere in den anwendbaren Teilen der Kriegswissenschaften). He also published in 1792 his Military Handbook for Use in the Field (Milit√§risches Taschenbuch f√ºr den Gebrauch im Felde). Scharnhorst's grave at the Invalidenfriedhof, Berlin The income he derived from his writings provided Scharnhorst's chief means of support, for he still held the rank of lieutenant, and though the farm of Bordenau produced a small sum annually, he had a wife, Clara Schmalz (a sister of Theodor Schmalz, the first director of Berlin University) and family to maintain. His first military campaign took place in 1793 in the Netherlands, in which he served with distinction under the Duke of York. In 1794 he took part in the defence of Menen and commemorated the escape of the garrison in his Defence of the Town of Menen (Verteidigung der Stadt Menin, Hanover, 1803), which, apart from his paper on \\"The Origins of the Good Fortune of the French in the Revolutionary War\\" (Die Ursachen des Gl√ºcks der Franzosen im Revolutionskrieg) remains his best-known work. Shortly thereafter he received promotion to the rank of major and joined the staff of the Hanoverian contingent. After the Peace of Basel (5 March 1795) Scharnhorst returned to Hanover. He had by now become so well known to the armies of the various allied states that he received invitations from several of them to transfer his services. This in the end led to his engaging himself to King Frederick William III of Prussia, who gave him a patent of nobility, the rank of lieutenant-colonel and more than twice the pay that he had received in Hanover (1801). The Prussian Military Academy employed him, almost as a matter of course, in important instructional work (Clausewitz was one of his students) and he founded the Berlin Military Society. In the mobilizations and precautionary measures that marked the years 1804 and 1805, and in the war of 1806 that ensued, Scharnhorst served as chief of the general staff (lieutenant-quartermaster) of the Duke of Brunswick, received a slight wound at Auerstedt (14 October 1806) and distinguished himself by his stern resolution during the retreat of the Prussian army. He attached himself to Bl√ºcher in the last stages of the disastrous campaign, went into captivity with him at the capitulation of Ratekau (7 November 1806), and, quickly exchanged, had a prominent and almost decisive part in leading L'Estocq's Prussian corps, which served with the Russians. For his services at Eylau (February 1807) he received the highest Prussian military order Pour le M√©rite. It was apparent that Scharnhorst's skills exceeded those of a merely brilliant staff officer. Educated in the traditions of the Seven Years' War, he had by degrees, as his experience widened, divested his mind of antiquated forms of war, and realised that only a \\"national\\" army and a policy of fighting decisive battles could give an adequate response to the political and strategic situation brought about by the French Revolution. He was promoted to major-general a few days after the Peace of Tilsit (July 1807), and became the head of a reform commission that included the best of the younger officers, such as Gneisenau, Grolman, and Boyen. Stein himself became a member of the commission and secured Scharnhorst free access to King Frederick William III by securing his appointment as aide- de-camp-general. But Napoleon quickly became suspicious, and Frederick William repeatedly had to suspend or cancel the reforms recommended. By slow and labored steps, Scharnhorst converted the professional long-service army of Prussia, wrecked at Jena (1806), into a national army based on universal service. Universal service was not secured until his death, but he laid down the principles and prepared the way for its adoption. Enrollments of foreigners were abolished, corporal punishments were limited to flagrant cases of insubordination, promotion for merit was established, and the military administration organized and simplified. The organization of the Landwehr (army reserves) was begun. Statue of Scharnhorst on the Unter den Linden, Berlin In 1809, the war between France and Austria roused premature hopes in the patriots' party, which the conqueror did not fail to note. By direct application to Napoleon, Scharnhorst evaded the decree of 26 September 1810, which required all foreigners to leave the Prussian service forthwith, but when in 1811‚Äì1812 France forced Prussia into an alliance against Russia and Prussia despatched an auxiliary army to serve under Napoleon's orders, Scharnhorst left Berlin on unlimited leave of absence. In retirement he wrote and published a work on firearms, √úber die Wirkung des Feuergewehrs (1813). But the retreat from Moscow (1812) at last sounded the call to arms for the new national army of Prussia. Scharnhorst, recalled to the king's headquarters, refused a higher post but became Chief of Staff to Bl√ºcher, in whose vigour, energy, and influence with the young soldiers he had complete confidence. Russian Prince Wittgenstein was so impressed by Scharnhorst that he asked to borrow him temporarily as his Chief of Staff, and Bl√ºcher agreed. In the first battle, L√ºtzen or Gross-G√∂rschen (2 May 1813), Prussia suffered defeat, but a very different defeat from those Napoleon had hitherto customarily inflicted. The French suffered significant casualties and, due in part to a severe shortage of cavalry, failed to follow up, rendering it an incomplete triumph. In this battle, Scharnhorst received a wound in the foot, not in itself grave, but soon made mortal by the fatigues of the retreat to Dresden, and he succumbed to it on 28 June 1813 at Prague, where he had travelled to negotiate with Schwarzenberg and Radetzky for the armed intervention of Austria. Shortly before his death he had received promotion to the rank of lieutenant-general. Frederick William III erected a statue in his memory, by Christian Daniel Rauch, in Berlin. Scharnhorst was buried at the Invalidenfriedhof Cemetery in Berlin.  Legacy  Scharnhorst became the namesake for several objects, places and groups: * SMS Scharnhorst, a 1906 German armored cruiser during World War I. * Scharnhorst, a 1936 German battleship during World War II and lead ship of the Scharnhorst class, which also included the Gneisenau. * Infantry Division Scharnhorst, a 1945 German infantry division and one of the last new Wehrmacht formations of World War II. * Scharnhorst (F 213), a 1943 British sloop, initially known as HMS Mermaid, transferred to West Germany in 1959. * Many streets in German cities, including Berlin, Hamburg, Munich, and Cologne, among others. General Hans von Seeckt has been compared to Scharnhorst, mainly for his part in preparing the German Army of the Weimar Republic, which was severely limited by the Treaty of Versailles, for its eventual rearming, adapting secret doctrines, and preparing a General Staff. He has been credited with their unparalleled success in the campaigns of 1939-1940. After the rise of the Nazis in Germany, Field Marshal von Mackensen compared von Seeckt to Scharnhorst, saying \\"The old fire burnt still, and the Allied Control had not destroyed any of the lasting elements of German strength.\\" Winston Churchill also subscribed to this theory, believing von Seeckt was vital in the return of Germany to its place in the military world as rapidly as it had.Churchill, Winston S.

A sequel to their 1974 work The Mote in God's Eye, The Gripping Hand is, chronologically, the last novel to be set in the CoDominium universe (though in 2010, Pournelle's daughter released an authorized sequel). In the United Kingdom, it was released as The Moat around Murcheson's Eye (sometimes misspelled \\"The Mote around Murchison's Eye\\"). The Gripping Hand is set in the year 3042 (twenty-five years after the events of The Mote in God's Eye) and revolves primarily around two characters of the first book, Captain Sir Kevin Renner (ISN, Reserve) and His Excellency Horace Bury, Imperial Trader Magnate. It also resolves many of the conflicts and tension remaining from the preceding novel, but much of the plot cannot be understood without reading The Mote in God's Eye. A crucial plot element of the book is the idiom \\"on the gripping hand\\" (OTGH), a three-armed variation of the idiom \\"on the other hand\\" similar in meaning to \\"on the third hand\\", but with the added sense that the third-mentioned consideration is the most important one. The saying is native to the alien Moties, who have three arms, one of which is stronger but possesses less finesse. The idiom has also gained some use among fans of the book.Jargon File entry for \\"On the gripping hand\\" Plot At the end of The Mote in God's Eye, Renner and Bury are secretly enlisted into Imperial Naval Intelligence. They spend the next twenty-five years preventing rebellions against the Empire so that the Imperial Navy can concentrate on blockading the Moties in their star system. While investigating suspicious economic activity on the planet Maxroy's Purchase, Renner and Bury encounter wide idiomatic usage of the phrase \\"...on the gripping hand\\". While the source of the phrase turns out to be innocuous enough -- the governor picked up the expression as a crewman on INSS MacArthur on the expedition to Mote Prime -- the memories dredged up are too much for Bury. Driven by nightmares and a deep-seated fear for humanity's safety, Bury must confirm that the Empire is safe from the Moties. Renner and Bury travel to Sparta, the Imperial capital planet, to obtain permission to inspect the blockade. In Mote, it is mentioned that a protostar is forming in the Coalsack Nebula. The Moties had studied it extensively and told the MacArthur expedition that it would ignite in about 1,000 years. Bury and Renner inadvertently discover, much to their horror, that the estimate was deliberately falsified: the object is due to collapse and ignite much sooner. The newborn star will create one or more new Alderson Points for interstellar travel, giving the Moties at least one more exit from their system. The sole currently existing Alderson Point leads to the photosphere of the supergiant red star Murcheson's Eye, which made the blockade much more practical. Armed with this alarming knowledge and carrying influential passengers, Renner and Bury depart aboard Bury's ship Sinbad for New Caledonia, the closest human system to the Mote. There the Imperial Commission decides that ships must be sent to the hitherto ignored star system where the only dangerous Alderson Point will appear. All that can be sent on such short notice are two Imperial warships and Sinbad. They arrive ‚Äî just in time to observe seven Motie ships emerge from the new Alderson Point. The second half of The Gripping Hand is a tale of shifting alliances, diplomacy and space combat involving the many Motie factions and the Empire, as represented by Bury and Renner. With the aid of the grownup offspring of Lord and Lady Blaine, and a key piece of genetic engineering, Bury and Renner fight to save the Empire by enabling the Moties to biologically incorporate into it peacefully. In the end, the Motie alliance in favor of peaceful co- existence with humans defeats the one determined to expand at any cost. Key to this is a genetically altered parasite that can limit the excessive reproduction rate that had previously condemned the Moties to cycles of uncontrollable expansion, followed inevitably by war and the collapse of civilization.

Journal of the History of Biology 41(4):677‚Äì716  Biography  Coenraad Jacob Temminck was born on 31 March 1778 in Amsterdam in the Dutch Republic. From his father, Jacob Temminck, who was treasurer of the Dutch East India Company with links to numerous travellers and collectors, he inherited a large collection of bird specimens. His father was a good friend of Francois Levaillant who also guided Coenraad. Temminck's Manuel d'ornithologie, ou Tableau syst√©matique des oiseaux qui se trouvent en Europe (1815) was the standard work on European birds for many years. He was also the author of Histoire naturelle g√©n√©rale des Pigeons et des Gallinac√©es (1813‚Äì1817), Nouveau Recueil de Planches colori√©es d'Oiseaux (1820‚Äì1839), and contributed to the mammalian sections of Philipp Franz von Siebold's Fauna japonica (1844‚Äì1850). Temminck was the first director of the National Museum of Natural History in Leiden from 1820 until his death. In 1831, he was elected a foreign member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences. In 1836 he became member of the Royal Institute, predecessor of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences. Temminck died on 30 January 1858, at the age of 79, in Leiden, Netherlands.  Works  Temminck, in collaboration with Heinrich Kuhl, is the author of descriptions of parrots, including the rosella Platycercus icterotis. A tailless mutant of a junglefowl Gallus lafayettii was described in 1807 by Temminck, which in 1868 the English naturalist Charles Darwin incorrectly denied existed.Grouw, Hein van, Dekkers, Wim & Rookmaaker, Kees (2017).

Under his management, WorldCom grew rapidly but collapsed in 2002 amid revelations of accounting irregularities, making it at the time one of the largest accounting scandals in the United States. Ebbers blamed his subordinates but was convicted of fraud and conspiracy. In December 2019, Ebbers was released from Federal Medical Center, Fort Worth due to declining health, having served 13 years of his 25-year sentence, and he died just over a month later. In 2013, Portfolio.com and CNBC named Ebbers as the 5th-worst CEO in American history. In 2009, Time named him the 10th most corrupt CEO of all time. Dubbed the \\"Telecom Cowboy,\\" Ebbers often wore boots and blue jeans instead of the typical corporate uniform of a suit and tie. He also lived on a farm and loved to drive a tractor. Early life and education Ebbers was born in Edmonton, Alberta, the second of five children of Kathleen and John Ebbers, a traveling salesman. His family were devout Christians. When Ebbers was young, the family lived in California and they lived for a while on a mission post on a Navajo Nation Indian reservation in New Mexico before moving back to Canada when Ebbers was a teenager. After high school, Ebbers briefly attended the University of Alberta and Calvin College before enrolling at Mississippi College on a basketball scholarship. Between schools, he worked as a milkman and bouncer. An injury before his senior season prevented him from playing his final year and he was instead assigned to coach the junior varsity team. In 1967, he received a Bachelor's degree in physical education, with an academic minor in secondary education, from Mississippi College. Career Ebbers began his business career operating a chain of motels in Mississippi. In 1983, in a coffee shop in Hattiesburg, Mississippi, he and 3 other investors formed Long Distance Discount Services, Inc. and in 1985, he was named chief executive officer. The company acquired over 60 telecommunications firms and in 1995, it changed its name to WorldCom. In 1996, WorldCom acquired MFS Communications (originally Metropolitan Fiber Systems) and in September 1998, it acquired MCI Communications. In July 2000, it abandoned its planned $115 billion acquisition of Sprint Corporation after U.S. and European Union antitrust regulators raised objections. Between September 2000 and April 2002, the board of directors of Worldcom authorized several loans and loan guarantees to Ebbers so that he would not have to sell his Worldcom shares to meet margin calls as the share price plummeted during the bursting of the dot- com bubble. By April 2002, Ebbers had lost substantial support on the board due to these loans. Additionally, a number of directors believed Ebbers had not charted a way forward after the Sprint merger collapsed. On April 26, Worldcom's board voted unanimously to demand Ebbers' resignation. Ebbers formally resigned on April 30, 2002. As part of his departure, Ebbers's loans were consolidated into a single $408.2 million promissory note. In 2003, Ebbers defaulted on the note and Worldcom foreclosed on many of his assets. =Awards and accolades= * Mississippi Business Hall of Fame (May 1995) * Member of Wired 25 (November 1998) * 25 most powerful people in networking by Network World (January 4, 1999) * Time Digital 50 (1999) * Honorary Doctor of Laws, Mississippi College (1992) * Honorary doctorate, Tougaloo College (1998) Fraud On June 25, 2002, WorldCom admitted to nearly $3.9 billion in accounting misstatements and on July 22, 2002, it filed bankruptcy. The figure eventually grew to $11 billion. This initiated a series of investigations and legal proceedings, which focused on Ebbers, WorldCom's former CEO. Ebbers blamed the accounting scandal on his subordinates. =Congressional hearing= In response to a subpoena, Ebbers appeared before the U.S. House Committee on Financial Services on July 8, 2002. At these hearings, Ebbers stated \\"I do not believe I have anything to hide, I believe that no one will conclude that I engaged in any criminal or fraudulent conduct.\\" After making this statement, Ebbers asserted his right against self-incrimination per the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution. Ebbers's statement constituted testimony that could not undergo cross-examination and Ebbers was threatened with Contempt of Congress charges, although no charges were filed. =Criminal charges and verdict= On August 27, 2003, Attorney General of Oklahoma Drew Edmondson filed a 15-count indictment against Ebbers. The indictment charged that he violated securities laws by defrauding investors on multiple occasions between January 2001 and March 2002. On November 20, 2003, the charges by Oklahoma were dropped, with the right to refile retained, to defer to federal charges. On March 2, 2004, federal authorities indicted Ebbers with security fraud and conspiracy charges. On May 25, 2004 federal prosecutors increased the list of charges to 9 felonies: 1 count each of conspiracy and securities fraud, and 7 counts of filing false statements with securities regulators. On March 15, 2005, Ebbers was found guilty of all charges. On March 30, 2005, an agreement to extend the statute of limitations on the charges from Oklahoma was signed, allowing Oklahoma prosecutors time to see the results of federal sentencing. =Sentencing and jail time= On July 13, 2005, federal judge Barbara S. Jones, of the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, sentenced Ebbers to 25 years in a federal prison in Louisiana. Ebbers was allowed to remain free for another year while his appeal was being considered. His conviction was upheld in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in July 2006. On September 6, 2006, the presiding judge ordered him to report to jail on September 26 to start serving his 25-year sentence. Ebbers reported to Oakdale Federal Correctional Institution in Oakdale, Louisiana, on September 26, 2006, driving himself to the prison in his Mercedes-Benz vehicle. Ebbers served in the low-security portion of the complex, which typically houses non-violent offenders and is built like a school dormitory. He was granted early release 8 years early, on December 19, 2019, due to health problems. =Civil suits= On October 11, 2002, WorldCom investors brought a class action civil lawsuit against Ebbers and other defendants, alleging injuries as a result of Ebbers's securities fraud violations. Judge Denise Cote of the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York ordered the parties in the lawsuit to negotiate. The parties agreed that Ebbers and his codefendants would distribute over $6.13 billion, plus interest, to over 830,000 individuals and institutions that had held stocks and bonds in WorldCom at the time of its collapse. Ebbers agreed to relinquish almost all of his assets, including a home in Mississippi, and his interests in a lumber company, a marina, a golf course, a hotel, and thousands of acres of forested real estate. After the settlement, Ebbers's wife was left with an estimated $50,000 in known assets. On September 21, 2005, Judge Cote approved the settlement and dismissed the lawsuit against Ebbers. Personal life =Marriages= In 1968, Ebbers married Linda Pigott-Smith, and the couple raised three daughters. Ebbers filed for divorce in July 1997 and married his second wife, Kristie Webb, in the spring of 1999. She filed for divorce on April 16, 2008, less than two years after he entered prison. =Death= Ebbers died at his home in Brookhaven, Mississippi on February 2, 2020 at the age of 78, just over a month after being released from prison due to health issues. His lawyers claimed that he was, by the time of his death, legally blind and suffering from dementia, anemia, and he had lost significant weight. =Personal holdings= At his peak in early 1999, Ebbers was worth an estimated $1.4 billion and listed as 174th on the Forbes 400. His personal holdings included: * Douglas Lake Canada's biggest ranch ‚Äì 500,000 acres (2,000 km¬≤) in British Columbia. General partner/president. Acquired in 1998 for about $65 million. Sold on May 30, 2003, by MCI to E. Stanley Kroenke. * Angelina Plantation ‚Äì 21,000 acres (85 km¬≤) farm in Monterey, Louisiana. Co-owner with brother, John Ebbers. Acquired in 1998. * Joshua Holdings ‚Äì which combined with Joshua Timberlands and Joshua Timber totals 540,000 acres (2,200 km¬≤) of timberlands in Mississippi, Tennessee, Louisiana and Alabama. Majority owner. Acquired properties in 1999 for about $600 million. * Pine Ridge Farm ‚Äì Livestock and crop farm in Mississippi. Owner. LLC formed in 1997. * Columbus Lumber ‚Äì High-tech lumber mill in Brookhaven, Mississippi. Majority owner since at least 1996. * Yachts ‚Äì BCT Holdings, owner of Intermarine, a yacht building and repair company in Georgia. Primary owner. Intermarine acquired in 1998 for about $14 million. * Hotels ‚Äì Nine hotels in Mississippi and Tennessee: Co-owner or owner. Acquired over many years. * Trucking ‚Äì KLLM, a trucking firm in Mississippi. Director. Acquired with partner in 2000 for about $30 million. Was at one point led by K. William Grothe, who was an executive at WorldCom. * Sports ‚Äì Mississippi Indoor Sports/Jackson Bandits, a minor league hockey team. 50% owner. Acquired in 1999. Sold stake in September 2003. =Other activities= From 1993 through 1995, Ebbers served as chairman of the board of directors of the Competitive Telecommunications Association, where he pleaded with the United States Congress to improve competition with the incumbent telecommunications companies. In 1997, he became the chair for Mississippi College's New Dawn Campaign, a $100 million fundraising campaign to improve campus facilities. In July 2001, Ebbers was proposed by George W. Bush as the chair for the President's National Security Telecommunications Advisory Committee. =Religious faith= While CEO of WorldCom, he was a member of the Easthaven Baptist Church in Brookhaven, Mississippi. As a high-profile member of the congregation, Ebbers regularly taught Sunday school and attended the morning church service with his family. His faith was overt, and he often started corporate meetings with prayer. When the allegations of conspiracy and fraud were first brought to light in 2002, Ebbers addressed the congregation and insisted on his innocence. \\"I just want you to know you aren't going to church with a crook,\\" he said. \\"No one will find me to have knowingly committed fraud.\\" References Further reading * - A book by the former chief audit executive of Worldcom on the demise of the company.

Geothermally heated hot springs sometimes produce similar (but less porous) carbonate deposits, which are known as travertine. Tufa is sometimes referred to as (meteogene) travertine. It should not be confused with hot spring (thermogene) travertine. Tufa, which is calcareous, should not be confused with tuff, a porous volcanic rock with a similar etymology that is sometimes also called \\"tufa\\". Classification and features Modern and fossil tufa deposits abound with wetland plants; as such, many tufa deposits are characterised by their large macrobiological component, and are highly porous. Tufa forms either in fluvial channels or in lacustrine environments. Ford and Pedley (1996) provide a review of tufa systems worldwide. Barrage Tufa at Cwm Nash, South Wales =Fluvial deposits= Deposits can be classified by their depositional environment (or otherwise by vegetation or petrographically). Pedley (1990) provides an extensive classification system, which includes the following classes of fluvial tufa: *Spring ‚Äì Deposits form on emergence from a spring/seep. Morphology can vary from mineratrophic wetlands to spring aprons (see calcareous sinter) *Braided channel ‚Äì Deposits form within a fluvial channel, dominated by oncoids (see oncolite) *Cascade ‚Äì Deposits form at waterfalls, deposition is focused here due to accelerated flow (see Geochemistry) *Barrage ‚Äì Deposits form as a series of phytoherm barrages across a channel, which may grow up to several metres in height. Barrages often contain a significant detrital component, composed of organic material (leaf litter, branches etc.). Rubaksa tufa plug, after drying of the river, in Ethiopia =Lacustrine deposits= Lacustrine tufas are generally formed at the periphery of lakes and built-up phytoherms (freshwater reefs), and on stromatolites. Oncoids are also common in these environments. =Other deposits= While fluvial and lacustrine systems make up the bulk of tufa systems worldwide, there are several other important tufa environments. Calcareous sinter Although sometimes regarded as a distinct carbonate deposit, calcareous sinter formed from ambient temperature water can be considered a sub-type of tufa. Speleothems Calcareous speleothems may be regarded as a form of calcareous sinter. They lack any significant macrophyte component due to the absence of light, and for this reason they are often morphologically closer to travertine or calcareous sinter. Tufa at Trona Pinnacles, California Tufa columns Tufa columns are an unusual form of tufa typically associated with saline lakes. They are distinct from most tufa deposits in that they lack any significant macrophyte component, due to the salinity excluding mesophilic organisms. Some tufa columns may actually form from hot-springs, and may therefore constitute a form of travertine. It is generally thought that such features form from CaCO3 precipitated when carbonate rich source waters emerge into alkaline soda lakes. They have also been found in marine settings in the Ikka fjord of Greenland where the Ikaite columns can reach up to in height. Biology Tufa deposits form an important habitat for a diverse flora. Bryophytes (mosses, liverworts etc.) and diatoms are well represented. The porosity of the deposits creates a wet habitat ideal for these plants. The Pyramid and Domes tufa rock structures, Pyramid Lake, Nevada Geochemistry Modern tufa is formed from alkaline waters, supersaturated with calcite. On emergence, waters degas CO2 due to the lower atmospheric pCO2 (see partial pressure), resulting in an increase in pH. Since carbonate solubility decreases with increased pH, precipitation is induced. Supersaturation may be enhanced by factors leading to a reduction in pCO2, for example increased air-water interactions at waterfalls may be important, as may photosynthesis. Recently it has been demonstrated that microbially induced precipitation may be more important than physico-chemical precipitation. Pedley et al. (2009) showed with flume experiments that precipitation does not occur unless a biofilm is present, despite supersaturation. Calcite is the dominant mineral precipitate found; however, the polymorph aragonite is also found. Chelekwot, Ethiopia Occurrence Tufa is common in many parts of the world. Some notable deposits include: *Pyramid Lake, Nevada, US ‚Äì tufa formations *Big Soda Lake, Nevada, US ‚Äì tufa formations only a century old *Mono Lake, California, US ‚Äì tufa columns *Trona Pinnacles, California, US ‚Äì tufa columns *Matlock Bath, Derbyshire, United Kingdom *North Dock Tufa, United Kingdom *Plitvice Lakes National Park, Croatia *Basturs Lakes, Pallars Juss√†, Catalonia - tufa mounds *Various parts of Armenia, such as Artik *The southwestern coastline of Western Australia *Near Groot Marico in the North West Province, South Africa *The Kadishi Tufa, Blyde River Canyon, Mpumalanga Province, South Africa Some sources suggest that \\"tufa\\" was used as the primary building material for most of the ch√¢teaux of the Loire Valley, France. This results from a mis-translation of the terms \\"tuffeau jaune\\" and \\"tuffeau blanc\\", which are porous varieties of the Late Cretaceous marine limestone known as chalk. Uses Tufa is today occasionally shaped into a planter. Its porous consistency makes tufa ideal for alpine gardens. A concrete mixture called hypertufa is used for similar purposes.

It is preceded by the Halaf period and the Halaf-Ubaid Transitional period and succeeded by the Late Chalcolithic period. History of research The term \\"Ubaid period\\" was coined at a conference in Baghdad in 1930, where at the same time the Jemdet Nasr and Uruk periods were defined.  Dating, extent and periodization  The Ubaid period is divided into four principal phases: * Ubaid 0, sometimes called Oueili, (6500‚Äì5400 BC), an early Ubaid phase first excavated at Tell el-'Oueili * Ubaid 1, sometimes called Eridu Kurt, Am√©lie Ancient near East V1 (Routledge History of the Ancient World) Routledge (31 Dec 1996) p. 22 corresponding to the city Eridu, (5400‚Äì4700 BC), a phase limited to the extreme south of Iraq, on what was then the shores of the Persian Gulf. This phase, showing clear connection to the Samarra culture to the north, saw the establishment of the first permanent settlement south of the 5 inch rainfall isohyet. These people pioneered the growing of grains in the extreme conditions of aridity, thanks to the high water tables of Southern Iraq.Roux, Georges \\"Ancient Iraq\\" (Penguin, Harmondsworth) * Ubaid 2 (4800‚Äì4500 BC). At that time, Hadji Muhammed style ceramics was produced. This period also saw the development of extensive canal networks near major settlements. Irrigation agriculture, which seems to have developed first at Choga Mami (4700‚Äì4600 BC) and rapidly spread elsewhere, form the first required collective effort and centralised coordination of labour in Mesopotamia.Wittfogel, Karl (1981) \\"Oriental Despotism: A Comparative Study of Total Power (Vintage Books) *Ubaid 3: Tell al‚ÄêUbaid style ceramics. Traditionally, this ceramic period was dated c. 5300‚Äì4700 BC. The appearance of these ceramics received different dates depending on the particular sites, which have a wide geographical distribution. In recent studies, there's a tendency to narrow this period somewhat. *Ubaid 4: Late Ubaid style ceramics, c.4700‚Äì4200 BC.Carter, R. (2010). Pottery from H3. In R. Carter & H.

Samarra, Halaf and Hassuna cultures. Influence to the north Around 5000 BC, the Ubaid culture spread into northern Mesopotamia and was adopted by the Halaf culture. This is known as the Halaf-Ubaid Transitional period of northern Mesopotamia. During the late Ubaid period around 4500‚Äì4000 BC, there was some increase in social polarization, with central houses in the settlements becoming bigger. But there were no real cities until the later Uruk period. Ubaid influence in the Persian Gulf area During the Ubaid 2 and 3 periods (5500‚Äì5000 BC), southern Mesopotamian Ubaid influence is felt further to the south as far as the Persian Gulf. Ubaid artifacts spread also all along the Arabian littoral, showing the growth of a trading system that stretched from the Mediterranean coast through to Oman.Bibby, Geoffrey (2013), \\"Looking for Dilmun\\" (Stacey International)Crawford, Harriet E.W.(1998), \\"Dilmun and its Gulf Neighbours\\" (Cambridge University Press) Spreading from Eridu, the Ubaid culture extended from the Middle of the Tigris and Euphrates to the shores of the Persian Gulf, and then spread down past Bahrain to the copper deposits at Oman. =Obsidian trade= Starting around 5500 BC, Ubaid pottery of periods 2 and 3 has been documented at Sabiyah in Kuwait and in Dosariyah in eastern Saudi Arabia. In Dosariyah, nine samples of Ubaid-associated obsidian were analyzed. They came from eastern and northeastern Anatolia, such as from Pasinler, Erzurum, as well as from Armenia. The obsidian was in the form of finished blade fragments.Lamya Khalidi, Bernard Gratuze, Gil Stein, Augusta Mcmahon, Salam Al-Quntar, et al.. The growth of early social networks: New geochemical results of obsidian from the Ubaid to Chalcolithic Period in Syria, Iraq and the Gulf. Journal of Archaeological Science: Reports, Elsevier, 2016, ‚ü®halshs-01390232‚ü© =Decline of influence= The archaeological record shows that Arabian Bifacial/Ubaid period came to an abrupt end in eastern Arabia and the Oman peninsula at 3800 BC, just after the phase of lake lowering and onset of dune reactivation. At this time, increased aridity led to an end in semi- desert nomadism, and there is no evidence of human presence in the area for approximately 1,000 years, the so-called \\"Dark Millennium\\". That might be due to the 5.9 kiloyear event at the end of the Older Peron. Numerous examples of Ubaid pottery have been found along the Persian Gulf, as far as Dilmun, where Indus Valley Civilization pottery has also been found. Description Large buildings, implying centralized government, started to be made. Eridu Temple, final Ubaid. Ubaid culture is characterized by large unwalled village settlements, multi-roomed rectangular mud-brick houses and the appearance of the first temples of public architecture in Mesopotamia, with a growth of a two tier settlement hierarchy of centralized large sites of more than 10 hectares surrounded by smaller village sites of less than 1 hectare. Domestic equipment included a distinctive fine quality buff or greenish colored pottery decorated with geometric designs in brown or black paint. Tools such as sickles were often made of hard fired clay in the south, while in the north stone and sometimes metal were used. Villages thus contained specialised craftspeople, potters, weavers and metalworkers, although the bulk of the population were agricultural labourers, farmers and seasonal pastoralists. During the Ubaid Period [5000‚Äì4000 BC], the movement towards urbanization began. \\"Agriculture and animal husbandry [domestication] were widely practiced in sedentary communities\\". There were also tribes that practiced domesticating animals as far north as Turkey, and as far south as the Zagros Mountains. The Ubaid period in the south was associated with intensive irrigated hydraulic agriculture, and the use of the plough, both introduced from the north, possibly through the earlier Choga Mami, Hadji Muhammed and Samarra cultures.

Society Northern expansion of the Ubaid culture. Two female figurines with bitumen headdresses, ceramic. Ur, Ubaid 4 period, 4500‚Äì4000 BCE The Ubaid period as a whole, based upon the analysis of grave goods, was one of increasingly polarised social stratification and decreasing egalitarianism. Bogucki describes this as a phase of \\"Trans-egalitarian\\" competitive households, in which some fall behind as a result of downward social mobility. Morton Fried and Elman Service have hypothesised that Ubaid culture saw the rise of an elite class of hereditary chieftains, perhaps heads of kin groups linked in some way to the administration of the temple shrines and their granaries, responsible for mediating intra-group conflict and maintaining social order. It would seem that various collective methods, perhaps instances of what Thorkild Jacobsen called primitive democracy, in which disputes were previously resolved through a council of one's peers, were no longer sufficient for the needs of the local community. Ubaid culture originated in the south, but still has clear connections to earlier cultures in the region of middle Iraq. The appearance of the Ubaid folk has sometimes been linked to the so-called Sumerian problem, related to the origins of Sumerian civilisation. Whatever the ethnic origins of this group, this culture saw for the first time a clear tripartite social division between intensive subsistence peasant farmers, with crops and animals coming from the north, tent-dwelling nomadic pastoralists dependent upon their herds, and hunter- fisher folk of the Arabian littoral, living in reed huts. Stein and √ñzbal describe the Near East oecumene that resulted from Ubaid expansion, contrasting it to the colonial expansionism of the later Uruk period. \\"A contextual analysis comparing different regions shows that the Ubaid expansion took place largely through the peaceful spread of an ideology, leading to the formation of numerous new indigenous identities that appropriated and transformed superficial elements of Ubaid material culture into locally distinct expressions.\\" The earliest evidence for sailing has been found in Kuwait indicating that sailing was known by the Ubaid 3 period.

As a child, he received his education at St. Nessan's Christian Brothers School, and later North Monastery. Mulhare, as a young adult, began schooling at the National University of Ireland in medicine, but eventually decided upon a career in theatre. After acting in various Irish venues including the Gate Theatre in Dublin, he moved to London, where he worked with Orson Welles and John Gielgud. His best-known stage role was as Professor Higgins in the original Broadway production of My Fair Lady, having taken over the role from Rex Harrison in 1957. Television His first television appearance was in 1956 in a production of The Adventures of Robin Hood. He was a guest panelist in 1958 on the CBS television game show What's My Line?What's My Line? ‚Äì Xavier Cugat & Abbe Lane; Edward Mulhare (panel) (26 January 1958) By 1965, he was back in Hollywood appearing in films and television shows.

In The Ghost & Mrs. Muir, a supernatural sitcom that ran from 1968 to 1970, he starred as Captain Daniel Gregg, and again was something of a successor to Rex Harrison, who had originated the role of \\"The Ghost\\" in the original 1947 film. He also guest-starred in \\"Experiment In Terra\\", an episode of the original Battlestar Galactica. Mulhare co-starred as Devon Miles, director of the Foundation for Law and Government, on Knight Rider (1982‚Äì1986), alongside David Hasselhoff's Michael Knight.

Ludwig van Beethoven's \\"Yorckscher Marsch\\" is named in his honor. The Field Marshal's surname is Yorck; Wartenburg is a battle-honour appended to the surname as a title of distinction (cf. Britain's Montgomery of Alamein). Background Yorck's father, David Jonathan von Yorck, was born in Rowe in the Prussian Province of Pomerania (today Rowy, Poland), to Jan Jarka, a Lutheran pastor, whose family came from a small manor in Gross Gustkow (hence the name von Gostkowski) and traced its origins from Pomeranian Kashubians. David Jonathan von Yorck served as a captain (Hauptmann) in the Prussian Army under King Frederick the Great; Yorck's mother Maria Sophia Pflug was the daughter of a Potsdam artisan. Their son Ludwig was born in Potsdam, however, the couple did not marry until 1763. Ludwig's father changed his name from Jark(a) to Yorck to make it look more English (York) and dropped the von Gostkowski. Career Yorck entered the Prussian Army in 1772 and achieved the rank of lieutenant in 1777. After seven years' service, however, he was cashiered for insubordination, having reproached his superior with plundering methods during the War of the Bavarian Succession. He spent one year in the confinement of Fort Friedrichsburg in K√∂nigsberg, whereafter King Frederick the Great denied him his re-employment. Yorck left Prussia and joined the Swiss mercenaries in Dutch service in 1781. He took part in the operations of 1783-84 in the East Indies as captain at Regiment de Meuron. He also took part with the French army in a battle against British troops in Cape Town. Returning to Potsdam in 1786 he was, on the death of Frederick the Great, finally reinstated in his old service by the new king Frederick William II, from 1792 in the rank of major. In 1794/95 he participated in the operations in Poland during the Ko≈õciuszko Uprising, distinguishing himself especially at Szczekociny. From 1799 Yorck began to make a name for himself as commander of a light infantry (J√§ger) regiment, being one of the first to give prominence to the training of skirmishers. In 1805, then with the rank of Oberst, he was appointed to the command of an infantry brigade as a vanguard force of the troops of Duke Karl August of Saxe-Weimar during the War of the Fourth Coalition. In the disastrous Jena campaign he played a conspicuous and successful part as a rearguard commander, especially at Altenzaun. Having made his way across the Elbe river and through the Harz mountains, he was taken prisoner, severely wounded, in the last stand of Bl√ºcher's corps at L√ºbeck. In the reorganization of the Prussian army which followed the 1807 Treaty of Tilsit, Yorck was one of the leading figures. At first major-general commanding the West Prussian brigade, afterwards inspector-general of light infantry, he was finally appointed second in command to General Grawert, the leader of the auxiliary corps which Prussia was compelled to send in support of Napoleon's invasion of Russia. The two generals did not agree, Grawert being an open partisan of the French alliance, and Yorck an ardent patriot, but before long Grawert retired, and Yorck assumed the command. Opposed in his advance on Riga by the Russian General Steingell, Yorck displayed great skill in a series of combats which ended in the retreat of the enemy to Riga. Throughout the campaign he had been the object of many overtures from the enemy's generals, and though he had hitherto rejected them, it was soon borne in upon him that the French Grand Army was doomed. Marshal MacDonald, his immediate French superior, retreated before the corps of Diebitsch, and Yorck found himself isolated. As a soldier his duty was to break through, but as a Prussian patriot his position was more difficult. He had to judge whether the moment was favorable for the war of liberation; and, whatever might be the enthusiasm of his junior staff- officers, Yorck had no illusions as to the safety of his own head. On 20 December the general made up his mind. The Convention of Tauroggen armistice, signed by Diebitsch and Yorck without consent of their king, declared the Prussian corps \\"neutral\\". The news was received with the wildest enthusiasm, but the Prussian Court dared not yet throw off the mask, and an order was despatched suspending Yorck from his command pending a court-martial. Diebitsch refused to let the bearer pass through his lines, and the general was finally absolved when the Treaty of Kalisz placed Prussia on the side of the Allies. Yorck's act was nothing less than the turning-point of Prussian history. His veterans formed the nucleus of the forces of East Prussia, and Yorck himself in public took the final step by declaring war on Napoleon as the commander of those forces. Statue of Yorck von Wartenburg on the Unter den Linden, Berlin. On 17 March 1813, Yorck made his entry into Berlin in the midst of the wildest exuberance of patriotic joy. On the same day the king declared war. During 1813-14 Yorck led his veterans with conspicuous success. He covered Bl√ºcher's retreat after Bautzen and took a decisive part in the battles on the Katzbach. In the advance on Leipzig his corps won the action of Wartenburg (4 October) and took part in the crowning victory in the Battle of the Nations of 18 October. In the campaign in France, Yorck drew off the shattered remnants of Osten-Sacken's corps at Montmirail, and decided the day at Laon. The storming of Paris was Yorck's last fight. In the campaign of 1815 none of the older men were employed in Bl√ºcher's army, in order that August von Gneisenau might be free to assume command in case of the old prince's death. Yorck was appointed to a reserve corps in Prussia, and, feeling that his services were no longer required, he retired from the army. His master would not accept his resignation for a considerable time, and in 1821 made him Generalfeldmarschall. He had been made Graf Yorck von Wartenburg in 1814. The remainder of his life was spent on his estate of Klein-√ñls (today Ole≈õnica Ma≈Ça, Poland) in Silesia, a gift of the king. A statue by Christian Daniel Rauch was erected in Yorck's honor in Berlin in 1855. The former football club Yorck Boyen Insterburg was also named in honor of Yorck. A 1931 film Yorck was made about him with Werner Krauss playing the General. Notable descendants Yorck was the great-grandfather of the late-nineteenth-century philosopher Paul Yorck von Wartenburg and the great-great-great-grandfather of Peter Yorck von Wartenburg, a member of the German resistance during the Nazi regime.

He founded the Berlin school of sculpture, and was the foremost German sculptor of the 19th century. Life Bust of Christian Daniel Rauch by David d'Angers (1834) Rauch was born at Arolsen in the Principality of Waldeck in the Holy Roman Empire. His father was employed at the court of Prince Frederick II of Hesse, and in 1790 the lad was apprenticed to the court sculptor of Arolsen, Friedrich Valentin. In 1795, he became assistant to Johann Christian Ruhl, the court sculptor of Kassel. After the death of his father in 1796 and his older brother in 1797, he moved to Berlin where he was appointed groom of the chamber in the king's household. He abandoned sculpture temporarily, but his new position provided a wider field for improvement, and he soon used the opportunity and practised his art in spare hours. He came under the influence of Johann Gottfried Schadow. In 1802, he exhibited his ‚ÄúSleeping Endymion.‚Äù Queen Louisa of Prussia, surprising him one day in the act of modeling her features in wax, sent him to study at the Prussian Academy of Art. Not long afterwards, in 1804, Count Sandrecky gave Rauch the means to complete his education at Rome, where Wilhelm von Humboldt, Antonio Canova and Bertel Thorvaldsen befriended him. He also executed his life-size bust of Queen Louise in marble, and among his other early works were busts of the poet Zacharias Werner, Count Wenyerski and the painter Raphael Mengs, the latter executed on a commission from Ludwig I of Bavaria. Other works were bas-reliefs of ‚ÄúHippolytus and Phaedra,‚Äù ‚ÄúMars and Venus wounded by Diomede,‚Äù and a ‚ÄúChild praying.‚Äù He remained in Rome for six years. In 1811, Rauch was commissioned to execute a monument for Queen Louisa of Prussia. The statue, representing the queen in a sleeping posture, was placed in a mausoleum in the grounds of Charlottenburg, and procured great fame and a European reputation for the artist. A similar statue of the Queen, even more successful, was placed in the Sanssouci Park at Potsdam. The erection of nearly all public statues came to be entrusted to him. There were, among others, B√ºlow, Yorck and Scharnhorst at Berlin, Bl√ºcher at Breslau, Maximilian at Munich, Francke at Halle, D√ºrer at Nuremberg, Luther at Wittenberg, and Grand Duke Paul Friedrich at Schwerin. By 1824, he had executed 70 busts in marble of which 20 were of colossal size. His colossal bronze statues of Bl√ºcher are 13 feet in height, and he also executed the greater part of the 12 statues in iron which compose the National Monument for the Liberation Wars on the Kreuzberg, near Berlin. One of his finest works is the group ‚ÄúFaith, Hope and Charity,‚Äù which he presented to his native town, Arolsen. At length, in 1830, Rauch began, along with the architect Karl Friedrich Schinkel, the models for a colossal equestrian monument at Berlin to honor King Frederick II of Prussia (Frederick the Great). This work was inaugurated with great pomp in May 1851, and is regarded as one of the masterpieces of modern sculpture, the crowning achievement of Rauch's work as a portrait and historic sculptor. Princes decorated Rauch with honors and the academies of Europe enrolled him among their members. A statue of Immanuel Kant for K√∂nigsberg and a statue of Albrecht Thaer for Berlin occupied his attention during some of his last years; and he had just finished a model of Moses praying between Aaron and Hur when he was attacked by his last illness. In 1837 Rauch became associated member of the Royal Institute of the Netherlands.He died at Dresden, aged 80.

His sons included Henry Thomas Hope and Alexander Beresford Hope. Early years in Amsterdam and Heemstede The eldest son of Jan Hope, Thomas was descended from a branch of an old Scottish family who for several generations were merchant bankers known as the Hopes of Amsterdam, or Hope & Co. He inherited from his mother a love of the arts, which the efforts of his father and grandfather made possible by acquiring an enormous wealth. His father spent his final years turning his summer home Groenendaal Park in Heemstede into a grand park of sculpture open to the public. After he fled to London with his brothers to avoid the French occupation of the Netherlands from 1795‚Äì1810, he never returned. Grand tour In 1784, when young Thomas was fifteen, his father died unexpectedly in the Hague just after purchasing Bosbeek on the grounds of Groenendaal Park, the house that was to house his large art collection. He shared his art collection as part of the Hope & Co. partnership with his cousin Henry Hope. This cousin was just completing work on his Villa Welgelegen further up the road. Missing his father and grandfather, and preferring the company of his mother and brothers to his uncles in Amsterdam, Thomas did not enter the family business. Instead, at the age of eighteen, he began to devote more and more of his time to the study of all the arts, especially the architecture of classical civilisation, during a series of tours to other countries. During his grand tour through Europe, Asia and Africa, Hope interested himself especially in architecture and sculpture, making a large collection of artefacts which attracted his attention (e.g. the Hope Dionysus). Move to London Thomas Hope returned to the Hague when his mother died in 1794. That same year, the three Hope brothers, along with their elder cousin Henry Hope, who was the executor of their mother's will, fled to London before the oncoming French revolutionary forces marching on Amsterdam. In their haste to remove their art collections to the safety of London, the Hopes left their houses, summer homes and parks full of wall decorations, furniture, and heavy statuary. Later, after the French occupation, Thomas's younger brother Adrian Elias would return to live at Groenendaal Park full- time and expand the gardens. Cousin Henry always hoped to return to his home, Villa Welgelegen, but he died in 1811 before King Willem restored Dutch sovereignty in 1814. Career as an interior decorator The Hopes established a residence in London in Duchess Street, off Portland Place. Experienced from his extensive travel, Thomas Hope enjoyed the cosmopolitan atmosphere of London, while his younger brothers missed their home in the Netherlands. He decorated the house in a very elaborate style, from drawings made himself with each room taking on a different style influenced by the countries he had visited. In essence, the combined art collections of Hope & Co., his parents and Henry Hope gave him the opportunity to further research the various art he had studied during his travels and he began to write books on decoration and furniture, the first of its kind. In the same way he had done with Villa Welgelegen, Henry Hope opened the house as a semi-public museum. The house museum included three vase galleries filled with Ancient Greek and South Italian vases the Hopes purchased from Sir William Hamilton's second vase collection. In this eclectic wealthy residence of bachelors, younger brother Henry Philip oversaw the gem collection (acquiring the Hope Diamond and the Hope Pearl), while cousin Henry busied himself with the banking business and the Louisiana Purchase, together with Barings. Thomas Hope did not settle in London, however. He took up his grand tour where he left off, and in 1795 he began his extensive tours of the Ottoman Empire which included visits to Turkey, Rhodes, Egypt, Syria, and Arabia. He stayed for about a year in Istanbul/Constantinople during which he produced some 350 drawings depicting the people and places he witnessed in the Ottoman Empire, a collection now to be found in the Benaki Museum, Athens. During these travels, he was given free rein by the Hope & Co. firm to collect many paintings, sculptures, antique objects and books, some of which were destined to be displayed for the public in Amsterdam in the branch offices on the Keizersgracht 444, and some of which were destined for his London house in Duchess Street in 1804. Marriage and move to Deepdene After his marriage to Louisa de la Poer Beresford in 1806, Hope acquired a country seat at Deepdene, near Dorking in Surrey. Here, surrounded by his large collections of paintings, sculpture and antiques, Deepdene became a famous resort of men of letters as well as of people of fashion. Among the luxuries suggested by his fine taste, and provided to his guests, was a miniature library in several languages in each bedroom. He also gave frequent employment to artists, sculptors and craftsmen. Bertel Thorvaldsen, the Danish sculptor, was indebted to him for the early recognition of his talents, and he was also a patron to Francis Legatt Chantrey and John Flaxman; it was to his order that the latter illustrated the writings of Dante Alighieri. He developed the gardens in a particular version of picturesque style. Hope was noted for his snobbery and ugliness, one contemporary describing him as \\"undoubtedly far from the most agreeable man in Europe. He is a little ill-looking man‚Ä¶with an effeminate face and manner.\\"Bryans, Robin The Dust Has Never Settled, Honeyford Press, London 1992, p151 When the French painter Antoine Dubost exhibited a portrait of him titled 'Beauty and the Beast', portraying him as a monster offering his wife jewels, it caused a public scandal: the painting was mutilated by Louisa's brother. A further scandal arose in 1810 when Hope took up with a beautiful young Greek sailor, Aide, and attempted to launch him into Society.Bryans, Robin The Dust Has Never Settled, Honeyford Press, London 1992, pp151, 157 Hope was the father of Henry Thomas Hope, art patron and politician and Alexander James Beresford Beresford Hope, author and politician. Writing Hope was eager to advance public awareness of historical painting and design and to influence design in the grand houses of Regency London. In pursuit of his scholarly projects, he began sketching furniture, room interiors and costumes, and publishing books with his accompanying scholarly texts. In 1807 Thomas Hope published sketches of his furniture, in a folio volume, titled Household Furniture and Interior Decoration, which had considerable influence and brought about a change in the upholstery and interior decoration of houses. Hope's furniture designs were in the pseudo-classical manner generally called \\"English Empire\\". It was sometimes extravagant, and often heavy, but was much more restrained than the wilder and later flights of Thomas Sheraton in this style. In 1809 he published the Costumes of the Ancients, and in 1812 Designs of Modern Costumes, works which display a large amount of antiquarian research. A Historical Essay on Architecture, which featured illustrations based on early Hope drawings, was published posthumously by his family in 1835. Thus Hope became famous in London's aristocratic circles as 'the costume and furniture man'. The sobriquet was regarded as a compliment by his enthusiastic supporters, but for his critics, including Lord Byron, it was a term of ridicule. =Anastasius= Yearning for a different type of literary acclaim as he approached the age of fifty, Hope began work on a novel with the enthusiastic encouragement of a few close friends. The result completed in 1819, Anastasius, was a work of such academic interest, raw excitement and descriptive power that the first edition released by fabled London publisher, John Murray, became an overnight sensation. A second edition sold out in twenty-four hours. Foreign translations in French, German and Flemish quickly followed. The novel lifted a curtain of ignorance about the East without being a mere retelling of Hope's own travels. The eponymous narrator-hero Anastasius was fearless, curious, cunning, ruthless, brave and, above all, sexy. As a newly converted Muslim mercenary soldier, Selim, his travels threw him among friends, lovers and enemies. Hope's descriptions revealed the lives of the inhabitants of the Ottoman Empire and provided astonishing glimpses of the wars fought among the Turks, Russians and Wahabees. It also described many previously unknown details of Islamic culture: music, language, cuisine, religion, laws and literature. Because of his modesty, Hope originally chose not to declare his authorship of Anastasius in the first edition. Ironically, given Hope's mild reputation, the authorship of the dashing Anastasius was at first mistakenly attributed to Lord Byron, who, according to legend, confided to Marguerite, Countess of Blessington, that he wept bitterly on reading it. \\"To have been the author of Anastasius, I would have given the two poems which brought me the most glory.\\" These events prompted Hope to reveal his identity as author in later editions, adding a map of Anastasius's travels and fine- tuning the text, although his authorship was initially greeted with incredulity by some journals. Soon after Hope's death in 1831, his widow Louisa remarried her cousin William Carr Beresford, 1st Viscount Beresford. His family thereafter embraced conservative values, causing them to authorise the demolition of the writer's legendary London home, disperse his fabled art collection, and distance themselves from his Oriental masterpiece. No substantial collection of Hope's personal papers survived the family indifference and Anastasius, his magnum opus, became a victim of the sanctimonious morality of the Victorian age. Nevertheless, it influenced the later works of William Thackeray, Mark Twain and Herman Melville. More recently, the noted Orientalist, Robert Irwin, wrote, \\"this book, one of the most important books of the nineteenth century, should be much more widely read.\\" In addition to his other accomplishments, Hope was the author of an important philosophical work published posthumously, The Origin and Prospect of Man (1831), in which his speculations diverged widely from the social and religious views of the Victorian age. This volume, which has been cited by philosophy expert Roger Scruton, was a highly eclectic work and took a global view of the challenges facing humanity. In his obituary published in The Mirror of Literature, Amusement, and Instruction Volume 17, No. 476, Saturday, 12 February 1831, it was written, \\"We remember the opinion of a writer in the Edinburgh Review, soon after the publication of Anastasius. With a degree of pleasantry and acumen peculiar to northern criticism, he asks, 'Where has Mr. Hope hidden all his eloquence and poetry up to this hour? How is it that he has, all of a sudden, burst out into descriptions which would not disgrace the pen of Tacitus, and displayed a depth of feeling and vigour of imagination which Lord Byron could not excel? We do not shrink from one syllable of this eulogy.'\\" Still commonly known among literary circles as \\"Anastasius Hope\\", the combined artistic legacy of Thomas Hope is still of universal interest and importance. Death and legacy In early 1831 Hope fell ill. He died on 2 February at Duchess Street; and was laid to rest on 12 February in the mausoleum at Deepdene.Orbell 2008. In his later years he had cemented his position in society, despite never obtaining a peerage. By the time of his death his contribution to art and architecture had been widely recognised. The two houses Hope created have been lost; that in Duchess Street was demolished by his son in 1851 and Deepdene in 1969. The only complete surviving structure built by Hope is the Deepdene mausoleum. Built in 1818, the structure was the first recorded work at Deepdene. It was permanently sealed in 1957 and buried in 1960. The Mausolea and Monuments Trust has been working with Mole Valley District Council to rescue the structure and is running a campaign to excavate and repair it.. The principal elevation was excavated in 2013, with further restoration in 2016.

It was originally known as the Woolwich Warren, having begun on land previously used as a domestic warren in the grounds of a Tudor house, Tower Place. Much of the initial history of the site is linked with that of the Office of Ordnance, which purchased the Warren in the late 17th century in order to expand an earlier base at Gun Wharf in Woolwich Dockyard. Over the next two centuries, as operations grew and innovations were pursued, the site expanded massively; at the time of the First World War the Arsenal covered and employed close to 80,000 people. Thereafter its operations were scaled down; it finally closed as a factory in 1967 and the Ministry of Defence moved out in 1994. Today the area, so long a secret enclave, is open to the public and is being redeveloped for housing and community use. 17th-century origins: the Gun Wharf and Tower Place Royal Military Academy The Royal Arsenal had its origins in a domestic warren at Tower Place in Old Woolwich. Tower Place was a Tudor mansion built in the 1540s for Martin Bowes, a wealthy goldsmith and merchant, later Lord Mayor of London. The house with its octagonal tower stood nearby Gun Wharf (the original site of Woolwich Dockyard where the Henry Grace √† Dieu had been built around 1515). After the Dockyard moved west in the 1540s, Gun Wharf was acquired by the Office of Ordnance and mainly used for gun storage.Saint & Guillery (2012), pp. 38-41, 129-130. In 1651, the owners of Tower Place gave the board permission to prove its guns on the warren that formed part of their land. That same year the first proof butts were built on the site, under the board's direction (24 years later they were enlarged, to enable more guns to be proved at each firing). =Purchase of the site= In 1667, in response to the raid on the Medway, a gun battery (known as Prince Rupert's Battery, being under the command of the King's cousin) was built in the grounds of the house, designed to defend London in the event of a similar raid on the Thames. The following year, Tower Place was acquired by Sir William Pritchard who promptly entered into negotiations to sell it to the Board of Ordnance; and in 1671, the estate was given to the board in exchange for the Gun Wharf and a substantial amount of cash. The board at the time declared the site to be \\"a convenient place for building a storehouse for powder and other stores of war, and for room for the proof of guns\\".Records of the Privy Council 1769-71, quoted in Saint & Guillery (2012), p134. The first Storekeeper, Captain Francis Cheeseman, was appointed in 1670 by Warrant of the Master-General of the Ordnance. =Proof and experiment= In 1681, King Charles II visited the Warren and observed Richard Leake, Master Gunner of England, conduct an experiment with fire-shot in the proof butts. In 1682 what had till then been the board's main proving ground (in 'Old Artillery Garden' near its headquarters in the Tower of London) was closed and its staff and activities were promptly moved to Tower Place. That year a thousand cannon and ten thousand cannonballs were sent to Woolwich from the Tower, and the proof butts were further expanded. When the constitution of the Board of Ordnance was formalised by Charles II in 1683, two Proof Masters were appointed, under the Surveyor-General of the Ordnance, to ensure that proofs and trials were conducted correctly and the results duly certified. In 1684 the King paid another visit, when Leake conducted a trial of his newly-developed mortar design. =Centralisation of ordnance stores= In 1688 it was ordered that 'all guns, carriages and stores now at Deptford, be removed to Woolwich, and from henceforth new ordnance and carriages be laid there'. No manufacturing took place at this stage, however, except for the periodical production of fireworks for state celebrations; (between 1681 and 1694 saltpetre, a key ingredient of gunpowder, was regularly refined on the site). In due course, the site as a whole became known as The Warren. 18th century: The Warren A map drawn in 1701 shows a triangle of carriage sheds (built over Prince Rupert's Battery, top left), proof butts and experiment area (top right), the Laboratory quadrangle (bottom) and land in between used for storage The Board of Ordnance was both a civil and a military office of State, independent of the Army, overseen by a high-ranking official, the Master-General of the Ordnance. Both branches, civil and military, were represented at the Warren; indeed there was a great deal of overlap: military officers for the most part headed up the civil departments, and civilians often worked alongside the military personnel. =The civil establishment= For most of its history, the civil establishment of the Warren/Arsenal consisted of the following four departments: * The Storekeeper's Department (which managed storage of all kinds of 'warlike stores') * The Royal Laboratory (which manufactured ammunition of all kinds, for small arms as well as artillery) * The Royal Brass Foundry (which manufactured artillery pieces and was later renamed the Royal Gun Factory) * The Royal Carriage Department (which manufactured gun carriages) In addition, proof butts continued to be maintained by the Board of Ordnance to test guns beyond their normal operational limits and for experimenting with new types of ammunition. The storekeeper's department Shot stacked up outside the Royal Laboratory gates and rows of guns arrayed in the background (James Cockburn, 1795). First and foremost, the Warren was established as an Ordnance storage depot. As at the board's other depots, the site was overseen by an official called the storekeeper, who was provided with an official residence in Tower Place itself. The Storekeeper not only controlled the receipt, safekeeping and issue of all the items that were stored on the site; he was also responsible (until the early 1800s) for issuing payments on the board's behalf to all personnel across the different departments. He was assisted by a clerk of the cheque, clerk of the survey and other administrative staff. To begin with much of the Warren was preserved as open space with cannons stored in the open air and guns proved on ranges to the east. (Proof-testing was overseen at this time by the Master Gunner of England, who was also accommodated in Tower Place.) Gunpowder was stored in a converted dovecote initially; but before long specialist buildings began to appear. The Royal Laboratory One of a pair of 17th-century pavilions, the earliest buildings on the site, undergoing restoration, 2015 An ammunition laboratory (i.e. workshop) was set up at the Warren in 1695, overseen by the Comptroller of Fireworks. Manufacture of ammunition had previously taken place within a Great Barn on the tilt-yard at Greenwich Palace (an offshoot of the royal armoury there); but in 1695 construction of Greenwich Hospital began on the palace site, so the laboratory was relocated downstream at Woolwich (the barn building itself was even disassembled and rebuilt at the Warren). In 1696 Laboratory Square was built to house its operations, which included manufacture of gunpowder, shell cases, fuses and paper gun cartridges; it consisted of a quadrangle with a gateway at the north end, buildings along either side and a clock tower at the south end, beyond which further buildings were ranged. The manufacturing process was conducted by hand, overseen by a Chief Firemaster; early paintings show artisans at work in the courtyards among pyramid stacks of shells. A pair of pavilions, which once faced each other across the centre of the courtyard, are now the oldest surviving buildings on the Arsenal site; they were being restored for residential use in 2013. The Comptroller, Royal Laboratory, had oversight of the Royal Gunpowder Mills in addition to the Woolwich manufactory. From time to time there were public demonstrations of the work of the Laboratory, often in Hyde Park, and by the mid-18th century it was customary for the Royal Laboratory to provide an official 'fireworks display' on occasions such as coronations, peace treaties, royal jubilees etc. The Royal Brass Foundry The Royal Brass Foundry (1717) A gun foundry, overseen by a Master Founder, was established in 1717. (The decision of the Board of Ordnance to set up and supervise its own foundry operations followed a devastating explosion at the private foundry it had previously used in Moorfields.) In Woolwich, the original Royal Brass Foundry building survives (built on the site of the relocated \\"Greenwich Barn\\"). Its handsome exterior encloses a space designed for pure industrial functionality, with height to accommodate a vertical boring machine, and tall doors permitting easy removal of newly made cannons. Completed guns could then be taken through what is now Dial Arch into a complex known as the 'Great Pile of buildings' (built 1717-20) to be finished and stored. Behind the surviving frontage and archway was a small courtyard in which the newly forged guns were turned, washed and engraved; beyond which two large gun-carriage storehouses stood (one for the Navy, one for the Army) at either end of a larger quadrangle, with workshops alongside. Verbruggen's horizontal boring machine at Woolwich The first Master Founder, Andrew Schalch, served in post for 54 years before retiring in 1769 at the age of 78. In 1770 a revolutionary horse- powered horizontal boring machine was installed in the Foundry by his successor, Jan Verbruggen which inspired Henry Maudslay (who worked at the foundry from 1783) to his inventions improving the lathe. Remarkably, it remained in use until 1843 when a steam-powered equivalent replaced it. From 1780 a new official, the Inspector of Artillery, was given oversight of the Royal Brass Foundry and of other aspects of gun manufacture including carriage-making (for the time being) and proof-testing, which continued to take place on ranges to the east; (over the next hundred years the proof ranges were moved progressively further eastwards as the Arsenal continued to expand). The carriage works A map of 1746 shows 'The Warren' (right) with its three quadrangles: (from left-right) the original Laboratory (1696), the 'Great Pile' (1717-20) and New Carriage Square (1728-9) From the beginning, gun carriages had been stored at the Warren (unlike the guns themselves the wooden carriages had to be kept under cover). The first store ('Old Carriage Yard') had been built as early as 1682, and probably also contained workshops for the repair or scrapping of old carriages. In 1697 a far larger complex of sheds ('New Carriage Yard') was built on what had been Prince Rupert's gun battery. By the 1750s manufacture of gun carriages was also taking place on site, overseen by the Constructor of Carriages. This took place around New Carriage Square (a low quadrangle of storehouses built alongside, and as an extension of, the Great Pile storehouses in 1728‚Äì1729). In 1803 this activity was formalized as the Royal Carriage Department, a recognition of the importance of effective carriage design and manufacture, alongside that of guns and ammunition, as part of ordnance provision. =The military establishment= By 1700 the Board of Ordnance had a team of 20 gunners stationed in the Warren, overseen by the Master Gunner of England, who (except in time of war) assisted in the manufacture as well as the proving of cannons. Building, repair and technical work was undertaken by the board's (civil) artificers, who were drafted in from the Tower of London as and when required. In many respects 'there was no distinction between the Ordnance soldier and the Ordnance civilian' at this time, and a close working relationship endured between the two constituencies across subsequent decades. The military constitution of the Board of Ordnance was strengthened when, on 26 May 1716, a Royal Warrant directed that two companies of artillery (of a hundred men each, plus officers) and a separate corps of twenty-six military engineers (all officers) be formed on a permanent basis: this marked the foundation of the Royal Artillery and the Royal Engineers. Both had their headquarters in the Warren for a time and (when not mobilized for war) they were regularly engaged in its work. The regiment of artillery Former barracks of 1739 undergoing renovation in 2016 The two companies of artillery (referred to as 'Royal Artillery' by 1720) were quartered and based at the Warren. By 1722 the detachment had grown and was formally named the Royal Regiment of Artillery. These troops (who were not under the command of the Army but of the Board of Ordnance) provided a versatile workforce on site, as well as helping ensure its security. In 1719 they were provided with their own barracks within the compound, close to Dial Arch: a single block was built, housing 200 men in open barracks accommodation across four floors, with a pair of officers' houses incorporated at each end. (This block has since been demolished, but an identical block (now known as Building 11), survives; it was built alongside the first in 1739‚Äì1740, the Regiment having been enlarged). After the formation of the Regiment in 1716, the Royal Artillery took on responsibility for conducting proof tests and the (recently renamed) post of Master Gunner of Great Britain was abolished. Proving guns at the Warren became part of routine training for gunners of the Royal Artillery, overseen at first by the Board's proofmaster-general (and then, after 1780, by the Inspector of Artillery). In addition to the proof butts, a range was set up in 1787 for gunnery practice, firing parallel to the river across Plumstead Marshes. The Corps of Engineers An Order in Council (dated 22 August 1717) increased the size of the Engineer Corps to fifty officers (including the Chief Engineer). Serving under the Board of Ordnance, they received their commissions from the Master-General until 1757 when the King granted them commission and rank equivalent to officers of the Army. In a Royal Warrant of 1787 the Corps (which was still composed solely of officers) was renamed the Corps of Royal Engineers. Initially, civilians were employed as workers, but in 1787 a Corps of Royal Military Artificers was formed: a body of non- commissioned officers and men who were placed under the command of officers from the Corps of Royal Engineers. From 1795 both these Corps were headquartered in the Warren; alongside their other duties, they had responsibility for the design, construction and maintenance of buildings, wharves and other features across the Arsenal site. The Royal Military Academy The original Royal Military Academy building (1718-20) within the Arsenal complex; it later served as the Royal Arsenal Officers' Mess until 1994 In 1720, the Board sought to establish an on-site military academy for the education of its Artillery and Engineer officers. Tower Place had by this time largely been demolished, and a new building was erected in its place to provide a base for the new academy alongside a Board Room for the Ordnance Board (with a new residence for the Storekeeper added to the rear). It would not be until 1741, however, that the Royal Military Academy was set up on a firm footing and occupied its rooms in the building. Soon, the Academy's cadets were given their own purpose-built barracks alongside the southern boundary wall; dating from 1751, these were entirely demolished in the 1980s for road widening. The Cadet Barracks, which stood just east of Beresford Gate, in 1851. The Royal Military Repository An offshoot of the Academy was the Royal Military Repository. In the 1770s Captain William Congreve built a \\"Repository for Military Machines\\" between New Carriage Square and some open ground to the east. The building housed an educative display of cannons and mortars, and the open space was used as a training ground to help develop skills in handling large artillery pieces on various terrains in different conflict scenarios. The Ordnance Field Train In 1792, with Britain on the cusp of war with France, the Board of Ordnance established a Field Train department to ensure supply and storage of guns, ammunition and other equipment for its Artillery and Engineers serving in the field of battle. The small corps (which had its headquarters in the Arsenal) was composed of a permanent cadre of officers, who were supplemented at time of war by uniformed civilians (many of whom were volunteers recruited from the ordnance storekeeper's department). In addition, a number of Royal Artillery sergeants served in the Field Train as Conductors. (The Ordnance Field Train was disbanded following the abolition of the Board of Ordnance, but is now seen as a precursor of the Royal Army Ordnance Corps). The Field Train had its offices in the main guard house and stored its guns, carriages and other equipment in a large building known as the Blue Storehouse (which was near the old Carriage Yard). Removal of the military to Woolwich Common By the 1770s the number of artillerymen accommodated in the Warren had increased to 900, prompting the construction of a new Royal Artillery Barracks on the north side of Woolwich Common, where they moved in 1777; whereupon their old barracks were converted into terraces of houses (they continued to house artillery officers for some years, and were later used for senior staff of the Royal Laboratory). The Commandant Woolwich Garrison remained quartered in the Arsenal until 1839, when he was provided with a new house on Woolwich Common (Government House). The Royal Military Repository was destroyed along with New Carriage Square in the fire of 1802, but soon re-established itself just west of the new Artillery Barracks in the area now known as the Repository Grounds (which continue to be used for military training to this day). What survived of the items on display at the Repository came to be housed in the Rotunda there from 1820 (having been kept in the old Academy building in the interim), where they formed the nucleus of a new Royal Artillery Museum. In place of the old Repository in the Warren, a new Royal Engineers Establishment was built in 1803 (next to, and contemporary with, the new Carriage Factory).PLAN shewing the ORDNANCE GROUND and adjacent parts at WOOLWICH March, 1810 It was a sizeable quadrangle of workshops and other facilities, which served as the Royal Engineers' headquarters until 1856 (when it was converted into a wheel factory for the adjacent Royal Carriage Works). Also in 1803, the Royal Military Artificers were provided with new barracks, outside the Warren (south of Love Lane, halfway between the Warren and the Common); the corps was renamed the Royal Sappers and Miners in 1812. In 1824 the Commanding Royal Engineer, until then resident in the Arsenal, was given a new house in Mill Lane on the edge of the Common. In 1856 the Royal Sappers and Miners merged with the Royal Engineers and the headquarters of the newly unified Corps was moved from Woolwich to Chatham; a small detachment of Engineer officers was retained in Woolwich, however, alongside the house in Mill Lane, where an office building and a works yard were built. The Royal Engineers (after a brief hiatus) retained responsibility for design and construction of the Arsenal's buildings and other structures, latterly as part of the Building Works Department, which remained active until the 1950s. The Ordnance Field Train also left the Warren, in 1804, moving scores of combat-ready field guns and large stocks of ammunition into the newly-built carriage sheds and magazines of what became known as the Grand Dep√¥t (which stretched from the new Artificers' barracks up towards the new Artillery barracks). Storekeeper's House (1807-10), latterly known as Middlegate House. The Royal Military Academy was relocated to the south side of the Common in 1806. The old Academy building, together with the adjacent Storekeeper's residence, then became part of the Royal Laboratory; so the Storekeeper (who still had seniority within the Arsenal) was given a sizeable new house on what was then the south-east edge of the site (later overtaken by expansion, it came to be named after the nearby Middle Gate, the second of three main gates in the Arsenal's perimeter wall). The Cadet Barracks continued to be occupied by the Academy for some time afterwards, initially housing the 'Lower Establishment' (junior cadets), and later accommodating the Practical Class, formed of senior cadets awaiting commission. From the 1860s the cadet barracks began to be converted for other uses, but they were still occasionally used by the Academy as overflow accommodation until as late as 1882. =Consolidation of the site= The Main Guard House (1787-8) provided accommodation for a detachment of Artillery after the regiment moved to the Common By 1777 the site had expanded to . The purchase that year of additional land to the east allowed the proof butts to be relocated, realigned and extended in 1779. This in turn freed up additional land on the old Warren site which would be used for a series of substantial building projects in the early 19th century. In 1777‚Äì1778, convict labour was used to construct a (approximately) brick boundary wall, generally high. In 1804 this wall was raised to near the Plumstead road, and to in other parts. (The first boundary wall had been built in 1702, prior to which the Warren had operated on open ground.) The riverside guard rooms (1815) flanked a grand set of steps in the newly built wharf, which became the principal point of entry from the river Use of convict labour was key to this period of expansion. It was used to construct a huge new wharf, completed in 1813, and then again in 1814‚Äì1816 to dig a canal (the Ordnance Canal), which formed the eastern boundary of the site. Guardhouses were built at points on the perimeter; one at the main gate (1787‚Äì1788) and a pair by the new wharf (1814‚Äì1815) are still in place today. Security at this time was provided by troops of the Royal Artillery (though from 1843 they began to share guard duties with the Metropolitan Police, who took over responsibility in 1861). The River Thames was key to the Warren and its operations from the earliest days. A dock was built as part of the rebuilt wharf to facilitate loading and unloading from ships (it was supplemented in 1856 by the first in a series of substantial piers). The canal, as well as forming a boundary, provided access for barges; these were initially used to deliver timber to the heart of the carriage- building department and later provided a transit route for guns and explosives. 19th century: The Arsenal Map of the Royal Arsenal, 1867 In 1805, at the suggestion of King George III, the entire complex became known as the Royal Arsenal; its constituent elements retained their independence, however. =Expansion during the Napoleonic Wars= The Napoleonic wars prompted an increase of activity at the Arsenal, which affected all areas of its operation. Royal Carriage Works frontage, 1803-5 In 1803‚Äì1805 a substantial Royal Carriage Factory was built (on the site of New Carriage Square, which had been destroyed by fire - possibly arson - the previous year). Its outer walls, complete with a contemporary chiming clock, survive; within, where there are now new apartment blocks, there was once a vast engineering and manufacturing complex staffed by wheelwrights, carpenters, blacksmiths and metalworkers. It was here that steam power first came to be used in the Arsenal, when Joseph Bramah installed his patented planing machine in 1805. The Arsenal was soon a renowned centre of excellence in mechanical engineering, with notable engineers including Samuel Bentham, Marc Isambard Brunel and Henry Maudslay employed there. Brunel was responsible for erecting the steam sawmills, part of the Royal Carriage Department; Maudslay later expanded this buying more steam machinery. The Arsenal also became a noted research facility, developing several key advances in armament design and manufacture. One example was the innovative Congreve Rocket, designed and (from 1805) manufactured on site by William Congreve (son of the Comptroller of the Royal Laboratory). Thenceforward rocket manufacture became a key activity, carried out in purpose-built premises on the eastern edge of the site. Part of the early 19th-century Grand Store complex Between 1805 and 1813 the massive Grand Stores complex was constructed alongside new wharves by the river; though celebrated as a landmark of size and dignity befitting the Arsenal, the buildings were immediately, and for many years afterwards, vulnerable to subsidence due to their proximity to the river (this was caused in no small part by on-site supervisors directing the use of cheaper wooden piles in place of the stone foundations specified by the architect, James Wyatt). The buildings formed a three-sided quadrangle of warehouses facing the river, with the central open space used as a shot-yard. (The main range of buildings was flanked by smaller quadrangles to the east and west, only fragments of which survive.) The Grand Store was not uniquely, or even primarily, designed as an artillery store, but rather as warehousing for all kinds of military equipment: an early example of a planned integrated military stores complex. New Laboratory Square: the east range of 1808 From 1808, \\"New Laboratory Square\\" began to be developed to the north of the original Laboratory complex, with an open-sided quadrangle built around an eighteenth- century Naval storehouse; initially used for storage, it came to be used for manufacturing from the 1850s. (It replaced the 'East Laboratory', a quadrangle of buildings which had been demolished to make way for the Grand Store.) Earlier, in 1804, subsidiary Royal Laboratories were set up in the Dockyard towns of Portsmouth and Devonport and in Upnor Castle near Chatham. The Devonport Laboratory (on Mount Wise) had been converted into barracks by 1834 but ten years later Portsmouth's (which had been overtaken by dockyard expansion) was relocated to Priddy's Hard, where manufacture (initially of small arms ammunition, later of shells and fuzes) continued, overseen from Woolwich. Proof work continued at this time. In 1803 a burst gun caused damage to nearby buildings, which prompted construction of a new set of proof butts further to the east; these opened (on what would later be the site of the Arsenal's gasworks) in 1808. Starting in 1811, a project was begun to raise the ground level of the eastern part of the Arsenal site, as far as the canal, using material dredged from the river bed (a huge undertaking, which took nine years to complete). Also in 1811, a further 20 acres of marshland to the east was purchased, with a view to re-siting the gunnery range (so as to make room for the new sawmills); a 1,250-yard range was then built. In 1838, however, it was accepted that (due to improved ballistics) a much longer range was required; this would require multiple land purchases (at great expense), but was eventually achieved in 1855 when a 3,000-yard range was opened. At the same time, new proof butts were constructed alongside the range. Peacetime contraction Levels of arms manufacture naturally ebbed during the relatively peaceful years after the Battle of Waterloo; between 1815 and 1835 the size of the workforce shrank from 5,000 to 500 (not including military personnel and convicts). At the same time, the Arsenal fell behind the pace of technological change. In the early 1840s, Scottish engineering pioneer James Nasmyth toured the site and described it as a 'museum of technical antiquity'. Nasmyth was subsequently engaged to help modernize the complex, but it was only when Britain was on the brink of war that the pace of mechanization increased until, by 1857 (within the space of a decade), the Arsenal had 2,773 specialized machines at work powered by 68 stationary steam engines. A similar pattern of development was seen at the other Board of Ordnance manufacturing sites: the Royal Small Arms Factory, Enfield and the Royal Gun Powder Factory, Waltham Abbey. =Crimean War: mechanisation and innovation= The gatehouse: all that remains of the 1856 Shot and Shell Foundry By 1854, the old Laboratory Square had been roofed over to serve as a vast machine shop at the heart of what was now a munitions factory. The open spaces of the Royal Carriage Works were similarly roofed over and mechanised, and the area of its operations expanded; its carpenters and wheelwrights were moved out into new workshops (which later developed into what is now Gunnery House) east of the main building. (This area had previously been used for the storage and seasoning of the timber used for building the gun carriages.) The building of a new Shot and Shell Foundry, an addition to the Royal Laboratory completed in 1856, enabled manufacture of the latest types of ammunition; this huge complex covered the whole of what is now Wellington Park, and later expanded further to the east. Part of the former Iron Foundry (aka Armstrong Gun Factory) now known as Cannon House The Royal Brass Foundry was renamed the Royal Gun Factory in 1855, and its workshops expanded into the Great Pile (Dial Arch) quadrangles. For the first time it diversified into manufacture of iron cannons (which had previously always been commissioned from private contractors); for this it developed a new and much larger foundry complex (on the far side of the Shot and Shell Foundry) which was completed in 1857. The new foundry building, which still stands, was subdivided into three sections (for moulding, casting and trimming) and complemented by a separate forge and boring mill. The early years of its work were defined by famed arms manufacturer William George Armstrong, who in 1859 made his patented designs for rifled ordnance available for government use; (the Arsenal had previously been unable to replicate its effectiveness in-house). He was duly rewarded with a knighthood and the part-time position of Superintendent of the Royal Gun Factory at Woolwich; after further expansion of the factory complex he resigned in 1863 following the demonstration of an even more powerful rifled gun by his rival Sir Joseph Whitworth. Abel's Laboratory, Building 20 As part of the preparations for the Crimean War (1854‚Äì1856), Frederick Abel (later Sir Frederick Abel) had been appointed the first War Department Chemist with the aim of investigating the new chemical explosives which were then being developed. He was mostly responsible for bringing Guncotton into safe use and for winning a patent dispute brought by Alfred Nobel against the British Government over the patent rights to Cordite which Abel had jointly developed with Professor James Dewar. A new Chemical Laboratory was built to Abel's requirements; this was numbered Building 20. Abel was also responsible for the technical management of the Royal Gunpowder Factory. He retired from the Royal Arsenal in 1888. A view of the Arsenal in 1858; guns and shot continued to be stored in the open until the 20th century 1854 saw the installation of a Retort house for what would become the Royal Arsenal's Gas Works, which was established close to what was then the north-east corner of the site, just west of the canal. Its Superintendent additionally had charge of all hydraulic equipment (lifts, cranes etc.) in use around the Arsenal site (other than that used directly in the process of manufacturing); a pair of hydraulic accumulator towers were built within the eastern outer quadrangle of the Grand Store in 1855 (replacing parts of the building demolished due to subsidence twenty years earlier), which drove machinery throughout the adjacent stores complex. Demise of the Ordnance Board In the wake of the Crimean War there was widespread criticism of several aspects of Britain's military command. The Board of Ordnance, much criticised for inefficiency, was disbanded in 1855, and the War Office then took over responsibility for the Arsenal and all its activities. A Military Stores Department was established, with its headquarters in the Arsenal's Grand Store. The manufacturing departments were mostly left to their own devices, though the Ordnance Select Committee (initially set up to assess the merits of the Armstrong Gun) took some responsibility for overseeing ongoing research and development; it and its successors were given Verbruggen's House to serve as offices and a board room from 1859. =After Crimea= The \\"great crane\\" of 1876, photographed c.1888; part of the Royal Gun Factory As had happened earlier in the century, the wartime expansion of the 1850s was followed by spending cuts, and workforce contraction, in the 1860s. Twenty years later, though, the Arsenal began to grow again as investment in weaponry research and manufacture resumed. The narrow-gauge Royal Arsenal Railway was opened in 1873, complemented later by a standard-gauge network connected to the main line. Electricity arrived in the Arsenal in the 1870s; initially used for lighting, it was soon used to power all kinds of machinery. An on-site power station was opened (on the site of the east quadrangle of the Grand Store) in 1896. Mechanical and managerial developments A 103-ton anvil, cast on-site in 1873 and formerly used in the rolling mill, is preserved by Wellington Park The Arsenal was still made up of separate divisions. The manufacturing departments (which soon came to be called Ordnance Factories) were each overseen by a (largely independent) Superintendent (who answered directly to the Director of Artillery and Stores): the Royal Laboratory continued to use hundreds of lathes to manufacture ammunition (including bullets, shrapnel shells, fuzes, percussion caps, as well as shot and shells); the Royal Carriage Department continued to build gun carriages, with metal fast replacing wood for this purpose; and the Royal Gun Factory expanded still further, with a new rolling mill and associated boiler house and forge being erected in the early 1870s, and a huge boring-mill ten years later. Tentative moves toward the manufacture of steel guns were made at this time, though these were mainly sourced from outside contractors; it was not till the turn of the century that iron gun manufacture finally ceased in the Arsenal. BL 6\\" guns) Each Factory was responsible for the initial design and final inspection of items, as well as for the intervening manufacturing process. Once completed, all items manufactured on site passed to the Ordnance Store Department, overseen by the Commissary-General of Ordnance (successor to the Storekeepers of old). He had oversight of one of the world's largest depots for military equipment (following the closure of Woolwich Dockyard in 1869 its site had been given over to serve the department as a storage depot); he also had a degree of seniority across the Arsenal as a whole, being responsible for receiving orders from the Director of Artillery and Stores and disseminating them across the departments. The South Boring Mill in 1897 The three Ordnance Factories guarded their autonomy and resisted efforts made to place them under a single command (the appointment in 1868 of a Brigadier-General with the title 'Director-General of Ordnance and Commandant of the Royal Arsenal' was an initiative which lasted only two years). Since ammunition, guns and carriages had to function together, this lack of co-ordination and communication between the departments that manufactured them inevitably caused problems, at a time when the Arsenal was in any case facing criticism for high levels of wasteful expenditure. An 1886 committee of enquiry, under the chairmanship of the Earl of Morley, laid bare these shortcomings and made a number of recommendations, leading among other things to the (civilian) appointment of Sir William Anderson as Director-General of Ordnance Factories (the post was retitled Chief Superintendent of Ordnance Factories, following Anderson's death, in 1899). A key recommendation was for clear managerial separation between the manufacturing departments and those responsible for inspection and approval of their products, which resulted in the establishment of a separate Inspection department under a Chief Inspector of Armaments. Testing an Armstrong Gun at the Proof Butts, 1862. In 1887 the Proof Butts were relocated once again (for the last time) further to the east. Four bays were built, to which a further four were added in 1895. Each bay consisted of a concrete box (25 ft wide by 20 ft high and 70 ft deep, two-thirds filled with sand) open towards the gun position, which was around 500 yards away. (The design was much as it had been in previous centuries, except in concrete rather than wood.) Guns were brought into position using a gantry crane, and various instruments measured velocity and other variables. Further bays, with railway mountings for the guns, would be added during the First World War, by which time the area and its operation was known as the Proof and Experimental Establishment. Recognising the increasing divergence of naval gun design from that of land artillery, part of the Ordnance Store Department was separated off in 1891 to form an independent Naval Ordnance Store Department, which (from its headquarters in the Arsenal) had oversight of what were soon termed Royal Naval Ordnance Dep√¥ts (later RN Armament Depots), including RNAD Woolwich: an extensive storage facility within the Arsenal itself. Social and sporting activities Dial Square (1718-20) lent its name to what became Arsenal Football Club In 1868 twenty workers at the Arsenal formed a food- buying association operating from a house in Plumstead and named it the Royal Arsenal Co-operative Society. Over the next 115 years the enterprise grew to half a million members across London and beyond, providing services including funerals, housing, libraries and insurance. In 1886 workers at the Arsenal formed a football club initially known as Dial Square after the workshops in the heart of the complex, playing their first game on 11 December (a 6‚Äì0 victory over Eastern Wanderers) in the Isle of Dogs. Renamed Royal Arsenal two weeks later (and also known as the 'Woolwich Reds'), the club entered the professional football league as Woolwich Arsenal in 1893 and later became known as Arsenal F.C., having moved to north London in 1913. Royal Ordnance Factories F.C. were another successful team set up by the Royal Arsenal but only lasted until 1896. 20th century: The Royal Ordnance Factories An information panel on the Thames Path indicates the one-time extent of the site over what is now Thamesmead Further enlargement was to follow, and on an unprecedented scale; by the 20th century, though, there was little room for further development on site, so the Arsenal had to expand its area eastwards outside its brick boundary wall onto the Plumstead Marshes. The eastern portion of the Arsenal site had long been used for the more dangerous manufacturing processes, as well as for proof testing. This pattern continued, with the Composition Establishment (where assembly of cartridges, fuzes and other items took place) being moved east of the canal and a lyddite factory being established by the river. Later, much of the area of Plumstead and Erith Marshes was scattered with storage magazines for explosive materials, each in its own walled, moated and earth-traversed enclosure. Manufacture of Whitehead torpedoes, begun in the Arsenal in 1871 (with the canal used as a testing run for a time) was moved to Greenock in 1911. The Royal Arsenal Gatehouse at the turn of the century Scientific research played an increasing role across the Arsenal from the early years of the 20th century: in 1902 an Experimental Establishment was set up to carry out research and investigations into explosives; (co-located with the Proof Butts, the two operations later combined to form the Proof and Experimental Establishment). At the same the staff of the War Department Chemist was expanded to strengthen its research capability; and over the next few years other small research departments emerged, focused on areas such as metallurgy, materials and mechanical technology. In 1907 these were all grouped together under a Superintendent of Research to form the Research Department. =First World War= Women munition workers stacking cartridge cases in the New Case shop at the Royal Arsenal, 1918 At its peak, during the First World War, the Royal Arsenal extended over some and employed around 80,000 people. The Royal Arsenal by then comprised the Royal Gun & Carriage Factory (which had amalgamated under Colonel Capel Lofft Holden in 1907), the Royal Laboratory (which in 1922 split to form the Royal Ammunition Factory and the Royal Filling Factory) and separate Naval Ordnance and Army Ordnance Store Departments. Other divisions included the Research and Development Department and various Inspection departments set up in the wake of the Morley Report (including that of the Chief Chemical Inspector, Woolwich, successor to the War Department Chemist). The expansion was such that in 1915 the Government built an estate of 1,298 homes - later (1925) known as the Progress Estate - at Eltham to help accommodate the workforce. In addition to the massive expansion of the Royal Ordnance Factories in the Arsenal, and of private munitions companies, other UK Government-owned National Explosives Factories and National Filling Factories were built during the First World War. All the National Factories closed at the end of the War, with only the Royal (munitions) Factories (at Woolwich, Enfield, and Waltham Abbey) remaining open through to the Second World War. It appears likely that up to the end of the First World War, the Royal Arsenal was guarded by the Metropolitan Police Force, as they also guarded the Royal Navy Cordite Factory, Holton Heath, in Dorset and the Royal Naval Armaments Depot at Priddy's Hard, Gosport up to that time. Since then the Royal Arsenal would have been guarded, until its closure, by the War Office Police Force, who became in 1971 the Ministry of Defence Police Force. =Inter-war years= During the quiet period after the end of the First World War, the Royal Arsenal built steam railway locomotives. It had an extensive standard gauge internal railway system, and this was connected to the North Kent Line just beyond Plumstead railway station. The Royal Arsenal also cast the Memorial Plaques given to the next-of-kin of deceased servicemen and servicewomen. In 1919 a committee was set up, under the chairmanship of McKinnon Wood, to report on the future organisation and role of the Royal Arsenal. One recommendation was for the establishment of an integrated Armament Design Office (up until then each factory had maintained its own, largely independent, drawing office). In 1921 a new Design Department duly came into being; based in the Central Offices building, it was a joint service body, responsible for initiating designs for guns, carriages, ammunition, small arms, tanks and transport vehicles, in close collaboration with the ordnance factories. In 1935, the Ballistics branch of the Research Department began work on developing rockets for use as anti-aircraft weapons. To provide a more remote testing location, Fort Halstead in Kent was acquired by the War Office in 1937, initially serving as an outstation of the Arsenal. This went on to become the Projectile Development Establishment (it later relocated to Aberporth in Wales for the duration of the war). The build-up to the Second World War started in the late 1930s. Abel's old Chemical Laboratory was by now too small and new Chemical Laboratories were built in 1937 on Frog Island, on a former loop in the Ordnance Canal. Staff from the Royal Arsenal helped design, and in some cases managed the construction of, many of the new Royal Ordnance Factories (ROFs) and the ROF Filling Factories. Much of the Royal Arsenal's former ordnance production was moved to these new sites, as it was considered vulnerable to aerial bombing from mainland Europe. The original plan was to replace the Royal Arsenal's Filling Factory with one at ROF Chorley and another at ROF Bridgend, but it was soon realised that many more ROFs would be needed. Just over forty had been established by the end of the war, nearly half of them Filling Factories, together with a similar number of explosives factories built and run by private companies, such as ICIs Nobels Explosives, but these private sector factories were not called ROFs. =Second World War= The Royal Arsenal was caught up in the Blitz on 7 September 1940. After several attacks, the fuze factory was destroyed and the filling factory and a light gun factory badly damaged. Explosive filling work ceased on the site, but the production of guns, shells, cartridge cases and bombs continued. In September 1940, prior to the raid, some 32,500 people worked there; but after the raid this dropped to 19,000. The numbers employed on site had increased by February 1943, with 23,000 employed, but by August 1945 were down to 15,000. 103 people were killed and 770 injured, during 25 raids, by bombs, V-1 flying bombs and V-2 rockets. The Central Offices were also damaged in the raid, prompting the removal of the Design Department from Woolwich; by 1942 both it and the Research Department were accommodated at Fort Halstead (they remained there after the war, and would later merge to become the Armament Research and Development Establishment (ARDE)). The staff of the Chemical Inspectorate, working with explosives, were evacuated in early September 1940. Shortly afterwards one of the Frog Island buildings was destroyed by bombing and another damaged. The laboratories were partially re-occupied in 1945 and fully re-occupied by 1949. =The final run-down= Building 19 was used for weapons research into the 1990s; built in 1887 on an area long known as the Mounting Ground, it was originally where guns from the Foundry were mounted on their carriages During the quiet period after the end of the Second World War, the Royal Arsenal built railway wagons, between 1945 and 1949, and constructed knitting frames for the silk stockings industry, up to 1952. Armament production then increased during the Korean War. From 1947, the British atomic weapons programme, called HER or High Explosive Research, was based at Fort Halstead in Kent (ARDE), and also at Woolwich. The first British atomic device was tested in 1952; Operation Hurricane. In 1951 the AWRE moved to RAF Aldermaston in Berkshire. ARDE, which had its origin in the Research and Design Departments of the Arsenal, retained its Woolwich outstation there until the 1980s. In 1953, a body called Royal Arsenal Estate was set up to dispose of areas of land deemed surplus to requirements. An approximately area of the site, around what is now Griffin Manor Way, was used for an industrial estate; the Ford Motor Company becoming its first tenant in 1955. Two of the roads on this estate Nathan Way and Kellner Road appear to have links with people connected with the Royal Arsenal: a Col. Nathan, at the Royal Gunpowder Factory; and, W. Kellner being the second War Office Chemist. In 1957 a merger took place which created ROF Woolwich: thus, for the first time, the various manufacturing operations on the site were united into a single Royal Ordnance Factory. Its area of operation was henceforward restricted to the western part of the Arsenal site, with everything to the east being earmarked for eventual disposal. In this guise, the factory continued to operate (with upgraded facilities) for a further ten years. The Proof and Experimental Establishment closed in 1957, though RARDE continued to make use of the proof butts until September 1969. One of a pair of 1890s additions to the Grand Store site, used after 1962 as a book store by the British Library The Woolwich Royal Ordnance Factories closed in 1967, and at the same time a large part of the eastern end of the site was sold to the Greater London Council. Much of it was used to build the new town of Thamesmead. Parts of the older (western) section of the site were leased as storage or office space to assorted public bodies (including HM Customs and Excise, the British Museum Library, the National Maritime Museum, the Property Services Agency); alongside these tenants, a variety of smaller MOD departments were accommodated, some on a temporary but others on a longer-term basis. New main gate (1985) Shortly after the closure of the Woolwich Royal Ordnance Factories, the Frog Island chemical laboratories were moved into a new building erected in 1971, in what was to become the Royal Arsenal East. The old Frog Island area was then sold off and a relocated Plumstead Bus Garage was built on part of this site. This action separated what remained of the Royal Arsenal, some , into two sites: Royal Arsenal West, at Woolwich; and, Royal Arsenal East, at Plumstead, approached via Griffin Manor Way. It also led to breaking down of parts of the 1804 brick boundary wall. Part of it near Plumstead Bus station was replaced by iron railings and chain link fencing; later the public roadway (now the A206) was also changed at the Woolwich market area and the Royal Arsenal's boundary was moved inwards so that the Beresford Gate (which had served as the main entrance to the Arsenal since 1829) became separated from the site by the A206. Its mid-1980s replacement, north of the rerouted A206, stands not far from where the original (1720s) main gateway once stood; it is graced by a pair of 18th-century gatepiers and urns saved from The Paragon on the New Kent Road (itself demolished for road-widening in the 1960s). The vast Building 22, built as central offices for the entire Arsenal site in 1908, served as headquarters for the MOD's Quality Assurance Directorates after 1967 The Royal Arsenal site retained its links to ordnance production for almost another thirty years as a number of the Ministry of Defence Procurement Executive's Quality Assurance Directorates had their headquarters offices located there. These included the Materials Quality Assurance Directorate (MQAD), which looked after materiel, including explosives and pyrotechnics; and the Quality Assurance Directorate (Ordnance) (QAD (Ord)), which looked after ordnance for the Army. MQAD was the successor of the old War Department Chemist and the Chemical Inspectorate; QAD(Ord) was the successor of the Chief Inspector of Armaments department. There was a separate Naval Ordnance Inspection Department (based in Middlegate House from 1922) that looked after the Royal Navy's interests. QAD (Ord) was based at Royal Arsenal West together with a Ministry of Defence Publications section and part of the British Library's secure storage accommodation. MQAD was based, until closure of the site at Royal Arsenal East; and all the buildings on this site were given E numbers, such as E135. Belmarsh high-security prison was built on part of Royal Arsenal East, becoming operational in 1991. =Closure= The Royal Arsenal ceased to be a military establishment in 1994. Present day New housing on the Arsenal site The sprawling Arsenal site is now one of the focal points for redevelopment in the Thames Gateway zone. Parts of the Royal Arsenal have been used to build residential and commercial buildings. Some links to its historic past have been kept, with many notable buildings in the historic original (West) site being retained in the redevelopment. Attempts to put the history of the site into context were, however, short-lived: Firepower - The Royal Artillery Museum (direct successor of the Arsenal's Repository museum), which had presented the history of artillery alongside that of the regiment, closed in 2016; and Greenwich Heritage Centre, which told the story of Woolwich including the Royal Arsenal, closed in 2018. =Residential developments= A 21st-century Energy Centre, providing electricity and hot water for the apartment blocks, replicates the design of the adjacent Land-service Gun Carriage Store (1803-4) and Erecting Shop (1887) The western part of the Royal Arsenal has now been transformed into a mixed-use development by Berkeley Homes. It comprises one of the biggest concentrations of Grade I and Grade II listed buildings converted for residential use, with more than 3,000 residents. One of the earliest developments was Royal Artillery Quays, a series of glass towers rising along the riverside built by Barratt Homes in 2003. The first phase of homes at Royal Arsenal, \\"The Armouries\\", consisted of 455 new-build apartments in a six-storey building. This was followed by \\"The Warehouse, No.1 Street\\". The development has a residents' gym, a Thames Clippers stop on site, a Streetcar car club and a 24-hour concierge facility for residents. Wellington Park provides open space and a public house, the Dial Arch, opened in June 2010 Plans have now been submitted for a new masterplan encompassing further land along the river. More than 1,700 homes already exist at Royal Arsenal Riverside, with an additional 3,700 new homes planned, along with of commercial, retail, leisure space and a 120-bedroom hotel by Holiday-Inn Express. Also included in the plans is the new Woolwich Crossrail station, which has been part-funded by Berkeley Homes. = Cultural district = In October 2018, planning permission was granted for the first phase of a multi-million pound restoration of historic buildings near the new Woolwich Crossrail station, to create a 15,000sqm complex of theatres, dance studios and places to eat. Originally this development was known as 'Woolwich Creative District' but names of the district and buildings were later put to the public vote and in July 2019 the name 'Woolwich Works' was announced =Historic architecture= A house built for Master Founder Jan Verbruggen in 1772 was converted for office use in 2010, having stood empty for a quarter of a century Several early 18th-century buildings on the site have been attributed to the architects Sir John Vanbrugh or Nicholas Hawksmoor (both of whom are known to have designed buildings for the Board of Ordnance), including the Royal Brass Foundry, Dial Arch and the Royal Military Academy; but whilst acknowledging their influence (direct or indirect), the Survey of London credits Brigadier-General Michael Richards (Surveyor-general for the Ordnance board at the time) as having played the leading part in their design. In the late-18th and early-19th centuries James Wyatt, as Architect of the Ordnance, was responsible for several buildings on the site, including the Main Guardhouse (1787), the Grand Store (1805) and Middlegate House (1807). More often than not, though, it was the on-site Engineers and Clerks of the Works who were responsible for the design of buildings and other structures within the working Arsenal.

Created by McGruder in 1996 for Hitlist.com, an early online music website, it was printed in the monthly hip hop magazine The Source in 1997. As it gained popularity, the comic strip was picked up by the Universal Press Syndicate and made its national debut on April 19, 1999. A popular and controversial strip, The Boondocks satirizes African American culture and American politics as seen through the eyes of young, black radical Huey Freeman. McGruder's syndicate said it was among the biggest launches the company ever had. McGruder sold the television and film rights for the strip to Sony Pictures Entertainment. An animated TV series based on the strip premiered on Adult Swim on November 6, 2005. McGruder launched an unsuccessful Kickstarter campaign for a live-action movie featuring The Boondocks character Uncle Ruckus in 2013. On February 6, 2019, McGruder revived the comic strip on Instagram, which were made with the help of former supervising director of the TV series, Seung Eun Kim.  Publication history  The strip debuted on Hitlist.com on February 8, 1996. It later appeared in the University of Maryland newspaper The Diamondback under editor- in-chief Jayson Blair on December 3, 1996, paying McGruder $30 per strip‚Äî$17 more than other cartoonists. McGruder ended the strip's run in The Diamondback on March 18, 1997, two weeks after the strip was omitted due to a technical error and a Diamondback staffer printed the word \\"OOPS\\" in its place without an explanation. He pulled the strip after the paper refused to run an apology.Litten, Kevin, \\"A little Huey himself\\" . The Diamondback, November 7, 2005. Retrieved December 3, 2006. (Upon the revelation in 2004 of news article fabrications by Blair, by then a reporter for The New York Times, McGruder's comic strip joined others in lampooning Blair.) The strip was rejected by six syndicates ‚Äî including the Washington Post Writers Group, Creators Syndicate, United Media, and Chronicle Features ‚Äî before finally being picked up. Many of the syndicates that rejected the strip were supportive but felt that The Boondocks was \\"too edgy.\\" An article from the summer of 1997 asserted that Universal Press Syndicate (UPS) was taking a \\"hard look\\" at the strip; UPS eventually picked it for syndication in April 1999.Parker, Lonnae O'Neal. \\"STRIP TEASE,\\" Washington Post (August 20, 1997). In Fall 2003, Boston, Massachusetts-based artist Jennifer Seng assumed art duties from McGruder. In an interview with The New Yorker, McGruder said, \\"If something had to give, it was going to be the art. I think I'm a better writer than artist.\\" Carl Jones succeeded Seng as illustrator in late 2004. In the introduction to the collection Public Enemy #2, McGruder wrote, \\"I had hired an artist to help me on some of the art duties. People think I stopped drawing the strip, but that's never been the case. To this day there has never been a single Boondocks strip that I did not personally touch‚ÄîI still obsess over the details of Huey, Riley, Caesar and Granddad. I still go over every panel. I still care what it looks like, and I always will.\\"McGrduer, Aaron. Introduction, Public Enemy #2: An All-New Boondocks Collection (Three Rivers Press, 2005). On February 28, 2006, McGruder announced that his strip would go on a six-month hiatus, starting March 27, 2006, with new installments resuming in October. Repeats of earlier strips were offered by Universal Press Syndicate in the interim. The Boondocks was syndicated to over 300 clients at its peak, but more than half substituted different features rather than publish reruns during the hiatus. On September 25, 2006, Universal Press Syndicate president Lee Salem announced that the comic would not return, saying, \\"Although Aaron McGruder has made no statement about retiring or resuming The Boondocks for print newspapers ... newspapers should not count on it coming back in the foreseeable future.\\" He added that Universal would welcome McGruder back if he chose to return. Greg Melvin, McGruder's editor at the syndicate, met with him in an unsuccessful attempt to talk the cartoonist into returning. McGruder cited his work on the Cartoon Network show among other projects as reasons for not then returning to the strip. After the strip was canceled, reruns continued to be carried by some newspapers through November 26, 2006. Reruns of the strip are available online at GoComics. In February 2019, a series of one-shot strips were published on radio personality Charlamagne tha God's Instagram page.  Description  The strip depicts Huey Freeman and his younger brother Riley, two young children who have been moved out of the West Side of Chicago with their grandfather Robert to live with him in the predominantly white fictional suburb of Woodcrest (in Maryland, as seen from the area code stated in the March 16, 2000 strip). This relates to McGruder's childhood move from Chicago to Columbia, a diverse Maryland suburb. The title word \\"boondocks\\" alludes to the isolation from primarily African-American urban life that the characters feel, and permits McGruder some philosophical distance. Huey is a politically perceptive devotee of black radical ideas of the past few decades (as explained in the May 4, 1999, strip, Huey is in fact named after Black Panther Huey P. Newton, who was named for Huey Long ) and is harshly critical of many aspects of modern black culture. For example, he is at least as hard on Vivica Fox and Cuba Gooding, Jr. at times as he is on the Bush administration. Riley, on the other hand, is enamored of gangsta rap culture and the \\"thug\\"/bling-bling lifestyle. Their grandfather Robert is a firm disciplinarian, World War II veteran, and former civil rights activist who is offended by both their values and ideas. Huey's best friend is Michael Caesar, a dreadlocked aspiring MC who agrees with many of Huey's criticisms but serves as a positive counterpoint to Huey's typically pessimistic attitude by taking a humorous approach to issues. He is also a budding comedian, although most of his humor consists of trying to play \\"yo momma\\" jokes on Huey, which always falls flat. The Freemans' neighbors are NAACP member and assistant DA Thomas DuBois (a reference both to Uncle Tom and W. E. B. Du Bois) and his white wife Sarah, also a lawyer. Their young daughter Jazmine is very insecure about her ethnic identity and is often the subject of Huey's antipathy for being out of touch with her African ancestry. The Boondocks was very political and occasionally subject to great controversy, usually sparked by the comments and behavior of its main character, Huey. The comic strip has been withheld by newspapers several times. In this respect, it is similar to Doonesbury. In particular, the principal characters often discussed racial and American socio-economic class issues. Because of its controversy and serious subject matter, many newspaper publishers either moved the strip to the op-ed section of the paper, pulled more potentially controversial strips from being published, didn't publish the strip at all, or canceled it altogether. Similar reactions have been faced by other strips, such as Doonesbury.  Main characters  * Huey Freeman ‚Äì A cynical boy who appears angry most of the time, with strident political awareness, and who sees himself as a revolutionary. Named after Huey P. Newton, co-founder of the Black Panthers, he is disturbed by the ignorance in modern-day American society and media. An observant, intelligent child, he often finds himself playing the voice of reason. Huey is fond of some conspiracy theories, and completely distrusts all authorities. * Riley Freeman ‚Äì The opposite of his older brother, Riley praises the \\"thug life,\\" and admires and emulates the rappers and thugs he sees on television. He has assigned himself the nickname \\"Esco\\", a reference to the rapper Nas christening himself \\"Nas Escobar\\" in the mid-1990s after infamous drug lord Pablo Escobar. He also formerly had the nickname \\"Young Reezy\\", but that appears to have faded away with time. Other aliases he has given himself have included \\"Osama Bin Laden\\" (chosen many months before 9/11) and Uday. Riley chose this last nickname on one of the extremely rare occasions he watched the news; he normally goes to great lengths to avoid the acquisition of knowledge. He once became upset after getting a C+ in school because he was afraid such \\"exemplary\\" grades would ruin his \\"street cred\\". Since asking for and not receiving rims for Christmas, Riley has been determined to sleigh-jack Santa Claus on Christmas Eve for the dual purpose of taking what he believes is owed to him and meting out punishment. In 2005, Riley's hair became progressively larger due to his lack of haircut; when it turned into an Afro he was able to trick people into thinking he was Huey until Grandad made him get cornrows. * Michael Caesar ‚Äì Huey's classmate and best friend who's known simply by his last name Caesar, who agrees with most of Huey's views of life. Unlike Huey, Caesar is more optimistic and cheerful, and usually jokes about whatever issue is at hand. It was Caesar's idea to find a boyfriend for Condoleezza Rice, reasoning that if she came to truly love somebody living on the planet she wouldn't be so \\"hell bent to destroy it.\\" Caesar is originally from Brooklyn and needs little prompting to vocally represent his home town. He and Huey have co-founded the newsletter the \\"Free Huey World Report\\" and the annual \\"Most Embarrassing Black People Awards.\\" * Robert Jebediah \\"Granddad\\" Freeman ‚Äì Huey and Riley's retired grandfather, a pragmatist and disciplinarian who usually sees through the shenanigans of his grandsons. Robert is known to panic at news reports, and values his own peace and comfort over the needs of others while still looking out for the children's welfare. * Thomas and Sarah Dubois ‚Äì An interracial couple in the neighborhood. They both work as lawyers. Tom is often seen talking (sometimes arguing) with Huey about current politics, while Huey tends to deride Tom for being a conformist yuppie, sometimes going so far as to sarcastically suggest that he is not really black. For a while Tom was kicked out of the house by Sarah after he called her a \\"two-timing political floozy\\" when she voted for Ralph Nader instead of Al Gore. Four years later, Tom kidnapped Nader in hopes of preventing him from taking votes away from John Kerry and costing the Democrats the 2004 Presidential Election. Huey eventually persuaded him to release Nader. * Jazmine Dubois ‚Äì Thomas and Sara's biracial daughter, who seems to like Huey, despite his general coldness toward her. She is notable for her insecurity over her biracial status. Jazmine is often portrayed as na√Øve, and is optimistic in contrast to Huey's pessimism. Early in the strip she was deliberately ambiguously colored so as to cloud the issue of whether she was white or black. It even prompted her to be directly asked by her teacher. She disappeared for roughly two years, and it was revealed she had been so frightened of terrorists that she would not leave her house. She tried to turn herself in to the FBI three times, because she thought she was helping the terrorists by being scared (having heard statements to the effect that \\"If you live in fear, the terrorists win\\"). She eventually came out because of a \\"Credible threat against her teddy bear.\\" Jazmine is insecure about her curly and voluminous hair, wishing it looked straighter, like her mother's hair. Huey's suggestion to Tom that he and Sara try \\"emphasizing the natural beauty of her African features\\" rather than trying to help her change her appearance fell on deaf ears. On one occasion when Jazmine was complaining about her \\"big and poofy\\" hair, Huey interrupted her to ask what she thought of clouds. She thought clouds were pretty, but completely missed the point Huey was trying to make. * Uncle Ruckus ‚Äì an elderly, overweight black man who is notably racist and self-loathing. He is the darkest skinned character of the cast. He first appears in December 2004 as a replacement mall Santa Claus after Riley took out the first one with a flying folding chair. He appeared again in his first Sunday feature in September 2005 as Huey and Riley's bus driver and he also admitted to working as a janitor at the school. He and Robert are sometimes seen playing checkers together between and after the aforementioned appearances. * Cindy McPhearson ‚Äì A white girl in Huey's class who appears to be utterly clueless about racial issues. She shows a fondness and curiosity for rap music, particularly Snoop Dogg.  Minor characters  * Hiro Otomo ‚Äì One of Huey's friends, a young Japanese-American DJ. Hiro only appeared in the original Diamondback version of the strip. * Principal Williams ‚Äì The principal of J. Edgar Hoover Elementary. An out-of-touch white man who prepared for the arrival of Huey and Riley by renting several blaxploitation films, mistakenly thinking of them as representative of black culture. He somehow has access to FBI files of Huey. * John Petto ‚Äì Huey, Cindy, and Caesar's white teacher, who is as clueless about how to handle them as the principal is. Old-fashioned and not used to black people, he is intimidated by Huey's intellect and has struggled trying to debate with Huey during class. *Mrs. Peterson ‚Äì Riley's teacher who has a strict rule of giving her students no special treatment, where they must pull their weight or fail. Because of this, she once failed a girl from Romania, who was a math genius, but could barely read or write. Before she started teaching, she was originally a nun, then she worked in three maximum-security prisons. Mrs. Peterson has little patience for Riley and his street behavior. * Flagee and Ribbon * Psycho Star Wars Guy  Controversies  The content of McGruder's comic strip often came under fire for being politically left-wing and occasionally risque, leading to its being published in the op-ed section of many newspapers. For example, a strip making fun of BET's rap videos (some of which rely on the sexually suggestive gyrations of female dancers) and a strip mocking Whitney Houston's drug problems and emphasizing her buttocks, were pulled out of circulation. The Boondocks garnered significant attention after the September 11, 2001 attacks with a series of strips in which Huey calls a government tipline to report Ronald Reagan for funding terrorism. Soon after, he \\"censored\\" several strips by featuring a talking patriotic yellow ribbon and a flag (named Ribbon and Flagee, respectively) instead of the usual cast. Several strips have been briefly pulled from prominent publications. For example, the \\"Condi Needs a Man\\" strip, in which Huey and his friend Caesar create a personal ad for U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, portraying her as a \\"female Darth Vader type that seeks loving mate to torture\\", resulted in The Washington Post withholding a week's worth of strips, the longest such suspension ever by the paper. However, the paper's ombudsman, Michael Getler, later sided with McGruder. The Post also declined to run \\"Can a Nigga Get a Job?\\", which had black contestants compete on a reality TV show to work for Russell Simmons, only to find that all the contestants were rude and lazy. McGruder has often attacked black conservative commentator Larry Elder in the comic strip as well as the television series. In response, Elder published an opinion piece in which he created the \\"McGruder\\", an award for statements made by black public figures that Elder considers \\"dumb\\", \\"vulgar\\", and/or \\"offensive\\".Satire TV: Politics and Comedy in the Post-Network Era, Jonathan Gray, Jeffrey Jones, Ethan Thompson.

Early life and education Aaron McGruder was born in Chicago, Illinois. When Aaron was six years old, his family moved to Columbia, Maryland, after his father accepted a job with the National Transportation Safety Board. McGruder has an older brother. McGruder attended the Jesuit school, Loyola Blakefield, from grades seven to nine. Following two years he left the school and transferred to public high school, Oakland Mills High School and the University of Maryland, from which he graduated with a degree in African American Studies. Career =The Boondocks and related work= The Boondocks began in 1996 as a webcomic on Hitlist.com, one of the first online music websites. At the time, he was also a DJ on The Soul Controllers Mix Show on WMUC. The Boondocks also briefly appeared as a comic strip in the University of Maryland's newspaper The Diamondback during Jayson Blair's tenure as editor-in-chief. McGruder signed a deal with the Universal Press Syndicate and in April 1999, the strip began appearing in 160 newspapers. The comic strip's main characters are two young African-American brothers, Huey (named after Huey P. Newton) and his younger brother and wannabe gangsta, Riley, from inner-city Chicago who are relocated to live with their grandfather in a sedate suburb. In six months, the comic strip was being distributed to more than 200 publications. Five The Boondocks collections have been published: All The Rage, Public Enemy #2, A Right To Be Hostile, Fresh for '01: You Suckaz, and Boondocks: Because I Know You Don't Read The Newspaper. An animated television series adaptation of the strip proved successful on Cartoon Network's Adult Swim. McGruder expressed interest in 2013 about filming a movie featuring The Boondocks TV series supporting character Uncle Ruckus. Gary Anthony Williams would reprise his role. McGruder set a goal of $200,000 for startup donations at uncleruckusmovie.com between January 30 through March 1, 2013, but the campaign ended with 2,667 backers and $129,963. In March 2014, The Boondocks was revived for a new season, but without McGruder's involvement as its showrunner. The first episode of the fourth season was first broadcast on April 21, 2014. In 2019, it was announced a fifth season of The Boondocks would be produced with McGruder's involvement. =Other work= Among his other projects have been the Super Deluxe variety comedy series The Super Rumble Mix Show. McGruder also developed Black Jesus, another comedy series broadcast on Adult Swim, part of Cartoon Network. With Reginald Hudlin, McGruder co-authored a graphic novel, Birth of a Nation: A Comic Novel (2004), about African Americans in East St. Louis during an election. The book's illustrations were drawn by cartoonist Kyle Baker. McGruder has developed into a public speaker on political and cultural issues. In 2010, McGruder worked as screenwriter in the final treatment of the feature film Red Tails, released in early 2012. Its story is based on the Tuskegee Airmen, a group of African American combat pilots during World War II. In August 2017, it was announced that McGruder, along with producer Will Packer, will develop a series for Amazon Video called Black America which will be based on an alternative history where emancipated black Americans receive three Southern states as reparations for slavery. The series' announcement was reportedly seen as a response to HBO's in-development alternative history series Confederate, whose plot entails a history where the Confederacy won the Civil War. Controversies McGruder's comic strip was a lightning rod for criticism since it debuted in 1999, with newspapers consigning it to editorial sections, or suspending the run of the strip altogether. Favored targets of The Boondocks include BET, Condoleezza Rice, Whitney Houston, Bill Cosby, Vivica A. Fox, and Larry Elder. McGruder has often attacked Elder in the comic strip as well as the television series. In response, Elder published an opinion piece in which he created the \\"McGruder,\\" an award for statements made by black public figures that Elder considers \\"dumb,\\" \\"vulgar,\\" and/or \\"offensive.\\" McGruder said in a 2002 keynote address at the July 12‚Äì14, 2002 H2K2 conference that he believed that President George W. Bush was involved with the September 11 attacks: He visited Cuba, meeting Fidel Castro with California Rep. Barbara Lee. Later, during a 2003 reception hosted by The Nation, McGruder offended many attendees by defiantly expressing his support for Ralph Nader's 2000 presidential bid. McGruder endured heckling and walkouts as he defended his commitment to left-wing causes, including, he claimed, calling Condoleezza Rice a \\"mass-murderer\\" to her face during the 2002 NAACP Image Awards. In 2009, Richmond, Indiana newspaper Palladium-Item reported that McGruder told a Martin Luther King Day audience at local Earlham College that then-President-elect Barack Obama was not black. McGruder released a statement insisting he was misquoted, while maintaining he remained \\"cautiously pessimistic\\" about Obama's presidency. A long-standing feud with Black Entertainment Television provided McGruder with material both for his strip and the animated series. Two episodes of the second season of The Boondocks, \\"The Hunger Strike\\" and \\"The Uncle Ruckus Reality Show\\", were not broadcast in the United States until May 29, 2020, due to possible legal action against Cartoon Network's parent company Time Warner by Viacom (BET's parent company, also the owners of Cartoon Network rival Nickelodeon and Comedy Central) because of satirization of BET; however, they resurfaced for television airplay weeks later in Canada and were included in the DVD release. (The episodes depict BET as an evil media empire plotting the destruction of black people.) Personal life By 2005 and , McGruder was residing in Los Angeles with his three dogs: Remix, Retro, and Hooligan.

Biography He was born in Paris, the second son of Albert Gaspard Grimaud, Comte d'Orsay, a Bonapartist general. His mother was Baroness Eleonore von Franquemont, an illegitimate daughter of the Duke of W√ºrttemberg and the Italian adventuress Anne Franchi. His elder brother died in infancy. In 1821, he entered the French army of the restored Bourbon monarchy (against his own Bonapartist tendencies), attending the lavish coronation of George IV of the United Kingdom in London that year (staying until 1822) and serving as a Garde du Corps of Louis XVIII. While in London he formed an acquaintance with Charles Gardiner, 1st Earl of Blessington and Marguerite, Countess of Blessington, which quickly ripened into intimacy. Scholars have speculated both that the Countess and d'Orsay had an affair, and that the infatuation was purely between the Earl and d'Orsay. While contemporaries remarked on the young man's effeminacy, the evidence for either relationship is inconclusive.Foulkes, Nick Last of the Dandies: The Scandalous Life and Escapades of Count D'Orsay, Thomas Dunne Books, 2005, p159Lovell, Ernest J. Lady Blessington's Conversations of Lord Byron, Princeton Legacy Library,1969, p39Reiman, Donald H Shelley and His Circle, 1773‚Äì1822 Vols 7‚Äì8, Harvard University Press, 1986, p442 Note 200.Matoff, Susan Marguerite, Countess of Blessington: The Turbulent Life of a Salonni√®re and Author, University of Delaware Press, 2016, p334 The following year the couple visited d'Orsay at Valence on the Rhone, and at the invitation of the earl he accompanied the party on their tour through Italy. Portrait by d'Orsay of Lord Byron's daughter, Ada, who would become known as the mathematician Ada Lovelace In the spring of 1823, he met Lord Byron at Genoa, and the published correspondence of the poet at this period contains numerous references to d'Orsay's gifts and accomplishments, and to his peculiar relationship to the Blessington family. A diary which d'Orsay had kept during his visit to London in 1821‚Äì1822 was submitted to Byron's inspection, and was much praised by him for the knowledge of men and manners and the keen faculty of observation it displayed. On 1 December 1827, Count d'Orsay married Lady Harriet Gardiner, a girl of fifteen, the daughter of Lord Blessington by his previous wife. The union, if it rendered his connection with the Blessington family less ostensibly equivocal than before, was in other respects an unhappy one, and a legal separation took place in 1838, at which Lady Harriet paid over ¬£100,000 to his creditors (though even this did not cover all his debts) in exchange for d'Orsay giving up all claims to the Blessington estate. James Fraser. After the death of Lord Blessington, which occurred in 1829, the widowed countess returned to England, accompanied by d'Orsay, and her home, first at Seamore Place, then at Gore House, soon became a resort of the fashionable literary and artistic society of London, which found an equal attraction in host and in hostess. The count's charming manner, brilliant wit, and artistic faculty were accompanied by benevolent moral qualities, which endeared him to all his associates. His skill as a painter and sculptor was shown in numerous portraits and statuettes representing his friends, which were marked by great vigour and truthfulness, if wanting in the finish that can only be reached by persistent discipline. It was at Gore House that d'Orsay met Benjamin Disraeli and Edward Bulwer-Lytton, themselves young men of fashion who dabbled in the arts. D'Orsay and Disraeli were good friends in the 1830s‚Äìto the point that Disraeli asked d'Orsay to be his second, when it appeared that Disraeli would fight a duel with Morgan O'Connell, the son of Irish agitator Daniel O'Connell. D'Orsay declined, on the grounds of being a foreigner, and Disraeli went with Henry Baillie, a mutual friend. The character of Count Alcibiades de Mirabel in Disraeli's novel Henrietta Temple was modeled on d'Orsay, to whom the book was dedicated. The comte's and Marguerite's pyramidal tomb at Chambourcy (Yvelines, France) Count d'Orsay had been from his youth a zealous Bonapartist, and one of the most frequent guests at Gore House was Prince Louis-Napoleon Bonaparte. In 1849 the count went bankrupt, and the establishment at Gore House being broken up, he went to Paris. Lady Blessington sold almost all her possessions and followed him there, but died a few weeks after her arrival, leaving him heartbroken. He endeavoured to provide for himself by painting portraits. He was deep in the counsels of the prince-president (who had also returned to Paris from exile, and been elected president the year before d'Orsay arrived), but relations between them were less cordial after Louis-Napol√©on's 1851 coup d'√©tat (the French Parliament is dissolved), of which the count had expressed his strong disapproval. Reluctant to entrust d'Orsay with any affairs of state, prince-president Louis-Napoleon finally offered him the position of surintendant of the Beaux-Arts School. Within a few months of the appointment, however, D'Orsay contracted a spinal infection, of which he died on 4 August 1852 in the house of his sister Ida, duchesse de Gramont, at Chambourcy, just a few days after his appointment had been officially announced. He had designed a pyramidal grey stone tomb for Lady Blessington at Chambourcy, and he too was buried in it, with the not yet Emperor Napoleon III among the mourners at the funeral. Cultural references Eustace Tilley, the mascot of The New Yorker magazine, was based on an engraving of D'Orsay, interpreted by house cartoonist and art director Rea Irvin.

For a fibre bundle F with structure group G, the transition functions of the fibre (i.e., the cocycle) in an overlap of two coordinate systems UŒ± and UŒ≤ are given as a G-valued function gŒ±Œ≤ on UŒ±‚à©UŒ≤. One may then construct a fibre bundle F‚Ä≤ as a new fibre bundle having the same transition functions, but possibly a different fibre. An example A simple case comes with the M√∂bius strip, for which G is the cyclic group of order 2, \\\\mathbb{Z}_2. We can take as F any of: the real number line \\\\mathbb{R}, the interval [-1,\\\\ 1], the real number line less the point 0, or the two-point set \\\\\\\\{-1,\\\\ 1\\\\\\\\}. The action of G on these (the non- identity element acting as x\\\\ \\\\rightarrow\\\\ -x in each case) is comparable, in an intuitive sense. We could say that more formally in terms of gluing two rectangles [-1,\\\\ 1] \\\\times I and [-1,\\\\ 1] \\\\times J together: what we really need is the data to identify [-1,\\\\ 1] to itself directly at one end, and with the twist over at the other end. This data can be written down as a patching function, with values in G. The associated bundle construction is just the observation that this data does just as well for \\\\\\\\{-1,\\\\ 1\\\\\\\\} as for [-1,\\\\ 1]. Construction In general it is enough to explain the transition from a bundle with fiber F, on which G acts, to the associated principal bundle (namely the bundle where the fiber is G, considered to act by translation on itself). For then we can go from F_1 to F_2, via the principal bundle. Details in terms of data for an open covering are given as a case of descent. This section is organized as follows. We first introduce the general procedure for producing an associated bundle, with specified fibre, from a given fibre bundle. This then specializes to the case when the specified fibre is a principal homogeneous space for the left action of the group on itself, yielding the associated principal bundle. If, in addition, a right action is given on the fibre of the principal bundle, we describe how to construct any associated bundle by means of a fibre product construction.All of these constructions are due to Ehresmann (1941-3). Attributed by Steenrod (1951) page 36 =Associated bundles in general= Let œÄ : E -> X be a fiber bundle over a topological space X with structure group G and typical fibre F. By definition, there is a left action of G (as a transformation group) on the fibre F. Suppose furthermore that this action is effective.Effectiveness is a common requirement for fibre bundles; see Steenrod (1951). In particular, this condition is necessary to ensure the existence and uniqueness of the principal bundle associated with E. There is a local trivialization of the bundle E consisting of an open cover Ui of X, and a collection of fibre maps :œÜi : œÄ‚àí1(Ui) -> Ui √ó F such that the transition maps are given by elements of G. More precisely, there are continuous functions gij : (Ui ‚à© Uj) -> G such that :œàij(u,f) := œÜi o œÜj‚àí1(u,f) = (u,gij(u)f) for each (u,f) ‚àà (Ui ‚à© Uj) √ó F. Now let F‚Ä≤ be a specified topological space, equipped with a continuous left action of G. Then the bundle associated with E with fibre F‚Ä≤ is a bundle E‚Ä≤ with a local trivialization subordinate to the cover Ui whose transition functions are given by :œà‚Ä≤ij(u,f‚Ä≤) = (u, gij(u) f‚Ä≤) for (u,f‚Ä≤) ‚àà(Ui ‚à© Uj) √ó F‚Ä≤ where the G-valued functions gij(u) are the same as those obtained from the local trivialization of the original bundle E. This definition clearly respects the cocycle condition on the transition functions, since in each case they are given by the same system of G-valued functions. (Using another local trivialization, and passing to a common refinement if necessary, the gij transform via the same coboundary.) Hence, by the fiber bundle construction theorem, this produces a fibre bundle E‚Ä≤ with fibre F‚Ä≤ as claimed. =Principal bundle associated with a fibre bundle= As before, suppose that E is a fibre bundle with structure group G. In the special case when G has a free and transitive left action on F‚Ä≤, so that F‚Ä≤ is a principal homogeneous space for the left action of G on itself, then the associated bundle E‚Ä≤ is called the principal G-bundle associated with the fibre bundle E. If, moreover, the new fibre F‚Ä≤ is identified with G (so that F‚Ä≤ inherits a right action of G as well as a left action), then the right action of G on F‚Ä≤ induces a right action of G on E‚Ä≤. With this choice of identification, E‚Ä≤ becomes a principal bundle in the usual sense. Note that, although there is no canonical way to specify a right action on a principal homogeneous space for G, any two such actions will yield principal bundles which have the same underlying fibre bundle with structure group G (since this comes from the left action of G), and isomorphic as G-spaces in the sense that there is a globally defined G-valued function relating the two. In this way, a principal G-bundle equipped with a right action is often thought of as part of the data specifying a fibre bundle with structure group G, since to a fibre bundle one may construct the principal bundle via the associated bundle construction. One may then, as in the next section, go the other way around and derive any fibre bundle by using a fibre product. =Fiber bundle associated with a principal bundle= Let œÄ : P ‚Üí X be a principal G-bundle and let œÅ : G ‚Üí Homeo(F) be a continuous left action of G on a space F (in the smooth category, we should have a smooth action on a smooth manifold). Without loss of generality, we can take this action to be effective. Define a right action of G on P √ó F viaHusemoller, Dale (1994), p. 45.Sharpe, R. W. (1997), p. 37. :(p,f)\\\\cdot g = (p\\\\cdot g, \\\\rho(g^{-1})f)\\\\, . We then identify by this action to obtain the space E = P √óœÅ F = (P √ó F) /G. Denote the equivalence class of (p,f) by [p,f]. Note that :[p\\\\cdot g,f] = [p,\\\\rho(g)f] \\\\mbox{ for all } g\\\\in G. Define a projection map œÄœÅ : E ‚Üí X by œÄœÅ([p,f]) = œÄ(p). Note that this is well-defined. Then œÄœÅ : E ‚Üí X is a fiber bundle with fiber F and structure group G. The transition functions are given by œÅ(tij) where tij are the transition functions of the principal bundle P. Reduction of the structure group The companion concept to associated bundles is the reduction of the structure group of a G-bundle B. We ask whether there is an H-bundle C, such that the associated G-bundle is B, up to isomorphism. More concretely, this asks whether the transition data for B can consistently be written with values in H. In other words, we ask to identify the image of the associated bundle mapping (which is actually a functor). =Examples of reduction= Examples for vector bundles include: the introduction of a metric resulting in reduction of the structure group from a general linear group GL(n) to an orthogonal group O(n); and the existence of complex structure on a real bundle resulting in reduction of the structure group from real general linear group GL(2n,R) to complex general linear group GL(n,C). Another important case is finding a decomposition of a vector bundle V of rank n as a Whitney sum (direct sum) of sub-bundles of rank k and n-k, resulting in reduction of the structure group from GL(n,R) to GL(k,R) √ó GL(n-k,R). One can also express the condition for a foliation to be defined as a reduction of the tangent bundle to a block matrix subgroup - but here the reduction is only a necessary condition, there being an integrability condition so that the Frobenius theorem applies.

He is a failed student at the Unseen University for wizards in Ankh-Morpork, and is often described by scholars as \\"the magical equivalent to the number zero\\". He spends most of his time running away from bands of people who want to kill him for various reasons. The fact that he's still alive and running is explained in that, although he was born with a wizard's spirit, he has the body of a long-distance sprinter. Rincewind is also renowned for being able to solve minor problems by turning them into major disasters. His unique \\"skill\\" is implied to be due to being the chosen one of \\"The Lady\\", the anthropomorphic personification of luck (both good and bad). Rincewind was portrayed by David Jason in the film adaption of The Colour of Magic and Pratchett said in an interview that he unwittingly took Rincewind's name from \\"Churm Rincewind\\", a fictitious person referred to in early \\"'Beachcomber\\" columns in the Daily Express.

He is recruited for this job because he is the only one who can communicate with Twoflower (they use Be-Trobi as a lingua franca). He and Twoflower wander around for quite a while, and get chased by everything from the personification of Death to a Lovecraftian creature named Bel-Shamharoth. Even after Rincewind and Twoflower part ways at the end of The Light Fantastic‚Äîwith Twoflower giving Rincewind his sapient-pearwood Luggage in the process‚ÄîRincewind's adventures continue to see him being chased across various regions of the Discworld in spite of, or often driven by, his desire to find somewhere he can relish boredom in peace and quiet. During the events of The Last Hero, Rincewind states that he does not wish to volunteer for a dangerous mission; when he is asked to explain himself, he states that he's merely refusing for appearances sake, because, as someone is bound to nominate him for the upcoming mission eventually, even if he refuses, somehow events will conspire against him and he'll end up going on the mission anyway as he attempts to escape. In Raising Steam, Rincewind is mentioned in footnotes, which refer to him as a professor at the university, studying the effects of different flowers on the nervous system. =In other media= Rincewind is the main character of the text adventure The Colour of Magic, which was based on the book of the same name. Rincewind is also the player character of the 1995 Discworld video game. After a dragon is spotted in Ankh-Morpork, Unseen University's archchancellor sends Rincewind to find out the source of the trouble. In the sequel to this game, Discworld II: Missing Presumed...!?, Death disappears and the archchancellor puts Rincewind in charge of finding him and convincing him to get back to work. In both of the games, Rincewind is voiced by Eric Idle. Character Rincewind has the ability to pick up the essentials of foreign languages quickly and fluency only slightly less quickly, and appears to have the ability to blend in with any situation. During The Colour of Magic, when he was projected into a universe that may or may not have been our own, he assumed the role of a nuclear physicist. In keeping with his nature, the role was as a physicist who specialized in the 'breakaway oxidation phenomena' of certain reactors‚Äîor, to put another way, what happens when those reactors caught fire (Terry Pratchett served as the press officer for several nuclear power plants before he became a full-time writer). Rincewind speculated on the nature of science, expressing in The Colour of Magic the hope that there was something \\"better than magic\\" in the world, and speculated on the possibility of harnessing lightning, for which he was mocked by \\"sensible\\" Discworld citizens. Rincewind is also fairly streetwise. He is often depicted as a harsh critic of the selected stupidities surrounding him, even though he can't help but comply with whatever absurdity that arises. For example, in the computer games starring him, he consistently spotted the ludicrous events around him and would then make jokes and puns to the unaware participants. He also seems to display, despite his apparent failure as a wizard, a fairly extensive magical knowledge, recognizing various spells, magical artefacts and concepts throughout his escapades. Some of Rincewind's talents once stemmed from a semi-sentient and highly destructive spell that had lodged itself inside his mind and scared off all other spells (mentioned in The Colour of Magic and The Light Fantastic; though it must be stated that even without the spell's interference he was still an extremely incompetent wizard). The spell occasionally tries to make itself heard whenever Rincewind is going through a stressful time; as he was falling to his near-death, he said the first seven out of eight words of the spell. In Sourcery and Unseen Academicals Rincewind claims that he never knew his mother as she ran away before he was born. Rincewind has received several titles during his stay at the Unseen University; some of them because nobody else wants them, others to keep him busy doing work unrelated to magic.The Science of Discworld These titles and their accompanying tenure include the condition that he cannot have any salary, influence, or opinions. They do, however, include meals, his laundry done, and (as a result of all the impressive- sounding but essentially meaningless titles that have been bestowed upon him) up to eight buckets of coal a day during the entire year. Concept and creation Pratchett said that Rincewind's job is \\"to meet more interesting people\\", saying that there is not much he can do with a character who's a coward and doesn't care who knows it. Pratchett noted that one of his major problems was that he has a \\"lack of an inner monologue\\". Supporting characters =Twoflower= Twoflower is a native of the Agatean Empire, on the Counterweight Continent, where he works as an \\"inn-sewer-ants\\" clerk, and is the first tourist ever on the Discworld. After his return, he wrote \\"What I Did on My Holidays\\". He is described as having \\"four eyes\\" by a beggar at the docks early in the events in The Colour of Magic, who \\"found himself looking up into a face with four eyes,\\" implying he actually wears glasses, although Josh Kirby's dust jacket illustrations for The Colour of Magic and The Light Fantastic shows him with four eyes. He also wears dentures, a concept that inspires Cohen the Barbarian to have a set made for himself made out of trolls' teeth, which are made of diamond. His adventures begin in The Colour of Magic, when he decides to visit the city of Ankh-Morpork, where he meets the inept wizard Rincewind whom he hires as a guide. Throughout the first two novels, he is followed by the Luggage, a homicidally vicious travel chest which moves on hundreds of little legs, carrying his belongings. Twoflower is the optimistic but naive tourist. He often runs into danger, being certain that nothing bad will happen to him since he is not involved. He also believes in the fundamental goodness of human nature and that all problems can be resolved, if all parties show good will and cooperate. Rincewind, of course, remains immovably convinced that Twoflower's IQ is comparable to that of a pigeon. He has no understanding of the Agatean/Ankh-Morpork exchange rate and often overpays, primarily because even the smallest denomination of Agatean coin is made of pure gold, and, thus, often pays for small items and minor services with enough wealth to buy a sizable fraction of the city. However, he introduces the concept of insurance to Ankh-Morpork (in particular to the landlord of the Broken Drum, which would prove fortunate as the city and tavern were both consumed by flame (albeit not entirely by accident)‚Äîthe policy allowed the Broken Drum to be rebuilt as the Mended Drum.) Twoflower also has a rich imagination as he is able to summon a dragon through his mind. The dragon, which he calls \\"Ninereeds\\", is very obedient to him. With the help of Ninereeds he rescues Rincewind and escapes the Wyrmberg. The book relating his journey across the Discworld is considered a revolutionary pamphlet in his native land. At the end of the novel Interesting Times he was promoted to the rank of Grand Vizier of the Empire, under Emperor Cohen. It is not known if he still holds the position following Cohen's disappearance (as told in The Last Hero) but the Discworld Atlas states that the Agatean Empire has, in that time, become the 'People's Beneficial Republic of Agatea', headed by a Chairman. He appears in the books The Colour of Magic, The Light Fantastic and Interesting Times and in the computer game NetHack as the quest leader for the tourist class. He is played by Sean Astin (alongside David Jason as Rincewind) in the two-part television adaptation. =The Luggage= The Luggage is a large chest that follows Rincewind literally wherever he goes‚Äîeven onto Roundworld, which Rincewind initially only visited virtually. It is made of sapient pearwood (a magical, intelligent plant that is nearly extinct, impervious to magic, and only grows in a few places outside the Agatean Empire, generally on sites of very old magic). It can produce hundreds of little legs protruding from its underside and can move very fast if the need arises. It has been described as \\"half suitcase, half homicidal maniac\\".(Sourcery paperback p22) Its function is to act as both a luggage carrier and bodyguard for its owner, against whom no threatening motion should be made. The Luggage is fiercely defensive of its owner, and is generally homicidal in nature, killing or eating several people and monsters and destroying various ships, walls, doors, geographic features, and other obstacles throughout the series. Its mouth contains \\"lots of big square teeth, white as sycamore, and a pulsating tongue, red as mahogany\\". The inside area of The Luggage does not appear to be constrained by its external dimensions, and contains many conveniences: even when it has just devoured a monster, the next time it opens the owner will find his underwear, neatly pressed and smelling slightly of lavender. It is unknown exactly what happens to anyone it 'eats'. One of the most notable features of The Luggage is its ability to follow its current owner anywhere, including such places as inside its owner's mind, off the edge of the Disc, Death's Domain, inside the Octavo, the Dungeon Dimensions, and even (literally) to Hell and back. Like all luggage, it's constantly getting lost and having to track its owner down. It has only one way of overcoming obstacles, and that is by simply ignoring them and smashing a hole through them‚Äîincluding a wall to a magic shop that had since relocated to another city by magical means. The Luggage first appears as the property of Twoflower, the Disc's first tourist in The Colour of Magic (at a bar no less, where all the patrons decide to stare at their drinks after witnessing the arrival of the Luggage). When Twoflower returns home in The Light Fantastic he gives the luggage to Rincewind, and it follows him through several sequels. Twoflower says he got it by asking for \\"a travelling trunk\\" at one of about a dozen magical shops‚Äîwhich are not limited by the constraints of time and space, to their owners' dismay‚Äîwhich is exactly what he got. According to The Light Fantastic, this chain of stores was born when an impatient sorcerer was served rather poorly. When Rincewind eventually visits the Counterweight Continent, Twoflower's home, he finds many items similar to Luggage travelling with their masters. Although the luggage and those other items like it are constructed items, it is implied in The Last Continent that Rincewind's luggage, having learned a few things on its travels, somehow manages to successfully mate with a similar traveling container and produce offspring. Twoflower says about The Luggage in Interesting Times that \\"I always thought there was something rather twisted about it.\\" Pratchett says (at the beginning of Sourcery) that he got the idea for the Luggage when he saw a tartan suitcase with dozens of little wheels moving as though it had a mind of its own while an American tourist pulled it along. However, he has also stated (in The Art of Discworld) that it was loosely based on an idea from a roleplaying game he had designed‚Äîthat being of a similar item that would do only and exactly as it was told. Students at Saarland University have realized a prototype of the chest, which, however, has so far only been able to follow its owner on its own.https://web.archive.org/web/20200419175008/https://www.uni- saarland.de/universitaet/aktuell/artikel/nr/10486.html The popular MMORPG World of Warcraft includes a battle pet called the Creepy Crate, which is based on the Luggage. It is a large wooden crate that follows its owner about, eats nearby small animals, and occasionally has eyes and a large pink tongue. =Hrun the Barbarian= Appeared in The Colour of Magic. Hrun is an archetypal fantasy barbarian: hulking and musclebound yet slow-witted, with very little dress sense, battle-prone, alcoholic and fond of virgins. Hrun owns a magic talking sword, Kring, which he stole following a battle, and lived to greatly regret it due to the sword's talkativeness. He meets Rincewind in Bel-Shamharoth's lair, and aids his escape. Upon nearing the Wyrmberg of the Dragonriders, he is captured by the curvaceous Liessa Dragonbidder and her dragon riders. Liessa's plan was to use Hrun to wrest the rulership of the Wyrmberg from her rival brothers and then become queen, Hrun's payment being her hand in marriage. Hrun agrees to the plan and successfully defeats Liessa's brothers with his bare hands, but he refuses to kill them as they are unconscious. Killing unconscious people would have been damaging to his reputation. Liessa agrees to resort to banishing her brothers. In a scene unusually erotic for a Discworld book, Liessa strips naked before Hrun to see if his desire for her will be strong enough for their relationship to work. Before he can accept the \\"proposal\\", Rincewind and Twoflower riding on Twoflower's conjured dragon Ninereeds, snatch up Hrun in a rescue attempt and fly away with him. Hrun is extremely displeased at the event, having been denied both lordship and intimate contact with Liessa through their actions. But Hrun does not need to be angry for long: when Twoflower faints, his dragon, having existed only through his willpower, disappears, causing all three passengers to fall through the air. Liessa catches Hrun on her own dragon, and the couple share a passionate kiss. Hrun's fate after this is unknown. In Interesting Times, it is revealed that he eventually became the commander of the Watch in an unnamed city. This could also imply that Hrun eventually split up with Liessa. Hrun's separation from Liessa and his enrollment in a Watch unit are not altogether surprising: later on in the Discworld timeline, barbarians and mythical creatures are dying out due to the modernisation of the world, leading them to either fade from existence or have to enroll into society. Hrun also has some fame, because Twoflower gets very excited at the prospect of meeting Hrun the Barbarian. =Liessa Dragonlady= Daughter of Geicha the First, lord of the Wyrmberg, and leader of the dragonriders. An archetypal fantasy barbarian woman, she has red chestnut hair, is curvaceous and wears almost nothing except for a chainmail harness. Liessa's ambitions are high: having poisoned her father, the traditional means of succession in her family, she is hindered by the fact that as a woman, she cannot become lord of the Wyrmberg and faces intense rivalry from her two brothers. There is however a loophole: by marrying a man who would then become lord of the Wyrmberg through allegiance, she could act as the real power behind the throne. When she foments this plan, Rincewind, Twoflower and Hrun the Barbarian are passing close to her mountain country. Liessa is interested in Hrun, for as a strong but slow-witted warrior, she could use him to defeat her brothers and then place him as a puppet lord. Having kidnapped Hrun and Twoflower (for whom she expresses no interest and has locked away), she tests Hrun by trying to stab him in his sleep. Hrun grabs her wrist and almost breaks it. Convinced of the fellow barbarian's agility, she tells him that he may marry her if he defeats her brothers. Hrun accepts and succeeds in carrying out her orders, but refuses to definitely kill her siblings. Liessa agrees to banishing them instead and tells Hrun tenderly (calling him by name for the first time) that she did not expect such mercy from him. It seems at that point that Liessa is developing genuine feelings for her husband-to-be. But Liessa still has one more trial in store for him: she strips till she is naked, so as to see how much passion he truly has for her. Before the couple can embark onto anything intimate however, Hrun is snatched away by Rincewind and Twoflower riding Twoflower's dragon Ninereeds. In desperation, Liessa summons her own dragon to pursue them (still naked, as Pratchett makes a point of). Ninereeds nearly outruns her but vanishes when Twoflower loses consciousness, causing everyone riding him to fall. Liessa abandons Rincewind and Twoflower to their fate and catches Hrun on her dragon, and the two share a passionate kiss. Liessa is never seen or mentioned after this. She appears in The Colour of Magic. In the Easter 2008 Sky One adaptation of The Colour of Magic, she is played by Karen David. =Eric Thursley= A fourteen-year-old demonologist and title character in Eric. He lives at 13 Midden Lane, Pseudopolis. Eric inherited most of his demonology books and paraphernalia (as well as a talking parrot) from his grandfather; his parents, apparently convinced that their son was destined to become a gifted demonologist, allowed him free rein over his grandfather's workshop. Eric was relatively unsuccessful as a demonologist until, with some unknown assistance, he managed to summon Rincewind from the Dungeon Dimensions. After a journey across Time to such diverse locations as the Klatchian rainforests, the Tsortean War, and the beginning of the universe (during which he became somewhat more likeable), Eric was last shown escaping from Hell with Rincewind, and it is unknown what happened to him afterwards. =Lavaeolus= The Discworld equivalent of Odysseus. He was the finest military mind on the continent of Klatch. His genius consisted of realising that, if there has to be a war, the aim should be to defeat the enemy as quickly and with as little bloodshed as possible‚Äîa concept so breathtaking in its originality that few other military minds have been able to grasp it, and it shows what happens when you take the conduct of a war away from skilled soldiers. He was a hero of the Tsortean Wars, which he ended by bribing a cleaner to show him a secret passage into the citadel of Tsort. He is also known for having undergone a long and perilous journey home after the war, much like his Roundworld equivalent. It is possible that he is the ancestor of Rincewind as his name means \\"rinser of winds.\\" He appeared in Eric and is briefly mentioned in Pyramids. =Cohen the Barbarian= Ghenghiz Cohen, known as Cohen the Barbarian, is a hero in the classical sense, i.e., a professional thief, brawler, and ravisher of women. His name and character are an obvious echo of Robert E. Howard's Conan the Barbarian and Genghis Khan, and of the common Jewish surname Cohen. The man who introduced the world to the concept of \\"wholesale\\" destruction, Cohen is the Discworld's greatest warrior hero, renowned across the Disc for his exploits rescuing maidens, destroying the mad high priestsNote that \\"Cohen\\" is a transcription of the Hebrew word ◊õ◊î◊ü which means \\"priest\\". of dark cults, looting ancient ruins, and so on. On his first appearance in the series he is already an old man, but still tough enough to handle anything the world can throw at him; his opponents often underestimate him because of his age, realizing too late that a man who does for a living what Cohen does and nevertheless survives to such an age must be very good at it indeed. Cohen does not know how old he is exactly. In The Light Fantastic, he says he is 87 years old, but in others he estimates that he is between 90 and 95 years of age. Cohen is described as a skinny old man, with a long white beard hanging down below his loincloth, and wearing a patch over one eye. His most distinguishing feature, however, is his smile‚Äîhis unique dentures are made out of troll teeth, which consist of pure diamond and were inspired when Twoflower showed him his own (more typical) set. The greatest problems now facing Cohen come from outliving the heroic age and finding himself in a civilized modern world where great battles and astonishing rescues happen rarely except in stories‚Äîwhich is ironic given that the Discworld runs on narrative. One of the rare Discworld short stories, \\"Troll Bridge\\", tells of Cohen setting out to slay a troll, only to end up reminiscing with it about the good old days when things were black and white and everyone respected the traditions. Part of Cohen's danger to normal people is that as a barbarian hero he has extreme problems interpreting such things as empty bravado‚Äîas a man of his word, he naturally assumes that anyone else saying something like 'I would rather die than betray the Emperor' fully means it. This led to the deaths of several guards and courtiers in the Agatean Empire before everyone wised up. In Interesting Times Cohen became Emperor of the Agatean Empire, having conquered it with his allies, the Silver Horde (see below). This was intended to be a sort of retirement plan, but Cohen and his chums became bored and then abandoned the Empire in The Last Hero, in which Cohen decides to express his displeasure with the modern world by \\"returning fire to the gods, with interest\\". After the rather unsuccessful attempt, he and his friends escaped on the backs of horses belonging to the Valkyries and rode into the sky, seeking to explore the outside of space. His current whereabouts are unknown. Given a barbarian hero's attractiveness to nubile young maidens, Cohen has quite a lot of children; in The Last Hero he mentions casually that he has dozens. The only one mentioned by name in the novels is Conina, who appears in Sourcery. She wishes to be a hairdresser, but Discworld-style genetics keep getting in the way, causing her to instinctively kill people who threaten her. She was last seen in an amorous relationship with Nijel the Destroyer. She says she knew Cohen and that he took an interest in her education‚Äîsuch as setting a length of corridor with a variety of traps for some heroic training. In The Light Fantastic, Cohen helps the other two protagonists, Rincewind and Twoflower, save a seventeen-year-old girl named Bethan, who was to be offered as a sacrifice. They fall in love, mainly owing to Bethan's patience and skill at curing Cohen's back problems, and decide to get married, despite Rincewind's apprehensions about their age difference. At the end of the book they are not present, and it is assumed that they have left for their marriage. Cohen does mention that he has been married before, however. Actor David Bradley played Cohen in the 2008 The Colour of Magic miniseries. The miniseries was produced by The Mob Film Company and Sky One and it combined both The Colour of Magic and The Light Fantastic. It was broadcast on Easter Sunday and Monday 2008. In the miniseries, rather than vanishing, Bethan and Cohen show up at the docks, already married, to bid Twoflower goodbye as he heads back home. Twoflower supplies them with a wedding present of a box of Agatean money, which he believes to be inconsequential but which Rincewind comments, out of earshot of Twoflower, would buy them a small kingdom. =The Silver Horde= The Silver Horde is a group of barbarian heroes, featured in Interesting Times and The Last Hero, who see Cohen the Barbarian as their leader. The name of the group is a play on the Golden Horde and a reference to the age of its members. They are Truckle the Uncivil, Caleb the Ripper, Mad Hamish, Boy Willie, Old Vincent (both relative terms, presumably), and Mr. Ronald Saveloy (geography teacher turned barbarian adventurer), or, as the Horde call him, Teach. They are rumoured to be \\"the legendary Seven Indestructible Sages\\", previously unheard of, but \\"Perhaps legends have to start somewhere\\". In Interesting Times, The Silver Horde aid Cohen in his invasion of the Agatean Empire in an effort to steal something, which is hinted at but not revealed until the end to be the Empire itself. They also have a hand in overthrowing the current Emperor (a cruel tyrant who isn't \\"simply at Death's door but well inside the hallway, admiring the carpet and commenting on the hatstand\\"). A main point of the plot is Teach's attempt to civilise the Horde, a difficult task since \\"every one of them saw a book as either a lavatorial accessory or a set of portable firelighters and thought that hygiene was a greeting\\". With Cohen crowned Emperor, the Horde live like royalty, all except Teach, who dies in the final battle of the novel after proving his barbarian credentials beyond all doubt with a berserker-like rage that amazes even his cohorts. As of The Last Hero, Old Vincent is also dead, having choked on a cucumber (or possibly a concubine‚Äîthere's some confusion on this point in the dialogue). The Horde sets off to return fire to the gods in a glorious last adventure, but eventually realize that this would destroy the Disc and, it is implied (if not explicitly stated), give their lives to save everyone else. =Conina= The daughter of Cohen the Barbarian and a temple dancer. From her mother she inherited gold-tinged skin, white-blond hair, a voice that can make \\"Good morning\\" sound like an invitation to bed, and a very good figure. From her father, she inherited sinews you could moor a ship with, muscles as solid as a plank, and reflexes like a snake on a hot tin roof (from relevant pieces of description in Sourcery). She also acquired from Cohen suitable heroic instincts: a strong urge to immediately attack and kill anyone making a threatening move on her, an ability to use anything as a deadly weapon, and an ability to steal anything regardless of the safeguards (such as having been swallowed). During the book, Rincewind develops something of a crush on her, though it never goes further than that. By the end of Sourcery, she had fallen in love with Nijel the Destroyer, who could be considered her polar opposite in that he wants to be a barbarian hero but is very bad at it. =Nijel the Destroyer= Nijel the Destroyer, son of Harebut the Provision Merchant, is a would-be barbarian hero, appearing in Sourcery. Nijel meets Rincewind in a snake pit and they escape together. He falls in love with Conina (a barbarian heroine who wants to be a hairdresser but can't due to her genes) at first sight, and she with him. He is a clerk who wants to be a barbarian hero and is currently half-way through a book on the subject, which includes a table of wandering monsters and tends to resemble a Dungeons & Dragons manual. In addition to the standard loincloth, Nijel wears woollen long underwear‚Äîhis mother insisted. His battle cry is 'Erm, excuse me...' =Herrena the Henna- Haired Harridan= An ex-opponent of Cohen, and sometime lover. Ofttimes beset by other barbarians, and even more often tearing across the Disc-scape as an aside. Inspired by Red Sonja of Conan fame. She has a prominent role in The Light Fantastic and a small cameo in Eric. =Evil Harry Dread= Evil Harry Dread is the villainous counterpart to Cohen the Barbarian; an old fashioned heroic fantasy type annoyed with how the Discworld has changed (nowadays, modern heroes always block his escape tunnel before confronting him). He's proud of being a Dark Lord, and the heroes don't bear him any grudges; after all, he always lets them win and, in return, they always let him escape (see the Evil Overlord List for the opposite of this concept). Evil Harry Dread always makes an effort to adhere to the 'rules': he intentionally hires stupid henchmen, invests in helmets that cover the whole face (thus making it easy for a Hero to disguise himself) and places Heroes in overly contrived, easily escapable deathtraps. He appears in The Last Hero, where he joins the Silver Horde on their quest to 'return fire to the gods' by blowing up the mountain. Harry ends up betraying the Horde (as a villain, it is his job), though when the horde confronts him about his betrayal they praise him for still being a reliable Dark Lord even at the end. He was last seen descending from Cori Celesti with the Silver Horde's bard, a man they had kidnapped in order to chronicle the quest. Earlier in the aforementioned book it is stated by Cohen that Harry began with \\"two lads and his Shed Of Doom\\". Reception and legacy In her review of Night Watch, A. S. Byatt noted the lack of recent appearances of Rincewind and the more grim presentation of the Witches and Ankh-Morpork as signs of Pratchett's imagination getting darker. Release 2.1 of VLC media player is named Rincewind with some previous releases such as release 1.1.0 being codenamed \\"The Luggage\\". and release 2.0 being named \\"Twoflower\\", the character that gave The Luggage to Rincewind (in The Light Fantastic). Rincewind and Discworld witch Nanny Ogg appeared on first-class Royal Mail stamps in March 2011. The issue included wizards, witches and enchanters from British fiction, and also included characters from the Arthurian Legend, from J. K. Rowling's Harry Potter series, and from the Narnia series of C. S. Lewis. Paul Whitelaw, writing for The Scotsman, felt that David Jason was \\"clearly several decades too old\\" to be Rincewind in the film adaption of The Colour of Magic. The Cretaceous gymnosperm species Phoenicopsis rincewindii is named after Rincewind.Watson, J., Lydon, S. J. and Harrison, N. A.

In music, a canon is a contrapuntal (counterpoint-based) compositional technique that employs a melody with one or more imitations of the melody played after a given duration (e.g., quarter rest, one measure, etc.). The initial melody is called the leader (or dux), while the imitative melody, which is played in a different voice, is called the follower (or comes). The follower must imitate the leader, either as an exact replication of its rhythms and intervals or some transformation thereof (see \\"Types of canon\\", below). Repeating canons in which all voices are musically identical are called rounds‚Äî\\"Row, Row, Row Your Boat\\" and \\"Fr√®re Jacques\\" are popular examples. An accompanied canon is a canon accompanied by one or more additional independent parts that do not imitate the melody. History During the Middle Ages, Renaissance, and Baroque‚Äîthat is, through the early 18th century‚Äîany kind of imitative musical counterpoints were called fugues, with the strict imitation now known as canon qualified as fuga ligata, meaning \\"fettered fugue\\" (; ; ). Only in the 16th century did the word \\"canon\\" begin to be used to describe the strict, imitative texture created by such a procedure . The word is derived from the Greek \\"Œ∫Œ±ŒΩœéŒΩ\\", Latinised as canon, which means \\"law\\" or \\"norm\\", and may be related to 8th century Byzantine hymns, or canons, like the Great Canon by St. Andrew of Crete. In contrapuntal usage, the word refers to the \\"rule\\" explaining the number of parts, places of entry, transposition, and so on, according to which one or more additional parts may be derived from a single written melodic line. This rule was usually given verbally, but could also be supplemented by special signs in the score, sometimes themselves called canoni . The earliest known non-religious canons are English rounds, a form first given the name rondellus by Walter Odington at the beginning of the 14th century ; the best known is Sumer Is Icumen In (composed around 1250), called a rota (\\"wheel\\") in the manuscript source (; ). The term \\"round\\" only first came to be used in English sources in the 16th century . Canons featured in the music of the Italian Trecento and the 14th- century ars nova in France. An Italian example is \\"Tosto che l'alba\\" by Gherardello da Firenze. In both France and Italy, canons were often featured in hunting songs. The medieval and modern Italian word for hunting is \\"caccia\\", while the medieval French word is spelled \\"chace\\" (modern spelling: \\"chasse\\"). A well-known French chace is the anonymous Se je chant mains. Richard describes Se je chant mains as evoking the atmosphere of a falcon hunt: \\"The middle section is truly a tour de force, but of a wholly new and off-beat type: a riot of hockets set to 'words' mixing French, bird-language, and hound-language in an onomatopoetical m√©lange.\\" Guillaume de Machaut also used the 3-voice \\"chace\\" form in movements from his masterpiece Le Lai de la Fontaine (1361). Referring to the setting of the fourth stanza of this work, says \\"a well-wrought chace can be far more than the sum of its parts; and this particular chace is possibly Machaut's greatest feat of subtilitas.\\" An example of late 14th century canon which featured some of the rhythmic complexity of the late 14th century ars subtilior school of composers is La harpe de melodie by Jacob de Senleches. According to Richard , \\"This virelai has two canonic voices over a free and textless tenor.\\" La harpe de melodie Jacob de Senleches, La harpe de melodie In many pieces in three contrapuntal parts, only two of the voices are in canon, while the remaining voice is a free melodic line. In Dufay's song \\"Resvelons nous, amoureux\\", the lower two voices are in canon, but the upper part is what David describes as a \\"florid top line\\": Dufay Resvelons nous Dufay, \\"Resvelons nous amoureux\\" Both J. S. Bach and Handel featured canons in their works. The final variation of Handel's keyboard Chaconne in G major (HWV 442) is a canon in which the player's right hand is imitated at the distance of one beat, creating rhythmic ambiguity within the prevailing triple time: Handel Chaconne HWV 442 Var 62 Handel, final Variation (no. 62) from Chaconne in G major, HWV 442 An example of a classical strict canon is the Minuet of Haydn's String Quartet in D Minor, Op. 76, No. 2 . \\"Throughout its sinewy length, between upper and lower strings. Here is the superbly logical fulfilment of the two-part octave doubling of Haydn's earliest divertimento minuets\\" : Haydn Minuet from Quartet in D minor, Op. 76 Minuet from Haydn, String Quartet in D minor, Op. 76, No. 2 Beethoven's works feature a number of passages in canon. The following comes from his Symphony No. 4: Beethoven Symphony No. 4 canonic passage from the 1st movement Beethoven Symphony No. 4, first movement, canonic passage Antony describes the above as \\"a delightfully na√Øve canon\\". More sophisticated and varied in its treatment of intervals and harmonic implications is the canonic passage from the second movement of his Piano Sonata 28 in A major, Op. 101: Beethoven canon from piano sonata in A, Op. 101 Beethoven, canonic passage from the second movement of Piano Sonata Op. 101 Beethoven‚Äôs most spectacular and dramatically effective use of canon occurs in the first act of his opera Fidelio. Here, four of the characters sing a quartet in canon, \\"a sublime musical wonder\\" , accompanied by orchestration of the utmost delicacy and refinement. \\"Each of the four participants delivers his or her quatrain\\" , \\"The use of canon to embody the differing perspectives of the participants a first glance seems odd, but the rigid form allows for some character differentiation and does in fact make a dramatic point\\" . \\"Everyone sings the same music to very different words, sinking their private thoughts into musical or at least linear anonymity\\" . \\"The softly padding gait, the dove- tailed perfection of the counterpoint, induce a trance that, carrying the protagonists outside Time, hints that there are realms of truth beyond the masks they pathetically or comically present to the world\\" . In the Romantic era, the use of devices such as canon was even more often subtly hidden, as for example in Schumann's piano piece \\"Vogel als Prophet\\" (1851).Schumann, \\"Vogel als Prophet\\" from Waldszenen Schumann, \\"Vogel als Prophet\\" According to Nicholas , \\"the canon is, as it were, absorbed into the texture of the music‚Äîit is there, but one doesn't easily hear it.\\" Peter describes Brahms' Intermezzo in F minor, Op. 118 No. 4 as a piece \\"rich in canons\\". In the following passage, the left hand shadows the right at the time distance of one beat and at the pitch interval of an octave lower: Brahms Intermezzo Op. 118, no. 4 From Brahms Intermezzo Op. 118, no. 4 Michael writes that as a result of the strict canon at the octave, the piece is \\"of an anxious, suppressed nature, [...] in the central section this tension is temporarily eased through a very contained passage which employs the canon in chordal terms between the hands.\\" According to Denis Matthews, \\"[what] looks on paper like another purely intellectual exercise... in practice it produces a warmly melodic effect\\" . Types of canon Considering the many types of canon \\"in the tonal repertoire\\", it may be ironic that \\"canon‚Äîthe strictest type of imitation‚Äîhas such a wide variety of possibilities\\" . The most rigid and ingenious forms of canon are not strictly concerned with pattern but also with content. Canons are classified by various traits including the number of voices, the interval at which each successive voice is transposed in relation to the preceding voice, whether voices are inverse, retrograde, or retrograde-inverse; the temporal distance between each voice, whether the intervals of the second voice are exactly those of the original or if they are adjusted to fit the diatonic scale, and the tempo of successive voices. However, canons may use more than one of the above methods. Terminology Although, for clarity, this article uses leader and follower(s) to denote the leading voice in a canon and those that imitate it, musicological literature also uses the traditional Latin terms dux and comes for \\"leader\\" and \\"follower\\", respectively. =Number of voices= A canon of two voices may be called a canon in two, similarly a canon of x voices would be called a canon in x. This terminology may be used in combination with a similar terminology for the interval between each voice, different from the terminology in the following paragraph. Another standard designation is \\"Canon: Two in One\\", which means two voices in one canon. \\"Canon: Four in Two\\" means four voices with two simultaneous canons. While \\"Canon: Six in Three\\" means six voices with three simultaneous canons, and so on. =Simple= A simple canon (also known as a round) imitates the leader perfectly at the octave or unison. Well-known canons of this type include the famous children's songs Row, Row, Row Your Boat and Fr√®re Jacques. =Interval= Beginning of psalm motet De profundis by Josquin des Prez, featuring a canon at the fourth between the two upper voices in the first six bars. If the follower imitates the precise interval quality of the leader, then it is called a strict canon; if the follower imitates the interval number (but not the quality‚Äîe.g., a major third may become a minor third), it is called a free canon . =Contrapuntal derivations= The follower is by definition a contrapuntal derivation of the leader. =Canon by inversion= An inversion canon (also called an al rovescio canon) has the follower moving in contrary motion to the leader. Where the leader would go down by a particular interval, the follower goes up by that same interval . =Retrograde or crab canon= In a retrograde canon, also known as a canon cancrizans (Latin for crab canon, derived from the Latin cancer = crab), the follower accompanies the leader backward (in retrograde). Alternative names for this type are canon per recte et retro or canon per rectus et inversus . =Mensuration and tempo canons= In a mensuration canon (also known as a prolation canon, or a proportional canon), the follower imitates the leader by some rhythmic proportion. The follower may double the rhythmic values of the leader (augmentation or sloth canon) or it may cut the rhythmic proportions in half (diminution canon). Phasing involves the application of modulating rhythmic proportions according to a sliding scale. The cancrizans, and often the mensuration canon, take exception to the rule that the follower must start later than the leader; that is, in a typical canon, a follower cannot come before the leader (for then the labels 'leader' and 'follower' should be reversed) or at the same time as the leader (for then two lines together would constantly be in unison, or parallel thirds, etc., and there would be no counterpoint), whereas in a crab canon or mensuration canon the two lines can start at the same time and still respect good counterpoint. Many such canons were composed during the Renaissance, particularly in the late fifteenth and early sixteenth centuries; Johannes Ockeghem wrote an entire mass (the Missa prolationum) in which each section is a mensuration canon, and all at different speeds and entry intervals. In the 20th century, Conlon Nancarrow composed complex tempo or mensural canons, mostly for the player piano as they are extremely difficult to play. Larry Polansky has an album of mensuration canons, Four-Voice Canons. Arvo P√§rt has written several mensuration canons, including Cantus in Memoriam Benjamin Britten, Arbos and Festina Lente. Per N√∏rg√•rd's infinity series has a sloth canon structure . This self-similarity of sloth canons makes it \\"fractal like\\". Other types of canon The most familiar of the canons is the perpetual/infinite canon (in Latin: canon perpetuus) or round. As each voice of the canon arrives at its end it can begin again, in a perpetuum mobile fashion; e.g., \\"Three Blind Mice\\". Such a canon is also called a round or, in medieval Latin terminology, a rota. Sumer is icumen in is one example of a piece designated rota. Additional types include the spiral canon, accompanied canon, and double or triple canon. A double canon is a canon with two simultaneous themes, a triple canon has three. =Double canon= A double canon is a composition that unfolds two different canons simultaneously. A duet aria, \\"Herr, du siehst statt guter Werke\\" from J. S. Bach's Cantata BWV 9, Es ist das Heil uns kommen her features a double canon \\"between flute and oboe on the one hand and the soprano and alto voices on the other. But what is most interesting in this movement is that the very attractive melodic surface of the canon belies its dogmatic message by offering a moving simplicity of tone to indicate the comfort that particular doctrine provides for the believer. Canonic devices often bear the association of strictness and the law in Bach's work\\" . Bach, passage from Duet aria \\"Herr, du siehst statt guter Werke\\" in Cantata BWV9Bach, passage from Duet aria \\"Herr, du siehst statt guter Werke\\" in Cantata BWV9 =Mirror canon= In a mirror canon (or canon by contrary motion), the subsequent voice imitates the initial voice in inversion. They are not very common, though examples of mirror canons can be found in the works of Bach, Mozart (e.g., the trio from Serenade for Wind Octet in C, K. 388), Webern, and other composers. =Table canon= A Table canon is a retrograde and inverse canon meant to be placed on a table in between two musicians, who both read the same line of music in opposite directions. As both parts are included in each single line, a second line is not needed. Bach wrote a few table canons . =Rhythmic canon= Olivier Messiaen employed a technique which he called \\"rhythmic canon\\", a polyphony of independent strands in which the pitch material differs. An example is found in the piano part of the first of the Trois petites liturgies de la pr√©sence divine, where the left hand (doubled by strings and maracas), and the right hand (doubled by vibraphone) play the same rhythmic sequence in a 3:2 ratio, but the right hand adapts a sequence of 13 chords in the sixth mode (B-C-D-E- F-F-G-A-B) onto the 18 duration values, while the left hand twice states nine chords in the third mode . Peter Maxwell Davies was another post-tonal composer who favoured rhythmic canons, where the pitch materials are not obliged to correspond . =Puzzle canon= Ernst Friedrich Same canon, presented by the composer as a puzzle, with multiple clefs provided as clues \\"Wann?\\", canon for soprano and alto by Brahms A puzzle canon, riddle canon, or enigma canon is a canon in which only one voice is notated and the rules for determining the remaining parts and the time intervals of their entrances must be guessed . \\"The enigmatical character of a [puzzle] canon does not consist of any special way of composing it, but only of the method of writing it down, of which a solution is required\\" . Clues hinting at the solution may be provided by the composer, in which case the term \\"riddle canon\\" can be used . J. S. Bach presented many of his canons in this form, for example in The Musical Offering. Mozart, after solving Father Martini's puzzles , composed his own riddles, K. 73r, using Latin epigrams such as Sit trium series una and Ter ternis canite vocibus (\\"Let there be one series of three parts\\" and \\"sing three times with three voices\\") . Other notable contributors to the genre include Ciconia, Ockeghem, Byrd, Beethoven, Brumel, Busnois, Haydn, Josquin des Prez, Mendelssohn, Pierre de la Rue, Brahms, Schoenberg, Nono and Maxwell Davies (; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ). According to Oliver B. Ellsworth, the earliest known enigma canon appears to be an anonymous ballade, En la maison Dedalus, found at the end of a collection of five theory treatises from the third quarter of the fourteenth century collected in the Berkeley Manuscript . Thomas Morley complained that sometimes a solution, \\"which being founde (it might bee) was scant worth the hearing\\" (, cited, inter al., by ). J. G. Albrechtsberger admits that, \\"when we have traced the secret, we have gained but little; as the proverb says, 'Parturiunt montes, etc.'\\" but adds that, \\"these speculative passages...serve to sharpen acumen\\" . Elaborate use of canon technique * Josquin des Prez, Missa L'homme arm√© super voces musicales, Agnus Dei 2: One voice with the words 'ex una voce tres' (three voice parts out of one), a mensuration canon in three voices. * Josquin des Prez, Missa L'homme arm√© sexti toni, Agnus Dei 2: two simultaneous canons in the four upper voices, and at the same time a crab canon in the two lower voices. * Johann Sebastian Bach's Goldberg Variations contains nine canons of increasing interval size, ranging from unison to ninth. Each canon additionally obeys the overall structure and harmonic sequence common to all variations in the composition. Contemporary canons In his early work, such as Piano Phase (1967) and Clapping Music (1972), Steve Reich used a process he calls phasing which is a \\"continually adjusting\\" canon with variable distance between the voices, in which melodic and harmonic elements are not important, but rely simply on the time intervals of imitation .

He commanded one of the first Hussar squadrons of Frederick the Great's army and is credited with the development of the Prussian cavalry to its efficient level of performance in the Seven Years' War. His cavalryman father retired and then died while Seydlitz was still young. Subsequently, he was mentored by Margrave Frederick William of Brandenburg-Schwedt. Seydlitz's superb horsemanship and his recklessness combined to make him a stand-out subaltern, and he emerged as a redoubtable Rittmeister (cavalry captain) in the War of Austrian Succession (1740‚Äì1748) during the First and Second Silesian Wars. Seydlitz became legendary throughout the Prussian Army both for his leadership and for his reckless courage. During the Seven Years' War, he came into his own as a cavalry general, known for his coup d'≈ìil, his ability to assess at a glance the entire battlefield situation and to understand intuitively what needed to be done: he excelled at converting the King's directives into flexible tactics. At the Battle of Rossbach, his cavalry was instrumental in routing the French and Imperial armies. His cavalry subsequently played an important role in crushing the Habsburg and Imperial left flank at the Battle of Leuthen. Seydlitz was wounded in battle several times. After the Battle of Kunersdorf in August 1759, he semi-retired to recover from his wounds, charged with the protection of the city of Berlin. He was not healthy enough to campaign again until 1761. Frederick rewarded him with Order of the Black Eagle on the field after the Battle of Rossbach; he had already received the Pour le M√©rite for his action at the Battle of Kolin. Although estranged from Frederick for several years, the two were reconciled during Seydlitz's final illness. Seydlitz died in 1773, and Frederick's heirs included his name on the Equestrian statue of Frederick the Great in Berlin, in a place of honor. Early life Seydlitz was born on 3 February 1721, in Kalkar in the Duchy of Cleves, where his father, Daniel Florian Seydlitz, was a major of Prussian cavalry with the Cuirassier Regiment Markgraf Friedrich Wilhelm of Brandenburg-Schwedt No. 5. In 1726, his father left military service and moved the family to Schwedt, where he became a forestry master in East Prussia; the senior Seydlitz died in 1728, leaving a widow and children in restricted financial circumstances.Sources differ on the number of siblings Seydlitz had. reports two sisters and a brother; simply says three children total. Limited schooling was available to young Seydlitz; sources differ whether he knew how to speak and write in French, the lingua franca of Frederick the Great's Court. One biographer, Bernhard von Poten, maintained that his German was good, and if he knew French, he preferred German and wrote it with a \\"fine, firm hand, unusually correct, in well-formed sentences and with apt expression,\\" and he knew enough Latin to express himself well. His future sovereign, Frederick, always addressed him in German. By Seydlitz's seventh year, he could ride a horse well, raced with older boys, and he was, by most accounts, a wild and high-spirited child. At the age of fourteen he went as a page to the court of the Margrave Frederick Wilhelm of Brandenburg-Schwedt, who had been his father's colonel. The Margrave was a grandson of the Great Elector, and a nephew to both Frederick I of Prussia and Leopold of Anhalt Dessau. Himself a reckless man, the \\"Mad\\" Margrave inspired in young Seydlitz a passion for feats of daredevil horsemanship. Seydlitz did not limit this passion to horses: the Margrave once dared him to ride a wild stag, which he did. Seydlitz became a skilled horseman, and many stories tell of his feats, the best known of which involved riding between the sails of a windmill in full swing. Seydlitz remained in his position as a page to the Margrave until King Frederick William appointed him as cornet in the Margrave's Cuirassier Regiment No. 5 (his father's old regiment) on 13 February 1740.

Within a year of Seydlitz's commission, the old King Frederick William died and his son, Frederick II of Prussia, ascended to the throne. Frederick claimed Silesia from the Habsburg's Maria Theresa, and made a broad appeal to arms. The Margrave's regiment played an important role in the ensuing war, during which Seydlitz came to the notice of the King several times. Once, when Frederick asked the caliber of the artillery shelling the Prussian line, opinions were divided and vague. Seydlitz rode in front of the battery, halting in their line of fire. When he saw a ball hit the ground, he picked it up, wrapped it in his handkerchief and presented it to the King. In May 1742, while stationed with his regiment in Kranowitz during the First Silesian War, the regimental colonel ordered him to take 30 men and hold a village post until infantry came to his assistance; despite heavy fire, the grudging colonel did not send reinforcements. Realizing what had happened, the brigade's general took three squadrons of heavy cavalry to relieve Seydlitz, but these were turned back by fire from the Austrian line. Subsequently, Seydlitz was forced to surrender his small unit. He entered into Austrian captivity with several of his closest comrades, including Charles de Warnery. Frederick exchanged an Austrian captain for Cornet Seydlitz. Upon his return from captivity, Seydlitz had a choice to wait for the first lieutenancy that became available in a cuirassier regiment, or take the immediate command of a troop of hussars, as a captain. Hussars were the newest form of service in the Prussian army, and not as prestigious an assignment as cuirassiers, but Seydlitz chose the immediate promotion to a lesser unit. In 1743, the King made him a Rittmeister (captain) in the 4th Hussars. He entirely skipped the rank of lieutenant. With the 4th Hussars, he was stationed in the city of Trebnitz and he brought his squadron to a state of conspicuous efficiency. In August 1744, the King entered Bohemia, took Prague, and then moved south. Lieutenant General Count Nassau led the vanguard, and Seydlitz participated with the Natzmer Hussars, commanded by Major Hans Heinrich Adam Sch√ºtz, a violent man of whose conduct of warfare Seydlitz disapproved.Sch√ºtz reportedly dragooned peasants to serve as his guides, and then executed them when he was finished with them; he burned villages, including churches, and generally waged war on Silesian peasants. Seydlitz served through the Second Silesian War. On 22 May, Hans Karl von Winterfeldt, trusted by the King as a good judge of character, reported to Frederick: \\"Certainly, at Hohenfriedberg, on the 4 June, [Seydlitz] captured the Saxon general [Georg Sigismund] von Schlichting personally, after he had cut the reins from him.\\" Based largely on his conduct at Hohenfriedberg and Winterfeldt's recommendation, Frederick promoted Seydlitz to major on 28 July at the unusually young age of twenty-four. Seydlitz led his squadron at the Battle of Soor on 30 September, scouting the enemy's position before the battle, and then participating in the action. He was also present in the engagement at Katholisch-Hennersdorf on 23 November, which proved convincingly to Frederick the benefit of close support during a cavalry charge. At the successful action on 27 November, Seydlitz led 15 squadrons in an attack on the Austrian rear guard. The Austrians were dispersed and nearly destroyed. =Development of cavalry tactics= Seydlitz smoked a pipe, and when he tossed it away, it was the sign for his troopers to proceed. Depicted here at the Battle of Rossbach, in a section of a history painting by Richard Kn√∂tel (1857‚Äì1914) After Frederick concluded the peace on 25 December 1748, Seydlitz returned with his squadron to Trebnitz. In the subsequent years of peace, Seydlitz developed flexible cavalry tactics. He assembled a plan on tactical form and training for the Prussian cavalry and presented it to the King. Frederick approved the procedures and Seydlitz established a rigorous training program. He would leave his own estate by jumping the gate; he required similar horsemanship from all his men, regardless of whether they were cuirassiers, hussars or dragoons. They had to be capable of galloping across broken fields, wheeling in formation, and riding in close action. Furthermore, they had to be prepared to support any movement of infantry, or to react to any action from the enemy. Under Seydlitz's direction, Prussian cavalry learned to use only their swords, not the pistols or carbines that could not be fired with accuracy or then had to be reloaded. Frederick set up straw dummies for his troopers to shoot; their shots were woefully inaccurate, but Seydlitz's tactics demonstrated that the troopers could hit their target with a sword every time. Generally, cavalry horses were the sturdy warm-blood Trakehners, from Frederick's stud farm in Trakenhen, East Prussia. On 21 September 1752, after a successful review in which the different cavalry forms demonstrated their competencies, the King promoted Seydlitz to lieutenant colonel and the commander-in-chief of cavalry and, on 13 October of the same year, to the commander of the Dragoon Regiment W√ºrttemberg No. 12, whose staff was at Treptow. Frederick was not satisfied with the regiment's performance, and instructed Seydlitz to \\"put it back into order\\". In 1753 Frederick appointed Seydlitz to the command of the 8th Cuirassiers. In Seydlitz's hands, this regiment soon became a model for the rest of the Prussian Army's mounted force. In 1755 Frederick promoted him to colonel. By the start of the Seven Years' War, Seydlitz's transformed cavalry had become Frederick's pride and joy: it had unrivaled training and an esprit de corps bolstered by Frederick's confidence in its members, and by their confidence in Seydlitz. The King had issued orders that no Prussian cavalryman would allow himself to be attacked without a commensurate response, under penalty of being cashiered; consequently, Prussian cavalrymen were active, impetuous and aggressive. For the King, Seydlitz's cavalry became the dynamic factor in the army of the state, and would be the tool by which Frederick could challenge empires. In 1756, Seydlitz's cavalry became Frederick's weapon of choice. Seven Years' War In May 1757, in defiance of the custom of holding the heavy cavalry in reserve, Seydlitz brought his regiment forward to join the advance guard at the Battle of Prague. Here he nearly lost his life attempting to ride through a marshy pool; his horse became stuck in quicksand and his troopers pulled him away. At the Prussian loss at Kolin in June 1757, he and a cavalry brigade checked the Austrian pursuit by a brilliant charge. Two days later, the King promoted him to major general and awarded him the Pour le M√©rite. Seydlitz felt he had deserved the promotion for a long time, for he responded to Hans Joachim von Zieten's congratulations by saying, \\"It was high time, Excellency, if they wanted more work out of me. I am already thirty-six.\\" Another example of his leadership and his coup d'≈ìil, the ability to see at a glance what needed to be done, occurred after the Battle of Kolin. The loss at Kolin forced the King to lift the siege at Prague. The King's brother, Augustus William, took command of the army and ordered the retreat from Prague. Seydlitz was attached to the advanced corps of Karl Christoph von Schmettau in a brigade of ten squadrons. As Seydlitz's wing entered Lusatia, near the town of Zittau, the Austrians were present in force, and Seydlitz with his squadrons were trapped in the town. Tricking the Austrians into thinking his troop was a foraging party, his cavalry burst on the Austrian cavalry before they could climb into their saddles. Seydlitz led his cavalry in an escape, in close column, and was quickly out of sight. =Battle of Rossbach= On the morning of the Battle of Rossbach, Frederick passed over two senior generals and placed Seydlitz in command of the whole of the cavalry, much to those men's annoyance and to Seydlitz's satisfaction. At Rossbach, Seydlitz's coup d'≈ìil and his understanding of the King's objectives led to battlefield success. After positioning the cavalry in two ranked lines, he watched the French army move for several minutes, while puffing on his pipe; his troopers never took their eyes off him. When he threw his pipe away, this was the signal they had waited for: the first line of massed squadrons surged forward, smashing the unprepared French in the flank. Typically, cavalry action in the mid-eighteenth century meant a single cavalry charge; the cavalry would spend the rest of the action pursuing fleeing troops. At Rossbach, though, not content with this single attack, Seydlitz called his second formation of squadrons in another charge; he then withdrew all 38 squadrons into a copse, where they regrouped under cover of the trees.The K2169 (a county roadway) passing through Reichertswerben is named von Seydlitz Strasse.

Without waiting for new orders from the King, Seydlitz deployed the Prussian cavalry a third time; this proved a critical factor in the battle. As trained, Seydlitz's squadrons charged headlong into the French columns: a massive wall of horses galloping flank to flank, their riders flashing swords and maneuvering at full speed. By the end of the battle, only seven infantry battalions of Frederick's army had fired a shot; the rest of the victory had been the work of Seydlitz's 38 squadrons and Karl Friedrich von Moller's artillery. That day, the Prussians took as trophies 72 cannons (62 percent of the French/Imperial artillery), seven flags, and 21 standards. With some 3,500 horsemen and 20 cannons, plus a portion of Prince Henry's regiment of infantry, the Prussian army had defeated the combined armies of two European powers, France and the Holy Roman Empire. The tactics at Rossbach became a landmark in the history of military art. The same night, on the field, the King awarded Seydlitz the Order of the Black Eagle, and promoted him to lieutenant general. Seydlitz had been wounded during the mel√©e and he remained out of action for four months, nursed by a lady in Leipzig. =Campaign 1758‚Äì59= Seydlitz rejoined the King in 1758 and on 25 August, at the Battle of Zorndorf, Seydlitz's cavalry again secured the victory. He led thirty-six squadrons into a mass of Russian cavalry mingled with infantry. This charge broke the Russian right wing and sent them running for the woods. At the Prussian debacle at Hochkirch, on 14 October 1758, he covered the Prussian retreat with 108 squadrons, and in the disaster of Kunersdorf, on 12 August 1759, he received another severe wound in a hopeless attempt to storm a hill held by the Russians; his 8th Cuirassiers was one of the few intact regiments at the end of the battle. While recuperating in Berlin, he helped organize a defense of the city during the Austro-Russian raid (October 1760). Although he was unable to prevent the Russians from briefly occupying the city, Frederick later praised Seydlitz for his conduct. Seydlitz's health frequently kept him off the battlefield, and he did not reappear at the front until 1761. Then, he received command of a wing of Prince Henry's army, composed of troops of all arms, and many of his fellow officers expressed doubts as to his fitness for this command, as his service had been with the cavalry exclusively. Subsequently, though, at Freiberg on 29 October 1762, his direction of both his infantry and his cavalry in turn decided the outcome of the battle. Later life Statue of Seydlitz at Wilhelm Platz in Berlin After the Seven Years' War concluded with the Treaty of Hubertusburg (1763), Seydlitz became inspector general of the cavalry in Silesia, where eleven regiments were permanently stationed and where Frederick sent all his most promising officers to be trained. In 1767, Frederick promoted Seydlitz to general of cavalry. Seydlitz's later years were marred by domestic unhappiness. During his convalescence in Berlin, on 18 April 1761, he had married Susannah Johanna Albertine Hacke, daughter of Hans Christoph Friedrich Graf von Hacke, and she was eventually unfaithful to him, reportedly due to the syphilis from which he had suffered for decades. He had at least one daughter, according to an early biographer, Anton K√∂nig, and two according to another biographer, Robert Lawley. The oldest daughter married first to an official from Breslau, and was divorced. She married second to a Polish count, and divorced soon after. She eventually converted to Catholicism, but died in a madhouse in Brieg. The youngest lived to old age and died in poverty near Lausitz. By the end of the decade, some misunderstanding brought an end to his formerly close friendship with the King. Seydlitz's health had been declining for years and he suffered from recurrent bouts of syphilis; in 1772, after an attack of apoplexy, he completed a couple of stays at the spa at Carlsbad to take the mineral waters. While these helped somewhat, his other activities continued without moderation, and to his detriment. A subordinate brought him two healthy Circassian beauties, whose company he enjoyed but who undoubtedly stressed his tenuous health. In August 1773, in his last illness, Frederick and Seydlitz met again at Seydlitz's home at Minkovsky near Ohlau (now O≈Çawa, Poland). The King sat beside his sickbed, horrified at Seydlitz's condition, and even persuaded him to take some of his medications, but Seydlitz would not look at him; the illness had already deformed his face. Eventually paralyzed, whether from another stroke or the underlying tertiary syphilis, Seydlitz died at Ohlau in Silesia in November 1773. Character Seydlitz was generally admired for the superb coup d'≈ìil that allowed him to utilize the cavalry to its full potential. His 19th-century biographer, K. A. Varnhagen von Ense, related that Seydlitz lived above all for the service, and promoted the training of his hussars before all else. According to Anton Balthasar K√∂nig, who wrote in 1780‚Äì1790, Seydlitz performed best at taverns and excelled in practical jokes: one would gather that Seydlitz was a drunkard, a rake, and a savage, but another of his biographers, Bernhard von Poten, cited conflicting descriptions offered by Seydlitz's contemporaries, particularly Warnery, as more accurate. Nevertheless, there is some evidence to support K√∂nig's assertion, at least of Seydlitz's excesses: Seydlitz was no doubt dependent upon his tobacco and had been since his teenage years, although he smoked a pipe rather than using snuff, as many officers did; he was indeed reckless, as his career testified; he enjoyed the company of women; and Seydlitz indeed suffered from recurring illness. Memorials In 1851, Frederick William IV, Frederick's great-great nephew, included Seydlitz's name on the Equestrian statue of Frederick the Great in Berlin, honoring those who had helped to build the Prussian state. Seydlitz holds a position of honor as one of the four full-sized mounted figures, sharing the first tier of the plinth with the King's brother, his cousin, and Hans Joachim von Zieten.

It is also known as \\"City of Wrestlers\\" and is quite famous for its food. The city is Pakistan's 5th most-populous metropolitan area, as well as 5th most populous city proper. Founded in the 18th century, Gujranwala is a relatively modern town compared to the many nearby millennia-old cities of northern Punjab. The city served as the capital of the Sukerchakia Misl state between 1763 and 1799, and is the birthplace of the founder of the Sikh Empire, Maharaja Ranjit Singh. Gujranwala is now Pakistan's third largest industrial centre after Karachi and Faisalabad, and contributes 5% of Pakistan's national GDP. The city is part of a network of large urban centres in north-east Punjab province that forms one of Pakistan's mostly highly industrialized regions. Along with the nearby cities of Sialkot and Gujrat, Gujranwala forms part of the so-called \\"Golden Triangle\\" of industrial cities with export-oriented economies. Etymology Gujranwala's name means \\"Abode of the Gujjars\\" in Punjabi, and was named in reference to the Gujjar tribe that live in northern Punjab.GujrƒÅnwƒÅla Town ‚Äì Imperial Gazetteer of India, v. 12, p. 363. One local narrative suggests that town was named in reference to a specific Gujjar, Choudhry Gujjar, owner of the town's Persian wheel that supplied water to the town. Evidence suggests, however, that the city derives its name from Serai Gujran (meaning inn of Gujjars)- a village once located near what is now Gujranwala's Khiyali Gate. History =Founding= The exact origins of Gujranwala are unclear. Unlike the ancient nearby cities of Lahore, Sialkot, and Eminabad, Gujranwala is a relatively modern city. It may have been established as a village in the middle of the 16th century. Locals traditionally believe that Gujranwala's original name was Khanpur Shansi, though recent scholarship suggests that the village was possibly Serai Gujran instead - a village once located near what is now Gujranwala's Khiyali Gate that was mentioned by several sources during the 18th century invasion of Ahmad Shah Abdali. =Sikh= The birthplace of Maharaja Ranjit Singh, founder of the Sikh Empire.

In 1707, with the death of the last great Mughal emperor Aurangzeb, Mughal power began to rapidly weaken especially following Nader Shah's invasion in 1739 and then completely dissipated from the Punjab region due to the invasions of Ahmad Shah Abdali who raided Punjab many times between 1747 and 1772 causing much devastation and chaos. Abdalis control over the region began to weaken in the latter part of the 18th century with the rise of the Sikh Misls (independent chieftainships usually consisting of the chief‚Äôs kinsmen) who overran Punjab. Charat Singh, ruler of the Sukerchakia Misl, established himself in a fort which he had built in the area of Gujranwala between 1756 and 1758. Nuruddin, a Jammu-based Afghan (Pashtun) general, was ordered by Abdali to subdue the Sikhs but was driven back at Sialkot by Sikh soldiers led by Charat Singh. In 1761, Khwaja Abed Khan, Abdali‚Äôs governor in Lahore, tried to besiege Charat Singh's base in Gujranwala but the bid misfired. The Sikh misls rallied to his support by attacking Afghan officers wherever they were found. A fleeing Abed Khan was pursued by Sikh contingents led by the Ahluwalia misl into Lahore, where he was killed. Charat Singh made Gujranwala the capital of his misl in 1763. In a 1774 battle waged in Jammu, Charat Singh of the Sukerchakia misl and Jhanda Singh of the powerful Bhangi misl, fighting on opposite sides, were both killed. Before his death, Charat Singh had become master of large and contiguous territories in the three doabs between the Indus and the Ravi. He was succeeded by his son Maha Singh who added to the lands that Charat Singh had not only captured but also capably administered. In the Gujranwala area in the 1770s, the Jat Chathas of Wazirabad and Rajput Bhattis of Hafizabad (Muslims in both cases) offered ‚Äòfierce resistance‚Äô to the Sukerchakias, whose attack was aided by Sahib Singh of the Bhangi misl. Describing the conflict, the (British) writer of the Gujranwala Gazetteer wrote that, besieged for weeks in his fortress, Ghulam Muhammad Chatha eventually surrendered after Maha Singh assured him safe passage to Mecca, but the promise was ‚Äòbasely broken‚Äô when Ghulam Muhammad was shot and his fortress razed to the ground. Rasoolnagar (Prophet's city) which belonged to the Chathas was renamed Ramnagar (Ram's city) to humiliate the Muslims. The Gazetteer noted that the treacherous killing of Chatha and his resistance was remembered ‚Äòin many a local ballad‚Äô in Gujranwala. The Bhattis of Hafizabad tehsil, who were Muslim Rajputs, did not cease their resistance to the Sukerchakias until 1801, when their leaders were killed and their possessions captured. Some Bhattis fled to Jhang. Ranjit Singh, Maha Singh's son and successor who would later go on to establish the Sikh Empire, was born in 1780 in Gujranwala's Purani Mandi market. Ranjit Singh maintained Gujranwala as his capital initially after rising to power in 1792. His most famous military commander Hari Singh Nalwa, who was also from Gujranwala, built a high mud wall around Gujranwala during this era and established the city's new grid street-plan that exists until the present day. Gujranwala remained Ranjit Singh's capital until he captured Lahore from the Durrani Afghans in 1799, at which point the capital was moved there, leading to the relative decline of Gujranwala in favour of Lahore.Jind Kaur, the last queen of Ranjit Singh and mother of Duleep Singh, was born in Gujranwala in 1817. By 1839, the city's bazaars were home to an estimated 500 shops, while the city had been surrounded by a number of pleasure gardens, including one established by Hari Nalwa Singh that was famous for its vast array of exotic plants. =British= Estcourt Clock Tower, commonly known as Ghanta Ghar, was built in 1906. Gujranwala's rail station dates from the British era. The area was captured by the British Empire in 1848, and rapidly developed thereafter. Gujranwala was incorporated as a municipality in 1867, and the city's Brandreth, Khiyali, and Lahori Gates built atop the site of Sikh-era gates were completed in 1869. A new clocktower was built in central Gujranwala to mark the city's centre in 1906. Christian missionaries were brought to the region during British colonial rule, and Gujranwala became home to numerous churches and schools. The city's first Presbyterian Church was established in 1875 in the Civil Lines area - a settlement built one mile north of the old city to house Gujranwala's European population. A theological seminary was established in 1877, and a Christian technical school in 1900. The North-Western Railway connected Gujranwala with other cities in British India by rail in 1881. The major Sikh higher learning institution, Gujranwala Guru Nanak Khalsa College, was founded in Gujranwala in 1889, though it later shifted to Ludhiana. The nearby Khanki Headworks were completed in 1892 under British rule, and helped irrigate 3 million acres in the province. Gujranwala's population, according to the 1901 census of British India, was 29,224. The city continued to grow rapidly for the remainder of British rule. Riots erupted in Gujranwala following the Jallianwala Bagh Massacre in Amritsar on April 1919. These were some of most violent riots to the British massacre in all of British India. Riots lead to the damage of the city's railway station and burning of the city's Tehsil Office, Clock Tower, Dak Bangla and city courts. Much of the city's historical record was burnt in the attacked offices. Protestors in the city, nearby villages, and a procession from Dhullay were fired upon with machine-guns mounted to low-flying planes, and subjected to aerial bombardment from the Royal Air Force under the control of Reginald Edward Harry Dyer. According to the 1941 census, 269,528 out of the Gujranwala District's 912,234 residents were non-Muslim.Abid, D. (1989). A Fresh Look at the Redcliffe Award. Grassroots. 54.30% of Gujranwala city residents were Muslims prior to Partition, though non-Muslims controlled much of the city's economy. Hindus and Sikhs together owned two-thirds of Gujranwala's properties. Sikhs were concentrated in the localities of Guru Nanak Pura, Guru Gobind Garh, and Dhullay Mohallah, while Hindus were dominant in Hakim Rai, Sheikhupura Gate area and Hari Singh Nalwa Bazaar. Muslims were concentrated in Rasul Pura, Islam Pura and Rehman Pura. =Partition= Tomb of Maha Singh, ruler of the Sukerchakia Misl and father of Ranjit Singh. Following the Independence of Pakistan and the aftermath of the Partition of British India in 1947, Gujranwala was site of some of the worst rioting in Punjab. Large swathes of Hindu and Sikh localities were attacked or destroyed. Rioters in the city gained notoriety for attacks, with the city's Muslim Lohar (blacksmiths) particularly carrying out brutal attacks. In retaliation for attacks against a trainload of refugees by Sikh rioters at Amritsar railway station on 22 September that resulted in the deaths of 3,000 Muslims over the course of three hours, rioters from Gujranwala attacked a trainload of Hindus and Sikhs fleeing towards India on 23 September, killing 340 refugees in the nearby town of Kamoke. Partition riots in Gujranwala resulted in systematic violence against the city's minorities, and may constitute an act of ethnic cleansing by modern standards. Gujranwala became home to Muslim refugees who were fleeing from the widespread anti-Muslim pogroms that depopulated eastern Punjab in India of almost its entire Muslim population. Refugees in Gujranwala were mainly those who had fled from the cities of Amritsar, Patiala, and Ludhiana in what had become the Indian state of East Punjab. =Modern= The influx of Muslim refugees into Gujranwala drastically altered the city's form. By March 1948, over 300,000 refugees had been resettled in Gujranwala District. Many refugees found post-Partition Gujranwala lacking in opportunities, causing some to move south to Karachi. The refugee population mostly settled in localities that were mostly non-Muslim, like Gobindgarh, Baghbanpura and Nanakpura. Suburban districts were rapidly laid, including Satellite Town in 1950, which was designed mostly to house wealthy and upper middle-class refugees. D-Colony was built in 1956 for poorer Kashmiri refugees, and Model Town in the 1960s. The city experienced strong industrial growth during this period. In 1947, there were only 39 registered factories - a number which rose to 225 by 1961. The city's colonial era metal-working industry continued to grow, while the city became a centre of hosiery manufacturing that was run by refugees from Ludhiana. The city's jewelry-trade had been run by Hindus but came under control of refugees from Patiala. Gujranwala's economy continued to grow into the 1970s and 1980s. New development continues, such as the opening of a 5,774 foot long flyover that functions as an elevated urban expressway, as well as the nearby Sialkot International Airport which serves the entire Golden Triangle region, and is Pakistan's first privately owned commercial airport. Educations of higher learning have also been established in the city since independence. The Sialkot-Lahore Motorway, due to be open in 2018, will pass near Gujranwala. Geography Gujranwala sits at the heart of the Rechna Doab - a strip of land between the Chenab in the north, and Ravi River in the south. Gujranwala is also part of the Majha - a historical region of northern Punjab. The city was built upon the plains of Punjab, and the surrounding region is unbroken plain devoid of topographical diversity. Gujranwala is in the Rechna Doab region of Punjab, marked in grey. Gujranwala is 226 metres (744 ft) above sea level, sharing borders with Ghakhar Mandi and several towns and villages. About south is the provincial capital, Lahore. Sialkot and Gujrat lie to its north. Gujrat connects Gujranwala with Bhimber, Azad Kashmir, and Sialkot connects it with Jammu. About southwest is Faisalabad. To its west are Hafizabad and Pindi Bhattian, which connect Gujranwala to Jhang, Chiniot and Sargodha. =Climate= Gujranwala has a hot semi-arid climate (BSh), according to the K√∂ppen-Geiger system, and changes throughout the year. During summer (June to September), the temperature reaches . The coolest months are usually November to February, when the temperature can drop to an average of . The highest-precipitation months are usually July and August when the monsoon reaches the Punjab. During the other months, the average rainfall is about . October to May have little rainfall.Jinnah Stadium, Gujranwala ‚Äì Monthly Averages =Urban form= Brandreth Gate in old Gujranwala. The Civil Lines neighbourhood has many buildings that date from the British colonial era. Gujranwala's oldest precincts were laid according to the new city plan devised by Hari Singh Nalwa, following Ranjit Singh's establishment of Gujranwala as his capital in 1792. A street plan based mostly on a grid plan was implemented, with bazaars intersecting one another at 90-degree angles. Some of the blocks are rectangular in shape, resulting in a polygonal shaped old city. This old city was then enclosed by a high mud wall with gates and a fort that was built immediately north of the old city. The city's Sheranwala Bagh was also expanded under Hari Singh Nalwa's direction. Gujranwala's old city is centred on the Shahi (Royal) Bazaar. The old city is home to many of the city's pre-Partition houses of worship for Hindus and Sikhs. The Hindu Devi Talab temple was once famous for its large water-tank, and remains in good condition despite being used as a residence for a family who fled Patiala. The Sikh Gurdwara Damdama Sahib is located near the Devi Talab temple, is important in Sikhism for its association with Baba Sahib Singh Bedi, a Sikh saint. An old gurdwara is also located near the Chashma Chowk intersection near Shahi Bazaar. Gujranwala grew rapidly following British rule, and connection of the city to the railways of British India. The city grew outside of the city's walls, requiring new bazaars to be laid - which were done in a radial plan centred on the old city. Some historic structures like the Haveli of Sardar Mahan Singh were torn down by the British and replaced with other structures. The city's Brandreth, Lahori, and Khiyali Gates were built atop the city's demolished original gates, while Mahan Singh's haveli was transformed into a public square named Ranjit Ganj. The city's boundaries remained mostly west of the railways line prior to 1947. The Civil Lines neighbourhood was built for European residents approximately one mile north of the old city. The area was characterized by bungalows, large and verdant lawns, and shady tree-lined avenues. Civil Lines is where the city's Presbyterian Church was built in 1875, while the city's Theological Seminary was established here in 1877. The Christian Technical Training Center followed suit in 1900. The city's elite Hindus and Sikhs eventually also settled in small numbers in Civil Lines. Several of their mansions still remain in the area including those of Charan Singh, Banarsi Shah, as well as other buildings such as Islamia College and Khurshid Manzil. Growth occurred mostly in areas northwest and southeast of the city immediately after independence until 1965 along routes emanating from old Gujranwala. Satellite Town was established on the southwest side in 1950. Areas northeast and southwest of the city were the sites of most growth between 1965 and 1985. Growth grow outwards mostly evenly after 1985 until present time. Much of the growth has been unplanned due to poor enforcement of development guidelines and lax enforcement of property laws. Architecture Saint Paul's Presbyterian Church There are various historic buildings in Gujranwala, e.g. Brandreth Gate, Lahori Gate, Khiyali Gate in the Bazar area, the Main Railway Station built in 1881 und the Clock Tower dating from 1906. One of the largest churches is Saint Paul's Presbyterian Church, inaugurated in 2010. Demography Gujranwala is the 5th largest city in Pakistan by population. Since the 2000s the population growth rate of Gujranwala has averaged at 3.0%. The population growth rate is projected to slow down to 2.51% by 2035https://worldpopulationreview.com/world-cities/gujranwala-population. Economy Gujranwala is home to a wide variety of industries. Gujranwala is the Pakistan's third largest centre of industrial production, after Karachi and Faisalabad. Gujranwala, along with the nearby industrial cities of Sialkot and Gujrat City, form what is sometimes referred to as the Golden Triangle in reference to their relative prosperity and export-oriented industrial base. The city's industries employ up to 500,000 people, while the city's GDP makes up 5% of Pakistan's overall economy. An estimated 6,500 small and medium enterprises, 25,000 cottage units, and some large factories, are located in and around the city as of 2002 -and are engaged in the manufacture of a wide variety of goods.http://www.dawn.com/news/1143243http://gbc.org.pk/index.php?option=com_content&view;=article&id;=49&Itemid;=18 The city is the centre for manufacture and export of sanitary fittings and wares in Pakistan, with over 200 producers based in Gujranwala. More than 60 producers of auto parts are found in the city. The city is well known as a centre for manufacturing electric fans - with 150 small and medium enterprises in Gujranwala tied to the electric fan industry. The city is Pakistan's third largest centre for iron and steel manufacturing - reflecting Gujranwala's historic association with metalworking since the migration of the Lohar clan of blacksmiths to the city during the colonial era. The city has been a centre of hosiery-manfuacture since the migration of refugees primarily from Ludhiana in 1947. Textiles, apparel, yarn, and other textile goods are also produced in Gujranwala. Other manufacturing based in the city include rice, plastic, cutlery, coolers and heaters, agricultural tools and equipment, carpets, glass goods, surgical equipment, leather products, and machinery for military uses, domestic appliances, motorcycles, and food products. The rural regions surrounding Gujranwala are heavily engaged in the production of wheat and are yield more wheat per acre than the national average. Gujranwala District is also the most productive region for rice-growing in Punjab. In 2010, Gujranwala was rated number 6 out of Pakistan's top 13 cities in order of ease of doing business by the World Bank, and was ranked the second-best in Pakistan for construction permits. Pakistan's electric shortages of the 2010s severely stymied the city's growth. Industrial units in the city suffered an average of 2872 hours per year in Gujranwala in 2012. By the end of 2017, the supply of electricity had drastically improved with augmented electric generation as a result of new power-stations coming online. Improved supplies of electricity contributed to the country's double-digit rise in exports in the second half of 2017. Transportation Hospital road and Sialkot road, Church road, Gujranwala =Road= Gujranwala Flyover Gujranwala is situated along the historic Grand Trunk Road that connects Peshawar to Islamabad and Lahore. The Grand Trunk Road also provides access to the Afghan border via the Khyber Pass, with onward connections to Kabul and Central Asia via the Salang Pass. The Karakoram Highway provides access between Islamabad and western China, and an alternate route to Central Asia via Kashgar, China. Gujranwala is connected to Lahore by Sialkot-Lahore Motorway. The motorway passes east of the Grand Trunk Road, and terminates near the Sialkot International Airport. Plans for the motorway's extension farther north to Kharian near Gujrat City were announced in late 2017. =Rail= Gujranwala railway station Gujranwala railway station serves as a stop along Pakistan's -long Main Line-1 railway that connects the city to the port city of Karachi to Peshawar.

Upgrading of the railway line will permit train travel at speeds of 160 kilometres per hour, versus the average 60 to 105 km per hour speed currently possible on existing track. =Air= Gujranwala has no airport of its own. The city is instead served by airports in nearby cities, including the Allama Iqbal International Airport in Lahore that offers non-stop flights to Europe, Canada, Central Asia, East Asia, and Southeast Asia. Gujranwala is also serviced by the nearby Sialkot International Airport - Pakistan's first privately owned commercial airport. Built in 2007, the airport offers non-stop service to the Middle East, as well as domestic locations. =Public transportation= Gujranwala lacks a centrally managed public transportation system. Uber became available in Gujranwala in early 2017, and were soon followed by Careem. Administration Gujranwala and its environs were amalgamated into a district in 1951. The Gujranwala Development Authority was established in 1989 to oversea economic and infrastructure development in the city. The city is currently administered by the City District Government Gujranwala (CDGG) and Municipal Corporation Gujranwala, while development is generally under the office of the Gujranwala Development Authority. In 2007, the city was re-classified as a city-district with 7 constituent municipalities: Aroop, Kamonke, Khiali Shahpur, Nandipur, Nowshera Virkan, Qila Didar Singh, and Wazirabad Towns.

James Gadsden served as Adjutant General of the U. S. Army from August 13, 1821 ‚Äì March 22, 1822. Between 1853 and 1856, he served as U. S. Minister to Mexico. He was known commonly as General Gadsden, although he never had a rank above Colonel. Biography Little is known about the life of Gadsden, especially his early life. It is known that he was born in Charleston, South Carolina, during 1788, and that he was grandson of the American Revolutionary War hero Christopher Gadsden, for whom the Gadsden flag was named. It is also known that Gadsden earned his bachelor's degree from Yale University in Connecticut, completing this degree in 1806. =Army service= Gadsden joined the U.S. Army in December 1812. He served as a commissioned officer commanded by General Andrew Jackson, who was to elected president in 1828. Gadsden served Gen. Jackson both during the War of 1812 against the British Army, and, from 1816 to 1821, in protecting the southern U.S. border from raiders ‚Äî Native Americans, maroons (escaped slaves and their descendants) ‚Äî based in Spanish Florida. As part of this effort, Jackson directed Gadsden, a member of the Army Corps of Engineers, to build a fort on the Prospect Bluff site. Jackson subsequently named it Fort Gadsden. Gadsden also helped to establish Fort Brooke with George Mercer Brooke at the site of the present-day city of Tampa, Florida. He was appointed Adjutant General in August 1821, but this appointment was not confirmed by the Senate, causing it to expire the following year. Historical Register and Dictionary of the US Army =Seminole expulsion= Gadsden next decided to quit the U.S. Army, and became a planter in Florida; he served in the Florida Territorial Legislature. Gadsden was appointed as a commissioner during 1823 to help with the organization and the expulsion of most of the Seminole Indian Tribe from their homes in Florida and southern Georgia, along the so-called \\"Trail of Tears\\" to land reservations that had been reserved for them in what is now Oklahoma. Years later Gadsden County, Florida, was named in his honor, and also the city of Gadsden, Alabama, and the town of Gadsden, Arizona. =Railroad executive= Later Gadsden served as the president of the South Carolina Railroad company from 1840 to 1850. When first completed in 1833, the line was the longest railroad in the world under one management. As an engineer he directed the construction of the branch to Columbia, completed 1842, surveyed a proposed extension to the Ohio River, and helped promote the Memphis & Charleston Railroad, incorporated 1845 (completed in 1857, it was the first U. S. railroad link between the Atlantic and the Mississippi River, but long after Gadsden had turned his attention elsewhere). By 1846, Gadsden and his associates promoted the construction of a southern transcontinental railroad from the Atlantic to the Pacific Oceans. He urged Georgia and South Carolina to abandon their rivalry and to \\"discover their true policy in the harmony of a fee and unrestricted trade.\\" A late 1840s map shows this railroad would hypothetically have been by way of the southern route from Charleston through Georgia, Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana, and Texas to El Paso, Texas, and then through Mexico to the coast, in what in a few years would be newly acquired American land, after the 1846-1848 war with Mexico. In 1852, the SCRR followed the philosophy laid out by Gadsden during his tenure and moved the railroad's terminus from Hamburg, South Carolina, signaling the end of South Carolina's focus on economic sovereignty. Much of the boundary between the United States and Mexico had been left unreasonably vague by the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo that had been signed and ratified by the United States and Mexico during 1848. Gadsden would play an important role in revising the boundary, with the aim to build a southern transcontinental railroad (see below and the article on the Gadsden Purchase). =California= During 1850, Gadsden advocated secession by South Carolina when California was admitted to the Union as a free state. Gadsden considered slavery \\"a social blessing\\" and abolitionists \\"the greatest curse of the nation.\\"Richards p. 125. When the secession proposal failed, Gadsden, working with his cousin Isaac Edward Holmes, a lawyer in San Francisco since 1851, and the California state senator Thomas Jefferson Green, attempted to divide California in two. They proposed that the southern half would allow slavery. Gadsden planned to establish a slaveholding colony there based on rice, cotton, and sugar. He would use slave labor to build a railroad and highway, originating in either San Antonio or on the Red River, that would transport people to the California gold fields. Toward this end, on December 31, 1851, Gadsden asked Green to secure from the California state legislature a large land grant located between the 34th and 36th parallels; it would eventually serve as the dividing line for the two California states.Richards p. 126. A few months after this, Gadsden and 1,200 potential settlers from South Carolina and Florida submitted a petition to the California legislature for permanent citizenship and permission to establish a rural district that would be farmed by \\"not less than Two Thousand of their African Domestics\\". The petition stimulated some debate, but it finally expired in committee.Richards p. 127. =Gadsden Purchase= Following the war between Mexico and the United States, disputes over the boundary line brought the two nations near to renewed conflict in the Mesilla Valley of New Mexico, north of El Paso. In May 1853, President Franklin Pierce appointed Gadsden as the Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary to Mexico, with instructions to purchase more land from Mexico as part of a settlement of the Mesilla controversy, for the prospective railroad route across southernmost parts of what are today New Mexico and Arizona, to end the possibility of disputes concerning control of the Apache along the border, and other more minor issues. Gadsden successfully performed this mission by negotiating with the Mexican government in Mexico City for the purchase of more land from Mexico for southmost New Mexico and Arizona, and by establishing the boundary between the United States and Mexico as two long line segments between the Rio Grande at the westmost tip of Texas all the way to the River Colorado at the eastern boundary of California. This treaty is known as the \\"Gadsden Treaty\\", and it resulted in the Gadsden Purchase from Mexico of about of land in northmost Mexico for $10,000,000. In the fall of 1856 Gadsden retired as minister to Mexico, and returned to Charleston where he died in 1858. The sectional crisis of the late 1850s and subsequent Civil War delayed construction of a proposed southern transcontinental railroad to California along the 32d parallel, just to the north of the Mexican border. Between 1878 and 1881, though, the Southern Pacific Railroad (now part of the Union Pacific Railroad) built the section of the southern transcontinental between Yuma and El Paso within the Gadsden Purchase territory. At the same time, 1880-1882, the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railroad completed a transcontinental link through the Gadsden Purchase and then southwest to a terminus at the port of Guaymas, in the state of Sonora, Mexico. Completed October 25, 1882, this line was later acquired by the Southern Pacific. Today, the rail link across the Gadsden Purchase on the southern transcontinental is one of the busiest in the Western Hemisphere. The land bought by the Gadsden Purchase contained the site of Arizona's second largest city, Tucson, a one-time Spanish presidio town, the minor cities and towns of Casa Grande, and Yuma, Arizona, Lordsburg, Deming, New Mexico, and New Mexico's second largest metro area at Las Cruces, New Mexico, in the Mesilla Valley, and it defined the status of the area north of the Gila River, that later became the metropolitan area of Phoenix, Scottsdale, Mesa, Glendale, and Tempe, Arizona. Most of the land south of Phoenix where tentative plans had been made to build a transcontinental railroad is desert land that is not suitable for much human inhabitation. Nearly all of this federally owned land was eventually reserved as a large, sparsely inhabited American Indian reservation, testing and combat-practice ranges for the U.S. Air Force, Organ Pipe Cactus National Monument, Cabeza Prieta National Wildlife Refuge, Coronado National Forest, Sonoran Desert National Monument, Ironwood Forest National Monument, Saguaro National Park, and the Fort Huachuca Military Reservation of the U.S. Army. Gadsden was buried in St. Philips Church Cemetery in Charleston, South Carolina.  Further reading  * Richards, The California Gold Rush and the Coming of the Civil War. (2007) .

He distinguished himself very greatly in Wittgenstein's campaign, and in particular at Polotsk (18 and 19 October), after which combat he was raised to the rank of major- general. In the latter part of the campaign he served against the Prussian contingent of General Yorck (von Wartenburg), with whom, through Clausewitz, he negotiated the celebrated convention of Tauroggen, serving thereafter with Yorck in the early part of the German Campaign of 1813. After the battle of L√ºtzen he served in Silesia and took part in negotiating the secret treaty of Reichenbach. Having distinguished himself at the battles of Dresden and Leipzig he was promoted lieutenant-general. At the crisis of the campaign of 1814 he strongly urged the march of the allies on Paris; and after their entry the emperor Alexander conferred on him the order of St Alexander Nevsky. In 1815 he attended the Congress of Vienna, and was afterwards made adjutant- general to the emperor, with whom, as also with his successor Nicholas, he had great influence. By Nicholas he was created baron, and later count. In 1820 he had become chief of the general staff, and in 1825 he assisted in suppressing the Decembrist revolt. His greatest exploits were in the Russo-Turkish War of 1828‚Äì1829, which, after a period of doubtful contest, was decided by Diebitsch's brilliant campaign of Adrianople; this won him the rank of field- marshal and the victory title of Zabalkanski to commemorate his crossing of the Balkans. In 1830 he was appointed to command the great army destined to suppress the November Uprising in Poland. After the inconclusive battle of Grochow on 25 February, he won the battle of Ostro≈Çƒôka on 26 May, but soon afterwards died of cholera at Kleszewo near Pu≈Çtusk, on 10 June 1831.

(; from 'renovation, renewal') - also called Renovationist Church, () or the Living Church, () -, officially named Orthodox Russian Church (), and later Orthodox Church in USSR (), was a schism in the Russian Orthodox Church in 1922‚Äì1946. This movement originally begun as a \\"grass-roots\\" movement among the Russian clergy for the reformation of the Church, but was quickly corrupted by the support of the Soviet secret services (CheKa, then GPU, NKVD), which had hoped to split and weaken the Russian Church by instigating schismatic movements within it.Robert Service, A History of Modern Russia, from Nicholas II to Putin p 135 The beginning of actual schism is usually considered to be in May 1922, when a group of \\"Renovationist\\" clergy laid claims to higher ecclesiastical authority in the Russian Church. The movement is considered to have ended with the death of its leader, Alexander Vvedensky, in 1946. While the entire movement is often known as the Living Church, this was specifically the name of just one of the groups that comprised the larger Renovationist movement. By the time of the \\"Moscow Council\\" of 1923, three major groups had formed within the movement, representing different tendencies within Russian Renovationism: 1) The Living Church of Fr. Vladimir Krasnitsky (1880‚Äì1936), lobbied for the interests of married clergy; 2) the Union of the Communities of the Ancient Apostolic Church () of Fr. Alexander Vvedensky; and 3) the Union for the Renewal of the Church () ‚Äì the group of bishop Antonin (Granovsky), whose interest was in liturgical reform; 4) several minor groups.  History of the Renovationist Church  = Beginnings and first period (1920s‚Äì1930s)= The origins of Renovationism can be traced to wide debates concerning possible church reforms, among both clergy and laity, of the Russian Orthodox Church in the beginning of the 20th century. These debates obviously stemmed from dissatisfaction with the position of the Church in the Russian Empire, where it was subservient to the interests of the imperial administration. These debates came to fruition only with the overthrow of the monarchy in the Russian Revolution, when, in November 1917, the Great Moscow Council was convened, and the Patriarchate eventually restored. However, the events of the Russian Revolution of 1917 caused the more left-leaning of the clergy to consider the Great Moscow Council as not being radical enough. They insisted that the Church was to adapt to the realities of the new Communist regime, to revise its attitude toward socialist doctrine, and to make significant changes in its own canonical and liturgical tradition. In March 1917, before the Bolshevik Revolution, a group of clerics in St. Petersburg formed the Union of the Democratic Clergy and Laity with an essentially Christian Socialist program. After November 1917, the Christian Socialist position had moved many reform-minded clergy to profess full loyalty to the newly established Soviet regime and opposition to Patriarch Tikhon, who had condemned its atheistic activities. Very soon, Soviet authorities, especially its secret services (VChK (Cheka), later GPU) took interest in these \\"Renovationist\\" groups, seeing in them the possibility of splitting and weakening the Russian Orthodox Church. This cooperation between the Renovationists and the Communist regime led to direct schism, largely orchestrated and supported by the Communist authorities, from the patriarchal Church. At the beginning of the 1920s, Soviet authorities initiated a large campaign of persecution and repression against the Russian Orthodox Church‚Äîmany priests and bishops were arrested and executed, including St. Veniamin, Metropolitan of Petrograd (+1922). Patriarch Tikhon (Bellavin) was put under house arrest in 1922 and preparations were made for a Bolshevik-style \\"show trial\\". In such a situation, in May 1922, Tikhon commissioned Archbishop Agathangel (Preobrazhensky) of Yaroslavl to carry out patriarchal duties. With Agathangel delayed in Yaroslavl by Soviet authorities, a group of reform-oriented Orthodox clergy seized the chancery offices of the Patriarchate and proclaimed themselves to be the Higher Church Administration (–í—ã—Å—à–µ–µ —Ü–µ—Ä–∫–æ–≤–Ω–æ–µ —É–ø—Ä–∞–≤–ª–µ–Ω–∏–µ), the highest ecclesiastical authority in the Church. The first President of the HCA was the retired bishop Antonin (Granovsky; 1865‚Äì1927) -‚Äì a highly learned, but eccentric cleric, soon elevated by the Renovationists to Metropolitan of Moscow. Not surprisingly, the new \\"administration\\" had soon received recognition from the Soviet government. This move was quickly (18 June 1922) denounced by Agathangel as unlawful and uncanonical. However, for a brief time it seemed that the Renovationists had gotten the upper hand. The Renovationists, with full support of Soviet authorities, seized many church buildings and monasteries, including the famous Cathedral of Christ the Saviour in Moscow. In many dioceses, the \\"white\\" (married) clergy was encouraged to take church government into their own hands, without approval of their diocesan bishops. Simultaneously, these bishops were often threatened and pressed to recognize the authority of the HCA. In effect, this resulted in \\"parallel\\" church administrations existing in one diocese and one city, one supporting the HCA and the other supporting the canonical bishop. This campaign of terror had its effects: by the summer of 1922, more than 20 hierarchs had recognized the canonical authority of HCA, the most notorious of whom was Metropolitan Sergius (Stragorodsky) of Nizhny Novgorod, the future Patriarch. In many large cities, all of Orthodox church properties were in the hands of Renovationists. Before convening any general council to discuss their measures, the Renovationists began to implement radical reforms aimed at what they perceived to be the interests of the married clergy. Among the measures, changing the traditional order of ecclesiastic life were: :* Permission for monastics (including bishops) to marry, while retaining their episcopal and clerical ranks; :* Permission for the Clergy to marry after their ordination, to remarry or to marry widows; :* Permission for the married priests to be consecrated as bishops (Christian Orthodox tradition is that only monastics may be Bishops). The last decision sparked a number of consecrations of \\"married bishops\\" throughout the country, especially in Siberia. As a result of its promulgation, of 67 bishops that arrived to the Second Moscow Council in April 1923, only 20 had been ordained before the schism. The consecration of the \\"married bishops\\" without waiting for a conciliar decision on changing appropriate Canons met with opposition even among many Renovationist leaders and those \\"married bishops\\" later received a second laying on of hands before the Council opened. The I Renovationist or \\"II All-Russian\\" Council met in Moscow in 29 April ‚Äì 8 May 1923. It mostly confirmed the decisions concerning changes in the canonical rules of ordinations and clerical marriage, which had already been implemented in many dioceses. Its most controversial and infamous decision was to put Patriarch Tikhon (who was under house arrest, awaiting trial) on ecclesiastic trial in absentia for his opposition to Communism, and to strip him of his episcopacy, priesthood and monastic status. The Council then resolved to abolish the Patriarchate altogether and to return to the \\"collegial\\" form of church government. Considering Russian historical practices, this would have made the Church officially a department of the government. Patriarch Tikhon refused to recognize the authority of this Council and the validity of the \\"court\\" decision, due to many irregularities in canonical procedure: essentially, the decision had no effect on the life of the Patriarchal or \\"Tikhonite\\" Church. The telling blow against Renovationism was the return of Patriarch Tikhon to active duty in June 1923 when, under international pressure, he was released from house arrest. Already by that time, large passive resistance to the Renovationists, especially in rural areas, had undermined their efforts to \\"take over\\" the Russian Church. On 15 July 1923, the Patriarch declared all Renovationist decrees, as well as all their sacramental actions (including ordinations) to be without grace, due to the \\"trickery\\" by which they tried to seize power in the Church and to their complete disregard for the canons. In August 1923, the council of Russian Orthodox bishops, returned from exile and imprisonment, confirmed Tikhon‚Äôs decision, proclaiming the Renovationist hierarchy as \\"unlawful and without grace\\". Some of the churches were returned to the \\"Tikhonites\\" (as Renovationists called the \\"Patriarchal\\" Church at that time), and many bishops and priests who had been pressed to support the schism, repented and were received back into communion. In August 1923, a power struggle among the factions of the Renovationist Synod resulted in the forced resignation of Metropolitan Antonin Granovsky. Antonin retired to the church in Moscow that was occupied by his group (\\"Union of Church Renewal\\") and, reverting to his previous title of \\"bishop\\", engaged in a series of radical liturgical experiments: e.g., moving the altar table to the middle of the church, etc. He made one of the first translations of the Divine Liturgy into modern Russian. Eventually, he broke communion with the Renovationist church at large and died unreconciled with both sides of the schism. His group disintegrated after his death in 1927. In addition to ecclesiological experimentation, the 1920s, the Renovationist Church had some activity in the fields of education and apologetics. Particularly, in 1924 the church was allowed to open two institutions of higher learning: the Moscow Theological Academy and the Theological Institute in Leningrad. Some contacts were made with other portions of the Christian East: thus, the II Renovationist Council (a.k.a. III All-Russian Council), convened in Moscow in 1‚Äì9 October 1925, was marked by the presence of the representatives from the Patriarchates of Constantinople and Alexandria who concelebrated the eucharist with other members of the Renovationist Synod. In the second half of the 1920s, the canonical Russian Orthodox Church started making steps toward some form of rapprochement with the Soviet regime. Significantly, in 1927, the Deputy Patriarchal Locum Tenens, Metropolitan Sergius Stragorodsky issued a \\"Declaration\\" proclaiming absolute loyalty of the Church to the Soviet government and its interests. Subsequently, a Synod formed by Sergius, received recognition from the Soviets. This had effectively put the Renovationist Synod out of place as the chief spokesman for the alliance between the Church and the Soviet state, and it was then that the Renovationist movement began its rapid decline. =Second period (1930s‚Äì1940s)= By the mid-1930s the general failure of the movement had become evident. Having failed to attract the majority of the faithful, the movement ceased to be useful for the Soviet regime and, consequently, both the \\"Patriarchal\\" Church and the Renovationists suffered fierce persecution at the hands of Soviet secret services: church buildings were closed down and often destroyed; active clergy and laity were imprisoned and sometimes executed. At the same time, trying to \\"win back\\" more traditional Russian Orthodox, the church had abandoned all attempts at ecclesiastical or liturgical reform, with the exception of the concessions previously made to married clergy. Instead, the Renovationist Church made attempts at imitating external liturgical and organizational forms of their opponents from the \\"Patriarchal\\" Church. In 1934, the Renovationist Synod issued an infamous decision declaring the \\"allegiance to the old church\\" (—Å—Ç–∞—Ä–æ—Ü–µ—Ä–∫–æ–≤–Ω–∏—á–µ—Å—Ç–≤–æ), i.e., the Patriarchal Church, to be a \\"heresy\\" and a \\"schism\\". The mastermind behind that \\"ingenious\\" decision, Metropolitan Nikolai (Platonov) of Leningrad resigned from episcopacy in 1938, publicly denounced the faith and became an infamous propagator of atheism. The Renovationist church continued to dwindle in numbers, the process which had intensified since 1939 when the Synod forbade the diocesan bishops to do any priestly ordinations without its approval. The final blow to the movement came with the beginning of the Second World War in 1941. The Metropolitan‚Äôs residence had to be relocated due to evacuation. Therefore, the Synod had difficulties contacting and controlling its clergy in the parishes. More importantly, in its efforts to seek moral and financial support from the Eastern Orthodox Church, Joseph Stalin decided to turn to the more popular and traditional Russian Orthodox Church led by Sergius, rather than to its largely unsuccessful rivals. On 8 September 1943, Stalin met with three chief hierarchs of the \\"Patriarchal\\" Church and promised to make concessions to the Church and religion in general in exchange for its allegiance and support. One of the effects of this unlikely concordat was that the days of the Renovationist movement were numbered. What followed was a deluge of Renovationist clerics seeking reconciliation with Sergius. As a general rule, the Patriarchal Church considered all sacraments celebrated by Renovationists \\"null and void\\", hence these receiving clergy were received in those orders in which they happened to be upon the moment when they joined the schism (i.e. 1922). The only exception was made for Metropolitan Alexander Vvedensky, who was regarded as the ‚Äòfather-founder‚Äô of the schism. Vvedensky refused to come into the Moscow Patriarchy as a layman and died unreconciled. In 1943, the Renovationist church had 13 active hierarchs and 10 more bishops, retired or in exile. By 1945, there were only 3 bishops left, one of whom was retired. In Moscow, only one church remained under Renovationist control ‚Äì the rest of the church properties had been returned by the Soviet government to the Moscow Patriarchy while Vvedensky was in evacuation. Vvedensky died of stroke on July 8, 1946, with his church in complete disarray. This date is generally considered to be the end of the Renovationist schism.  Leadership and administration  The central administrative body of the Renovationist Church, as well as its entire administration, was in a state of constant flux and changed names several times in the 28-year period of its existence. Initially it was called the Higher Church Administration (–í—ã—Å—à–µ–µ —Ü–µ—Ä–∫–æ–≤–Ω–æ–µ —É–ø—Ä–∞–≤–ª–µ–Ω–∏–µ), then Higher Church Council (1922‚Äì23). Thereafter it assumed a more traditional style: The Holy Synod of the Orthodox Church in the USSR (1923‚Äì1933). Its President was usually considered a chief hierarch of the church, regardless of the see which he occupied. In its later years, the Renovationist administration started to lean more toward more \\"traditionalist\\" titles. In 1933, the position of the First Hierarch (–ü–µ—Ä–≤–æ–∏–µ—Ä–∞—Ä—Ö) was introduced, in opposition to the \\"Tikhonite\\" Church, which was not to have a Patriarch until 1943. The position was given to the then-President of Synod Vitaly Vvedensky, however since mid-1920s all power in the Renovationist Church had consolidated in the hands of its actual leader, Metropolitan Alexander Vvedensky. Toward the latter part of the 1930s, A. Vvedensky bore a very peculiar conglomerate of titles, invented specially for him: Metropolitan - Apologete- Evangelizer and Deputy First Hierarch. In the fall of 1941 he himself assumed the title of the First Hierarch and made an abortive attempt to declare himself a Patriarch of all Orthodox Churches in the USSR. The attempt was not received well by his fellow clergy and in December 1941 he reverted to his previous titles. = The Chief Hierarchs of the Renovationist Church = The hierarchs in the position of official leaders of the Renovationist Church in 1922‚Äì1946 were: * Metropolitan Antonin (Granovsky) of Moscow - 15 May 1922 ‚Äì 25 June 1923 (+ 1927) * Metropolitan Yevdokim (Meschersky) of Odessa - 26 June 1923 ‚Äì February 1925 (+ 1935) * Metropolitan Benjamin (Muratovsky) of Moscow and Kolomna - February 1925 ‚Äì 6 May 1930 * Metropolitan Vitaly (Vvedensky) of Tula - President of the Synod 10 May 1930 ‚Äì 1933; First Hierarch 5 May 1933- 6 October 1941 (+ 1950) * Metropolitan Alexander (Vvedensky) - Deputy First Hierarch April 1940 ‚Äì October 1941; First Hierarch 10 October 1941 ‚Äì 8 August 1946; \\"Patriarch\\" (?) October‚ÄìDecember 1941  Evaluation  While it had among its ranks many sincere and faithful clerics, the Renovationist movement from the very start revealed its major weaknesses, which effectively undermined its entire appeal for the church \\"renovation\\". Its support by the Soviet government did not help advancing its cause. On the contrary, Renovationists met with the massive \\"grass-roots\\" resistance from \\"Tikhonite\\" churchmen and laity, who regarded the \\"Living Church\\" as agents of Soviet secret services. Likewise, relaxation of canonical restrictions with respect to clerical marriage led many to regard the entire movement as driven mainly by the unsatisfied ambition of married priests. The dubious moral stature of many Renovationist leaders ‚Äì such as Vvedensky (married three times, with many extramarital affairs) or Platonov (a GPU agent and, eventually, an apostate) ‚Äì certainly tarnished the image of the \\"Renovationist Church\\" in the eyes of the faithful. Modern church historians generally regard the Renovationist movement as a deviation from more sincere and well-founded attempts at ecclesiastical reforms in the beginning of the 20th century. While initially the reforms were indeed at the heart of at least some Renovationism, later it was the issue of unending loyalty \\"at all cost\\" to the Soviet regime which became the major point of separation. When, eventually, the Patriarchal Church had found ways for some rapprochement with the Soviet power, the raison-d‚Äô√™tre for the schism ceased to exist and it went into decline.

He was a delegate to the Continental Congress. a brigadier general in the Continental Army during the American Revolutionary War, Lieutenant Governor of South Carolina, a merchant, and the designer of the Gadsden flag. Early life Gadsden was born in 1724 in Charleston, South Carolina. He was the son of Thomas Gadsden, who had been in the Royal Navy before becoming customs collector for the port of Charleston. Christopher was sent to school near Bristol, England. He returned to America in 1740 and served as an apprentice at a counting house in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. He inherited a large fortune from his parents who died in 1741. From 1745 to 1746 he was a purser on a British warship during King George's War. He entered into mercantile ventures, and by 1747 had earned enough to return to South Carolina and buy back the land his father had sold because he needed the money to pay off debts. He built Beneventum Plantation House in about 1750. There, although he showed ambivalence towards slavery, he kept slaves and traded them for use on his property as was common practice among plantation owners in South Carolina. =Seven Years War= National Park Service marker depicting Gadsden Wharf Gadsden began his rise to prominence as a merchant and patriot in Charleston. He prospered as a merchant, and built the wharf in Charleston that still bears his name. He was captain of a militia company during a 1759 expedition against the Cherokee. He was first elected to the Commons House of Assembly in 1757, and began a long friction with autocratic royal governors. In 1766 the assembly made him one of their delegates to the Stamp Act Congress in New York City, which was called to protest the Stamp Act. While his fellow delegates Thomas Lynch and John Rutledge served on committees to draft appeals to the House of Lords and Commons respectively, Gadsden refused any such assignment, since in his view the British parliament had no rights in the matter. He addressed himself with outspoken support for the Declaration of Rights produced by the Congress. His addresses brought him to the attention of Samuel Adams of Massachusetts, and the two began a long correspondence and friendship. Gadsden was eventually known as \\"the Sam Adams of the South\\". Revolutionary years Gadsden flag On his return from New York, Gadsden became one of the founders and leaders of the Charleston Sons of Liberty. He had risen to the rank of lieutenant colonel in the militia. He was elected as a delegate to the First Continental Congress in 1774 and the Second Continental Congress the following year. He left Congress early in 1776 to assume command of the 1st South Carolina Regiment of the Continental Army and to serve in the Provincial Congress of South Carolina. In February 1776, South Carolina President John Rutledge named him a brigadier general in charge of the state's military forces. As the British prepared to attack Charleston, Major General Charles Lee ordered outlying positions abandoned. Rutledge and the local officers disagreed. A compromise was reached and as William Moultrie prepared the defenses on Sullivan's Island, Gadsden paid for, and his regiment built, a bridge that would allow their escape if the position were threatened. The British attack was repulsed. In 1778, Gadsden was a member of the South Carolina convention that drafted a new state constitution. That same year he was named the Lieutenant Governor, to replace Henry Laurens who was away at the Continental Congress. He would serve in that office until 1780. Actually, for the first year and a half his office was called \\"Vice President of South Carolina,\\" but when the new constitution was adopted, the title was changed to the modern usage. When the British laid siege to Charleston in 1780, John Rutledge, as president of the council, fled to North Carolina to ensure a \\"government in exile\\" should the city fall. Gadsden remained, along with Governor Rawlins Lowndes. General Benjamin Lincoln surrendered the Continental Army garrison on May 12 to General Sir Henry Clinton. At the same time, Gadsden represented the civil government and surrendered the city. He was sent on parole to his Charleston house. =Prisoner of war= After General Sir Henry Clinton returned to New York, the new British commander in the South, General Cornwallis, changed the rules. On the morning of August 27, he arrested about 20 of the civil officers then on parole. They were marched as prisoners to a ship and taken to St. Augustine, Florida. When they arrived, Governor Tonyn offered the freedom of the town if they would give their parole. Most accepted, but Gadsden refused claiming that the British had already violated one parole, and he could not give his word to a false system. As a result, he spent the next 42 weeks in solitary confinement in a prison room at the old Spanish fortress of Castillo de San Marcos. When they were finally released in 1781, they were sent by merchant ship to Philadelphia. Once there, Gadsden learned of the defeat of Cornwallis' subordinate Banastre Tarleton at Cowpens and Cornwallis' subsequent movement to Yorktown. Gadsden hurried home to help the restoration of South Carolina's civil government. Later life Christopher Gadsden built the three-story house at 329 East Bay Street in 1798.Gadsden was returned to South Carolina's House of Representatives, then meeting at Jacksonboro. At this session, Governor Randolph and de facto President Rutledge both surrendered their offices. Gadsden was elected as the governor, but felt he had to decline. His health was still impaired from his imprisonment, and an active governor was needed since the British had not yet given up Charleston. So in 1782, John Mathews became the new governor. Gadsden was also a member of the state convention in 1788 and voted for ratification of the United States Constitution. In 1798, he built the imposing house at 329 East Bay Street in the Ansonborough area of Charleston that remained in the family for more than a century; famous iron worker Philip Simmons built the gates that incorporate a snake motif, drawn from the \\"Don't Tread on Me\\" flag that Gadsden designed. Gadsden was married three times, and had four children by his second wife. The Gadsden Purchase of Arizona was named for his grandson James Gadsden. Another grandson, Christopher E. Gadsden, was the fourth Episcopal Bishop of South Carolina. Gadsden died from an accidental fall on August 28, 1805, in Charleston, and is buried there in St. Philip's Churchyard.

He also served as the quorum's acting president from 1994 to 2008, and was an apostle and member of the Quorum of the Twelve from 1970 until his death. He served as a general authority of the church from 1961 until his death. Background and education Packer was born on September 10, 1924, in Brigham City, Utah, the tenth of eleven children born to Ira Wight Packer and Emma Jensen. As a young boy, he contracted polio. After graduating from high school, he enlisted in the United States Army Air Forces in the spring of 1943. He graduated as a pilot in September 1944 and was assigned to bomber training. He was on Okinawa when World War II ended, and his unit remained stationed on Japan until 1946. After leaving the military, Packer initially attended Weber College (now Weber State University), where he met his future wife, Donna Smith.Greg Hill, \\"Develop courage, Pres. Packer counsels\\", Deseret News, November 17, 2008. They married in the Logan Temple in 1947 and had ten children, including emeritus LDS general authority Allan F. Packer. After their marriage, Packer attended Utah State University, earning a B.S. degree in 1949 and an M.S. degree in 1953. He later earned an Ed.D. from Brigham Young University in 1962. Packer was also an artist, and enjoyed painting, particularly birds. LDS Church employment and service In his career as an educator, Packer worked in the LDS Church's Church Educational System, where he held various administrative positions overseeing seminary and institute programs, including as assistant supervisor of the church's Native American seminary programs, general assistant administrator of seminaries and institutes, and later as supervisor of church's seminaries and institutes. Packer served a four-year term on the Brigham City City Council.Don L. Searle, \\"Elder Boyd K. Packer: Disciple of the Master Teacher\\", Ensign, June 1986. In 1961, Packer was called by LDS Church president David O. McKay to serve as a general authority as an Assistant to the Twelve, a position that no longer exists.Gerry Avant, \\"President Packer is at half-century milestone of service\\", Church News, October 1, 2011. Retrieved October 5, 2011. While serving in the position, Packer was assigned to serve as president of the church's New England States Mission. He also served for a time as the managing director of the church's military relations committee. Following McKay's death in January 1970, Packer, then 45 years old, was called by new church president Joseph Fielding Smith as a member of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles at the church's April 1970 general conference. Between 1979 and 1981, he was on the committee that produced the new editions of the LDS Church scriptures. On September 12, 1991, Packer dedicated Ukraine \\"for the preaching of the restored gospel.\\"Marina Mikhailovskaya and Benjamin Gaines, \\"Putting Family First in Ukraine,\\" Ensign, September 2004, p. 46. In 1993, Packer read the dedicatory prayer in the Spanish language at the dedication of the San Diego California Temple.Church News, May 1, 1993. When Howard W. Hunter, who had been President of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles, succeeded to the presidency of the church in 1994, he called Gordon B. Hinckley and Thomas S. Monson as his counselors in the First Presidency. Packer was the fourth apostle in seniority among the ranks of the church, behind Hunter, Hinckley and Monson. This created a situation where the only apostles senior to Packer were members of the First Presidency. As a result, Packer was named Acting President of the Quorum of the Twelve. When Hunter died in 1995 and was succeeded by Hinckley, Monson was again retained in the First Presidency and Packer was again asked to be Acting President of the Twelve. Of the five acting presidents of the Quorum in the church's history, Packer served the longest in that capacity and is the only one to serve under two different church presidents. In 1999, Packer dedicated the Regina Saskatchewan Temple.Regina Saskatchewan LDS (Mormon) Temple, ldschurchtemples.com. Packer became President of the Quorum of the Twelve on February 3, 2008, when Monson became church president. In 2012, Packer dedicated the Brigham City Utah Temple.\\"Brigham City Utah LDS Temple,\\" ldschurchtemples.com.Carole Mikita, \\"LDS Church members participate in Brigham City temple dedication\\", KSL, 23 September 2012. Teachings and legacy Packer was well known for several talks and teachings, and several of his stories have been adapted into short films. His sermon about singing a hymn to drive off bad thoughts was adapted into the video Worthy Thoughts.Ezra Taft Benson has acknowledged that this idea originated with Packer: see Ezra Taft Benson, \\"Think on Christ\\", Ensign, March 1989. His Parable of the Mediator (Jesus Christ) was adapted into the short film \\"The Mediator\\". \\"The Candle of the Lord\\" (1982) is well known for its analogy of trying to describe what salt tastes like to trying to describe what promptings from the Holy Ghost are like.Boyd K. Packer, \\"The Candle of the Lord\\", Ensign, January 1983. Packer also taught the importance of hymn-centered prelude music for worship services. Packer served as an advisor to the Genesis Group,Lloyd, R. Scott. \\"Revelation rewarded those who waited\\", Church News, December 18, 1999. a social organization of the LDS Church for African-American members and their families, and was also active in obtaining genealogical records on microfilm for the church through its Genealogical Society of Utah. In 1977, Packer was a key figure in getting Native American-related records filmed from the federal records centers in Los Angeles, Fort Worth, Seattle, and Kansas City.Allen, James B., Jessie L. Embry and Kahlile B. Mehr. Hearts Turned to the Fathers: A History of the Genealogical Society of Utah, 1894‚Äì1994 (Provo, Utah: BYU Studies, 1995) p. 247. He was involved in negotiations that same year with archivists and scholars at Jerusalem to microfilm Jewish records.Allen. Hearts Turned to the Fathers. pp. 250‚Äì51. In a General Conference Priesthood Session in October 1976, Packer gave a sermon entitled \\"To Young Men Only\\", in which he discouraged boys of the Young Men organization in the Aaronic priesthood from pursuing activities which the LDS Church defines as immoral, including masturbation, the use of pornography, and homosexual activities.Packer, Boyd K. \\"To Young Men Only\\" (published 1980). The sermon has been criticized for encouraging homophobia and gay bashing.D.

Further comments by Packer during his October 2010 address, \\"Cleansing the Inner Vessel\\", which echoed his views on homosexuality given in a 1978 speech, concerning whether homosexuality is an individual choice, generated a petition by the Human Rights Campaign. The church responded to this petition by reaffirming its doctrinal position on gay marriage while reiterating the universal need to follow \\"Jesus Christ's second great commandment‚Äîto love one another.\\"\\"Full text of Boyd K.

Packer's talk\\", ksl.com, October 8, 2010. In 2013, amid a nationwide shift toward acceptance and legalization of same-sex marriage, Packer attracted some attention for comments critical of \\"legalized acts of immorality\\" and warning of a \\"tolerance trap.\\" Packer advocated that Mormon historians should refrain from discussing history that does not promote faith. In a 1981 speech to educators in the LDS Church Educational System, he cautioned, \\"There is a temptation for the writer or teacher of Church history to want to tell everything, whether it is worthy or faith promoting or not. Some things that are true are not very useful.\\". Arguing that teachers should \\"give milk before meat\\", (apparently referring to 1 Cor. 3:2). he stated that \\"some things are to be taught selectively and some things are to be given only to those who are worthy.\\". Packer's opinion applied to all historians who were members of the LDS Church: he stated, \\"One who chooses to follow the tenets of his profession, regardless of how they may injure the Church or destroy the faith of those not ready for 'advanced history', is himself in spiritual jeopardy. If that one is a member of the Church, he has broken his covenants and will be held accountable.\\". Packer's comments raised criticism by some prominent Mormon and non-Mormon scholars. Soon after Packer's 1981 speech, Mormon historian D. Michael Quinn gave a speech highly critical of Packer's views, and suggested that a historian who followed Packer's advice would sacrifice their honesty and professional integrity. (\\"If I were to write about any subject unrelated to religion, and I purposely failed to make reference to pertinent information of which I had knowledge, I would be justifiably criticized for dishonesty. What is true outside of religion is equally true in writing religious history.\\"). Quinn also discussed what he viewed as a Mormon tradition of portraying LDS leaders as infallible people. C. Robert Mesle has criticized Packer as having created a false dichotomy \\"between the integrity of faith and the integrity of inquiry.\\".

Packer was also interviewed by PBS for its documentary on the LDS Church titled The Mormons. Death Packer died at his home on July 3, 2015, from causes incident to age. At the time of his death, he was the second-most senior apostle among the ranks of the church and the fifth-longest serving general authority in the church's history.

Measure-preserving systems obey the Poincar√© recurrence theorem, and are a special case of conservative systems. They provide the formal, mathematical basis for a broad range of physical systems, and, in particular, many systems from classical mechanics (in particular, most non-dissipative systems) as well as systems in thermodynamic equilibrium. Definition A measure-preserving dynamical system is defined as a probability space and a measure-preserving transformation on it. In more detail, it is a system :(X, \\\\mathcal{B}, \\\\mu, T) with the following structure: *X is a set, *\\\\mathcal B is a œÉ-algebra over X, *\\\\mu:\\\\mathcal{B}\\\\rightarrow[0,1] is a probability measure, so that Œº(X) = 1, and Œº(‚àÖ) = 0, * T:X \\\\rightarrow X is a measurable transformation which preserves the measure \\\\mu, i.e., \\\\forall A\\\\in \\\\mathcal{B}\\\\;\\\\; \\\\mu(T^{-1}(A))=\\\\mu(A) . Discussion One may ask why the measure preserving transformation is defined in terms of the inverse \\\\mu(T^{-1}(A))=\\\\mu(A) instead of the forward transformation \\\\mu(T(A))=\\\\mu(A). This can be understood in a fairly easy fashion. Consider a mapping \\\\mathcal{T} of power sets: :\\\\mathcal{T}:P(X)\\\\to P(X) Consider now the special case of maps \\\\mathcal{T} which preserve intersections, unions and complements (so that it is a map of Borel sets) and also sends X to X (because we want it to be conservative). Every such conservative, Borel-preserving map can be specified by some surjective map T:X\\\\to X by writing \\\\mathcal{T}(A)=T^{-1}(A). Of course, one could also define \\\\mathcal{T}(A)=T(A), but this is not enough to specify all such possible maps \\\\mathcal{T}. That is, conservative, Borel- preserving maps \\\\mathcal{T} cannot, in general, be written in the form \\\\mathcal{T}(A)=T(A). Obviously! one might say; consider, for example, the map of the unit interval T:[0,1) \\\\to [0,1) given by x \\\\mapsto 2x\\\\mod 1; this is the Bernoulli map. Note that \\\\mu(T^{-1}(A)) has the form of a pushforward, whereas \\\\mu(T(A)) is generically called a pullback. Almost all properties and behaviors of dynamical systems are defined in terms of the pushforward. For example, the transfer operator is defined in terms of the pushforward of the transformation map T; the measure \\\\mu can now be understood as an invariant measure; it is just the Frobenius‚ÄìPerron eigenvector of the transfer operator (recall, the FP eigenvector is the largest eigenvector of a matrix; in this case it is the eigenvector which has the eigenvalue one: the invariant measure.) There are two classification problems of interest. One, discussed below, fixes (X, \\\\mathcal{B}, \\\\mu) and asks about the isomorphism classes of a transformation map T. The other, discussed in transfer operator, fixes (X, \\\\mathcal{B}) and T, and asks about maps \\\\mu that are measure-like. Measure- like, in that they preserve the Borel properties, but are no longer invariant; they are in general dissipative and so give insights into dissipative systems and the route to equilibrium. In terms of physics, the measure-preserving dynamical system (X, \\\\mathcal{B}, \\\\mu, T) often describes a physical system that is in equilibrium, for example, thermodynamic equilibrium. One might ask: how did it get that way? Often, the answer is by stirring, mixing, turbulence, thermalization or other such processes. If a transformation map T describes this stirring, mixing, etc. then the system (X, \\\\mathcal{B}, \\\\mu, T) is all that is left, after all of the transient modes have decayed away. The transient modes are precisely those eigenvectors of the transfer operator that have eigenvalue less than one; the invariant measure \\\\mu is the one mode that does not decay away. The rate of decay of the transient modes are given by (the logarithm of) their eigenvalues; the eigenvalue one corresponds to infinite half-life. Informal example The microcanonical ensemble from physics provides an informal example. Consider, for example, a fluid, gas or plasma in a box of width, length and height w\\\\times l\\\\times h, consisting of N atoms. A single atom in that box might be anywhere, having arbitrary velocity; it would be represented by a single point in w\\\\times l\\\\times h\\\\times \\\\mathbb{R}^3. A given collection of N atoms would then be a single point somewhere in the space (w\\\\times l\\\\times h)^N \\\\times \\\\mathbb{R}^{3N}. The \\"ensemble\\" is the collection of all such points, that is, the collection of all such possible boxes (of which there are an uncountably-infinite number of). This ensemble of all-possible-boxes is the space X above. In the case of an ideal gas, the measure \\\\mu is given by the Maxwell‚ÄìBoltzmann distribution. It is a product measure, in that if p_i(x,y,z,v_x,v_y,v_z)\\\\,d^3x\\\\,d^3p is the probability of atom i having position and velocity x,y,z,v_x,v_y,v_z, then, for N atoms, the probability is the product of N of these. This measure is understood to apply to the ensemble. So, for example, one of the possible boxes in the ensemble has all of the atoms on one side of the box. One can compute the likelihood of this, in the Maxwell‚ÄìBoltzmann measure. It will be enormously tiny, of order \\\\mathcal{O}\\\\left(2^{-3N}\\\\right). Of all possible boxes in the ensemble, this is a ridiculously small fraction. The only reason that this is an \\"informal example\\" is because writing down the transition function T is difficult, and, even if written down, it is hard to perform practical computations with it. Difficulties are compounded if the interaction is not an ideal-gas billiard-ball type interaction, but is instead a van der Waals interaction, or some other interaction suitable for a liquid or a plasma; in such cases, the invariant measure is no longer the Maxwell‚ÄìBoltzmann distribution. The art of physics is finding reasonable approximations. This system does exhibit one key idea from the classification of measure-preserving dynamical systems: two ensembles, having different temperatures, are inequivalent. The entropy for a given canonical ensemble depends on it's temperature; as physical systems, it is \\"obvious\\" that when the temperatures differ, so do the systems. This holds in general: systems with different entropy are not isomorphic. Examples Example of a (Lebesgue measure) preserving map: T : [0,1) ‚Üí [0,1), x \\\\mapsto 2x \\\\mod 1. Unlike the informal example above, the examples below are sufficiently well-defined and tractable that explicit, formal computations can be performed. * Œº could be the normalized angle measure dŒ∏/2œÄ on the unit circle, and T a rotation. See equidistribution theorem; * the Bernoulli scheme; * the interval exchange transformation; * with the definition of an appropriate measure, a subshift of finite type; * the base flow of a random dynamical system; * the flow of a Hamiltonian vector field on the tangent bundle of a closed connected smooth manifold is measure-preserving (using the measure induced on the Borel sets by the symplectic volume form) by Liouville's theorem (Hamiltonian); * for certain maps and Markov processes, the Krylov‚ÄìBogolyubov theorem establishes the existence of a suitable measure to form a measure-preserving dynamical system. Generalization to groups and monoids The definition of a measure- preserving dynamical system can be generalized to the case in which T is not a single transformation that is iterated to give the dynamics of the system, but instead is a monoid (or even a group, in which case we have the action of a group upon the given probability space) of transformations Ts : X ‚Üí X parametrized by s ‚àà Z (or R, or N ‚à™ {0}, or [0, +‚àû)), where each transformation Ts satisfies the same requirements as T above. In particular, the transformations obey the rules: * T_0 = \\\\mathrm{id}_X :X \\\\rightarrow X, the identity function on X; * T_{s} \\\\circ T_{t} = T_{t + s}, whenever all the terms are well-defined; * T_{s}^{-1} = T_{-s}, whenever all the terms are well-defined. The earlier, simpler case fits into this framework by defining Ts = Ts for s ‚àà N. Homomorphisms The concept of a homomorphism and an isomorphism may be defined. Consider two dynamical systems (X, \\\\mathcal{A}, \\\\mu, T) and (Y, \\\\mathcal{B}, u, S). Then a mapping :\\\\varphi:X \\\\to Y is a homomorphism of dynamical systems if it satisfies the following three properties: # The map \\\\varphi\\\\ is measurable. # For each B \\\\in \\\\mathcal{B}, one has \\\\mu (\\\\varphi^{-1}B) = u(B). # For Œº-almost all x \\\\in X, one has \\\\varphi(Tx) = S(\\\\varphi x). The system (Y, \\\\mathcal{B}, u, S) is then called a factor of (X, \\\\mathcal{A}, \\\\mu, T). The map \\\\varphi\\\\; is an isomorphism of dynamical systems if, in addition, there exists another mapping :\\\\psi:Y \\\\to X that is also a homomorphism, which satisfies # for Œº-almost all x \\\\in X, one has x = \\\\psi(\\\\varphi x); # for ŒΩ-almost all y \\\\in Y, one has y = \\\\varphi(\\\\psi y). Hence, one may form a category of dynamical systems and their homomorphisms. Generic points A point x ‚àà X is called a generic point if the orbit of the point is distributed uniformly according to the measure. Symbolic names and generators Consider a dynamical system (X, \\\\mathcal{B}, T, \\\\mu), and let Q = {Q1, ..., Qk} be a partition of X into k measurable pair- wise disjoint pieces. Given a point x ‚àà X, clearly x belongs to only one of the Qi. Similarly, the iterated point Tnx can belong to only one of the parts as well. The symbolic name of x, with regards to the partition Q, is the sequence of integers {an} such that :T^nx \\\\in Q_{a_n}. The set of symbolic names with respect to a partition is called the symbolic dynamics of the dynamical system. A partition Q is called a generator or generating partition if Œº-almost every point x has a unique symbolic name. Operations on partitions Given a partition Q = {Q1, ..., Qk} and a dynamical system (X, \\\\mathcal{B}, T, \\\\mu), define the T-pullback of Q as : T^{-1}Q = \\\\\\\\{T^{-1}Q_1,\\\\ldots,T^{-1}Q_k\\\\\\\\}. Further, given two partitions Q = {Q1, ..., Qk} and R = {R1, ..., Rm}, define their refinement as : Q \\\\vee R = \\\\\\\\{Q_i \\\\cap R_j \\\\mid i=1,\\\\ldots,k,\\\\ j=1,\\\\ldots,m,\\\\ \\\\mu(Q_i \\\\cap R_j) > 0 \\\\\\\\}. With these two constructs, the refinement of an iterated pullback is defined as : \\\\begin{align} \\\\bigvee_{n=0}^N T^{-n}Q & = \\\\\\\\{Q_{i_0} \\\\cap T^{-1}Q_{i_1} \\\\cap \\\\cdots \\\\cap T^{-N}Q_{i_N} \\\\\\\\\\\\ & {} \\\\qquad \\\\mbox { where }i_\\\\ell = 1,\\\\ldots,k ,\\\\ \\\\ell=0,\\\\ldots,N,\\\\ \\\\\\\\\\\\ & {} \\\\qquad \\\\qquad \\\\mu \\\\left (Q_{i_0} \\\\cap T^{-1}Q_{i_1} \\\\cap \\\\cdots \\\\cap T^{-N}Q_{i_N} \\\\right )>0 \\\\\\\\} \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\end{align} which plays crucial role in the construction of the measure-theoretic entropy of a dynamical system. Measure-theoretic entropy The entropy of a partition \\\\mathcal{Q} is defined as :H(\\\\mathcal{Q})=-\\\\sum_{Q \\\\in \\\\mathcal{Q}}\\\\mu (Q) \\\\log \\\\mu(Q). The measure-theoretic entropy of a dynamical system (X, \\\\mathcal{B}, T, \\\\mu) with respect to a partition Q = {Q1, ..., Qk} is then defined as :h_\\\\mu(T,\\\\mathcal{Q}) = \\\\lim_{N \\\\rightarrow \\\\infty} \\\\frac{1}{N} H\\\\left(\\\\bigvee_{n=0}^N T^{-n}\\\\mathcal{Q}\\\\right). Finally, the Kolmogorov‚ÄìSinai metric or measure-theoretic entropy of a dynamical system (X, \\\\mathcal{B},T,\\\\mu) is defined as :h_\\\\mu(T) = \\\\sup_Q h_\\\\mu(T,Q). where the supremum is taken over all finite measurable partitions. A theorem of Yakov Sinai in 1959 shows that the supremum is actually obtained on partitions that are generators. Thus, for example, the entropy of the Bernoulli process is log 2, since almost every real number has a unique binary expansion. That is, one may partition the unit interval into the intervals [0, 1/2) and [1/2, 1]. Every real number x is either less than 1/2 or not; and likewise so is the fractional part of 2nx. If the space X is compact and endowed with a topology, or is a metric space, then the topological entropy may also be defined. Classification and anti-classification theorems One of the primary activities in the study of measure-preserving systems is their classification according to their properties. That is, let (X, \\\\mathcal{B}, \\\\mu) be a measure space, and let U be the set of all measure preserving systems (X, \\\\mathcal{B}, \\\\mu, T). An isomorphism S\\\\sim T of two transformations S, T defines an equivalence relation \\\\mathcal{R}\\\\subset U\\\\times U. The goal is then to describe the relation \\\\mathcal{R}. A number of classification theorems have been obtained; but quite interestingly, a number of anti-classification theorems have been found as well. The anti-classification theorems state that there are more than a countable number of isomorphism classes, and that a countable amount of information is not sufficient to classify isomorphisms. The first anti-classification theorem, due to Hjorth, states that if U is endowed with the weak topology, then the set \\\\mathcal{R} is not a Borel set. There are a variety of other anti-classification results. For example, replacing isomorphism with Kakutani equivalence, it can be shown that there are uncountably many non-Kakutani equivalent ergodic measure-preserving transformations of each entropy type. These stand in contrast to the classification theorems. These include: * Ergodic measure-preserving transformations with a pure point spectrum have been classified. * Bernoulli shifts are classified by their metric entropy. See Ornstein theory for more.

In mammals, the meninges are the dura mater, the arachnoid mater, and the pia mater. Cerebrospinal fluid is located in the subarachnoid space between the arachnoid mater and the pia mater. The primary function of the meninges is to protect the central nervous system. Structure =Dura mater= The dura mater () (also rarely called meninx fibrosa or pachymeninx) is a thick, durable membrane, closest to the skull and vertebrae. The dura mater, the outermost part, is a loosely arranged, fibroelastic layer of cells, characterized by multiple interdigitating cell processes, no extracellular collagen, and significant extracellular spaces. The middle region is a mostly fibrous portion. It consists of two layers: the endosteal layer, which lies closest to the skull, and the inner meningeal layer, which lies closer to the brain. It contains larger blood vessels that split into the capillaries in the pia mater. It is composed of dense fibrous tissue, and its inner surface is covered by flattened cells like those present on the surfaces of the pia mater and arachnoid mater. The dura mater is a sac that envelops the arachnoid mater and surrounds and supports the large dural sinuses carrying blood from the brain toward the heart. The dura has four areas of infolding: * Falx cerebri, the largest, sickle-shaped; separates the cerebral hemispheres. Starts from the frontal crest of frontal bone and the crista galli running to the internal occipital protuberance. * Tentorium cerebelli, the second largest, crescent- shaped; separates the occipital lobes from cerebellum. The falx cerebri attaches to it giving a tentlike appearance. * Falx cerebelli, vertical infolding; lies inferior to the tentorium cerebelli, separating the cerebellar hemispheres. * Diaphragma sellae, smallest infolding; covers the pituitary gland and sella turcica. Diagram of brain layers =Arachnoid mater= Diagram of section of top of brain showing the meninges and subarachnoid space The middle element of the meninges is the arachnoid mater, or arachnoid membrane, so named because of its resemblance to a spider web. It cushions the central nervous system. This thin, transparent membrane is composed of fibrous tissue and, like the pia mater, has an outer layer of tightly packed flat cells, forming the arachnoid barrier. The shape of the arachnoid does not follow the convolutions of the surface of the brain and so looks like a loosely fitting sac. In particular, in the region of the brain a large number of fine filaments called arachnoid trabeculae pass from the arachnoid through the subarachnoid space to blend with the tissue of the pia mater. The arachnoid barrier has no extracellular collagen and is considered to represent an effective morphological and physiological meningeal barrier between the cerebrospinal fluid and subarachnoid space and the blood circulation in the dura. The arachnoid barrier layer is characterized by a distinct continuous basal lamina on its inner surface toward the innermost collagenous portion of the arachnoid reticular layer. =Pia mater= The pia mater (Entry \\"pia mater\\" in Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary, retrieved 2015-11-27.) is a very delicate membrane. It is the meningeal envelope that firmly adheres to the surface of the brain and spinal cord, following all of the brain's contours (the gyri and sulci). It is a very thin membrane composed of fibrous tissue covered on its outer surface by a sheet of flat cells thought to be impermeable to fluid. The pia mater is pierced by blood vessels to the brain and spinal cord, and its capillaries nourish the brain. =Leptomeninges= The arachnoid and pia mater together are sometimes called the leptomeninges, literally \\"thin meninges\\" ( \\"leptos\\"‚Äî\\"thin\\"). Acute meningococcal meningitis can lead to an exudate within the leptomeninges along the surface of the brain. Because the arachnoid is connected to the pia by cob-web like strands, it is structurally continuous with the pia, hence the name pia-arachnoid or leptomeninges. They are responsible for the production of beta-trace protein (prostaglandin D2 synthase), a major cerebrospinal fluid protein. =Subarachnoid space= Diagram of section of spinal cord showing the meninges and spaces. Subarachnoid space coloured blue The subarachnoid space is the space that normally exists between the arachnoid and the pia mater, which is filled with cerebrospinal fluid, and continues down the spinal cord. Spaces are formed from openings at different points along the subarachnoid space; these are the subarachnoid cisterns, which are filled with cerebrospinal fluid. The dura mater is attached to the skull, whereas in the spinal cord, the dura mater is separated from the vertebrae by a space called the epidural space, which contains fat and blood vessels. The arachnoid is attached to the dura mater, while the pia mater is attached to the central nervous system tissue. When the dura mater and the arachnoid separate through injury or illness, the space between them is the subdural space. There is a subpial space underneath the pia mater that separates it from the glia limitans. Clinical significance Injuries involving the meninges, can result in a hemorrhage and two types of hematoma. *A subarachnoid hemorrhage is acute bleeding under the arachnoid; it may occur spontaneously or as a result of trauma. *A subdural hematoma is a hematoma (collection of blood) located in a separation of the arachnoid from the dura mater. The small veins that connect the dura mater and the arachnoid are torn, usually during an accident, and blood leaks into this area. *An epidural hematoma, bleeding between the dura mater and the skull, may arise after an accident or spontaneously. Other medical conditions that affect the meninges include meningitis (usually from a fungal, bacterial, or viral infection) and meningiomas that arise from the meninges, or from meningeal carcinomatoses (tumors) that form elsewhere in the body and metastasize to the meninges. Other animals In fish, there is a single membrane known as the primitive meninx. Amphibians, and reptiles have two meninges, and birds and mammals have three. In the early 1900s, Giuseppe Sterzi, an Italian anatomist, carried out comparative studies on the meninges from the lancelet to the human. Contrary to previous reports, the spinal meninges were seen to be very simple, both in the adult lower vertebrates and in the early developmental stages of the more advanced vertebrates. From the mesenchyme surrounding the neural tube only a single leaflet forms the primitive meninx. In the following phylogenetic and ontogenetic stages, the latter divides into an internal leaflet: the secondary meninx, and into an external one: the dura mater. Finally, in higher vertebrates, even the secondary meninx divides into the arachnoid and the pia. In the same animals, Sterzi demonstrated that, while in the spinal medulla the dura keeps its identity, in the skull it fuses with the periosteum. He also demonstrated the continuity of all meninges with the envelopes of nerves and with the filum terminale. Mammals (as higher vertebrates) retain the dura mater, and the secondary meninx divides into the arachnoid and pia mater.

Originally published in 1986, it is the first book of the Redwall series. The book was illustrated by Gary Chalk, with the British cover illustration by Pete Lyon and the American cover by Troy Howell. It is also one of the three Redwall novels to be made into a TV series. Plot summary A young mouse named Matthias is a novice monk at Redwall Abbey, where he was adopted as a young orphan, though he dreams of a life of adventure, inspired by the legends of Martin the Warrior, the founder of Redwall. One summer, Redwall Abbey is surrounded by the army of Cluny the Scourge, an infamously evil one-eyed rat. Matthias is guided by visions of Martin the Warrior, while the abbey inhabitants prepare the defense of their home against Cluny's impending attack. Matthias seeks Martin's famous sword, supposedly hidden somewhere within the abbey, helped particularly by Methuselah, an ancient and grizzled mouse who serves as Redwall's historian. Cluny, meanwhile, attempts to gain entrance to the abbey and murders a defector from his horde: Sela the fox. Sela's son, Chickenhound, seeks refuge at Redwall but ends up accidentally killing Methuselah after being caught stealing. Driven from the abbey, Chickenhound is maimed in the wilderness by the venomous adder Asmodeus Poisonteeth, a local terror in Mossflower Wood, the forest that surrounds the abbey. Clues to the location of Martin's sword and shield have been built into the abbey, allowing Matthias to recover the shield, though he discovers the sword has been stolen by a wild sparrow tribe, the Sparras, that dwell on Redwall's roof. He learns from the violent sparrows that the sword was stolen from them in turn by Asmodeus. The king of the sparrows attacks Matthias but dies when the two plummet together off the abbey roof. Matthias recovers and ventures to Asmodeus's lair with his new allies Log-a-Log, a shrew, and Warbeak Sparra, the new and just queen of the aforementioned Sparras. Matthias, Log-a-Log, and two other Shrews succeed in retrieving the sword from Asmodeus's cave, Asmodeus kills the latter two, and Matthias subsequently kills Asmodeus. Alerted to the fall of the abbey by the Sparra tribe, Matthias rushes back to Redwall to save his friends. The Redwall inhabitants have been using boiling water, oil, barrels of hornets, and fire to repel Cluny's horde, but the abbey finally falls when Cluny threatens the family of the gatekeeper, who allows Cluny's forces access to the abbey. Matthias, his allies now including the Mossflower shrews and the whole Sparra tribe, along with the newly captive Redwall population, battle against Cluny's minions. Cluny strikes his poison-barb tail at the father abbot, Mortimer, but Matthias quickly avenges the abbot's injury by dropping the abbey's giant bell on top of Cluny, crushing him to death and cracking the bell in the process. Abbot Mortimer proclaims Matthias the Warrior of Redwall and dies from his wound. The battle ends in victory for the defenders of Redwall. An epilogue reveals that Matthias has married the fieldmouse Cornflower and she has given birth to their son, Mattimeo, an abbreviated version of the name Matthias Methuselah Mortimer. The cracked Joseph Bell has been reshaped into two new bells: the Matthias Bell and the Methuselah Bell.  Discrepancies  As Redwall was the first book set in the Redwall world, many of the defining traits of the world had not yet been hammered out, and are different from all subsequent books in the series: = The world = *Redwall appeared to take place in the real world. Cluny was referred to as a Portuguese water rat at one point. Additionally, Methuselah claimed that one of the accounts of Cluny comes from a town dog. The horse present in the early chapters was the size of a normal horse, and the wagon it pulled was scaled to the same size ‚Äì an entire army of rats was able to ride in it. Also there was a mention of cows that trampled through a village. However, Brian Jacques did not expect the book to be published, and excluded references to humans and many larger animals in later books. * Aside from the setting of the story‚Äîan Abbey with an abbot but no apparent religious observances‚Äîthe St. Ninian's Church is the only reference to any kind of religion in any of the Redwall series, implying that at one point the residents of Mossflower practised Christianity. (Although later in the series, it is rumoured that originally, the sign outside the church said \\"This ain't Ninian's!\\", and some of the letters wore away.) Jacques firmly stated that the inhabitants of Redwall Abbey practice no religion of any kind.Q&A; with Brian Jacques, page 3, redwall.org. Retrieved 25 August 2013.Q&A; with Brian Jacques, page 4, redwall.org. Retrieved 25 August 2013. Cluny and his soldiers also mention Satan (\\"by Satan's nose\\" or \\"Hell's teeth\\"), referring to a belief in Hell. No other religious mentionings have happened in any of the later books. However, evil characters sometimes use the word \\"Hellgates\\" as a reference to death or dying. Dark Forest's Gates, or just Dark Forest refers to a place characters' souls go after death. = Species discrepancy = *Redwall is the only book in the entire series that makes any mention of domesticated animals. Animals mentioned in this book ‚Äì but never again in the series ‚Äì include horse, dog, cow, and pig. Additionally, the Abbot mentions a \\"village where the dog and pigs reside\\", perhaps implying human habitation. In the books following this, the world of Redwall is inhabited only by wild fauna. However, in Eulalia! an owl refers to a cow in a song he sings. Moreover, various kinds of milks and cheeses are consumed by the inhabitants of Redwall, though no direct description of such farming or manufacture is ever made. *The beaver in Redwall is the only one to appear in the entire series. Its species has not been mentioned since. *Bees can communicate in Redwall, indicated by a statement at the end of the book where the Guerilla Shrews learned to speak the bee language so they could trade and argue. This was not noted in other books. *Foxes are indicated in Redwall as not inherently evil. It is mentioned that Abbot Mortimer used to trade tomes with \\"wandering healer foxes\\". Sela the vixen's brood of foxes was referred to as a bad lot, indicating that they were an exception and not the norm. In all later books, foxes are a \\"vermin\\" species. *Brother Methuselah mentions that it was Martin who gave the first Foremole his title; however, in Mossflower, Foremole is already known as such before Martin's arrival, though this is most likely because Mossflower, Martin's debut book, was published after Redwall. *In Redwall, the cat is scaled to real life compared to Matthias and Constance the Badger is depicted pulling a cart by herself, but in later books, badgers and wildcats are roughly the size of the other animals (if large). *In Redwall, Guosim was a character, a member of the Guerilla Shrews. In later books, the shrews themselves were referred to as the Guosim, and no mention of the character Guosim was made, even in Mattimeo. The Shrews did not rename themselves after her, either, indicated by the fact that they were referred to as Guosim in books chronologically earlier than Redwall. Furthermore, while the shrews appear in Redwall as an independent tribe with no alliance with the other \\"good\\" creatures, in books chronologically earlier they are shown as frequent allies. Log-a-Log, in addition, is always shown as their chief, while he is a mere ferry-shrew in Redwall. The customs of the tribe also changed dramatically: In Redwall the Guosim are democratic and the actions of the tribe are carried out by votes. In the books following, there is no voting, in fact the actions of the tribe fall primarily on the chieftain's decision.

The screenplay, written by Karen McCullah Lutz and Kirsten Smith, is a modernization of William Shakespeare's late-16th-century comedy The Taming of the Shrew, retold in a late-1990s American high school setting. In the story, new student Cameron (Gordon-Levitt) is smitten with Bianca (Oleynik) and, in order to get around her father's strict rules on dating, attempts to get bad boy Patrick (Ledger) to date Bianca's ill-tempered sister, Kat (Stiles). The film is titled after a poem written by Kat about her bittersweet romance with Patrick. Much of the filming took place in the Seattle metropolitan area, with many scenes shot at Stadium High School in Tacoma. Released March 31, 1999, 10 Things I Hate About You was number two at the domestic box office during its opening weekend, behind only The Matrix, and was a moderate financial and critical success. It was a breakthrough role for Stiles, Ledger, and Gordon-Levitt, all of whom were nominated for various teen-oriented awards. Ten years later, the film was adapted into a television series of the same title, which ran for twenty episodes and featured Larry Miller reprising his role as Walter Stratford from the film. Plot Cameron James, a new student at Padua High School in the Seattle area, becomes instantly smitten with popular sophomore Bianca Stratford. Geeky Michael Eckman warns him that Bianca is vapid and conceited, and that her overprotective father does not allow Bianca or her older sister, the shrewish Kat, to date. Kat, a senior, is accepted to Sarah Lawrence College in New York, but her father, Walter, wants her to stay close to home. Bianca wishes to date affluent senior Joey Donner, but Walter, an obstetrician worrisome of teenage pregnancy, will not allow his daughters to date until they graduate. Frustrated by Bianca's insistence and Kat's rebelliousness, Walter declares that Bianca may date only when Kat does, knowing that Kat's antisocial attitude makes this unlikely. When Cameron asks Bianca out, she informs him of her father's new rule and, as a pretense for allowing her to date Joey, suggests that Cameron find someone willing to date Kat. Cameron selects \\"bad boy\\" Patrick Verona, but Patrick scares him off. Michael assists by convincing Joey to pay Patrick to take out Kat, under the pretense that this will allow Joey to date Bianca. Patrick agrees to the deal, but Kat rebuffs his first few advances. Michael and Cameron help him by prying Bianca for information on Kat's likes and dislikes. Armed with this knowledge, Patrick begins to win Kat's interest. She goes to a party with him, which enables Bianca to go as well, much to Walter's dismay. At the party, Kat becomes upset when she sees Bianca with Joey, and responds by getting drunk. Patrick attends to her, and Kat starts to open up, expressing her interest in starting a band. However, when she tries to kiss him, Patrick pulls away and Kat leaves, infuriated. Meanwhile, Bianca ignores Cameron in favor of Joey, leaving Cameron dejected. Bianca soon realizes, however, that Joey is shallow and self-absorbed, and asks Cameron for a ride home. Cameron admits his feelings for her and his frustration with how she has treated him. Bianca responds by kissing him. Joey offers to pay Patrick to take Kat to the prom so he can take Bianca. Patrick initially refuses, but relents when Joey offers him more money. Kat is still angry with Patrick, but he wins her over by serenading her with the accompaniment of the marching band, and she helps him sneak out of detention. They go on a date which turns romantic, but Kat becomes suspicious and angry when Patrick insists that she go with him to the prom, an event she is adamantly against. Bianca is irritated that Cameron hasn't asked her to the prom, and so accepts Joey's invitation, but Walter won't allow it unless Kat goes too. Kat confesses to Bianca that she dated Joey when they were freshmen and, succumbing to peer pressure, had sex with him. Afterward she regretted it and Joey dumped her, so she vowed to never again do anything just because everyone else was doing it. Bianca insists that she can make her own choices, so Kat agrees to go to the prom with Patrick, and Bianca decides to go with Cameron instead of Joey. All is going well at the prom until Bianca learns that Joey planned to have sex with her that night. Angry that Bianca has spurned him for Cameron, Joey reveals his arrangement with Patrick, which causes Kat to leave heartbroken. Joey then punches Cameron, but is in turn beaten up by Bianca for having hurt her, Kat, and Cameron. Bianca and Cameron share another kiss. The next day, Bianca reconciles with Kat and begins dating Cameron. Walter admits that Kat is capable of taking care of herself, and gives her permission to attend Sarah Lawrence College. For an assignment in which the students were required to write their own version of William Shakespeare's Sonnet 141, Kat reads aloud a poem titled \\"10 Things I Hate About You\\", revealing that she still loves Patrick. Patrick surprises her with a guitar bought with the money that Joey paid him, and confesses that he has fallen for her. Kat forgives him, and the two reconcile with a kiss.

Paresthesia may be transient or chronic, and may have any of dozens of possible underlying causes. Paresthesias are usually painless and can occur anywhere on the body, but most commonly occur in the arms and legs. The most familiar kind of paresthesia is the sensation known as \\"pins and needles\\" after having a limb 'fall asleep'. A less well-known and uncommon but important paresthesia is formication, the sensation of insects crawling underneath the skin. Causes =Transient= Paresthesias of the hands, feet, legs and arms are common, transient symptoms. The briefest, electric shock type of paresthesia can be caused by tweaking the ulnar nerve near the elbow. Similar brief shocks can be experienced when any other nerve is tweaked (a tweaked neck nerve may cause a brief shock-like paresthesia toward the scalp). In the older age group, spinal column irregularities may tweak the spinal cord briefly when the head or back is turned, flexed, or extended into brief uncommon positions (Lhermitte's sign). The most common, everyday cause is temporary restriction of nerve impulses to an area of nerves, commonly caused by leaning or resting on parts of the body such as the legs (often followed by a pins and needles tingling sensation). Other causes include conditions such as hyperventilation syndrome and panic attacks. A cold sore outside the mouth (not a canker sore inside the mouth) can be preceded by tingling because a cold sore is caused by herpes simplex virus. The varicella zoster virus (shingles) also notably may cause recurring pain and tingling in skin or tissue along the distribution path of that nerve (most commonly in the skin, along a dermatome pattern, but sometimes feeling like a headache, chest or abdominal pain, or pelvic pain). Other common examples occur when sustained pressure has been applied over a nerve, inhibiting or stimulating its function. Removing the pressure typically results in gradual relief of these paresthesias.Paresthesia Information Page: National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke. (NINDS) Most pressure-induced paraesthesia results from awkward posture, such as engaging in cross-legged sitting for prolonged periods of time. Reactive hyperaemia, which occurs when blood flow is restored after a period of ischemia, such as on rewarming after a cold episode in patients with Raynaud's disease, may be accompanied by paresthesia. =Chronic= Chronic paresthesia (Berger's paresthesia,[ICD-10: R20.2] Sinagesia[ICD-10: R25.1] or Bernhardt paresthesia[ICD-10: G57.1]) indicates a problem with the functioning of neurons or poor circulation. In older individuals, paresthesia is often the result of poor circulation in the limbs (such as in peripheral vascular disease), most often caused by atherosclerosis, the build up of plaque within artery walls, over decades, with eventual plaque ruptures, internal clots over the ruptures and subsequent clot healing but leaving behind narrowing of the artery openings or closure, both locally and in downstream smaller branches. Without a proper supply of blood and nutrients, nerve cells can no longer adequately send signals to the brain. Because of this, paresthesia can also be a symptom of vitamin deficiency and malnutrition, as well as metabolic disorders like diabetes, hypothyroidism, and hypoparathyroidism. It can also be a symptom of mercury poisoning. Irritation to the nerve can also come from inflammation to the tissue. Joint conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, and carpal tunnel syndrome are common sources of paresthesia. Nerves below the head may be compressed where chronic neck and spine problems exist and can be caused by, among other things, muscle cramps that may be a result of clinical anxiety or excessive mental stress, bone disease, poor posture, unsafe heavy lifting practices or physical trauma such as whiplash. Paresthesia can also be caused simply by putting pressure on a nerve by applying weight (or pressure) to the limb for extended periods of time. Another cause of paresthesia may be direct damage to the nerves themselves, i.e., neuropathy, which itself can stem from injury, such as frostbite, or infection, such as Lyme disease, or may be indicative of a current neurological disorder. Neuropathy is also a side effect of some chemotherapies (see chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy). Benzodiazepine withdrawal may also cause paresthesia as the drug removal leaves the GABA receptors stripped bare and possibly malformed. Chronic paresthesia can sometimes be symptomatic of serious conditions, such as a transient ischemic attack, or autoimmune diseases such as multiple sclerosis, Complex Regional Pain Syndrome or lupus erythematosus. The use of fluoroquinolones can also cause paresthesia. Stroke survivors and those with traumatic brain injury (TBI) may experience paresthesia from damage to the central nervous system. The varicella zoster virus disease (shingles) can attack nerves causing numbness instead of pain commonly associated with shingles. =Acroparesthesia= Acroparesthesia is severe pain in the extremities, and may be caused by Fabry disease, a type of sphingolipidosis. It can also be a sign of hypocalcemia. =Dentistry= Paresthesia or \\"persistent anesthesia\\" is a transient or potentially permanent condition of extended numbness after administration of local anesthesia and the injected anesthetic has terminated.Paresthesia dental definition: The Free Dictionary. (TheFreeDictionary) Potential causes include trauma introduced to the nerve sheath during administration of the injection, hemorrhage about the sheath, type of anesthetic used, or administration of anesthetic potentially contaminated with alcohol or sterilizing solutions. =Other= Other causes may include: * Anticonvulsant pharmaceutical drugs, such as topiramate, sultiame, and acetazolamide * Anxiety or panic disorder * Autonomous sensory meridian response (\\"ASMR\\") * Benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome * Beta alanine * Blood pressure medications * Carpal tunnel syndrome * Cerebral amyloid angiopathy * Chiari malformation * Coeliac disease (celiac disease) * Complex regional pain syndrome * Decompression sickness * Dehydration * Dextromethorphan (recreational use) * Fabry disease * Erythromelalgia * Fibromyalgia * Fluoroquinolone toxicity * Guillain‚ÄìBarr√© syndrome (GBS) * Heavy metals * Herpes zoster * Hydroxy alpha sanshool, a component of Sichuan peppers * Hyperglycemia (high blood sugar) * Hyperkalemia * Hyperventilation * Hypoglycemia (low blood sugar) * Hypocalcemia, and in turn: ** Hypermagnesemia, a condition in which hypocalcemia itself is typically observed as a secondary symptom * Hypothyroidism * Immunodeficiency, such as chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP) * Intravenous administering of strong pharmaceutical drugs acting on the central nervous system (CNS), mainly opioids, opiates, narcotics; especially in non-medical use (drug abuse) * Ketorolac * Lidocaine poisoning * Lomotil * Lupus erythematosus * Lyme disease * Magnesium deficiency, often as a result of long term proton-pump inhibitor use * Menopause * Mercury poisoning * Migraines * Multiple sclerosis * Nerve compression syndrome * Nitrous oxide, long-term exposureNitrous Oxide * Obdormition * Oxygen toxicity, especially, breathing oxygen under pressure, such as in scuba diving. * Pyrethrum and pyrethroid (pesticide)Vijverberg, H.P., van den Bercken, J.

A MRI or a CT scan is sometimes used to rule out some causes from the central nervous system. Treatment Medications offered can include the immunosuppressant prednisone, intravenous gamma globulin (IVIG), anticonvulsants such as gabapentin or Gabitril and antiviral medication, depending on the underlying cause. In addition to treatment of the underlying disorder, palliative care can include the use of topical numbing creams, such as lidocaine or prilocaine. Care must be taken to apply only the necessary amount, as excess can contribute to the condition. Otherwise, these products offer extremely effective, but short-lasting, relief from the condition. Paresthesia caused by stroke may receive some temporary benefit from high doses of Baclofen multiple times a day. HIV patients who self- medicate with cannabis report that it reduces their symptoms. Paresthesia caused by shingles is treated with appropriate antiviral medication. Etymology The word paresthesia (; British English paraesthesia; plural paraesthesiae or paraesthesias), comes from the Greek para (\\"beside\\", i.e., abnormal) and aisthesia (\\"sensation\\").

Symptoms may range from subtle to obvious. Symptoms may include vomiting or a baby that will not settle. Often there are no visible signs of trauma. Complications include seizures, visual impairment, cerebral palsy, and cognitive impairment. The cause may be blunt trauma or vigorous shaking. Often this occurs as a result of a caregiver becoming frustrated due to the child crying. Diagnosis can be difficult as symptoms may be nonspecific. A CT scan of the head is typically recommended if a concern is present. While retinal bleeding is common, it can also occur in other conditions. Abusive head trauma is a type of child abuse. Educating new parents appears to be beneficial in decreasing rates of the condition. Treatment occasionally requires surgery, such as to place a cerebral shunt. AHT is estimated to occur in 3 to 4 per 10,000 babies a year. It occurs most frequently in those less than five years of age. The risk of death is about 25%. The diagnosis may also carry legal consequences for the parents. Signs and symptoms Characteristic injuries associated with AHT include retinal bleeds, multiple fractures of the long bones, and subdural hematomas (bleeding in the brain). These signs have evolved through the years as the accepted and recognized signs of child abuse. Medical professionals strongly suspect shaking as the cause of injuries when a young child presents with retinal bleed, fractures, soft tissue injuries or subdural hematoma, that cannot be explained by accidental trauma or other medical conditions.B.G.Brogdon, Tor Shwayder, Jamie Elifritz Child Abuse and its Mimics in Skin and Bone Retinal bleeds occur in around 85% of AHT cases; the type of retinal bleeds are particularly characteristic of this condition, making the finding useful in establishing the diagnosis. While there are many other causes of retinal bleeds besides AHT, there are usually additional findings (eyes or systemic) which make the alternative diagnoses apparent. Fractures of the vertebrae, long bones, and ribs may also be associated with AHT. Dr. John Caffey reported in 1972 that metaphyseal avulsions (small fragments of bone torn off where the periosteum covering the bone and the cortical bone are tightly bound together) and \\"bones on both the proximal and distal sides of a single joint are affected, especially at the knee\\". Infants may display irritability, failure to thrive, alterations in eating patterns, lethargy, vomiting, seizures, bulging or tense fontanels (the soft spots on a baby's head), increased size of the head, altered breathing, and dilated pupils.Types of brain injury: Shaken baby syndrome . Brain Injury Association of America. Retrieved on September 24, 2007. Risk factors Caregivers that are at risk for becoming abusive often have unrealistic expectations of the child and may display \\"role reversal\\", expecting the child to fulfill the needs of the caregiver. Substance abuse and emotional stress, resulting for example from financial troubles, are other risk factors for aggression and impulsiveness in caregivers. Both males and females can cause AHT. Although it had been previously speculated that AHT was an isolated event, evidence of prior child abuse is a common finding. In an estimated 33‚Äì40% of cases, evidence of prior head injuries, such as old intracranial bleeds, is present. Mechanism Effects of AHT are diffuse axonal injury, oxygen deprivation and swelling of the brain, which can raise pressure inside the skull and damage delicate brain tissue. Traumatic shaking occurs when a child is shaken in such a way that its head is flung backwards and forwards. In 1971, Guthkelch, a neurosurgeon, hypothesized that such shaking can result in a subdural hematoma, in the absence of any detectable external signs of injury to the skull. The article describes two cases in which the parents admitted that for various reasons they had shaken the child before it became ill. Moreover, one of the babies had retinal hemorrhages. The association between traumatic shaking, subdural hematoma and retinal hemorrhages was described in 1972 and referred to as whiplash shaken infant syndrome. The injuries were believed to occur because shaking the child subjected the head to acceleration‚Äìdeceleration and rotational forces. In 1987, this theory was queried in a biomechanical study which concluded that isolated shaking, in the absence of direct violence, is probably not of sufficient force to cause the injuries described as part of the triad. It has been suggested that the mechanism of ocular abnormalities is related to vitreoretinal traction, with movement of the vitreous contributing to development of the characteristic retinal bleeds, although this has been challenged.Vitreoretinal traction is a major factor in causing the haemorrhagic retinopathy of abusive head injury? ‚Äì No Eye, Clarke M.P. These eye findings correlate well with intracranial abnormalities.Post Mortem Findings =Force= There has been controversy regarding the amount of force required to produce the brain damage seen in AHT. There is broad agreement, even amongst skeptics, that shaking of a baby is dangerous and can be fatal. A biomechanical analysis published in 2005 reported that \\"forceful shaking can severely injure or kill an infant, this is because the cervical spine would be severely injured and not because subdural hematomas would be caused by high head rotational accelerations... an infant head subjected to the levels of rotational velocity and acceleration called for in the SBS literature, would experience forces on the infant neck far exceeding the limits for structural failure of the cervical spine. Furthermore, shaking cervical spine injury can occur at much lower levels of head velocity and acceleration than those reported for SBS.\\" Other authors were critical of the mathematical analysis by Bandak, citing concerns about the calculations the author used concluding \\"In light of the numerical errors in Bandak‚Äôs neck force estimations, we question the resolute tenor of Bandak‚Äôs conclusions that neck injuries would occur in all shaking events.\\" Other authors critical of the model proposed by Bandak concluding \\"the mechanical analogue proposed in the paper may not be entirely appropriate when used to model the motion of the head and neck of infants when a baby is shaken.\\" Bandak responded to the criticism in a letter to the editor published in Forensic Science International in February 2006. which refers to Diagnosis Diagnosis can be difficult as symptoms may be nonspecific. A CT scan of the head is typically recommended if a concern is present. While retinal bleeding is common, it can also occur in other conditions. It is unclear how useful subdural haematoma, retinal hemorrhages, and encephalopathy are alone at making the diagnosis.

AHT may be misdiagnosed, underdiagnosed, and overdiagnosed,Report questioning shaken baby syndrome seriously unbalanced http://www.aappublications.org/content/36/5/1.2 and caregivers may lie or be unaware of the mechanism of injury. Commonly, there are no externally visible signs of the condition. Examination by an experienced ophthalmologist is often critical in diagnosing shaken baby syndrome, as particular forms of ocular bleeding are quite characteristic. Magnetic resonance imaging may also depict retinal hemorrhaging; this may occasionally be useful if an ophthalmologist examination is delayed or unavailable. Conditions that are often excluded by clinicians include hydrocephalus, sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS), seizure disorders, and infectious or congenital diseases like meningitis and metabolic disorders. CT scanning and magnetic resonance imaging are used to diagnose the condition. Conditions that may accompany AHT include bone fractures, injury to the cervical spine (in the neck), retinal bleeding, cerebral bleed or atrophy, hydrocephalus, and papilledema (swelling of the optic disc). The terms non- accidental head injury or inflicted traumatic brain injury have been suggested instead of Abusive head trauma or \\"SBS\\". = Classification = The term abusive head trauma is preferred as it better represents the broader potential causes. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention identifies SBS as \\"an injury to the skull or intracranial contents of an infant or young child (< 5 years of age) due to inflicted blunt impact and/or violent shaking\\". In 2009, the American Academy of Pediatrics recommended the use of the term abusive head trauma to replace SBS, in part to differentiate injuries arising solely from shaking and injuries arising from shaking as well as trauma to the head.Abusive Head Trauma: A New Name for Shaken Baby Syndrome SBS was previously believed to present with constellation of findings (often referred to as a \\"triad\\"): subdural hematoma; retinal bleeding; and brain swelling or encephalopathy ‚Äì which has controversially been used to infer child abuse caused by violent shaking or traumatic shaking. The diagnostic accuracy of the triad, linked to episodes of traumatic shaking is controversial with a 2016 systematic review finding limited scientific evidence associating the triad to episodes of traumatic shaking, and insufficient evidence for using the triad to identify such episodes. The connection is controversial in part following cases where parents of children exhibiting the triad have, in addition to losing custody, been jailed or sentenced to death. The Crown Prosecution Service for England and Wales recommended in 2011 that the term shaken baby syndrome be avoided and the term non accidental head injury (NAHI) be used instead.Non Accidental Head Injury Cases (NAHI, formerly referred to as Shaken Baby Syndrome Prosecution Approach =Differential diagnosis= Vitamin C deficiency Some authors have suggested that certain cases of suspected shaken baby syndrome may result from vitamin C deficiency. This contested hypothesis is based upon a speculated marginal, near scorbutic condition or lack of essential nutrient(s) repletion and a potential elevated histamine level. However, symptoms consistent with increased histamine levels, such as low blood pressure and allergic symptoms, are not commonly associated with scurvy as clinically significant vitamin C deficiency. A literature review of this hypothesis in the journal Pediatrics International concluded the following: \\"From the available information in the literature, concluded that there was no convincing evidence to conclude that vitamin C deficiency can be considered to be a cause of shaken baby syndrome.\\" The proponents of such hypotheses often question the adequacy of nutrient tissue levels, especially vitamin C, for those children currently or recently ill, bacterial infections, those with higher individual requirements, those suffering from environmental challenges (e.g. allergies), and perhaps transient vaccination-related stresses. At the time of this writing, infantile scurvy in the United States is practically nonexistent. No cases of scurvy mimicking SBS or sudden infant death syndrome have been reported, and scurvy typically occurs later in infancy, rarely causes death or intracranial bleeding, and is accompanied by other changes of the bones and skin and invariably an unusually deficient dietary history. In one study vaccination was shown not associated with retinal hemorrhages. Gestational problems Gestational problems affecting both mother and fetus, the birthing process, prematurity and nutritional deficits can accelerate skeletal and hemorrhagic pathologies that can also mimic SBS, even before birth. Prevention Interventions by neonatal nurses including giving parents information about abusive head trauma, normal infant crying and reasons for crying, teaching how to calm an infant, and how to cope if the infant was inconsolable may reduce rates of AHT. Treatment Treatment involves monitoring intracranial pressure (the pressure within the skull), draining fluid from the cerebral ventricles, and, if an intracranial hematoma is present, draining the blood collection. Prognosis Prognosis depends on severity and can range from total recovery to severe disability to death when the injury is severe. One third of these patients die, one third survives with a major neurological condition, and only one third survives in good condition. The most frequent neurological impairments are learning disabilities, seizure disorders, speech disabilities, hydrocephalus, cerebral palsy, and visual disorders. Epidemiology Small children are at particularly high risk for the abuse that causes SBS given the large difference in size between the small child and an adult. SBS usually occurs in children under the age of two but may occur in those up to age five. History In 1971, Norman Guthkelch proposed that whiplash injury caused subdural bleeding in infants by tearing the veins in the subdural space.Integrity in Science: The Case of Dr Norman Guthkelch, ‚ÄòShaken Baby Syndrome‚Äô and Miscarriages of Justice By Dr Lynne Wrennall The term \\"whiplash shaken infant syndrome\\" was introduced by Dr. John Caffey, a pediatric radiologist, in 1973, describing a set of symptoms found with little or no external evidence of head trauma, including retinal bleeds and intracranial bleeds with subdural or subarachnoid bleeding or both. Development of computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging techniques in the 1970s and 1980s advanced the ability to diagnose the syndrome. Legal issues The President's Council of Advisers on Science and Technology (PCAST) noted in its September 2016 report that there are concerns regarding the scientific validity of forensic evidence of abusive head trauma that \\"require urgent attention\\".Forensic Science in Criminal Courts: Ensuring Scientific Validity of Feature-Comparison Methods (p. 23) Similarly, the Maguire model, suggested in 2011 as a potential statistical model for determining the probability that a child's trauma was caused by abuse, has been questioned.Cuellar M. Causal reasoning and data analysis: Problems with the abusive head trauma diagnosis. Law, Probability and Risk, 2017; 16(4): 223‚Äì239. doi:10.1093/lpr/mgx011 A proposed clinical prediction rule with high sensitivity and low specificity, to rule out Abusive Head Trauma, has been published.Pfeiffer H, et al. External Validation of the PediBIRN Clinical Prediction Rule of Abusive Head Trauma. Pediatrics, 2018; 141(5): e20173674. doi:10.1542/peds.2017-3674 In July 2005, the Court of Appeals in the United Kingdom heard four appeals of SBS convictions: one case was dropped, the sentence was reduced for one, and two convictions were upheld. The court found that the classic triad of retinal bleeding, subdural hematoma, and acute encephalopathy are not 100% diagnostic of SBS and that clinical history is also important. In the Court's ruling, they upheld the clinical concept of SBS but dismissed one case and reduced another from murder to manslaughter. In their words: \\"Whilst a strong pointer to NAHI [non-accidental head injury] on its own we do not think it possible to find that it must automatically and necessarily lead to a diagnosis of NAHI. All the circumstances, including the clinical picture, must be taken into account.\\" The court invalidated the \\"unified hypothesis\\", proposed by British physician J. F. Geddes and colleagues, as an alternative mechanism for the subdural and retinal bleeding found in suspected cases of SBS. The unified hypothesis proposed that the bleeding was not caused by shearing of subdural and retinal veins but rather by cerebral hypoxia, increased intracranial pressure, and increased pressure in the brain's blood vessels. The court reported that \\"the unified hypothesis [could] no longer be regarded as a credible or alternative cause of the triad of injuries\\": subdural haemorrhage, retinal bleeding and encephalopathy due to hypoxemia (low blood oxygen) found in suspected SBS. On January 31, 2008, the Wisconsin Court of Appeals granted Audrey A. Edmunds a new trial based on \\"competing credible medical opinions in determining whether there is a reasonable doubt as to Edmunds's guilt.\\" Specifically, the appeals court found that \\"Edmunds presented evidence that was not discovered until after her conviction, in the form of expert medical testimony, that a significant and legitimate debate in the medical community has developed in the past ten years over whether infants can be fatally injured through shaking alone, whether an infant may suffer head trauma and yet experience a significant lucid interval prior to death, and whether other causes may mimic the symptoms traditionally viewed as indicating shaken baby or shaken impact syndrome.\\"Keith A. Findley Co‚ÄêDirector, Wisconsin Innocence Project Clinical Professor, University of Wisconsin Law School Litigating Postconviction Challenges to Shaken Baby Syndrome Convictions In 2012, A. Norman Guthkelch, the neurosurgeon often credited with \\"discovering\\" the diagnosis of SBS, published an article \\"after 40 years of consideration,\\" which is harshly critical of shaken baby prosecutions based solely on the triad of injuries. Again, in 2012, Dr. Guthkelch stated in an interview, \\"I think we need to go back to the drawing board and make a more thorough assessment of these fatal cases, and I am going to bet . . . that we are going to find in every - or at least the large majority of cases, the child had another severe illness of some sort which was missed until too late.\\" Furthermore, in 2015, Dr. Guthkelch went so far as to say, \\"I was against defining this thing as a syndrome in the first instance. To go on and say every time you see it, it's a crime...It became an easy way to go into jail.\\" On the other hand, Teri Covington, who runs the National Center for Child Death Review Policy and Practice, worries that such caution has led to a growing number of cases of child abuse in which the abuser is not punished. In March 2016, Waney Squier, a paediatric neuropathologist who has served as an expert witness in many shaken baby trials, was struck off the medical register for misconduct. Shortly after her conviction, Dr. Squier was given the \\"champion of justice\\" award by the International Innocence Network for her efforts to free those wrongfully convicted of shaken baby syndrome.Oxford doctor Waney Squire vows to fight suspension over 'shaken baby' trial evidence Squier denied the allegations and appealed the decision to strike her off the medical register. As her case was heard by the High Court of England and Wales in October 2016, an open letter to the British Medical Journal questioning the decision to strike off Dr. Squier, was signed by 350 doctors, scientists, and attorneys. On 3 November 2016, the court published a judgment which concluded that \\"the determination of the MPT is in many significant respects flawed\\". The judge found that she had committed serious professional misconduct but was not dishonest. She was reinstated to the medical register but is not allowed to give expert evidence in court for three years. The Louise Woodward case relied on the \\"shaken baby syndrome\\".

At the 2011 census, its population was 144,664. Anzali is one of the most important cities in Iran in terms of tourism, economics, and athletics.http://ilna.ir/news/news?id=9047 The city was home to the first and biggest port on the southern shores of the Caspian Sea. Bandar-e Anzali consists of an island called Mianposhteh and the surrounding lands. Tourist attractions include a clock tower called Manareh, the long harbour promenade, and the water-logged delta and beach along the Sefid Rud.  History  Anzali is an old city in ancient Iran, they are related to Kadusin, owing to their pleasant relationship with Cyprus and their cooperation in battles, they changed their name to Anzan (Anshan-e Pars) \\"The Anshans of Persia\\", in which the Greeks called Anzaluy. This word in Middle Persian means Anzalag and the variant Persian form of it is Anzalazh. Anzali Gulf was a safe harbour for trade ships and fishing boats. It was renamed to Pahlavi in 1935. In 1919, with the collapse of General Anton Denikin's White Russian army, eighteen of his ships sought refuge in Anzali. On 18 May 1920, a Soviet flotilla of thirteen ships launched a surprise attack on Anzali, capturing the British garrison and the eighteen White Russian ships. This allowed for the establishment of the short-lived Persian Socialist Republic and the Persian Communist Party. Soviet authorities denied responsibility for the attack, blaming the local Russian naval commander for attacking under his own authority.A Peace to End All Peace, David Fromkin, 1989, pp.458-459. Its wonderful lagoon, Customs and City Hall edifice (Shahrdari), Mian Poshte Palace and Motamedi Edifice, are its tourist attractions. Until 1980, when it was moved to Noshahr, Anzali was the site of the Caspian University of Naval Science. The structure Of Naser-al-din Shah Place which was built by Moayer- ol-mamalekk and its famous Sangi Bath was destroyed by people and natural factors. A wonder of Sangi Bath was the system of heating and durability water in its basins. Some groups think that Motamedi edifice had been changed; it is now its police office. This Ghajar Structure built in two floors with the help of Mirza Abd-ol-Vahab. Geography Tovoos Tower, the tallest tower in Bandar-e Anzali The Anzali Lagoon divides the Anzali Port in two parts. The city is connected by two bridges to the Beheshti Island. There is a caviar processing factory in Bandar-e Anzali, some old ruins from 19th century and the popular Shanbeh Bazaar. Tourbebar is a village about 40 kilometers from Bandar-e Anzali, near the Anzali Lagoon. Climate Bandar-e Anzali has a humid subtropical climate (K√∂ppen climate classification Cfa). It has the most humid climate of any city in Iran, having a climate somewhat similar in its heavy autumn and early winter rainfall, persistent high humidity and low sunshine to the Sea of Japan coast of Japan, though it receives much less summer rainfall than that region. The warm and humid weather has allowed this region to grow crops such as rice and tea that require very large amounts of moisture, especially with the extra water draining from the Elburz Mountains. Caviar Bandar-e Anzali is a center of caviar production. The preparation and marketing of which is a state monopoly, handled through the Iranian Fishing Company under the control of the Finance Ministry. The public is not admitted to the immense refrigerated hangars where tons of sturgeons, some as large as 3 meters long and weighing 100 kilograms, are stored after the removal of the caviar, usually equivalent to about one tenth of their weight. Sports The most popular sport in Anzali is football, and the city is known as a football hub in Iran. Malavan, one of the most famous teams in Iran, is the main team of the city, and they currently play in the second tier Azadegan League. Current and former national team player such as Sirous Ghayeghran, Saeid Ezatolahi, Mohammad Mayeli Kohan, Jalal Hosseini, Maziar Zare, Mohammad Gholami, Jalal Rafkhaei, and Sosha Makani have come from Anzali. People In the past, citizens of Anzali were mostly involved in the fish trade. Rice farming and agriculture are the other traditional jobs in Anzali, and are practiced in the villages surrounding the city.

Berliner was the son of Emile Berliner, who had patented numerous inventions relating to sound and acoustics, and pioneer of helicopter development with the experimental Berliner Helicopter. The younger Berliner founded ERCO to produce tools for the manufacture of metal aircraft and propellers. He founded the company in a shed at 2014 5th street NW Washington D.C. Berliner met Fred Weick, an aeronautical engineer, who worked with National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics in cowlings and propellers on a 1926 while developing the propellers for the USS Akron. Weick also worked on an experimental aircraft that incorporated the up-to-date safety features. In 1935, the company moved to 6100 Sligo Blvd. In 1936, Weick left NACA to work for ERCO on his \\"safety airplane\\". In 1937, Berliner purchased 50 acres of land in Riverdale, Maryland near the College Park Airport and built the large ERCO factory and airstrip. One of ERCO's most significant achievements was the development of the Ercoupe aircraft. The first experimental model of the Ercoupe was test-flown at College Park airport in 1937. It had a single tail (unlike the eventual production Ercoupes, with their characteristic twin tails) and was known as the \\"Jeep\\". In late 1938, ERCO searched unsuccessfully for a suitable engine for its new airplane. ERCO hired Harold Morehouse, former engineer in charge of small engine design at Continental Motors, to design a new engine. He came up with the inverted, in-line I-L 116, which provided good pilot visibility and enhanced aircraft streamlining. ERCO installed the I-L 116 in the prototype Ercoupe Model 310 in 1939. The engine performed well, but ERCO discontinued it when Continental introduced the A-65 engine in 1940, which generated comparable horsepower at half the cost. Construction of the production prototype was completed in 1939, and certification by the CAA was completed in 1940. The first Ercoupe, serial No. 1, was owned by George Brinckerhoff, the operator of the College Park Airport, and flown there. It now is at the National Air and Space Museum. During World War II, the ERCO factory made several products under contract with the U.S. government, including gun turrets. ERCO earned an \\"E\\" award for excellence in meeting manufacturing goals in its war contracts. In 1947, Berliner decided to leave the aviation industry and sold the drawings, tools, parts, materials and distribution rights for the Ercoupe to Sanders Aviation, although the small aircraft market had fallen into decline. In all, ERCO and Sanders Aviation sold just over 5,000 Ercoupes. In 1948, ERCO started producing aircraft simulators, becoming its main line of business. In November 1954, ERCO became part of ACF.

Boeing was hiring, the economy was booming, and while there had been no successful regional planning, the city had not yet grown quite large enough. The Boeing airplane company grew out of the fortune of William \\"Bill\\" Boeing's boat company and his fascination with airplanes and flying. In 1917, before American entry into World War I, Boeing employed only 28 people, but when the war orders started coming in, Boeing grew to \\"an enterprising firm with the one customer airplane builders had in those days, the federal government. Employing about four thousand people, with sales just under ten million dollars a year, it was a good if unspectacular business for Seattle.\\" The company struggled through the period between the wars, and \\"began to build dressers, counters and furniture for a corset company and a confectioner's shop, as well as flat-bottomed boats called sea sleds.\\"The Boeing Company, Boeing: History ‚Äì Beginnings ‚Äì Growing Pains, originally on the official Boeing site, archived on the Internet Archive 2 February 2003, accessed 27 July 2008. However, when World War II started, the government suddenly desired tens of thousands of planes a year, and Boeing was positioned to provide them. Working under fixed-fee contracts, Boeing churned out airplanes and became by far the largest employer in Seattle. Boeing employees protest meeting in City Hall Park, 1943. Signs say \\"Production always above expectation\\". However, Boeing spawned few local spin-off industries; only 5% of the subcontracted work was in the Puget Sound. Boeing was, by intention, a place where engineers designed the planes and line workers assembled parts that were imported from all over the world. Ostensibly, this would reduce the dependency of Seattle's economy on the fortunes of the airline business. The problem was that Seattle was still dependent on the airline business, without enjoying any of the spin- off industries that might have diversified the economy. When the war ended, \\"the military canceled its bomber orders; Boeing factories shut down and 70,000 people lost their jobs,\\" and initially it appeared that Seattle had little to show for the wartime Boeing boom. While the war was on, almost all production went either towards Boeing factories or Boeing planes. After the war, the crash ensured that no one would have much money for new local development. This period of stagnation soon ended with the rise of the jet airplane and Boeing's reincarnation as the world's leading producer of commercial passenger planes. With the Boeing 707-120, Seattle became Boeing's company town; \\"in 1947 Boeing employed about one out of every five of King County's manufacturing workers, in 1957 about every other one.\\" As Boeing boomed, so did Seattle. From 1940 to 1950, the population increased 99,289 or 27% from 368,302 to 467,591. From 1950 to 1960, the population increased 89,496 or 20% to 557,087. All of those people had to live somewhere, and the Fifties saw a huge housing boom. Population density all over Seattle exploded as people filled the boundaries of settlement in the city and began to move north. Most of the development was in single-family houses, since land was plentiful. Constructing the Alaskan Way Viaduct, 1952 At the same time, the freeways were being built to compensate for all this new growth. The community of Mercer Island, the \\"Eastside\\" (east of Lake Washington) communities of Bryn Mawr, Newport, Bellevue, Clyde Hill, Hunts Point, Medina, Juanita, and the northern suburbs of Kenmore, Lake Forest Park, and Lake Hills all came into being during the Boeing boom. Interstate 5 (I-5) cut the city in half on a north‚Äìsouth axis, while I-90 crossed east‚Äìwest, connecting with Mercer Island via the floating Lacey V. Murrow Memorial Bridge. SR 520 skirted the north end of Montlake just south of the Montlake Cut, and paralleled I-90 with its own floating bridge. I-5 neatly cut off Downtown Seattle from Capitol Hill, First Hill, and even from part of the historic downtown, including the Tony Sorrento Hotel, which was left stranded on the \\"wrong\\" side of the freeway. I-90 was perhaps less disruptive (unless, of course, you were living in its path), since it is partly routed through a tunnel and skirts a more-or-less unbuildable edge of Beacon Hill, avoiding slicing the city into north and south halves. Freeway Park was eventually built over I-5 in 1976, restoring something of a link between Downtown and First Hill, but was not heavily enough used to provide much mitigation. The R.H. Thompson Expressway, planned to connect SR 520 with I-90 and SR 167 via the Central District, and the Bay Freeway, connecting I-5 with the Seattle Center via Mercer Street, were canceled by citizen referendums as part of nationwide freeway revolts. With all this postwar growth came growing pollution of the lakes and rivers that provided much of the beauty that had been Seattle's appeal to its recent immigrants. Also, the sprawl constantly demanded more roads, since the ones already built had terrible traffic. (Naturally, new roads simply led to new development and were soon as snarled as those they were intended to relieve.) A group of Seattle natives, anxious to preserve the city in which they grew up, came together to institute the Metropolitan Problems Committee, or METRO, intended to manage and plan the metropolitan area. The driving force behind this movement was Jim Ellis, who headed the committee and repeatedly brought the planning issue before the voters and city governments. The logic was that a regional transit system would require a regional political body; the same held for regional sewage and pollution control or regional growth planning. The original, comprehensive METRO regional plan was defeated in a vote by suburbanites who seemed to view the problem not as one of pollution, transit, sprawl, or lack of planning: in what some Seattleites referred to as the \\"Pave the Lake\\" strategy, they just wanted more bridges across Lake Washington. METRO came back, scaled down to a sewage treatment and transport organization, and prevailed with an overwhelming majority in Seattle and a decent showing in the suburbs. METRO, despite repeated attempts by Jim Ellis, never did manage to get authority for planning, and to this day there is no single body responsible for planning the Seattle metropolitan area and its transportation systems. (METRO was eventually merged into the King County government.) Seattle and King County have, at times, seemed better at coming up with money for stadiums and other large public works than for broader projects. During this period, Seattle's downtown was in decline (as were many other downtowns across the nation, for much the same reason): people shopped in the suburbs, not in the city. The market for goods in the city's center was drying up. Seattle's solution was to host the Century 21 Exposition, the 1962 World's Fair. The area directly north of downtown was slumping very badly‚Äîsome of it to the point of being known as the \\"Warren Avenue slum\\"Florence K. Lentz and Mimi Sheridan, Queen Anne Historic Context Statement , prepared for the Seattle Department of Neighborhoods, Historic Preservation Program and the Queen Anne Historical Society, October 2005, p. 22. Accessed online 24 July 2008.‚Äîand the city owned a lot of property almost adjacent to that \\"slum\\". The fair, given a futuristic science theme, was designed to leave behind a civic center, now known as Seattle Center, containing arts buildings, a food court, museums, and the like and serving also as a fairground. The United States Science Pavilion (now the Pacific Science Center) was one of the central attractions. Boeing performed one of its few altruistic public actions: they \\"created and installed in the United States Science Pavilion a space age Spacearium, a permanent addition to the center and one of the most attractive features of the fair.\\" Monorail, 1961. In conjunction with the fair, a demonstration monorail line was constructed, running from the center of downtown to the fair, a distance of 0.9 miles; it was constructed at no cost to the city and was paid for out of ticket sales, and then turned over to the city for $600,000. (See Seattle Center Monorail). It is currently the only monorail in the United States to turn a profit. It is now almost exclusively a tourist attraction, as the distance covered is too small to be of much practical use unless you are living in a hotel downtown and visiting the Seattle Center. The World's Fair also granted Seattle the landmark Space Needle, also a continuing tourist attraction. Seattle also acquired an Opera House, a Coliseum, and a refurbished Arena (all of which have since been replaced or significantly remodeled), and a great location for future carnivals and fairs. Today, Seattle Center is host to the Bite of Seattle, Bumbershoot, a music and art festival that draws crowds in the hundreds of thousands every Labor Day Weekend, Northwest Folklife Festival on Memorial Day Weekend, a comparably large folk music and folk culture festival, which somehow manages to stay in the black despite being free to all comers, and PrideFest, a finali of the much larger event Seattle Gay Pride Parade like many other cities every year in late June in honor of the 1969 Stonewall Riots proudly flying the pride flag atop the Space Needle for the first time in 2010. The Pacific Science Center continues to draw crowds, along with a small amusement park that operates all summer ‚Äì *Needs updating, amusement park removed years ago as part of the Experience Music Project (now Mo-Pop, Musium of Pop Culture) construction on the site. The World's Fair arguably reenergized the downtown of Seattle, and was generally a smashing success, even finishing with a profit. After the war, the University of Washington also took a step forward, finally fulfilling the promise of its name. Charles Odegaard, as president of the University, used his office to press for the creation of community colleges and other four-year colleges in Washington, so that the University of Washington could concentrate on research. By the time Odegaard retired, the UW was second only to MIT in the size of its federal grants, and the number of students attending had swelled. Because the University of Washington campus is open, its impact on the University District as well as the rest of the city was quite significant; \\"In remaining a largely commuter school, the university has diminished its ability to withdraw as a community in itself and has maintained thereby its ability to the larger and more amorphous community.\\" Counterculture Members of the Love Family performing at Pike Place Market 65th anniversary celebration, 1972. Starting in the late 1950s, Seattle was one of the centers of the emergence of the American counterculture and culture of protest. Before grunge there were beats, fringies (a local Seattle term), hippies, and batcavers. Opened in 1967, one counterculture haven in Seattle was the Last Exit on Brooklyn coffeehouse located near the University of Washington. At the University itself, Parrington Lawn became known as \\"Hippie Hill\\", due in part to UW President Charles Odegaard's \\"outstandingly tolerant attitude toward the hippie element on and near his jurisdiction's campus, as well as his ongoing refusal to allow Seattle city police onto UW property.\\" The Seattle counterculture played a role in early urban environmentalism. In the early 1970s, the Northwest Tilth Association promoted alternative modes of production and consumption of food, laying the foundation for an organic food economy in the Pacific Northwest region. Political emergence of non-white minorities Despite Seattle being one of the \\"whitest\\" major cities in the United States, it has had an African-American mayor (Norm Rice), at least four African-American city council members, and at least half a dozen Asian- American city council members including Wing Luke, the first Asian American elected to public office in Washington (in 1962). It has also been the political base for figures such as former King County Executives Gary Locke‚Äîwho went on to be the first Chinese-American governor of a U.S. state‚Äîand Ron Sims, an African American who went on to become the Deputy Secretary of the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development. After World War II, many African-Americans moved into the Central District. This neighborhood began to gentrify in the 1990s and today, the city's African American population is more focused on the South End of the city. Boeing bust: 1970‚Äì1985 Due to changing external demand and the cancellation of the SST program, \\"the Boeing workforce was cut from 80,400 to 37,200 between early 1970 and October 1971\\".The Boeing Company, Boeing: History ‚Äì New Markets, originally on the official Boeing site, archived on the Internet Archive 2 February 2003, accessed 27 July 2008. After 1973, Seattle was in good company for its recession, since the rest of the country was also experiencing the energy crisis. However, Seattle was hit harder than most cities due to its over-reliance on Boeing as an employer, and had the worst post-Depression unemployment for any major US city, nearly 12%. As with most periods of downturn, there was not much private investment or construction. However, despite the crushing unemployment and the infamous billboard saying \\"Will the last person leaving Seattle ‚Äì Turn out the lights,\\" the outflux of people was \\"never more than 15% of those laid off,\\" and was promptly countered by new arrivals taking advantage of the now-underpriced housing stock. Quite likely, Seattle evaded the fate of Detroit through being a port city with a large number of highly educated, skilled workers. Seattle industry did slightly better than the national average during the rest of the 1970s; nonetheless the boom decades of the 1950s and 1960s had been brought to a decisive end. Pioneer Square. The Pike Place Market, arguably Seattle's most significant tourist attraction, gained its modern form in the aftermath of the Boeing crash. The market had been founded in 1907 with a great deal of early success, but, like most public markets in America, had suffered a decline as corporations took over food distribution. The deportation of the Japanese from Seattle during World War II hit the market particularly hard, since 80% of its \\"wet stall\\" vendors had been ethnically Japanese. The city council wanted to make a \\"Pike Place Plaza\\" by demolishing the mostly derelict market and replacing it with \\"a new hotel, a 32-story apartment building, four 28-story office buildings, a hockey arena, and a 4,000-car parking garage.\\"Pike Place Market ‚Äì History , Pike Place Market. Page no longer online 27 July 2008. A \\"Keep the Market\\" initiative, led by architect Victor Steinbrueck, was passed in 1971, pushing for adaptive reuse. A promotional committee was created, historical district status attained, and vendors were convinced to move in and sell wares. The project was wildly successful, and today the Pike Place Market pulls nine million visitors each year. A similar story occurred with Pioneer Square. An old neighborhood, largely built after the Great Seattle Fire, it had fallen into derelict status after the war. However, with a reenergized downtown, businesses started to look for buildings that could be acquired cheaply. When offices moved into renovated buildings, suddenly there was a market for facilities to service them, leading to a \\"flood of other restaurants, galleries, boutiques.\\" Seattle was definitely recovering from the blow dealt by the Boeing recession, refilling areas that had threatened to become slums. Silicon Forest: 1985‚Äìpresent Downtown Seattle, 2009 Bill Gates and Paul Allen, founders of Microsoft Corporation, attended the Lakeside School, a private middle and high school in Haller Lake, at the northern Seattle city limits. This turned out to have rather dramatic consequences for the entire Seattle area. Microsoft's first product, Microsoft BASIC, came out in 1976. The company was incorporated in New Mexico the same year. By 1978 sales exceeded one million dollars a year. In 1979, Microsoft moved its offices back to Redmond from Albuquerque, New Mexico‚Äîthey had gone to New Mexico to be near a client who no longer dominated their business, Gates and Allen wanted to go back where they were from, and it was easier to entice quality programmers to the Seattle area than the deserts of New Mexico. By 1985, sales were over $140 million, by 1990, $1.18 billion, and by 1995, Microsoft was the world's most profitable corporation, Allen and Gates were billionaires, and literally thousands of their past and present employees were millionaires. Microsoft had grown from a two-man operation to a company with 11,000 employees in 1992 and 48,030 (about half of them in the Seattle area) in 2001. Microsoft spawned a host of other companies in the Seattle area: millionaire employees often left to found their own companies, and Allen, after his own departure from Microsoft, became a major investor in new companies. Seattle-area companies that owe their origins at least indirectly to Microsoft include RealNetworks, Attachmate, InfoSpace, and a host of others. Quite unlike Boeing, Microsoft has served as a catalyst for the creation of a whole realm of industry. Microsoft has also taken a much more active hand than Boeing in public works in the area, donating software to many schools (including the University of Washington). During this era, Seattle has also experienced quite good growth in the biotechnology and coffee sectors, and Seattle-based Nordstrom became a national brand. Paul Allen, whose fortune was made through Microsoft though he has long since ceased to be an active participant in the company, has been a major force in Seattle politics. He attempted a voter initiative to build the Seattle Commons, a huge park in South Lake Union and the Cascade District, and even offered to put up his own money to endow a security force for the park, but it was defeated at the polls. (Allen is now the leader of the movement to redevelop this same area as a biotech center.) He did get a football stadium for the Seattle Seahawks through a successful statewide ballot initiative, and founded the Experience Music Project (originally intended as a Jimi Hendrix museum) on the grounds of Seattle Center. One other piece of urban design in this era is the Washington State Convention and Trade Center, completed in 1988 and expanded in 2003, which bridges the freeway and adjoins Freeway Park, connecting First Hill to downtown. Arguably, the convention center has helped fuel further downtown growth and has (at least to some extent) reconnected both sides of the freeway. Paralleling the Microsoft and Internet boom, Downtown Seattle underwent a revival; at the height of the boom, downtown office space was described as \\"Number four or five on the national hit parade [of real estate prices], and climbing.\\"Michael Allmon, \\"Seattle Real Estate is Climbing the Charts\\", Seattle Daily Journal of Commerce, 12 March 1998. Accessed 27 July 2008. After an increase in vacancy to double-digit levels in the Internet Bust, occupancy began to return. The return of the downtown retail district appears to be a more lasting phenomenon, although at the expense of having a retail district dominated by national chain stores, many of them gathered in mall complexes. The growth of the tech industry such as Amazon and its expansion to the downtown area also resulted in a record level construction boom following the Great Recession, with a total of 68 major projects underway from Sodo to South Lake Union at the end of 2016, the most since 2005. Much of the development was residential which comprise up to 2/3 of all projects, most of which were centered at South Lake Union. As a result, twice as many apartments in Seattle opened in 2017 than any other year in the city's history. The pace of development is expected to increase slightly until 2019. N30 Police using pepper spray against WTO protestors. Seattle's bid for the world stage by hosting the World Trade Organization Ministerial Conference of 1999 did not play out as planned. Instead, the city became the site of the first great street confrontation between the anti-globalization movement and the World Trade Organization on 30 November 1999. While many of those in the streets, and most of those in the suites, were from out of town or even out of country, much of the groundwork of Seattle hosting both the event and the protests against it can be attributed to local forces. Music Singer, songwriter, and guitarist Shane Tutmarc carries on a family musical tradition: his great-grandfather Paul Tutmarc, also from Seattle, has been credited as the inventor of the electric bass. Seattle has long had a rich musical heritage, as many of rock's top names since the '60s have hailed from the area. In the mid-20th century the thriving jazz scene in the city's Skid Road and Central Districts launched the careers of such luminaries as Ray Charles and Quincy Jones. Both Jones and, later, Jimi Hendrix attended Garfield High School, and in the '60s, such garage rock/proto punk bands as the Sonics and the Wailers emerged, and in the '70s, Heart. The '80s saw such Seattle heavy metal acts as Queensr√øche and Metal Church gain popularity, while Seattle native Duff McKagan went on to massive success with Guns N' Roses after relocating to Los Angeles. But it was perhaps the early '90s grunge movement for which Seattle is best known from a musical perspective. During this time such acts as Mother Love Bone, Nirvana, Pearl Jam, Soundgarden, Temple of the Dog, Alice in Chains, and Mudhoney scored massive worldwide hits, and turned the musical tide from glam metal to a style that borrowed equally from garage rockers (the Sonics), punk (the Stooges), and '70s heavy metal (Black Sabbath). Environmental sustainability In 1971, Weldon Robison along with Ron Ralph established a community based non-profit glass recycling effort in the Eastlake Community of Seattle. It was simply called \\"The Glass Barrel\\" and was registered and incorporated as a non-profit enterprise with the City of Seattle. Three sites were established on Fairview Ave East and one above the houseboats on Portage Bay. Glass was separated in three colors and deposited in three separate oil drums. Recycling glass in 1990, before curbside recycling collections began. Seattle was voted the United States' most \\"green\\" city by the NRDC (Natural Resources Defense Council), which gave the following reasons for the designation (among others):Smarter Cities and Seattle, WA  Smarter Cities , NRDC.

The charter of the Agreement is to reduce the environmental impact of U.S. cities on the environment and meet the Kyoto environmental protocols, sidestepping the Bush administration's refusal to sign on. # Over 90% of the city's electric demand is fed by hydroelectric power. # Comprehensive recycling and sustainable resource use practices. # The most successful car- and van-pool program in the country. # Expansion of the city's light rail system. The city's populace is also environmentally conscious, stemming from the natural beauty and landscape surrounding the area. Land use policies and natural geography have led to an increase in property value as the aforementioned boom in population with the arrival of Microsoft, new business for Boeing, and the foundation of Starbucks as a global corporation, has put a strain on availability of single family home property.

The arrival of Greeks and Sephardic Jews broadened the city's ethnic mix. Many of Seattle's neighborhoods got their start around this time.

The last great manhunt of the Wild West was the search for Harry Tracy in Seattle in 1902. In 1908, the Great White Fleet visited Seattle and the US West Coast, \\"to demonstrate to the world America's naval prowess.https://www.loc.gov/rr/news/topics/greatfleet.html Construction on the Smith Tower was completed in 1914. It was the tallest building west of the Mississippi River from its completion in 1914 until the Space Needle overtook it in 1962. It remained the tallest office building west of the Mississippi River until the Humble Building (now Exxon Building) was built in 1963. Following the vision of city engineer R.H. Thomson, who had already played a key role in the development of municipal utilities, a massive effort was made to level the extreme hills that rose south and north of the bustling city. From 1900 to 1914 the Denny Regrade to the north and the Jackson Regrade to the south leveled more than of Denny Hill and parts of First and Beacon Hills. The Denny Regrade continued in spurts until 1930. Dirt from the Jackson Regrade filled in the swampy tidelands that are now occupied by the SoDo neighborhood as well as Safeco Field and Qwest Field. A seawall containing dirt from the Denny Regrade created the current waterfront. More dirt from the Denny Regrade went to build the industrial Harbor Island at the mouth of the Duwamish River, south of Downtown. The Denny Regrade wasn't the only radical reshaping of Seattle's topography in this period. The 1911‚Äì1917 construction of the Lake Washington Ship Canal included two major \\"cuts\\" (the Montlake Cut and the Fremont Cut, four bascule bridges, and the Government Locks (now Hiram M. Chittenden Locks). The level of Lake Washington dropped; the Black River, which formerly ran out of the south end of the lake, dried up completely, and Seward Island became the Seward Peninsula, now the site of Seward Park. After the obvious geographical expansion from downtown, \\"other neighborhoods‚Ä¶ [came]‚Ä¶ into existence‚Ä¶ [as]‚Ä¶ the result of streetcar lines moving north and east from downtown and providing opportunities for settling that were obviously attractive to all but the poorest.\\" Several lines, running to most of central Seattle's modern neighborhoods, created the communities of Capitol Hill, Queen Anne, Madrona, Madison Park, and Leschi. All of the expansion was happening without zoning, leading to \\"different land uses and economic classes everywhere [being] mixed.\\" Seattle also grew by annexation in this period, annexing areas including the previously separately incorporated Columbia City, Ballard, South Park, and West Seattle in 1907 and Georgetown in 1910. At the same time as the city was expanding dramatically, the city planners began to put in parks. \\"Four million dollars worth of bonds were sold between 1905 and 1912 to develop the parks and build the boulevards designed by the Olmsteds to connect them.\\" Almost all of Seattle's large parks were constructed during this period: Woodland Park (which includes the Woodland Park Zoo), Volunteer Park, Green Lake, Washington Park (now the site of the University of Washington Arboretum), Ravenna Park, Leschi Park, Seward Park. The Olmsted plan for boulevards was carried out nearly in full. The form of the plan was \\"a winding parkway of about which would link most of the existing and planned parks and greenbelts within the city limits.\\" Then, as now, no main park or particular area of Seattle that stood out above the rest. Much of the ambiance of Seattle derives from the fact that whole of the city (with the notable exception of the industrial area in the center of the city, south of downtown, and extending to South Park and Boeing Field; and to a lesser extent, downtown itself) is filled with small parks, hills, and lakes. Where there had so recently been wilderness, increasingly there was the reality of a major city. The Seattle Symphony was founded in 1903, and while few, if any, other comparably important arts institutions were established, the story was different in more popular entertainments. Vaudeville impresarios Alexander Pantages, John Considine, and John Cort (the last also involved in legitimate theater) were all based in Seattle in this era. Seattle trumpeted and celebrated its rise with the Alaska-Yukon-Pacific Exposition of 1909, but the city's rapid growth had led to much questioning of the social order. Not only the labor left, but also progressives calling for \\"good government\\" challenged the hegemony of the captains of industry. Rail baron James J. Hill, addressing Seattle business leaders in 1909, noted and regretted the change. \\"Where,\\" he asked, \\"are the man who used to match your mountains‚Ä¶?\\"Bill Speidel, Through the Eye of the Needle, Nettle Creek, 1989, , p.78‚Äì79 World War I and the Bogue Plan: 1914-1920 King Street Station, during the brief reign of the Alaska Building as the city's tallest building. Seattle's old downtown post office, 1914 In 1910, Seattle voters approved a referendum to create a development plan for the whole city. However, the result, known as the Bogue plan, was never to be implemented. Virgil Bogue had worked for Olmsted and was intimately familiar with the land in Seattle. The Bogue plan had at its heart a grand civic center in Belltown and the Denny Regrade connected to the rest of the city by a rapid transit rail system, with a huge expansion of the park system, crowned by the total conversion of Mercer Island into parkland. Striking in Bogue's plan is his grasp of the consequences of growth; he foresaw that the city's residents would eventually number in the millions and that such a grand park or efficient transit system could put in place early in the development at much lower cost. However, the Bogue plan was defeated by an alliance of fiscal conservatives who opposed such a grandiose plan on general principles and populists who argued that the plan would mainly benefit the rich: for example, the proposed massive Mercer Island park could, at that time, only be reached by boat. The Bogue plan sat on the shelf, never to be used. Ultimately, a few of the sites proposed for public parks were developed as such; more became private golf courses and such. The rail system was never built, and Mercer Island is now an upper middle class suburb, connected to the city by an Interstate Highway floating bridge. At the same time as the government stopped investing for the future, private enterprise also began to stiffen. The war hid this, because it \\"boomed and expanded Seattle's economy phenomenally, but in false ways.\\" The growth in the size of the economy was unprecedented, increasing nearly tenfold. However, it was almost all in wartime shipbuilding and lumber, and there was very little growth in new industries. Seattle between the Wars When the war ended, so did Seattle's prosperity. Economic output crashed as the government stopped buying boats, and there were no new industries to pick up the slack. Seattle stopped being a place of explosive growth and opportunity. Western Washington was a center of radical labor agitation. Most dramatically, a general strike occurred in 1919, the first in the United States. The Industrial Workers of the World played a prominent role in the strike. After surviving the general strike, Seattle mayor Ole Hanson became a prominent figure in the First Red Scare, and made an unsuccessful attempt to ride that backlash to the White House in an unsuccessful bid for the Republican nomination for the presidential election of 1920. Things picked up in the late 1920s, but then came the Great Depression. Times were rough all over the country, but Seattle was hit particularly hard because the manufacturing industries had been crowded out by the war. For example, Seattle issued 2,538 permits for housing construction in 1930, but only 361 in 1932.Florence K. Lentz and Mimi Sheridan, Queen Anne Historic Context Statement , prepared for the Seattle Department of Neighborhoods, Historic Preservation Program and the Queen Anne Historical Society, October 2005, p. 21. Accessed online 24 July 2008. Seattle saw some of the country's harshest labor strife of the Depression. During the Maritime Strike of 1934, striking longshoremen faced off with police and strikebreakers in a series of daily skirmishes that became known as \\"The Battle of Smith Cove\\". As a result of the violence of the strike, Seattle lost much of its maritime traffic to the Port of Los Angeles.BOLA Architecture + Planning & Northwest Archaeological Associates, Inc., Port of Seattle North Bay Project DEIS: Historic and Cultural Resources , Port of Seattle, April 5, 2005, p. 12-13 (which is p. 14-15 of the PDF).

Accessed online 9 August 2008. that challenged both the Democratic and Republican parties, and was widely accused of \\"fascist\\" or \\"proto-fascist\\" tendencies. Despite this, and despite enormous police corruption, Roger Sale argues that the Seattle between the wars was a pretty nice place to live, especially to grow up in. The city was still full of single-family wood houses and parks from the Olmstead development, but because of the crash they were affordable‚Äîat least to those who still had jobs. Seattle between the wars, writes Sale \\"is what suburbs try to be, but never achieve because they cannot stand things so jammed together, all for a family whose income could be well under two thousand dollars a year.\\" Seattle settled down into a kind of stasis between the wars, as growth subsided while those who lived in the city stayed. Although no longer the economic powerhouse it had been around the start of the 20th century, it was in the 1920s that Seattle first began seriously to be an arts center. The Frye and Henry families put on public display the collections that would become the core of the Frye Art Museum and Henry Art Gallery, respectively. Nellie Cornish had established the Cornish School (now Cornish College of the Arts) in 1914. Australian painter Ambrose Patterson arrived in 1919; over the next few decades Mark Tobey, Morris Graves, Kenneth Callahan, Guy Irving Anderson, and Paul Horiuchi would establish themselves as nationally and internationally known artists. Bandleader Vic Meyers and others kept the speakeasies jumping through the Prohibition era, and by mid-century the thriving jazz scene in the city's Skid Road district would launch the careers of such luminaries as Ray Charles and Quincy Jones.

It borders on Rideau Street, the ByWard Market, the Rideau Canal, the Mackenzie King Bridge, and Nicholas Street in Downtown Ottawa. Over 20 million people visit the mall annually. It is the largest shopping mall and the main transit hub in the National Capital Region. The Rideau Centre complex has approximately 180 retailers, a 487-room Westin Hotel, a rooftop park, and the Shaw Centre (formerly the Ottawa Convention Centre). Independently operated from the mall, Hudson's Bay is linked via a skywalk, while the National Defence Headquarters building is linked through an underground tunnel. History During its construction from 1981 to 1982, the construction of the Rideau Centre is speculated to have been largely controversial and widely opposed by local residents & business owners, as a whole block of stores south of Hudson's Bay Company's \\"The Bay\\" on Rideau Street would've required demolishing, solely to make room for the new building, and vehicle traffic was most likely to increase substantially upon its completion.https://www.historynerd.ca/2018/11/18/the-bay-on-rideau-from- above-1981/ The Eaton's department store chain, one of the partners in the development, faced intense local opposition when it attempted to rename the mall the \\"Rideau Eaton Centre\\" while it was under construction, eventually backing down as a result of the backlash. The mall was officially opened on March 16, 1983. Rideau Centre at Christmas in 2004, before renovations. On September 26, 2013, Cadillac Fairview began the expansion of the 30-year-old shopping centre. The redevelopment project expanded the Rideau Centre by 230,000 square feet and renovated retail and dining spaces. A key feature of the redevelopment project was a 35,000-square-foot dining hall offering 16 eating establishments, seating for 850 people, and reusable dinnerware, glassware, and metal cutlery. The projected cost of the redevelopment project was . As part of the renovation, Tiffany & Co., Kate Spade New York, and Stuart Weitzman opened locations in the mall. Large retailers added during the redevelopment included a 153,725 sq. ft. Nordstrom and a 103,874 sq. ft. Simons. Across the street, the Hudson's Bay Company announced plans for major renovations following the announcement of Nordstrom's opening; the 335,000 sq. ft. downtown flagship will be completely overhauled. This expansion has prompted many retailers already in the Rideau Centre to pursue renovations. Stores such as Harry Rosen have undergone major renovations, capitalizing on the Ottawa area's density of high income salaried government employees. While the Rideau Centre does not have plans to focus on high-end luxury, the company says that the city is more of an ‚Äúaspirational luxury‚Äù marketplace, one step removed from shops such as Louis Vuitton and Prada. Aside from the retail and interior space additions and renovations, the redesigned centre included significant fa√ßade enhancements along Rideau Street including a refurbished Charles Ogilvy heritage fa√ßade. The interior renovation included new quartz flooring, enhanced lighting, glass guardrails and improved amenities. The two pedestrian bridges crossing Rideau St were taken down, with one being demolished and the other renovated. The expansion at the Rideau Centre opened to the public on August 11, 2016, bringing the total retail floor area to over 969,000 sq. ft. Incidents Rideau Centre security and maintenance staff have been the subject of a number of controversies. In 2002, security staff handcuffed and detained two men for carrying an Israeli flag to enforce a mall rule prohibiting political signs. The men claimed that abusive comments were made towards them as Jews, but a police investigation was unable to sustain the allegations of anti-semitic abuse. In 2011, security staff handcuffed and detained a man who was attempting to cancel a gym membership. The man was released when police arrived, and the Rideau Centre's tenant GoodLife Fitness suffered a media backlash over the incident. That year, nine people, including a former Speaker of the House of Commons and other dignitaries, were trapped for more than an hour and a half in the mall elevator. A former Senator criticized the Rideau Centre for its slow response time. In May 2016, a 19 year old man was stabbed in the abdomen in the mall‚Äôs rooftop garden. On the morning of June 8, 2016, the Rideau Centre was evacuated after a sinkhole opened up on Rideau Street. Transport Since September 14, 2019, the Rideau Centre is served by Rideau station on the Confederation Line of Ottawa's O-Train network. Two of the station's four entrances are located within the mall; one near the intersection of Colonel By Drive and Rideau Street, and an accessible entrance near a crosswalk to Hudson's Bay. The Rideau Centre and the adjacent National Defence Headquarters building were served by a stop located on Mackenzie King Bridge, which was a major transit hub on the central Transitway before the opening of the Confederation Line. It is now served by two local routes.

Population: Baltiysk, the westernmost town in Russia, is a major base of the Russian Navy's Baltic Fleet and is a ferry-port on the route to St. Petersburg. History =Old Prussian village= Baltiysk was originally the site of an Old Prussian fishing village that was established on the coast of the Vistula Spit at some point in the 13th century. The village was named as \\"Pile\\" or \\"Pil\\" in several documents, possibly taking its name from pils the Old Prussian language word for fort. It was eventually conquered by the Teutonic Knights, with the name evolving into the German form of Pillau. In 1497, a storm surge dug a new gat in front of the village, and another large storm created the navigable Strait of Baltiysk through the gat on September 10, 1510. This fostered the growth of Pillau into an important port of the Duchy of Prussia, and a blockhouse was constructed in 1537, followed by a system of storehouses in 1543, and the earliest fortifications in 1550. During the Thirty Years' War, the harbor was occupied by Sweden in the aftermath of their victory over the Polish‚ÄìLithuanian Commonwealth, and King Gustavus Adolphus landed there with his reinforcements in May 1626. After the ceasefire of Altmark in 1629, the Swedes retained Pillau and set out upgrading its fortifications, constructing a star fort which remains one of the town's landmarks. In 1635, the citizens of Pillau paid the ransom of 10,000 thalers, whereupon Swedish forces handed over the settlement to the Elector of Brandenburg. =Prussian town= Lighthouse By the end of the 17th century, Pillau had expanded considerably, and a lighthouse and a stone church were built. Peter the Great, the Tsar of Russia, visited Pillau on three occasions, the first being in 1697 in connection with his Grand Embassy to Western Europe. A statue of the Peter the Great currently stands next to the lighthouse. After Pillau was granted town privileges in 1725, the Baroque- style town hall was constructed and inaugurated in May 1745, but was destroyed at the end of World War II. Russian forces occupied the town during the Seven Years' War and built a small Orthodox church there, with the event commemorated by the equestrian statue of Empress Elizabeth, unveiled in 2004. In June 1807, Pillau was stormed by Napoleon's Grande Arm√©e during the Napoleonic Wars, although no outstanding events took place during the rest of the 19th century. Records of a Scottish \\"colony\\" established in Pillau in 1815 appeared in an 1890 publication, although their authenticity is questionable. The lighthouse was built up to a height of and the entire fortress was updated and rebuilt by the Prussians in 1871. The importance of Pillau declined from November 15, 1901, when a shipping canal was opened linking the Vistula Lagoon near Zimmerbude (now Svetly) to K√∂nigsberg. Pillau's economy was heavily based on large shipping vessels being forced to dock in the town due to the shallow depth of the lagoon near K√∂nigsberg, the capital and the largest city of East Prussia, and the goods would then be transported from Pillau to K√∂nigsberg by other means. Constructed at a huge cost of thirteen million marks, the canal allowed vessels of a draught to moor alongside the city or to sail directly to K√∂nigsberg without stopping at Pillau, causing a serious decline to the town's economy. =World War II= Festung Pillau Evacuation of German civilians from Pillau, January 26, 1945, fleeing from the Red Army During World War II, Pillau had a U-boat training facility, and on April 16, 1945, the was sunk by Red Army artillery fire while she was docked near the electricity supply pier in Pillau port, and was the only U-boat to be ever sunk by land-based forces in World War II. As the Red Army entered East Prussia, more than 450,000 refugees were ferried from Pillau to central and western Germany, with the town eventually being captured by Soviets on April 25, 1945. =Modern Baltiysk= Old St George church After the war, Pillau was included in the northern part of East Prussia passed to the Soviet Union that became Kaliningrad Oblast, and the German inhabitants were expelled. During the Russification campaign, the town's name was changed to Baltiysk in 1946. In 1952, the Soviet authorities inaugurated a naval base for the Baltic Fleet of the Soviet Navy at Baltiysk, and as a result it became a closed town with access was forbidden to foreigners or those without a permit. During the Cold War it was served by the Baltiysk Air Base. The town, along with Kaliningrad, remains one of only two year-round ice-free ports along the Baltic Sea coastline available to Russia. In 2019, on a wave of anti-Western sentiment following Russia's annexation of Crimea, there were calls to change the town's German-era coat of arms, which features a sturgeon wearing the crown of King Frederick William I of Prussia. The historic arms had been granted to the town, then known as Pillau, in 1725.Russian court finds illegal German coat of arms of town in far western exclave Administrative and municipal status Within the framework of administrative divisions, Baltiysk serves as the administrative center of Baltiysky District.Resolution #640 As an administrative division, it is, together with two rural localities, incorporated within Baltiysky District as the town of district significance of Baltiysk.

The All Pakistan Awami Muslim League was founded in Dhaka, the capital of the Pakistani province of East Bengal, in 1949 by Bengali nationalists Maulana Abdul Hamid Khan Bhashani, Yar Mohammad Khan, Shamsul Huq, and later Huseyn Shaheed Suhrawardy. In 1953, the party's council meeting voted to drop the word \\"Muslim\\" from its name in order to give it a more secular outlook, owing to the need to include the province's large Hindu population in Pakistani politics. Amongst the leaders of the Awami League, five have become the President of Bangladesh, four have become the Prime Minister of Bangladesh and one became the Prime Minister of Pakistan.

There is the \\"establishment\\" view, which favors the centrality of the Denny Party (generally the Denny, Mercer, Terry, and Boren families), and Henry Yesler. A second, less didactic view, advanced particularly by historian Bill Speidel and others such as Murray Morgan, sees David Swinson \\"Doc\\" Maynard as a key figure, perhaps the key figure. In the late nineteenth century, when Seattle had become a thriving town, several members of the Denny Party still survived; they and many of their descendants were in local positions of power and influence. Maynard was about ten years older and died relatively young, so he was not around to make his own case. The Denny Party were generally conservative Methodists, teetotalers, Whigs and Republicans, while Maynard was a drinker and a Democrat. He felt that well-run prostitution could be a healthy part of a city's economy. He was also on friendly terms with the region's Native Americans, while many of the Denny Party were not. Thus Maynard was not on the best of terms with what became the Seattle Establishment, especially after the Puget Sound War. He was nearly written out of the city's history until Morgan's 1951 book Skid Road and Speidel's research in the 1960s and 1970s. Founding What is now Seattle has been inhabited since at least the end of the last glacial period (c. 8000 BCE-- 10,000 years ago). Archaeological excavations at what is now called West Point in Discovery Park, Magnolia confirm settlement within the current city for at least 4,000 years and probably much longer.

George Vancouver was the first European to visit the Seattle area in May 1792 during his 1791‚Äì95 expedition to chart the Pacific Northwest; the first White forays for sites in the area were in the 1830s.Morgan (1951, 1982), pp. 21-22 The founding of Seattle is usually dated from the arrival of the Denny Party on November 13, 1851, at Alki Point. The group had travelled overland from the Midwest to Portland, Oregon, then made a short ocean journey up the Pacific coast into Puget Sound, with the express intent of founding a town. The next April, Arthur A. Denny abandoned the original site at Alki in favor of a better-protected site on Elliott Bay, near the south end of what is now downtown Seattle. Around the same time, Doc Maynard began settling the land immediately south of Denny's. Charles C. Terry and others hung on at Alki for a few more years, but eventually it became clear that Maynard and Denny had chosen the better location. The first plats for Seattle were filed on May 23, 1853. Nominal legal land settlement was provisionally established in 1855 (with treaty terms for what is now Seattle not implemented). Doc Maynard's land claim lay south of today's Yesler Way, encompassing most of today's Pioneer Square Historical District and the International District. He based his street grid on strict compass bearings. The more northerly plats of Arthur A. Denny and Carson D. Boren encompassed Pioneer Square north of what is now Yesler Way; the heart of the current downtown; and the western slope of First Hill. These had street grids that more or less followed the shoreline. The downtown grid from Yesler Way north to Stewart Street is oriented 32 degrees west of north; from Stewart north to Denny Way the orientation is 49 degrees west of north. The result is a tangle of streets where the grids clash. (See also Street layout of Seattle.) Both Alki and the settlement that was to become Seattle relied in their early decades on the timber industry, shipping out logs (and, later, milled timber) to build and rebuild San Francisco which, as Bill Speidel points out, kept burning down. Seattle and Alki offered plenty of trees to build San Francisco and plenty of hills to slide them down to water. A climax forest of trees up to 1,000-2,000 years old and towering as high as nearly covered much of what is now Seattle. Today, none of that size remain anywhere in the world.Dolan & True (2003), pp. 142, 144Van Pelt (2001) pp. xxii, 181-185, 187-191 Relations with the natives This section draws heavily on Bill Speidel, Sons of the Profits (1967) and Doc Maynard (1978). Doc Maynard and Murray Morgan, Skid Road (1951, 1960, 1982) are especially useful on the events regarding resistance nominally led by Kamiakim in the January 1856 attack on the town. = Generally before the Point Elliott Treaty = The early Seattle settlers had a sometimes rocky relationship with the local Native Americans. There is no question that the settlers were steadily taking away native lands and, in many cases, treating the natives terribly. There were numerous deadly attacks by settlers against natives and by natives against settlers. Bill Speidel writes in Sons of the Profits, \\"The general consensus of the community was that killing an Indian was a matter of no graver consequence than shooting a cougar or a bear...\\" Against this background, Doc Maynard stands out for his excellent relations with the natives. He and Chief Seattle were friends and allies: Maynard certainly profited greatly from this friendship, but that should not diminish the fact that during the outbreak of violent hostilities in 1856 he risked the wrath of his fellow settlers by protecting neutral Indians. However, outside of some old-time trappers and traders, he was almost unique in his attitude. Denny and Edward Lander (the latter was the first local federal judge) also stood out in that they believed that the law should be applied fairly and equally: to them, murder was murder, regardless of the race of the victim. However, it was impossible to get this view upheld by a jury. In Sons of the Profits Speidel recounts a case of two vigilantes who had hanged a native man. After a series of (possibly deliberate) irregularities in their trial, the jury acquitted these obviously guilty men on a technicality. Territorial Governor Isaac Stevens probably did more damage to relations between settlers and natives than any one other person. He put a bounty on scalps of \\"bad Indians\\". He declared martial law to prevent Lander from issuing writs of habeas corpus for people who were held in jail for little other reason than sympathizing with the natives. On at least two occasions, he actually had Lander himself jailed. Perhaps worst of all in its consequences for relations, he dealt dishonestly in treaties, among other things making oral promises that were not matched by what was written down. The local natives had at least a thirty-year history of dealing with the Hudson's Bay Company, who had developed a reputation for driving a hard bargain, but sticking honestly to what they agreed to, and for treating Whites and Indians impartially. This continued through the dealings of the local Bureau of Indian Affairs Superintendent General, Joel Palmer, who (along with Maynard's brother-in-law, Indian Agent Mike Simmons) was among the few even-handed men in the BIA. Consequently, when Stevens, in drafting treaties, acted in a manner that Judge James Wickerson would characterize forty years later as \\"unfair, unjust, ungenerous, and illegal\\", some natives, quite unprepared for such behavior by the official representatives of the white man's power, were angered to the point of war. The unjust and deliberately confusing Western Washington treaties such as that of Medicine Creek (December 26, 1854) and Point Elliott (now Mukilteo) (January 22, 1855) were followed by the yet more provocative Treaty of Walla Walla (May 21, 1855), as Stevens pointedly ignored federal government instructions to stick to sorting out the areas where natives and settlers found themselves immediately adjacent to one another, or, from the other perspective, where settlers moved right in on Native places. = Generally after the Point Elliott Treaty = By the time of the Treaty of Point Elliott, Maynard had already made an ally of Chief Seattle by arranging to have him somewhat compensated for the use of his name for the new town. Chief Seattle's ancestral religion and Coast Salish culture have beliefs opposed to speaking or using a person's name after that person's death and prior to protocols, so this was not a simple matter, although Chief Seattle soon converted to a somewhat eclectic Roman Catholicism. (See also Duwamish). At Point Elliott, Maynard cemented this alliance (and greatly benefited his emerging town) by getting Chief Seattle and the Duwamish a separate, more favorable treaty, which, in exchange for a relatively large reservation (promised, not yet ever fulfilled), Natives abandoned all aboriginal title to , constituting an area almost identical to the eventual twentieth-century city limits of the City of Seattle, for nearly nothing at the time. With Stevens in Eastern Washington sowing discord, Secretary of State Charles Mason was left in charge of the state government. Yakama Chief Kamiakim had effectively declared war and told nations such as the Duwamish that they could either join him or would be treated as enemies. By autumn, there had been an exchange of massacres by Whites and settlers, in which both sides seemed ready to kill whichever people of the other race were at hand, with no regard for whether these particular individuals had in any way previously wronged them. (This cycle of retaliatory violence would reach its logical conclusion two years after the war, when the brilliant and generally respected si'ab Lescay (Chief Leschi) was tried and condemned to death for a murder he almost certainly did not commit, and hanged before his appeal could be properly heard.) Maynard got Mike Simmons to deputize him as a Special Indian Agent, then--in a complex, multi-way transaction--cemented a relationship with acting governor Mason and some other key figures by selling them some prime Seattle real estate at a good price. He then used the money from the transaction to buy supplies and a boat to ferry Chief Seattle and his Duwamish to what was effectively a privately funded reservation at Port Madison, west of Puget Sound. He also, at enormous personal risk, spent the first several weeks of November 1855 traveling around eastern King County, which was already penetrated by some of Kamiakim's men, informing several hundred other neutral natives that there was a safe place they could go. Most of them took him up on it. Induced fear effected abandonment of places Natives were otherwise loath to leave. (In Doc Maynard, Bill Speidel reports that not all of the Seattle businessmen were pleased with his getting the local Indians out of the way. Henry Yesler and others found themselves deprived of much of their labor force and wrote letters of protest to the territorial government.) Shortly before Stevens returned to Olympia January 16, 1856, Captain E.D. Keyes had managed an uneasy informal truce by communicating with, among others, Chief Leschi. Stevens promptly undercut the truce, saying of the natives, \\"Nothing but death is mete punishment for their perfidy\\". On January 25, 1856, Stevens announced, \\"The town of Seattle is in as much danger of an Indian attack as are the cities of San Francisco or New York\\". On January 26, 1856, natives attacked the Seattle settlement. Friendly Indians permitted to stay in Seattle had warned the Whites, and sentries had been put on patrol. In the morning, acting on tip, a shell was lobbed into the forest above the town, what is now First Hill. First fire. The Indians fired back, small arms. Settlers rushed from their cabins to the blockhouse. The defenses were based on a large wooden blockhouse, a five-foot-high wood-and- earth breastworks, various ravines--and the cannon just offshore zeroed (bearing and range laid in). The settlement was defended at the time by the 150 man, 566 ton, 16 gun sloop-of-war Decatur, the bark Bronte, seven out-of- town civilian volunteers, fifty local volunteers, and at least 6 Marines from the Decatur The number of attackers is impossible to establish: estimates range from a mere thirty to 2000 with more than a hundred killed, another hundred wounded. Not so much as a single Indian body was ever found, not even a sign of blood. The Indians had made no attempt to storm the stockade. No one in the blockhouse was much interested in venturing out on attack. Both sides had paused for dinner. There were two known fatalities: a young volunteer and a 14-year-old boy, both of whom had neglected to stay behind cover. No one who kept inside the stockade was wounded. A few things do seem clear in this fog of war: nearly all of the local volunteers hardly left the blockhouse, the Navy took no combat casualties in this land battle, and Kamiakim's forces were successfully driven off, but also took few (if any) fatalities.Morgan (1951, 1982), pp. 31-51 Still, they seem to have drawn the conclusion that attacking a major settlement wasn't worth the trouble. The only remaining major battle of the war was to occur March 10 at Connell's Prairie near Puyallup. = After the skirmish \\"Battle of Seattle\\" = The cessation of general hostilities did not diminish Stevens' crusading zeal against the natives. He encouraged fratricidal war by offering the \\"good Indians\\" a bounty for scalps of the \\"bad Indians\\". The largest collector of such rewards was Chief Seattle's sworn rival, Chief Patkanim, a leader among the Snoqualmie and Snohomish. According to Speidel, Patkanim was not above killing and scalping his own slaves as a means of generating income. Speidel also narrates (in Sons of the Profits) that on one occasion this led to a native being killed and scalped in Stevens' own office. Stevens continually attempted to recruit Chief Seattle and the Duwamish to this cause. Maynard and Chief Seattle, who had already gone to great lengths to help keep the Duwamish at a safe distance from Patkanim, never actually refused the Governor's request, but instead maintained a successful pattern of stalling and passive resistance to avoid ever providing any Duwamish fighters to further Stevens' scheme. A smallpox epidemic broke out among the Northwest tribes in 1862, killing roughly half of the native population. Documentation in archives and historical epidemiology demonstrates that Governmental policies furthered the progress of the epidemic among the natives.(1) Boyd (2) Lange (4 February 2003, Essay 5171) (2.1) Lange (8 December 2000, Essay 3176) [Summary] The Seattle Establishment, including 'Doc' Maynard, petitioned the Territorial Delegate to Congress in 1866 to deny treaty rights to the Duwamish.

McLain, to start a steam sawmill once he had isolated the perfect location for such a structure\\",Speidel (1967), p. 60 he chose a Seattle location, on the waterfront where Maynard and Denny's plats met. Thereafter, Seattle would dominate the lumber industry. Yesler selected this location because of a critical flaw with Alki as a port: \\"During the winter, the north wind, building up the tides in front of it, comes sweeping down the Sound out of Canada, piling mighty waves on Alki Point. Beginning with Terry... nobody has been able to build anything out in the water at Alki that will withstand those waves\\".Speidel (1967), p. 33 The road leading down the hill to that mill, later called Mill Street and now known as Yesler Way, was originally known as the Skid Road, the route for skidding logs down to the mill, hence the term \\"Skid Road\\" or corrupted as \\"Skid Row\\" for a rundown or dilapidated urban area as the mill declined and the area collapsed with the Crash and Great Depression. Authors referenced Walt Crowley, National Trust Guide Seattle (New York: John Wiley & Sons, Inc., 1998); Lee Moriwaki, \\"Downtown's Changing Face\\", The Seattle Times, February 23, 1997. Information on the Smith Tower was corrected on September 2, 2004. Via the bargaining power of his mill, Yesler wrangled about of prime land from some of the original settlers. Besides his mill, Yesler started a cookhouse that \\"did more to 'set' the heart of the city in the middle of Yesler's property holdings than anything else Henry did. Henry never did make a lot of money out of his mill. It was the strategic location of his land that made him a millionaire\\".Speidel (1967), p. 63 Like many of Seattle's early entrepreneurs, Yesler was not always the most scrupulous about how he made his money; he borrowed $30,000 at 8% interest to build the mill, and repaid McLain only after McLain took Yesler to court three times. A city grows Seattle, engraving from \\"Harper's New Monthly Magazine\\" (September 1870). The first Seattle fortunes were founded on logs, and later milled timber, shipped south for the construction of buildings in San Francisco. Seattle itself, in the early years, was, of course, also a place of wooden buildings, and remained so until the Great Fire of June 6, 1889. Even the early system of delivering water to the settlement used hollowed-out logs for pipes. Seattle in its early years relied on the timber industry, shipping logs (and, later, milled timber) to San Francisco. Terry sold out Alki (which, after his departure barely held on as a settlement), moved to Seattle and began acquiring land. He either owned or partially owned the first ships that allowed Seattle's timber industry to exist by providing a means to move the product to market. He eventually gave a land grant to the University of the Territory of Washington that housed its original campus and today makes the University of Washington a downtown landlord collecting rents of more than $1 million a year. He worked in politics to establish street grades, a water system, and a host of other services (which, not coincidentally, benefited him as one of the city's largest landholders). Meanwhile, Arthur Denny became the second richest man in town, after Yesler, and got himself elected to territorial legislature. From that position, he tried unsuccessfully to get the territorial capital moved to Seattle from its then supposedly temporary location in Olympia. The other potential money prizes were the territorial penitentiary and the territorial university. When the politics all played out, Vancouver wound up as the proposed capital, Port Townsend was supposed to get the penitentiary, and Seattle got the university. Apparently, Seattle was the only real winner in this deal: to this day, Olympia remains the capital of Washington; the main state penitentiary is in Walla Walla. The legislature had tacked on the requirement that a grant of of land would be required for the university to be built, which they presumably thought would be sufficient to prevent its construction. However, Denny wanted his town to grow and donated the land, creating what would be \\"one of the biggest and most effective central core properties in the United States\\".Speidel (1967), p. 89 The University of the Territory of Washington (later the University of Washington) opened on November 4, 1861. There were barely enough students to run it as a high school, let alone as a university, but over time it grew into its originally grandiose name. The logging town developed rapidly into a small city. Despite being officially founded by the Methodists of the Denny Party, Seattle quickly developed a reputation as a wide-open town, a haven for prostitution, liquor, and gambling. Some attribute this, at least in part, to Maynard, who arrived separately from the Denny Party, and who had a rather different view of what it would take to build a city, based on his experience in growing Cleveland, Ohio. By selling some of his land cheaply on condition that businesses be soon built upon them, he recruited professionals, such as blacksmiths and purveyors of vice, who enhanced the value of his remaining land. The city's first brothel dated from 1861 and was founded by one John Pinnell (or Pennell), who was already involved in similar business in San Francisco. Real estate records show that nearly all of the city's first 60 businesses were on, or immediately adjacent to, Maynard's plat. Second Ave. and Marion St., Seattle, Wash., July 1889 Seattle was incorporated as a town January 14, 1865. The incorporators were Charles C. Terry, Henry L. Yesler, David T. Denny, Charles Plummer and Hiram Burnett, an officer of the largest Puget Sound lumber company Pope & Talbot. That charter was voided January 18, 1867, in response to unrest. Seattle was re-incorporated as a city on December 2, 1869. At the times of incorporation, the population was approximately 350 and 1,000, respectively.Clarence B. Bagley, History of Seattle from the Earliest Settlement to the Present Time, Vol. 2 (Chicago: S.J. Publishing Co., 1916), p. 698. NB: Per Original source not checked  Railroad rivalry and encroaching civilization  Seattle, looking south from Pine Street, 1880. On July 14, 1873, the Northern Pacific Railway announced that they had chosen the then-small town of Tacoma over Seattle as the Western terminus of their transcontinental railroad. The railroad barons appear to have been gambling on the advantage they could gain from being able to buy up the land around their terminus cheaply instead of bringing the railroad into a more established Pacific port town. Unwilling to be bypassed, the citizens of Seattle chartered their own railroad, the Seattle & Walla Walla, to link with the Union Pacific Railroad in eastern Washington. The S&WW; never got beyond Renton, but that was far enough to connect with new coal mines, fueling industry in Seattle. The later Seattle, Lake Shore & Eastern Railway was only moderately more successful, although it did provide a route for logs to come to the city from as far away as Arlington, Washington, boost development of towns, and help Seattle hit the jackpot with the Northern Pacific. The Great Northern Railway chose Seattle as the terminus for its transcontinental road in 1893, winning Seattle a place in competition for freight traffic to California and across the Pacific. The Seattle, Lake Shore & Eastern was, over the years, incorporated into the Northern Pacific and then the Burlington Northern railways.Speidel (1967), pp. 196-197, 200Dorpat (1994), ch. 42 The line was abandoned as a railroad in 1971 with the general decline in rail, and became in 1978 a foot and bicycle route renamed the Burke-Gilman Trail, then gradually greatly extended. Seattle's first streetcar, 1884, at the corner of Occidental and Yesler. Second Av. & Yesler Way, Seattle, 1904 As has been remarked, Seattle in this era was an \\"open\\" and often relatively lawless town. Although it boasted two English- language newspapers (and, for a while, a third in Norwegian), and telephones had arrived in town, lynch law sometimes prevailed (there were at least four lynchings in 1882), schools barely operated, and indoor plumbing was a rare novelty. In the low mud flats where much of the city was built, sewage was almost as likely to come in on the tide as to flow away. Potholes in the street were so bad that legend has it there was at least one fatal drowning. A lynching in 1882 drawn by A. W. Piper. The 1882 lynchings are well described in Murray Morgan's book Skid Road. The events involved a mob defying an armed sheriff, successfully disarming the sheriff's deputies, and assaulting Judge Roger Sherman Greene, who attempted to slash the ropes by which the lynching victims were to be hanged. Judge Greene, while not doubting the actual guilt of the lynched men, was later to write that \\"the lynchers were co-criminal with the lynched\\". Some Seattle schools in 1900. In an era during which the Washington Territory was one of the first parts of the U.S. to (briefly) allow women's suffrage, Seattle women attempted to counter these trends and to be a civilizing influence. On April 4, 1884, 15 Seattle women founded The Ladies Relief Society to address \\"the number of needy and suffering cases within the limits of the city\\". This eventually resulted in the founding of the Seattle Children's Home, still in operation today. Other signs of encroaching civilization were the city's first bathtub with plumbing in 1870,Phelps, p.198 and first streetcar in 1884, followed by a cable car from downtown over First Hill to Leschi Park in 1887. In 1885, the city passed an ordinance requiring attached sewer lines for all new residences. In 1886, the city got its first YMCA gymnasium, and in 1888 the exclusive Rainier Club was founded. On December 24, 1888, ferry service was inaugurated, connecting Seattle to West Seattle, near the location of the Denny Party's first attempt at settling at Alki and reviving that settlement. A year later, a bridge was built across Salmon Bay, providing a land route to the nearby town of Ballard, which after 17 years would be annexed to Seattle. The relative fortunes of Seattle and Tacoma clearly show the nature of Seattle's growth. Though both Seattle and Tacoma grew at a rapid rate from 1880 to 1890, based on the strength of their timber industries, Seattle's growth as an exporter of services and manufactured goods continued for another two decades, while Tacoma's growth dropped almost to zero. The reason for this lies in Tacoma's nature as a company town and Seattle's successful avoidance of that condition. Both Seattle and Tacoma in the 1880s were essentially lumber towns, built on the resulting export income. All over the Puget Sound there are communities that started with the same assets, timber and a port. However, Seattle's early lead with Yesler's mill and other enterprises meant that its economy was based on manufacturing as well as lumber, and was thus far more diversified than Tacoma's. The Northern Pacific Railway terminus only increased Tacoma's lumber trade instead of diversifying the economy. Meanwhile, Seattle became the hub for the region and the railroad had to come. Relations between whites and Chinese Chinese first arrived in Seattle around 1860. The Northern Pacific Railway completed the project of laying tracks from Lake Superior to Tacoma, Washington, in 1883, leaving many Chinese laborers without employment. In 1883, Chinese laborers played a key role in the first effort at digging the Montlake Cut to connect Lake Union's Portage Bay to Lake Washington's Union Bay. Seattle's Chinese district, located near the present day Occidental Park, was a mixed neighborhood of residences over stores, laundries, and other retail storefronts. In fall 1885, with a shortage of jobs in the West, many workers turned violently anti-Chinese, complaining of overly cheap labor competition. In the Pacific Northwest, this had the unusual character that the anti-Chinese mobs included significant numbers of the native Indians as well as European-Americans. The first massacre of Chinese occurred at Rock Springs, Wyoming, September 2, 1885. On September 7, Chinese hop-pickers were massacred in the Squak valley near present-day Issaquah. Similar incidents occurred in the nearby mining camps at Coal Creek and Black Diamond. Many Chinese headed from these isolated rural areas into the cities, but it did them little good: on October 24, a mob burned a large portion of Seattle's Chinatown; on November 3, a mob of 300 expelled the Chinese in Tacoma (loading them into boxcars with surprisingly little actual violence) before moving on to force similar expulsions in smaller towns. Harpweek , on-line database of Harper's Weekly, oldest extant periodical in the U.S.Morgan, p.82, 85 Violent opposition to the Chinese at this time was inseparable from labor union organizing. The pro-labor Seattle Call routinely described the Chinese in brutally racist terms; leading figures in the anti-Chinese movement included Knights of Labor organizer Dan Cronin and Seattle socialist agitator Mary Kenworthy; the utopian socialist George Venable Smith was also of this party. Nor did the Chinese have many strong defenders among the wealthier classes, who, however, mostly favored a more orderly departure of the Chinese to massacre and riot (the policy of Henry Yesler, who was serving as mayor at this time).Morgan (1960), pp. 80-86 A contemporary depiction of events related to the anti-Chinese riot of 1886. Among the few defenders of the rule of law were the Methodist Episcopal Ministers' Association and Judge Thomas Burke. Burke, an Irish immigrant and generally a friend of labor, was nonetheless a stronger defender of the Constitution; he also spoke out that his fellow Irish should identify with the Chinese as fellow immigrants, a view which fell almost entirely on deaf ears.Morgan (1960), pp. 86-87 On February 7, 1886, well-organized anti-Chinese \\"order committees\\" descended on Seattle's Chinatown, claiming to be health inspectors, declaring Chinese-occupied buildings to be unfit for habitation, rousting out the residents and herding them down to the harbor, where the Queen of the Pacific was docked. The police were willing to intervene only to the point of preventing the Chinese from being physically harmed, not to challenging the mob. It is quite probable that if ship's captain Jack Alexander had been willing simply to board the Chinese and take them away, the mob would entirely have ruled the day; however, he was not in the business of hauling non-paying passengers. The mob raised several hundred dollars, 86 Chinese were boarded, but this delay gave the mayor, Judge Burke, the U.S. Attorney, and others time both to rally the Home Guard and to serve Alexander with a writ of habeas corpus. A plot to deport the Chinese by rail was foiled when Sheriff McGraw threatened to prosecute the railroad superintendent for kidnapping.Morgan (1960), pp. 90-93 The following day, Judge Greene made it clear that those Chinese who wished to remain would be protected, but by now, after what they had been through, all but sixteen preferred to leave. Alexander, by now, \\"was anxious to keep his operations strictly legal\\",Morgan (1960), p. 93 and would board only the 196 passengers for which his ship was rated, slightly more than half of the Chinese who were ready to leave. Possibly due to poor communication, the anti-Chinese faction were unsatisfied; a resulting scuffle resulted in one dead and four others wounded among the anti-Chinese faction, and martial law was imposed. Ultimately, the bulk of the Chinese remained in Seattle, and the U.S. government \\"out of humane consideration and without reference to liability\\" paid out $276,619.15 to the Chinese government, but nothing to the victims themselves.Morgan (1960), pp. 93-97 The Great Seattle Fire The early Seattle era came to a stunning halt with the Great Seattle Fire of June 6, 1889. It burned 29 city blocks, destroying most of the central business district; no one, however, perished in the flames, and the city quickly rebounded from the destruction. Thanks in part to credit arranged by Jacob Furth (as well as, according to Speidel, brothel-owner Lou Graham), Seattle rebuilt from the ashes with astounding rapidity. A new zoning code resulted in a downtown of brick and stone buildings, rather than wood. In the single year after the fire, the city grew from 25,000 to 40,000 inhabitants, largely because of the enormous number of construction jobs suddenly created.Speidel (1989), p. 52. Labor history in 19th century Seattle Rainier Beer bottles, 1900. The Pacific Northwest economy during the nineteenth century was heavily rooted in extractive industries, mainly logging. Still, Seattle was becoming a city, and union organizing arrived first in the form of a skilled craft union. In 1882, Seattle printers formed the Seattle Typographical Union Local 202. Dockworkers followed in 1886, cigarmakers in 1887, tailors in 1889, and both brewers and musicians in 1890. Even the newsboys unionized in 1892, followed by more organizing, mostly of craft unions. According to various analyses and as evident through general readings in news coverage of the time, the history of labor in this period is inseparable from the issue of anti- Chinese vigilantism, as discussed above. A rough-and-ready approach to labor organizing was typical of the period, and there is no question that white Seattle-area laborers at this time saw cheap Chinese labor as their prime competition and strove to eliminate it by eliminating the Chinese immigrants. This section is still mostly a stub. You can help Wikipedia by fixing it. The Klondike Gold Rush Central Waterfront during the Gold Rush (1897) Railroad Avenue (now Alaskan Way) along the Seattle waterfront, 1900 Seattle, as well as the rest of the nation, was hard hit by the Panic of 1893 and, to a lesser extent, the Panic of 1896. Unlike many other cities, it soon found salvation in the form of becoming the main transportation and supply center for stampeders heading for the Klondike gold rush. When the steamer SS Portland arrived at Schwabacher's Wharf in Seattle July 17, 1897, the Seattle Post-Intelligencer scooped all other U.S. newspapers with the story that a \\"ton of gold\\" had arrived from Alaska. A publicity campaign engineered largely by Erastus Brainerd successfully convinced the world that Seattle was the place to be outfitted for the journey to Alaska, and Seattle became a household name, literally overnight. The miners mined the gold. Seattle mined the miners. Seattle's relationship with Alaska during this period was generally one of rapacity. Besides the mining, on October 18, 1899 in Pioneer Square, a Chamber of Commerce \\"Committee of Fifteen\\", just back from a goodwill visit to Alaska, proudly unveiled a totem pole from Fort Tongass. The problem was, the pole had been stolen from the Tlingit village of Gaash on Cape Fox. A federal grand jury in Alaska indicted eight of Seattle's most prominent citizens for theft of government property. A nominal fine was assessed.(1) Wilma (1 January 2000, Essay 2076) The village was repaid when the original burned and the Chamber of Commerce commissioned a replacement-- and paid twice. \\"Thank you for the check\\", wrote the Gaash village leaders. \\"That was payment for the first one. Send another check for the replacement\\".

Each archipelago is made up of a number of Atlantic oceanic islands formed by seamounts on the ocean floor with peaks above the ocean's surface. The Macaronesian islands belong to three countries: Portugal, Spain, and Cape Verde. Politically, the islands belonging to Portugal and Spain are part of the European Union. Geologically, Macaronesia is part of the African Plate, including the Azores, which mark its edge at the meeting point with the Eurasian and North American Plates. According to the European Environment Agency, the three European archipelagos (i.e., not including Cape Verde) constitute a unique biogeographic realm: the Macaronesian Region. Etymology The name is derived from the Greek words for \\"islands of the fortunate\\" (, ), a term used by Ancient Greek geographers for islands to the west of the Strait of Gibraltar. Macaronesia is occasionally misspelled \\"Macronesia\\" in false analogy with Micronesia, an unrelated group of archipelagos in the Pacific Ocean.  Archipelagos  Macaronesia consists of four main archipelagos. From north to south, these are: * the Azores, an Autonomous Region of Portugal * Madeira (also including the Savage Islands), an Autonomous Region of Portugal * the Canary Islands, an Autonomous Community of Spain * Cape Verde, an independent West African country Geography and geology Macaronesian archipelagos were, and are still, created by volcanic activity. Layers of volcanic tephra formed by the 1957 eruption of Capelinhos volcano on the island of Faial in the Azores. The islands of Macaronesia are volcanic in origin, and are thought to be the product of several geologic hotspots. The climate of the Macaronesian islands ranges from maritime temperate, Mediterranean and subtropical in the Azores and Madeira, Mediterranean and subtropical in some Canary islands to arid in certain geologically older islands of the Canaries (Lanzarote, Fuerteventura), some islands of the Madeira Archipelago (Selvagens and Porto Santo) and Cape Verde (Sal, Boa Vista and Maio), and even tropical in the younger islands of both southern archipelagos (Santo Ant√£o, Santiago and Fogo in Cape Verde). In some cases there are variations due to the rain shadow effect. The laurisilva forests of Macaronesia are a type of mountain cloud forest with relict species of a vegetation type which originally covered much of the Mediterranean Basin when the climate of that region was more humid. The species have evolved to adapt to the islands‚Äô conditions and many are endemic. The islands have a unique biogeography, and are home to several distinct plant and animal communities. The jumping spider genus Macaroeris is named after Macaronesia. None of the Macaronesian islands were part of a continent, so the native plants and animals reached the islands via long-distance dispersal. Laurel- leaved forests, called laurisilva, once covered most of the Azores, Madeira, and parts of the Canaries between 400 and 1200 m altitude (the eastern Canaries and Cape Verde being too dry). These forests resemble the ancient forests that covered the Mediterranean basin and northwestern Africa before the cooling and drying of the ice ages. Trees of the genera Apollonias, Clethra, Dracaena, Ocotea, Persea, and Picconia, which are found in the Macaronesian laurel forests, are also known from fossil evidence to have lived around the Mediterranean before the ice ages. Conservation issues Primeval laurisilva forest. Some remaining patches of this threatened original native nature in Macaronesia were protected by law in 2001, except in Cape Verde. Felling of the forests for timber and firewood, clearing vegetation for grazing and agriculture, and the introduction of foreign plants and animals by humans have displaced much of the original native vegetation. The laurisilva habitat has been reduced to small disconnected pockets. As a result, many of the endemic biota of the islands are now seriously endangered or extinct. Alien predators - in particular domestic and feral cats - are currently one of the most serious threats to the endemic fauna. Despite the fact that cats prey mostly on introduced mammals, such as rodents and rabbits, this feeding sustains a bigger feline population (thought to be a hyperpredation process), and has a further impact on the endemic reptiles and birds. In the European part of Macaronesia (Azores, Madeira and Canary Islands), conservation efforts include large areas protected by the Natura 2000 regulations of the European Union, since 2001. All in all, 5000 km¬≤ of land and sea are protected area in these three archipelagos.

Early life Morello was born in 1923 in Marseilles, Illinois. In 1954, she earned a master's degree in African and Latin American/Peru history at Loyola University in Chicago. She spent the rest of the decade teaching English in Germany, Peru, and Japan while once circling the globe on a freighter. From 1960‚Äì63, Morello lived in Kenya where she married Ngethe Njoroge (brother of Njoroge Mungai and Jemimah Gecaga), an activist who promoted Kenyan independence from the British during the Mau Mau Uprising (1952‚Äì1960) and later became the first Kenyan delegate to the United Nations. Career In the 1960s, Morello was involved in the Civil Rights Movement and the NAACP. She is a long-time activist for the Chicago Urban League. In 1964, she and her husband moved to Harlem, New York, where she gave birth to their son, Tom. Morello and Ngethe divorced when Tom was one year old in 1965. Morello then moved with her son to Libertyville, Illinois, a small suburb north of Chicago. She took a job at Libertyville High School teaching social studies and US history. In 1987, she quit her teaching job of twenty-two years and founded Parents for Rock and Rap, an anti- censorship counterweight to Tipper Gore's Parents Music Resource Center. She made three trips to the Soviet Union, through Siberia and Mongolia. In 1991, Morello and many others battled against legislation being proposed in Congress titled Pornography Victims Compensation Act, numbered S. 983, or, later, S. 1521. The legislation was not enacted, in part because of grass-roots activism. On June 24, 1996, she received the Hugh M. Hefner First Amendment Award in Arts and Entertainment for her work with Parents for Rock and Rap. In the fall of 1991, Morello began a volunteer teaching job at the Salvation Army Rehabilitation Center in Waukegan, Illinois, where she taught adult literacy. She was involved in the Cuba Coalition in Chicago, which works toward lifting the U.S. embargo against Cuba. Morello is also known for her involvement in the 1999 debate on the incarceration of death row inmate Mumia Abu-Jamal, convicted (some believe wrongly) of the 1982 shooting of a Philadelphia police officer. In an editorial she said: In 2007, Morello had a podcast together with Cindy Sheehan called The Mary Morello and Cindy Sheehan Show.

The \\"Block U\\" has overlooked the University of Utah from Federal Heights since 1907.Block U - Trademarks and Licensing , Trademarks and Licensing Program: The University of Utah The name \\"Federal Heights\\" originates from the period between the Mormon settlers' establishment of Salt Lake City in 1847 and Utah's admittance to the United States as a state in 1896. During this period of time, the Federal Government of the United States established Fort Douglas in the foothills of the Wasatch Mountains above Salt Lake City (not far from the present-day neighborhood) in order to keep an eye on the settlers. Through the efforts of Utah's U.S. Senator Thomas Kearns (1901-1905), Fort Douglas became a regimental post. The officers of the fort established their homesteads to the north-east, creating the Federal Heights neighborhood.

There are 273 YouthBuild programs in the United States, with a total capacity of about 10,000 students yearly, and there are similar programs underway in over 15 countries. The headquarters are in Somerville, Massachusetts.\\"Contact Us.\\" YouthBuild. Retrieved on September 10, 2012. \\"YouthBuild USA 58 Day Street Somerville, MA 02144\\" The YouthBuild program has five components: construction, education, counseling, leadership, and graduate opportunity. Students spend every other week on a job site, learning the construction trade by building homes for their own communities. This creates housing for low- income people, and also gives the students marketable job skills. The alternate weeks are spent on education in the YouthBuild classroom, with the goal of attaining a GED or completing their high school diploma. Many YouthBuild students come directly from the streets or from difficult life situations, so counseling is available to help them deal with anger management, family responsibilities, and other adjustment / life direction issues. Leadership is taught explicitly in YouthBuild programs, based on the philosophy that young people are not a burden, but rather a resource to be tapped. This, combined with ensuring opportunity and placement for graduates, means that many YouthBuild graduates go on to college, work in the non-profit sector, serve on committees, or even run in local politics. Funding for YouthBuild previously came primarily from the Department of Housing and Urban Development, but has transitioned to the Department of Labor. Other funding sources for programs are widely varied, but include other government agencies, private foundations, corporations, and individual donors. Founded and directed by Dorothy Stoneman and John Bell , one of the main purposes of YouthBuild is to build affordable housing for low-income families. Since 1994, more than 19,000 homes have been built by 92,000 YouthBuild students. See also *Youth On Board References Further reading * Bell, J. (n.d.).

He is often considered the last independent ruler of Frisia before Frankish domination. He defeated Charles Martel at Cologne. Eventually, Charles prevailed and compelled the Frisians to submit. Redbad died in 719, but for some years his successors struggled against the Frankish power.  King or duke  What the exact title of the Frisian rulers was depends on the source. Frankish sources tend to call them dukes; other sources often call them kings. Being Germanic pagans, it is likely that they would have been called kings by their followers, whereas the Christianized Franks, who had inherited the Latin literary tradition, would have referred to them as dukes.  Reign  While his predecessor, Aldgisl, had welcomed Christianity into his realm, Redbad attempted to extirpate the religion and free the Frisians from subjugation to the Merovingian kingdom of the Franks. In 689, however, Redbad was defeated by Pepin of Herstal in the battle of Dorestad and compelled to cede Frisia Citerior (Nearer Frisia, from the Scheldt to the Vlie) to the Franks. Between 690 and 692, Utrecht fell into the hands of Pepin. This gave the Franks control of important trade routes on the Rhine to the North Sea. Some sources say that, following this defeat, Redbad retreated, in 697, to the island of Heligoland. Others say he retreated to the part of the Netherlands that is still known as Friesland. Around this time there was an Archbishopric or bishopric of the Frisians founded for Willibrord it Liber Pontificalis (Corpus XXXVI 1, side 168) en Beda Venerabilis (Corpus XLVI9, page 218) and a marriage was held between Grimoald the Younger, the oldest son of Pepin, and Thiadsvind, the daughter of Redbad in 711. On Pepin's death in 714, Redbad took the initiative again. He forced Saint Willibrord and his monks to flee and advanced as far as Cologne, where he defeated Charles Martel, Pepin's natural son, in 716. Eventually, however, Charles prevailed and compelled the Frisians to submit. Redbad died in 719, but for some years his successors struggled against the Frankish power. As an example of how powerful King Redbad still was at the end of his life, the news that he was engaged in assembling an army was reportedly enough to fill the Frankish kingdom with fear and trembling.  Relation with the Roman Catholic Church  During the second journey of Saint Boniface to Rome, Wulfram (or Vulfran), a monk and ex- archbishop of Sens tried to convert Redbad, but after an unsuccessful attempt he returned to Fontenelle. It is said that Redbad was nearly baptised but refused when he was told that he would not be able to find any of his ancestors in Heaven after his death. He said he preferred spending eternity in Hell with his pagan ancestors than in Heaven with a pack of beggars.Friese sagen & Terugkeer (2000), Conserve, Uitgeverij, Redbald en Wulfram. This legend is also told with Wulfram being replaced with bishop Willibrord  Legacy  Portrait of Redbad (Radboud Castle) Saint Radboud was a descendant of Redbad. Saint Radboud was a bishop of Utrecht who adopted his ancestor's native name. The Nijmegen University and its corresponding medical facility were named after him in 2004. In Richard Wagner's Lohengrin a certain \\"Radbod, ruler of the Frisians\\" is mentioned as Ortrud's father. It is possible that Wagner was thinking of the historical Redbad, although he died more than 150 years before the birth of Henry the Fowler, another character in the opera, who could not, therefore, be contemporary of Redbad's daughter. In Harry Harrison's The Hammer and the Cross series of novels, Redbad becomes the founder of \\"the Way\\", an organized pagan cult, created to combat the efforts of Christian missionaries. Black metal band Ophidian Forest recorded a concept album Redbad in 2007. Dutch folk metal band 'Heidevolk' recorded a song 'Koning Radboud' (King Redbad) on their 2008 album 'Walhalla Wacht' singing about the legend of Wulfram and Redbad. In 2015 the Frisian Folk-Metal band Baldrs Draumar released a full album on the life and deeds of king Redbad called Aldgillessoan. It is based on the book R√™db√¢d, Kronyk fan in Kening (Chronicles of a King) by Willem Schoorstra. In 2018, Dutch production company Farmhouse released a film, Redbad, based on the historical Redbad. It is directed by Roel Rein√© and stars Jonathan Banks and S√∏ren Malling alongside a variety of Dutch actors.

It is located in Reykjav√≠k. The school traces its origin to 1056, when a school was established in Sk√°lholt, and it remains one of the oldest institutions in Iceland. The school was moved to Reykjav√≠k in 1786, but poor housing conditions forced it to move again in 1805 to Bessasta√∞ir near Reykjav√≠k. In 1846 the school was moved to its current location, and a new building was erected for it in Reykjav√≠k. This was the largest building in the country at the time and can be seen on the 500 Icelandic krona bill. It was used initially when Althing began to meet again in Reykjav√≠k after a few years hiatus and thus it is in this building where Icelandic independence leader J√≥n Sigur√∞sson led the MPs in their famous phrase, \\"V√©r m√≥tm√¶lum allir\\". The school has previously been known as \\"L√¶r√∞i sk√≥linn\\" (The Learned School), \\"Lat√≠nusk√≥linn\\" (The Latin School) and by the Latin title \\"Schola Reykjavicensis\\"; it received its present name in 1937. Menntask√≥linn √≠ Reykjav√≠k offers a three-year course of study. It usually ends with a degree (st√∫dentspr√≥f) which gives the graduating student the right to advance to an Icelandic university. Many Icelandic politicians, including the first prime minister Hannes Hafstein, former Prime Minister Dav√≠√∞ Oddsson, former President of Iceland, √ìlafur Ragnar Gr√≠msson and current president, Gu√∞ni Th. J√≥hannesson all attended MR. Almost every Prime Minister of Iceland has been educated at the school apart from Halld√≥r √Åsgr√≠msson, √ìlafur J√≥hannesson, Sigur√∞ur Ingi J√≥hannsson, √ûorsteinn P√°lsson and Katr√≠n Jakobsd√≥ttir. Geir H. Haarde, Dav√≠√∞'s successor as chairman of the Independence Party and former Prime Minister, also took over from him as chairman of student body, Sk√≥laf√©lagi√∞ (\\"inspector scholae\\"). In 1879 Hannes Hafstein was the school's first inspector scholae, and in 1940 his grandson Einar Ragnarsson Kvaran achieved the position. The former President of Iceland, √ìlafur Ragnar Gr√≠msson, was also the president of the main student body, Framt√≠√∞in. Culture and traditions School traditions include a hall fight and the singing of the Brevitate Vitae. Six dances are held every year, including the costume-ball and the freshman-ball. Many clubs have been founded in MR, these include: An Art club (with five divisions for: Visual art, music, dancing, literature and films), Herran√≥tt acting guild (the oldest theatric club in northern Europe), Computer academy and a Nerd club (which merged and became known as The Academy), Traveller's club, Sport's club, Riding club, Science club, Novelist club, Chess club and the Rowing club (which was historically a club for rowing, but is now a male/female-cheerleading team). =The Hall Fight= Every year at the end of spring semester the students of MR organize a fight in the halls of the main building. A bell is placed on the ground floor of the building and the seniors aim to reach that bell and ring it while other students try to fight them and prevent them from doing so. Should the seniors succeed in their task, the younger students are to attend next class. During the fight, some or all senior students are covered in dirt. This event was cancelled permanently after the 2008-2009 Inspector Platearum (a senior student who is responsible for ringing the school bells and is furthermore the leader of the seniors in the Hall Fight) broke his neck in the fight, resulting in a 9 million ISK lawsuit. =The Freshmen Day= One day in the first weeks of school is a special day for newcomers (Icelandic: busadagur), this day is held in all junior colleges in the country and is not only the tradition of Menntask√≥linn √≠ Reykjav√≠k, although the traditions regarding this day vary greatly between schools. The day starts with the seniors dressing up in white toga cloaks and painting their faces. The seniors then march around the school and gather the newcomers out to the school grounds where they then thrown high into the air. The tradition of throwing newcomers into the air is old - but the part of dressing up in toga was added by seniors in 1991 (graduating in 1992). On this day (and the next few days after) students tend to sing the song \\"De Brevitate Vitae.\\" The following night a freshmen ball is held. =The Violin Dance (Fi√∞luballi√∞)= The violin dance is by many described as a fancy promenade ball where live violin music is played and students wear their best garments while dancing elegantly. The tradition was started in the 1960s and was meant to be an iconoclasm to the hippie culture at the time. Reverend Geir Waage is rumored to have been the originator of the dance. It was only held once, although in 1992 it was resurrected by Dagur B. Eggertsson, inspector scholae. It is now an annual event for graduating students. =Publications= The two student bodies maintain a number of periodic publications. Amongst them are: * Sk√≥labla√∞i√∞ Skinfaxi - Articles about the past year; published annually. Contains two publications, Sk√≥labla√∞i√∞ and Skinfaxi, respectably, which have been published jointly since 2009. Skinfaxi was first published in 1898 and Sk√≥labla√∞i√∞ in 1925. * Loki Laufeyjarson - A similar publication to Menntask√≥lat√≠√∞indi, but published by Framt√≠√∞in, the student body. * Menntask√≥lat√≠√∞indi - A newspaper about daily life and events in the school; published roughly once every month by the new student body Sk√≥laf√©lagi√∞. * De Rerum Natura - A scientific magazine published by the science club every year. Named after Lucretius' De Rerum Natura. It was first published in 1960, under the presidency of √ìlafur Ragnar Gr√≠msson, who later became president of Iceland. * Yggdrasill & The Novelist News - Two magazines published by the Novelist club every year. * Vetur - An annual photographic newspaper with pictures of students, daily life and social life in MR. * Businn - A monthly newspaper for freshmen, written by juniors for juniors. * Idus Martii - An annual magazine about history, ancient languages and classics. Published by 3rd year students of the classical language department on the Ides of March. * Morkinskinna - Published annually in the beginning of autumn. A handbook containing information about the school and its students and a study diary. Named after Morkinskinna. =Debating= Framt√≠√∞in, the oldest student body in Iceland, is a member of M√¶lsku- og r√∂kr√¶√∞ukeppni framhaldssk√≥la √° √çslandi (Morf√çs, The Icelandic Junior College Debating Society), which holds an annual debating competition between Icelandic junior colleges. Since its foundation in 1983, MR has won the finals eight times. The students of MR regularly hold debating competitions among themselves. These competitions are held very often and a lot of traditions have evolved around them. \\"Framt√≠√∞in\\" administers the debating society for MR students and it is also one of the oldest clubs in Iceland (founded in 1883). S√≥lbjartur is an annual debating competition in which each class of MR is free to send one or more teams to debate. The winning team receives the title \\"S√≥lbjartur\\" (Literally: Sun-bright) and the best debater of the winning team receives the title \\"Orator Scholae\\" (Latin: Spokesman of the school). Another annual competition is held, called \\"Orator Minor\\" (Latin: The next-best spokesman). Orator Minor is a competition where people debate about randomly selected subjects in one-on-one battles and only have ten minutes to prepare their speeches. However, Orator Minor, from the year 2007, is held more than once every year, even up to five times. =Quizzing= MR is greatly renowned for its excellent results in Gettu betur, an annual quiz show for gymnasiums on the Icelandic national television. MR has won the quiz show 21 times out of 33, including an eleven-times winning streak 1993‚Äì2003. MR's last victory was in 2020. An annual quiz competition is held, for which each class sends in one or more teams to compete against others. This competition is called \\"Ratatoskur\\", named after the famous squirrel from Nordic mythology. =MR- v√≠= One day in October each year, the students of MR and its rival school, Verzlunarsk√≥li √çslands (Commercial College of Iceland) or \\"Verzlo\\" as it is often referred to as, meet in the \\"Hlj√≥msk√°lagar√∞ur\\" park, located in downtown Reykjav√≠k, where various games and competitions are held. These include: sprinting, soccer, rowing, giant-chess (later replaced with ordinary chess), screaming, tug-o-war, competitive eating, arm wrestling, car stuffing and the infamous Mexican-run. The night of that day, a debating competition between the two schools is held. The Menntask√≥li in Reykjavik.  Education  MR is renowned for its traditional and classical style of education. MR offers two separate \\"paths\\" which students choose when enrolling in the school. These are a natural science path and a language path. The natural science path divides into a biology department and a physics department on the second year, while the language path divides into modern language department and a classical language department. MR is the only school in Iceland which teaches mandatory Latin in some form and the only one which teaches Ancient Greek. In earlier years the school offered a six years course of study before it was shortened into four years. Thus the first year is called \\"third form\\", the second year is called \\"fourth form\\" and so on. However, in 2016 the school was shortened even more to only three years, with the first three-years graduates graduating May 2019 along with the last round of graduates in the four years system. Housing The number of students has grown rapidly since the founding of the school. This has led to the expanding of the school's housing. The flagship and main building of the school is still the front house, Gamli Sk√≥li (literally: The Old School), which was built in 1846. Several houses and additions have been built since. These buildings include: * √ç√æaka (Ithaca) is the library and study hall of MR. It was built in 1867 as a gift to Icelanders from Charles Kelsall, a wealthy English merchant. It takes its name from Ithaca, New York, the home of professor Willard Fiske that started a book club at the school. The ground floor is a reading hall and an historical archive. The upper floor is the oldest library in Iceland. * Fj√≥si√∞ (The Cowshed) is a small wooden house with two classrooms. It was originally used to store fire- fighting equipment and later used to house the rector's cows. * √ç√ær√≥ttah√∂llin (The Sports-Palace) is the oldest sports hall in Iceland and for a long time it was the biggest one, although it is thought to be very small and outdated by today's standards. In fact it is so small that the basketball penalty boxes overlap. * √ûr√¶lakistan (The Sweatshop) is a very small building connected to the Sports-Palace. It is a small gym and currently contains modern weight- lifting equipment but has historically contained antiquated equipment. * Casa Christi (Latin: House of Christ) is an old building with several classrooms. It is relatively big compared to other houses in the area. This building was once used by the Reykjav√≠k YMCA, thus the name \\"Casa Christi\\". It is thought to be ugly and in bad condition and has been noted by the students and faculty as smelling distinctly of chlorine. The building is due for demolition in the near future for a new and better building to be constructed. A movement within the school has surfaced, demanding a change of name for this building. One suggestion is \\"Casa Sophiae\\", (Greek: House of Wisdom), which reflects how the nation is becoming more and more secular. * Casa Nova (Latin: New House) is a relatively young building and the largest one in the complex. It has many classrooms and is also the center for the students' social gatherings. A comfort lounge and a cafeteria is located in the basement of the building. It was originally built in the 1960s but underwent major restoration in 2006. * Villa Nova (Latin: New Apartment) is the groundskeeper's shed and a storage room for the school. It also used to house the offices of the student bodies before Amtmannsst√≠gur 2 was taken into service. * El√≠sabetarh√∫s (Elizabeth's House) also known as \\"Minni El√≠sabetar\\" (Memoirs of Elizabeth) is the latest addition to the school's housing. It has several classrooms, including some of the most perfect educational laboratories in Iceland. Known as Casa Subuculae before it was fully taken into service. It was a gift from the former owner of the house, whose wife, El√≠sabet, had recently died. * Amtmannsst√≠gur 2 is the teachers' lounge. It also houses offices and serves as a meeting place for the student bodies. * Menntask√≥laseli√∞ or simply seli√∞, built 1938, is a house little outside of Reykjav√≠k (around 45 minutes), close to the southern town of Hverager√∞i. It is a rural dwelling used for student trips and vacations. It was used for the first time in ten years in 2011 after having been closed due to its bad state. Since then it has been used extensively by the school's choir, and a geology trip for the freshmen once per year.

Population figures: In its heyday, Zelenogradsk (as Cranz) was a popular seaside resort on Germany's eastern Baltic coast, comparable to Bognor Regis in England. However, at the end of World War II, the Soviets took over the town, and much of its tourist traffic has been diverted to nearby Svetlogorsk, formerly called Rauschen. History The site of today's Zelenogradsk was originally an Old Prussian fishing village, in the proximity of Kaup, a Prussian town on the coast of the Baltic Sea in the Viking era. The area became controlled by the Teutonic Order and settled with Germans. The German name Cranz, originally Cranzkuhren, derives from the Old Prussian word krantas, meaning \\"the coast\\". For most of its history, it remained a small village in East Prussia. 1890‚Äì1905 postcard of Cranz with the Ladies Bath During the 19th century, Cranz became the primary seaside resort for the Kingdom of Prussia on the East Prussian coastline, especially after the construction of a railway line connecting it with K√∂nigsberg (now Kaliningrad) in 1885. From 1816 to 1895, it was known as das k√∂nigliche Bad, or \\"the royal bathing resort\\". Despite the increasing numbers of tourists, the fishing industry remained strong; smoked flounder was a regional delicacy. Although Cranz had over 6,000 inhabitants by the start of World War II, it never received a town charter. The area was overrun by the Soviet Red Army during World War II and annexed to the Russian SFSR, although it suffered minimally through warfare. The German population fled during the evacuation of East Prussia or was subsequently expelled by force. Cranz was renamed Zelenogradsk in 1946 and was granted town status in the subsequent years. Administrative and municipal status Within the framework of administrative divisions, Zelenogradsk serves as the administrative center of Zelenogradsky District.Resolution #640 As an administrative division, it is incorporated within Zelenogradsky District as the town of district significance of Zelenogradsk. Within the framework of municipal divisions, since May 15, 2015, the territories of the town of district significance of Zelenogradsk and of four rural okrugs of Zelenogradsky District are incorporated as Zelenogradsky Urban Okrug.Law #420 Before that, the town of district significance was incorporated within Zelenogradsky Municipal District as Zelenogradskoye Urban Settlement. Tourism The tourism industry was neglected during the Cold War and Zelenogradsk's tourism primacy was relinquished to nearby Svetlogorsk (formerly Rauschen). This policy changed in recent years. Zelenogradsk is becoming more popular with Russian vacationers, and many rich Russians own private houses in the area.

Population figures: History Svetlogorsk is situated in the historical region of Sambia of East Prussia. It was established in 1258 as a Sambian fishermen settlement named Ruse-moter (lit. region of cellars). The Teutonic Order that conquered the land gradually corrupted the name into Rause-moter, Raushe-moter, and finally Rauschen. Rauschen water tower In the early 19th century, the place became fashionable among German vacationers. On June 24, 1820, it was officially recognized as a spa town. During his visit to Rauschen in 1840, King Frederick William IV of Prussia ordered the sea embankment to be beautified. The arrival of the K√∂nigsberg railway in 1900 boosted the resort's popularity. A cable railway and a racecourse were constructed in Rauschen before World War I. Otto Nicolai and Thomas Mann were among the celebrities who stayed there. In 14 April 1945, Rauschen was conquered by the Soviet Union in the course of World War II. It became a part of Kaliningrad Oblast and in 17 June 1947 was given its present name. Today, it is a moderately popular summer resort town thanks to its beachfront and many spas, clubs, and attractions. It has arguably the best preserved Prussian heritage and architecture amongst former Soviet towns that were once Prussian and survived the destruction of Konigsberg and other settlements from WWII.

It won the Nebula Award, Hugo Award and John W. Campbell Memorial Award in 1998. Plot Though its title is similar to The Forever War and both novels deal with soldiers in the future, Forever Peace is not a direct sequel, and takes place on a different future of Earth in the year 2048. Using remotely controlled robots called \\"soldierboys\\" (which are nearly invincible), the Alliance military fights third world guerrillas in an endless series of economy-driven wars. As only first world nations possess the nanoforge technology that can produce anything from basic materials, conflict is largely asymmetric. The novel is told partly in first-person narration by the main character, Julian Class, and partly by an anonymous third-person narrator, who is able to comment on aspects of Julian's personality and background. The main protagonist, Julian Class, is a physicist and a mechanic who operates a soldierboy. Thanks to electronic \\"jacks\\" implanted in their skulls, mechanics are remotely linked to the machinery as well as to each other, being able to experience battle through the machines and read the thoughts of other mechanics who are simultaneously jacked in. After attempting suicide, Julian and his lover, Amelia \\"Blaze\\" Harding, are made aware of a problem with an automated particle physics project that could potentially trigger a new Big Bang that destroys the Earth and the rest of the universe. Because it's so easy to do, it is speculated that universes could potentially have only the lifespan of the first civilization that attempts such a project. When Julian, Blaze, and another physicist submit their paper to a journal's review board, they find themselves the target of \\"The Hammer of God\\", a Christian cult bent on hastening an anticipated end of the universe. As the Hammer of God has a secret presence throughout the government, Julian and Blaze narrowly miss being assassinated. Marty Larrin, one of the inventors of jacking technology, recruits Julian and Blaze in an attempt to use the technology to end war for all time; a little-known secret is that jacking with someone else for a long enough period (about two weeks) will psychologically eliminate the ability to kill another human being. By \\"humanizing\\" the entire world, dangerous technology would not be a problem for human survival. They do so, stop the particle accelerator's construction, and the war is eventually ended.

However, the rising popularity of the Internet has changed how campaigns talk to voters, and also how campaigns maintain communications between staff members, volunteers and political consultants, and getting the campaign message out via the web, e-mail and interactive web forms. Campaigns are also utilizing an increasing number of tools that assist with accounting, contact management, and handling increasingly complicated government regulations. The exact best implementation of these sort of tools is under debate. Politicians in many states have started websites and weblogs (or \\"blogs\\") with a variety of degrees of success. Social software has been used to benefit politicians. However, at the same time, companies are offering tools that push the edge of social responsibility, including Spamming. Other companies pretending to be legitimate polling agencies, attempt to influence voters through leading questions, in so called \\"push polls\\". Some of the tools are those which enable the formation of local groups. These rapidly forming groups give citizens the confidence that they are not alone, and inspire collective actions. As Reed's law predicted, tools that enable group formations at the edges of the network (Edge Tools), deliver measurable value, as can be seen by the use of Meetup and Get Local on the Howard Dean campaign. While many activists and technologists see great value in these tools, many campaign professionals fear the loss of control. The value of these tools to campaigns below the Presidential level also remains uncertain. Other kinds of internet tools for campaign management do not have such specific methods of organizing people. There is an increasing number of companies providing web- based software to replace database systems that require a specific computer or network. By making databases for GOTV/voter tracking, fundraising, accounting and campaign management accessible from any location, these vendors are allowing campaigns to take advantage of resources that many individual volunteers and campaign staff have available at home, expanding the use of distributed campaigning techniques.

Williams also employs a large cast of characters including many famous literary characters who appear in dream sequences. They include Don Quixote and his partner Sancho, Marguerite \\"Camille\\" Gautier (see The Lady of the Camellias), Casanova, Lord Byron, and Esmeralda (see The Hunchback of Notre Dame), and others. Taking place in the main plaza, the play goes through a series of confusing and almost logic-defying events, including the revival of the Gypsy's daughter (Esmeralda)'s virginity and then the loss of it again. A main theme that the play deals with is coming to terms with the thought of growing older and possibly becoming irrelevant.  Production history  = Premiere = Camino Real was originated from a Williams's one-act play, Ten Blocks on the Camino Real. This series of 10 scenes, or \\"blocks\\", was first staged in a workshop by Elia Kazan at the Actors Studio in 1949, and later turned into a 1953 Broadway production directed by Kazan with assistance by Anna Sokolow and starring Eli Wallach (as Kilroy), Frank Silvera (as Gutman), Joseph Anthony (as Casanova), Jo Van Fleet (as Marguerite \\"Camille\\" Gautier), Jennie Goldstein (as the Gypsy), Barbara Baxley (as Esmeralda), and David J. Stewart (as the Baron). With only 60 performances on Broadway, the play was not a mainstream success. Brooks Atkinson of The New York Times called it \\"a strange and disturbing drama,\\" which seemed to be \\"a dark mirror\\" of \\"Mr. Williams's concept of life ‚Äî full of black and appalling images.\\" Director Elia Kazan later wrote in his memoirs that he had misinterpreted the play by infusing it with excessive naturalism. = London Premiere = The first London production opened on April 8th, 1957 at the Phoenix Theatre. It starred Denholm Elliott as Kilroy, Diana Wynyard as Marguerite, was directed by Peter Hall and played for two months. = Revivals = Camino Real was presented on television in 1966 by NET, a PBS predecessor, as Ten Blocks on the Camino Real. A black-and-white production, it was directed by Jack Landau and starred Martin Sheen, Lotte Lenya, Tom Aldredge, Michael Baseleon, Albert Dekker, and Hurd Hatfield. In 1968, the Los Angeles Mark Taper Forum revived the play with Earl Holliman as Kilroy. In January 1970, the play enjoyed its first Broadway revival at the Vivian Beaumont Theater at Lincoln Center, directed by Jules Irving and starring Al Pacino (Kilroy), Victor Buono (Gutman), Patrick McVey (Don Quixote), Jean-Pierre Aumont (Casanova), Jessica Tandy (Camille), Sylvia Syms (the Gypsy), David J. Stewart (the Baron), Susan Tyrrell (Esmeralda), and Clifford David (Lord Byron). In his review for The New York Times, critic Clive Barnes wrote \\"there are people who think that Camino Real was Tennessee Williams's best play, and I believe that they are right. It is a play that seems to have been torn out of a human soul, a tale told by an idiot signifying a great deal of suffering and a great deal of gallantry.\\" The UK's Royal Shakespeare Company revived the play at the Swan Theatre in 1996. The production was directed by Steven Pimlott, and starred Leslie Phillips as Gutman, Peter Egan as Casanova and Susannah York as Camille. In June 1999, Nicholas Martin staged a production at the Williamstown Theater Festival, featuring Ethan Hawke (Kilroy), Jeffrey Jones (Gutman), Richard Easton (Casanova), Blair Brown (Marguerite Gautier), Christian Camargo (Baron de Charlus and Lord Byron), Hope Davis (Esmeralda), Kristine Nielsen (The Gypsy), and John Seidman (Lord Mulligan and Don Quixote). Reviewing the production in the New York Times, Ben Brantley wrote that \\"... in his art as in his life, Williams could be grotesquely excessive and sloppy. But whatever he wrote, he tore it straight from his soul, and in this age of irony there is something especially nourishing in such sustained depths of emotion.\\" In October 1999, Michael Wilson mounted another revival at the Hartford Stage, with a cast including James Colby (Kilroy), Helmar Augustus Cooper (Gutman), Rip Torn (Casanova), Betty Buckley (Marguerite Gautier), Novella Nelson (Gypsy), Lisa Leguillou (Esmeralda), John Feltch (Baron de Charlus, Lord Byron and Don Quixote), Natalie Brown (Lady Mulligan) and Nafe Katter (Lord Mulligan). In January 2009, director David Herskovits staged a new production at the Ohio Theater in Manhattan. This short version, which focused on Kilroy as the American boxer (played by Satya Bhabha), was a re-imagination of the original one-act play Ten Blocks on the Camino Real. From March 3 to April 8, 2012, the Goodman Theatre in Chicago presented a new version by director Calixto Bieito and playwright Marc Rosich.

Michener. Like other Michener titles, Alaska spans a considerable amount of time, traced through the gradual interlinking of several families. Plot introduction Alaska is 868 pages long. Along with the reading, Michener provides a table of contents, a list of acknowledgements, and a Fact and Fiction section. The third item offers the reader an insight into what occurred in real life and what the author invented. Plot summary =Chapter I: The Clashing Terranes= A sweeping description of the formation of the North American continent. The reader follows the development of the Alaskan terrain over millennia. The city of Los Angeles is now some twenty-four hundred miles south of central Alaska, and since it is moving slowly northward as the San Andreas fault slides irresistibly along, the city is destined eventually to become part of Alaska. If the movement is two inches a year, which it often is, we can expect Los Angeles to arrive off Anchorage in about seventy-six million years. =Chapter II: The Ice Castle= The plot of this chapter follows the mastodons, sabre- toothed tigers and woolly mammoths as they make their way into Alaska via the land bridge. First, the animals are discussed in general terms. Then, in the second half of the chapter, the reader learns about a specific mammoth named Mastodon, and another named Matriarch. The plot follows Matriarch and her family, as they encounter man for the first time. =Chapter III: People of the North= About some of the early Eskimos, particularly a man named Oogruk and his family. The chapter details the hunting of a whale as well as the beginning of hunting sea otters for fur by the Russians. =Chapter IV: The Explorers= This chapter tells of the early exploration of Alaska along with Russia's first encounters with the native peoples, including the brutal slaughter of many native people and sea otters. =Chapter V: The Duel= The duel referred to in the chapter's title is the one between the shamanism of the native people and the Christianity of the Russian settlers. After the men from one tribe are taken away to aid in hunting, the women and babies are left to fend for themselves. They learn to pilot kayaks, something that had been forbidden to them, and ultimately harpoon a small whale to ensure their survival. After the Russians return, a girl named Cidaq is \\"purchased\\" and taken to Kodiak Island, but not before she is brutally abused by one sailor in particular. On Kodiak, she consults with a shaman and his mummy and decides to seek revenge upon this man by converting to Christianity to marry him when he returns to Kodiak, believing that she can humiliate him by refusing to marry him at the last moment. However, she goes through with the wedding and becomes a battered wife. A priest on Kodiak falls in love with her, and after her husband is killed by a great tidal wave, Cidaq (rechristened Sofia) marries the priest, who changes his relationship with the church to become the kind of priest who can marry. At the end of the chapter, Michener states that Christianity won over shamanism, but in the process, the population of native people dwindled from more than 18,000 to fewer than 1,200. =Chapter VI: Lost Worlds= This chapter further details the clashes between the Native people and the Russians, most specifically the Battle of Sitka. The events are shown through the eyes of a native named Raven-heart and an Arkady Voronov, the son of Father Vornov and Sofia Kuchovskaya (formerly Cidaq). Arkady Voronov marries a Russian woman who moves to Alaska, and together they navigate the Yukon River. The chapter also explains the death of Alexander Baranov and ends with the purchase of Alaska by the United States of America. =Chapter VII: Giants in Chaos= This chapter shows the clash between two rival ship captains, Captains Schransky and Michael A. Healy. Meanwhile, Reverend Sheldon Jackson, a missionary, travels to Alaska to further establish it as a state, with the help of Senator Benjamin Harrison. He sets about establishing Christian missions of various denominations to further spread Christianity to the native people of Alaska. =Chapter VIII: Gold= The eighth chapter tells of the chaos surrounding the Alaskan gold rush using the fictitious Venn family and a prospector named John Klope. It mentions the real character of Soapy Smith and his fatal duel with Frank H. Reid. It also details the hardships of crossing the Chilkoot Pass. =Chapter IX: The Golden Beaches of Nome= Gold is discovered in Nome, and Tom Venn and his stepmother Missy pick up their stakes and move there. Tom is appointed manager of a branch of Ross and Raglan, a store that sells food and outdoor supplies. Missy's boyfriend Matt Murphy joins Tom and Missy in Nome, arriving there via bicycle. Although these characters are fictitious, the bike trip is based on the real bike trek of Max R. Hirshberg in 1900, and the troubles of gold mine thieving with judicial collusion is based upon the politician Alexander McKenzie and Judge Arthur H. Noyes. =Chapter X: Salmon= This chapter describes the formation and operation of a fictional company's cannery (an Alaskan first) on the Taku Inlet when Ross and Raglan appoint Tom Venn to be in charge of the cannery, the fishing and the Chinese laborers. Along the way, the company clashes with local members of the Tlingit tribe, whose fishing rights are being encroached upon. Tom begins on-and-off romances with two girls; one is Lydia Ross, the daughter of the owner of Ross and Raglan, and the other is Nancy Bigears, the daughter of a local Tlingit of whom Tom is very fond. Nancy Bigears, knows the romance cannot continue because Tom Venn is unable to comprehend the fishing rights and salmon conservancy issues created by his cannery. Nancy Bigears father, who lived across the inlet from the cannery is now prohibited from fishing on his ancestral lands. At the end of the chapter, the reader learns that Tom marries Lydia, and that Nancy marries Ah Ting, a Chinese man who was once employed as a foreman at the salmon cannery before striking out on his own. =Chapter XI: The Railbelt= In 1919, a government official arrives in a small town of Minnesota made up of immigrants of Swedish and Finnish descent, as well as those who have been in the United States for several generations. He recruits a group of families to move to Alaska and settle in the Matanuska Valley, where they will be provided with land that they will not begin to pay on for at least three years, as long as they promise to farm. This chapter follows the Flatch family closely, especially the children. LeRoy Flatch grows up to become a bush pilot and Flossie is an animal lover who falls in love with a local \\"half-breed\\" man of white and Eskimo descent. =Chapter XII: The Rim of Fire= In a typical James Michener fashion, the final chapter is an interaction between various characters in preceding chapter or their descendants. Alaska is in the process of applying for statehood. Missy remains on the side advocating for statehood, while Tom Venn petitioned to keep Alaska a territory and under Seattle business control. In the end President Dwight D. Eisenhower signs the Alaska Statehood Act, making Alaska the 49th state of the Union.

Slussen in 1936 Locks in operation, April 2009 Destruction of the area's main features began in 2015 when the famous oval- shaped Kolingsborg building was levelled. Slussenomr√•det (, the Sluice area) is an area of central Stockholm, on the S√∂derstr√∂m river connecting S√∂dermalm and Gamla stan. The area is named after the locks between Lake M√§laren and the Baltic Sea. Called Karl Johanslussen, the locks themselves allow passage between these two bodies of water (of different levels). Slussen also refers to the cloverleaf interchange and associated pedestrian passages and walkways opened on 15 October 1935. The Slussen metro station is a hub of public transport in Stockholm, serving the red and green lines of the Stockholm Metro, with an adjoining bus terminal and Saltsj√∂banan commuter rail station serving the eastern parts of Stockholm and its surroundings. The Djurg√•rden ferry departs adjacently. History It is unclear exactly when the channel at Slussen was created, but in the centuries up to the 17th century the differences in level between the Lake M√§laren with the Baltic Sea made it increasingly difficult to pass through the S√∂derstr√∂m channel. The first lock was built here in 1642, Queen Christina's Lock. By the early 1700s the lock proved too small and in 1751 the Christopher Polhem Lock was completed. In 1850 an even larger lock was completed, the Nils Ericson lock. In the 1860s rail traffic started crossing the locks and in the ensuing decades more and more wagon and carriage traffic, as well as pedestrians, crossed the lock between Gamla Stan and the S√∂dermalm suburb. Various plans to improve the traffic situation were drawn up between 1895 and 1919. With the arrival of the automobile, by the 1920s, the traffic situation was being called \\"Slussen Misery\\" (slussenel√§ndet) in the press. In 1930 a committee was appointed with the task of solving this and other city traffic problems. (See article in Swedish Wikipedia) In 1931 a total overhaul of Slussen was funded. Buildings were demolished, a new Karl-Johan Lock was built, and a cloverleaf interchange was built. Pedestrian tunnels and walkways were built on three different levels. The project was praised by Le Corbusier as \\"the modern era's first large project\\". Political plans for reshaping the area began in the 1970s. A vigorous discussion in Swedish media followed with some arguing that Slussen was a unique historic example of traffic engineering and thus should be preserved, while others argued that many of the original design features were either no longer needed due to other traffic relief projects such as tunnels that had been completed over the previous few decades, or were unusable due to physical deterioration of the structure. After conducting a competition, in May 2009 the city of Stockholm announced that the firm of Norman Foster had been selected to create a new master plan of the Slussen area. The design of Foster and Partners features two linked pedestrian bridges and one for traffic. It removes many of the existing roads and creates several new blocks of buildings in proximity to the waterfront. The interchange was closed in 2016 and the demolition of the present structure started. The area will be a construction site for the next eight to ten years. = Galleries = File:Slussen 1642.jpgQueen Christina's Lock, 1642 File:Polhems sluss Anders Holm 1780.jpgChristopher Polhems Lock, 1755, after heavy spring runoff.

The practice was first used by Ancient Rome and is still most commonly associated with the Romans, but it was also adopted as a practice by many later empires, especially the French, British and Russian Empires. Roman victory titles Victory titles were suffixed to the commander's name and were usually the name of the enemy defeated by the commander. Some victory titles became hereditary cognomina, while others were personal agnomina and not carried on by later family members. Names like Africanus (\\"the African\\"), Numidicus (\\"the Numidian\\"), Isauricus (\\"the Isaurian\\"), Creticus (\\"the Cretan\\"), Gothicus (\\"the Goth\\"), Germanicus (\\"the German\\") and Parthicus (\\"the Parthian\\") expressed the triumphal subjugation of these peoples or their territories, or commemorated the locations of general's successful campaigns, equivalent to modern titles like Lawrence of Arabia, and were not indicators of origin. The practice of awarding victory titles was established in the Roman Republic. The most famous grantee of Republican victory title was Publius Cornelius Scipio, who for his great victories in the Second Punic War, specifically the Battle of Zama was awarded by the Roman Senate the title \\"Africanus\\" and is thus known to history as \\"Scipio Africanus\\" (his adopted grandson Scipio Aemilianus Africanus was awarded the same title after the Third Punic War and is known as \\"Scipio Africanus the Younger\\"). Other notable holders of such victory titles include Quintus Caecilius Metellus Numidicus, who was replaced by Gaius Marius in command-in-chief of the Jugurthine War; Publius Servilius Vatia Isauricus, who commanded Roman anti-pirate operations in the eastern Mediterranean (and was father of Julius Caesar's colleague in his second consulate); Publius Servilius Vatia Isauricus in 48 BC), while Marcus Antonius Creticus, another anti-piracy commander, (and father of Caesar's magister equitum, Mark Antony) actually lost in Crete and was called Creticus mockingly, as it also meant \\"Man made of Chalk\\". Marcus Porcius Cato \\"Uticensis\\" received his title posthumously from those glorifying his suicide, rather than defeat at, Utica. The practice continued in the Roman Empire, although it was subsequently amended by some Roman Emperors who desired to emphasise the totality of their victories by adding Maximus (\\"the Greatest\\") to the victory title (e.g., Parthicus Maximus, \\"the Greatest Parthian\\"). This taste grew to be rather vulgar by modern standards, with increasingly grandiose accumulations of partially fictitious victory titles. In a broader sense, the term victory title is sometimes used to describe the repeatable awarding of the invariable style of Imperator (Greek equivalent Autokrator; see those articles), which is the highest military qualification (as modern states have awarded a non- operational highest rank, sometimes instituted for a particular general), but even when it marks the recipient out for one or more memorable victories (and the other use, as a permanent military command for the ruler, became in fact the more significant one), it does not actually specify one. Medieval victory titles After the fall of Rome, the practice continued in modified form. * Charlemagne, the first Carolingian emperor of the Franks, styled himself Dominator Saxonorum (\\"Dominator of the Saxons\\") after subduing by force the last major pagan people in the empire * Byzantine Emperor Basil II (r. 960‚Äì1025) ‚Äî \\"the Bulgar-slayer\\" * King Richard I of England (r. 1189‚Äì1199) ‚Äî \\"the Lionheart\\" * King Edward I of England (r. 1272‚Äì1307) ‚Äî \\"Hammer of the Scots\\" * King Afonso IV of Portugal (r. 1325‚Äì1357) ‚Äî \\"the Brave\\" for his victory in the Battle of Rio Salado * Ruler of Epirus Thomas Preljuboviƒá (r. 1367‚Äì1384) ‚Äî \\"the Albanian-slayer\\" * Prince Alexander Yaroslavich of Novgorod was called Alexander Nevsky for his victory in the Battle of Neva. * Prince Dmitry of Moscow was styled Dmitry Donskoy for his victory over Mamai Khan at Kulikovo on the Don. Modern victory titles The term \\"victory-title\\" occurs in English from as early as 1938. Modern monarchs awarded titles in commemoration of major military victories, but in the guise of a feudal aristocratic title, often hereditary, but only in appearance: an actual fief was not required, indeed they often were granted in chief of a battlefield where the awarding monarch simply had no constitutional authority to grant anything validly under local law. This new form was even more specific than the Roman practice. Instead of naming the enemy ‚Äî which could well need to be repeated ‚Äî it linked the name of a battle, which was almost always unique. A further level of protection was available by naming a nearby place, such as 'Austerlitz' which Napoleon declared sounded better than the alternative. =Russian Empire= In the Russian Empire, many victory titles originated in the period between the accession of Catherine the Great (1762) and the death of Nicholas I of Russia (1855). But as early as 1707, after Alexander Menshikov occupied Swedish Ingria (Izhora) during the Great Northern War, Peter I of Russia officially designated him Duke or Prince of Ingria ( - gertsog Izhorsky). Other Russian victory titles (sometimes referencing whole campaigns rather than specific battles) include: * 1775 ‚Äî Chesmensky (\\"Chesmean\\") for Count Aleksey Orlov for his victory in the naval Battle of Chesma * 1775 ‚Äî Zadunaisky (\\"Transdanubian\\") for Count Pyotr Rumyantsev for his crossing the Danube during the Russo-Turkish War, 1768-1774 * 1775 ‚Äî Krymsky (\\"Crimean\\") for Prince Vasily Mikhailovich Dolgorukov for his victories in the Crimea during the Russo-Turkish War (1768‚Äì74) * 1783 ‚Äî His Serene Highness Prince Tavrichesky for Grigori Potemkin for his annexation of the Crimea and New Russia (the ancient Greeks called this area Taurida; see also Tauride Palace) * 1789 ‚Äî Rymniksky for Alexander Suvorov for his victory in the Battle of Rymnik (Russo-Turkish War (1787‚Äì92)) * 1799 ‚Äî Prince Italiysky (\\"Italian\\") for Suvorov, for the Italian Campaign of 1799 * 1813 ‚Äî His Serene Highness Prince Smolensky for Mikhail Kutuzov for his 1812 defeat of Napoleon at Krasnoi near Smolensk during Napoleon's invasion of Russia * 1827 ‚Äî Count Erivansky for Ivan Paskevich for his capture of Erivan (Yerevan) in Armenia during the Russo-Persian War, 1826-1828 * 1829 ‚Äî Zabalkansky (\\"Transbalkan\\") for Count Ivan Dibich for having crossed the Balkan Mountains during the Russo-Turkish War, 1828-1829 * 1831 ‚Äî His Serene Highness Prince Varshavsky (\\"Varsovian\\") for Paskevich for having taken Warsaw during the Polish November Uprising of 1830-1831 * 1855 ‚Äî Karssky for Count Nicholas Muravyov for his capture of Kars after the Siege of Kars Furthermore, similar titles were awarded for comparable non-military services to the empire, e.g. in 1858 ‚Äî Amursky for another Nicholas Muravyov, who had negotiated a new border between Russian and China along the Amur River under the Treaty of Aigun. General Wrangel awarded the last victory-title in Russia (Krymsky - \\"Crimean\\") unofficially after the abolition of the monarchy: to the White Lieutenant-General Yakov Aleksandrovich Slashchyov in August 1920 for his defence of the Crimea in 1919-1920. =France= First Empire Napoleon I, the founder of the Bonaparte dynasty and only head of the First French Empire, owed his success ‚Äì both his personal rise and the growth of his empire ‚Äì above all to his military excellence, and he bestowed elaborate honours on his generals, especially those raised to the supreme army rank of mar√©chal (marshal). The bestowing of a victory title (), commemorating a specific victory, was an ideal form of honour, and many incumbents were victorious marshals (or posthumously, in chief of the widow). The highest of these titles referenced four nominal principalities, in most cases awarded as a \\"promotion\\" to holders of ducal victory titles: * Marshal Davout, Prince d'Eckm√ºhl ‚Äì 1809 (extinct 1853) ‚Äì also duc d'Auerstaedt (see below) * Marshal Mass√©na, Prince d'Essling ‚Äì 1810 ‚Äì also duc de Rivoli * Marshal Ney, Prince de la Moskowa ‚Äì 1813 (extinct 1969) ‚Äì also duc d'Elchingen ‚Äì Bataille de la Moskowa is the French name for the Battle of Borodino of 1812 * Marshal Berthier, Prince de Wagram ‚Äì 1809 (extinct 1918) ‚Äì also duc de Valengin, and Prince de Neuch√¢tel (a sovereign title granted in 1806), neither of which were victory titles. Next in rank came ten dukedoms: * Marshal Ney, duc de Elchingen ‚Äì 1808 (extinct 1969) ‚Äì also Prince de la Moskowa * Marshal Lefebvre, duc de Dantzig ‚Äì 28 May 1807 (extinct 1820) ‚Äì Dantzig was then still a city republic, which became part of Prussia after Napoleon's defeat, and subsequently Gda≈Ñsk in Poland * General Junot, duc d'Abrant√®s ‚Äì 1808 (extinct 1859 but extended in female line in 1869, again extinct 1985) * Marshal Davout, duc d'Auerstaedt ‚Äì 1808 (extinct 1853, extended to collaterals) ‚Äì also prince d'Eckm√ºhl * Marshal Augereau, duc de Castiglione ‚Äì 1808 (extinct 1915) * Marshal Lannes, duc de Montebello ‚Äì 1808 * Marshal Marmont, duc de Raguse ‚Äì 1808 (extinct 1852) ‚Äì present-day Dubrovnik, on the Croatian coast; conquered as part of Napoleon's own Italian kingdom, soon to become part of France's imperial exclave the Illyrian provinces (1809-1816) * Marshal Mass√©na, duc de Rivoli ‚Äì 1808 ‚Äì also Prince d'Essling * Marshal Kellermann, duc de Valmy ‚Äì 1808 (extinct 1868) * Marshal Suchet, duc d'Albufera ‚Äì 1813 Counts: * Georges Mouton, comte de Lobau - 1810 July Monarchy * Thomas Robert Bugeaud, duc d'Isly - 1844 (from the First Franco-Moroccan War) Second Empire Although Napoleon III never came close to his predecessor's military genius (history tends to remember his defeats), he loved tying into numerous aspects of the First Empire, so he not only revived many of its institutions and reestablished titles Napoleon I had awarded, but also made some new ones. These included: * Marshal P√©lissier, duc de Malakoff ‚Äì 1856 (from the Crimea War, extinct 1864) * Marshal MacMahon, duc de Magenta ‚Äì 1859 (from the Campaign of Italy; a newly invented dye took its name for the same battle) * Charles Cousin-Montauban, comte de Palikao - 1862 (from the Second Opium War) =British Empire= Many victory titles have been created in the peerages of England, Great Britain and the United Kingdom. Examples include: * Godert de Ginkell, victor at the Battle of Aughrim, was created Baron of Aughrim as a subsidiary title of the Earldom of Athlone in 1692. * Admiral Edward Russell, 1st Earl of Orford, victor of the Battle of Barfleur, was created Viscount Barfleur as a subsidiary title of the Earldom of Orford in 1697. * James Stanhope, who captured Port Mahon during the War of the Spanish Succession, was created Viscount Stanhope of Mahon in 1717. * Sir George Augustus Eliott, victor of the Great Siege of Gibraltar, was created Lord Heathfield, Baron Heathfield of Gibraltar in 1787. * Admiral Sir Adam Duncan, victor of the Battle of Camperdown, was created Viscount Duncan of Camperdown in 1797. (His son was later created Earl of Camperdown.) * Admiral Sir John Jervis, victor of the Battle of Cape St Vincent, was created Earl of St Vincent in 1797, and was further created Viscount St Vincent in 1801. * Lieutenant-General Sir Arthur Wellesley (later the 1st Duke of Wellington), victor of the Battle of Douro, was in 1809 created Baron Douro as the subsidiary title granted to him with the Viscountcy of Wellington (see below). He was later, in 1814, created Marquess Douro as the subsidiary title granted to him with the Dukedom of Wellington. * General Sir Robert Napier, who commanded the Abyssinian Expedition of 1868 and captured the fortress of Magd√†la, was created Baron Napier of Magdala in 1868. * The Earl of Dufferin, Governor-General of India during the Third Anglo-Burmese War that resulted in the annexation of Upper Burma including its former capital Ava, was created Marquess of Dufferin and Ava, in the County of Down and the Province of Burma, and Earl of Ava, in the Province of Burma in 1888. * Field Marshal Sir Julian Byng, who played an important role in the Battle of Vimy Ridge (1917), was created Baron Byng of Vimy in 1919 and was later promoted to a viscountcy. * Field Marshal Sir John French, the first commander of the British Expeditionary Force in the First World War, was created Earl of Ypres in 1922. * Field Marshal Sir Bernard Montgomery, in honour of his 1942 victory in the Egyptian town of El Alamein against Rommel's Afrikakorps, was created Viscount Montgomery of Alamein in 1946. * Admiral Sir Bruce Fraser, victor of the Battle of North Cape in 1943, was created Baron Fraser of North Cape in 1946. * Admiral Lord Louis Mountbatten, who oversaw the recapture of Burma from the Japanese, was created Viscount Mountbatten of Burma in 1946 and Earl Mountbatten of Burma in 1947. Often the victory is commemorated in the territorial designation rather than the peerage itself. Examples include: * Robert Clive, victor of the Battle of Plassey, was created Baron Clive, of Plassey in the County of Clare in 1767. * The Lord Amherst, who captured Montreal during the French and Indian War, was created Baron Amherst, of Montreal in the County of Kent in 1788. Though the designation refers to Montreal Park in Kent, the estate had been named after the victory. * Rear-Admiral Sir Horatio Nelson, victor of the Battle of the Nile, was created Baron Nelson, of the Nile and of Burnham Thorpe in the County of Norfolk, in 1798, and (by this time a Vice-Admiral) was further created Viscount Nelson, of the Nile and of Burnham Thorpe in the County of Norfolk. He was created Baron Nelson, of the Nile and of Hilborough in the County of Norfolk in August 1801. After his victory and death at the Battle of Trafalgar, his brother was created Earl Nelson, of Trafalgar and of Merton in the County of Surrey, and Viscount Merton, of Trafalgar and of Merton in the County of Surrey, in 1805, in his honour. (Nelson also earned the Dukedom of Bronte in Sicily, awarded to him in 1799 (in recognition of military support) by King Ferdinand III of the Kingdom of Sicily.) * Lady Abercromby, widow of Sir Ralph Abercromby, victor of the Battle of Aboukir, who had died of wounds received in that battle, was created Baroness Abercromby, of Aboukir and of Tullibody in the County of Clackmannan, in 1801, in honour of her late husband. * John Hely-Hutchinson, victor of the Siege of Alexandria, was created Baron Hutchinson, of Alexandria and Knocklofty in the County of Tipperary, in 1801. * Gerard Lake, victor of the Battle of Delhi (1803) and the Battle of Laswari (1803), was created Baron Lake, of Delhi and Laswary and of Aston Clinton in the County of Buckingham in 1804 and Viscount Lake with the same designation in 1807. * Lieutenant-General Sir Arthur Wellesley (later the 1st Duke of Wellington), victor of the Battle of Talavera, was created Viscount Wellington, of Talavera and of Wellington in the County of Somerset, in 1809. * William Carr Beresford, victor of the Battle of Albuera (1811), was created Baron Beresford, of Albuera and Dungarvan in the County of Waterford in 1814. * Rowland Hill, victor of the Battle of Almaraz (1812), was created Baron Hill, of Almaraz and of Hawkestone in the County of Shropshire in 1814 and Baron Hill, of Almaraz and of Hardwicke in the County of Shropshire in 1816. * George Harris, victor of the Siege of Seringapatam (1799) against the Kingdom of Mysore, was created Baron Harris, of Seringapatam and Mysore in the East Indies and of Belmont in the County of Kent in 1815. * William Amherst, 2nd Baron Amherst, Governor-General of India during the First Anglo-Burmese War (1824-1826) that resulted in the annexation of Arakan, was created Earl Amherst, of Arracan in the East Indies in 1826. * The Lord Combermere, who captured the fort at Bharatpur in 1826 while serving as Commander-in-Chief, India, was created Viscount Combermere, of Bhurtpore in the East Indies and Combermere in the County Palatine of Chester in 1827. * Sir John Keane, commander at the Battle of Ghazni (1839), was created Baron Keane, of Ghuznee in Affghanistan and of Cappoquin in the County of Waterford in 1839. * Sir Hugh Gough, victor at the Battle of Chinkiang (1842), in the Gwalior Campaign (1843) and in the First Anglo-Sikh War (1845-1846), was created Baron Gough, of ChingKangFoo in China and of Maharajpore and the Sutlej in the East Indies in 1846, and following the Battle of Gujrat (1849) was further created Viscount Gough, of Goojerat in the Punjab and of the City of Limerick in 1849. * Sir Henry Hardinge, who concluded the Treaty of Lahore (1846) that ended the First Anglo-Sikh War, was created Viscount Hardinge, of Lahore and of King's Newton in the County of Derby in 1846. * The Earl of Dalhousie, who was Governor-General of India during the Second Anglo-Sikh War (1848-1849) that resulted in the British annexation of the Punjab, was created Marquess of Dalhousie, of Dalhousie Castle in the County of Edinburgh, and of the Punjab in 1849. * Hugh Henry Rose, who captured Jhansi (1858) during the Indian Mutiny, was created Baron Strathnairn, of Strathnairn in the County of Nairn and of Jhansi in the East Indies in 1866. * Sir John Lawrence, who served as Chief Commissioner of the Punjab during the Indian Mutiny of 1857-1859, was created Baron Lawrence, of the Punjab and of Grateley in the County of Southampton in 1869. * Sir Garnet Wolseley, who captured Cairo after the Battle of Tel el-Kebir (1882), was created Baron Wolseley, of Cairo and of Wolseley in the County of Stafford, in 1882. * Sir Frederick Sleigh Roberts, victor of the Battle of Kandahar in 1880, was created Baron Roberts, of Kandahar in Afghanistan and of the City of Waterford in 1892. Following the Battle of Diamond Hill near Pretoria in 1900, he was further created Earl Roberts, of Kandahar in Afghanistan and of Pretoria in the Transvaal Colony and of the City of Waterford in 1901. * Major-General Sir Herbert Kitchener, in recognition of his victory in the Battle of Omdurman (1898), was created Baron Kitchener, of Khartoum and of Aspall in the County of Suffolk (Khartoum being the less obscure but relatively nearby capital of the Anglo-Egyptian Sudan), in 1898. In 1902 (by this time a full General) he was further created Viscount Kitchener of Khartoum, of Khartoum and of the Vaal in the Colony of Transvaal and of Aspall in the County of Suffolk (having been Administrator of Transvaal and of the Orange River Colony in 1901). In June 1914 (having achieved the rank of Field Marshal in 1909) he was further created Earl Kitchener of Khartoum and of Broome, of Khartoum and of Broome in the County of Kent. * Field Marshal Sir John French, the first commander (1914-1915) of the British Expeditionary Force in the First World War, was created Viscount French, of Ypres and of High Lake in the County of Roscommon, in 1916. * Admiral of the Fleet Sir David Beatty, the First Sea Lord (1919-1927) and formerly Commander-in-Chief of the Grand Fleet (1916-1919) during the last years of the First World War, was, as one of the subsidiary titles granted to him with the Earldom of Beatty, created Baron Beatty, of the North Sea and of Brooksby in the County of Leicester, in 1919. * Field Marshal Sir Edmund Allenby, victor of the Battle of Megiddo (1918), was created Viscount Allenby, of Megiddo and of Felixstowe in the County of Suffolk, in 1919. * Field Marshal Sir Herbert Plumer, commander in the Battle of Messines (1917), was created Baron Plumer, of Messines and of Bilton in the County of York, in 1919 and Viscount Plumer, of Messines and of Bilton in the County of York, in 1929. * Field Marshal Sir William Birdwood, best known as the commander (1914-1918) of ANZAC troops in the First World War, was created Baron Birdwood, of Anzac and of Totnes in the County of Devon, in 1938. * Field Marshal Sir Edmund Ironside, who commanded the British forces around Arkhangelsk in the North Russia Campaign of 1918-1920, was created Baron Ironside, of Archangel and Ironside in the County of Aberdeen, in 1941. * Field Marshal Sir Henry Wilson, a senior British general in the Second World War, was created Baron Wilson, of Libya and of Stowlangtoft in the County of Suffolk, in 1946. =Austrian Empire= In the Austrian empire titles of nobility could be amended with territorial designations, the so-called predicates. These were usually named after the estates of the family in question, but sometimes the Habsburg rulers of Austria also granted victory titles. This happened particularly during World War I (1914-1918). Examples include: * Colonel General Viktor Dankl, who in 1914 defeated Russian forces in the Battle of Kra≈õnik. When he was made a Graf (count) in 1918, he received the title of Graf Dankl von Krasnik. * Colonel General Josef Roth, who played a decisive role in the Battle of Limanowa in 1914, when the Austro-Hungarian Army repelled a Russian breakthrough, was ennobled as Freiherr (baron) in 1918 with the style of Freiherr Roth von Limanowa-Lapan√≥w. * Major General Ignaz Trollmann, whose XIX. Corps helped to conquer the Lovƒáen mountain near Kotor in 1916, was ennobled as Freiherr (baron) in 1917 with the style of Freiherr Trollmann von Lovcenberg. =Kingdom of Hungary= The system used in the Kingdom of Hungary by the Habsburgs resembled the one employed in Austria. Titles of nobility could be amended with territorial designations, also called predicates. These were usually named after the estates of the family in question, but sometimes also specific victory titles were granted. Examples include: * General Baron P√°l Kray de Krajova et Topolya (1705-1804), who received the predicate de Krajova or Krajovai after he conquered the Romanian town of Craiova during the Austro-Turkish War (1787‚Äì91). * Colonel General Stefan Sarkotiƒá, the Commanding General in Bosnia and Herzegovina during World War I, was ennobled as a Hungarian baron and the style of Baron Sarkotiƒá von Lovƒáen in early 1917 after Trollmann's XIX. Corps had conquered the Lovƒáen mountain near Kotor. * S√°ndor Szurmay was created baron by King Charles IV with the predicate de Uzsok or Uzsoki. He was the hero of the battle of Uzsok (March 1915). During the Regency of Hungary after World War I, the Regent Mikl√≥s Horthy was not authorized to grant titles of nobility, but conferred the Order of Vit√©z which sometimes but necessarily also carried noble predicates. Initially membership was restricted to men who had served with special distinction in the war. Examples commemorating military action include: * Captain Rihmer de Granaszt√≥ granted the title vit√©z Gerlefalvi for his bravery at Gerlefalva, today Girovce, Slovakia. =Kingdom of Italy= The Kingdom of Italy under the Savoy House of Piemonte-Sardinia granted many victory titles. The practice of bestowing such titles became especially common after the unification of Italy and again after World War I, when the Mussolini government (1922‚Äì1943) made a number of nominations. Examples include: * General Enrico Cialdini, created Duca di Gaeta for his role during the Siege of Gaeta (1860). This was the concluding event of the war between the Kingdom of Sardinia and the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies, through which Cialdini's Piemonte-Sardinian forces secured victory over King Francis II of the Two Sicilies. The choice of this title was somewhat ironic as it had been the name of a Napoleonic duch√© grand-fief but only the withdrawal of the French fleet made the bombardment of Gaeta from the sea by Cialdini's forces possible. * General Armando Diaz, created 1st Duca della Vittoria (\\"Duke of the Victory\\") in 1922. He had been the Chief of Staff of the Italian Army (1917‚Äì1918) during World War I. * Admiral Paolo Thaon di Revel, created 1st Duca del Mare (\\"Duke of the Sea\\") in 1922. He had been the Chief of the Italian Naval Staff (1913‚Äì1915 and 1917‚Äì1919) during World War I. * Commodore Luigi Rizzo, created 1st Conte di Grado e di Premuda for his services as naval commander in World War I during which he also sank the Austrian battleship SMS Szent Istv√°n. * Costanzo Ciano, created 1st Conte di Cortellazzo e di Buccari, a naval commander in World War I and President of the Italian Chamber of Deputies between 1934 and 1939. * Cesare Maria de Vecchi, created 1st Conte di Val Cismon in memory of the battles fought by his arditi on Monte Grappa in 1918. Later served as colonial administrator and Fascist politician. * Gabriele d'Annunzio, created 1st Principe di Montenevoso in 1924 for his services as poet, journalist, novelist, dramatist and aviator during World War I. * Marshal Pietro Badoglio, created 1st Marchese del Sabotino and later 1st Duca di Addis Abeba after the invasion of Abyssinia in 1935. * General Rodolfo Graziani, created 1st Marchese di Neghelli for his services as leader of military expeditions in Africa before and during World War II. * Prince Maurizio Ferrante Gonzaga di Vescovato, created 1st Marchese del Vodice in 1932. Also received the Gold Medal of Military Valor. (Full Titles and decorations, in Italian) =Other monarchies= * The Spanish crown has awarded similar titles, such as Duque de Ciudad Rodrigo (hereditary) for the English Viscount Wellington (later Duke of Wellington). Manuel de Godoy was created Pr√≠ncipe de la Paz (Prince of the Peace) in 1795 after negotiating the Peace of Basel. Jos√© Malcampo, 3rd Marquis of San Rafael, Prime Minister of Spain in 1871, during the reign of King Amadeo I, was granted the titles of Count of Jolo and Viscount of Mindanao after he victoriously took the city of Jolo from the Sultanate of Sulu during his governorship-general (1874-1877) of the Philippines. * So did the Portuguese kingdom, as Duque da Vit√≥ria (Duke of Victory), Marqu√™s de Torres Vedras (from the Lines of Torres Vedras of 1809-1810) and Conde de Vimeiro (from the Battle of Vimeiro of 1808) awarded to the Duke of Wellington. * The Kingdom of Naples awarded the title of Conte di Maida (Count of Maida) to British general John Stuart, commemorating the Battle of Maida in 1806. * The Dutch royal house of Orange, then of the United Kingdom of the Netherlands, created the first Duke of Wellington Prince of Waterloo (in Belgium) in 1815.

It had its peak during the 1960s and 1970s. Native American students who were baptized members of the LDS Church were placed in foster homes of LDS members during the school year. They attended majority-white public schools, rather than the Indian boarding schools or local schools on the reservations. The program was developed according to LDS theology, whereby conversion and assimilation to Mormonism could help Native Americans, who had been classified as Lamanites in terms of theology in the Book of Mormon. An estimated 50,000 Native American children went through the program.Lilly Fowler, \\"Why Several Native Americans Are Suing the Mormon Church\\", The Atlantic, 23 October 2016; accessed 5 December 2016 The foster placement was intended to help develop leadership among Native Americans and assimilate them into majority-American culture. The cost of care was borne by the foster parents, and financially stable families were selected by the church. Most of these placements took place on the Navajo Nation, with a peak participation of 5,000 students in 1972. The program decreased in size after the 1970s, due to criticism, changing mores among Native Americans, and restriction of the program to high school students as schools improved on reservations. Many of the students and families praised the program; others criticized it and the LDS Church for weakening the Native Americans' ties to their own cultures. In the spring of 2015, four plaintiffs (now referred to as the \\"Doe Defendants\\") filed suit in the Window Rock District of the Navajo Nation Tribal Court, alleging they had been sexually abused for years while in the foster program, roughly from the years 1965 to 1983, and the LDS Church did not adequately protect them.Suzette Brewer, \\"Navajo Nation Has Jurisdiction in Mormon Sex Abuse Case, Judge Rules\\", Indian Country Today, 18 November 2016; accessed 5 December 2016 The church filed suit in federal district court in Salt Lake City, alleging that the Tribal Court did not have jurisdiction and seeking an injunction \\"to stay the proceedings from moving forward under tribal jurisdiction.\\" Federal district court judge Robert Shelby denied the church's motion to dismiss and also ruled that it first had to \\"exhaust all remedies\\" in Tribal Court. This is considered a major victory for tribal jurisprudence. History =Precursors= During the earliest days of the LDS Church in Utah, Mormons often raised Native American children in their homes. Leader Brigham Young advocated buying children held by Native Americans and Mexican traders as slaves (a legal practice in the Utah Territory prior to the American Civil War), freeing them from slavery, and encouraged Latter-day Saints to educate and acculturate the children as if they were their own. LDS theology suggests that the Native Americans have a special status. It held that Native Americans had two distinct phenotypes: \\"Nephites, light-skinned, \\"righteous and civilized people;\\" and Lamanites, \\"idle, savage and bloodthirsty,\\" for which they were \\"cursed by God\\" with dark skin.\\" Although this is a prevailing view, there are alternative perspectives about whether the distinction referred to in the Book of Mormon actually referred to skin color. These differing views are more complex than popular and simplistic characterizations portray. For more, see Brant A. Gardner, \\"What Does the Book of Mormon Mean by 'Skin of Blackness?'\\"https://www.fairmormon.org/archive/publications/what-does-the- book-of-mormon-mean-by-skin-of-blackness The Indian Student Placement Program (ISPP) of the late 20th century developed from an informal placement in 1947 in Richfield, Utah by the LDS Church. A 16-year old Navajo teenager, Helen John, asked permission to stay in the city to go to school. As a result, Golden Buchanan and Miles Jensen organized an informal placement program under the direction of Spencer W. Kimball, who was the chairman of the church's Committee on Indian Relationships. With her parent's permission, Helen was allowed to stay with the Buchanan family, whom she knew in Richfield. This arrangement was not an official program, but it was the basis for the Indian Placement Program that would later be established. The Buchanans agreed to take in other children as well, and that year three students were placed into the unofficial program. These arrangements continued, and by 1954 there were some 68 Native American students (mostly from the Navajo Nation) placed into foster homes in four different western states. > The ISPP worked to instill Western notions of industry through the > imposition of an ethno-religious identity. The Lamanite identity defined > Indians as culturally and spiritually apostate Israelites destined for > latter-day restoration through an internalized Protestant work ethic. > Although some rejected this theological identity others found it a point of > strength and empowerment as they attended schools and participated in > specific ISPP efforts to develop Western leadership patterns among Native > American participants.Matthew Garrett, Mormons, Indians and Lamanites: The > Indian Student Placement Program, 1947-2000. Ph.D. dissertation, Arizona > State University, 2010; accessed 5 December 2016 The ISPP was defined as an \\"educational opportunity,\\" as opposed to foster care. Its objective was the \\"assimilation and \\"whitening\\" of Indian children as a divine imperative outlined in the Book of Mormon.\\"Suzette Brewer, \\"‚ÄòI am X‚Äô: Mormon Church Faces Growing Sex Abuse Scandal, Pt. 1\\", Indian Country Today, 19 October 2016; accessed 5 December 2016 The church members believed that, \\"by educating and assimilating Indian children into Mormon culture and religion they could be \\"lightened,\\" thereby breaking their Lamanite (or dark- skinned) \\"curse\\" and restoring the prophecy of their redemption.\\" In 2013, the LDS Church officially renounced this folk belief. =Organization of the Indian Placement Program= The success of these students led to the church establishing a formal placement program in July 1954, under the Church Social Services, which was part of the Relief Society. Under this program, a social worker was assigned to each Native American foster child. A reception center was built in Richfield to accommodate the large numbers of participants. Buses and other transportation were arranged to bring children to the center where they would be fed, receive medical examinations, and be introduced to their foster families. Students participated from the Navajo Nation and other tribes in the Southwest, as well as some from other parts of the United States. When the program became institutionalized, there were some complaints that LDS missionaries were assigned to recruit new participants. In 1956, the Bureau of Indian Affairs received complaints that the placement program was being used to increase the church's proselytizing efforts. The governments of Utah and Arizona in March 1957 met with church representatives to address the issue. As a result, caseworkers rather than missionaries were given the responsibility of making the final decision for acceptance of students into the Indian Placement Program. In order for children to participate in the program, their parents had to request their placement. Foster parents were recommended by local bishops and were expected to provide free room, board, and clothing for the Native American children. These children had to be at least eight years old, baptized as members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, and be in good standing in the church and in good health. In October 1960, Kimball discussed the program at the General Conference. He said that Natives who participated in the program were gradually turning lighter, becoming 'white and delightsome.'Alysa Landry, \\"Navajo Siblings Claim ‚ÄòHorrific‚Äô Sexual Abuse; Sue Mormons\\", Indian Country Today, 5 April 2016; accessed 5 December 2016 \\"The day of the Lamanites is nigh,\\" Kimball said, claiming that Navajo placement students were \\"as light as Anglos\\" and, in one case, several shades lighter than parents \\"on the same reservation, in the same hogan, subject to the same sun and wind and weather.\\" The Church has moved away from other race- based qualifications that, while practiced, were never accepted as doctrine and have been repudiated by the church. See, e.g. Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints, \\"Race and the Priesthood.\\"The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Additionally, racial references in scripture headings, not considered doctrine, have been removed.http://archive.sltrib.com/article.php?id=50882900&itype;=CMSID Development Some families had their children baptized in the church in order to gain the opportunity to go to school off the reservation. To avoid this, in the 1950s and 1960s, the church added new requirements for acceptance of children into the program. In 1969, the Unified Social Services was established in the church; this became the administrative body to run the Indian Placement Program. In 1973 it was renamed and organized as LDS Social Services. By 1972, nearly 5,000 Native Americans were living in foster homes through this program. Some students went on to study at Brigham Young University, earning college degrees. In 1971 they created a performance group of singers and dancers called \\"The Lamanite Generation.\\" Among their pieces was \\"Go My Son,\\" a song referring to the \\"ladder of education.\\"Alysa Landry, \\"Assimilation Tool or Blessing? Inside the Mormon Indian Student Placement Program\\", Indian Country Today, 7 January 2016; accessed 8 December 2016 In 1972 local priesthood leaders were given the responsibility for recruiting and screening new students. Due to strong criticism and rising Native American activism, the program had nearly been discontinued in 1977. The US government commissioned a study under the Interstate Compact Secretariat, which oversaw educational efforts. It heard much praise from Native American families for the program. After assessing the program results and hearing testimonial from participants and foster families, the church decided to continue it. After 1972, the number of students that participated in the program decreased. By the late 1970s, the number of participants in the Indian Placement Program was around 2,500. In response to the improvement of local schools developed on the reservations in preference to boarding schools, in the 1980s the Indian Placement Program limited participants to high-school students; the number of students dropped to 500 in 1990. In 1996 there were virtually no more participants, although the last graduated in 2000. In the 1970s, the Indian Placement Program was directed to emphasize creating stronger bonds and increased communication between the natural families and the selected foster families. The goal of the program was to \\"introduce Native Americans to mainstream values and social roles without demanding the abandonment of the old for the new.\\" According to the Maxwell Institute of BYU, it attempted to help Native Americans receive more formal education and training, while helping them maintain their identity. Results Multiple studies have been conducted of the program. As recorded, about one-third of the participants stayed in the program until graduation from high school. 40 percent of students decided to drop out of the program, and 15 percent of students left the program because of their parents' wishes or needs. Students who did drop out were still more likely to finish high school than were Native American peers who had not participated in the program. Students in the Indian Placement Program had an 82 percent graduation rate. Studies found that the \\"longer students remained in the program, the more likely they were to be employed and to earn high incomes\\" and also to marry. Criticism Beginning in the 1970s, however, the Indian Placement Program was increasingly criticized. In 1977, the U.S. government commissioned a study to investigate accusations that the church was using its influence to push children into joining the program. The commission found that the program was largely positive, and enjoyed emphatic support both from Native American parents and white foster parents. Critics \\"view intervention as an intrusion on the right to be fully Native American, a weakening of cultural pluralism, and a cause of psychological damage.\\" Most of the students came from the Navajo Nation. =Sexual abuse litigation= On March 22, 2016, two members of the Navajo Nation, (plaintiffs \\"RJ\\" and \\"MM\\") filed a complaint in Navajo Nation District Court (a tribal court) against LDS Family Services and against the Corporation of the President, alleging sexual abuse during their foster placement in the IPP from 1976 to 1983. Their complaint was amended April 21. On May 31, 2016 a third Navajo plaintiff (\\"BN\\") filed a lawsuit alleging abuse from 1965 to 1972. On June 6, a fourth plaintiff (\\"LK\\") sued in Navajo Nation District Court. Also on May 31, attorneys for the LDS Church petitioned for declaratory judgement in the United States District Court for the District of Utah (not the tribal court), seeking both a declaration that the tribal court lacked subject matter jurisdiction over the Church, and an order enjoining the lawsuit from proceeding in tribal court. Because the Church's suit was filed against the Navajo plaintiffs in the District Court, the Church becomes the plaintiff in the federal jurisdiction. On June 3, LDS Church attorneys expanded their motion to Judge Robert Shelby in District Court to include plaintiff BN, and amended their response to seek a federal order restraining the tribal court from proceeding. In November 2016, Federal district court judge Robert Shelby denied the church's motion to dismiss and ruled that it first had to \\"exhaust all remedies\\" in Tribal Court. Shelby wrote that it was necessary to allow the Navajo Nation courts to develop the factual record, because \\"the existing record is significantly incomplete concerning the nature and scope of the agreements [between the LDS Church and the defendants], and any nexus between those agreements and the alleged conduct\\" alleged in the Doe Defendants' complaints. > By ordering the Mormon Church to first exhaust its legal remedies in tribal > court, Shelby said that the Navajo Nation judicial system would then be able > to assess the facts of the case and whether jurisdiction was on the table. > Further, it would allow the Navajo courts time to analyze the complex legal > and factual issues at hand‚Äîthus advancing Congress's explicit policy in > promoting tribal self-governance and the development of tribal court > jurisprudence. This ruling is considered a major victory for tribal > jurisprudence.

Historically, Kashmir referred to the Kashmir Valley. Today, it denotes a larger area that includes the Indian-administered union territories of Jammu and Kashmir (which consists of Jammu and the Kashmir Valley) and Ladakh, the Pakistan-administered territories of Azad Kashmir and Gilgit‚ÄìBaltistan, and the Chinese-administered regions of Aksai Chin and the Trans-Karakoram Tract. In the first half of the 1st millennium, the Kashmir region became an important centre of Hinduism and later of Buddhism; later in the ninth century, Shaivism arose. Islamization in Kashmir took place during 13th to 15th century and led to the eventual decline of the Kashmir Shaivism in Kashmir. However, the achievements of the previous civilizations were not lost. In 1339, Shah Mir became the first Muslim ruler of Kashmir, inaugurating the Shah Mir dynasty. For the next five centuries, Muslim monarchs ruled Kashmir, including the Mughal Empire, who ruled from 1586 until 1751, and the Afghan Durrani Empire, which ruled from 1747 until 1819. That year, the Sikhs, under Ranjit Singh, annexed Kashmir. In 1846, after the Sikh defeat in the First Anglo-Sikh War, the Treaty of Lahore was signed and upon the purchase of the region from the British under the Treaty of Amritsar, the Raja of Jammu, Gulab Singh, became the new ruler of Kashmir. The rule of his descendants, under the paramountcy (or tutelage) of the British Crown, lasted until 1947, when the former princely state became a disputed territory, now administered by three countries: India, Pakistan, and the People's Republic of China. Etymology According to folk etymology, the name \\"Kashmir\\" means \\"desiccated land\\" (from the Sanskrit: Ka = water and shimeera = desiccate). In the Rajatarangini, a history of Kashmir written by Kalhana in the mid-12th century, it is stated that the valley of Kashmir was formerly a lake. According to Hindu mythology, the lake was drained by the great rishi or sage, Kashyapa, son of Marichi, son of Brahma, by cutting the gap in the hills at Baramulla (Varaha-mula). When Kashmir had been drained, Kashyapa asked Brahmins to settle there. This is still the local tradition, and in the existing physical condition of the country, we may see some ground for the story which has taken this form. The name of Kashyapa is by history and tradition connected with the draining of the lake, and the chief town or collection of dwellings in the valley was called Kashyapa-pura, which has been identified with Kaspapyros of Hecataeus (apud Stephanus of Byzantium) and Kaspatyros of Herodotus (3.102, 4.44). Kashmir is also believed to be the country meant by Ptolemy's Kaspeiria. Cashmere is an archaic spelling of Kashmir, and in some countries it is still spelled this way. Historiography Nilmata Purana (complied c. 500‚Äì600 CE) contains accounts of Kashmir's early history. However, being a Puranic source, it has been argued that it suffers from a degree of inconsistency and unreliability. Kalhana's Rajatarangini (River of Kings), all the 8000 Sanskrit verses of which were completed by 1150 CE, chronicles the history of Kashmir's dynasties from mythical times to the 12th century. It relies upon traditional sources like Nilmata Purana, inscriptions, coins, monuments, and Kalhana's personal observations borne out of political experiences of his family. Towards the end of the work mythical explanations give way to rational and critical analyses of dramatic events between 11th and 12th centuries, for which Kalhana is often credited as India's first historian. During the reign of Muslim kings in Kashmir, three supplements to Rajatarangini were written by Jonaraja (1411‚Äì1463 CE), Srivara, and Prajyabhatta and Suka, which end with Akbar's conquest of Kashmir in 1586 CE. The text was translated into Persian by Muslim scholars such as Nizam Uddin, Farishta, and Abul Fazl. Baharistan-i-Shahi and Haidar Mailk's Tarikh-i-Kashmir (completed in 1621 CE) are the most important texts on the history of Kashmir during the Sultanate period. Both the texts were written in Persian and used Rajatarangini and Persian histories as their sources. Early history This general view of the unexcavated Buddhist stupa near Baramulla, with two figures standing on the summit, and another at the base with measuring scales, was taken by John Burke in 1868. The stupa, which was later excavated, dates to 500 CE. Earliest Neolithic sites in the flood plains of Kashmir valley are dated to c. 3000 BCE. Most important of these sites are the settlements at Burzahom, which had two Neolithic and one Megalithic phases. First phase (c. 2920 BCE) at Burzahom is marked by mud plastered pit dwellings, coarse pottery and stone tools. In the second phase, which lasted till c. 1700 BCE, houses were constructed on ground level and the dead were buried, sometimes with domesticated and wild animals. Hunting and fishing were the primary modes of subsistence though evidence of cultivation of wheat, barley, and lentils has also been found in both the phases. In the megalithic phase, massive circles were constructed and grey or black burnish replaced coarse red ware in pottery. During the later Vedic period, as kingdoms of the Vedic tribes expanded, the Uttara‚ÄìKurus settled in Kashmir. Kanishka inaugurates Mahayana Buddhism in Kashmir. In 326 BCE, Porus asked Abisares, the king of Kashmir, to aid him against Alexander the Great in the Battle of Hydaspes. After Porus lost the battle, Abhisares submitted to Alexander by sending him treasure and elephants. During the reign of Ashoka (304‚Äì232 BCE), Kashmir became a part of the Maurya Empire and Buddhism was introduced in Kashmir. During this period, many stupas, some shrines dedicated to Shiva, and the city of Srinagari (Srinagar) were built. Kanishka (127‚Äì151 CE), an emperor of the Kushan dynasty, conquered Kashmir and established the new city of Kanishkapur. Buddhist tradition holds that Kanishka held the Fourth Buddhist council in Kashmir, in which celebrated scholars such as Ashvagosha, Nagarjuna and Vasumitra took part. By the fourth century, Kashmir became a seat of learning for both Buddhism and Hinduism. Kashmiri Buddhist missionaries helped spread Buddhism to Tibet and China and from the fifth century CE, pilgrims from these countries started visiting Kashmir. KumƒÅrajƒ´va (343‚Äì413 CE) was among the renowned Kashmiri scholars who traveled to China. He influenced the Chinese emperor Yao Xing and spearheaded translation of many Sanskrit works into Chinese at the Chang'an monastery. Portable shrine with image of the Buddha, Jammu and Kashmir, 7-8th century. Hepthalites (White Huns) under Toramana crossed over the Hindu Kush mountains and conquered large parts of western India including Kashmir. His son Mihirakula (c. 502‚Äì530 CE) led a military campaign to conquer all of North India. He was opposed by Baladitya in Magadha and eventually defeated by Yasodharman in Malwa. After the defeat, Mihirakula returned to Kashmir where he led a coup on the king. He then conquered of Gandhara where he committed many atrocities on Buddhists and destroyed their shrines. Influence of the Huns faded after Mihirakula's death. After seventh century, significant developments took place in Kashmiri Hinduism. In the centuries that followed, Kashmir produced many poets, philosophers, and artists who contributed to Sanskrit literature and Hindu religion. Among notable scholars of this period was Vasugupta (c. 875‚Äì925 CE) who wrote the Shiva Sutras which laid the foundation for a monistic Shaiva system called Kashmir Shaivism. Dualistic interpretation of Shaiva scripture was defeated by Abhinavagupta (c. 975‚Äì1025 CE) who wrote many philosophical works on Kashmir Shaivism. Kashmir Shaivism was adopted by the common masses of Kashmir and strongly influenced Shaivism in Southern India. Martand Sun Temple Central shrine, dedicated to the deity Surya. The temple complex was built by the third ruler of the Karkota dynasty, Lalitaditya Muktapida, in the 8th century CE. It is one of the largest temple complex on the Indian Subcontinent. In the eighth century, the Karkota Empire established themselves as rulers of Kashmir. Kashmir grew as an imperial power under the Karkotas. Chandrapida of this dynasty was recognized by an imperial order of the Chinese emperor as the king of Kashmir. His successor Lalitaditya Muktapida lead a successful military campaign against the Tibetans. He then defeated Yashovarman of Kanyakubja and subsequently conquered eastern kingdoms of Magadha, Kamarupa, Gauda, and Kalinga. Lalitaditya extended his influence of Malwa and Gujarat and defeated Arabs at Sindh. After his demise, Kashmir's influence over other kingdoms declined and the dynasty ended in c. 855‚Äì856 CE. Utpala dynasty founded by Avantivarman followed the Kakrotas. His successor Shankaravarman (885‚Äì902 CE) led a successful military campaign against Gurjaras in Punjab. Political instability in the 10th century made the royal body guards (Tantrins) very powerful in Kashmir. Under the Tantrins, civil administration collapsed and chaos reigned in Kashmir till they were defeated by Chakravarman. Queen Didda, who descended from the Hindu Shahis of Kabul on her mother's side, took over as the ruler in second half of the 10th century. After her death in 1003 CE, the throne passed to Lohara dynasty. During the 11th century, Mahmud of Ghazni made two attempts to conquer Kashmir. However, both his campaigns failed because he could not siege the fortress at Lohkot.  Muslim rulers  Gateway of enclosure of Zein-ul-ab-ud-din's Tomb, in Srinagar. 1868. John Burke. Oriental and India Office Collection. British Library. = Prelude and Kashmir Sultanate (1346‚Äì1580s) = Historian Mohibbul Hasan states that the oppressive taxation, corruption, internecine fights and rise of feudal lords (Damaras) during the unpopular rule of the Lohara dynasty (1003‚Äì1320 CE) paved the way for foreign invasions of Kashmir. Suhadeva, last king of the Lohara dynasty, fled Kashmir after Zulju (Dulacha), a Turkic‚ÄìMongol chief, led a savage raid on Kashmir. Rinchana, a Tibetan Buddhist refugee in Kashmir, established himself as the ruler after Zulju. Rinchana's conversion to Islam is a subject of Kashmiri folklore. He was persuaded to accept Islam by his minister Shah Mir, probably for political reasons. Islam had penetrated into countries outside Kashmir and in absence of the support from Hindus, who were in a majority, Rinchana needed the support of the Kashmiri Muslims. Shah Mir's coup on Rinchana's successor secured Muslim rule and the rule of his dynasty in Kashmir. In the 14th century, Islam gradually became the dominant religion in Kashmir. With the fall of Kashmir, a premier center of Sanskrit literary creativity, Sanskrit literature there disappeared. Islamic preacher Sheikh Nooruddin Noorani, who is traditionally revered by Hindus as Nund Rishi, combined elements of Kashmir Shaivism with Sufi mysticism in his discourses. The Sultans between 1354 and 1470 CE were tolerant of other religions with the exception of Sultan Sikandar (1389‚Äì1413 CE). Sultan Sikandar imposed taxes on non‚ÄìMuslims, forced conversions to Islam, and earned the title But‚ÄìShikan for destroying idols. Sultan Zain-ul- Abidin (c. 1420‚Äì1470 CE) invited artists and craftsmen from Central Asia and Persia to train local artists in Kashmir. Under his rule the arts of wood carving, papier-m√¢ch√© , shawl and carpet weaving prospered. For a brief period in the 1470s, states of Jammu, Poonch and Rajauri which paid tributes to Kashmir revolted against the Sultan Hajji Khan. However, they were subjugated by his son Hasan Khan who took over as ruler in 1472 CE. By the mid 16th century, Hindu influence in the courts and role of the Hindu priests had declined as Muslim missionaries immigrated into Kashmir from Central Asia and Persia, and Persian replaced Sanskrit as the official language. Around the same period, the nobility of Chaks had become powerful enough to unseat the Shah Mir dynasty. Silver sasnu of the Kashmir Sultan Shams al-Din Shah II (ruled 1537‚Äì38). During the Sultanate period, the Kashmir sultans issued silver and copper coins. The silver coins were square and followed a weight standard unique to Kashmir of between 6 and 7 gm. This coin weighs 6.16 gm. Mughal general Mirza Muhammad Haidar Dughlat, a member of ruling family in Kashgar, invaded Kashmir in c. 1540 CE on behalf of emperor Humayun. Persecution of Shias, Shafi'is and Sufis and instigation by Suri kings led to a revolt which overthrew Dughlat's rule in Kashmir. = Mughals (1580s‚Äì1750s) = Kashmir did not witness direct Mughal rule till the reign of Mughal badshah (emperor) Akbar the Great, who visited the valley himself in 1589 CE. Akbar conquered Kashmir by deceit, and later added it in 1586 to his Afghan province Kabul Subah, but Shah Jahan carved it out as a separate subah (imperial top-level province), with seat at Srinagar. During successive Mughal emperors many celebrated gardens, mosques and palaces were constructed. Religious intolerance and discriminatory taxation reappeared when Mughal emperor Aurangzeb ascended to the throne in 1658 CE. After his death, the influence of the Mughal Empire declined. In 1700 CE, a servant of a wealthy Kashmir merchant brought Mo-i Muqqadas (the hair of the Prophet), a relic of Muhammad, to the valley. The relic was housed in the Hazratbal Shrine on the banks of Dal Lake. Nadir Shah's invasion of India in 1738 CE further weakened Mughal control over Kashmir.  Sikh rule (1820‚Äì1846)  Sheikh Imam-ud-din, governor of Kashmir under the Sikhs, shown along with Ranjur Singh and Dewan Dina Nath. 1847. (James Duffield Harding) After four centuries of Muslim rule under the Mughals and the Shah Mir Dynasty, Kashmir fell to the conquering armies of the Sikhs under Ranjit Singh of Punjab. As the Kashmiris had suffered under the Afghans, they initially welcomed the new Sikh rulers. However, the Sikh governors turned out to be hard taskmasters, and Sikh rule was generally considered oppressive, protected perhaps by the remoteness of Kashmir from the capital of the Sikh Empire in Lahore. The Sikhs enacted a number of anti-Muslim laws, which included handing out death sentences for cow slaughter, closing down the Jamia Masjid in Srinagar, and banning the azaan, the public Muslim call to prayer. Kashmir had also now begun to attract European visitors, several of whom wrote of the abject poverty of the vast Muslim peasantry and of the exorbitant taxes under the Sikhs. High taxes, according to some contemporary accounts, had depopulated large tracts of the countryside, allowing only one-sixteenth of the cultivable land to be cultivated. However, after a famine in 1832, the Sikhs reduced the land tax to half the produce of the land and also began to offer interest-free loans to farmers; Kashmir became the second highest revenue earner for the Sikh empire. During this time Kashmiri shawls became known worldwide, attracting many buyers especially in the west. Earlier, in 1780, after the death of Ranjit Deo, the Raja of Jammu, the kingdom of Jammu (to the south of the Kashmir valley) was also captured by the Sikhs and afterwards, until 1846, became a tributary to the Sikh power. Ranjit Deo's grandnephew, Gulab Singh, subsequently sought service at the court of Ranjit Singh, distinguished himself in later campaigns, especially the annexation of the Kashmir valley, and, for his services, was appointed governor of Jammu in 1820. With the help of his officer, Zorawar Singh, Gulab Singh soon captured for the Sikhs the lands of Ladakh and Baltistan to the east and north-east, respectively, of Jammu.  Princely State of Kashmir and Jammu (Dogra Rule, 1846‚Äì1947)  Portrait of Maharaja Gulab Singh in 1847, a year after signing the Treaty of Amritsar. (Artist: James Duffield Harding). In 1845, the First Anglo-Sikh War broke out, and Gulab Singh \\"contrived to hold himself aloof till the battle of Sobraon (1846), when he appeared as a useful mediator and the trusted advisor of Sir Henry Lawrence. Two treaties were concluded. By the first the State of Lahore (i.e. West Punjab) handed over to the British, as equivalent for (rupees) ten million of indemnity, the hill countries between Beas and Indus; by the second the British made over to Gulab Singh for (Rupees) 7.5 million all the hilly or mountainous country situated to the east of Indus and west of Ravi\\" (i.e. the Vale of Kashmir). The Treaty of Amritsar freed Gulab Singh from obligations towards the Sikhs and made him the Maharajah of Jammu and Kashmir. The Dogras' loyalty came in handy to the British during the revolt of 1857 which challenged British rule in India. Dogras refused to provide sanctuary to mutineers, allowed English women and children to seek asylum in Kashmir and sent Kashmiri troops to fight on behalf of the British. British in return rewarded them by securing the succession of Dogra rule in Kashmir. Soon after Gulab Singh's death in 1857, his son, Ranbir Singh, added the emirates of Hunza, Gilgit and Nagar to the kingdom. Princely State of Kashmir and Jammu. The names of different regions, important cities, rivers and mountains are underlined in red. The Princely State of Kashmir and Jammu (as it was then called) was constituted between 1820 and 1858 and was \\"somewhat artificial in composition and it did not develop a fully coherent identity, partly as a result of its disparate origins and partly as a result of the autocratic rule which it experienced on the fringes of Empire.\\"Bowers, Paul. 2004. \\"Kashmir.\\" Research Paper 4/28 , International Affairs and Defence, House of Commons Library, United Kingdom. It combined disparate regions, religions, and ethnicities: to the east, Ladakh was ethnically and culturally Tibetan and its inhabitants practised Buddhism; to the south, Jammu had a mixed population of Hindus, Muslims and Sikhs; in the heavily populated central Kashmir valley, the population was overwhelmingly Sunni Muslim, however, there was also a small but influential Hindu minority, the Kashmiri brahmins or pandits; to the northeast, sparsely populated Baltistan had a population ethnically related to Ladakh, but which practised Shi'a Islam; to the north, also sparsely populated, Gilgit Agency, was an area of diverse, mostly Shi'a groups; and, to the west, Punch was Muslim, but of different ethnicity than the Kashmir valley. Despite being in a majority the Muslims were made to suffer severe oppression under Hindu rule in the form of high taxes, unpaid forced labor and discriminatory laws. Many Kashmiri Muslims migrated from the Valley to Punjab due to famine and policies of Dogra rulers. The Muslim peasantry was vast, impoverished and ruled by a Hindu elite. The Muslim peasants lacked education, awareness of rights and were chronically in debt to landlords and moneylenders, and did not organize politically until the 1930s. 1947 Ranbir Singh's grandson Hari Singh, who had ascended the throne of Kashmir in 1925, was the reigning monarch in 1947 at the conclusion of British rule of the subcontinent and the subsequent partition of the British Indian Empire into the newly independent Dominion of India and Dominion of Pakistan. An internal revolt began in the Poonch region against oppressive taxation by the Maharaja.Prem Nath Bazaz, \\"The Truth About Kashmir\\" In August, Maharaja's forces fired upon demonstrations in favour of Kashmir joining Pakistan, burned whole villages and massacred innocent people.Official Records of the United Nations Security Council, Meeting No:234, 1948, pp.250‚Äì1: The Poonch rebels declared an independent government of \\"Azad\\" Kashmir on 24 October.1947 Kashmir History Rulers of Princely States were encouraged to accede their States to either Dominion ‚Äì India or Pakistan, taking into account factors such as geographical contiguity and the wishes of their people. In 1947, Kashmir's population was \\"77% Muslim and 20% Hindu\\". To postpone making a hurried decision, the Maharaja signed a standstill agreement with Pakistan, which ensured continuity of trade, travel, communication, and similar services between the two. Such an agreement was pending with India. Following huge riots in Jammu, in October 1947, Pashtuns from Pakistan's North-West Frontier Province recruited by the Poonch rebels, invaded Kashmir, along with the Poonch rebels, allegedly incensed by the atrocities against fellow Muslims in Poonch and Jammu. The tribesmen engaged in looting and killing along the way.Pathan Tribal Invasion into Kashmir The ostensible aim of the guerilla campaign was to frighten Hari Singh into submission. Instead the Maharaja appealed to the Government of India for assistance, and the Governor-General Lord Mountbatten agreed on the condition that the ruler accede to India. Once the Maharaja signed the Instrument of Accession, Indian soldiers entered Kashmir and drove the Pakistani-sponsored irregulars from all but a small section of the state. India accepted the accession, regarding it provisionalGovt. of India, White Paper on Jammu & Kashmir , Delhi 1948, p.77 until such time as the will of the people can be ascertained. Kashmir leader Sheikh Abdullah endorsed the accession as ad-hoc which would be ultimately decided by the people of the State. He was appointed the head of the emergency administration by the Maharaja.Sheikh Abdullah, Flames of the Chinar, New Delhi 1993, p.97 The Pakistani government immediately contested the accession, suggesting that it was fraudulent, that the Maharaja acted under duress and that he had no right to sign an agreement with India when the standstill agreement with Pakistan was still in force. : See also: 1947 Poonch Rebellion, 1947 Jammu massacres, Indo-Pakistani War of 1947 and The Accession of the Princely States. Post-1947 In early 1948, India sought a resolution of the Kashmir Conflict at the United Nations. Following the set-up of the United Nations Commission for India and Pakistan (UNCIP), the UN Security Council passed Resolution 47 on 21April 1948. The UN mission insisted that the opinion of people of J&K; must be ascertained. The then Indian Prime Minister is reported to have himself urged U.N. to poll Kashmir and on the basis of results Kashmir's accession will be decided. However, India insisted that no referendum could occur until all of the state had been cleared of irregulars. On 5 January 1949, UNCIP (United Nations Commission for India and Pakistan) resolution stated that the question of the accession of the State of Jammu and Kashmir to India or Pakistan will be decided through a free and impartial plebiscite. As per the 1948 and 1949 UNCIP Resolutions, both countries accepted the principle, that Pakistan secures the withdrawal of Pakistani intruders followed by withdrawal of Pakistani and Indian forces, as a basis for the formulation of a Truce agreement whose details are to be arrived in future, followed by a plebiscite; However, both countries failed to arrive at a Truce agreement due to differences in interpretation of the procedure for and extent of demilitarisation one of them being whether the Azad Kashmiri army of Pakistan is to be disbanded during the truce stage or the plebiscite stage. In the last days of 1948, a ceasefire was agreed under UN auspices; however, since the plebiscite demanded by the UN was never conducted, relations between India and Pakistan soured, and eventually led to three more wars over Kashmir in 1965, 1971 and 1999. India has control of about half the area of the former princely state of Jammu and Kashmir; Pakistan controls a third of the region, governing it as Gilgit‚ÄìBaltistan and Azad Kashmir. According to Encyclop√¶dia Britannica, \\"Although there was a clear Muslim majority in Kashmir before the 1947 partition and its economic, cultural, and geographic contiguity with the Muslim-majority area of the Punjab (in Pakistan) could be convincingly demonstrated, the political developments during and after the partition resulted in a division of the region. Pakistan was left with territory that, although basically Muslim in character, was thinly populated, relatively inaccessible, and economically underdeveloped. The largest Muslim group, situated in the Valley of Kashmir and estimated to number more than half the population of the entire region, lay in Indian- administered territory, with its former outlets via the Jhelum valley route blocked.\\" Cease-fire line between India and Pakistan after the 1947 conflict The UN Security Council on 20 January 1948 passed Resolution 39 establishing a special commission to investigate the conflict. Subsequent to the commission's recommendation the Security Council, ordered in its Resolution 47, passed on 21 April 1948 that the invading Pakistani army retreat from Jammu & Kashmir and that the accession of Kashmir to either India or Pakistan be determined in accordance with a plebiscite to be supervised by the UN. In a string of subsequent resolutions the Security Council took notice of the continuing failure by India to hold the plebiscite. However, no punitive action against India could be taken by the Security Council because its resolution, requiring India to hold a Plebiscite, was non-binding. Moreover, the Pakistani army never left the part of the Kashmir, they managed to keep occupied at the end of the 1947 war. They were required by the Security Council resolution 47 to remove all armed personnels from the Azad Kashmir before holding the plebiscite. The eastern region of the erstwhile princely state of Kashmir has also been beset with a boundary dispute. In the late 19th- and early 20th centuries, although some boundary agreements were signed between Great Britain, Afghanistan and Russia over the northern borders of Kashmir, China never accepted these agreements, and the official Chinese position did not change with the communist revolution in 1949. By the mid-1950s the Chinese army had entered the north-east portion of Ladakh.:\\"Kashmir.\\" (2007). In Encyclop√¶dia Britannica.

In 1949, the Indian government obliged Hari Singh to leave Jammu and Kashmir and yield the government to Sheikh Abdullah, the leader of a popular political party, the National Conference Party.Schofield, Victoria. 'Kashmir: The origins of the dispute', BBC News UK Edition (16 January 2002) Retrieved 20 May 2005 Since then, a bitter enmity has been developed between India and Pakistan and three wars have taken place between them over Kashmir. The growing dispute over Kashmir and the consistent failure of democracyElections in Kashmir also led to the rise of Kashmir nationalism and militancy in the state. Following the disputed elections in 1987, young disaffected Kashmiris in the Valley such as the HAJY group ‚Äì Abdul Hamid Shaikh, Ashfaq Majid Wani, Javed Ahmed Mir and Mohammed Yasin Malik ‚Äì were recruited by the Jammu and Kashmir Liberation Front(JKLF) and the popular insurgency in the Kashmir Valley increased in momentum from this point on.1989 Insurgency The year 1989 saw the intensification of conflict in Jammu and Kashmir as Mujahadeens from Afghanistan slowly infiltrated the region following the end of the Soviet‚ÄìAfghan War the same year.BBC Timeline on Kashmir conflict.

These changes will come into effect from 31 October 2019. Historical demographics of Kashmir In the 1901 Census of the British Indian Empire, the population of the princely state of Kashmir was 2,905,578. Of these 2,154,695 were Muslims, 689,073 Hindus, 25,828 Sikhs, and 35,047 Buddhists. The Hindus were found mainly in Jammu, where they constituted a little less than 50% of the population. In the Kashmir Valley, the Hindus represented \\"only 524 in every 10,000 of the population (i.e. 5.24%), and in the frontier wazarats of Ladhakh and Gilgit only 94 out of every 10,000 persons (0.94%).\\" In the same Census of 1901, in the Kashmir Valley, the total population was recorded to be 1,157,394, of which the Muslim population was 1,083,766, or 93.6% of the population. These percentages have remained fairly stable for the last 100 years. In the 1941 Census of British India, Muslims accounted for 93.6% of the population of the Kashmir Valley and the Hindus constituted 4%. In 2003, the percentage of Muslims in the Kashmir Valley was 95%BBC. 2003. The Future of Kashmir? In Depth. and those of Hindus 4%; the same year, in Jammu, the percentage of Hindus was 67% and those of Muslims 27%. Among the Muslims of the Kashmir province within the princely state, four divisions were recorded: \\"Shaikhs, Saiyids, Mughals, and Pathans. The Shaikhs, who are by far the most numerous, are the descendants of Hindus, but have retained none of the caste rules of their forefathers. They have clan names known as krams ...\\"Imperial Gazetteer of India, volume 15. 1908. Oxford University Press, Oxford and London. pp. 99‚Äì102. It was recorded that these kram names included \\"Tantre\\", \\"Shaikh\\", \\"Bat\\", \\"Mantu\\", \\"Ganai\\", \\"Dar\\", \\"Damar\\", \\"Lon\\", etc. The Saiyids, it was recorded, \\"could be divided into those who follow the profession of religion and those who have taken to agriculture and other pursuits. Their kram name is 'Mir.' While a Saiyid retains his saintly profession Mir is a prefix; if he has taken to agriculture, Mir is an affix to his name.\\" The Mughals who were not numerous were recorded to have kram names like \\"Mir\\" (a corruption of \\"Mirza\\"), \\"Beg\\", \\"Bandi\\", \\"Bach\\" and \\"Ashaye\\". Finally, it was recorded that the Pathans \\"who are more numerous than the Mughals, ... are found chiefly in the south-west of the valley, where Pathan colonies have from time to time been founded. The most interesting of these colonies is that of Kuki-Khel Afridis at Dranghaihama, who retain all the old customs and speak Pashtu.\\" Among the main tribes of Muslims in the princely state are the Butts, Dar, Lone, Jat, Gujjar, Rajput, Sudhan and Khatri. A small number of Butts, Dar and Lone use the title Khawaja and the Khatri use the title Shaikh the Gujjar use the title of Chaudhary. All these tribes are indigenous of the princely state which converted to Islam from Hinduism during its arrival in region. Among the Hindus of Jammu province, who numbered 626,177 (or 90.87% of the Hindu population of the princely state), the most important castes recorded in the census were \\"Brahmans (186,000), the Rajputs (167,000), the Khattris (48,000) and the Thakkars (93,000).\\" Gallery Image:Horned figure on pottery.

It is often used like the Sanskrit word ƒÅgama to mean \\"collection\\", \\"assemblage\\", \\"class\\" or \\"group\\" in both PƒÅ·∏∑i and Sanskrit.Rhys Davids & Stede (1921-25), p. 352, entry for \\"NikƒÅya\\" at (retrieved 2007-11-06). It is most commonly used in reference to the Pali Buddhist texts of the Tripitaka namely the Sutta Pi·π≠aka, the Vinaya Pitaka and the Abhidhamma Pitaka. It is also used to refer to monastic lineages, where it is sometimes translated as a 'monastic fraternity'. The term NikƒÅya Buddhism is sometimes used in contemporary scholarship to refer to the Buddhism of the early Buddhist schools. Text collections In the PƒÅli Canon, particularly, the \\"Discourse Basket\\" or Sutta Pi·π≠aka, the meaning of nikƒÅya is roughly equivalent to the English collection and is used to describe groupings of discourses according to theme, length, or other categories. For example, the Sutta Pi·π≠aka is broken up into five nikƒÅyas: * the Dƒ´gha NikƒÅya, the collection of long (PƒÅ·∏∑i: dƒ´gha) discourses * the Majjhima NikƒÅya, the collection of middle-length (majjhima) discourses * the Samyutta NikƒÅya, the collection of thematically linked (samyutta) discourses * the Anguttara NikƒÅya, the \\"gradual collection\\" (discourses grouped by content enumerations) * the Khuddaka NikƒÅya, the \\"minor collection\\" In the other early Buddhist schools the alternate term ƒÅgama was used instead of nikƒÅya to describe their Sutra Pi·π≠akas. Thus the non-MahƒÅyƒÅna portion of the Sanskrit-language Sutra Pi·π≠aka is referred to as \\"the ƒÄgamas\\" by MahƒÅyƒÅna Buddhists. The ƒÄgamas survive for the most part only in Classical Tibetan and Chinese translation. They correspond closely with the PƒÅ·∏∑i nikƒÅyas. Monastic divisions Among the TheravƒÅda nations of Southeast Asia and Sri Lanka, nikƒÅya is also used as the term for a monastic division or lineage; these groupings are also sometimes called \\"monastic fraternities\\" or \\"frateries\\". NikƒÅyas may emerge among monastic groupings as a result of royal or government patronage (such as the Dhammayuttika NikƒÅya of Thailand, due to the national origin of their ordination lineage (the Siam NikƒÅya of Sri Lanka), because of differences in the interpretation of the monastic code, or due to other factors (such as the Amarapura NikƒÅya in Sri Lanka, which emerged as a reaction to caste restrictions within the Siam NikƒÅya). These divisions do not rise to the level of forming separate sects within the TheravƒÅda tradition, because they do not typically follow different doctrines or monastic codes, nor do these divisions extend to the laity. In Burma, nikaya monastic orders have emerged in response to the relative conservativeness with which the Vinayas are interpreted, and the hierarchical structure within the nikaya. Since 1980, no new nikayas have been allowed, and there are a total of nine legally recognized monastic orders in Burma today under the 1990 Law Concerning Sangha Organizations. The largest of these is the Thudhamma Nikaya, which was founded in the 1800s during the Konbaung Dynasty.

January 13, 1732) ‚Äì May 9, 1810) was an American army officer. He served as a major general in the Continental Army during the American Revolutionary War. Lincoln was involved in three major surrenders during the war: his participation in the Battles of Saratoga (sustaining a wound shortly afterward) contributed to John Burgoyne's surrender of a British army, he oversaw the largest American surrender of the war at the 1780 Siege of Charleston, and, as George Washington's second in command, he formally accepted the British surrender at Yorktown. After the war Lincoln was active in politics in his native Massachusetts, running several times for lieutenant governor but only winning one term in that office. He served from 1781 to 1783 as the first United States Secretary of War during the American Revolutionary War under Washington. In 1787, Lincoln led a militia army (privately funded by Massachusetts merchants) in the suppression of Shays' Rebellion, and was a strong supporter of the new United States Constitution. He was for many of his later years the politically influential customs collector of the Port of Boston. There is no evidence to suggest he was related to Abraham Lincoln. Early life Benjamin Lincoln was born on January 24, 1733,In the Julian calendar, then in use in England, the year began on March 25. To avoid confusion with dates in the Gregorian calendar, then in use in other parts of Europe, dates between January and March were often written with both years. Dates in this article are in the Gregorian calendar unless otherwise noted. in Hingham, Province of Massachusetts Bay, the sixth child and first son of Colonel Benjamin Lincoln and his second wife Elizabeth Thaxter Lincoln.Mattern, p. 9. Lincoln's ancestors were among those who first settled in Hingham, beginning with Thomas Lincoln 'the cooper,' who was among several Lincolns who settled in Hingham when it was part of the Massachusetts Bay Colony. Lincoln's father, one of the wealthiest men in Suffolk County, served as a member of the governor's council from 1753 until 1770, and occupied many other civic posts before his death in 1771.Mattern, pp. 8‚Äì9. Lincoln's maternal grandfather, Col. Samuel Thaxter, one of the most prominent and influential citizens in Hingham, became Colonel in a regiment and one of those commissioned to settle the boundary between Massachusetts and Rhode Island in 1719. In his early life, Lincoln worked on the family farm, and attended the local school. He followed his father into government, becoming town constable at 21, and in 1755 he joined the 3rd Regiment of the Suffolk County militia (where his father was colonel) as an adjutant. In 1756, at the age of 23, Lincoln married Mary Cushing, daughter of Elijah Cushing of Pembroke, Massachusetts, whose ancestors were also among the founders of Hingham. They had eleven children, seven of whom survived to adulthood.Mattern, p. 14. In 1757, he was elected the town clerk of Hingham, a post he held for twenty years. He continued to be active in the militia during the French and Indian War, but saw no action, and was promoted to major by the end of the conflict in 1763.Mattern, p. 15. Lincoln was elected a Hingham town selectman in 1765, a post to which he held for six years. During this tenure political opposition rose in the province to Parliamentary tax measures, polarizing the political landscape of the colony. Lincoln sided with the opposition, eventually becoming a leading force among Hingham's Patriots.Mattern, pp. 16‚Äì19. In 1770, in a list of resolutions passed by the inhabitants of Hingham, Lincoln outlined the measures urged by residents towards the non-importation of British goods, and he condemned the Boston massacre. In 1772, Lincoln was promoted to lieutenant colonel of the 3rd Regiment of the Suffolk militia. That same year he won election as a representative of the town to the provincial assembly.Mattern, p. 19. American Revolution With the arrival of General Thomas Gage as governor of the colony in 1774, the provincial assembly was dissolved, but reformed itself into the Massachusetts Provincial Congress. Lincoln continued to win election to this body, and was placed on committees overseeing militia organization and supply, a position that came to be of utmost importance when the American Revolutionary War broke out with the Battles of Lexington and Concord in April 1775. He was then appointed to the congress' committee of safety, and also was elected to its executive council, which exercised executive authority over the province outside besieged Boston.Mattern, p. 20. He was deeply involved in ensuring that supplies of all sorts reached the nascent Continental Army outside Boston, procuring supplies from blankets to gunpowder.Mattern, p. 22. =Defense of New York= In January 1776, Lincoln was promoted to major general of the Massachusetts militia, overseeing the coastal defenses of the state. After the British evacuated Boston, he and Continental Army General Artemas Ward oversaw attempts to improve the state's coastal fortifications, and he was ordered to hold the state's militia brigades in readiness in case the British returned. In May 1776 he directed the state forces that successfully drove the last Royal Navy ships from Boston Harbor.Mattern, pp. 23‚Äì25. Despite his lack of combat experience, Lincoln began lobbying state representatives to the Continental Congress for a Continental Army officers commission, anticipating that the aging and ill General Ward might soon step down. The idea was generally well received, with one representative writing that Lincoln was \\"a good man for a Brigadier General\\" and \\"a man of abilities\\", even though he had not \\"had much experience\\".Mattern, p. 26. While a Continental commission was not immediately forthcoming, Lincoln was placed in command of a brigade of militia the state sent to join General George Washington at New York Town in September 1776. When Lincoln reached southwestern Connecticut, Washington first ordered him to prepare an expedition across Long Island Sound to raid British positions on Long Island. The expedition was aborted when Washington began to retreat from New York after the Battle of Long Island (Brooklyn) in August 1776, and Lincoln was ordered to bring two regiments to join Washington's army as it later retreated northward from New York Town.Mattern, p. 27. Lincoln's troops secured the Continental retreat to White Plains, New York, and were in the main Continental formation during the subsequent Battle of White Plains in October 1776; this portion of the troops saw no action in the battle.Mattern, p. 28. The enlistment terms of his men expiring, Lincoln returned briefly to Massachusetts to take command of new recruits for the coming year's campaigns.Mattern, p. 31. Based on a recommendation from General Washington as \\"a gentleman well worthy of notice in the Military Line\\", Congress commissioned Lincoln a major general in the Continental Army on February 14, 1777.Mattern, pp. 33, 36. Lincoln's first command was that of a forward outpost at Bound Brook, New Jersey, only from British sentries outside New Brunswick. He established his headquarters at the nearby Van Horne House. After months of skirmishing, his post was the target of a surprise attack on April 13, 1777. In the Battle of Bound Brook he was defeated by a much larger force under the command of Lord Cornwallis, barely escaping capture. =Saratoga= In July 1777, Washington dispatched three of his best officers, Colonel Morgan, General Arnold and General Lincoln north to assist Philip Schuyler, and afterward Schuyler's replacement Horatio Gates, in the defense of upstate New York against the advance of General John Burgoyne's expedition from Quebec. Lincoln was ordered to coordinate the activities of the New England militia being recruited for the effort. General Schuyler asked Lincoln, from a base in southern Vermont, to harass the British supply line as the British moved south from Fort Ticonderoga toward Albany. Lincoln's job was complicated by New Hampshire's militia leader John Stark, who categorically refused to put his forces under Lincoln's command. Stark had previously held a Continental commission and resigned over a promotion snub, and had only agreed to serve in his native New Hampshire if he was not under Continental authority. Stark led his forces to victory in the Battle of Bennington in mid- August, while Lincoln's force was still growing. Continental Congress Broadside, 1777 mentions Gen. Lincoln's letter. By early September Lincoln had 2,000 men under his command, and launched several detachments at the British supply line. One of those detachments, led by Colonel John Brown, successfully harassed British positions outside Fort Ticonderoga, freeing American prisoners and even making an unsuccessful attempt to capture the fort in late September. By this time General Gates, who had taken command from Schuyler in August, had ordered Lincoln's force to join him near Stillwater, New York. Lincoln arrived on September 22, three days after the strategically conclusive Battle of Freeman's Farm where Colonel Morgan's sharpshooters killed most of the officers and three quarters of the artillerymen, resulting in the capture of 6 of the 10 British cannons. There Lincoln's militia were to hold the eastern shore of the Hudson River. Lincoln's militia played no role in the American victory at the October 7 Battle of Bemis Heights, since the action took place on the western side of the river, but Lincoln was in command of the American right in the battle. These forces saw little action, which was concentrated on the American left. American forces, led by Generals Benedict Arnold and Enoch Poor, successfully breached the British defenses, undoing the small gains the British had made at Freeman's Farm and compelling Burgoyne to retreat a short distance. That evening Gates ordered Lincoln to perform reconnaissance; the British left fell back as Lincoln and his 1,500 man force probed them, and Lincoln was able to occupy the former British lines. In council that evening Lincoln recommended that the ford at Fort Edward be fortified against the possibility that Burgoyne would attempt to reach it and cross the river in an attempt to return to Ticonderoga. Gates agreed with the plan, and ordered Lincoln's militia to do so. During these movements Lincoln encountered a British company; in the ensuing skirmish Lincoln's right ankle was shattered by a musket ball, much like General Arnold was hit in the leg during his charge during the Battle of Bemis Heights, even though General Gates had already relieved Arnold of command due to insubordination in Arnold's manner of disagreement with Gates' battle plans. Lincoln was transported to Albany, where he was treated, and where he learned of Burgoyne's October 17 surrender. His son helped him return him to Hingham in February 1778, where he convalesced for several months. The injury left his right leg two inches shorter than the left, and for many years the ankle wound was prone to reopening and the danger of infection. During his recovery Lincoln learned that General Arnold's seniority had been restored, reducing Lincoln to the lowest-ranked major general. Although he considered resignation over the slight, Washington and supporters in the Continental Congress assured him of his value to the army. =Southern theater (1778‚Äì81)= The Hon. B. Lincoln, Esq. Major General, Continental Army. Lincoln rejoined Washington outside New York in August 1778, and was appointed commander of the Southern department in September. Washington sent Lincoln, Lafayette and Lee (Henry \\"Light Horse Harry\\") to the Southern Department to oppose the British army under Clinton and Cornwallis. Lincoln participated in the unsuccessful French-led siege of Savannah, Georgia in October 1779, after which he retreated to Charleston, South Carolina. He took command of the garrison of Charleston. In March 1780 the city was surrounded by a sizable British force dispatched from New York. After a relatively brief siege Lincoln was forced to surrender more than 5,000 men to Lieutenant General Sir Henry Clinton on May 12, 1780, but did so in a way that allowed the South Carolina militia to escape as well as some Continental forces, that annoyed the British toward Lincoln. Lincoln, desperate for more troops, had pleaded with the South Carolina legislature to arm 1,000 enslaved African Americans to ward off the approaching British. Rather than see armed slaves, the legislature began negotiations with the British commanders to allow the British forces to pass through South Carolina. The loss of the southern army at Charleston was one of the worst Continental defeats of the war. He was denied the honors of war in surrendering, due to the British annoyance at his facilitating the escape of SC militia units and some Continental forces, such as those with Lafayette and Lee, which deeply rankled Lincoln. Lincoln was paroled, and in the court of inquiry no charges were ever brought against him. The British subsequently sought to enlist large numbers of black soldiers. After being exchanged for the British Major General William Phillips in November 1780, Lincoln returned to Washington's main army. He led a large portion of the Army south from Head of Elk Maryland to Hampton, Virginia, to march to the west to Yorktown where the British were encamped. Lincoln played a major role in the Siege of Yorktown and the surrender of Lord Cornwallis on October 19, 1781. Cornwallis plead illness, and so did not attend the surrender ceremony, choosing instead to send his second-in-command, the Irish General Charles O'Hara. General Washington refused to accept Cornwallis' sword from O'Hara, directing O'Hara to present it instead to Lincoln, Washington's own second-in-command. =Secretary of War (1781‚Äì83)= From 1781 to late 1783, Lincoln served as the first United States Secretary of War. He was appointed by the Confederation Congress under the Articles of Confederation and Perpetual Union, adopted 1781. He was succeeded in the post by Continental Army artillery chief, Gen. Henry Knox, (who later continued in the position under the new Federal Constitution of 1787, with first President George Washington, during his first term, 1789-1795). He was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1781. Post-war politics Tomb of Gen. Benjamin Lincoln, Hingham Cemetery, Hingham, Massachusetts While Secretary of War, Lincoln was elected the first president of the Massachusetts chapter of the Society of the Cincinnati on June 9, 1783, and he then supported the election of George Washington as president of the national Society on June 19.Massachusetts Cincinnati Society‚Äôs webpage, viewed January 25, 2019 In early 1787, Lincoln helped put an end to an uprising of western Massachusetts farmers opposed to increased taxation and government coercion in their trade, known as Shays' Rebellion; Lincoln commanded 3,000 privately funded militia to disperse the opposition, and captured over one hundred. The uprising with the near-capture of a federal arsenal by rebels caused a national uproar, and it was an important part of the national crisis that justified calling the Constitutional Convention. The next year, as a Suffolk County, Hingham delegate, Lincoln voted to support the United States Constitution at the Massachusetts Federal Convention, which ratified 187 to 168 on February 6, 1788.‚ÄúConvention of Massachusetts‚Äù, Elliot‚Äôs Debates: Volume 2, found at TeachingAmericanHistory online On February 4, 1789, Lincoln was one of only 10 men who received electoral votes during the first election for President and Vice President of the United States, receiving the vote of an unrecorded elector from the State of Georgia. Lincoln also served as one of the first trustees of Derby Academy, founded in Hingham by Sarah Hersey Derby, widow of a wealthy Salem shipping magnate. He stayed active in public life in various capacities, including a term as Lieutenant Governor of Massachusetts and many years as the Collector of the Port of Boston. He retired from public life in 1809 and died in Hingham on May 9, 1810. Legacy General Benjamin Lincoln House, where Lincoln was born Lincoln is buried in the Old Ship Burying Ground behind the Old Ship Church in Hingham. Among the pallbearers at Lincoln's funeral were John Adams, Cotton Tufts, Robert Treat Paine, Richard Cranch and Thomas Melvill. In Lincoln's honor, the bells at Boston and other places were tolled for an hour; the flags of vessels, and those at Fort Independence and Fort Warren, as well as those at the Charlestown Navy Yard were lowered to half-mast. He was one of the few men to have been involved in the three major surrenders of the American Revolutionary War: twice as a victor (at Yorktown and Saratoga), and once as the defeated party (at Charleston). In spite of the major role he played during the war, he tends to be less well-remembered than many of his contemporaries in the Continental Army. Places named \\"Lincoln\\" in the American South tend to be named after Benjamin Lincoln rather than Abraham Lincoln, the 16th President (the two were not related). Counties and/or towns in Alabama, Georgia, Kentucky, Missouri, North Carolina, and Tennessee are named in his honor, as are communities in North Carolina (Lincolnton), Georgia (Lincolnton), Vermont (Lincoln), and Maine (Lincolnville). Streets in Columbia, South Carolina, and Savannah, Georgia, bear his name, as does Lincoln Hall at the United States Coast Guard Training Center in Yorktown, Virginia. Lincoln's lifelong home still stands. It was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1972, and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

They belong to the Pancha (five) Gauda Brahmana groups. from the Kashmir Valley, a mountainous region in the Indian union territory of Jammu and Kashmir. Kashmiri Pandits originally lived in the Kashmir Valley before Muslim influence entered the region after which large numbers converted to Islam. They are the only remaining Kashmiri Hindu community native to Kashmir. History Photograph of the Martand Sun Temple, Hardy Cole's Archaeological Survey of India Report 'Illustrations of Ancient Buildings in Kashmir.' (1869) =Early history= The Hindu caste system of the Kashmir region was influenced by the influx of Buddhism from the time of Asoka, around the third century BCE, and a consequence of this was that the traditional lines of varna were blurred, with the exception of that for the Brahmins. Another notable feature of early Kashmiri society was the relative high regard in which women were held when compared to their position in other communities of the period. A historically contested region, Northern India was subject to attack from Turkic and Arab regimes from the eighth century onwards, but they generally ignored the mountain-circled Kashmir Valley in favour of easier pickings elsewhere. It was not until the fourteenth century that Muslim rule was finally established in the Valley and when this happened it did not occur primarily as a consequence of invasion so much as because of internal problems resulting from the weak rule and corruption endemic in the Hindu Lohara dynasty. Mohibbul Hasan describes this collapse as The Brahmins had something to be particularly unhappy about during the reign of the last Lohara king, for S≈´hadeva chose to include them in his system of onerous taxation, whereas previously they appear to have been exempted. =Medieval history= Zulju, who was probably a Mongol from Turkistan, wreaked devastation in 1320, when he commanded a force that conquered many regions of the Kashmir Valley. However, Zulju was probably not a Muslim. The actions of Sultan Sikandar Butshikan (1389‚Äì1413), the seventh Muslim ruler in Kashmir were also significant to the area. The Sultan has been referred to as an iconoclast because of his destruction of many non-Muslim religious symbols and the manner in which he forced the population to convert or flee. Many followers of the traditional religions who did not convert to Islam instead migrated to other parts of India. The migrants included some Pandits, although it is possible that some of this community relocated for economic reasons as much as to escape the new rulers. Brahmins were at that time generally being offered grants of land in other areas by rulers seeking to utilise the traditionally high literacy and general education of the community, as well as the legitimacy conferred upon them by association. The outcome of this shift both in population and in religion was that the Kashmir Valley became a predominantly Muslim region. Butshikan's heir, the devout Muslim Zain-ul-Abidin (1423‚Äì74), was tolerant of Hindus to the extent of sanctioning a return to Hinduism of those who had been forcibly converted to the Muslim faith, as well as becoming involved in the restoration of temples. He respected the learning of these Pandits, to whom he gave land as well as encouraging those who had left to return. He operated a meritocracy and both Brahmins and Buddhists were among his closest advisors. =Modern history= Three Hindu priests writing religious texts ‚Äì 1890s, Jammu and Kashmir Early modern Modern D.L. Sheth, the former director of the Center for the Study of Developing Societies in India (CSDS), lists Indian communities that constituted the middle class and were traditionally \\"urban and professional\\" (following professions like doctors, lawyers, teachers, engineers, etc.) immediately after Independence in 1947. This list included the Kashmiri Pandits, the Nagar Brahmins from Gujarat; the South Indian Brahmins; the Punjabi Khatris, and Kayasthas from northern India; Chitpawans and CKPs(Chandraseniya Kayastha Prabhus) from Maharashtra; the Probasi and the Bhadralok Bengalis; the Parsis and the upper crusts of Muslim and Christian communities. According to P.K.Verma, \\"Education was a common thread that bound together this pan Indian elite\\" and almost all the members of these communities could read and write English and were educated beyond school. Recent events =Exodus from Kashmir (1985‚Äì1995)= The Kashmiri Pandits had been a favoured section of the population of the valley during Dogra rule (1846‚Äì1947). 20 per cent of them left the valley as a consequence of the 1950 land reforms, Quote: \\"Since a majority of the landlords were Hindu, the (land) reforms (of 1950) led to a mass exodus of Hindus from the state. ... The unsettled nature of Kashmir's accession to India, coupled with the threat of economic and social decline in the face of the land reforms, led to increasing insecurity among the Hindus in Jammu, and among Kashmiri Pandits, 20 per cent of whom had emigrated from the Valley by 1950.\\" and by 1981 the Pandit population amounted to 5 per cent of the total. An artpiece of three Kashmiri Pandit women They began to leave in much greater numbers in the 1990s during the eruption of militancy, following persecution and threats by radical Islamists and militants. The events of 19 January 1990 were particularly vicious. On that day, mosques issued declarations that the Kashmiri Pandits were Kafirs and that the males had to leave Kashmir, convert to Islam or be killed. Those who chose to the first of these were told to leave their women behind. The Kashmiri Muslims were instructed to identify Pandit homes so they could be systematically targeted for conversion or killing.Tej Kumar Tikoo, Kashmiri Pandits offered three choices by Radical Islamists, India Defence Review, 19 January 2015. According to a number of authors, approximately 100,000 of the total Kashmiri Pandit population of 140,000 left the valley during the 1990s., , Other authors have suggested a higher figure for the exodus, ranging from the entire population of over 150,000, to 190,000 of a total Pandit population of 200,000, to a number as high as 800,000. The nature of the planned exodus has remain controversial, with the involvement of then Governor Jagmohan in organising a clandestine exodus been a subject of controversy. Many of the refugee Kashmiri Pandits have been living in abject conditions in refugee camps of Jammu. The government has reported on the terrorist threats to Pandits still living in the Kashmir region. Some Hindus across India tried to help the Pandits. Bal Thackeray from Maharashtra got seats reserved in engineering colleges for the children of these Pandits. He was one of the first persons to help them after which Punjab also followed suit. In 2009 the Oregon Legislative Assembly passed a resolution to recognise 14 September 2007, as Martyrs Day to acknowledge ethnic cleansing and campaigns of terror inflicted on non-Muslim minorities of Jammu and Kashmir by terrorists seeking to establish an Islamic state.Senate Joint Resolution 23, 75th OREGON LEGISLATIVE ASSEMBLY‚Äî2009 Regular Session In 2010, the Government of Jammu and Kashmir noted that 808 Pandit families, comprising 3,445 people, were still living in the Valley and that financial and other incentives put in place to encourage others to return there had been unsuccessful. According to a J&K; government report, 219 members of the community had been killed in the region between 1989 and 2004 but none thereafter. The local organisation of pandits in Kashmir, Kashmir Pandit Sangharsh Samiti after carrying out a survey in 2008 and 2009, said that 399 Kashmiri Pandits were killed by insurgents from 1990 to 2011 with 75% of them being killed during the first year of the Kashmiri insurgency. The exiled community had hoped to return after the situation improved. They have not done so because the situation in the Valley remains unstable and they fear a risk to their lives. As of October 2015, only 1 Kashmiri Pandit family returned to the Kashmir valley since 1990 according to the Jammu & Kashmir government despite the financial assistance being given for rehabilitation. As of 2016, a total of 1,800 Kashmiri Pandit youths have returned to the valley since the announcing of Rs. 1,168-crore package in 2008 by the UPA government. =PRC and the JKMIP Acts= There are zones set up with offices for relief. Many Orders, Circulars and recommendations have been issued for relief of Kashmiri Pandits.http://jkmigrantrelief.nic.in/pdf/recommendations_of_inter_ministerial_team.pdf The Jammu And Kashmir Migrant Immovable Property (Preservation, Protection And Restraint on Distress Sales) Act, 1997, provides that \\"Any person who is an unauthorised occupant or recipient of any usufruct of any immovable property of the migrant shall pay to the migrant such compensation for the period of unauthorised occupation and in such a manner as may be determined by the District Magistrate.\\" =Socio-political organisations= Following the migration of the Kashmiri Pandit community, various socio-political organisations have sprung up to represent the cause of the displaced community. The most prominent among these are the All India Kashmiri Samaj or AIKS, All India Kashmiri Pandit conference, Panun Kashmir & Kashmiri Samiti. These organisations are involved in rehabilitation of the community in the valley through peace negotiations, mobilisation of human rights groups and job creation for the Pandits. Panun Kashmir has made demands for a separate homeland for the community in the southern part of Kashmir. Population distribution right According to the 1941 census, there were 78,800 Kashmiri Pandits in the Kashmir Valley. They were distributed into the two districts of Valley, the Baramulla district, where Hindus constituted 2.1 percent of the poulation; 12,919 Hindus out of 612,428 total. and the Anantnag district, where they were 7.84 percent of the population. Scholar Christopher Snedden states that the Pandits made up about 6 per cent of the Kashmir Valley's population in 1947, which is a slight overestimate. By 1950, their population declined to 5 per cent as many Pandits moved to other parts of India due to the uncompensated land redistribution policy, the unsettled nature of Kashmir's accession to India and the threat of economic and social decline. In the 1981 census, the Kashmir Division had 124,078 Hindus, the majority of whom were Pandits. Scholar Alexander Evans estimates by 1990, there would have been 160,000‚Äì170,000 Pandits in the Kashmir Valley. Following the 1989 insurgency, a great majority of Pandits felt threatened and left the Kashmir Valley to other parts of India. A large number settled in the Jammu Division of the State and the National Capital Region of India. Some emigrated to other countries entirely. By 2011, only an estimated 2,700-3,400 Pandits remained in the Kashmir Valley. According to Indian government, more than 60,000 families are registered as Kashmiri migrants including some Sikh and Muslim families. Most families were resettled in Jammu, NCR and other neighbouring states. Religious beliefs Divine Colours of the Divine Spring Ruins of Martand temple Sharda Peeth Kashmir has also been a land of Sun worship with shrines such as Martand Sun Temple established by Lalitaditya Muktapida. Sun worship is believed to have been brought into Kashmir by Kushan kings from Iran. Lalitaditya's predecessor, Ranaditya, is said to have built the first sun temple. Wanvun singing is an integral part of Kashmiri Pandit religious ceremonies. =Pilgrimage sites= Mount Harmukh Harmukh is traditionally revered by Kashmiri Pandits and in 2009 there was an attempt by them to revive pilgrimages to the site. The Mata Kheerbhawani temple shrine in Srinagar, considered one of the holiest Hindu shrines, saw the largest gathering of Kashmiri Pandits in the Kashmir valley in 2012. The shrine is located in Tullamulla village, 24 km from Srinagar in Ganderbal district. =Festivals= The Kashmiri Pandits festivals include Shivratri (or Herath in the Kashmiri language) which is one of the major festivals of Kashmiri Pandits. Navreh or the Kashmiri lunar new year is also an important Pandit festival. Culture A Kashmiri pandit woman, photograph by Fred Bremner, circa ~1900 =Dress= Kshemendra's detailed records from the eleventh century describe many items of which the precise nature is unknown. It is clear that tunics known as kanchuka were worn long-sleeved by men and in both long- and half-sleeved versions by women. Caps were worn, as well as a type of turban referred to as a shirahshata, while footwear consisted of leather shoes and boots, worn with socks. Some items were elaborate, such as the peacock shoes ‚Äì known as mayuropanah ‚Äì worn by followers of fashion, and steel-soled shoes adorned with floral designs, lubricated internally with beeswax.Kaw, pp. 94‚Äì95. There are many references to the wearing of jewellery by both sexes, but a significant omission from them is any record of the dejihor worn on the ear by women today as a symbol of their being married. Kaw has speculated that this item of jewellery may not have existed at the time. The texts also refer to both sexes using cosmetics, and to the women adopting elaborate hairstyles. Men, too, might adopt stylish arrangements and wear flowers in their hair, if they had the financial means to do so.Kaw, pp. 95‚Äì97. =Music= Henzae is an ancient traditional form of singing practised by Kashmiri Pandits at their festivals. It appears to have archaic features that suggest it is the oldest form of Kashmiri folk singing. List of Kashmiri Pandits See also Notes References Bibliography   * .

It creates a complete, professional studio environment on the PC or Mac. Virtual Studio Technology (VST) is an audio plug-in software interface that integrates software synthesizers and effects units into digital audio workstations. VST and similar technologies use digital signal processing to simulate traditional recording studio hardware in software. Thousands of plugins exist, both commercial and freeware, and many audio applications support VST under license from its creator, Steinberg.  Overview  VST plugins generally run within a digital audio workstation (DAW), to provide additional functionality, though a few standalone plugin hosts exist which support VST. Most VST plugins are either instruments (VSTi) or effects (VSTfx), although other categories exist‚Äîfor example spectrum analyzers and various meters. VST plugins usually provide a custom graphical user interface that displays controls similar to physical switches and knobs on audio hardware. Some (often older) plugins rely on the host application for their user interface. VST instruments include software simulation emulations of well-known hardware synthesizers and samplers. These typically emulate the look of the original equipment as well as its sonic characteristics. This lets musicians and recording engineers use virtual versions of devices that otherwise might be difficult and expensive to obtain. VST instruments receive notes as digital information via MIDI, and output digital audio. Effect plugins receive digital audio and process it through to their outputs. (Some effect plugins also accept MIDI input‚Äîfor example, MIDI sync to modulate the effect in sync with the tempo). MIDI messages can control both instrument and effect plugin parameters. Most host applications can route the audio output from one VST to the audio input of another VST (chaining). For example, the output of a VST synthesizer can be sent through a VST reverb effect.  History  Steinberg released the VST interface specification and SDK in 1996. They released it at the same time as Steinberg Cubase 3.02, which included the first VST format plugins: Espacial (a reverb), Choirus (a chorus effect), Stereo Echo, and Auto-Panner.. Steinberg updated the VST interface specification to version 2.0 in 1999. One addition was the ability for plugins to receive MIDI data. This supported the introduction of Virtual Studio Technology Instrument (VSTi) format plugins. VST Instruments can act as standalone software synthesizers, samplers, or drum machines. Neon. was the first available VST Instrument (included with Cubase VST 3.7). It was a 16-voice, 2-oscillator virtual analog synthesizer. In 2006, the VST interface specification was updated to version 2.4. Changes included the ability to process audio with 64-bit precision.. A free-software replacement was developed for LMMS that would be used later by other free- software projects. VST 3.0 came out in 2008. Changes included:. * Audio Inputs for VST Instruments * Multiple MIDI inputs/outputs * Optional SKI (Steinberg Kernel Interface) integration VST 3.5 came out in February 2011. Changes included note expression, which provides extensive articulation information in individual note events in a polyphonic arrangement. According to Steinberg, this supports performance flexibility and a more natural playing feel. . In October 2011, Celemony Software and PreSonus released Audio Random Access (ARA), an extension for audio plug-in interfaces, such as VST, allowing greater integration between audio plug-ins and DAW software. In September, 2013, Steinberg discontinued maintenance of the VST 2 SDK. In December, Steinberg stopped distributing the SDK. The higher versions are continued. VST 3.6.7 came out in March, 2017. It includes a preview version of VST3 for Linux platform, the VST3 part of the SDK gets a dual license: \\"Proprietary Steinberg VST3\\" or the \\"Open-source GPLv3\\". As VSTi virtual instrument technology was under development at Steinberg, a platform for virtual instruments using DirectX engine technology was being developed by Cakewalk, famous for its Sonar DAW. However, the format did not gain much acceptance beyond instruments bundled with SONAR. Currently, almost all virtual instruments on the market use Steinberg's VSTi format.  VST plugins  There are three types of VST plugins: * VST instruments generate audio. They are generally either Virtual Synthesizers or Virtual samplers. Many recreate the look and sound of famous hardware synthesizers. Better known VST instruments include Discovery, Nexus, Sylenth1, Massive, Omnisphere, FM8, Absynth, Reaktor, Gladiator, Serum and Vanguard. * VST effects process rather than generate audio‚Äîand perform the same functions as hardware audio processors such as reverbs and phasers. Other monitoring effects provide visual feedback of the input signal without processing the audio. Most hosts allow multiple effects to be chained. Audio monitoring devices such as spectrum analyzers and meters represent audio characteristics (frequency distribution, amplitude, etc.) visually. * VST MIDI effects process MIDI messages (for example, transpose or arpeggiate) and route the MIDI data to other VST instruments or to hardware devices.  VST hosts  A VST host is a software application or hardware device that VST plugins run under. The host application presents the plugin UIs and routes digital audio and MIDI to and from the plugins. =Software= Many VST hosts are available. Not all of these support VST 3 plugins. * Ableton Live * Acid Pro * Acon Digital Acoustica * Acoustica Mixcraft (VST3) * Adobe Audition * Adobe Premiere Elements * Adobe Premiere Pro * Ardour (open source) * Audacity (free and open source, VST support works on Windows, Mac OS X and Linux) * AudioMulch * Band-in-a-Box * Bidule * Bitwig Studio * SONAR * DaVinci Resolve * Deckadance * Digital Performer (version 8 or higher) * FL Studio * Gig Performer * GoldWave * Harrison Mixbus * iZotope RX * LMMS * Logic Pro * Magix Music Maker * Maschine * Max MSP * MultitrackStudio * n-Track Studio * NOTION * OpenMPT (ModPlug Tracker) * Podium * Psycle (open source) * Reason (version 9.5 or higher) * REAPER * Renoise * Samplitude * Sound Forge * Steinberg Cubase * Steinberg Nuendo * Studio One * Vegas Pro * vMix (VST3 Only) * Vocaloid * Steinberg Wavelab * WavePad Audio Editor Software Stand-alone dedicated hosts provide a host environment for VST plugins rather than use the plugins to extend their own capabilities. These are usually optimized for live performance use, with features like fast song configuration switching. VST plugins can be hosted in incompatible environments using a translation layer, or shim. For example, FL Studio only supports its own internal plugin architecture, but an available native \\"wrapper\\" loads VST plugins, among others. FXpansion offers a VST-to-RTAS (Real Time AudioSuite) wrapper that lets VST plugins run in Pro Tools, and a VST-to-Audio Units wrapper lets VST plugins run in Logic Pro. = Hardware = Hardware VST hosts can load special versions of VST plugins. These units are portable and usable without a computer, though some of them require a computer for editing. Other hardware options include PCI/PCIe cards designed for audio processing, which take over audio processing from the computer's CPU and free up RAM. Some hardware hosts accept VSTs and VSTis, and either run Windows-compatible music applications like Cubase, Live, Pro Tools, Logic etc., or run their own DAW. Other are VST Hosts only and require a separate DAW application. Origin from Arturia is a hardware DSP system that houses several VST software synthesizers in one machine, like Jupiter 50/80 from Roland. Using appropriate software, audio data can also be sent over a network, so the main host runs on one computer, and VST plugins on peripheral machines.  Standard  The VST plugin standard is the audio plugin standard created by Steinberg to allow any third-party developers to create VST plugins for use within VST host applications. VST requires separate installations for Windows, Mac OS X and Linux. The majority of VST plugins are available for Windows only due to Apple's competing proprietary Audio Unit technology being used on OS X (Audio Units is a core part of the OS X operating system). The short history of commercial environments for Linux means few developers have targeted this platform.  Presets  VST plugins often have many controls, and therefore need a method of managing presets (sets of control settings). Steinberg Cubase VST introduced two file formats for storing presets: an FXP file stores a single preset, while an FXB file stores a whole bank of presets. These formats have since been adopted by many other VST hosts, although Cubase itself switched to a new system of preset management with Cubase 4.0. Many VST plugins have their own method of loading and saving presets, which do not necessarily use the standard FXP/FXB formats.  Competing technologies  *Apple's Audio Units *Avid's Avid Audio eXtension *Digidesign's Real Time AudioSuite *Digidesign's TDM *LADSPA, DSSI for Linux *LV2, a cross-platform, open source, liberally licensed audio plugin standard *Microsoft's DirectX plugin *Mark of the Unicorn's Motu Audio System *JACK Audio Connection Kit, an open-source sound server allowing flexible audio routing between apps *Reason Studios' Rack Extensions  Programming languages  Steinberg's VST SDK is a set of C++ classes based around an underlying C API. The SDK can be downloaded from their website. There are several ports available, such as a Delphi version by Frederic Vanmol,. a Java version from the jVSTwRapper project at Sourceforge,. and two .NET versions ‚Äì Noise. and VST.NET;. this open source project also includes a framework that makes creating VST plugins easier and result in more structured code. VST.NET also provides support for writing managed host applications with a managed class that allows loading an unmanaged Plugin. A notable language supporting VST is FAUST, considering that it is especially made for making signal processing plugins, often producing code faster than hand-written C++. In addition, Steinberg has developed the VST GUI, which is another set of C++ classes, which can be used to build a graphical interface. There are classes for buttons, sliders and displays, etc. Note that these are low-level C++ classes and the look and feel still have to be created by the plugin manufacturer. VST GUI is part of the VST SDK and is also available as a SourceForge project.http://sourceforge.net/projects/vstgui Many commercial and open-source VSTs are written using the Juce C++ framework instead of direct calls to the VST SDK because this allows multi-format (VST, Audio Units and Real Time AudioSuite) binaries to be built from a single codebase.

Before recording in Italian in the 2000s, she made records in English in the 1990s. Many of those were international hits. Before her solo career she was the vocalist of Ice Mc. In her career she has sold over 6 million records with 10 top-ten single, of which 4 number-one hits and numerous international sales certifications. She has performed at the Festivalbar for nine times, and four times at the Sanremo Music Festival in which she has earned, besides several music critic awards, three second-places, and has won one in the 2003. Career Alexia in 2008 =Early work= Alexia was born in La Spezia, Liguria, and from a young age regularly entered singing talent competitions. She started working for Italian label Euroenergy (by Disco Magic) in 1989 with the singles (Eurobeat/Hi NRG style) Alexia Cooper - Boy and Lita Beck ‚Äì It's All Right. One year later she gave \\"Backing Vocals\\" in the singles Cinema and Scream by Ice Mc. Later she worked with producer Roberto Zanetti (better known as Robyx) in 1990, as a back-up singer to several of Zanetti's eurodance acts on his DWA label, including Double You and Ice MC and notably featured on many of the latter's biggest hits such as \\"Think About The Way\\" (on the Trainspotting soundtrack), \\"It's A Rainy Day\\" and \\"Russian Roulette\\". When Ice MC left DWA, Robyx turned his attention to Alexia, and the pair wrote the song \\"Me And You\\", which included the vocals of \\"Double You\\". The song was a big international hit and was followed the next year by \\"Summer Is Crazy\\" and \\"Number One\\", which again were international hits. =International success= In early 1997, recording began on Alexia's debut artist album Fan Club with the final international single from the album, \\"Uh La La La\\", preceding it. Unlike her previous singles which were all Eurodance, \\"Uh La La La\\" was a slower pop track and would become her breakout hit, becoming a European summer anthem for 1997, hitting the top 10 in many countries. In early 1998, Alexia officially signed to Sony Music through their subsidiary Dancepool which had released some of Alexia's previous singles in certain territories. After this, work began on breaking her in the UK market and a special remix was commissioned. The resulting Almighty Edit propelled the track into the UK Top 10 and was also a hit in Australia. Simultaneously in Europe, Alexia released \\"Gimme Love\\", the first single from her second album The Party, which saw her begin to branch away from Eurodance towards Europop, causing disappointment amongst some of her fans. Later that year \\"The Music I Like\\" (her first Eurodance single since 1996's \\"Number One\\" was released across Europe, followed by \\"Keep On Movin'\\". 1999 saw the release of her third album Happy, along with the singles \\"Goodbye\\" and \\"Happy\\", with Alexia switching to the Epic label. The album did not have as much success as Alexia's previous albums and her career began to decline outside Italy, with the release of \\"Goodbye\\" in the UK being delayed then ultimately cancelled. =2000‚Äì2001= After five years with Robyx and the DWA team, Alexia released The Hits a compilation of all her international singles, along with new track \\"Ti Amo Ti Amo\\". Shortly after the release, Alexia decided to leave DWA and Robyx as she wanted to expand her sound and audience beyond eurodance. In November 2000, she duetted with Gianni Morandi on his single \\"Non ti dimenticher√≤\\". In 2001, her fourth album, Mad For Music, was released and this was the first album she had co- produced. The album and its two singles, \\"Money Honey\\" and \\"Summerlovers\\", only saw release in Italy but did not meet with the same success in her home country as her previous music had. =2002‚Äì2007= In 2002, Alexia abandoned eurodance and started singing almost exclusively in Italian. She made her first appearance at the Sanremo Music Festival in 2002, coming second with \\"Dimmi come‚Ä¶\\", which was on her fifth album Alexia. Two more singles followed, \\"Non Lasciarmi Mai\\" and \\"Hasta La Vista Baby\\". To satisfy international fans, an English version of the album was released, with \\"Don't You Know\\" (the English version of \\"Dimmi Come\\") meeting limited success in France and Australia. Following this, Alexia's music would be released solely in Italy. The following year, Alexia returned to San Remo with the song \\"Per Dire Di No\\" and winning. The song was from her 2003 album Il Cuore A Modo Mio, which also contained the single \\"Egoista\\". Her most successful Italian album was released in 2004, Gli Occhi Grandi Della Luna, which featured two singles: \\"Come Tu Mi Vuoi (You Need Love)\\" and \\"Una Donna Sola\\". In 2005, Alexia released her second greatest hits album spanning her Italian hits, Da Grande. The lead single from the album Da Grande came second place in the women's category at the 2005 Sanremo festival. After a musical break, Alexia returned in 2007 with a new song, and her first digital download single, \\"Du Du Du\\". Following its release, Alexia left Sony Music. =2008‚Äìpresent= In 2008, Alexia released her first studio album in four years entitled Ale and a new record deal with Edel. The album was preceded by the single \\"Grande Coraggio\\" and later followed by \\"Guardarti Dentro\\". In 2009, Alexia once again participated in the Sanremo festival singing a duet with Mario Lavezzi entitled \\"Biancaneve\\". The song was a big hit in Italy, reaching the top 10 and being Alexia's biggest hit for some time. Following this, a re-recorded version of Ale was released entitled Ale & C, which contained three songs from Ale re-recorded as duets, two songs re-recorded in English and two new tracks. \\"We Is The Power\\", a duet with Bloom 06 was released as the second single, followed by \\"E Non Sai\\". On June 22, 2010, Alexia released her newest album entitled Stars. Only one single, \\"Star\\", was released on June 11. In July 2012 a new single \\"A Volte Si A Volte No\\" was released in Italy. In February 2013 Alexia announced a new version of \\"Summer is Crazy\\" would feature on her upcoming album, \\"ICanzonissime\\". In 2015 Alexia released a new album, in Italian, called \\"Tu Puoi Se Vuoi\\", which spawned three singles \\"Il Mondo Non Accetta Le Parole\\", \\"Sento\\" and \\"Prenditi La Vita\\". Alexia has sold over 7,000,000 albums worldwide. Personal life In October 2005, Alexia married Andrea Camerana, Giorgio Armani's nephew, and in February 2007 they had their first child, a girl named Maria Vittoria.La Gazzetta Italiana Discography References External links *Official Website * RADIO ALE - The official web radio with all her hits Category:1967 births Category:Living people Category:Italian female singers Category:Eurodance musicians Category:People from La Spezia Category:Sanremo Music Festival winners ","title":"Alexia (Italian singer)"},{"id":"399071","title":"Danny John-Jules"},{"id":"399074","text":"Cat is a fictional character in the British science fiction sitcom Red Dwarf. He is played by Danny John-Jules. He is a descendant of Dave Lister's pregnant pet house cat Frankenstein, whose descendants evolved into a humanoid form over three million years while Lister was in stasis (suspended animation). As a character he is vain and aloof, and loves to dress in extravagant clothing. He is simply referred to as \\"Cat\\" in lieu of a real name.  Fictional history  = Television =  1980s  The \\"Cat\\" first appeared in Red Dwarfs first episode \\"The End\\" (1988). The computer of the mining ship Red Dwarf, Holly (Norman Lovett), mentions that after a crisis where all of Red Dwarfs crew had died in a radiation leak, chicken soup machine repairman Dave Lister's (Craig Charles) pregnant cat, along with her unborn kittens, were sealed in the hold while Lister was put into stasis as punishment for keeping an unquarantined cat on board. Lister is left in stasis for three million years until the radiation reaches normal levels. This cat, Frankenstein, is mentioned by the Cat as a story he learnt about at school, describing her as \\"The holy mother, saved by Cloister the Stupid, who was frozen in time, and who gaveth of his life that we might live ... who shall returneth to lead us to Fuchal, the promised land,\\" with Lister realising that \\"Cloister the Stupid\\" refers to Lister. Holly also mentions that the Cat evolved from the cats who have been breeding in the hold for three million years. After reawakening from stasis, Lister, the only known human being in existence, tells Holly to set a course for Fuchal, which is actually the archipelago of Fiji, where Lister had originally intended to take Frankenstein three million years earlier as part of his five-year plan. In \\"Waiting for God\\" (1988), Holly translates a holy book written by the Cat's people for Lister, in which Lister is described as the cats' god \\"Cloister\\", and that his plan of buying a farm on Fiji and opening up a hot dog and doughnut diner has become their idea of Heaven, with Fiji known to the cat people as \\"Fuchal\\". Holly also tells of thousands of years of holy wars fought by two factions: those who believed the humorous hats at Fuchal should be red and those who believed they should be blue. Ironically, Lister had wanted them to be green. Eventually, the two factions formed a truce and built two great space arks to go and search for Lister and the promised land. One of the two arks, following a set of sacred directions (Lister's laundry list, which he lined Frankenstein's basket with), promptly crashed into an asteroid. According to a dying cat priest (Noel Coleman), \\"the sick and the lame\\" cat people did not go on the arks with the rest of the cats, and were left on Red Dwarf to die. Two of these cats were the Cat's parents, a female \\"cripple\\" and a male \\"idiot\\" who ate his own feet. Over time, the rest of the cat people died off. According to Lister in \\"Me¬≤\\" (1988), there are no other cats apart from the Cat himself aboard Red Dwarf. \\"Parallel Universe\\" (1988) shows Holly's \\"Holly Hop Drive\\" trying to get to Earth within a few seconds. Instead, however, it lands the crew in a female- oriented parallel universe with another version of Red Dwarf. Rather than having a female Cat on board, however, this universe's version of Red Dwarf instead has a male humanoid Dog (played by Matthew Devitt). He is depicted as flea-ridden, and having an interest in smelling people's behinds and a fear of baths. In \\"Timeslides\\" (1989), the Cat race temporarily ceases to exist after Lister is seen travelling back in time by entering a photographic slide with mutated developing fluid to convince his younger self (played by Emile Charles) to become wealthy and successful and not join the Space Corps. The hologram Arnold Rimmer (Chris Barrie) unwittingly reverses this new timeline by going back in time to his boyhood self (played by Simon Gaffney), causing the Cat race to come back into existence.  1990s  The pleasure genetically-engineered lifeform (GELF) Camille appears in the episode \\"Camille\\" (1991), and is perceived differently depending on who is looking at her. Camille is seen as whatever the person who is looking at her desires the most, being described by the Cat as what his \\"perfect mate\\" is. The way she appears to the Cat is revealed to be a double of the Cat himself (also played by John-Jules). In \\"Demons and Angels\\" (1992), Red Dwarf is blown up when the beam of a device called the triplicator is put into reverse, putting the engine core into meltdown, while creating a \\"high\\" and \\"low\\" version of Red Dwarf, complete with their own versions of the Cat (both played by John- Jules). Before the lifespans of both versions of Red Dwarf expire after an hour, the crew collect pieces of the triplicator from both Red Dwarfs, and restore the original Red Dwarf by amalgamating the two copies with a rebuilt triplicator. The \\"high\\" version of the Cat is blown up by a bomb the \\"lows\\" throw at him, while the \\"low\\" version disappears with his version of Red Dwarf. In \\"Back to Reality\\" (1992), ink from a \\"despair squid\\" causes Lister, Rimmer, the Cat and mechanoid Kryten (Robert Llewellyn) to share a hallucination, with the hallucinations attacking things they each consider \\"quintessential to [their] self-esteem\\". In the hallucination, the Cat loses his \\"cool\\", and becomes a \\"no-style gimbo\\" with a massive overbite and unflattering clothes called Duane Dibley. The four nearly commit suicide together, but a mood stabiliser saves them at the last second. In \\"Psirens\\" (1993), Kryten explains that Red Dwarf was \\"stolen\\", with the crew now based inside the shuttlecraft Starbug chasing after Red Dwarf to recover it. In \\"Emohawk: Polymorph II\\" (1993), an emotion-leeching \\"emohawk\\" attacks Starbug and consumes the Cat's \\"cool\\", turning him into his \\"Duane Dibley\\" persona. The emohawk is captured, and Lister freezes it with liquid dillinium. The crew plan to extract the emohawk's DNA strands and re-inject the Cat with them to return his emotions to normal, but the Cat clumsily freezes everyone else before this can be done. In \\"Out of Time\\" (1993), Rimmer mentions that all trace of Red Dwarf has been lost. In the episode, a Starbug from fifteen years hence arrives, with Lister, Rimmer, Cat and Kryten's future selves intending to copy some components from the present Starbugs time drive so they can fix the fault in their own drive and continue their lives of opulence, socialising with notorious figures of history such as the Habsburgs, the Borgias, Louis XVI, Adolf Hitler and Hermann G√∂ring. Lister tells the future crew to leave, and the future Starbug fires upon the present day one, apparently killing the crew and blowing Starbug up. In the following episode, \\"Tikka to Ride\\" (1997), Lister mentions in a video log that the future Starbug destroying the Starbug of the present meant the time drive they had used ceased to exist in both the present and the future, or in other words, killing the present crew of Starbug in the present also killed the crew in the future, making it impossible for the future crew from ever going back in time to kill themselves in the present. The Cat later mentions in the episode that time returned to the point before the time drive was discovered. In \\"Ouroboros\\" (1997), a Cat from a parallel dimension (played by John-Jules) is briefly seen, when a \\"linkway\\" through \\"non-space\\" is opened when the membrane between the two realities temporarily collapses. In \\"Epideme\\" (1997), the Cat mentions he brought himself up, and as a result had no formal education. Because there was no one else around, the Cat had to teach himself, and because the Cat barely knew anything to begin with, lessons were \\"long and slow\\", especially on Thursdays when he had \\"double nothing\\". Lister has his right arm amputated in an attempt to rid his body of the Epideme virus (voiced by Gary Martin). Navigation Officer Kristine Kochanski (Chlo√´ Annett) ultimately gets rid of the virus by temporarily stopping Lister's heart and containing the virus in deceased Red Dwarf crewmember Caroline Carmen's (Nicky Leatherbarrow) arm, injected with blood and adrenaline, and tricking the virus into thinking the arm belongs to Kochanski. In the following episode, \\"Nanarchy\\" (1997), Kryten tries looking for his self-repairing nanobots to rebuild Lister's arm. Returning to the part of space where they were last seen, the crew discovers Red Dwarf has been converted by the nanobots into a planetoid made of sand and Holly restored to his old settings and abandoned there, with the Red Dwarf Starbug spent years chasing after being a subatomic version shrunken down and eventually exploring Lister's laundry basket, and the remaining bits they didn't want being left on the planetoid. Kryten orders the nanobots to rebuild Lister's arm and turn the planetoid back into Red Dwarf. In Back in the Red (1999), Holly creates a new set of nanobots to bring the entire crew on board Red Dwarf back to life after Kryten's had gone missing again. Included among the resurrected crew is Rimmer, after the hologrammatic simulation of Rimmer left Starbug. Lister, Rimmer, Cat, Kryten and Kochanski are sentenced to two years in the ship's brig for misuse of confidential information. In \\"Cassandra\\" (1999), the five of them get signed up by Lister to the convict army the Canaries after Holly lies to Lister that they're a singing troupe. In \\"Only the Good...\\" (1999), a corrosive micro-organism is shown eating apart Red Dwarf. Rimmer crosses into a \\"mirror universe\\" where everything is opposite, and obtains the formula to antidote to the micro-organism from that universe's version of the Cat (played by John-Jules), an intelligent professor who does \\"stupid sciencey brainbox type stuff\\". However, upon returning to the normal universe, the paper with the formula on it turns into the micro-organism's formula. Not being able to find anyone on Red Dwarf, a vending machine (voiced by Tony Slattery) informs Rimmer that everyone crossed back into the mirror universe. The machine opening the way to the mirror universe is shown to have been destroyed by the micro-organism, leaving Rimmer stranded and the only crew member aboard Red Dwarf in his universe.  2000s  In Red Dwarf: Back to Earth (2009), set nine years later, Red Dwarf is intact; the human race is apparently \\"virtually extinct\\" in the universe apart from Lister again; Lister, Rimmer, the Cat and Kryten are the only people on board the ship; and Rimmer is shown to be a hard light hologram and the most senior officer on board again; how these have come about and what happened to the micro-organism is not explained. In this special, a female \\"despair squid\\", whose ink causes joy and elation instead of despair to defend herself, causes Lister, Rimmer, the Cat and Kryten to share a hallucination where they believe they are fictional characters from a TV series called Red Dwarf, and their dimension is \\"invalid\\". This leads them to be shown being pulled into the nearest \\"valid\\" reality. They confront the \\"Creator\\" of Red Dwarf (Richard O'Callaghan) on a version of 21st century Earth who is ready to kill off the characters, and Lister accidentally kills him. The four subconsciously realise that they're hallucinating, and they wake up on board Red Dwarf. Kryten and Rimmer speculate that they were able to choose whether or not they wanted to wake up because of the strengthened antibodies of the four from the previous encounter with the despair squid.  2010s  In \\"The Beginning\\" (2012), the Cat deduces that Rimmer's long- dead father (Simon Treves) is continuing to haunt him, preventing Rimmer from coming up with a plan to battle a simulant fleet. The Cat tells Rimmer to let his father go. Rimmer does so by playing his father's message, which he is only supposed to do once he becomes an officer. This proves that Rimmer no longer cares what his father has to say, and is free of this \\"demon\\" inside of him messing up his head, leading to a successful attack devised by Rimmer which defeats the simulants. In \\"Can of Worms\\" (2016), the Cat becomes the host body of a genetically engineered polymorph's eggs after the polymorph disguises herself as a female Felis sapien (played by Dominique Moore) and goes on a date with the Cat. The polymorph reaches the end of her life cycle after implanting the eggs, and Lister and the Cat kill the offspring after the Cat gives birth to them. In this episode he inadvertently reveals himself to be a virgin, and insists that being impregnated by the polymorph \\"still counts\\". In \\"Cured\\" (2017), it is revealed that Cat is a psychopath as he has many of the qualities of a psychopath such as narcissism, selfishness, and an inability to understand other people's feelings. In \\"Skipper\\" (2017), Rimmer uses a quantum skipper to travel to a universe where Lister is kind and hardworking. Here, Lister got put into stasis because he smuggled a pet rat on board, rather than a pet cat. The rat race did not have a religious war when they evolved, but stayed on Red Dwarf, living on most of its decks. = Novels = According to the novel Red Dwarf: Infinity Welcomes Careful Drivers (1989), the cause of the Cat's people's civil war was over whether their god was named Cloister or Clister.  Character  The Cat exhibits qualities of vanity, such as in \\"The End\\" (1988), where his first words are \\"How am I looking? I'm looking nice!\\" In early episodes, the Cat exhibits typical feline behaviours such as licking anyone who gives him food, playing with \\"shiny things\\" and marking his territory, for which purpose he carries a small spray- can in his pocket. While scent-marking, he repeats, \\"This is mine, this is mine, and all of this is mine.\\" He bats his food around when it is served on the table, explaining to his startled shipmates, \\"that is what cats do with [live] food!\\" His extreme self-confidence results in him thinking himself to be irresistible to women. He is originally very self-centred, acting purely without concern when his old mentor the \\"Cat Priest\\" dies, giving Kryten an earring that the Cat hates on the day before Kryten's automatic self-destruct is scheduled and choosing to finish his lunch rather than carry Lister to the medical bay when he collapses. In the episode \\"Backwards\\" (1989), Lister asks the Cat if he cares about anyone but himself, to which the Cat responds, \\"Hell no! I don't even care about you.\\" This behaviour becomes less prevalent as the series goes on. In the episode Cured it is revealed that he is a psychopath because of these characteristics. By Series IV, the Cat becomes less obsessed with mating, and begins to develop a friendship with Dave Lister and Kryten, although he maintains a strong dislike for Rimmer. As he learns to relate to the crew, he stops licking them and marking his territory, and even begins to show genuine concern for others on several occasions. He becomes a skilled pilot of Starbug and develops an ability to \\"smell\\" dangerous phenomena, even in space‚Äî although he does not grasp scientific terms, describing anomalies as a \\"swirly thing\\" in the episode \\"Legion\\" (1993), and in the episode \\"Ouroboros\\" (1997), when asked by Kryten if something \\"weird\\" on Starbugs long-range scan is a \\"wibbly thing\\" or a \\"swirly thing\\", the Cat says he would \\"hate to commit [himself]\\" at such an early stage. Style The Cat is obsessed with his own superficial attractiveness and has an enormous and flamboyant wardrobe, which he couples with an obsession with his reflection and a penchant for preening.Elyce Rae Helford \\"'OK, homeboys, let's posse!'

University Press of Kentucky In order to understand the role, John-Jules studied the 1986 book Catwatching by Desmond Morris, learning, among other things, not to blink while in character. In the first episode the Cat is introduced wearing a pink suit, which Danny John- Jules described as feeling \\"like an old Cab Calloway suit\\".Elyce Rae Helford \\"'OK, homeboys, let's posse!' Masculine anxiety, gender, race and class in Red Dwarf\\" in John R. Cook, Peter Wright, (2006), British science fiction television: a hitchhiker's guide, page 245. I.B. Tauris Concerning his character, Danny John-Jules has said \\"He's probably like a little girl the first time she puts on makeup and says 'Hey this stuff looks good...'.\\" During the first two series, the Cat typically dressed in various 1940s-era suits (often gray or pink, with big shoulders and pocket handkerchiefs). He would also wear Cuban-heeled shoes with most of his outfits. He would also wear suits with tailed jackets and ruffled shirts (most notably cream-coloured or reddish-pink). Over the next three seasons, the Cat began wearing flashier outfits (like a tartan three-piece suit) and more leather and vinyl outfits (with boots). He also began wearing brightly coloured hats and coats, such as his zebra-print coat (later revamped to yellow and black). He began sporting more jewellery and earrings. Starting with series 6 and on through 7, The Cat's wardrobe was drastically simplified (John-Jules jokingly speculated that this was done as a cost-saving measure). He wore a black pvc jumpsuit (often with gloves) with a limited number of coats or suits worn over it. Ironically, he spent most of series 8 either in his prison jumpsuit or his battle fatigues. In other media In the episode \\"Parallel Universe\\", the Cat performs the song \\"Tongue Tied\\", which appears as a dream sequence on a \\"dream monitor\\". The song was later released as a single and reached number 17 in October 1993 in the UK Singles Chart. The artist was listed simply as \\"The Cat\\".Cat  Artist  Official Charts US pilot In the first and second pilot episodes of an American version of the television series, the Cat was played by Hinton Battle and Terry Farrell respectively.

He rose to prominence during the satire boom in the United Kingdom when he was chosen to host the satirical programme That Was the Week That Was in 1962, and his success on this show led to work as a host on American television. He became known for his television interviews with senior political figures, among them the Nixon interviews with President Richard Nixon in 1977 which were adapted into a stage play and film. Frost interviewed all eight British prime ministers serving between 1964 and 2016, and all seven American presidents in office between 1969 and 2008. He was one of the people behind the launch of ITV station TV-am in 1983. He hosted the Sunday morning interview programme Breakfast with Frost for the BBC from 1993 to 2005, and spent two decades as host of Through the Keyhole. From 2006 to 2012, he hosted the weekly programme Frost Over the World on Al Jazeera English, and the weekly programme The Frost Interview from 2012. He received the BAFTA Fellowship from the British Academy of Film and Television Arts in 2005 and the Lifetime Achievement Award at the Emmy Awards in 2009. Frost died on 31 August 2013, aged 74, on board the cruise ship , where he had been engaged as a speaker. His memorial stone was unveiled in Poets' Corner of Westminster Abbey in March 2014.

Frost attended Barnsole Road Primary School in Gillingham, St Hugh's School, Woodhall Spa, Gillingham Grammar School and finally ‚Äì while residing in Raunds ‚Äì Wellingborough Grammar School. Throughout his school years he was an avid football and cricket player, and was offered a contract with Nottingham Forest F.C. For two years before going to university he was a lay preacher, following his witnessing of an event presided over by Christian evangelist Billy Graham. Frost studied at Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge, from 1958, graduating with a Third in English.J. Hughes-Onslow, \\"Sir David Frost\\", The Oldie, May 2014, p. 83. He was editor of both the university's student paper, Varsity, and the literary magazine Granta. He was also secretary of the Footlights Drama Society, which included actors such as Peter Cook and John Bird. During this period Frost appeared on television for the first time in an edition of Anglia Television's Town And Gown, performing several comic characters. \\"The first time I stepped into a television studio\\", he once remembered, \\"it felt like home. It didn't scare me. Talking to the camera seemed the most natural thing in the world.\\"Obituary: Sir David Frost, The Telegraph, 1 September 2013 According to some accounts, Frost was the victim of snobbery from the group with which he associated at Cambridge, which has been confirmed by Barry Humphries.Humphrey Carpenter, That Was Satire That Was: The Satire Boom of the 1960s, London: Victor Gollancz, 2000, p. 207. Christopher Booker, while asserting that Frost's one defining characteristic was ambition, commented that he was impossible to dislike.Carpenter, pp. 207-8. According to satirist John Wells, Old Etonian actor Jonathan Cecil congratulated Frost around this time for \\"that wonderfully silly voice\\" he used while performing, but then discovered that it was Frost's real voice. After leaving university, Frost became a trainee at Associated-Rediffusion. Meanwhile, having already gained an agent, Frost performed in cabaret at the Blue Angel nightclub in Berkeley Square, London during the evenings.Carpenter, pp. 208-9. That Was the Week That Was Frost was chosen by writer and producer Ned Sherrin to host the satirical programme That Was the Week That Was, or TW3, after Frost's flatmate John Bird suggested Sherrin should see his act at The Blue Angel. The series, which ran for less than 18 months during 1962‚Äì63, was part of the satire boom in early 1960s Britain and became a popular programme. The involvement of Frost in TW3 led to an intensification of the rivalry with Peter Cook who accused him of stealing material and dubbed Frost \\"the bubonic plagiarist\\".Simon Hattenstone \\"The Saturday interview: David Frost\\", The Guardian, 2 July 2011 The new satirical magazine Private Eye also mocked him at this time. Frost visited the U.S. during the break between the two series of TW3 in the summer of 1963 and stayed with the producer of the New York City production of Beyond The Fringe. Frost was unable to swim, but still jumped into the pool, and nearly drowned until he was saved by Peter Cook. At the memorial service for Cook in 1995, Alan Bennett recalled that rescuing Frost was the one regret Cook frequently expressed.Carpenter, That Was Satire That Was, p. 261. For the first three editions of the second series in 1963, the BBC attempted to limit the team by scheduling repeats of The Third Man television series after the programme, thus preventing overruns. Frost took to reading synopses of the episodes at the end of the programme as a means of sabotage. After the BBC's Director General Hugh Greene instructed that the repeats should be abandoned, TW3 returned to being open-ended.Carpenter, That Was Satire That Was, pp. 270-1 More sombrely, on 23 November 1963, a tribute to the assassinated President John F. Kennedy, an event which had occurred the previous day, formed an entire edition of That Was the Week That Was. An American version of TW3 ran after the original British series had ended. Following a pilot episode on 10 November 1963, the 30-minute US series, also featuring Frost, ran on NBC from 10 January 1964 to May 1965. In 1985, Frost produced and hosted a television special in the same format, That Was the Year That Was, on NBC. After TW3 Frost fronted various programmes following the success of TW3, including its immediate successor, Not So Much a Programme, More a Way of Life, which he co-chaired with Willie Rushton and poet P. J. Kavanagh. Screened on three evenings each week, this series was dropped after a sketch was found to be offensive to Catholics and another to the British royal family. More successful was The Frost Report, broadcast between 1966 and 1967. The show launched the television careers of John Cleese, Ronnie Barker, and Ronnie Corbett, who appeared together in the Class sketch. Frost signed for Rediffusion, the ITV weekday contractor in London, to produce a \\"heavier\\" interview-based show called The Frost Programme. Guests included Oswald Mosley and Rhodesian premier Ian Smith. His memorable dressing-down of insurance fraudster Emil Savundra, regarded as the first example of \\"trial by television\\" in the UK, led to concern from ITV executives that it might affect Savundra's right to a fair trial. Frost's introductory words for his television programmes during this period, \\"Hello, good evening and welcome\\", became his catchphrase and were often mimicked. Frost was a member of a successful consortium, including former executives from the BBC, that bid for an ITV franchise in 1967. This became London Weekend Television, which began broadcasting in July 1968. The station began with a programming policy that was considered \\"highbrow\\" and suffered launch problems with low audience ratings and financial problems. A September 1968 meeting of the Network Programme Committee, which made decisions about the channel's scheduling, was particularly fraught, with Lew Grade expressing hatred of Frost in his presence.David Frost An Autobiography: Part One From Congregation to Audiences, London: HarperCollins, 1993, p. 382.\\"British TV History: The ITV Story: Part 10: The New Franchises\\" , Teletronic Frost, according to Kitty Muggeridge in 1967, had \\"risen without a trace.\\"\\"Broadcaster Frost rose from satire to friendly interviewer\\" , The Standard (Hong Kong), 2 September 2013. He was involved in the station's early years as a presenter. On 20 and 21 July 1969, during the British television Apollo 11 coverage, he presented David Frost's Moon Party for LWT, a ten-hour discussion and entertainment marathon from LWT's Wembley Studios, on the night Neil Armstrong walked on the moon. Two of his guests on this programme were British historian A. J. P. Taylor and entertainer Sammy Davis, Jr. Around this time Frost interviewed Rupert Murdoch whose recently acquired Sunday newspaper, the News of the World, had just serialised the memoirs of Christine Keeler, a central figure in the Profumo scandal of 1963. For the Australian publisher, this was a bruising encounter, although Frost said that he had not intended it to be.Jerome Tuccille Rupert Murdoch: Creator of a Worldwide Media Empire, Washington: Beard Books, 2003 [1989], pp. 29-30. Murdoch confessed to his biographer Michael Wolff that the incident had convinced him that Frost was \\"an arrogant bastard, [and] a bloody bugger\\".Gideon Haigh \\"Vanity Fair: Michael Wolff's The Man Who Owns the News\\", The Monthly (Australia), March 2009. In the late 1960s Frost began an intermittent involvement in the film industry.

In 1976, Frost was the executive producer of the British musical film The Slipper and the Rose, retelling the story of Cinderella. Frost was the subject of This Is Your Life in January 1972 when he was surprised by Eamonn Andrews at London's Quaglino's restaurant.Big Red Book. Retrieved 13 January 2014. American career from 1968 to 1980 In 1968, he signed a contract worth ¬£125,000 to appear on American television in his own show on three evenings each week, the largest such arrangement for a British television personality at the time. From 1969 to 1972, Frost kept his London shows and fronted The David Frost Show on the Group W (U.S. Westinghouse Corporation) television stations in the U.S.The David Frost Show His 1970 TV special, Frost on America, featured guests such as Jack Benny and Tennessee Williams. In a declassified transcript of a 1972 telephone call between Frost and Henry Kissinger, President Nixon's national security advisor and secretary of state, Frost urged Kissinger to call chess Grandmaster Bobby Fischer and urge him to compete in that year's World Chess Championship. During this call, Frost revealed that he was working on a novel. Frost interviewed heavyweight boxer Muhammad Ali in 1974 at his training camp in Deer Lake, Pennsylvania before \\"The Rumble in the Jungle\\" with George Foreman. Ali remarked, \\"Listen David, when I meet this man, if you think the world was surprised when Nixon resigned, wait till I whip Foreman's behind.\\" In 1977, the Nixon Interviews, which were five 90-minute interviews with former U.S. President Richard Nixon, were broadcast. Nixon was paid $600,000 plus a share of the profits for the interviews, which had to be funded by Frost himself after the U.S. television networks turned down the programme, describing it as \\"checkbook journalism\\". Frost's company negotiated its own deals to syndicate the interviews with local stations across the U.S. and internationally, creating what Ron Howard described as \\"the first fourth network\\". Frost taped around 29 hours of interviews with Nixon over four weeks. Nixon, who had previously avoided discussing his role in the Watergate scandal that had led to his resignation as president in 1974, expressed contrition saying, \\"I let the American people down and I have to carry that burden with me for the rest of my life\\". Following the 1979 Iranian Revolution, Frost was the last person to interview Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, the deposed Shah of Iran. The interview took place on Contadora Island in Panama in January 1980,\\"On Iran\\", (Breakfast with Frost) BBC News, 12 December 2004 and was broadcast by the American Broadcasting Company in the U.S. on 17 January.Gholam Reza Afkham The Life and Times of the Shah, Berkeley: University of California Press, 2008, p. 655 n.17:7 Frost was an organiser of the Music for UNICEF Concert at the United Nations General Assembly in 1979. Ten years later, he was hired as the anchor of new American tabloid news program Inside Edition. He was dismissed after only three weeks because of poor ratings. It seems he was \\"considered too high-brow for the show's low- brow format.\\" After 1980 Frost was one of the \\"Famous Five\\" who launched TV-am in February 1983; however, like LWT in the late 1960s, the station began with an unsustainable \\"highbrow\\" approach. Frost remained a presenter after restructuring. Frost on Sunday began in September 1983 and continued until the station lost its franchise at the end of 1992. Frost had been part of an unsuccessful consortium, CPV-TV, with Richard Branson and other interests, which had attempted to acquire three ITV contractor franchises prior to the changes made by the Independent Television Commission in 1991. After transferring from ITV, his Sunday morning interview programme Breakfast with Frost ran on the BBC from January 1993 until 29 May 2005. For a time it ran on BSB before moving to BBC 1. Frost hosted Through the Keyhole, which ran on several UK channels from 1987 until 2008 and also featured Loyd Grossman. Produced by his own production company, the programme was first shown in prime time and on daytime television in its later years. Frost worked for Al Jazeera English, presenting a live weekly hour-long current affairs programme, Frost Over The World, which started when the network launched in November 2006. The programme regularly made headlines with interviewees such as Tony Blair, President Omar al-Bashir of Sudan, Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto of Pakistan and President Daniel Ortega of Nicaragua. The programme was produced by the former Question Time editor and Independent on Sunday journalist Charlie Courtauld. Frost was one of the first to interview the man who authored the Fatwa on Terrorism, Muhammad Tahir-ul-Qadri. During his career as a broadcaster, Frost became one of Concorde's most frequent fliers, having flown between London and New York an average of 20 times per year for 20 years. In 2007, Frost hosted a discussion with Libya's leader Muammar Gaddafi as part of the Monitor Group's involvement in the country. In June 2010, Frost presented Frost on Satire, an hour-long BBC Four documentary looking at the history of television satire. Achievements Frost interviewing Vladimir Putin for the BBC's Breakfast with Frost in March 2000 Frost was the only person to have interviewed all eight British prime ministers serving between 1964 and 2016 (Harold Wilson, Edward Heath, James Callaghan, Margaret Thatcher, John Major, Tony Blair, Gordon Brown, and David Cameron) and all seven U.S. presidents in office between 1969 and 2008 (Richard Nixon, Gerald Ford, Jimmy Carter, Ronald Reagan, George H. W. Bush, Bill Clinton, and George W. Bush). He was a patron and former vice-president of the Motor Neurone Disease Association charity, as well as being a patron of the Alzheimer's Research Trust, Hearing Star Benevolent Fund, East Anglia's Children's Hospices, the Home Farm Trust and the Elton John AIDS Foundation. He was also recognized for his contributions to the women's charity \\"Wellbeing for Women\\". After having been in television for 40 years, Frost was estimated to be worth ¬£200 million by the Sunday Times Rich List in 2006, a figure he considered a significant over-estimate in 2011. The valuation included the assets of his main British company and subsidiaries, plus homes in London and the country. Frost/Nixon Frost/Nixon was originally a play written by Peter Morgan, developed from the Nixon Interviews that Frost had conducted with Richard Nixon in 1977. Frost/Nixon was presented as a stage production in London in 2006 and on Broadway in 2007. Frank Langella won a Leading Actor Tony Award for his portrayal of Nixon; the play also received nominations for Best Play and Best Direction. The play was adapted into a Hollywood motion picture entitled Frost/Nixon and starring Michael Sheen as Frost and Langella as Nixon, both reprising their stage roles. The film was released in 2008 and directed by Ron Howard. It was nominated for five Golden Globe Awards, winning none: Best Motion Picture-Drama, Best Director-Drama, Best Actor-Drama (Langella), Best Screenplay, and Best Original Score. It was also nominated for five Academy Awards, again winning none: Best Picture, Best Actor (Langella), Best Director, Best Adapted Screenplay, and Best Film Editing. In February 2009, Frost was featured on the Australian Broadcasting Corporation's international affairs programme Foreign Correspondent in a report titled \\"The World According To Frost\\", reflecting on his long career and portrayal in the film Frost/Nixon. Personal life Frost was known for several relationships with high-profile women. In the mid-1960s, he dated British actress Janette Scott, between her marriages to songwriter Jackie Rae and singer Mel Torm√©; in the early 1970s he was engaged to American actress Diahann Carroll; between 1972 and 1977 he had a relationship with British socialite Caroline Cushing; in 1981, he married Lynne Frederick, widow of Peter Sellers, but they divorced the following year. He also had an 18-year intermittent affair with American actress Carol Lynley.W. Lee Cozad, More Magnificent Mountain Movies: The Silverscreen Years, 1940‚Äì2004, p. 219 (Sunstroke Media, 2006). On 19 March 1983, Frost married Lady Carina Fitzalan-Howard, daughter of the 17th Duke of Norfolk. Three sons were born to the couple over the next five years. His second son, Wilfred Frost, followed in his father's footsteps and currently works as an anchor at CNBC. They lived for many years in Chelsea, London, and kept a weekend home at Michelmersh Court in Hampshire. Death On 31 August 2013, Frost was aboard a Cunard Line cruise ship, the , when he had a heart attack and died at the age of 74. Cunard said that the vessel had left Southampton for a ten-day cruise in the Mediterranean, ending in Rome.\\"Sir David Frost has died. Cruise company pays tribute to Sir David Frost\\", ITV News. A post-mortem found that he had hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Frost's son, Miles, died from the same condition at the age of 31 in 2015.

It feeds primarily on zooplankton and possibly on nanoplankton (such as algae and diatoms). The maximum size of male cui-ui is approximately and , while females reach approximately and . The life span of cui-ui is typically about forty years, but the fish do not reach sexual maturity until at least age eight. The cui-ui is an endangered species, and one of the few surviving members of its genus.Truckee-Carson-Pyramid Lake Water Rights Settlement Act: Hearing Before the Subcommittee on Water before the United States Congress, Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources. Subcommittee on Water and Power (1990) The cui-ui population is generally improving in numbers, having attained an estimated population exceeding one million in 1993, thanks to the efforts of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency in analysis of the Truckee River spawning grounds and of the Nevada Department of Environmental Protection and EPA in following up on protection measures. The reason the cui-ui remains endangered (though upgraded from critically endangered in 2014) is the recent history of recruitment variation, illustrating that in many years of the 1970s and 1980s there was virtually no recruitment whatsoever due to unsuccessful spawning in an unfavorable water quality and water flow environment of the Truckee River. The species' outlook is somewhat sanguine, since there is a published recovery plan based on an enhanced understanding of Pyramid Lake and Truckee River water quality, and the adoption of a protection plan by the U.S. Congress.United States Congress, Public Law 101-616 Pyramid Lake water quality Pyramid Lake is the only location cui-ui are found. Pyramid Lake, the second largest natural lake in the western U.S. prior to construction of the Derby Dam, has been the focus of several water quality investigations, the most detailed starting in the mid-1980s. Under direction of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, a comprehensive dynamic hydrology transport model was developedC.M.Hogan, Marc Papineau et al., Development of a dynamic water quality simulation model for the Truckee River, Earth Metrics Inc., Environmental Protection Agency Technology Series Washington D.C. (1987) by Earth Metrics Inc.; the model's name was subsequently changed to DSSAM, and it was applied to analyze impacts of a variety of land use and wastewater management decisions throughout the Truckee River Basin. Analytes addressed included nitrogen, reactive phosphate, dissolved oxygen and ten other parameters. Based upon use of the model, some decisions have been influenced to enhance Pyramid Lake water quality and aid the viability of Pyramid Lake biota, including the cui-ui. The dynamic river model was particularly useful for analyzing Truckee River temperature variations, since the cui-ui often swim upstream to spawn, and their fry are vulnerable to elevations in river temperature. Spawning behavior The cui- ui is potamodromous, and will attempt to ascend the Truckee River to spawn in mid-April. If inflow is insufficient to permit this, the cui-ui may attempt to spawn in Pyramid Lake, but generally with little success due to the salinity of that lake.Charles F Wilkinson, Crossing the Next Meridian, Island Press, (1992) Water releases from the Boca reservoir and Stampede reservoirs are currently (as of 2004) timed to assist the spawning run, although in drought years this water is reserved for the Reno metropolitan area. These releases are critical to successful spawning since low warm flows at the Truckee River delta are inhospitable to upstream migration of adults. Several hatcheries are maintained by the Paiute nation to ensure that such a situation does not impact the long term viability of the cui-ui. These measures have greatly increased cui-ui populations, although it is still listed as an endangered species. Paiute tribe Cui-ui The Pyramid Lake band of Northern Paiute called themselves the \\"Cuiyui Ticutta\\", which means cui-ui eaters. Together with the Lahontan cutthroat trout the cui-ui was an important food supply for the Cuiyui Tikutta and neighboring Paiute bands who would travel to Pyramid Lake to share in the harvest during the spring spawning runs. Subsequent to European American settlement of western Nevada in the 1860s many Cuiyui Ticutta made a living by selling fish, although the European Americans generally preferred trout to cui-ui. Cui-ui were also still important for subsistence, despite Bureau of Indian Affairs attempts to encourage farming and discourage fishing. Following the construction of Derby Dam in 1905 and diversion of much of the Truckee River's flow, the Pyramid Lake fishery declined and by 1930 it was no longer capable of supplying even subsistence food. Although conditions have improved recently, the cui-ui are now managed for symbolic and ecological purposes, and are not a food source.

Brainstorming is a group creativity technique by which efforts are made to find a conclusion for a specific problem by gathering a list of ideas spontaneously contributed by its members. In other words, brainstorming is a situation where a group of people meet to generate new ideas and solutions around a specific domain of interest by removing inhibitions. People are able to think more freely and they suggest as many spontaneous new ideas as possible. All the ideas are noted down without criticism and after the brainstorming session the ideas are evaluated. The term was popularized by Alex Faickney Osborn in the 1967 book Applied Imagination. Origin Advertising executive Alex F. Osborn began developing methods for creative problem-solving in 1939. He was frustrated by employees‚Äô inability to develop creative ideas individually for ad campaigns. In response, he began hosting group-thinking sessions and discovered a significant improvement in the quality and quantity of ideas produced by employees. He first termed the process as organized ideation and was later dubbed by participants as \\"brainstorm sessions\\", taking the concept after the use of \\"the brain to storm a problem.\\" During the period when Osborn made his concept, he started writing on creative thinking, and the first notable book where he mentioned the term brainstorming is \\"How to Think Up\\" in 1942. Osborn outlined his method in the 1948 book Your Creative Power in chapter 33, \\"How to Organize a Squad to Create Ideas\\". One of Osborn's key recommendations was for all the members of the brainstorming group to be provided with a clear statement of the problem to be addressed prior to the actual brainstorming session. He also explained that the guiding principle is that the problem should be simple and narrowed down to a single target. Here, brainstorming is not believed to be effective in complex problems because of a change in opinion over the desirability of restructuring such problems. While the process can address the problems in such a situation, tackling all of them may not be feasible. Osborn's method Brainstorming activity conducting Osborn claimed that two principles contribute to \\"ideative efficacy,\\" these being: # Defer judgment, # Reach for quantity. Following these two principles were his four general rules of brainstorming, established with intention to: * reduce social inhibitions among group members, * stimulate idea generation, * increase overall creativity of the group. #Go for quantity: This rule is a mean of enhancing divergent production, aiming at facilitation of problem solution through the maxim quantity breeds quality. The assumption is that the greater the number of ideas generated the bigger the chance of producing a radical and effective solution. #Withhold criticism: In brainstorming, criticism of ideas generated should be put 'on hold'. Instead, participants should focus on extending or adding to ideas, reserving criticism for a later 'critical stage' of the process. By suspending judgment, participants will feel free to generate unusual ideas. #Welcome wild ideas: To get a good long list of suggestions, wild ideas are encouraged. They can be generated by looking from new perspectives and suspending assumptions. These new ways of thinking might give you better solutions. #Combine and improve ideas: As suggested by the slogan \\"1+1=3\\". It is believed to stimulate the building of ideas by a process of association.Osborn, A.F. (1963) Applied imagination: Principles and procedures of creative problem solving (Third Revised Edition). New York, NY: Charles Scribner‚Äôs Sons. =Applications= Osborn notes that brainstorming should address a specific question; he held that sessions addressing multiple questions were inefficient. Further, the problem must require the generation of ideas rather than judgment; he uses examples such as generating possible names for a product as proper brainstorming material, whereas analytical judgments such as whether or not to marry do not have any need for brainstorming. =Groups= Osborn envisioned groups of around 12 participants, including both experts and novices. Participants are encouraged to provide wild and unexpected answers. Ideas receive no criticism or discussion. The group simply provide ideas that might lead to a solution and apply no analytical judgment as to the feasibility. The judgments are reserved for a later date. Variations =Nominal group technique= Participants are asked to write their ideas anonymously. Then the facilitator collects the ideas and the group votes on each idea. The vote can be as simple as a show of hands in favor of a given idea. This process is called distillation. After distillation, the top-ranked ideas may be sent back to the group or to subgroups for further brainstorming. For example, one group may work on the color required in a product. Another group may work on the size, and so forth. Each group will come back to the whole group for ranking the listed ideas. Sometimes ideas that were previously dropped may be brought forward again once the group has re-evaluated the ideas. It is important that the facilitator is trained in this process before attempting to facilitate this technique. The group should be primed and encouraged to embrace the process. Like all team efforts, it may take a few practice sessions to train the team in the method before tackling the important ideas. =Group passing technique= Each person in a circular group writes down one idea, and then passes the piece of paper to the next person, who adds some thoughts. This continues until everybody gets his or her original piece of paper back. By this time, it is likely that the group will have extensively elaborated on each idea. The group may also create an \\"idea book\\" and post a distribution list or routing slip to the front of the book. On the first page is a description of the problem. The first person to receive the book lists his or her ideas and then routes the book to the next person on the distribution list. The second person can log new ideas or add to the ideas of the previous person. This continues until the distribution list is exhausted. A follow-up \\"read out\\" meeting is then held to discuss the ideas logged in the book. This technique takes longer, but it allows individuals time to think deeply about the problem. =Team idea mapping method= This method of brainstorming works by the method of association. It may improve collaboration and increase the quantity of ideas, and is designed so that all attendees participate and no ideas are rejected. The process begins with a well-defined topic. Each participant brainstorms individually, then all the ideas are merged onto one large idea map. During this consolidation phase, participants may discover a common understanding of the issues as they share the meanings behind their ideas. During this sharing, new ideas may arise by the association, and they are added to the map as well. Once all the ideas are captured, the group can prioritize and/or take action. =Directed brainstorming= Directed brainstorming is a variation of electronic brainstorming (described below). It can be done manually or with computers. Directed brainstorming works when the solution space (that is, the set of criteria for evaluating a good idea) is known prior to the session. If known, those criteria can be used to constrain the ideation process intentionally. In directed brainstorming, each participant is given one sheet of paper (or electronic form) and told the brainstorming question. They are asked to produce one response and stop, then all of the papers (or forms) are randomly swapped among the participants. The participants are asked to look at the idea they received and to create a new idea that improves on that idea based on the initial criteria. The forms are then swapped again and respondents are asked to improve upon the ideas, and the process is repeated for three or more rounds. In the laboratory, directed brainstorming has been found to almost triple the productivity of groups over electronic brainstorming.Santanen, E., Briggs, R. O., & de Vreede, G-J. (2004). Causal Relationships in Creative Problem Solving: Comparing Facilitation Interventions for Ideation. Journal of Management Information Systems. 20(4), 167-198. =Guided brainstorming= A guided brainstorming session is time set aside to brainstorm either individually or as a collective group about a particular subject under the constraints of perspective and time. This type of brainstorming removes all cause for conflict and constrains conversations while stimulating critical and creative thinking in an engaging, balanced environment. Participants are asked to adopt different mindsets for pre- defined period of time while contributing their ideas to a central mind map drawn by a pre-appointed scribe. Having examined a multi-perspective point of view, participants seemingly see the simple solutions that collectively create greater growth. Action is assigned individually. Following a guided brainstorming session participants emerge with ideas ranked for further brainstorming, research and questions remaining unanswered and a prioritized, assigned, actionable list that leaves everyone with a clear understanding of what needs to happen next and the ability to visualize the combined future focus and greater goals of the group nicely. =Individual brainstorming= \\"Individual brainstorming\\" is the use of brainstorming in solitary situations. It typically includes such techniques as free writing, free speaking, word association, and drawing a mind map, which is a visual note taking technique in which people diagram their thoughts. Individual brainstorming is a useful method in creative writing and has been shown to be superior to traditional group brainstorming.Furnham, A., & Yazdanpanahi, T. (1995). Personality differences and group versus individual brainstorming. Personality and Individual Differences, 19, 73-80. =Question brainstorming= This process involves brainstorming the questions, rather than trying to come up with immediate answers and short term solutions. Theoretically, this technique should not inhibit participation as there is no need to provide solutions. The answers to the questions form the framework for constructing future action plans. Once the list of questions is set, it may be necessary to prioritize them to reach to the best solution in an orderly way.Ludy, Perry J. Profit Building: Cutting Costs Without Cutting People. San Francisco: Berret-Koehler, Inc, 2000. Print. \\"Questorming\\" is another term for this mode of inquiry.Questorming: An Outline of the Method , Jon Roland, 1985 Methods to improving brainstorming sessions There are a number of ways that groups can improve the effectiveness and quality of their brainstorming sessions. * Avoiding face-to-face groups: Using face-to-face groups can increase production blocking, evaluation apprehension, social matching and social loafing. * Stick to the rules: Brainstorming rules should be followed, and feedback should be given to members that violate these rules. Violations of brainstorming rules tend to lead to mediocre ideas. * Pay attention to everyone's ideas: People tend to pay more attention to their own ideas, however brainstorming requires exposure to the ideas of others. A method to encourage members to pay attention to others‚Äô ideas is to make them list the ideas out or ask them to repeat others‚Äô ideas. * Include both individual and group approaches: One method that helps members integrate their ideas into the group is brainwriting. This is where members write their ideas on a piece of paper and then pass it along to others who add their own ideas. * Take breaks: Allow silence during group discussions so that members have time to think things through. * Do not rush: Allow plenty of time for members to complete the task. Although working under pressure tends to lead to more solutions initially, the quality is usually lower than if more time is spent on the task. * Stay persistent: Members should stay focused and persist at the task even when productivity is low. * Facilitate the session: A skilled discussion leader should lead and coordinate the brainstorming sessions. This leader can motivate members, correct mistakes, and provide a clear standard of work. They can also be used to keep track of all the ideas and make sure that these ideas are available to everyone. Alternatives to brainstorming If brainstorming does not work for your group, there are some alternatives that you could use instead. * Buzzgroups: Larger groups can form subgroups that come up with ideas when the larger group is stumped. Afterwards, these subgroups come back together and discuss their ideas as a whole group. * Bug list: Group members write down all the little problems or irritations concerning the issue they are working on, and then the group discusses solutions for each of these ‚Äúbugs‚Äù. * Stepladder technique: A method where new members state their ideas before listening to the group's position. * Synectics: A leader guides the group and discusses their goals, wishes, and frustrations using analogies, metaphors, and fantasy. Electronic brainstorming (EBS) Although the brainstorming can take place online through commonly available technologies such as email or interactive web sites, there have also been many efforts to develop customized computer software that can either replace or enhance one or more manual elements of the brainstorming process. Early efforts, such as GroupSystems at University of Arizona or Software Aided Meeting Management (SAMM) system at the University of Minnesota, took advantage of then-new computer networking technology, which was installed in rooms dedicated to computer supported meetings. When using these electronic meeting systems (EMS, as they came to be called), group members simultaneously and independently entered ideas into a computer terminal. The software collected (or \\"pools\\") the ideas into a list, which could be displayed on a central projection screen (anonymized if desired). Other elements of these EMSs could support additional activities such as categorization of ideas, elimination of duplicates, assessment and discussion of prioritized or controversial ideas. Later EMSs capitalized on advances in computer networking and internet protocols to support asynchronous brainstorming sessions over extended periods of time and in multiple locations. Introduced along with the EMS by Nunamaker and colleagues at University of Arizona was electronic brainstorming (EBS). By utilizing customized computer software for groups (group decision support systems or groupware), EBS can replace face-to-face brainstorming. An example of groupware is the GroupSystems, a software developed by University of Arizona. After an idea discussion has been posted on GroupSystems, it is displayed on each group member's computer. As group members simultaneously type their comments on separate computers, those comments are anonymously pooled and made available to all group members for evaluation and further elaboration. Compared to face-to-face brainstorming, not only does EBS enhanced efficiency by eliminating travelling and turn-taking during group discussions, it also excluded several psychological constraints associated with face-to-face meetings. Identified by Gallupe and colleagues,Gallupe, R. B., Dennis, A. R., Cooper, W. H., Valacich, J. S., Bastianutti, L. M. and Nunamaker, J. F. (1992), \\"Electronic Brainstorming and Group Size,\\" Academy of Management Journal, Vol. 35, No. 2, pp. 350-369. both production blocking (reduced idea generation due to turn-taking and forgetting ideas in face-to- face brainstorming) and evaluation apprehension (a general concern experienced by individuals for how others in the presence are evaluating them) are reduced in EBS. These positive psychological effects increase with group size. A perceived advantage of EBS is that all ideas can be archived electronically in their original form, and then retrieved later for further thought and discussion. EBS also enables much larger groups to brainstorm on a topic than would normally be productive in a traditional brainstorming session. Computer supported brainstorming may overcome some of the challenges faced by traditional brainstorming methods. For example, ideas might be \\"pooled\\" automatically, so that individuals do not need to wait to take a turn, as in verbal brainstorming. Some software programs show all ideas as they are generated (via chat room or e-mail). The display of ideas may cognitively stimulate brainstormers, as their attention is kept on the flow of ideas being generated without the potential distraction of social cues such as facial expressions and verbal language. EBS techniques have been shown to produce more ideas and help individuals focus their attention on the ideas of others better than a brainwriting technique (participants write individual written notes in silence and then subsequently communicate them with the group). The production of more ideas has been linked to the fact that paying attention to others' ideas leads to non-redundancy, as brainstormers try to avoid to replicate or repeat another participant's comment or idea. Conversely, the production gain associated with EBS was less found in situations where EBS group members focused too much on generating ideas that they ignored ideas expressed by others. The production gain associated with GroupSystem users' attentiveness to ideas expressed by others has been documented by Dugosh and colleagues. EBS group members who were instructed to attend to ideas generated by others outperformed those who were not in terms of creativity. According to a meta-analysis comparing EBS to face-to-face brainstorming conducted by DeRosa and colleagues, EBS has been found to enhance both the production of non-redundant ideas and the quality of ideas produced. Despite the advantages demonstrated by EBS groups, EBS group members reported less satisfaction with the brainstorming process compared to face-to-face brainstorming group members. Some web-based brainstorming techniques allow contributors to post their comments anonymously through the use of avatars. This technique also allows users to log on over an extended time period, typically one or two weeks, to allow participants some \\"soak time\\" before posting their ideas and feedback. This technique has been used particularly in the field of new product development, but can be applied in any number of areas requiring collection and evaluation of ideas.Kerzner, H. (2013). Project management: A systems approach to planning, scheduling, and controlling (11th ed.). Hoboken, NJ: Wiley. Some limitations of EBS include the fact that it can flood people with too many ideas at one time that they have to attend to, and people may also compare their performance to others by analyzing how many ideas each individual produces (social matching). Incentives Some research indicates that incentives can augment creative processes. Participants were divided into three conditions. In Condition I, a flat fee was paid to all participants. In the Condition II, participants were awarded points for every unique idea of their own, and subjects were paid for the points that they earned. In Condition III, subjects were paid based on the impact that their idea had on the group; this was measured by counting the number of group ideas derived from the specific subject's ideas. Condition III outperformed Condition II, and Condition II outperformed Condition I at a statistically significant level for most measures. The results demonstrated that participants were willing to work far longer to achieve unique results in the expectation of compensation. Challenges to effective group brainstorming A good deal of research refutes Osborn's claim that group brainstorming could generate more ideas than individuals working alone. For example, in a review of 22 studies of group brainstorming, Michael Diehl and Wolfgang Stroebe found that, overwhelmingly, groups brainstorming together produce fewer ideas than individuals working separately. However, this conclusion is brought into question by a subsequent review of 50 studies by Scott G. Isaksen showed that a misunderstanding of the tool, and weak application of the methods (including lack of facilitation), and the artificiality of the problems and groups undermined most such studies, and the validity of their conclusions. Several factors can contribute to a loss of effectiveness in group brainstorming. Blocking: Because only one participant may give an idea at any one time, other participants might forget the idea they were going to contribute or not share it because they see it as no longer important or relevant. Further, if we view brainstorming as a cognitive process in which \\"a participant generates ideas (generation process) and stores them in short-term memory (memorization process) and then eventually extracts some of them from its short-term memory to express them (output process)\\", then blocking is an even more critical challenge because it may also inhibit a person's train of thought in generating their own ideas and remembering them. Collaborative fixation: Exchanging ideas in a group may reduce the number of domains that a group explores for additional ideas. Members may also conform their ideas to those of other members, decreasing the novelty or variety of ideas, even though the overall number of ideas might not decrease. Evaluation apprehension: Evaluation apprehension was determined to occur only in instances of personal evaluation. If the assumption of collective assessment were in place, real-time judgment of ideas, ostensibly an induction of evaluation apprehension, failed to induce significant variance. Free-writing: Individuals may feel that their ideas are less valuable when combined with the ideas of the group at large. Indeed, Diehl and Stroebe demonstrated that even when individuals worked alone, they produced fewer ideas if told that their output would be judged in a group with others than if told that their output would be judged individually. However, experimentation revealed free-writing as only a marginal contributor to productivity loss, and type of session (i.e., real vs. nominal group) contributed much more. Personality characteristics: Extroverts have been shown to outperform introverts in computer mediated groups. Extroverts also generated more unique and diverse ideas than introverts when additional methods were used to stimulate idea generation, such as completing a small related task before brainstorming, or being given a list of the classic rules of brainstorming. Social matching: One phenomenon of group brainstorming is that participants will tend to alter their rate of productivity to match others in the group. This can lead to participants generating fewer ideas in a group setting than they would individually because they will decrease their own contributions if they perceive themselves to be more productive than the group average. On the other hand, the same phenomenon can also increase an individual's rate of production to meet the group average.

The five disciplines represent approaches (theories and methods) for developing three core learning capabilities: fostering aspiration, developing reflective conversation, and understanding complexity. Content =The Five Disciplines= The five disciplines of what the book refers to as a \\"learning organization\\" discussed in the book are: # \\"Personal mastery is a discipline of continually clarifying and deepening our personal vision, of focusing our energies, of developing patience, and of seeing reality objectively.\\" # \\"Mental models are deeply ingrained assumptions, generalizations, or even pictures of images that influence how we understand the world and how we take action.\\" # \\"Building shared vision - a practice of unearthing shared pictures of the future that foster genuine commitment and enrollment rather than compliance.\\" # \\"Team learning starts with 'dialogue', the capacity of members of a team to suspend assumptions and enter into genuine 'thinking together'.\\" # \\"Systems thinking - The Fifth Discipline that integrates the other four.\\" Senge describes extensively the role of what it refers to as \\"mental models,\\" which he says are integral in order to \\"focus on the openness needed to unearth shortcomings\\" in perceptions. The book also focuses on \\"team learning\\" with the goal of developing \\"the skills of groups of people to look for the larger picture beyond individual perspectives.\\" In addition to these principles, the author stresses the importance of \\"personal mastery\\" to foster \\"the personal motivation to continually learn how [...] actions affect [the] world.\\" =The Learning Disabilities= In addition to \\"disciplines,\\" which Senge suggests are beneficial to what he describes as a \\"learning organization,\\" Senge also posits several perceived deleterious habits or mindsets, which he refers to as \\"learning disabilities.\\" # \\"I am my position.\\" # \\"The enemy is out there.\\" # The Illusion of Taking Charge # The Fixation on Events # The Parable of the Boiling frog # The Delusion of Learning from Experience # The Myth of the Management Team =The 11 Laws of the Fifth Discipline= # Today's problems come from yesterday's \\"solutions.\\" # The harder you push, the harder the system pushes back. # Behavior grows better before it grows worse. # The easy way out usually leads back in. # The cure can be worse than the disease. # Faster is slower. # Cause and effect are not closely related in time and space. # Small changes can produce big results...but the areas of highest leverage are often the least obvious. # You can have your cake and eat it too ---but not all at once. # Dividing an elephant in half does not produce two small elephants. # There is no blame.

He is portrayed by actor Michael J. Fox. McFly also appears in the animated series, where he was voiced by David Kaufman. In the videogame by Telltale Games, he is voiced by A. J. Locascio; in addition, Fox voiced McFly's future counterparts at the end of the game. In 2008, McFly was selected by Empire magazine as the 12th Greatest Movie Character of All Time. He is also the inspiration for Morty Smith, the second main protagonist of Rick and Morty. Biography Marty was born in Hill Valley, California to the McFlys, a family of Irish descent. Little is known about Marty's life prior to the first Back to the Future film, except for the fact that he set fire to the living-room rug when he was 8 years old (in a statement of Marty's to his future parents). He met his friend Dr. Emmett \\"Doc\\" Brown when he was around fourteen after hearing that Brown was a dangerous lunatic. Marty, being the ‚Äúred-blooded American teenager‚Äù he was, wanted to go see what it was all about for himself. He found Doc‚Äôs lab and was fascinated by all his inventions. When Doc caught him, he was glad to have someone who liked his work and their friendship started there. In 1985, Marty plays guitar with his group The Pinheads and likes listening to Huey Lewis and the News, Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers, and Van Halen. He is also a talented skateboarder and proves to be an excellent pistol shot, a skill he has honed by endlessly playing shooting games such as Wild Gunman at his local 7-Eleven. Marty is a friendly, easygoing but accident-prone everyman who can sometimes lack critical thinking skills; he is nevertheless brave in the face of danger and can be very quick- witted and intelligent. He has shown some good and basic street fighting skills and often throws punches in hand-to-hand confrontations. He is loyal to his family and friends, regardless of whether or not he is estranged from them. His major character flaw is his pride, which causes him to take unnecessary risks to show others that he is not a coward. However, during a visit in 1885, when his ancestor Seamus McFly mentions that his brother Martin was killed in an argument after someone questioned his bravery, Marty begins to re-think his stance on what other people think of him. By 2015, Marty's life has spiraled out of control due to long-term pain from a hand injury that leaves him unable to play guitar. This injury occurs in 1985, after Marty accepts school enemy Douglas J. Needles' challenge to a road race after being labeled a \\"chicken\\" and crashes into a Rolls-Royce. In 1885, Biff Tannen's great-grandfather Buford goads Marty into a showdown, which Marty wins despite refusing to draw a gun against Buford. Once he returns to 1985, he remembers both this event and Seamus' advice and politely declines Needles' challenge, avoiding the collision that would have ruined his musical talents. This event shows newfound maturity as he often loses his temper when called a \\"chicken\\". Over the years, Marty learns how to make his decisions on his own terms instead of being influenced by others, thereby changing his future for the better. Family Marty McFly is the youngest of three children of George McFly and Lorraine Baines-McFly. He has a brother, Dave McFly, and a sister, Linda McFly. In addition, he has an uncle, Joey, who is serving a prison sentence in 1985 and is denied parole. Marty's secondary entourage consists of girlfriend Jennifer Parker and best friend Emmett Brown, a scientist whom Marty and Jennifer call \\"Doc.\\" There is an implication that Marty is ashamed of his family and does not spend much time at home, preferring to hang out with Doc, Jennifer, or the guys in his band, The Pinheads. However, Marty's relationships with his family changed after he returns from 1955, with him no longer being alienated by his parents and his father working as a local college professor and a successful novelist in the alternate timeline he inadvertently created. Marty also meets his great-great paternal grandparents Seamus and Maggie, when he was stranded in 1885. He also meets their infant son William, Marty's great grandfather. Through his interaction with Seamus and Maggie, Marty discovers that Seamus had a brother named Martin, thus Marty's great-great granduncle. By 2015, Marty has married his girlfriend Jennifer and they had two children, Martin \\"Marty\\" Jr. and Marlene. Aliases Marty has had many false names through the Back to the Future series, usually because of encountering his relatives at some point, most notably Lorraine mistakenly thinking his name is Calvin Klein, due to it being Marty's brand of underwear. In the first film, Marty uses the alias of \\"Darth Vader, an extraterrestrial from the Planet Vulcan\\" while wearing a radiation suit in an attempt to coerce George into asking Lorraine out to the dance. In Part III, Marty claims to be \\"Clint Eastwood\\" when asked for a name first by Maggie McFly and later by Buford Tannen. In Back to the Future: The Game, he uses one of the three aliases; Sonny Crockett, Harry Callahan, and Michael Corleone. References External links Marty McFly on IMDb Category:Michael J.

Any superfluid can theoretically act as a quantum solvent, but in practice the only viable superfluid medium that can currently be used is helium-4, and it has been successfully accomplished in controlled conditions. Such solvents are currently under investigation for use in spectroscopic techniques in the field of analytical chemistry, due to their superior kinetic properties. Any matter dissolved (or otherwise suspended) in the superfluid will tend to aggregate together in clumps, encapsulated by a 'quantum solvation shell'. Due to the totally frictionless nature of the superfluid medium, the entire object then proceeds to act very much like a nanoscopic ball bearing, allowing effectively complete rotational freedom of the solvated chemical species. A quantum solvation shell consists of a region of non-superfluid helium-4 atoms that surround the molecule(s) and exhibit adiabatic following around the centre of gravity of the solute. As such, the kinetics of an effectively gaseous molecule can be studied without the need to use an actual gas (which can be impractical or impossible). It is necessary to make a small alteration to the rotational constant of the chemical species being examined, in order to compensate for the higher mass entailed by the quantum solvation shell. Quantum solvation has so far been achieved with a number of organic, inorganic and organometallic compounds, and it has been speculated that as well as the obvious use in the field of spectroscopy, quantum solvents could be used as tools in nanoscale chemical engineering, perhaps to manufacture components for use in nanotechnology.

The band was founded by the original guitar player Mike Livingston (formerly of The Mau-Mau's) and Kevin Wood on bass. They had previously played together in the band Ella and the Blacks, which also included Brian Grillo and Brendan Mullen (founder of The Masque, the first L.A. punk rock club). Grillo became Lock Up's lead singer. Grillo had worked several years before with Martin Atkins in Atkin's Brian Brain project, and then was known in Los Angeles for fronting Brian Grillo's Wild Coyote Review. The original drummer was Michael Lee, (later drummer with Sylvia Juncosa and with The Homebillies), who quit and was replaced briefly by D. H. Peligro, formerly of the Dead Kennedys and later in Red Hot Chili Peppers. After Peligro left, he was replaced by Vince Ostertag . In early 1987, Lock Up signed a production deal with Third Story Music, which was the company associated with Herb Cohen, by Evan Cohen, who later ran Manifesto Records. Cohen brought the band to the attention of Anna Statman, who was an A & R person at Slash Records. In 1988, Statman moved to a new job at Geffen Records, and Lock Up was her first signing at Geffen, in mid-1988. Livingston had left Lock Up in late 1987. In early 1988, Livingston was replaced by Morello. Chris Beebe on bass completed the lineup that released Lock Up's sole album on Geffen Records, Something Bitchin' This Way Comes, which came out in 1989. The title of the album was based on Ray Bradbury's 1962 novel Something Wicked This Way Comes. Vince Ostertag was subsequently replaced by Jon Knox who played drums until the group disbanded. Following the Lock Up break up, Jon encouraged bassist Tim Commerford and Zack de la Rocha to jam with Tom Morello and drummer Brad Wilk who unsuccessfully auditioned for Lock Up. This line-up went on to form Rage Against the Machine. Most of Morello's guitar with Lock Up is unlike his work with Rage Against the Machine and Audioslave. His solos, in contrast to Livingston's rootsy blues oriented style mainly consist of arpeggios, tapping and overall fast fretwork. Evidence of his experimenting with the toggle switch can be heard in a few tracks (\\"Can't Stop the Bleeding\\", \\"Nothing New\\" and \\"Punch Drunk\\"). The songs \\"Punch Drunk\\" and \\"Half Man Half Beast\\" were featured in the 1991 comedy film Ski School.

When the solvent is water it is often referred to as a hydration shell or hydration sphere. The number of solvent molecules surrounding each unit of solute is called the hydration number of the solute. A classic example is when water molecules arrange around a metal ion. For example, if the latter were a cation, the electronegative oxygen atom of the water molecule would be attracted electrostatically to the positive charge on the metal ion. The result is a solvation shell of water molecules that surround the ion. This shell can be several molecules thick, dependent upon the charge of the ion, its distribution and spatial dimensions. A number of molecules of solvent are involved in the solvation shell around anions and cations from a dissolved salt in a solvent. Metal ions in aqueous solutions form metal aquo complexes. This number can be determined by various methods like compressibility and NMR measurements among others. Relation to activity coefficient of an electrolyte and its solvation shell number The solvation shell number of an dissolved electrolyte can be linked to the statistical component of the activity coefficient of the electrolyte and to the ratio between the apparent molar volume of a dissolved electrolyte in a concentrated solution and the molar volume of the solvent (water): \\\\ln \\\\gamma_s = \\\\frac{h- u}{ u} \\\\ln \\\\left(1 + \\\\frac{br}{55.5} \\\\right) - \\\\frac{h}{ u} \\\\ln \\\\left(1 - \\\\frac{br}{55.5} \\\\right) + \\\\frac{br(r + h - u)}{55.5 \\\\left(1 + \\\\frac{br}{55.5} \\\\right)} Hydration shells of proteins The hydration shell (also sometimes called hydration layer) that forms around proteins is of particular importance in biochemistry. This interaction of the protein surface with the surrounding water is often referred to as protein hydration and is fundamental to the activity of the protein. The hydration layer around a protein has been found to have dynamics distinct from the bulk water to a distance of 1 nm. The duration of contact of a specific water molecule with the protein surface may be in the subnanosecond range while molecular dynamics simulations suggest the time water spends in the hydration shell before mixing with the outside bulk water could be in the femtosecond to picosecond range. With other solvents and solutes, varying steric and kinetic factors can also affect the solvation shell. =Dehydrons= A dehydron is a backbone hydrogen bond in a protein that is incompletely shielded from water attack and has a propensity to promote its own dehydration, a process both energetically and thermodynamically favored. They result from an incomplete clustering of side- chain nonpolar groups that \\"wrap\\" the polar pair within the protein structure. Dehydrons promote the removal of surrounding water through protein associations or ligand binding. Dehydrons can be identified by calculating the reversible work per unit area required to span the aqueous interface of a soluble protein, or the \\"epistructural tension\\" at the interface. Lay summary: Proteins hook up where water allows Once identified, dehydrons can be used in drug discovery, both to identify new compounds and to optimize existing compounds; chemicals can be designed to \\"wrap\\" or shield dehydrons from water attack upon association with the target.Ariel Fernandez.

The Niagara Movement was a black civil rights organization founded in 1905 by a group of civil rights activists ‚Äì many of whom were among the vanguard of African-American lawyers in the United States ‚Äì led by W. E. B. Du Bois and William Monroe Trotter. It was named for the \\"mighty current\\" of change the group wanted to effect and Niagara Falls, near Fort Erie, Ontario, where the first meeting took place, in July 1905. The Niagara Movement was organized to oppose racial segregation and disenfranchisement. It opposed what its members believed were policies of accommodation and conciliation promoted by African-American leaders such as Booker T. Washington. Background During the Reconstruction Era that followed the American Civil War, African Americans had an unprecedented level of civil freedom and civic participation, especially the freedmen in the Southern United States, who voted for the first time and could contract for their labor. With the end of Reconstruction in the 1870s, their freedoms began to narrow. From 1890 to 1908, all the Southern states ratified new constitutions or laws that disenfranchised most blacks and significantly restricted their political and civil rights. All of them passed laws imposing legal racial segregation in public facilities. These policies were entrenched after the United States Supreme Court in 1896 ruled in Plessy v. Ferguson that laws requiring \\"separate but equal\\" facilities were constitutional. William Monroe Trotter, 1915 photomechanical print The most prominent African-American spokesman during the 1890s was Booker T. Washington, leader of Alabama's Tuskegee Institute. In an 1895 speech in Atlanta, Georgia, Washington discussed what became known as the Atlanta Compromise. He believed that Southern African-Americans should not agitate for political rights (such as exercising the right to vote or having equal treatment under the law) as long as they were provided economic opportunities and basic rights of due process. He believed they needed to focus on education and work, to raise their race. Washington politically dominated the National Afro-American Council, the first nationwide African-American civil rights organization.Fox, pp. 46‚Äì48. By the turn of the 20th century, other activists within the African-American community began demanding a challenge to racist government policies and higher goals for their people than those advocated by Washington. They believed that Washington was \\"accommodationist\\". Opponents included Northerner W. E. B. Du Bois, then a professor at Atlanta University, and William Monroe Trotter, a Boston activist who in 1901 founded the Boston Guardian newspaper as a platform for radical activism.Fox, pp. 29‚Äì30.Lewis, pp. 179‚Äì182. In 1902 and 1903 groups of activists sought to gain a larger voice in the debate at the conventions of the National Afro-American Council, but they were marginalized because the conventions were dominated by Washington supporters (also known as Bookerites).Fox, pp. 38‚Äì40. Trotter in July 1903 orchestrated a confrontation with Washington in Boston, a stronghold of activism, that resulted in a minor melee and the arrest of Trotter and others; the event garnered national headlines.Fox, pp. 49‚Äì58. In January 1904 Washington, with funding assistance from white philanthropist Andrew Carnegie, organized a meeting in New York to unite African American and civil rights spokesmen. Trotter was not invited, but Du Bois and a few other activists were. Du Bois was sympathetic to the activist cause and suspicious of Washington's motives; he noted that the number of activists invited was small relative to the number of Bookerites. The meeting laid the foundation for a committee to include both Washington and Du Bois, but it quickly fractured. Du Bois resigned in July 1905.Lewis, pp. 208‚Äì211. By this time, both Du Bois and Trotter recognized the need for a well-organized anti-Washington activist group. Founding Along with Du Bois and Trotter, Fredrick McGhee of St. Paul, Minnesota and Charles Edwin Bentley of Chicago had also recognized the need for a national activist group.Fox, p. 89. The foursome organized a conference to be held in the Buffalo, New York area in the summer of 1905, inviting 59 carefully selected anti-Bookerites to attend. During July 11 - 13, 1905, 29 individuals met at the Erie Beach Hotel in Fort Erie, Ontario, Canada, across the Niagara River from Buffalo. =Founders= The 29 founders who traveled to the inaugural meeting of the Niagara Movement from 14 states became known as \\"The Original Twenty- nine\\":\\"Niagara Movement, 'The Original Twenty-Nine', 1905\\", W.

It set up a number of committees to oversee progress on the organization's goals. State chapters would advance local agendas and disseminate information about the organization and its goals. Its name was chosen to reflect the site of its first meeting and to be representative of a \\"mighty current\\" of change its leaders sought to bring about. =Inaugural meeting location= There are differing explanations for why the group met in southern Ontario and not Buffalo. Although not substantiated by primary sources, it is often said that they had originally planned to meet in Buffalo, but were refused accommodation. Du Bois's writings of the time, however, show that his original plan was to find a quiet, out of the way location for the event, and that the Erie Beach Hotel satisfied his requirements. Researcher Cynthia Van Ness has located contemporary evidence that Buffalo hotels complied with a statewide anti-discrimination law passed in 1895. Van Ness says that the \\"Malby Law\\" (1895) prohibited discrimination in hotels on the basis of color, and The New York Times reported on a successful test of that state law in Buffalo, thus making the hotel legend unlikely. Bookerites had been alerted to the planned conference, but one who traveled to Buffalo to investigate the proceedings did not find any activity.Fox, p. 90. =Declaration of Principles= The attendees of the inaugural meeting drafted a \\"Declaration of Principles,\\" primarily the work of Du Bois and Trotter. The group's philosophy contrasted with the conciliatory approach by Booker T. Washington, who proposed patience over militancy. The declaration defined the group's philosophy and demands: politically, socially and economically. It described the progress made by \\"Negro-Americans\\", > \\"particularly the increase of intelligence, the buy-in of property, the > checking of crime, the uplift in home life, the advance in literature and > art, and the demonstration of constructive and executive ability in the > conduct of great religious, economic and educational institutions.\\" It called for blacks to be granted manhood suffrage, for equal treatment for all American citizens alike. Very specifically, it demanded equal economic opportunities, in the rural districts of the South, where many blacks were trapped by sharecropping in a kind of indentured servitude to whites. This resulted in \\"virtual slavery\\". The Niagara Movement wanted all African Americans in the South to have the ability to \\"earn a decent living\\". Women at the 1906 Niagara Movement Conference at Harpers Ferry: Mrs. Gertrude Wright Morgan (seated) and (left to right) Mrs. O.M. Waller, Mrs. H.F.M. Murray, Mrs. Mollie Lewis Kelan, Mrs. Ida D. Bailey, Miss Sadie Shorter, and Mrs. Charlotte Hershaw. On the subject of education, the authors declared that not only should it be free, but it should also be made compulsory. Higher education, they declared, should be governed independently of class or race, and they demanded action to be taken to improve \\"high school facilities.\\" This they emphasized: \\"either the United States will destroy ignorance, or ignorance will destroy the United States.\\" They demanded for judges to be selected independently of their race, and for convicted criminals, white or black, to be given equal punishments for their respective crimes. In his address to the nation, W. E. B. Du Bois stated, \\"We are not more lawless than the white race; we [are] more often arrested, convicted and mobbed. We want justice, even for criminals and outlaws.\\" He called for the abolition of the convict lease system. Established after the Civil War before southern states built prisons, convicts were leased out to work as cheap laborers for \\"railway contractors, mining companies and those who farm large plantations.\\" Southern states had passed laws targeting blacks and leasing them out to pay off fines or fees they could not manage. The system continued, earning money for local jurisdictions and the state from leasing out prisoners. There was little oversight, and many prisoners were abused and worked to death.Douglas Blackmon, Slavery by Another Name Urging a return to the faith of \\"our fathers,\\" the declaration appealed for every person to be considered equal and free. The declaration also targeted the treatment blacks received from labor unions, often oppressed and not fully protected by their employers nor granted a permanent employment. It validated the already announced affirmation that such protest against outright injustice would not cease until such discrimination did. Secondly, Du Bois and Trotter stated the irrationality of discriminating based on one's \\"physical peculiarities\\", whether it be place of birth or color of skin. Perhaps one's ignorance, or immorality, poverty or diseases are legitimate excuses, but not the matters over which individuals have no control. Near its end, the document condemns the Jim Crow laws, the rejection of blacks for enlistment in the Navy and by the military academies, the non-enforcement of the 13th, 14th and 15th Amendments protecting the rights of blacks, and the \\"unchristian\\" behaviors of churches that segregate and show prejudice to their black brothers. The Declaration thanked those who \\"stand for equality\\" and the advancement of this cause. =Opposition= Booker T. Washington, 1903 portrait Booker T. Washington and his supporters tried to discourage growth of this rival movement. Washington, Thomas Fortune, and Charles Anderson met after learning of the Movement's formation, and agreed to suppress news of it in the black press.Fox, p. 92. They acquired supporters in Archibald Grimk√© and Kelly Miller, two moderates who had been friendly with Trotter, but had not been invited by Du Bois to the convention (Grimk√© was hired by Fortune's New York Age). The Age editorialized that the Movement was little more than an attempt to tear down the house that Washington had labored to set up.Fox, p. 95. A Boston supporter of Washington convinced the printer of Trotter's Guardian to withdraw his services, but Trotter managed to continue printing anyway.Fox, p. 97. Prominent white activists, including Francis Jackson Garrison and Oswald Garrison Villard (sons of abolitionist William Lloyd Garrison, a hero of Trotter), refused to attend Trotter-organized commemorations of their father's birth centennial.Fox, p. 99. They chose a celebration organized by Bookerites.Fox, p. 100. Despite Washington's attempts at suppression, Du Bois reported at the end of 1905 that a number of black publications had published accounts of the Movement's activities, and it received further publicity as a consequence of Bookerite press attacks against it.Rudwick, pp. 180‚Äì181. Washington also attacked the Constitution League, a multi-racial civil rights group that was also opposed to his accommodationist policies. The Movement made common cause with this organization.Rudwick, pp. 183‚Äì185. Activities After the initial meeting, delegates returned to their home territories to establish local chapters. By mid-September 1905, they had established chapters in 21 states, and the organization had 170 members by year's end. Du Bois founded a magazine, the Moon, in an attempt to establish an official mouthpiece for the organization. Due to lack of funding, it failed after a few months of publication.Fox, p. 101 A second publication, The Horizon, was started in 1907 and survived until 1910.Rudwick, p. 190.Rudwick, p. 198. Niagara Movement leaders W. E. B. Du Bois (seated), and (left to right) J. R. Clifford (who organized the 2nd meeting), L. M. Hershaw, and F. H. M. Murray at Harpers Ferry. The movement's second meeting, the first to be held on U.S. soil, took place at Harpers Ferry, West Virginia, the site of abolitionist John Brown's 1859 raid. The three-day gathering, from August 15 to 18, 1906, took place at the campus of Storer College (now part of Harpers Ferry National Historical Park). Convention attendees discussed how to secure civil rights for African Americans, and the meeting was later described by Du Bois as \\"one of the greatest meetings that American Negroes ever held.\\" Attendees walked from Storer College to the nearby Murphy Family farm, relocation site of the historic fort where John Brown's quest to end slavery reached its bloody climax. Once there they removed their shoes and socks to honor the hallowed ground and participated in a ceremony of remembrance. Several of the organization's chapters made substantive contributions to the advance of civil rights in 1906. The Massachusetts chapter successfully lobbied against state legislation for the segregation of railroad cars, but was unable to stop the state from helping to fund the Jamestown Exposition, a commemoration of the founding of racially motivated Jamestown, Virginia, in which Virginia sought to limit black admission. The Illinois chapter convinced Chicago theater critics to ignore a production of The Clansman.Rudwick, p. 187. During the early months of 1906 friction began to develop between Du Bois and Trotter over the admission of women to the organization. Du Bois supported the idea, and Trotter opposed it, but eventually relented, and the matter was smoothed over during the 1906 meeting.Fox, p. 103. Their division became more significant when Trotter split with longtime supporter and Movement member Clement Morgan over Massachusetts politics and control of the local Movement chapter, with Du Bois siding with the latter.Fox, pp. 104‚Äì106. When the Movement met in Boston in 1907 Du Bois not only admitted Grimk√© and Miller to the organization, he reappointed Morgan to a leading position in the organization.Fox, p. 108. Further attempts to heal the rift failed, and Trotter then resigned from the Movement.Fox, pp. 109‚Äì110. In 1906 there were several proposals floated in the black press that the Movement be merged with other organizations. None of these proposals got off the ground, with the only substance being a meeting between the Movement's Washington, DC chapter and members of the Bookerite National Afro-American Council.Rudwick, pp. 187‚Äì189. Delegates to the Niagara Movement meeting in Boston, Massachusetts in 1907 The Movement, in conjunction with the Constitution League (which took Du Bois on as a director), began organizing legal challenges to segregationist laws in early 1907. For an organization with a limited budget, this was an expensive proposition: the single case they mounted challenging Virginia's railroad segregation law put the organization into debt. Du Bois had sought to return to Harpers Ferry for the 1907 annual meeting, but Storer College refused to grant them permission, claiming the group's presence in 1906 had been followed by financial and political pressure from its supporters to distance itself from them. The 1907 meeting was held in Boston, with conflicting attendance reports. Du Bois claimed 800 attendees, while the Bookerite Washington Bee claimed only about 100 in attendance.Rudwick, p. 191. The convention published an \\"Address to the World\\" in which it called on African-Americans not to vote for Republican Party candidates in the 1908 presidential election, citing President Theodore Roosevelt's support for Jim Crow laws.Rudwick, p. 192. End of the Movement William Monroe Trotter's departure after the 1907 meeting had a serious negative impact on the organization, as did disagreements about which party to support in the 1908 election. Du Bois, with some reluctance, endorsed Democratic Party candidate William Jennings Bryan, but many African-Americans could not bring themselves to break from the Republicans, and William Howard Taft won the election, receiving significant African-American support.Rudwick, pp. 194‚Äì195. The 1908 annual meeting, held in Oberlin, Ohio, was a much smaller affair, and exposed disunity and apathy within the group at both local and national levels.Rudwick, pp. 195‚Äì198. Du Bois invited Mary White Ovington, a settlement worker and socialist he had met in 1904, to address the organization. She was the only white woman to be so honored. By 1908 Washington and his supporters successfully made serious inroads with the press (both white and black), and the Oberlin meeting received almost no coverage.Rudwick, p. 196. Believing the Movement to be \\"practically dead\\", Washington also prepared an obituary of the organization for the New York Age to publish. In 1909, chapter activities continued to dwindle, membership dropped, and the annual meeting (held at Sea Isle City, New Jersey) was a small affair that again received no significant press. It was to be the organization's last meeting.Rudwick, p. 197. Legacy In the wake of the Springfield Race Riot of 1908, a major race riot in Springfield, Illinois in August 1908; a number of prominent white civil rights activists called for a major conference on race relations. Held in New York City in early 1909, the conference laid the foundation for the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), which was formally established in 1910. In 1911, Du Bois (who was appointed the NAACP's director of publications) recommended that the remaining membership of the Niagara Movement support the NAACP's activities. William Monroe Trotter attended the 1909 conference, but did not join the NAACP; he instead led other small activist civil rights organizations and continued to publish the Guardian until his death in 1934.Fox, pp. 128‚Äì130, 260‚Äì270. The Niagara Movement did not appear to be very popular with the majority of the African-American population, especially in the South. Booker T. Washington, at the height of the Movement's activities in 1905 and 1906, spoke to large and approving crowds across much of the country.Norrell, pp. 331‚Äì336. The 1906 Atlanta Race Riot hurt Washington's popularity, giving the Niagarans fuel for their attacks on him.Norrell, pp. 338‚Äì347. However, given that Washington and the Niagarans agreed on strategy (opposition to Jim Crow laws and support of equal protection and civil rights) but disagreed on tactics, a reconciliation between the factions began after Washington died in 1915.Norrell, p. 422. The NAACP went on to become the leading African-American civil rights organization of the 20th century.

Art of Colonial Latin America (London: Phaidon Press 2005): 402-05. The Panama-California Exposition of 1915 in San Diego, highlighting the work of architect Bertram Goodhue, is credited with giving the style national exposure. Embraced principally in California and Florida, the Spanish Colonial Revival movement enjoyed its greatest popularity between 1915 and 1931. Today, tract home design in Southern California and Florida largely descends from the early movement. The iconic terracotta shingles and stucco walls have been standard design of new construction in these regions from the 1970s to present. Development of style =Mediterranean Revival= Spanish Colonial Revival style residence Lighthouse of La Serena, Chile, was built in 1950 as part of Gabriel Gonz√°lez Videla's Plan Serena that introduced a neocolonial theme to the city centre The antecedents of the Spanish Colonial Revival Style can be traced to the Mediterranean Revival architectural style. For St. Augustine, Florida (a former Spanish colony), three northeastern architects, New Yorkers John Carr√®re and Thomas Hastings of Carr√®re and Hastings and Bostonian Franklin W. Smith, designed grand, elaborately detailed hotels in the Mediterranean Revival and Spanish Revival styles in the 1880s. With the advent of the Ponce de Leon Hotel (Carr√®re and Hastings, 1882), the Alcazar Hotel (Carr√®re and Hastings, 1887) and the Casa Monica Hotel (later Hotel Cordova) (Franklin W. Smith, 1888) thousands of winter visitors to 'the Sunshine State' began to experience the charm and romance of Spanish influenced architecture. These three hotels were influenced not only by the centuries-old buildings remaining from the Spanish rule in St. Augustine but also by The Old City House, constructed in 1873 and still standing, an excellent example of early Spanish Colonial Revival architecture. =Mission Revival= Kelso Hotel and Depot; Mojave Desert, Southern California The possibilities of the Spanish Colonial Revival Style were brought to the attention of architects attending late 19th and early 20th centuries international expositions. For example, California's Mission Revival style Pavilion in white stucco at the World's Columbian Exposition of 1893 in Chicago, and the Mission Inn, along with the Electric Tower of the Pan- American Exposition in Buffalo in 1900 introduced the potential of Spanish Colonial Revival. They also integrated porticoes, pediments and colonnades influenced by Beaux Arts classicism as well. =Florida= By the early years of the 1910s, architects in Florida had begun to work in a Spanish Colonial Revival style. Frederick H. Trimble's Farmer's Bank in Vero Beach, completed in 1914, is a fully mature early example of the style. The city of St. Cloud, Florida, espoused the style both for homes and commercial structures and has a fine collection of subtle stucco buildings reminiscent of colonial Mexico. Many of these were designed by architectural partners Ida Annah Ryan and Isabel Roberts. Another significant example of the emerging popularity of Spanish Colonial Revival can be seen in the architecture of south Florida's Coral Gables, a planned city established in the 1920s that prominently incorporates the style. =California= Santa Barbara County Courthouse is regarded as a prime example of Spanish Colonial Revival architecture The major location of design and construction in the Spanish Colonial Revival style was California, especially in the coastal cities. In 1915 the San Diego Panama- California Exposition, with architects Bertram Goodhue and Carleton Winslow Sr., popularized the style in the state and nation. It is best exemplified in the California Quadrangle, built as the grand entrance to that Exposition. In the early 1920s, architect Lilian Jeannette Rice designed the style in the development of the town of Rancho Santa Fe in San Diego County. The city of Santa Barbara adopted the style to give it a unified Spanish character after widespread destruction in the 1925 Santa Barbara earthquake. The County Courthouse, designed by William Mooser III, is a prime example. Real estate developer Ole Hanson favored the Spanish Colonial Revival style in his founding and development of San Clemente, California in 1928. The Pasadena City Hall by John Bakewell, Jr. and Arthur Brown, Jr. , the Sonoma City Hall, and the Beverly Hills City Hall by Harry G. Koerner and William J. Gage are other notable civic examples in California. Between 1922 and 1931, architect Robert H. Spurgeon constructed 32 Spanish colonial revival houses in Riverside and many of them have been preserved. =Mexico= companion building (1940s) to the colonial Mexico City palace of the ayuntamiento (1720s) INBA- catalogued house built in the colonial californiano style in Lomas de Chapultepec, Mexico City. Pasaje Polanco along Avenida Presidente Masaryk in the Polanquito, Polanco, Mexico City (1938), colonial californiano-style The Spanish Colonial Revival of Mexico has a distinct origin from the style developed in the United States. Following the Mexican Revolution, there was a wave of nationalism that emphasized national culture, including in architecture. The neocolonial style arose as a response to European eclecticism (favored during the Porfiriato). The 1915 book La patria y la arquitectura nacional by Federico Mariscal was influential in advocating viceregal architecture as integral to national identity. During the government of President Venustiano Carranza (serving 1917 to 1920), tax exemptions were offered to those that built houses in a colonial style. In the early 1920s there was a surge of houses built with Plateresque elements; such as grotesques, pinnacles and mixtilinear arches. Secretary of Education Jos√© Vasconcelos (who shaped the cultural philosophy of the post-Revolution government) was an active promoter of neocolonial architecture. Traditional materials such as tezontle, cantera and Talavera tiles were incorporated into neocolonial buildings. The colonial-era National Palace was significantly altered between 1926 and 1929: the addition of a third floor and changes to the facade. The modifications were done in a manner corresponding to the original style. Similarly, the colonial Mexico City government building was remodeled in the 1920s and a neocolonial companion building was built in the 1940s. Colonial californiano The style, as developed in the United States, came full circle to its geographic point of inspiration as in the late 1930s, single-family houses were built in Mexico City's then-new upscale neighborhoods in what is known in Mexico as colonial californiano (Californian Colonial). That is, a Mexican reinterpretation of the California interpretation of Spanish Colonial Revival. Many houses of this style can still be seen in the Colonia N√°poles, Condesa, Polanco and Lomas de Chapultepec areas of Mexico City, and the Pasaje Polanco shopping court is an outstanding example of its application in commercial architecture. =Philippines= Gota de Leche Building in Manila. After colonial rule by Spain for over 300 years, and for the most part being administered under the province of New Spain (Mexico), the Philippines received Iberian and Latin- American influences in its architecture. By the time the United States conquered the Philippines, the Mission-style and Spanish Colonial Revival architecture also arrived, with inspirations from California. American architects further developed this style in the Philippines, given the Philippines' Spanish heritage, but at the same time modernizing the buildings with American amenities. The best example of the Spanish Colonial Revival architecture and California mission style is the famed Manila Hotel designed by William E. Parsons and built in 1909. Other examples exist throughout the country such as Gota de Leche, Paco Market, and thousands more, especially in the churches and cathedrals throughout the country. =Australia= Influential Australian architects such as Emil Sodersten and Professor Leslie Wilkinson brought back styles from Italy and Spain in the early 20th century, convinced that Mediterranean styles would be well-suited for the Australian climate and lifestyle. Mediterranean style became popular in places like Sydney suburbs Manly and Bondi in the 1920s and 1930s. One variant, known as Spanish Mission or Hollywood Spanish, became popular as Australians saw films of and read in magazines about the glamorous mansions in that style that Hollywood movie stars had. Spanish mission houses began to appear in the wealthier suburbs, the most famous being Boomerang, at Elizabeth Bay. The Plaza Theatre in Sydney is a celebrated cinema in the style. =China= In the 1930s, numerous houses in Spanish Revival style were built in Shanghai, particularly in the former French Concession. Although Shanghai was not culturally linked to the Spanish-speaking world, these buildings were probably inspired by Hollywood movies, which were highly influential in the city at the time. Local architectural magazines of the period like The Chinese Architect and The Builder regularly printed detailed examples of the style for local builders to copy and implement. Design elements The Woodward Condominium (built 1910) in Washington, D.C. Spanish Colonial Revival architecture shares some elements with the earlier Mission Revival style derived from the architecture of the California missions, and Pueblo Revival style from the traditional Puebloan peoples in New Mexico. Both precedents were popularized in the Western United States by the Fred Harvey and his Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway Depots and Hotels. The Spanish Colonial Revival style is also influenced by the American Craftsman style and Arts and Crafts Movement. Spanish Colonial Revival architecture is characterized by a combination of detail from several eras of Spanish Baroque, Spanish Colonial, Moorish Revival and Mexican Churrigueresque architecture, the style is marked by the prodigious use of smooth plaster (stucco) wall and chimney finishes, low- pitched clay tile, shed, or flat roofs, and terracotta or cast concrete ornaments. Other characteristics typically include small porches or balconies, Roman or semi-circular arcades and fenestration, wood casement or tall, double‚Äìhung windows, canvas awnings, and decorative iron trim. Notable architects One of the most accomplished architects of the style was George Washington Smith who practiced during the 1920s in Santa Barbara, California. His own residences El Hogar (1916, a.k.a. Casa Dracaena) and Casa del Greco (1920) brought him commissions from local society in Montecito and Santa Barbara. An example landmark house he designed is the Steedman estate Casa del Herrero in Montecito, now a registered National Historic Landmark and restored historic house‚Äîlandscape museum. Other examples are the Jackling House and Lobero Theatre also in California. =In California= Bertram Goodhue and Carleton Winslow initiated the style as the dominant historical regional style in California; they also influenced Hawaiian architecture in the 1920s.

Early life  His ancestry is unknown and there are no records of the time found regarding his birth. Per author Charles Edward Banks, a clue to his identity may exist in the following: a Francis, son of Thomas Cooke, was baptized 6 April 1572, at Biddenden, Kent. There was a considerable foreign French and Walloon colony in Canterbury (Kent). Banks also states that he may have been born in England of foreign parents and returned to Holland in 1603, six years before the arrival of the Robinson Pilgrims.Charles Edward Banks, The English Ancestry and Homes of the Pilgrim Fathers: who came to Plymouth on the Mayflower in 1620, the Fortune in 1621, and the Anne and the Little James in 1623 (Baltimore, MD.:Genealogical Publishing Co., 2006) p. 48. Banks and author Eugene Aubrey Stratton had differing views of the time of his birth. Per Stratton, he was probably born no earlier than 1583, and may have been under age sixty when his name appeared on the 1643 Able to Bear Arms List for Plymouth.Eugene Aubrey Stratton, Plymouth Colony: Its History and People, 1620-1691 (Salt Lake City:Ancestry Publishing 1986) p. 270  Life in Leiden  He is first noted in historical records on April 25, 1603 in Leiden, Holland as a witness at Raphael Roelandt's betrothal. For purposes unknown, Cooke resided in Leiden for about six years before the arrival of the congregation of English Separatist Pastor John Robinson in 1609.Caleb H. Johnson, The Mayflower and her passengers (Indiana:Xlibris Corp., Caleb Johnson, 2006) p. 121 Cooke was betrothed to Hester Mahieu at the French Walloon Church (Vrouwekerk) in Leiden on June 30, 1603, with she joining the church one month prior to her betrothal. Her family were Protestant (Walloon) refugees from Lille, Spanish Netherlands (present- day France) to England. She was probably born in the late 1580s with her family coming to Leiden about 1590. Mary Mahieu, a possible sister of Hester, married Jan de Lannoy in Leiden and their child Philip de Lannoy had Cooke as a witness to his baptism in the Vrouwekerk on November 6, 1603. Cooke's nephew Philip \\"Delanoy\\" would later join the Separatist Church in England and arrived in Plymouth in November 1621 on the ship Fortune. Here Banks and Johnson betrothal data differs. Per Banks, Leiden records give Cooke's betrothal as 9 June 1603, and presuming his birth was 1582 or before. In the Leiden church Betrothal Book he was recorded as \\"Franchois Couck\\" and his bride being Hester Mahieu with the witnesses to the marriage being two Walloons. They were identified as \\"from England\\" (Francis) and as \\"from Canterbury\\" (Hester).The Mayflower Quarterly, vol. 78, no. 2, June 2012, by Jeremy Dupertius Bangs, Director of the American Pilgrim Museum in Leiden, Holland, p. 140 It is known that Cooke and his wife departed Leiden in August 1606 for Norwich in county Norfolk in England, which may have been where he originated but there is no proof has been found in records of the time. The Leiden congregation had some Separatist members who had fled Norwich, and the Cookes may have contacted the Separatists there. The Cookes did not remain in Norwich long as their son John was baptized at the Walloon Church in Leiden between January and March 1607 with the couple receiving communion in Leiden on January 1, 1608. Francis and his wife Hester were identified as \\"Franchoys Cooke et Esther sa femme\\" in Leiden after their return from Norwich, taking communion in Leiden's Walloon church on New Year's Day, 1608.The Mayflower Quarterly, vol. 78, no. 2, June 2012, by Jeremy Dupertius Bangs, Director of the American Pilgrim Museum in Leiden, Holland pp. 140-147 In February 1609, members of Pastor John Robinson's English Separatist church came to Leiden. The Cookes did not then become members of the Walloon church, but did join the Leiden congregation sometime later, after their daughter Elizabeth was baptized on December 26, 1611.Caleb H. Johnson, The Mayflower and her passengers (Indiana: Xlibris Corp., Caleb Johnson, 2006), p. 122 When the English Separatist church in Leiden decided to go to America in 1620, Cooke decided that from his family only he and his thirteen year‚Äìold son John would go over. His wife Hester and younger children would remain in Leiden until the colony was more established.  The Mayflower Voyage  Signing the Mayflower Compact 1620, a painting by Jean Leon Gerome Ferris 1899 The Mayflower departed Plymouth, England on September 6/16, 1620. The small, 100-foot ship had 102 passengers and a crew of about 30-40 in extremely cramped conditions. By the second month out, the ship was being buffeted by strong westerly gales, causing the ship's timbers to be badly shaken with caulking failing to keep out sea water, and with passengers, even in their berths, lying wet and ill. This, combined with a lack of proper rations and unsanitary conditions for several months, attributed to what would be fatal for many, especially the majority of women and children. On the way there were two deaths, a crew member and a passenger, but the worst was yet to come after arriving at their destination when, in the space of several months, almost half the passengers perished in cold, harsh, unfamiliar New England winter.Eugene Aubrey Stratton, Plymouth Colony: Its History and People, 1620-1691 (Salt Lake City: Ancestry Publishing 1986) p. 413 On November 9/19, 1620, after about 5 months at sea, including 3 months of delays in England, they spotted land, which was the Cape Cod Hook, now called Provincetown Harbor. And after two days of trying to get south to their planned destination of the Colony of Virginia, strong winter seas forced them to return to the harbor at Cape Cod hook, where they anchored on November 11/21. The Mayflower Compact was signed that day.George Ernest Bowman, The Mayflower Compact and its signers (Boston: Massachusetts Society of Mayflower Descendants, 1920). Photocopies of the 1612, 1649 and 1699 versions of the document pp. 7-19.  In Plymouth Colony  Cooke was not involved in government or politics in Plymouth, and in his life kept a low profile, but his work on behalf of the people of Plymouth colony has been well-recognized by history. Per Bradford, Cooke was recorded by him as \\"Francis Cooke and his son John. But his wife and children came afterwards.\\"Eugene Aubrey Stratton, Plymouth Colony: Its History and People, 1620-1691 (Salt Lake City: Ancestry Publishing, 1986), p. 406 After the Pilgrim arrival at Cape Cod, Cooke was one of those who signed the Mayflower Compact on November 11, 1620. Cooke's house plot in New Plymouth that was assigned late in 1620 was located between the plots of Isaac Allerton and Edward Winslow. Cooke's wife and children came over on the ship Anne in July 1623.Caleb H. Johnson, The Mayflower and her passengers (Indiana: Xlibris Corp., Caleb Johnson, 2006), p. 123 In the Division of Land in 1623, Cooke received two acres, one for himself and one acre for his son John. He also received 4 \\"akers\\" for his wife and children who \\"came ouer on the ship called Anne\\" in 1623.Eugene Aubrey Stratton, Plymouth Colony: Its History and People, 1620-1691, (Salt Lake City: Ancestry Publishing, 1986), p. 417 There was an agreement signed in 1626 in which fifty-eight planters, including Cooke and many other \\"first comers\\", later known as Purchasers, bought from the Merchant Adventurers all their colony stock, shares, land, etc.. Later these Purchasers would assign all shares and debt in the company to eight Plymouth notables and four former Adventurers from London, then to be known as Undertakers. This was to be an investment organization with profits supposedly going largely to the colony.Eugene Aubrey Stratton, Plymouth Colony: Its History and People, 1620-1691 (Salt Lake City: Ancestry Publishing, 1986), p. 419 In the 1627 Division of Cattle at Plymouth, his family was the one recorded first as: \\"The first lot fell to ffrancis Cooke & his Companie Joyned to him wife Hester Cooke.\\" Also named in the 1627 records were their children John, Jacob, Jane, Hester and Mary as well as two men ‚Äì Cooke‚Äôs nephew \\"Phillip Delanoy\\" (Delano) and Experience Mitchell, who would marry Cooke's daughter Jane soon after.Eugene Aubrey Stratton, Plymouth Colony: Its History and People, 1620-1691 (Salt Lake City: Ancestry Publishing, 1986) p. 421 On January 3, 1627/8, Cooke was one of six men named to lay out the boundaries for the twenty-acre land grants that would be made to everyone who came as a planter, under the employ of the joint-stock company.Caleb H. Johnson, The Mayflower and her passengers (Indiana: Xlibris Corp., Caleb Johnson, 2006), p. 124 In early 1633, Cooke was assigned by the court to help resolve a dispute of a financial nature between Peter Browne and Dr. Samuel Fuller. These men are believed the men of the same names who were companions of Cooke on the Mayflower voyage, both dying later in 1633. During the 1630s and 1640s, Cooke held a number of public sector positions but was never in government or politics. In 1634 he was one of a number of Plymouth men tasked with laying out the highways. In 1637 he was appointed, with others, to lay highways about the towns of Plymouth, Duxbury and Eel River. Cooke and others performed this task and two months later reported back to the Plymouth Court.Eugene Aubrey Stratton, Plymouth Colony: Its History and People, 1620-1691 (Salt Lake City: Ancestry Publishing, 1986), p. 124 On October 1, 1636, John Harmon, son of Edmund Harmon, tailor, of London, became an apprentice to Cooke for a period of seven years.Eugene Aubrey Stratton, Plymouth Colony: Its History and People, 1620-1691 (Salt Lake City: Ancestry Publishing, 1986), p. 298 Cooke was awarded damages by the court on March 7, 1636/7 in a civil case involving the abuse of his cattle against Mr. John Browne the younger, who had previously been an Assistant and magistrate. Others also charged, all being in the service of John Browne the elder and Thomas Willet, were Thomas Lettice, James Walker and Thomas Teley. On June 7, 1637, due to Browne's failure to the damages, the court reaffirmed the verdict and ordered John Browne to pay.Eugene Aubrey Stratton, Plymouth Colony: Its History and People, 1620-1691 (Salt Lake City: Ancestry Publishing, 1986), pp. 156, 317 In May 1640 Cooke and his son John were among those tasked to compute the number of acres of Edward Doty's meadows and make a report to the next court. In October 1640 Cooke was appointed to compute the land boundaries between Thomas Prence and Clement Briggs at Jones River. In 1640/41 he was one of twelve men tasked by the court to designate additional highways, and make a formal survey and mark the boundaries of plots of land in the town of Plain Dealing. The next year he was one of four Plymouth surveyors and was tasked to survey the highway for Jones River. In 1645 he was again highway surveyor for Plymouth. In June 1650, when he was almost seventy, he was still doing survey work, as when he and twelve others reported to the court that they had marked a new way from Jones River to the Massachusetts Path through John Rogers property. And even in August 1659, in his late 70s, he was again called upon by the Plymouth Court to resolve a land boundary dispute between Thomas Pope and William Shurtliff. Although he was specially qualified to survey new highways, he did do other public service work, being on several petty and grand juries. He also served on civil case juries in late 1639, March 1640, mid-and-late 1642 and March 1643 court sessions. Most of the civil case involved trespass, debts or slander. He was also on grand juries in 1638, 1640, 1642 and 1643, which involved crimes of a misdemeanor or felony nature. In the 1643 Able to Bear Arms (ATBA) List, Cooke and his sons Jacob and John (\\"John Cooke, Jnr, his boy\\") are listed with those from Plymouth.Eugene Aubrey Stratton, Plymouth Colony: Its History and People, 1620-1691 (Salt Lake City: Ancestry Publishing, 1986), p.440 In 1651 Bradford recorded his impression of Cooke and his family in his later years: \\"Francis Cooke is still living, a very olde man, and hath seen his children's children have children; after his wife came over, (with other of his children,) he hath 3 still living by her, all married, and have 5 children; so their increase is 8. And his sone John, which came over with him, is maried, and hath 4 children living.\\"Eugene Aubrey Stratton, Plymouth Colony: Its History and People, 1620-1691, (Salt Lake City: Ancestry Publishing, 1986), p. 409 On June 3, 1662 the General Court approved a list of thirty-three names \\"as being the first borne children of this government,\\" to receive two tracts of land purchased from the Indians by the colony. The list was wider in scope than just being for \\"first born\\" settlers, as it named several of the original Mayflower passengers, including Cooke, but was presumably for their children.Eugene Aubrey Stratton, Plymouth Colony: Its History and People, 1620-1691 (Salt Lake City: Ancestry Publishing, 1986), p. 173  Family  Cooke married Hester Mahieu in Leiden, Holland on July 20, 1603 or shortly thereafter.

He was an early opponent of the accommodationist race policies of Booker T. Washington, and in 1901 founded the Boston Guardian, an independent African-American newspaper he used to express that opposition. Active in protest movements for civil rights throughout the 1900s and 1910s, he also revealed some of the differences within the African-American community. He contributed to the formation of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP). Trotter was born into a well-to-do family and raised in Hyde Park, Massachusetts. He earned his graduate and post-graduate degrees at Harvard University, and was the first man of color to earn a Phi Beta Kappa key there. Seeing an increase in segregation in northern facilities, he began to engage in a life of activism, to which he devoted his assets. He joined with W. E. B. Du Bois in founding the Niagara Movement in 1905, a forerunner of the NAACP. Trotter's style was often divisive, and he ended up leaving that organization and founding the National Equal Rights League. His protest activities were sometimes seen to be at cross purposes to those of the NAACP. In 1914, he had a highly publicized meeting with President Woodrow Wilson, in which he protested Wilson's introduction of segregation into the federal workplace. In Boston, Trotter succeeded in shutting down productions of The Clansman in 1910, but he was unsuccessful in 1915 with screenings of the movie The Birth of a Nation, which also portrayed the Ku Klux Klan in favorable terms. He was not able to influence the peace talks at the end of World War I, and was in later years a marginalized voice of protest. In an alliance with Roman Catholics, he got a revival screening banned of The Birth of a Nation in 1921. He died on his 62nd birthday after a possibly suicidal fall from his Boston home. Early life and education William was the third child, and first to survive infancy, of James Monroe Trotter and Virginia (Isaacs) Trotter.Fox, p. 9 His father James was born into slavery in Mississippi; James' mother Letitia was enslaved, and his father was her white master Richard S. Trotter.Fox, p. 3 Letitia, her son and two daughters were freed by their master after his marriage and sent to Cincinnati, Ohio, which had a thriving free black community. After working as a teacher, James Trotter enlisted in the United States Colored Troops during the American Civil War,Fox, p. 4 and was the first man of color to be promoted to lieutenant in the 55th Regiment of the Massachusetts Volunteer Infantry (Colored).Fox, p. 5 Duganne, Erina, \\"Black Civil War Portraiture in Context\\", mirror of race.org, April 5, 2012. Retrieved 2015-11-29. Virginia Isaacs, also of mixed race, was born free in 1842 in either Ohio or Virginia. Her mother Ann-Elizabeth Fossett was born into slavery at Monticello, where she was a daughter of Joseph Fossett and Edith Hern Fossett, and great granddaughter of Elizabeth Hemings. Virginia's father Tucker Isaacs was a free person of color. He purchased the freedom of Ann-Elizabeth Fossett, Virginia's mother. The family moved to Chillicothe in the free state of Ohio, where Virginia grew up in its thriving black community. There she met and married James Trotter.Fox, p. 8 Shortly after the Civil War, the Trotters moved from Ohio to settle in Boston, Massachusetts. After their first two children died in infancy, they returned to the Isaacs farm of Virginia's parents, where their son William Monroe Trotter was born on April 7, 1872. When he was seven months old, the family moved back to Boston, where they settled in the South End, far from the predominantly African- American west side of Beacon Hill. The family later moved to suburban Hyde Park, a white neighborhood. The Trotters had two more children, both daughters. James, 1881 engraving Trotter's father broke through many racial obstacles placed before him, but was often frustrated in his attempts to gain equal treatment or fair consideration. While serving in the Union Army, he protested the inequality of pay between blacks and whites. In Boston he was the first man of color to be employed by the Post Office Department (now the U.S. Postal Service), a job he left after he was repeatedly passed over for promotion because of discriminatory Republican-led federal government policy.Fox, p. 10 Politically active, the elder Trotter was a leading African- American Democrat in New England. He supported Grover Cleveland for President, and was rewarded in 1886 when Cleveland appointed him Recorder of Deeds for the District of Columbia, the highest federal position filled by black men at the time.Fox, p. 12 Two other prominent men of color of that era, Frederick Douglass and Senator Blanche Kelso Bruce, also held the post.Finkelman, p. 216 The job was a lucrative one, and the Trotter family prospered.Fox, p. 13 The young Trotter (who was usually called by his middle name \\"Monroe\\") grew up in this environment, and was introduced to Archibald Grimk√©, another politically active African American who also lived in Hyde Park.Fox, p. 14 He excelled in school, graduating from the otherwise all-white Hyde Park High School as valedictorian and president of his high school class.Harrison, p. 239 He went on to Harvard University, where he continued to distinguish himself academically. He was awarded merit scholarships after his father died, and was the first man of color to be awarded a Phi Beta Kappa key at Harvard. He earned a bachelor's degree magna cum laude in 1895 and a Masters in 1896, working a variety of odd jobs to help pay his tuition.Fox, pp. 15‚Äì19 During his years at Harvard, he adopted a number of habits which he maintained for much of his life. He organized and led the Total Abstinence League, a temperance organization; he was a teetotaler and never drank alcohol.Fox, p. 17 He was active in the Baptist church, in which he had considered becoming a minister.Fox, p. 15 Marriage and family Following his graduation, Trotter participated in the upper echelons of Negro society in Boston, a number of whose members had ancestors free before the Civil War.Fox, p. 21 He belonged to an exclusive literary society that met at the home of Cambridge educator Maria Baldwin. On June 27, 1899, Trotter married Geraldine Louise (\\"Deenie\\") Pindell (October 3, 1872 ‚Äì October 8, 1918), who was from another activist family. He had known her since childhood.Fox, p. 22 She assisted him throughout his career until her death in the 1918 flu pandemic.Harrison, p. 240 The couple had no children.Fox, p. 212 Early career Trotter's career began inauspiciously. His initial attempts to get jobs at established banking and real estate firms were unsuccessful, leading him through a succession of lower-paying clerking jobs.Fox, p. 24 He finally landed a job in a white-owned real estate firm in 1898, but decided the next year to open his own business selling insurance and brokering mortgages. He was not particularly active in agitating for civil rights in these years, although his strong opinions on racial equality were evident in an 1899 paper in which he called on African Americans to seek admission to institutions of higher learning. (It was a common practice of the time to direct African Americans away from higher education opportunities and into industrial training programs.) Trotter's business was relatively successful, and he was able to purchase investment properties.Fox, p. 25 Trotter was increasingly troubled by what he saw as the accommodationist policies of Booker T. Washington, one of the leading African- American figures of the 1890s and founder of the Tuskegee Institute. Washington's policies were enshrined in the Atlanta Compromise, outlined in an 1895 speech he gave in Atlanta, Georgia. He said that Southern African Americans should not agitate for political rights (such as the right to vote and equal treatment under the law) as long as they were provided economic opportunities and basic rights of due process.Brown and Stentiford, pp. 55‚Äì56 Washington actively promoted the idea that African Americans, once they had proven themselves as productive members of society, would be granted full political rights. Trotter, Grimk√©, W. E. B. Du Bois, and other northern radicals disagreed with these ideas, arguing that it was necessary for African Americans to agitate for equal treatment and full constitutional rights, because doing so would bring other benefits.Fox, pp. 36‚Äì43 By the turn of the century, African Americans in the South had been effectively disfranchised by violence around elections, and restrictions in voting registration rules, and, finally, constitutional amendments or new constitutions in southern states. Although Boston was comparatively congenial when compared to other parts of the country, Trotter and others felt that Washington's stance was leading to an increase in more typically Southern racist attitudes in the city. \\"The conviction grew upon me\\", he wrote, that his business successes could be endangered \\"if race prejudice and persecution and public discrimination from mere color was to spread up from the South and result in a fixed caste of color\\".Fox, p. 27 The Guardian Trotter's racial activism blossomed in 1901. He helped found the Boston Literary and Historical Association, which became, according to biographer Stephen Fox, \\"a forum for militant race opinion\\".Fox, p. 28 He also joined the Massachusetts Racial Protective Association, another local group that promoted political goals of equality. Under the aegis of the latter group, Trotter in October 1901 gave his first major protest speech, attacking Washington's accommodationist stance: \\"In Boston [Washington] said that the Negro should wait for the franchise until he had got property, education and character. Washington's attitude has ever been one of servility.\\"Fox, p. 29 With George W. Forbes, another Protective Association member, in 1901 Trotter co-founded the Guardian, a weekly newspaper. At first Forbes, an Amherst College graduate with some experience in publishing, was the driving operational force in its production, while Trotter funded the effort and served as its managing editor.Fox, pp. 29‚Äì30 The paper became a forum for a more outspoken and forceful approach to gaining racial equality, and its contributors and editorials (which were generally written by Trotter) regularly attacked Washington. The paper's editorial stance brought a stream of criticism from more mainstream African-American publications: the New York Age, calling it \\"putrescent\\", wrote that \\"Editor Trotter ... makes himself smelt if not felt\\"; another wrote that the Guardian was \\"carrying its cases too fast and too far\\", and that Trotter suffered from a \\"mental malady\\".Fox, p. 31 The Guardian had limited circulation, but was highly influential as one of only 200 African-American publications in the country. It suffered financially due to Trotter's poor accounting and inattention due to his heavy schedule. Forbes, who principally worked as a librarian in the city library, left the business in 1904 because of Booker T. Washington's legal assaults on the newspaper and pressure by Washington supporters on his employers.Fox, pp. 30, 64‚Äì65 Trotter's wife, and later his sister, assisted in the paper's publication.Horne and Young, pp. 31‚Äì32 Trotter, in a deliberate move, transferred the Guardian offices in 1907 to the same building that had once housed William Lloyd Garrison's Liberator. Trotter idolized Garrison, a leading abolitionist agitator before the Civil War, and had studied his methods.Fox, p. 98 He was a regular correspondent with Garrison's sons William Jr. and Francis Garrison.Fox, pp. 118‚Äì119 The Guardian was always unprofitable, a condition that was exacerbated by Trotter's refusal to take advertising for alcohol and tobacco. He sold off all of his Boston- area properties by 1910 to raise funds for the newspaper, and he was lax in collecting payments from his subscribers. In his later years, the quality of the publication noticeably declined, and its operations were propped up by a local community group's fund-raising activities.Fox, pp. 206‚Äì208Puttkammer and Worthy, p. 311 Attacking the African-American establishment Booker T. Washington giving a speech at Carnegie Hall in New York City, 1909 In the early 1900s Trotter noticed that racial segregation was spreading in Boston: the number of hotels, restaurants, and other public establishments refusing service to African Americans was increasing.Fox, pp. 34‚Äì35 He came to realize that, in order to effect real change, the radical message needed to be taken out of Boston, and began organizing protest meetings across New England in 1903. At the suggestion of Trotter, William H. Ferris went to Washington D.C. in January 1903. Ferris gave a presentation critical to Booker T. Washington in front of the Bethel Literary and Historical Society on January 6, 1903. Richard W.

Moore, Leading the Race: The Transformation of the Black Elite in the Nation's Capital, 1880-1920 University of Virginia Press, 1999, p68 His long-term objective was to effect policy changes in the National Afro-American Council, then the only national-level organization of African Americans.Fox, p. 46 At the group's annual meeting in Louisville, Kentucky, Trotter and others introduced resolutions calling for more activism, but Booker T. Washington supporters (also known as \\"Bookerites\\"), who controlled the council, saw to their defeat. One commentator wrote that the \\"Boston idiots\\" had been treated \\"in delightful fashion\\".Fox, p. 48 The Guardian described the convention as \\"dominated to death by one man\\".Fox, p. 49 The activities of the radicals at the convention did bring them some national press. Trotter continued to criticize Washington in the Guardian; his attacks were particularly harsh and personal, and brought a bitter tinge to the disagreement.Fox, pp. 39‚Äì40 In this period, while the Great Migration of African Americans out of the South to the North was beginning, blacks in the two regions dealt with different conditions. The vast majority of the millions of African Americans still lived in the South, many in rural areas where they were the majority population. But they were effectively disfranchised by new electoral rules and state constitutions, utterly closed out of the political process. This situation would continue, despite some temporarily effective court challenges, through the 1960s. Washington believed he had to help this population within the constraints of their environment. At the same time, he secretly funded legal challenges against the voter registration and electoral restrictions.Richard H. Pildes, Democracy, Anti-Democracy, and the Canon, Constitutional Commentary, vol.17, 2000, pp.13-14 Accessed 10 March 2008 Trotter and other radicals tended to come from the North, where African Americans exercised more rights in daily life, including the suffrage, were more urbanized, and had achieved more in work and education, but were still subject to discrimination. Following their failure to advance the radical agenda in Louisville, Trotter and the other radicals sought a more sympathetic forum in which to attack Booker T. Washington. An opportunity arrived when Washington was set to speak in Boston in July 1903. When the Tuskegee Institute leader was introduced to a visibly hostile crowd, a small riot broke out. Trotter, who had arrived prepared with several provocative questions to ask Washington, attempted to read them over the din of the melee. He was among the arrested, and the \\"Boston riot\\" received national press coverage.Fox, pp. 50‚Äì53 Trotter later claimed that there was no plan to break up the meeting.Fox, p. 51 Bookerites pressed charges against Trotter for disrupting the meeting; defended by Archibald Grimk√©, Trotter was convicted and spent thirty days in the Charles Street Jail. Although the Bookerites had hoped to discredit the radicals with the trial, they gained them wider publicity.Fox, pp. 55‚Äì58Trotter, Granville Martin, and Bernard Charles were tried, Charles was acquitted, while Trotter and Martin were found guilty and served thirty-day jail terms. Two Sent To Jail For Disturbing Booker Washington's Meeting. Broad Ax (Chicago, Illinois), Saturday, October 24, 1903, Page: 1 After the trial, Trotter founded the Boston Suffrage League (1903), and when a New England Suffrage League was founded in 1904, Trotter was elected president.Smith, n.p. Washington countered Trotter's attacks with a variety of tactics. He took various legal actions against Trotter, including at least one libel suit and criminal charges. In addition, he used his network to apply pressure to Trotter's supporters in their workplaces (in some cases government and academic positions). In addition, he had other sympathizers secretly infiltrate and report on activist meetings organized by Trotter and others.Fox, pp. 60‚Äì71 Washington also provided financial support and expertise to start other publications in Boston to counter Trotter's radical voice.Schneider, p. 67 As a result of such activities, Trotter's printer dropped the activist and his newspaper as a client. But Trotter found another printer and continued publishing the Guardian despite the setback.Fox, p. 97 Niagara Movement and the NAACP In the early months of 1905, Booker T. Washington sought to create an umbrella organization to represent all the major African-American leaders of the day. Du Bois and Grimk√© were the two most radical leaders invited to its early organizational meetings, but both eventually refused to ally with Washington, whom they saw as dominating the group.Fox, pp. 82‚Äì86 Du Bois, Trotter, and two others organized a meeting of radicals from across the nation in western New York. Meeting in July just across the Canada‚ÄìUS border in Fort Erie, Ontario they founded the Niagara Movement.Fox, p. 90 Organized so that no one man could dominate it, the group espoused a radical declaration of principles (authored by Trotter and Du Bois), calling for agitation for equal economic opportunity and exercise of full civil rights for African Americans.Fox, p. 91 The organization was soon divided internally by political and personal disagreements, and Washington worked from outside against its growth.Wintz, p. 8 W. E. B. Du Bois, 1904 photo During the early months of 1906, friction began to develop between Du Bois and Trotter over the admission of women to the organization. Du Bois supported the idea, and Trotter opposed it, but eventually relented. The matter was smoothed over during the 1906 meeting.Fox, p. 103 Their division became more significant when Trotter split with Clement Morgan, a longtime supporter and Movement member, over Massachusetts politics and control of the local Movement chapter. Du Bois sided with Morgan and,Fox, pp. 104‚Äì106 when the Movement met in Boston in 1907, he reappointed Morgan to a leading position in the organization.Fox, p. 108 Attempts to heal the rift failed, and Trotter resigned from the Movement.Fox, pp. 109‚Äì110 Because of these difficulties, the organization had effectively collapsed by 1908. The break between Trotter and Du Bois was permanent, and they never worked directly together again.Fox, pp. 100‚Äì114 Du Bois wrote in 1909 that it was \\"utterly impossible to work with Mr. Trotter.\\"Schneider, p. 116 Despite the Niagara Movement's failure, its goals had appealed to white supporters of racial equality. They participated in the founding of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), which drew an inter-racial coalition of support. Trotter and Du Bois were both present at meetings in 1909 in which its foundation was laid. Although some of Trotter's proposals were accepted (to address segregated transportation as a grievance), others were not (such as his proposal for a bill to make lynching a federal crime). Trotter was not invited to be on the organization's executive committee; neither was Booker T. Washington, who boycotted the effort.Fox, pp. 128‚Äì130 Trotter never played a significant role in the NAACP, and in its early years actively competed with it. In 1911 Trotter's group and the NAACP both held rallies in Boston to mark the centennial of abolitionist Charles Sumner's birth.Schneider, pp. 116‚Äì117 Trotter was peripherally involved with the NAACP for a few years, but he did not approve of the amount of white involvement in the interracial group. His feud with Du Bois ran deep, so he rarely contributed to the organization at the national level.Fox, p. 136 He was also troubled by the attitudes expressed in the Boston chapter, which he told NAACP leader Joel Spingarn needed more \\"radical, courageous activity.\\" He eventually drifted away from the NAACP.Fox, pp. 136‚Äì140 National Equal Rights League After Trotter split from the Niagara Movement, he helped organize a conference of like-minded activists held in Philadelphia in April 1908, and served as the conference chair. In this capacity, he excluded any attendees whose racial ideology he opposed, as well as those who supported Republican William Howard Taft in the upcoming presidential election.Fox, pp. 110‚Äì111 (Trotter opposed Taft because he had tired of what he considered the Republican Party laissez-faire policies on race.)Fox, p. 154 This conference led to the formation of the Negro-American Political League, which eventually became known as the National Equal Rights League (NERL).Fox, pp. 111, 140 Trotter described this group as \\"of the colored people and for the colored people and led by the colored people.\\"Fox, p. 140 Political cartoon about the 1912 presidential election, depicting Theodore Roosevelt (cowboy hat), Woodrow Wilson (cap), and William Howard Taft (top hat) NERL, which biographer Fox describes as Trotter's \\"personal fief\\", was unable to attract high-profile membership as the NAACP did.Fox, pp. 140‚Äì141 Trotter did not want white members, and was unable to work effectively with other African-American leaders. NERL and the NAACP, while both working toward similar goals, regularly feuded over matters public and personal.Fox, p. 141 As the NAACP attracted more money and talent, and became the center of anti-Bookerite civil rights activity, Trotter and the NERL became increasingly marginalized on the left.Fox, pp. 144‚Äì145 Trotter would not have as prominent a role in the civil rights dialogue again.Fox, p. 146 By 1921 the League had been reduced to a handful of Trotter supporters.Puttkammer and Worthy, p. 304 Trotter and Woodrow Wilson Trotter's opposition to Booker T. Washington placed him at odds with Theodore Roosevelt and William Howard Taft, Republican presidents who relied on Washington as an adviser and otherwise enjoyed widespread African-American support. Trotter supported the southern Democrat Woodrow Wilson in the 1912 election. Wilson, in a brief meeting with Trotter and other NERL members, made vague statements about fair treatment of African Americans. But, he succumbed to pressure from Southerners in his cabinet and agreed to segregate federal offices. The NAACP and NERL (then known as the National Independent Political League, or NIPL) protested, and Trotter secured a meeting with Wilson at the White House in November 1913.Fox, p. 175 Wilson said that his policies were not segregationist, but Trotter characterized Wilson's denial as \\"preposterous\\".O'Reilly, p. 119 Trotter continued his protests, eventually gaining a second invitation to the White House in November 1914. This meeting with Wilson ended with a heated exchange between the two men. Wilson claimed to be dealing with a \\"human problem\\" from which politics should be left out, and suggested to Trotter's group that they could always vote for someone else in the next election. Trotter continued to argue that the segregationist policy was humiliating to African Americans. Wilson responded, \\"If you take it as a humiliation, which it is not intended as, and sow the seed of that impression all over the country, why the consequences will be very serious.\\" After Trotter said this was an insult, Wilson angrily ordered him to leave, saying \\"If this organization wishes to approach me again, it must choose another spokesman ... your tone, sir, offends me.\\" Trotter's second meeting with the President was widely covered in the press, featured on the front page of the New York Times and other leading newspapers. A white Texas newspaper described Trotter as \\"merely a nigger\\" and \\"not a Booker T. Washington type of colored man\\",Fox, p. 182 and northern papers also criticized him for his \\"insolence\\" to the president.Fox, p. 183 The Boston Evening Transcript, while observing that Wilson's policy was segregationist and divisive, pointed out that although Trotter was basically correct, he \\"offends many of his own color by his ... untactful belligerency\\". African Americans were divided in their response to the incident: some claimed that he did not represent them, while others, notably Du Bois, grudgingly admired Trotter's audacity. Du Bois wrote that Wilson was \\"insulting & condescending\\" in the meeting.Fox, pp. 184‚Äì185 Trotter parlayed the publicity into a series of speaking engagements, in which he denied \\"that in language, manner, tone, in any respect or to the slightest degree I was impudent, insolent, or insulting to the President.\\"Fox, p. 186 The William Monroe Trotter House in Dorchester Trotter continued to protest segregationist policies of the Wilson administration. When the country began large-scale recruiting for the military in World War I, Trotter opposed the establishment of segregated officer training facilities. Through his influence, recruitment of blacks in the Boston area was lower than expected. During World War II, the military integrated the officer corps, and President Harry Truman afterward completed integration of the armed services.Harrison, p. 243 When the Great War ended, Trotter sought to use the 1919 Paris Peace Conference as a vehicle to raise international awareness of US government policy toward African Americans. He viewed the reality of segregation as incompatible with Wilson's war vision to \\"make the world safe for Democracy.\\"Harrison, pp. 243‚Äì244 Trotter organized a meeting in Washington, DC related to the peace conference; he and ten other African-American delegates were chosen to attend the peace conference. The State Department refused to issue passports to those delegates, or to African Americans planning to attend a Pan-African Congress that Du Bois was organizing to be held concurrently with the peace conference in Paris. Du Bois and other African Americans were supporting African colonies' desire for independence.Fox, pp. 223‚Äì224 To get to Europe, Trotter posed as a seaman seeking work in New York, and got a job as a cook on the SS Yarmouth to gain passage to France.Fox, p. 224 He arrived in Paris alone and with little more than his cook's clothing, only to find that the principal peace negotiations had already taken place. The powers did not include any statement of racial equality. Trotter attracted the French press in his accounts of racial mistreatment in the United States, but he could not gain access to any of the official delegations to the peace conference.Fox, pp. 226‚Äì228 He also missed Du Bois' Pan-African Congress, which was held in February 1919 while he was still seeking passage.Fox, p. 225 Trotter returned to the United States in July 1919 to learn of ongoing race riots at major cities across the country. Postwar economic and social tensions had erupted, and blacks fought back against white violence in cities such as Chicago and Omaha. Trotter quickly supported active resistance to white-on-black violence, writing, \\"Unless the white American behaves, he will find that in teaching our boys to fight for him he was starting something that he will not be able to stop.\\"Fox, p. 233 His writings prompted calls in Congress for the censorship of the Negro press: South Carolina Congressman James F. Byrnes accused Trotter of \\"doing his utmost to incite riots and bloodshed.\\" Massachusetts Senator Henry Cabot Lodge gave Trotter a chance to testify during Senate deliberations on ratification of the Treaty of Versailles, which Lodge opposed on grounds other than Trotter's. Lodge's opposition was successful: the Senate never ratified the treaty.Fox, p. 234 Other protests and later years Theatrical poster for The Birth of a Nation Trotter mounted a campaign against Thomas Dixon's play The Clansman when it opened in Boston in 1910, which portrayed the Ku Klux Klan in heroic terms during Reconstruction. His protests succeeded in closing the production.Harrison, pp. 242‚Äì243 While on his speaking tour in early 1915, he learned that D. W. Griffith's movie, The Birth of a Nation, adapted from The Clansman, would be opening in Boston. He rushed back to lead protests against the film. In April, the Tremont Theatre denied Trotter and a group of African Americans tickets to the showing. When they refused to leave the lobby, plainclothes police moved in, sparking a scuffle. Trotter and ten others were arrested; other protests took place both inside and outside the theater.Fox, pp. 191‚Äì192 Trotter, united with other factions of the African- American community, tried but could not get the film banned in Boston.Fox, pp. 194‚Äì197 This united front, along with the death later in 1915 of Booker T. Washington, reduced for a time the internal hostilities in the Boston African- American community.Fox, pp. 198‚Äì200 The KKK had a revival for a decade after 1915, especially in industrial cities and the Midwest. In 1921, Trotter was successful in shutting down new screenings of The Birth of a Nation in Boston; he allied with Roman Catholic organizations, who objected to the KKK's anti- Catholic stance of the 20th century, and were strong in the city as a result of extensive Irish and Italian immigration.Fox, pp. 260‚Äì261 Trotter's wife had died in the 1918 influenza pandemic. She had been a partner in all his activities and he missed her greatly. Through the 1920s and 1930s, Trotter subsided into a genteel poverty, using the Guardian as an ongoing voice of protest.Fox, pp. 260‚Äì270 He lobbied for anti-lynching bills in Congress, with limited success. Even when the House overwhelmingly passed such a bill in 1922, the Southern bloc in the Senate filibustered and effectively killed passage of the bill for three years running.Associated Press, \\"Senate Apologizes for Not Passing Anti-Lynching Laws\\", Fox News. Note: From 1882-1968, \\"...nearly 200 anti-lynching bills were introduced in Congress, and three passed the House. Seven presidents between 1890 and 1952 petitioned Congress to pass a federal law.\\" None was approved by the Senate because of the powerful opposition of the Southern Democratic voting bloc. (White Democrats effectively controlled nearly all the Congressional seats apportioned to the total population of the South, after having disfranchised blacks.) They controlled chairmanships of numerous important committees, which were established by seniority. In 1923 Trotter eventually came to an uneasy truce with the NAACP.Fox, pp. 240‚Äì249 His attempts to promote his style of activism, however, were eclipsed by activities of younger leaders, such as Marcus Garvey, a Jamaican immigrant in New York City and leader of the UNIA.Fox, pp. 252‚Äì256 Through these years, Trotter routinely wrote in the Guardian about incidents of racial injustice, including the 1931 trials of the Scottsboro boys. They had been accused and were convicted of raping two white women in Alabama. Historians have concluded they were innocent.Puttkammer and Worthy, p. 313 On the morning of April 7, 1934, his 62nd birthday, William Monroe Trotter died after a fall from the roof of his home in Boston. The cause is uncertain, but it is known that he was depressed and troubled at the time. He may have committed suicide.Fox, pp. 271‚Äì275 He was buried in Boston's Fairview Cemetery. Legacy and honors *Several schools and academic institutions were named for him: the William Monroe Trotter Elementary School in Dorchester, the William Monroe Trotter Institute at the University of Massachusetts Boston (a research institute for the study of black history and black culture), and the William Monroe Trotter Multicultural Center (aka Trotter House) at the University of Michigan. *Trotter's first home in Dorchester, the William Monroe Trotter House, was designated a National Historic Landmark in recognition of his significance in the civil rights cause. *In 2002, scholar Molefi Kete Asante listed William Monroe Trotter among his 100 Greatest African Americans.Asante, Molefi Kete (2002). 100 Greatest African Americans: A Biographical Encyclopedia, Amherst, New York.

A dormer window (also called dormer) is a form of roof window. Dormers are commonly used to increase the usable space in a loft and to create window openings in a roof plane. A dormer is often one of the primary elements of a loft conversion. As a prominent element of many buildings, different types of dormer have evolved to complement different styles of architecture. When the structure appears on the spires of churches and cathedrals, it is usually referred to as a lucarne. History The word dormer is derived from the Middle French , meaning \\"sleeping room\\", as dormer windows often provided light and space to attic-level bedrooms. One of the earliest uses of dormers was in the form of lucarnes, slender dormers which provided ventilation to the spires of English Gothic churches and cathedrals. An early example are the lucarnes of the spire of Christ Church Cathedral, Oxford. Dormer windows have been used in domestic architecture in Britain since the 16th century. Dormer windows were popularised by French architect Fran√ßois Mansart, who used dormers extensively in the mansard roofs he designed for 17th-century Paris. Today dormers are a widespread feature of pitched roof buildings. Types Some of the different types of dormer are: ; Gable fronted dormer: Also called simply a gabled dormer, this is the most common type. It has a simple pitched roof of two sloping planes, supported by a frame that rises vertically to form a triangular section below the roofline, i.e. a gable. It is also known as a dog-house dormer (due to its similar shape). ; Hip roof dormer: Also called a hipped dormer, it has a roof composed of three sloping planes that rise from each side of the dormer frame and converge at the ridge‚Äîanalogous to the hip roof. ; Flat roof dormer: The roof of this dormer is a single flat plane approximately horizontal (although usually slightly inclined to allow rain water to run off). ; Shed dormer: This dormer also has a single flat plane roof, but in this case, it is sloped in the same direction as the principal roof, only at a shallower angle.Dictionary of Architecture & Construction, C.M.Harris. A shed dormer can provide head room over a larger area than a gabled dormer, but as its roof pitch is shallower than the main roof, it may require a different roof covering. ; Wall dormer: As opposed to the dormer being set part way up the slope of the roof, this is a dormer whose face is coplanar with the face of the wall below. This means that the face of the dormer is essentially a continuation of the wall above the level of the eaves. ; Eyebrow, or eyelid dormer: A low and wide dormer with a curved roof and no sides. Instead, the roof covering is gradually curved up and over the dormer in a flattened bell curve. ; Link dormer: This can be a dormer that houses a chimney or a dormer that joins one part of a roof to another.A Visual Dictionary of Architecture. Francis D.K. Ching ; Bonneted dormer: This is an arched roof dormer, rounded in shape when viewed from front. Popular in Victorian homes, especially in certain areas, like the Southcott-style row-houses called Jellybean Row in St. John's, Newfoundland. ; Nantucket dormer: This is a three-in-one dormer structure composed of two gable dormers connected by a shed dormer in between. ; Lucarne: A dormer on the slope of a Gothic spire, usually slender and gable fronted. ; Blind or false dormer: A dormer that is only visible externally, i.e. does not provide any extra space or light internally. These are often used to make the house appear more aesthetically impressive.

In England and Wales, the General Permitted Development Order states classes of development for which such planning permission is not required. Such rights are only applicable outside conservation areas, national parks, Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty or The Broads. Dormers may introduce imbalance in the street scene and be seen as inappropriate within the local setting of streets and buildings. Popularity Dormers are popular in Ulster,The Bedside Book of Dormers and Other Delights: A Pictorial Guide to Traditional Architectural Details in Ulster and commonly used to create extra space when a loft is converted into a habitable room.About Loft Conversions (2008). \\"Dormer Loft Conversion\\", About Loft Conversions.

It is located next to Augsburg at the Lech river. The city was founded in the 13th century in order to collect a toll from people using the bridge across the Lech River. The city lies almost entirely on the western edge of the hills along the Lechleite, where the river Lech has formed a wide bed from glacial melt water. History Settlements in the area of Friedberg can be traced to Roman times through archeological findings of pottery and brickworks in the H√ºgelshart, Rohrbach (dating from the last third of the 3rd Century AD), St√§tzling (late 3rd Century to 4th Century AD) and Wulfertshausen districts.Ulrich Brandl und Emmi Federhofer: Ton + Technik. R√∂mische Ziegel. Theiss, Stuttgart 2010, (Schriften des Limesmuseums Aalen. Nr. 61) The town is mentioned in historical documents for the first time in letter of protection from Conrad of the House of Hohenstaufen together with Duke Ludwig II, also called \\"the Strict\\", of Bavaria and the Burgher of Augsburg, in 1264. The Fridberch castle was subsequently built to serve as a border security and customs post for the Duchy of Bavaria, but put the town in opposition to the free city of Augsburg. The castle was the cause of the first burning of Friedberg by Augsburg in 1396. The town was subject to the many frequent wars between Swabia, Bavaria and Augsburg. In 1485 Balthasar Hubmaier, a leading figure of the Baptist Reformation, was born in the town. A revival in the town's fortunes came when, in 1568, the Duchess Christine chose Friedberg castle as her seat following her husband's death. The town became the centre of Bavarian court life, but was short lived when the town was ravaged by the plague in 1599. More suffering came as the town was sacked twice by the Swedes during the Thirty Years War. After the war only the town hall, castle and city walls were left standing. The town was soon flourishing again as the Dukes of Bavaria encouraged artisans to settle in the area with the establishment of guilds in neighbouring Augsburg. Due to overcrowding, Friedberg offered accommodation to those displaced artisans who could not find rooms in Augsburg, and were not yet Master Craftsmen. The Pilgrimage church of \\"Our Lord's Rest\\", the Herrgottsruh, was built in 1753, is considered one of the most beautiful churches of the Bavarian rococo.

Local government Parbold had a population of 2,582 at the 2011 Census. West Lancashire is divided into 19 parish councils, the first tier of local government. Parbold is bordered by Hilldale to the north, Wrightington to the east, Dalton to the south and Newburgh to the west. From 1894 to 1974 Parbold was part of the Wigan Rural District, along with Dalton, Haigh, Shevington, Worthington and Wrightington. Location Sign at the top of Parbold Hill showing which landmarks can be seen in different directions Parbold lies in the valley of the River Douglas, at the bottom of Parbold Hill, about three miles west of junction 27 of the M6 motorway on the A5209. The village can also be reached by rail on the line from Manchester to Southport. Close to the village centre the Leeds and Liverpool Canal passes over the River Douglas. The nearest sizable towns are Skelmersdale (about 5 miles away), Ormskirk (7 miles), and Wigan (9 miles). The village is dominated by Parbold Hill which rises to 400 feet above sea level and offers stunning views of the West Lancashire plain but also over the North West of England across to Liverpool, Manchester and Wales. Wood Lane, just off the main road, is also known for its views of the surrounding countryside. Parbold is widely considered to be an affluent area. History View of the Leeds and Liverpool Canal through the village. Parbold Hill can be seen in the background. The earliest known reference to Parbold is in the late 12th century, where grants of land were made to nearby Burscough Priory (pronounced Bursk-owe).Virgoe, J. M. (1994). A History of Parbold. Carnegie. . After the Norman conquest, Parbold was part of the Barony of Manchester. Little development occurred from this time to the mid 18th century. Parbold became a civil parish in 1894. During the 18th and 19th centuries, a number of coal mines worked nearby, rather meagre, seams; hard sandstone was also quarried. Both coal and sandstone could be exported over the waterways; boatbuilding was a minor economic activity in Parbold around this time. The old windmill that is located next to the canal replaced an earlier water cornmill which once stood on Alder Lane, and was in use until 1985. Parbold railway station, built in the mid 19th century by the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway, radically altered the village; it allowed middle class workers to live in Parbold and commute to urban areas throughout the north- west. In recent years a direct hourly service has operated to Manchester Airport railway station giving quick access (less than 1 hour and 15 minutes journey time) to flights from Manchester Airport. The railway station also provided a natural centre for the village which it still is today. Parbold's war memorial is in the local Anglican church, Christ Church, near the top of Parbold Hill. The village's other church - Our Lady and All Saints - was consecrated by Bishop Robert Cornthwaite on 28 May 1884. Amenities Parbold has two churches, two primary schools and a nursery, a library built in 1989,History of Parbold Library , County Library and Information Service. a purpose-built village hall which doubles as a cinema and community centre, a telephone exchange, a doctor's surgery, a sub post office and a number of other shops including a pharmacy, a newsagent, an estate agent, three hairdressers and both Chinese and Indian takeaways plus a greengrocery. There are three pubs along the main road through the centre of the village - the Railway, the Windmill and the Stocks Tavern. Along with a branch of the Miller and Carter Steakhouse at the top of the hill and the Wayfarer: Brew Pub and Dining Rooms providing Al A Carte and Italian style foods.

It is about five miles (8 km) south-east of High Wycombe and three miles (5 km) east of Marlow, near the border with Berkshire and close to where the Buckinghamshire River Wye empties into the Thames. History Bourne End's original location differed from today's established village centre, and was a half-mile downstream on the River Thames. The name refers to the end of the river (bourne being an obsolete term for river), and derived from the mouth of the River Wye. Then a hamlet, it appears on Morden's 1722 map of Buckinghamshire as \\"Born end\\". It was noted in the 19th century, however, that the name had been corrupted to \\"Bone End\\", apparently through local mispronunciation and thence on official maps and documents. In 1858, the vicar of Wooburn succeeded in reversing the change, and the corrected name remains in use today. The length of the River Wye was the provider of water power for many mills in the valley for hundreds of years, and Bourne End was no exception. There were four on the final stretch of the river: Princes Mill, Jacksons (or Gunpowder) Mill, Hedsor Mill and Lower Mill. These mills were historically the predominant employers in the area, along with the local farms and two wharfs on the Thames. In the early nineteenth century, the settlement known as Bourne End was a hamlet of Wooburn parish, along with others such as Spring Gardens, Eghams Green, Cores End, Heavens Lea and Upper Bourne End. This changed with the emergence of the Wycombe Railway Company in 1846. By 1854, Isambard Kingdom Brunel had designed and constructed a railway linking Maidenhead to High Wycombe, via Bourne End. The station at Bourne End was originally named Marlow Road; then in 1873 a branch line to Marlow was built, and a year later the station was renamed Bourne End station to avoid confusion with the new station at Marlow town. The railway created more travel opportunities for locals and greatly benefited the mills, and thus Bourne End expanded, on a greater scale than other similar settlements in the surrounding area. See Marlow Branch Line and Marlow Donkey for more information. The hamlets soon merged into what is now known as Bourne End, as did Well End and Coldmoorholme in the neighbouring parish of Little Marlow. Both a church and school were built at the turn of the century for the residents' convenience. The Parade became established as the focal point of the village for shops and services. In the 1920s Bourne End became home for two distinguished literary figures; Enid Blyton, a perennially popular children's writer, moved into Old Thatch on Coldmoorholme Lane, and Edgar Wallace, a prolific crime author and dramatist, bought Chalklands off Blind Lane. Another resident at this time was Louis Bl√©riot, the French aviator and aircraft builder, who lived at New York Lodge beside the Thames.Christopher Winn: I Never Knew That about the Thames (London: Ebury Press, 2010), p. 112. The Royalty Cinema opened in The Parade in 1934. The late 1940s saw extensive development in Bourne End, of the Chalklands estate and the Council Estate north of The Parade. The 1960s saw the building of the Community Centre and Library in Wakeman Road after some years of local campaigning. The Beeching Axe hit the village in 1969, as it was announced that the line between Bourne End and High Wycombe would be closed. The track bed was lifted soon after closure in 1970. A commercial estate was developed adjacent to the station, though most of the course taken by the railway remains as a footpath between the village and Wooburn. Today =Locale= Bourne End lies between the M4 and M40 motorways, and retains its railway station on the Maidenhead to Marlow Branch Line. With rail and road accessibility to London, it has become a popular place for commuters to live. All of the mills along the Wye Valley have now been shut down and demolished, Jacksons Mill in Furlong Road being the last (in Bourne End) in the late 1980s. These have been replaced by houses, offices or industrial estates, which has led to the continuation of the village as an employment centre. Bourne End remains a distinct settlement, although the continued house-building over the past century means it is threatened by the evident ribbon development, through to High Wycombe. In 1997, when the Local Plan was in preparation, the Residents Associations of Bourne End and Wooburn successfully lobbied to stop Slate Meadow (the field which separates the two settlements) being designated for housing for the time being. Other undeveloped land around the village looks likely to remain so, as it has been specified as Green Belt, an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty, a Site of Special Scientific Interest, or a combination of the three. In parts, Bourne End is surrounded by farmland. Somewhat further away, Cliveden and Hedsor overlook the village from higher ground to the south east. =Community= Bourne End sustains many businesses and services whilst still retaining a village-like atmosphere. There is a Community Centre in the centre of the village, with a large hall, function rooms and a bar, which is open for member's use. It is, for many, considered the focal point of village activity. In the early 2000s, a Twinning Association was established, and subsequently Octeville-sur-Mer, a town on the north coast of France, was chosen to be its twin town. Frequent events are held by members of the association to foster and enhance the relationship between the two settlements. =Administration and services= The local government of the village is made up of three tiers. Wooburn and Bourne End Parish Council (formerly Wooburn Parish Council, until 2005), based in Wooburn; Wycombe District Council, based in High Wycombe; and Buckinghamshire County Council, based in Aylesbury. The local police force is Thames Valley Police, who have an office in Boston Drive from which the local constables operate. Local healthcare services are commissioned by Buckinghamshire Primary Care Trust (PCT); GPs operate from The Hawthornden Surgery in Wharf Lane, and The Orchard Surgery in Station Road. Pound House Surgery at Wooburn Green is part of the same group of practices and nurses and other medical staff operate between all three. There are two dentists, the Bourne End Dental Practice, and Advance Dental Services, both in Station Road. Leisure Bourne End Marina on the River Thames The village has two recreation grounds (Furlong Road and Blind Lane), riverside open space at the marina and Spade Oak Reach, a Junior Sports Club and fitness centre and the long-established Upper Thames Sailing Club. For many residents and visitors alike, the river is the central attraction of Bourne End, and many leisure pursuits involve or revolve around it. The Sailing Club traditionally host a week-long regatta every year in June, known as Bourne End Week. Bourne End hosts a number of restaurants of varying cuisines. There are also a number of public houses. Near Bourne End, across the River Thames, is Cock Marsh, an area of common land and floodplain owned by the National Trust. It is a Site of Special Scientific Interest and includes a prehistoric burial mound. Cock Marsh is accessible via the footbridge attached to the railway bridge over the river, and footpaths continue to Cookham, Cookham Dean and beyond. The Thames Path National Trail follows the River Thames through Bourne End; upstream on the Buckinghamshire side, crossing the river at the footbridge, and downstream through Berkshire. Education Bourne End has three schools: *Westfield School, on Highfield Road, a special school which was the village First School until 1995. *Claytons Primary School, in Wendover Road, the village junior school which was formerly a Middle School and was merged with Westfield. *Bourne End Academy, in New Road, an upper school which has specialist Sports College status. Before its amalgamation with Pembroke School, Flackwell Heath, in 1985, this was known as Deyncourt School, and subsequently as Wye Valley School until 2014. From late 2012 to late 2014, the school was suffering from poor results in OFSTED evaluations, and was ultimately placed into Special Measures and given the academy status. There are a number of pre-schools and nurseries across the village. Religion The village currently has three active churches. The Anglican parish church, in Station Road, is dedicated to St Mark. It was built in 1889 as a daughter church of St Paul's, Wooburn. The Roman Catholic church of St Dunstan is in the centre of the village, off Cores End Road. The longest established is the United Reformed Church in Cores End, which was founded as a Congregational Chapel in 1773, as a nonconformist alternative to St Paul's in Wooburn). Bourne End had a Methodist Church in Furlong Road, which closed in 2002. Well End once had a Congregational mission hall, in the late 19th and early 2√∂th centuries; this is now a residential house named The Chapel. Bourne End also has the only UK branch of the Ramakrishna Mission, situated at the Vedanta Centre.Vedanta Centre UK, Accessed 23 December 2012 Shopping Bourne End continues to support a bustling array of shops, chiefly in The Parade. Community events focused on the village centre, such as \\"Fun Night\\" in December, have attempted to turn residents' attention to upholding local trade and businesses. There is a small parade of shops in Furlong Road, including the main Post Office.

The Civil Parish of Winterbourne is centred on the village and includes the neighbouring communities of Winterbourne Down, Hambrook and Frenchay. To the north-east is the village of Frampton Cotterell and to the west lies the new town of Bradley Stoke. Winterbourne was recorded in the Domesday Book as Wintreborne, meaning 'Winter Stream'. Oxford Dictionary of British Place Names The village is believed to have derived its name from the nearby Bradley Brook as much of medieval Winterbourne was originally built up around St Michael's Church, which is situated near the river. St Michael's Church The modern village is largely built on top of a hill, with woodlands and fields encompassing its urban features. The River Frome flows through a scenic valley between the village and nearby Frampton Cotterell, continuing on towards Frenchay, and eventually draining via Mylne's Culvert, into the tidal Bristol Avon New Cut, to the east of what is now Gaol Ferry Bridge. The Bradley Brook divides Winterbourne from Bradley Stoke and Stoke Gifford to the west, before flowing into the Frome at Hambrook. Since the 1960s, the M4 motorway has bypassed the village to the southwest. Huckford Viaduct and Frome Valley from Cloisters The village pond, home to ducks and swans. Shelter for the ducks is provided on the islands. The Huckford Viaduct carries the Great Western Railway over the River Frome. Beneath the viaduct is the abandoned Huckford Quarry, a public nature reserve popular with dog walkers. Winterbourne is noted for its large duck pond, which overlooks the Frome Valley and is a prime spot for fishing and feeding the ducks and swans. The Parish Church is St Michael's, a building dating from the 12th century, which celebrated its 800th anniversary in 1998. Set away from the bustle of modern Winterbourne, St Michael's sits amid fields, flanked by cottages, with its prominent spire visible for miles around. At the altar a stone depiction of the Last Supper, based on the painting by Leonardo da Vinci, greets the congregation. Winterbourne Court Farm Barn is immediately adjacent to the church. This is a grade II* listed 14th century tithe barn and is an outstanding example of its type. Winterbourne has a number of pubs including the George and Dragon, the Swan and the Mason's Arms. In recent years, a number of the village's pubs have become restaurants; two of which now serve Indian cuisine. The village has three social hubs: St Michael's Rooms, Fromeside Community Centre and Greenfield, which regularly host clubs, functions and other public events. The High Street Winterbourne contains branches of the Co-op and Tesco Express, a chemist, optician, a handful of dental practices and a library. Nevertheless, the attributes of a typical English village remain, with a bakery, butcher and Post Office serving the community. Horses and cattle are a common sight in the fields, notably the Cloisters area, which offers a stunning view of the Frome Valley and the Huckford Viaduct. As well as being the centre of a large civil parish, Winterbourne contains the hamlet of Watley's End, nestled on the border between Winterbourne and Frampton Cotterell. Nowadays, it is regarded as an area of Winterbourne, but a few decades ago it was considered to be a village in its own right. People with a sense of identity in Watley's End continue to refer to the busy, uphill part of the village as 'Winterbourne Hill'. Salem, the local Methodist church, is in Watley's End. Governance An electoral ward in the same name exists. This ward stretches from Winterbourne in the north west to Hambrook in the southeast. The total population of the ward taken at the 2011 census was 6,994. Schools Winterbourne contains several schools. The main primary schools are Elm Park and St Michael's, with most students going on to attend the nearby secondary school: The Ridings Winterbourne International Academy. The Ridings was formally opened by Tony Benn in 1957. Silverhill School and Day Nursery () is an independent preparatory school for children aged 6 months to 11 years. St Michael's was founded in 1813 by the abolitionists and educational reformers, Hannah More and William Wilberforce. The original school was located upstairs in the George and Dragon pub. Larger rooms were then provided in Bourne House, where the school remained until a permanent building was erected on the High Street.

Child harnesses are most commonly used with toddlers and children of preschool age, though they may also be used with older children, especially if they have special supervisory needs such as ADHD or autism. Typically, a harness consists of waist, shoulder and sometimes crotch straps with a lead (tether) or rein attaching behind. However, a simpler version consisting of a single strap connecting the child's wrist (sometimes called a wrist link) or waist to an adult is also common.  Use  Child harnesses are designed to provide safety for a child when walking by preventing them from being separated from their parent or carer. Additionally, some may be used to make a child stay seated in a stroller or high chair. Typically used for children between one and four years of age, the use of a child harness depends on a variety of factors including the age and maturity of the child, as well as any perceived dangers such as busy roads, large crowds, and potential distractions. Other factors such as neurological and health conditions may also be considered, especially for older children with special supervisory requirements. The devices are becoming more popular, which has prompted retailers to add more designs. Newer versions often include a backpack or a stuffed animal, with the lead attaching underneath, which softens the appearance.  Types  =Standard harness= A harness usually consists of a waist or chest strap, and two shoulder straps. A walking lead or rein attaches at the back or sides and is held by the parent or carer behind the child. Some harnesses can also be used to make a child stay seated in a stroller or high chair.

Usually, the loops are adjustable for size, and the strap often features an elastic section to prevent injury by absorbing shock from any sudden movements. Some wrist links use a strong coiled plastic line instead of webbing. Similar to harnesses, wrist links are normally used for children between one and four years of age, however they are sometimes used with older children who have outgrown a harness.Minett, Pamela. Child Care and Development, 7th Edn. London: Hodder Education, 2017. p.120 =Backpack harness= Backpack harnesses integrate the functions of a child harness and a backpack. Designs may be based around a basic backpack, a stuffed animal, or well-known children's entertainment character. Backpack harnesses have many of the same features as standard harnesses, but are designed to be more appealing for the child, parent, or onlookers. Similar to standard harnesses, backpack harnesses are normally used with children between one and four years of age. =Other versions= Sometimes older children and adolescents also wear harnesses but in larger sizes. This may occur in for instance in especially crowded areas, where the risk of getting lost is substantial, but also for children who have special supervision requirements due to health or behavioral conditions such as autism, ADHD, down syndrome, and other neurological disorders.The National Autistic Society, (2017) Autism Services Directory. Available: http://www.autism.org.uk/directory/resources/4262.aspx . Accessed: December 28, 2017Autism World Magazine, Resources for Special Needs Handbook (MagsWest Publishing Pty. Ltd., 2015), p.44http://www.childharness.ca/specialneedsharness.html \\"Special Needs Harness from Childharness.ca\\"  Standardisation  Within the European Union, child harnesses and reins have to fulfil standards and safety requirements as defined in EN 13210:2004. This norm applies to devices for restraining children up to 4 years of age including harnesses and wrist links for the purpose of walking or attaching them to child care articles; excluding devices that are an integral feature of other child care articles, intended for children with special needs or restraints in motorised and power driven vehicles. = General requirements = The norm refers to the general safety of toys in regards to mechanical and physical properties, sharp edges and protruding corners, small parts, and the migration of dangerous substances including heavy metals or nickel. The norm requires all straps and belts to have a minimum width of 20 mm, defines adjustment to minimal sizes for waist and shoulder straps or wrist loops, depending on the product being used from birth or from six months of age. It does not define any maximal sizes for the straps, with the exception of the walking rein not to be longer than 1200 mm. The walking rein is considered a leading rein when attached to a single point on the waist belt and a training rein when attached to both sides of the waist belt. = Strength testing = No adjustment mechanism may slip more than 20 mm when pulled 10 times with a force of 100 N. For the dynamic strength test, the harness type restraint is applied to a test dummy, consisting of a bag (300 mm x 470 mm) filled with compacted sand that is hung from a rack. The wrist link is simply hung into the rack with closed wrist loops. In all tests, the restraint is statically preloaded with a test mass of 20 kg, attached to the rein hanging down from its defined attachment point(s), via a spiral wire spring (stiffness 28000 N/m). Within the 20 kg, a dynamic load of 13 kg is moveable so it can fall 300 mm within the construction, creating a dynamic impact. The dynamic test requires the dynamic load within 5 minutes to be released 5 times to fall the 300 mm. The restraint being tested must not break, stitchings and link elements must not being damaged and the device must remain fully functional. = Instructions = Finally, the restraint has to carry durable markings referring to this norm and year (EN 13210:2004), identification of manufacturer or retailer and the product, and cleaning instructions. Instructions, in summary, have to provide certain warnings about dangerous situations, the intended age range of the child, fitting and wearing instructions, signs of wear or damage, and the information not to leave the child unattended even when harnessed. = Standards development = A new version of the standard is under preparation (currently draft prEN 13210:2019-04), in which part -1 will focus on Children's harnesses, reins and part -2 on Children's harnesses incorporating backpacks and reins.Draft BS EN 13210-2 Child care articles. - Part 2: Children's harnesses incorporating backpacks and reins - Safety requirements and test methods  Controversy  There exists a difference of opinion on the use of child harnesses, where some approve and others do not. Some adults disapprove of the use of child harnesses. Those in favor argue that both safety and freedom are improved compared to hand-holding or confinement of children to strollers. In other cases, caregivers who are experienced with children with special needs may find the practice of using child safety harnesses to encourage neglect rather than attentive childcare. Those opposed to their use prefer restraining children through hand-holding or confinement to strollers.

It is situated between the villages of Eton Wick in Berkshire, and Dorney and Dorney Reach in Buckinghamshire. The village name is Anglo-Saxon in origin and means \\"above island\\". This refers to the island in the River Thames next to the village. The Anglo-Saxon name for the village was Bufanege. Boveney was once a hamlet within the parish of Burnham, though it has long since been considered a separate village, particularly since the urban growth of nearby Slough. It became a separate civil parish in 1866, having been a chapelry before, and was part of Eton Rural District from 1894 to 1934. In 1934 the parish of Boveney was abolished, under a County Review Order, with the more urbanised part being added to Eton Urban District, and a larger, less populous part being added to the parish of Dorney. St Mary Magdalene Church, Boveney The Church of St Mary Magdalene is in a remote part of the village by the River Thames. This church was used as a location for many Hammer Horror movies which were made at nearby Bray Studios. In 1983 the church was declared redundant and vested in the care of the Friends of Friendless Churches, who repair and conserve it for visitors and local people to enjoy. In 2004 a major campaign was undertaken to repair the 14th century timber-framed tower and a further programme of repairs was planned for 2007, so the church was closed to visitors. Many TV and film companies use the village as a location. Inspector Morse episode Silent World of Nicholas Quinn and the Kevin Costner movie Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves were partly filmed here. Dorney Common, which borders the village, is one of several locations to view Windsor Castle from outside the town of Windsor itself; the large open space affords panoramic views of the castle as well as parts of Eton.

He wrote three novels, three collections of short stories, a collection of novellas, and seven volumes of essays, three of which have won National Book Critics Circle Award prizes and one of which, A Temple of Texts (2006), won the Truman Capote Award for Literary Criticism. His 1995 novel The Tunnel received the American Book Award. His 2013 novel Middle C won the 2015 William Dean Howells Medal. Early life and education William Howard Gass was born on July 30, 1924, in Fargo, North Dakota. Soon after his birth, his family moved to Warren, Ohio, a steel town, where he attended local schools. He described his childhood as an unhappy one, with an abusive, racist father and a passive, alcoholic mother; critics would later cite his characters as having these same qualities. His father had been trained as an architect but, while serving during the First World War, had sustained back injuries that forced him to take a job as a high school drafting and architectural drawing teacher. His mother was a housewife. As a boy, Gass read anything he could get his hands on. From The Shadow to The History of the French Revolution, Gass read constantly, although there were no bookstores in the town of Warren. Later he would claim that the advent of \\"pocketbooks\\" saved his literary life. He'd save up all the money he earned or obtained and, every two weeks, head down and buy as many pocketbooks as he could afford. Even though Gass was always a reader, his father disapproved of his aspirations and often berated him for it. He attended Ohio Wesleyan University after graduating from Warren G. Harding High School, where he did very well, except for some difficulties in mathematics, then served as an ensign in the Navy during World War II for three and a half years, a period he describes as perhaps the worst of his life. He earned his A.B. magna cum laude in philosophy from Kenyon College (1947). From there he entered Cornell University as a Susan Linn Fellow in Philosophy and, by 1954, had earned his PhD in that subject. While at Cornell, he studied under Max Black and, briefly, Ludwig Wittgenstein. His dissertation, \\"A Philosophical Investigation of Metaphor\\", was based on his training as a philosopher of language. In graduate school, Gass read the work of Gertrude Stein, who influenced his writing.  Teaching  Gass taught at The College of Wooster for four years, Purdue University for sixteen years, and Washington University in St. Louis, where he was a professor of philosophy (1969‚Äì1978) and the David May Distinguished University Professor in the Humanities (1979‚Äì1999). His colleagues there included the writers Stanley Elkin, Howard Nemerov (1988 Poet Laureate of the United States), and Mona Van Duyn (1992 Poet Laureate). Since 2000, Gass was the David May Distinguished University Professor Emeritus in the Humanities.  Personal life  In 1952, before graduating from Cornell, he married Mary Pat O'Kelly. The marriage ended in divorce. He had two sons and a daughter with his first wife, Richard, Robert and Susan. Gass was married to the architect Mary Henderson Gass, author of Parkview: A St. Louis Urban Oasis (2005). They had twin daughters, Catherine and Elizabeth Gass-Boshoven. Catherine is an artist teaching at The School of the Art Institute of Chicago and is a photographer for the Newberry Library. Writing and publications Earning a living for himself and his family from university teaching, Gass began to publish stories that were selected for inclusion in The Best American Short Stories of 1959, 1961, 1962, 1968 and 1980, as well as Two Hundred Years of Great American Short Stories. His first novel, Omensetter's Luck, about life in a small town in Ohio in the 1890s, was published in 1966. Critics praised his linguistic virtuosity, establishing him as an important writer of fiction. Richard Gilman in The New Republic called it \\"the most important work of fiction by an American in this literary generation.\\"The New Republic, 1966. In 1968 he published In the Heart of the Heart of the Country, five stories dramatizing the theme of human isolation and the difficulty of love. That same year Gass published Willie Masters' Lonesome Wife, an experimental novella illustrated with photographs and typographical constructs intended to help readers free themselves from the linear conventions of narrative. He also published several collections of essays, including Fiction and the Figures of Life (1970) and Finding a Form (1996). Cartesian Sonata and Other Novellas was published in 1998, and his novel Middle C was published in 2013. His work also appeared in The Best American Essays collections of 1986, 1992, and 2000. Gass cited the anger he felt during his childhood as a major influence on his work, even stating that he wrote \\"to get even.\\" Despite his prolific output, he said that writing was difficult for him. In fact, his epic novel The Tunnel, published in 1995, took Gass 26 years to write. On the subject of his slow and methodic pace he said, \\"I write slowly because I write badly. I have to rewrite everything many, many times just to achieve mediocrity.\\"William H. Gass and Theodore G. Ammon, (University of Mississippi Press. 2003) p.vii. The Tunnel on top of two of his collections of essays: \\"Habitations of the Word\\" and \\"The World Within the Word\\" Critical responses to The Tunnel upon its release included Robert Kelly's declaration that it was an \\"infuriating and offensive masterpiece,\\"New York Times, Sunday, February 26, 1995, section 7 page 1 of the New York edition. and Steven Moore's claim that it was ‚Äùa stupendous achievement and obviously one of the greatest novels of the century.‚ÄùA review of The Tunnel, in Review of Contemporary Fiction, Vol. 15, No. 1, Spring, 1995, pp. 159‚Äì60. Michael Silverblatt of the Los Angeles Times wrote in his review of the novel: \\"A bleak, black book, it engenders awe and despair. I have read it in its entirety 4¬Ω times, each time finding its resonance and beauty so great as to demand another reading. As I read, I found myself devastated by the thoroughness of the book's annihilating sensibility and revived by the beauty of its language, the complexity of its design, the melancholy, horror and stoic sympathy in its rendering of what we used to call the human condition.\\"L.A. Times Book Review, March 19, 1995 Gass, in reference to the harsh and disquieting nature of The Tunnel said \\"I don't think anything is sacred and therefore I am prepared to extol or make fun of anything. People who have very settled opinions are going to dislike this book because Kohler [the main character] is the worm inside all that stuff.\\"William H. Gass and Theodore G. Ammon, (University of Mississippi Press. 2003) p.ix. An unabridged audio version of The Tunnel was released in 2006, with Gass reading the novel himself. Gass typically devoted enormous attention to sentence construction. His prose has been described as flashy, difficult, edgy, masterful, inventive, and musical. Steven Moore, writing in The Washington Post, called Gass \\"the finest prose stylist in America.\\"\\"Maestro of the Language,\\" Washington Post, 20 September 1998, p. 5. Much of Gass's work is metafictional. In an interview with Anglistik Gass commented on the subject of his genre and form defying works, laughing off the title \\"Postmodern,\\" and coining himself \\"Late\\" or \\"Decayed Modern\\"William H. Gass and Theodore G. Ammon, (University of Mississippi Press. 2003) p.xi. Gass's opinion of metaphor > Though much of Gass's central aesthetic has remained constant, there have > been gradual shifts in his views of metaphor and ontology of the text. His > view of metaphor is far more expansive than that proposed in his > dissertation [A Philosophical Investigation of Metaphor].

In other > words, metaphor need not be a purely linguistic matter, and perhaps not > surprisingly Gass's change in his explanation of metaphor from graduate > school to now signals a change in the focus of his fiction.

Harper's described it as \\"A rich fever, a parade of secrets, delirious, tormented, terrifying, comic...one of the most exciting, energetic and beautiful novels we can ever hope to read.\\" =The Tunnel= The Tunnel is a novel about a man named William Frederick Kohler and his attempt to write an introduction to his historical magnum opus, \\"Guilt and Innocence in Hitler's Germany.\\" But when Kohler tries to flesh out this minor introduction, mostly for the purposes of gloating over his colleagues, he instead finds himself writing a deeply personal book about the history of his own life. As the novel progresses we see the lies, half-truths, violent emotions, and relative chaos of Kohler's life laid bare, and while he continues to dig away at the memories of his past he also begins digging a tunnel out from the basement where he works, a reflection of his tunneling through himself. The novel addresses ideas about history, evil, and the living and the dead. =Middle C= Middle C is the story of Joseph Skizzen, a middling professor leading a middling life in the middle of Ohio. His father got the family out of Austria before the War by pretending they were Jewish. In London during the war, the father disappeared, presumed to have escaped to Canada or the United States, and the rest of the family makes it to Ohio. As an adult, Skizzen lives with his mother and has a rich fantasy life, centered on his Inhumanity Museum and Arnold Schoenberg. Awards and honors Gass received many awards and honors, including grants from the Rockefeller Foundation in 1965, the Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation in 1970. He won the Pushcart Prize awards in 1976, 1983, 1987, and 1992, and in 1994 he received the Mark Twain Award for Distinguished Contribution to the Literature of the Midwest. In 1959 he was awarded the Longview Foundation Prize for Fiction for his story \\"The Triumph of Israbestis Tott\\" (a story later included as the first part of his novel Omensetter's Luck). Chicago Tribune Writers' and Critics' Poll named him one of the ten best American writers and one of the ten best Midwest writers in 1973. He has teaching awards from Purdue University and Washington University; in 1968 the Chicago Tribune Award as One of the Ten Best Teachers in the Big Ten. In 1975 he received the American Academy and Institute of Arts and Letters Award for Fiction. He was a Getty Foundation Fellow in 1991‚Äì1992. He received the Lannan Lifetime Achievement Award in 1997; and the American Book Award for The Tunnel in 1996. In 2000 he was honored with the PEN/Nabokov award and the PEN/Nabokov Lifetime Achievement award which he has called his \\"most prized prize.\\" Gass has received the National Book Critics Circle Award for Criticism three times, for Habitations of the Word (1985), Finding a Form (1997) and Tests of Time (2003). Gass also received the PEN/Diamonstein-Spielvogel Award for the Art of the Essay in 2003. In 2007 he was the recipient of the St. Louis Literary Award from the Saint Louis University Library AssociatesWebsite of St. Louis Literary Award Gass founded the International Writers Center at Washington University in 1990, whose purpose was to \\"build on the strengths of its resident and visiting faculty writers; to serve as a focal point for writing excellence in all disciplines and in all cultures; to be a directory for writers and writing programs at Washington University, in St. Louis, in the United States, and around the world; and to present the writer to the reader.\\" He made numerous presentations of his photography, and he has a star on the St. Louis Walk of Fame. He also served on the contributing editorial board of the literary journal Conjunctions. In 2000, Gass received the PEN/Nabokov Award. In 2003, he won the PEN/Diamonstein-Spielvogel Award for the Art of the Essay for Test of Time. In 2006, William H. Gass was a featured speaker at Lake Forest College for the 2006 &NOW; Festival and the Lake Forest Literary Festival. In Dan Simmons's science fiction novel Hyperion, Gass is referred to as \\"the twentieth century's most honoured writer\\" by the poet Martin Silenus. More recently, Gass won the 2007 Truman Capote Award for Literary Criticism in Memory of Newton Arvin. The winner of this award is chosen by a panel of six authors, and s/he also receives a cash prize of $30,000. The panel awarded Gass for his 2006 collection of essays, A Temple of Texts.

On the northwestern Hudson Bay, between Chesterfield Inlet and Arviat, it is the regional centre for the Kivalliq Region. In the 1995 Nunavut capital plebiscite, Iqaluit defeated Rankin Inlet to become territorial capital of Nunavut.  History  Archaeological sites suggest the area was inhabited around 1200 A.D. by Thule people, bowhead whale hunters. By the late 18th century, they were succeeded by Caribou Inuit who hunted the inland barren- ground caribou, and fished for Arctic char along the coast, as well as the Diane River and Meliadine River. The Hudson's Bay Company (HBC) established itself throughout the bay in the 17th century, and after 1717, sloops from Churchill, Manitoba traded north to Rankin Inlet and beyond. There was an unfortunate expedition shipwrecked on Marble Island, east of Rankin Inlet: James Knight's expedition died in the island around 1722. It was surveyed by William Moor in 1747. HBC contact was followed in the mid-19th century by American and European whalers, who were followed by fur traders trapping white fox skins in the early 20th century, followed by missionaries who brought a written language system. The town itself was founded by the owners of the Rankin Inlet Mine, just north of Johnston Cove. Starting in 1957, the mine produced nickel and copper ores from an underground operation. The mine was the first case of Inuit miners in Canada. When the mine closed in 1962, Rankin Inlet had a population of approximately 500 Inuit, and 70-80% had been mine workers. Several unsuccessful attempts followed to develop alternate sources of income for the town. These included a pig ranch in 1969 and a chicken- raising venture in the 1970s. Both animal groups were fed a diet of local fish, which gave the meat an unpleasant flavour. It was also common for the animals to freeze to death or be eaten by polar bears.History of the Development of Agriculture in the N.W.T. The Meliadine Gold Mine operated by Agnico-Eagle opened in 2019 and is expected to produce until at least 2034.  Demographics  In the 2016 Census, Statistics Canada reported that Rankin Inlet had a population of 2,842 living in 795 of its 975 total dwellings, a 10.3% increase from its 2011 Census of 2,577. With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2016.  Arts and culture  Rankin Inlet is not only notable for its artists and artisans, it is recognized as housing the only Inuit fine-arts ceramics production facility in the world.Rankin Inlet art and artists Community artists work in a variety of media including ceramics, prints, bronze castings, carvings, watercolour and drawing. The Matchbox Gallery, founded in 1987, showcases art work and provides educational resources. The community is served by Kivalliq News, a weekly newspaper which publishes in both English and Inuktitut.  Services  The community is served by the Rankin Inlet Airport, and by annual supply sealift. Groceries and household goods can be purchased at The North West Company's Northern Store or at the Kissarvik Cooperative. There are two convenience stores, one being The Red Top Variety Shop, formally the Innukshuk Shop, and the other being Kativik True Value Hardware. Both are locally owned and operated. There are several places to dine out which include The Captain's Galley (which is in the Siniktarvik Hotel), Turrarvik Inns North (Kissarvik Cooperative) and three Tim Hortons (in the Northern Store and two convenience stores)Tim Hortons hype out of line, says Nunavut restaurant-owner outlets. There is an auto parts store called Rankin Auto Value. This store has automotive and heavy equipment parts, oils and tooling.  Broadband communications  The community has been served by the Qiniq network since 2005. Qiniq is a fixed wireless service to homes and businesses, connecting to the outside world via a satellite backbone. The Qiniq network is designed and operated by SSI Micro. In 2017, the network was upgraded to 4G LTE technology, and 2G-GSM for mobile voice. Lodging Rankin Inlet has several hotels, including the Siniktarvik HotelSiniktarvik Hotel and Katimavik Suites.Katimavik Suites  Geography  Rankin Inlet is notable for the chilling wind, severe winter storms, and water resources. The Diana River empties from the north into the hamlet's namesake inlet. The small Kivalliq Region has several lakes, the largest being Nipissa Lake, and is flanked by two bays, Melvin Bay on the west and Prairie Bay on the east. Paniqtoq Peninsula, on the inlet's far western shore, provides a barrier shelter for the smaller Kivaliq Region. Dozens of islands dot the inlet, including Thomson Island, the largest, and the Barrier Islands, the longest chain. These natural resources attract tourists who hunt, fish, and canoe. The Iqalugaarjuup Nunanga Territorial Park, northwest of Rankin Inlet, is notable for hiking, fishing, bird watching and Thule archaeological sites. =Climate= Rankin Inlet has a subarctic climate (K√∂ppen climate classification Dfc), just short of a tundra climate. It is above the tree line. Temperatures stay below freezing from late September to early June. Although the climate is subarctic, temperatures rise and fall too rapidly and do not stay above for long enough (30 days) for trees to grow. Under the alternate formula for determining the boundary between Arctic and subarctic climates posited by Otto Nordenski√∂ld, however, Rankin Inlet, along with Arviat and Baker Lake, qualify as Arctic based on the relationship between the temperatures of the coldest and warmest months; in the case of Rankin Inlet, with a coldest-month (January) mean of , said boundary for the warmest month would be using the Nordenskj√∂ld formula and Rankin Inlet's warmest month (July) averages only . Beginning on January 16, 2008, Rankin Inlet endured the longest recorded blizzard in Canada.Environment Canada defines a blizzard as a snowstorm with sustained wind speed above , visibility below and conditions will last for at least six hours. Blizzard Wind speed was or above, with gusts to , and wind chill values were as low as . This blizzard lasted 7 days 5 hours.

R. Millar, c. 1905. In Irish mythology, Ethniu (), or Eithne () in modern spelling, is the daughter of the Fomorian leader Balor, and the mother of Lugh. She is also referred to as Ethliu (modern Eithle), Eithlionn (genitive; modern Eithleann), and Ethlinn (dative; modern Eithlinn). Name Ethniu is a fine example of the difficulty of conducting research into Irish mythology. Her oldest version of her name is probably Ethliu or Ethniu, giving rise to the modern Irish name Eithne. However thanks to changes in the Irish language, the lack of standardised spelling for many centuries, and attempts to anglicise the name, variations have arisen. Linguistic ignorance has further confused the issue: the genitive form of Ethniu is Ethnenn (modern Eithneann) and the genitive of Ethliu is Ethlenn/Ethlinn (modern Eithleann/Eithlinn), as in mac Ethlenn (\\"Ethliu's son\\"). This genitive has often been taken for a nominative, or a mistaken nominative has been inferred.

In the Wooing of √âta√≠n we are told that Eithne's other name is BoandThe Wooing of √âta√≠n and in the Banshenchas Ethniu's \\"true name\\" is revealed to be Feada. Relationships Eithne is the daughter of Balor and mother of Lugh. In some traditions Eithne is the daughter of Delb√°eth, the mother of the Dagda and Ogma, and the wife of Nuada Airgetl√°m. In a variant version of the birth of Aengus, she is the wife of Elcmar who is seduced by the Dagda: as such she may be a double, and is explicitly named as such, of Boann, who plays that role in the best-known version of the tale.James MacKillop, Dictionary of Celtic Mythology, 1998, p. 155The Wooing of √âta√≠n Although in most texts she is a female figure, there are some in which Ethniu is a male name. In the ancient text Baile in Sc√°il (\\"The Phantom's Ecstatic Vision\\"), Lugh is said to the son of \\"Ethliu son of Tigernmas\\", or the son of \\"Ethniu son of Smretha son of Tigernmas\\". James BonwickJames Bonwick, Irish Druids and Old Irish Religions, 1894 identifies Tigernmas, the king who introduced the worship of Crom Cruach, with Balor. R. A. Stewart Macalister also suggests that Cethlenn is originally a variant of Ethlenn arising from the frequent identification of Lugh as Lugh Mac Ethlenn (thus Mac Ethlenn ‚Üí Mac Cethlenn).R. A. Stewart Macalister (ed. & trans.), Lebor Gab√°la √ârenn Vol. 4 Mythology Her union with Lugh's father, Cian of the Tuatha D√© Danann, is presented in early texts as a simple dynastic marriage,Whitley Stokes (ed. & trans), \\"The Second Battle of Moytura\\", Revue Celtique 12, 1891, p. 59 but later folklore preserves a more involved tale, similar to the birth of Perseus in Greek mythology. A folktale recorded John O'Donovan in 1835 tells how Balor, in an attempt to avoid a druid's prophecy that he will be killed by his own grandson, imprisons Ethniu in a tower on Tory Island away from all contact with men. But a man called Mac Cinnfhaelaidh, whose magical cow Balor stole, gains access to Ethniu's tower, with the magical help of the leanan s√≠dhe Bir√≥g and seduces her. Ethniu gives birth to triplets, but Balor gathers them up in a sheet and sends a messenger to drown them in a whirlpool. The messenger drowns two of the babies, but unwittingly drops one in the harbour, where he is rescued by Bir√≥g. She takes the child back to his father, who gives him to his brother, Gavida the smith, in fosterage. The boy grows up to kill Balor.John O'Donovan (ed. & trans.), Annala Rioghachta √âireann: Annals of the Kingdom of Ireland by the Four Masters Vol. 1, 1856, pp. 18‚Äì21, footnote S By comparison with texts like Cath Maige Tuired and the Lebor Gab√°la √ârenn, the unnamed boy is evidently Lugh, and his father, Mac Cinnfhaelaidh, is a stand-in for Cian.T.

Rolleston, Myths and Legends of the Celtic Race, 1911, pp. 109‚Äì112; Augusta, Lady Gregory, Gods and Fighting Men, 1094, pp. 27‚Äì29The Banshenchas states that her real name was Feada- \\"Feada was the real name of noble Ethne who was wife of strong stout Cain, and mother of Lug the impetuous superman, and daughter of swift smiting Balor son of Dod son of mighty Net a greater man than pleasant Hector. From him is famed the cairn at Ath Feindead because he fought a duel.\\" The Fosterage of the Houses of the Two Methers has St. Patrick saying of Eithne: > I shall leave these virtues for the story of Eithne from the fair Maigue. > Success in children, success in foster-sister or brother, to those it may > find sleeping with fair women.

It is near Saunderton, off the main A4010 road between Princes Risborough and High Wycombe.  Village  Bluebells in Bradenham Woods, Buckinghamshire The village name is Anglo-Saxon and means 'broad enclosure', referring to the fact that the village sits in a broad valley among the surrounding Chiltern Hills. In the Domesday Book of 1086, the village was recorded as Bradeham. The Parish Church of St Botolph was restored in 1863 by G.E. Street and the south door dates from the early Norman period. The rectory on the main road is from the 18th century. The houses around the village green are mainly brick and flint, but include the distinctive 18th century stuccoed 'White House' with pointed windows and castellations. There is a pub on the main road called the Red Lion. The whole village of Bradenham has been owned by the National Trust since 1956. They market it under the name Bradenham Village. In front of the manor house is a small, slightly sloping cricket pitch which is used by Bradenham Cricket Club. Village news and activities are documented in the monthly \\"Contact\\" magazine, which covers Bradenham plus the nearby villages of Bledlow Ridge, West Wycombe, Radnage and Piddington. =Royal Air Force= RAF High Wycombe is inside the village, to the north-east. The Strike Command Operations Centre (STCOC) formerly the Primary War Headquarters (PWHQ) bunker was built by RAF Strike Command on the National Trust land to the north east of the village between 1983 and 1985, in spite of opposition including a peace camp.  Manor house  Bradenham Manor Bradenham is the location of a grand red brick manor house, which in the 13th century was a property belonging to the Earl of Warwick. The house was fit for royalty, as in 1566 Queen Elizabeth I was entertained here by Lord Windsor. The current manor house was substantially built by Sir Edmund Pye, 1st Baronet around 1670 with tall sash windows, steep roofs and slim brick chimneys. In the 19th century it was the home of Isaac D'Israeli who died there in 1848 and is buried in the church. His son Benjamin Disraeli, who became the prime minister, lived there for part of his early life. In the later Victorian era, the house was turned into a boarding school for local young gentlemen. Bradenham Manor is currently leased by the National Trust to Grant Thornton UK LLP as the firm's National Training Centre. It is well known for its gardens. It featured as the 'Wargames Headquarters' in the 1967 film, The Dirty Dozen.

The group cites various studies estimating that in the United States, between 2.3% and 5% of all prisoners are innocent. The Innocence Project was founded in 1992 by Barry Scheck and Peter Neufeld. Scheck and Neufeld gained national attention in the mid-1990s as part of the so-called \\"Dream Team\\" of lawyers who formed part of the defense in the O. J. Simpson murder case. As of November 17, 2019, the Innocence Project has worked on 189 successful DNA-based exonerations. Founding The Innocence Project was established in the wake of a study by the United States Department of Justice and United States Senate, in conjunction with the Jewish Yeshiva University's Benjamin N. Cardozo School of Law, which claimed that incorrect identification by eyewitnesses was a factor in over 70% of wrongful convictions. The original Innocence Project was founded in 1992 by Scheck and Neufeld as part of the Cardozo School of Law of Yeshiva University in New York City. It became an independent 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization on January 28, 2003,\\"The Innocence Project, Inc.\\" New York State Division of Corporations: Entity Information. Retrieved December 10, 2019. but it maintains institutional connections with Cardozo . , the executive director of the Innocence Project is Madeline deLone. The Innocence Project has become widespread as countries are using scientific data to overturn wrongful convictions and in turn freeing those wrongly convicted. One such example exists in the Republic of Ireland where in 2009 a project was set up at Griffith College Dublin. Mission The Innocence Project focuses on cases in which DNA evidence is available to be tested or retested. DNA testing is possible in 5‚Äì10% of criminal cases. Other members of the Innocence Network also help to exonerate those in whose cases DNA testing is not possible. In addition to working on behalf of those who may have been wrongfully convicted of crimes throughout the United States, those working for the Innocence Project perform research and advocacy related to the causes of wrongful convictions. Some of the Innocence Project's successes have resulted in releasing people from death row. The successes of the project have fueled American opposition to the death penalty and have likely been a factor in the decision by some American states to institute moratoria on criminal executions. In District Attorney's Office v. Osborne (2009), US Supreme Court Chief Justice Roberts wrote that post-conviction challenge \\"poses questions to our criminal justice systems and our traditional notions of finality better left to elected officials than federal judges.\\" In the opinion, another justice wrote that forensic science has \\"serious deficiencies\\". Roberts also said that post-conviction DNA testing risks \\"unnecessarily overthrowing the established system of criminal justice.\\" Law professor Kevin Jon Heller wrote: \\"It might lead to a reasonably accurate one.\\" =Overturned convictions= , 367 people previously convicted of serious crimes in the United States had been exonerated by DNA testing since 1989, 21 of whom had been sentenced to death. Almost all (99%) of the wrongful convictions were males, with minority groups constituting approximately 70% (61% African American and 8% Latino). The National Registry of Exonerations lists 1,579 convicted defendants who were exonerated through DNA and non-DNA evidence from January 1, 1989, through April 12, 2015. According to a study published in 2014, more than 4% of persons overall sentenced to death from 1973 to 2004 are probably innocent. The following are examples of notable exonerations: * In 2003, Steven Avery was exonerated after serving 18 years in prison for a sexual assault charge. After his release, he was convicted of murder. * In 2004, Darryl Hunt was exonerated after serving 19 1/2 years in prison of a life sentence for the rape and murder of a newspaper copy editor, Deborah Sykes.Zerwick, Phoebe (2003) \\"Murder, Race, Justice: The State vs. Darryl Hunt\\" Journal Now * In 2007, after an investigation begun by the Innocence Project, James Calvin Tillman was exonerated after serving 16 1/2 years in prison for a rape he did not commit. His sentence was 45 years.James Tillman ‚Äì 17 Years in Prison: Innocent Innocence Project * In 2014, Glenn Ford was exonerated in the murder of Isadore Newman. Ford, an African American, had been convicted by an all- white jury without any physical evidence linking him to the crime and with testimony withheld. He served 30 years on death row in Angola Prison before his release. Work The Innocence Project originated in New York City but accepts cases from any part of the United States. The majority of clients helped are of low socio-economic status and have used all possible legal options for justice. Many clients hope that DNA evidence will prove their innocence, as the emergence of DNA testing allows those who have been wrongly convicted of crimes to challenge their cases. The Innocence Project also works with the local, state and federal levels of law enforcement, legislators, and other programs to prevent further wrongful convictions. About 3,000 prisoners write to the Innocence Project annually, and at any given time the Innocence Project is evaluating 6,000 to 8,000 potential cases. All potential clients go through an extensive screening process to determine whether or not they are likely to be innocent. If they pass the process, the Innocence Project takes up their case. In almost half of the cases that the Innocence Project takes on, the clients' guilt is reconfirmed by DNA testing. Of all the cases taken on by the Innocence Project, about 43% of clients were proven innocent, 42% were confirmed guilty, and evidence was inconclusive and not probative in 15% of cases. In about 40% of all DNA exoneration cases, law enforcement officials identified the actual perpetrator based on the same DNA test results that led to an exoneration. =Funding= The Innocence Project, as of June 2018, receives 55% of its funding from individual contributions, 16% from foundations, 16% from events, 8% from investments, and the remainder from corporations, Yeshiva University, and other sources. Innocence Network The Innocence Project is a founder of the Innocence Network, an organization of law and journalism schools, and public defense offices that collaborate to help convicted felons prove their innocence. 46 American states along with several other countries are a part of the network. In 2010, 29 people were exonerated worldwide from the work of the members of this organization. The Innocence Network brings together a growing number of innocence organizations from across the United States, as well as including members from other English-speaking common law countries: Australia, Canada, Ireland, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom. In South Africa, the Wits Justice Project investigates South African incarcerations. In partnership with the Wits Law Clinic, the Julia Mashele Trust, the Legal Resource Centre (LRC), the Open Democracy Advice Centre (ODAC), the US Innocence Project, and the Justice Project investigate individual cases of prisoners wrongly convicted or awaiting trial. Causes of wrongful conviction There are many reasons why wrongful convictions occur. The most common reason is false eyewitness identification, which played a role in more than 75% of wrongful convictions overturned by the Innocence Project. Often assumed to be incontrovertible, a growing body of evidence suggests that eyewitness identifications are unreliable. Another cause for misidentification is when a \\"show-up\\" procedure occurs. This is when a suspect is shown at the scene of a crime in a poorly lit lot or in a police car. Someone might also misidentify when they learn more about the suspect; it may cause them to change their description.Kassin, S.M., Drizin, S. A., Grisso, T., Gudjonsson, G.H., Leo, R.A., & Redlich, A.D. (2010). Police-induced confessions: Risk factors and recommendations. Law and Human Behavior, 34, 3-38 (Official White Paper of the American Psychology-Law Society). Unreliable or improper forensic science played a role in some 50% of Innocence Project cases. Scientific techniques such as bite-mark comparison, once widely used, are now known to be subjective. Many forensic science techniques also lack uniform scientific standards. In about 25% of DNA exoneration cases, innocent people were coerced into making false confessions. Many of these false confessors went on to plead guilty to crimes they did not commit (usually to avoid a harsher sentence or even the death penalty). Government misconduct, inadequate legal counsel, and the improper use of informants also contributed to many of the wrongful convictions since overturned by the Innocence Project.

In the 6th century, its name was spelt Brotone, which is still its customary pronunciation. The original Northampton to London turnpike came through the village (to join Watling Street [now the A5 road] near Woburn).'Parishes : Broughton' ‚Äì Victoria History of the Counties of England, A History of the County of Buckingham: Volume 4 (1927), pp. 303‚Äì308. Date accessed: 24 August 2009 The current main route, the M1 motorway, is very near and Junction 14 is barely half a mile away from the original village centre. The Milton Keynes grid road, Portway (H5), forms the district's northern boundary and Tongwell Street (V11) provides its western. The section of the old turnpike, once the A50, is now part of the A5130. The original route through centre of the old village, named 'London Road', was bypassed in the early 1970s, the newer route runs between it and another MK district, Brook Furlong, and provides the eastern boundary. Finally, Chaffron Way (H7), provides the southern boundary: in mid-2009 this was extended to meet the A5130 and was opened to traffic in March 2010. The district can be split into at least three areas. The original Broughton village forms part of a conservation area at the northern end, bounded by the brook and the A5130. Broughton Atterbury is an area of new build housing, predominantly between the Western side of the brook and the V11 grid road: this area has recently been completed and is awaiting final road surfacing. Broughton Gate is a new area, part of the Milton Keynes Eastern Expansion area and covers the area to the East of the brook. The iconic cable-stayed bridge is one of two main road crossing across Broughton Brook, the third and newest is the newly completed H7 extension between Broughton and the neighbouring district of Kingston. Education Broughton Fields primary school and Brooklands Farm primary school serve the area, whilst secondary education is provided by Oakgrove School in nearby Middleton and the Walton High School campus in Brooklands. In addition, Broughton Manor Preparatory school, a private prep school, is also situated near to the old village. Facilities The facilities in the area include a \\"Hungry Horse\\" chain public house, and a range of small shops, hair dressers and convenience stores. Broughton is within easy walking distance of the Milton Keynes Coachway. The Kingston Shopping Centre which includes one of the UK's larger Tesco stores, a variety of retail outlets, a branch library and a community centre is in the adjacent grid-square. A site for a community playing fields has been also been identified between the old village and the primary school. Broughton Pavilion is located on the edge of this field and hosts a variety of groups. The Broughton Brook linear park stretches the length of the brook as it travels through the area. This provides recreation space for residents. In the North end of Broughton, there is considerable open space and a conservation area. Although the population of this area has grown considerably, this open space is underused and provides a quiet retreat. Civil parish , Broughton CP operates as a joint parish council with Milton Keynes (village) CP, known as Broughton and Milton Keynes Parish Council. This part of the combined parish includes Broughton itself, Broughton Manor and Brooklands. The latter two are modern development districts that are part of the 'Eastern Expansion Area'. Consequently they have \\"city streets\\" rather than grid roads: Countess Way is a continuation of Chaffron Way (H7) but is both a local service road and a city distributor road.

Personal life A 1989 profile of actress Sandy Dennis in People says she had a live-in relationship with Eric Roberts for five years at a seven-bedroom house she rented in Connecticut.

Leaving the Wilton, Conn, house of his then girlfriend, actress Sandy Dennis, 44 at the time, Eric hopped into his doorless Jeep for a ride with her German shepherd. The dog leaned out too far. Roberts released the steering wheel to get a hold on the wayward pooch and ended up in a coma for three days.‚Äù Dennis, an animal lover who cared for a lot of dogs and cats, was relieved to learn her German shepherd was not injured in the accident.

It is Old English in origin, and refers to a place which has received a Royal charter of some description. It is not known the type of charter to which it refers in this case. Before the Norman conquest of England, the manor of Buckland was held by the Diocese of Dorchester-on-Thames in Oxfordshire under the control of Godric. After 1066 William I granted it to the Bishop of Lincoln. It remained so until the 16th century when the then tenant, the Earl of Warwick forfeited it to the Crown. By 1584 it had been passed to Robert Dormer, 1st Earl of Carnarvon. Robert was killed fighting on the Royalist side during the English Civil War at the first Battle of Newbury. His lands, including Buckland, were confiscated by the Parliamentarians but were recovered in 1653 by the Charles Dormer, 2nd Earl of Carnarvon and held until death in 1709. Through marriage it passed to Philip Stanhope, 4th Earl of Chesterfield and remained in the family until George Hassall of Cholesbury acquired it around 1815. Subsequent Lords of the Manor included John Atkinson and Peter Parott. The Church of England parish church of All Saints, Buckland was built in 1284. A Wesleyan chapel was built in 1831, although not recognised as a religious location by the authorities until 1837.

Sagres Point (', , from the Latin Promontorium Sacrum ‚ÄòHoly Promontory‚Äô) is a windswept shelf-like promontory located in the southwest Algarve region of southern Portugal. Only 4 km to the west and 3 km to the north lies Cape St. Vincent (), which is usually taken as the southwesternmost tip of Europe. The vicinity of Sagres Point and Cape St. Vincent has been used for religious purposes since Neolithic times, to which standing menhirs near Vila do Bispo, a few miles from both points, attest.  History  The promontory of Sagres has always been important for sailors because it offers a shelter for ships before attempting the dangerous voyage around Cape St. Vincent (could be Belixe Bay, between Sagres Point and the Cape, or Sagres Bay, to the east). Given the dangers of being blown onto the coastal rocks, captains preferred to wait in the lee of the point until favourable winds allowed them to continue. =Strabo= Martinhal Islets, at the Sagres Harbor entrance. Tonel Beach in Sagres There is some question whether Sagres Point, whose name derives from Sacrum Promontorium, or neighboring Cape St. Vincent, was the ancient sacred promontory. Strabo believed the promontory was the most westerly point of the \\"whole inhabited world.\\" In fact Cape St. Vincent is more westerly, but because it is further north, and Strabo's map of the Iberian Peninsula is rotated clockwise, bringing the Pyrenees into a north-south line, it could have been taken as further east. The most westerly point of the Iberian peninsula and of the European continent is Cabo da Roca, near Sintra; the southernmost, Punta de Tarifa, in Andalusia. The rocks at the base of the Cape St. Vincent lighthouse are called \\"fim do mundo\\", or \\"end of the world\\". Strabo reports (Book 3.1.4) as follows: No part of Cape St. Vincent fits this description, but on the eastern side of Sagres Point is a harbor, Baleeira, port of the modern town of Sagres, protected by four small islands in a line (the tiny Martinhal Islets) visible in satellite imagery. At the far eastern end of the beach of Martinhal, erosion of the cliffs has exposed a series of Roman pottery kilns for fabricating transport amphoras and roof tiles. =Henry the Navigator= Cannon inside the fortress When Infante Dom Henry the Navigator commenced his explorations, which would initiate the Portuguese Age of Discoveries, at his Vila do Infante, Sagres peninsula lacked the necessary requirements for such large undertakings. Fresh water was scarce, agriculture was minimal, there was a shortage of wood for shipbuilding, no deep-water landing site, and the population was small. Henry re-populated a village called Ter√ßanabal, which had been deserted due to continuous pirate attacks on the coast. The village was situated in a strategic position for his maritime enterprises and was later called Vila do Infante. Henry the Navigator employed cartographers, such as Jehuda Cresques, to help him chart the coast of Mauretania in the wake of voyages he had caused to be made to there. He also engaged an expert map and instrument-maker, Jayme of Majorca, so that his captains might have the best nautical information. This probably led to the legend of the Nautical School of Sagres (although a \\"school\\" also means a group of followers). There was no centre of navigational science or any supposed observatory, if compared to the modern definition of \\"observatory\\" or \\"navigational centre\\". The centre of his expeditions was actually at Lagos, further to the east along the Algarve coast. Later Portuguese voyages left from Bel√©m, just west of Lisbon. Plaque honoring Henry the Navigator, erected by the United States Power Squadrons. Sagres, Portugal This was a time of many important discoveries: cartography was being refined with the use of newly devised instruments, such as an improved astrolabe and improved sundial, maps were regularly being updated and extended, and a revolutionary type of vessel known as the caravel was designed. Prince Henry built a chapel next to his house in 1459, as he began to spend more time in the Sagres area in his later years. He died at Sagres on 13 November 1460. The exact location of Henry's School of Navigation is not known (it is popularly believed to have been destroyed by the 1755 Lisbon earthquake).  Fortress history  The compass rose. The 16th century bulwark-like fortress was severely damaged during the Great Earthquake of 1755. It was restored in the mid 20th century, but there is still a 16th-century turret present. After passing through the thick tunnel entrance, one sees a giant pebble compass rose (rosa dos ventos) of 43 m diameter. Normally compass roses are divided into 32 segments, but strangely this one has 40 segments (probably an error of the 20th-century restorers). It is unlikely to date back to the time of Henry the Navigator. The much-restored church Nossa Senhora da Gra√ßa dates from 1579. It replaced the original church of Infante Dom Henrique of 1459. It was also damaged by the earthquake of 1755. Some alterations to the church were made, such as the building of a new bell tower over the old charnel house of the cemetery. There are still a set of tombstones present. Inside this unpretentious church, the 17th century Baroque retable above the altar originates from the Capela de Santa Catarina do Forte de Belixe (St. Catherine's Chapel in Belixe Fortress), while the polychrome statues of St. Vincent and St. Francis were once part of the Franciscan convent on the Cape St. Vincent. Next to the church stands a replica stone standard (padr√£o), used by the explorers to claim a newly discovered territory.

His work is held by museums worldwide. Themes and style in Nerdrum's work reference anecdote and narrative. Primary influences by the painters Rembrandt and Caravaggio help place his work in direct conflict with the abstraction and conceptual art considered acceptable in much of Norway. Nerdrum creates six to eight paintings a year. They include still life paintings of small, everyday objects (like bricks), portraits and self-portraits, and large paintings allegorical and apocalyptic in nature. The figures in Nerdrum's paintings are often dressed as if from another time and place. Nerdrum was born in Helsingborg, Sweden, because his parents were resistance fighters who had fled German-occupied Norway during World War II. At the end of the war Nerdrum returned to Norway with his parents. By 1950 Nerdrum's parents had divorced leaving the mother to raise Nerdrum and his younger brother. In 1993, Nerdrum discovered his father was not his biological father; his mother had had a relationship with the architect David Sanfed. Nerdrum was born from this liaison. Nerdrum was educated in a Rudolf Steiner school and later at the Art Academy of Oslo. Disillusioned with the art form taught at the academy and with modern art in general Nerdrum began to teach himself to paint in a post modern style with Rembrandt and Caravaggio as influences. In 1965, he began a several-months study with the German artist Joseph Beuys. Nerdrum says that his art should be understood as kitsch rather than art as such. On Kitsch, a manifesto composed by Nerdrum, describes the distinction he makes between kitsch and art. Nerdrum's philosophy has spawned The Kitsch Movement among his students and followers, who call themselves kitsch painters rather than artists. Biography =Early life= Odd Nerdrum was born in Helsingborg, Sweden in 1944. His parents, Resistance fighters, had been sent to Sweden from German-occupied Norway to direct guerrilla activities from outside the country. A year later, at the end of the war, Odd and his parents moved back to Norway. Lillemor, his mother, soon after went to New York to study at the Fashion Institute of Technology. The feeling of being unwanted and abandoned Nerdrum felt at this time would stay with him until he was in his late forties, and he often felt emotionally distanced. In 1950, Nerdrum's parents divorced, leaving Nerdrum's mother, Lillemor, to raise two small children, Odd, and his younger brother. pp. 26-42 Nerdrum's father, Johan Nerdrum, later remarried. Although he was supportive of Odd, he kept an emotional distance between himself and his son. At his death, Odd was asked not to attend the funeral. He found out three years later that Johan was not his biological father. Odd, was in fact, the result of a liaison between David Sandved and Lillemor. Lillemor and Sandved had had a relationship prior to Lillemor's marriage, and this was resumed during the war in a period when Johan was absent. Richard Vine, art critic, describes this episode in Nerdrum's life as one which created \\"a conflicted preoccupation with origins and personal identity\\", that \\"came natural to Nerdrum\\" and was represented in his pictures. He would go on to make paintings about these experiences. =Early education= Nerdrum began his formal education in 1951 in Oslo, in a private Rudolf Steiner school rather than in the standard, public school system. This education would set Odd apart from his contemporaries. The system was based on anthroposophy that saw mankind as once living in harmony with the universe but now existing in a lesser state of rationality. Through spiritual or esoteric practice, Steiner believed mankind could find its way back to a connection with higher realities and to renewed harmony with the universe. Learning for students was often kinesthetic, for example, through dramatic enactments of history and fantasy, and through musical exercises that were reminiscent of the patterns found on ancient Greek vases, depicting figures moving in parallel patterns. These parallel patterns could be found in later Nerdrum work, as can a sensibility for iconographic images and costume. Jens Bj√∏rneboe, Norwegian author, and mentor said Nerdrum even at a young age exhibited tendencies of innate talent and industry, but also impatience with those with less abilities than himself. Artistic study Nerdrum began study at the Art Academy of Oslo, but became dissatisfied with the direction of modern art, notably Rauscheberg's work, and began to teach himself how to paint in a Neo Baroque style, with the guidance of Rembrandt's technique and work as a primary influence. Nerdrum had seen Rembrandt's painting, The Conspiracy of Claudius Civilis in the National Museum of Fine Arts in Stockholm. Nerdrum says seeing the painting was \\"a shock... Pervasive. Like finding home. I can say I found a home in this picture,... The wonderful thing with Rembrandt is the confidence he inspires - like when you warm your hands on a stove. Without Rembrandt I would have been so poor,\\"\\"N√• snakker Odd Nerdrum igjen\\" (\\"Now Odd Nerdrum is talking again\\") Eivind Kristensen, Dagbladet, May 11, 2010. By abandoning the accepted path of modern art, Nerdrum had placed himself in direct opposition to most aspects of the school, including his primary painting instructor, his fellow students, and a curriculum designed to present Norway as a country with an up-to-date artistic culture. He, in his own words was chased from the academy after a two-year period like a \\"scroungy mutt\\". Years later Nerdrum said, > I saw that I was in the process of making a choice that would end in defeat. > By choosing those qualities that were so alien to my own time, I had to give > up at the same time the art on which the art of our time rests. I had to > paint in defiance of my own era without the protection of the era's > superstructure. Briefly put I would paint myself into isolation.Nerdrum, > Odd.Themes: Paintings, Drawings, Prints and Sculptures, Press Publishing, > Norway, 2007.pg11 Nerdrum later studied with Joseph Beuys, at the Kunstakademie D√ºsseldorf. However, he continued to feel isolated from the other students, who nicknamed him \\"Zorn\\" from the notorious Swedish \\"flesh-painter.\\" Influences Rembrandt and Caravaggio are primary influences on Nerdrum's work, while secondary influences include Masaccio, Leonardo da Vinci, Michelangelo, Titian, and the less obvious influences, according to Vine and either mentioned by Nerdrum himself or other critics, that include Pieter Bruegel the Elder, Goya, Chardin, Millet, as well the even less apparent Henry Fuseli, Caspar David Friedrich, Ferdinand Hodler, Edvard Munch, K√§the Kollwitz, Salvador Dal√≠, Chaim Soutine and Lars Hertervig. Direction =Early work (1964‚Äì1982)= Nerdrum's work from the first twenty years of his artistic life consisted of large canvasses, generally polemic in nature, that served to refute accepted social or economic view points. The work from this period was highly representational and detailed in nature with often careful attention to contemporary references, such as in clothing, or in the model of a bicycle as in the painting The Arrest. Vine notes that, Nerdrum's influence was not, as might be expected, given the themes of the work, of the ideological Ashcan school movement, but predates the Ashcan school, although similar in subject matter. In 1968, Nerdrum had viewed for the first time the works of Caravaggio whose psychologically intense work, use of cross lighting, strongly suggested shadow that implied three dimensionality, and use of the faces of real, everyday people impacted him intensely, and provided one of the major influences for his work of this time period. He would revisit Italy and Caravaggio's work for on-going inspiration for many years. As well, Nerdrum was a reader of visionary literature that included works by Rudolf Steiner, the prophetic William Blake, the dark Dostoyevsky, and the mystical Swedenborg. This would influence him towards a more vertical sensibility rather than the linear Marxist view based on revolution that influenced most artists with socially reformist sensibilities. As a young student, Nerdrum had encountered the works of the master painters in the National Museum. In particular, Rembrandt's The Conspiracy of Claudius Civilis (1661) acted as a powerful antidote to his sensibilities. His disillusionment with modern art, such as Robert Rauschenberg's Monogram, a stuffed goat with a tire around its middle section standing on a flat, littered surface, which Nerdrum had encountered in the Museum of Modern Art in Stockholm, filled the young artist with disgust. These influences both positive and negative would impact all of Nerdrum's work. A turning point in Nerdrum's work - the end of Nerdrum's more contemporary scene-like work, and the movement towards more Rembrandt-like painting elements- revolved around the enormous (11x16¬æ foot) Refugees At Sea (1979‚Äì1980). Nerdrum, according to Vine, later considered the work to be naive in the sense that Rousseau defines the word, in which mankind is seen as innocent and innately good. In the painting Nerdrum endows the refugees, 27 Vietnamese boat people, with heroic stature, but in a highly sentimentalized manner that Nerdrum later described as \\"cloying\\". =Change in direction= In 1981 Nerdrum created a seminal work that would serve to indicate a change in direction from the sentimentalized view of Refugees at Sea to a starker, unadorned view of reality. Twilight, a rear view of a young woman alone in a wooded landscape defecating, offers nothing sentimental or ideal in its betrayal, but instead offers a stripped away view of life and reality. Paintings were no longer as multi-figured as they had been with Refugees at Sea, and still lifes were of individual objects such as a brick or loaf of bread. The individuals who now populated Nerdrum's painting were imbued with great quiet and stillness, but as Vine says, additionally, were vitally alive evoking a cosmic oneness, but yet did not transcend individuality. These figures, as types rather than endowed with features or apparent stories that might distinguish them as individual, were costumed in garments that seemed timeless: furs, skins, leather caps, rather than in clothing that would link the viewer to a specific time and place. Archetypal-like, these beings, inhabited pre-social, apocalyptic-like circumstances that included stark, severe landscapes, a reference to some place beyond our own time and space.  Painting technique  Nerdrum's approach to painting is based on traditional methods that included mixing and grinding his own pigments, working on canvas he had stretched or stretched by assistants rather than on pre-stretched canvas, and working from live models often himself, and in many cases members of his own family. In 2011, Nerdrum stated that the technique he used in the 1980s was faulty, \\"a special mixture of oils and paint in an effort to recreate the style of the old masters\\" which subsequently melted and disintegrated.Nina Berglund, \\"Artist pleads ‚Äònot guilty‚Äô to tax evasion,\\" Views and News from Norway, August 3, 2011 =Process= Of his process Nerdrum says.\\" When I paint as if I struggle in the water. I will try with all means not to drown. Sandpaper, rags, my fingers, the knife-in short everything. The brush is rarely used.\\" Drawings and prints Odd Nerdrum prints are based on his paintings. For example, an etching entitled Baby is based on a painting of the same title from 1982. Nerdrum refers to his highly finished, charcoal drawings as \\"paintings\\" Often his drawings are large in scale and are works in their own right, as well as being studies for future paintings. On kitsch Odd Nerdrum has declared himself to be a kitsch- painter identifying himself with kitsch rather than with the contemporary art world. Initially, Nerdrum's declaration was thought to be a joke but later, and with the publication of articles and books on the subject, Nerdrum's position can be seen as an implied criticism of contemporary art. Collections Odd Nerdrum's work is held in public collections worldwide including in the US: the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden in Washington, D.C. , the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York City, New York , New Orleans Museum of Art (NOMA), New Orleans Louisiana , Museum of Contemporary Art San Diego (MCASD) San Diego California , Walker Art Center, Minneapolis, Minnesota .

The trial began on 11 June.\\"Nerdrum st√§mmer norska skatteverket (Nerdrum sues the Norwegian Revenue Service)\\", Dagens Nyheter Kultur / TT Spektra, 1 March 2012. After three trial days, Nerdrum was once again convicted of tax evasion and sentenced to two years and ten months in prison. In 2013, the verdict was set aside by the Supreme Court of Norway;http://www.vg.no/rampelys/nerdrum-milliontap-paa- fransk-slott/a/10123730/Anker til h√∏yesterett (Appeals to the Supreme Court), (Dagbladet, Article in Norwegian), 29 June 2012. in 2014 court of appeals found him guilty of tax evasion and he was sentenced to 20 months in prison; 8 months were suspended.http://www.aftenposten.no/kultur/Odd-Nerdrum-domt-til- fengsel-for-skattesvik-86568b.html Under Norwegian law, Nerdrum would be forbidden from any painting activity in prison, as prisoners in Norway are not allowed to pursue business activities while incarcerated. In October 2012, Nerdrum lost a suit filed against the regional tax authority. The Oslo court ruled that the funds that Nerdrum had set aside in Austria did not constitute a 'loan, security, depot or committed funds' and should have been disclosed as income. In September 2017 Nerdrum was pardoned by King Harald of Norway. Nerdrum's work as inspiration A 2000 horror film, The Cell, contains a scene that was heavily influenced by Nerdrum's 1989 painting Dawn. The scene features three identical figures sitting down, looking upwards with pained, trance-like expressions on their faces. Director Tarsem Singh in the film's audio commentary says that the painting was the inspiration for the scene's imagery. Singh had seen the painting while visiting the owner of the painting, David Bowie.\\"Nerdrum kopiert i Lopez-thriller\\" (\\"Nerdrum copied in Lopez thriller\\"), Jon Sel√•s, Verdens Gang, Sep 8 2000 Australian choreographer, Meryl Tankard's 2009 dance piece, The Oracle, was inspired by the work of Nerdrum. The work, featuring the dancer Paul White, was about the human being in constant struggle with forces outside of itself. The Norwegian classical composer Martin Romberg wrote a collection of piano pieces inspired by three of Nerdrum's works in 2014, named Tableaux Kitsch. The pieces are inspired by the paintings To the Lighthouse, Stranded, and Drifting, and was premiered at Nerdrum's exhibitions in Paris 2013 and Barcelona 2016.

Hetherington served over 24 years in custody, which he claims is due partly to exceptional hindrances in appealing the claimed injustices in the sentence. On October 27, 2009, Hetherington was finally granted a parole.http://www.state.mi.us/mdoc/asp/otis2profile.asp?mdocNumber=186155 A 1994 article in Insight Magazine drew attention to claims that he was either incorrectly found guilty, or grossly over-sentenced, and denied due process of law applicable to his defense. Background William and Linda Hetherington married in 1971; the marriage was an unhappy one and between 1978 and 1985 William sought divorce, then the couple reconciled, and finally divorce was sought again. During this period, Linda brought, then withdrew, charges of spousal rape more than once, with one such incident described by an article in Insight Magazine as \\"the first of several times that Linda would accuse her husband of raping her, at times when bringing charges was to her advantage\\". In May 1985 following Linda's travelling without notice to another state, divorce was filed. It was expected that Hetherington would win custody due to Linda's history of abandonment of the children and family, for a period of more than two months. In August, Linda claimed he had raped her a month earlier and he was imprisoned briefly. Although released shortly afterwards, the timing caused custody to be given to Linda, with the judge commenting that custody would have gone to William had he not been incarcerated at the time of the hearing, but that he could apply later for custody instead. A month later, after William was released, he applied for custody. A hearing was set for October 7, but before this could take place, Linda again accused him of rape, claiming he had taped and tied her up, threatened that she was about to \\"meet her maker\\", abducted her by car, cut her clothing off, and raped her. According to William she invited sexual intercourse at her mother's home where she was staying, then began demanding money she believed he had. After some confusion, according to \\"several witnesses\\", Linda's mother insisted charges were pressed. Initial conviction County prosecutor Robert Weiss was responsible for prosecuting the case. He also reinstated the August case that had been dropped, and a bail bond was set at $500,000. With his assets frozen during the divorce, and his income being disability payments, William was unable to obtain bail, and unable to finance a legal defence. The court considered him to have assets, and no lawyer was provided for him as a result. Linda visited the prosecutor; stories vary at this point as to whether or not she sought charges to be dropped, and whether she was relieved or reluctant they were not. Eventually William persuaded an attorney, David Wright, to represent him, for a $10,000 fee to be paid from his disability checks. As trial approached in May 1986, the prosecutor offered a plea bargain, that if he pleaded guilty to a single charge of first degree rape, and a court- appointed psychologist concluded that he was not a danger to his ex-wife, he would receive a delayed sentence of 11 months, or probation with credit for time served. Williams claims the offer was made coercively. The article in Insight Magazine is sharply critical of the evidence. A pelvic examination of Linda three hours after the incident showed no evidence of forcible injury, described as \\"very unusual\\" in a rape case by the doctor. Although police officers stated that possible adhesive tape traces were visible on her face, doctors examining her found that no traces of that kind existed, and the scissors alleged to be used to cut the tape showed no adhesive traces either. Other evidence - the tape, gloves and underwear - was said by Linda to have been flushed down the toilet by her assailant. A neighbor, Reinhardt, added further evidence that contradicted the story - that William's car had been at the location Linda alleged she was abducted and therefore she had known he was there (she claimed she had not known), and that during the time of the rape she had left the house to get something from the car, then returned to the house to talk further. Sperm was found in Linda's clothing; however William had previously had a vasectomy, a form of sterilization which makes a man incapable of emitting sperm. The court-appointed psychiatrist was supportive of William's case. Lacking prior record, sentencing guidelines at the time were 6 to 10 years (average time served by a convicted rapist in Michigan is 5 yearshttp://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1571/is_n31_v10/ai_15674644/pg_4 - \\"So far [as at 1994], William has been in prison for nine years -- almost twice the time served by the average convicted rapist in Michigan.\\"), and this was reinforced by a \\"highly favourable\\" report that concluded William's personality seemed to \\"substantiate his explanation of what has occurred\\", and that \\"this is not a man who would force himself sexually or hostilely on another individual ... He does not appear to be an individual who is dangerous for society.\\" There was also suspicion that the prosecution was motivated by other factors. Conservative commentator Phyllis Schlafly claimed that Weiss, who was running for the Michigan Supreme Court at the time, was \\"grandstanding for the feminist vote.\\" Insight Magazine wrote: > In the midst of running for the Michigan Supreme Court, Weiss made a > dramatic statement in which he asserted that 'murder may have been less > harmful' than William's acts. He also painted a picture of a grislier crime > than the one in question: 'He raped her four times at a minimum, on a single > day ... every opening of her body, every cavity, had been invaded > violently.' (The charges involved one act of forced oral sex and one act of > vaginal penetration, with no allegations of anal intercourse.) Urging the > court to 'Let the women of this world know this is not tolerated,' he asked > for a sentence of 30 to 60 years.\\" Likewise the judge, Thomas Yeotis, discredited the psychiatrists view on the grounds that \\"you make a nice appearance, and yet, there's something about you that disturbs me.\\" The psychiatrist was one whose opinion the judge is said to have \\"relied on\\" for 20 years before, and continued to do so after.

This story is repeated in Part 2 of a biographical article on Grothendieck in Notices of the American Mathematical Society. As a semiprime, 57 is a Blum integer since its two prime factors are both Gaussian primes. 57 is a 20-gonal number. It is a Leyland number since 25 \\\\+ 52 = 57. 57 is a repdigit in base 7 (111). There are 57 vertices and 57 hemi-dodecahedral facets in the 57-cell, a 4-dimensional abstract regular polytope.

The 275-acre prison is located in Del Norte County, California. The prison takes its name from a shallow bay on the Pacific coast, about 2 miles (3 km) to the west. The prison lies in a detached section of Crescent City, several miles north of the main urban area and just south of the Oregon border. PBSP's primary purpose is to house violent male prisoners from the California state prison system; 40% of Pelican State's inmates are serving life sentences and nearly all have histories of violence at other California prisons which resulted in their transfer to Pelican Bay. The sole exception are the institution's minimum security inmates, who work as part of the prison's outside maintenance and firefighter programs. Facilities A and B are designated as Level IV, General Population (GP) facilities with two-man cells. Facility-C, Restricted Housing (RH), consist of the only remaining, dedicated long-term Security Housing Units (SHU), C-7 through C-12, in the state. In addition to the supermax population, RH also consist of Administrative Segregation (Ad/Seg) housing units, C-1 through C-6 and Short Term Restrictive Housing (STRH) Facility-D is designated as a Level II Facility. There is also a collocated 400-bed Level I, Minimum Security unit (outside of the secure perimeter) which provides inmate orderlies for general service tasks at and around the main prison. Facilities Location of Crescent City in Del Norte county and location of Del Norte in California Pelican Bay opened in 1989. Pelican Bay's grounds and operations are physically divided. Half of the prison holds Level IV (maximum security) inmates in a General Population (GP) environment with outside exercise courts and yards. The other half of the prison contains the prisons best-known feature: an X-shaped cluster of white buildings and barren ground known as the Security Housing Unit, or SHU.Corey Weinstein and Eric Cummins, \\"The Crime of punishment: Pelican Bay Maximum Security Prison\\", in Criminal Injustice, ed. Elihu Rosenblatt, South EndPress, 1996. An electric fence surrounds the entire perimeter. The cells of the SHU are made of smooth, poured concrete with perforated cell fronts and doors. There are no windows located within the cells. Instead, there are fluorescent lights, which the inmates can control. SHU inmates are confined to their assigned cells for up to twenty-three hours a day, looking out through a perforated steel door at a solid concrete wall. Food is delivered by correctional officers twice a day (breakfast, sack lunch, and dinner), through a slot in the cell door. Each of the twelve (12) housing units located in Facility-C, RH have an armed correctional officer in a control booth. Control booths are located in the center of each housing unit. The control officer can view into all six pods in the housing unit, from his or her central vantage point. The control officer controls the doors throughout the housing unit, which contains six pods. Each pod contains eight cells. The officer can supervise the release of inmates assigned to the housing unit. The control officer can allow one, or two inmates, if they are cell mates (cellies), out of their assigned cell to shower or exercise. Inmates are allowed to exercise for up to ten hours of court-mandated outdoor exercise per week. Exercise takes place in a concrete yard, which extends the length of three cells, and has a roof partially open to the sky. As of April 30, 2020, Pelican Bay was incarcerating people at 109.6% of its design capacity, with 2,608 occupants. =Psychological effect= Inmates, their lawyers, and prisoner advocate groups have argued that confinement in the SHU is cruel and unusual punishment, due to severe conditions. Contrary to popular belief, the SHU is not composed of solitary confinement cells. Inmates housed in the same pod can talk with each other and even see each other when released from their assigned cells. RH, SHU and Ad/Seg consists of twelve (12) housing units, with six pods per housing unit and eight cells per pod. Some psychiatrists and psychologists who support inmates housed in the SHU have described a \\"SHU syndrome\\",http://solitarywatch.com/tag/shu- syndrome/https://openscholarship.wustl.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1362&context;=law_journal_law_policya condition which, they say, affects inmates who spend more than a few months in isolation. The symptoms reportedly resemble those of post-traumatic stress disorder, including hallucinations, depression, anxiety, anger, and suicide.Haney, Craig. \\"Mental Health Issues in Long-Term Solitary and 'Supermax' Confinement\\", Crime and Delinquency, Vol. 49 No. 1, at 124‚Äì156 (January 2003) The cause of most of these symptoms is isolation; most SHU inmates experience isolation for 23 hours a day with limited human contact other than receiving meals through a slot in the cell door. =Hunger strikes= PBSP, SHU prisoners have organized hunger strikes in protest of conditions there, chiefly the punishment of solitary confinement. In 2002, a reported 60 SHU inmates began a hunger strike. Another hunger strike was reported to have begun on July 1, 2011. The California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation (CDCR) reported that \\"less than two dozen\\" were refusing food. The CDCR subsequently stated that 6,600 inmates had refused food in the first days of the strike, and that after five days, more than 2,000 remained on strike. Most inmates reportedly consumed food purchased from the canteen; however, others were refusing all food with the stated intention to strike indefinitely. On July 8, 2013, inmates resumed the July 2011 hunger strike, alleging a failure to uphold promises on the part of the CDCR, with upwards of 29,000 prisoners across California joining in the hunger strike. Strikers demanded reform to \\"cruel\\" policies used to identify and subsequently isolate or punish alleged gang members, including lengthy solitary confinement, as well as quality of living improvements. =Lawsuit and termination of unlimited isolation policy= In May 2012, California's prison system faced a lawsuit from the Center for Constitutional Rights, Legal Services for inmates with Children, and other California attorneys on behalf of ten men incarcerated in the SHU. The plaintiffs were all housed in the SHU for 11 to 22 years, some having been transferred directly from other SHUs. The suit claims that the inmates \\"have been incarcerated California‚Äôs Pelican Bay State Prison's Security Housing Unit (\\"SHU\\") for an unconscionably long period of time without meaningful review of their placement\\", that \\"California's uniquely harsh regime of prolonged solitary confinement at Pelican Bay is inhumane and debilitating\\", and that \\"[t]he solitary confinement regime at Pelican Bay violates the United States Constitution's requirement of due process and prohibition of cruel and unusual punishment\\". In August, 2015, as a result of the aforementioned class-action lawsuit, California agreed to end its unlimited isolation policy. Inmates are no longer isolated as a preventive measure; only those who commit new crimes while incarcerated are eligible for up to five years of isolation. Since the lawsuit's settlement, hundreds of inmates who had served years in Pelican Bay's SHU have been transferred to other prisons and are now doing their time in general population settings. The result has been the virtual depopulation of the entire SHU program, and it is anticipated by some experts the SHU program may soon be disbanded entirely.  Notable inmates  *Hugo Pinell: One of six inmates infamous for their 1971 escape attempt from San Quentin State Prison that left six people dead. Spent 43 years in long-term confinement (23 of those years were spent in the SHU) - longer than any other inmate in California. Was stabbed to death during a riot at California State Prison, Sacramento, just two weeks after being released from the SHU into the general population. *Bryan Oliver: Taft Union High School shooter, serving 27 year and 4 month sentence for attempted murder and assault with a deadly weapon.https://inmatelocator.cdcr.ca.gov/Details.aspx?ID=AW0244 * Joe \\"Pegleg\\" Morgan: First non-Hispanic Mexican Mafia member, sentenced to life in prison for murder in 1956.

He helped organize the 2013 hunger strike. * Robert Walter Scully: Aryan Brotherhood member who murdered a deputy during a traffic stop and took a family hostage in March 1995 only five days after being paroled from Pelican Bay. Sentenced to death at San Quentin in 1997. * Lloyd Avery II: Actor most famous for his role in Boyz n the Hood, sentenced in 2005 to life imprisonment for double homicide. In September 2005, he was beaten and strangled to death by his Satan-worshiping cellmate; his body wasn't discovered for another two days. * Marion \\"Suge\\" Knight: Record producer sentenced to nine years for parole violation in 1996 and released in 2001. Sentenced to 10 months in 2003 for assault and parole violation. * Charles Manson: Infamous cult leader, sentenced to life imprisonment on seven counts of murder and one count of attempted murder. In March 1997, he was charged with conspiracy to distribute narcotics and transferred to the SHU for 14 months; died in 2017 from gastrointestinal bleeding while at Corcoran State Prison. * Ricardo Medina Jr.: Actor famous for starring in Power Rangers Wild Force, sentenced to six years in prison for voluntary manslaughter for stabbing his roommate with a sword. In popular culture =Television and film= In the fictional series Life, Detective Charlie Crews spends twelve years in Pelican Bay for a triple homicide he did not commit, part of it spent in the SHU, as the background of the series' plot. In the TV series The Shield, the main character Vic Mackey regularly threatens recalcitrant suspects with only the name of the prison. Alonzo Harris (Denzel Washington) threatens gang members with a sentence in Pelican Bay and the SHU program in the movie Training Day (2001).

It was the largest women's prison in western Europe, until its closure in 2016.  History  British police began using covert photography as a means to document suffragettes in Holloway Prison under falsified names, for later identification Holloway prison was opened in 1852 as a mixed-sex prison, but due to growing demand for space for female prisoners, particularly due to the closure of Newgate, it became female-only in 1903. Before the first world war, Holloway was used to imprison suffragettes including Emmeline Pankhurst, Emily Davison, Constance Markievicz (imprisoned for her part in the Irish Rebellion), Charlotte Despard, Mary Richardson, Dora Montefiore, Hanna Sheehy-Skeffington, and Ethel Smyth. In 1959, Joanna Kelley became Governor of Holloway. Kelley ensured that long-term prisoners received the best accommodation and they were allowed to have their own crockery, pictures and curtains. The prison created \\"family\\" groups of prisoners, group therapy and psychiatrists to support some prisoners where required. In 1965, there was a change in responsibilities and the Probation Service was tasked with looking after prisoners once they had served their sentence. Kelley was not keen on the idea. With Kelley's encouragement they formed the Griffins Society. The name of the society came from the statues of two griffins that had been either side of the gates as women entered Holloway. Until 1991, the Prison was staffed by Home Office appointed, female Prison Officers. Male hospital officers from H.M.P. Pentonville were on weekly secondments until 1976. Their mission was to provide support for the agency nurses who worked in Holloway. However, The first 'Male, basic grade' Prison Officer to be posted to HMP Holloway in its history, was Prison Officer (Trg) Thomas Ainsworth, who joined the establishment direct from HMP College Wakefield in May 1991. After the death from suicide in January 2016 of inmate Sarah Reed, a paranoid schizophrenic being held on remand, the subsequent inquest in July 2017 identified failings in the care system. Shortly after Reed died, a report concluded she was unfit to plead at a trial. = Rebuilding = Holloway's Governor Joanna Kelley was promoted to Assistant Director of Prisons (Women) in 1966. In 1967, they began to rebuild Holloway Prison. The previous design had been a \\"star\\" design where a single warder could oversee many potentially troublesome prisoners and then act promptly to summon assistance. Kelley felt this was wrong as at the time most women prisoners were not violent. It was her ideas that inspired the redesigned prison based on her experience as governor. It was completed in 1977. During that time she had become an OBE in 1973. The new design allowed for \\"family\\" groups of sixteen prisoners. Her ideas were in the design of the buildings but her ideas were never enacted. The redevelopment resulted in the loss of the \\"grand turreted\\" gateway to the prison, which had been built in 1851; architectural critic Gavin Stamp later regretted the loss and said that the climate of opinion at the time was such that the Victorian Society felt unable to object.Holloway visitor centre = Use = Holloway Prison held female adults and young offenders remanded or sentenced by the local courts. Accommodation at the prison was mostly single cells; however, there was also some dormitory accommodation. Holloway Prison offered both full-time and part-time education to inmates, with courses including skills training workshops, British Industrial Cleaning Science (BICS), gardening, and painting. There was a family-friendly visitors' centre, run by the Prison Advice and Care Trust (pact), an independent charity. = Closure = The Chancellor of the Exchequer, George Osborne, announced in his Autumn Statement on 25 November 2015 that the prison would close and would be sold for housing. It closed in July 2016, with prisoners being moved to HMP Downview and HMP Bronzefield, . As of September 2017, the prison buildings still stand, with draft proposals for the site including housing, a public open green space, playground, women's centre and a small amount of commercial space.  Notable inmates  =Suffragettes= For decades, British campaigners had argued for votes for women. It was only when a number of suffragists, despairing of change through peaceful means, decided to turn to militant protest that the \\"suffragette\\" was born. These women broke the law in pursuit of their aims, and many were imprisoned at Holloway, where they were treated as common criminals, not political prisoners. In protest, some went on hunger strike and were force fed so Holloway has a large symbolic role in the history of women's rights in the UK. Suffragettes imprisoned there include Emmeline Pankhurst, Emily Davison, Constance Markievicz, Violet Mary Doudney, Katie Edith Gliddon, Isabella Potbury, Evaline Hilda Burkitt, Georgina Fanny Cheffins, Constance Bryer, Florence Tunks, Janie Terrero, Doreen Allen, Bertha Ryland, Katharine Gatty, Charlotte Despard, Janet Boyd, Genie Sheppard, Mary Ann Aldham, Mary Richardson, Alice Maud Shipley, Katherine Douglas Smith, Dora Montefiore, Christabel Pankhurst, Hanna Sheehy-Skeffington, Leonora Tyson and Ethel Smyth. In 1912 the anthem of the suffragettes - \\"The March of the Women\\", composed by Ethel Smyth with lyrics by Cicely Hamilton - was performed there. =Fascists= Holloway held Diana Mitford under Defence Regulation 18B during World War II, and after a personal intervention from Prime Minister Winston Churchill, her husband Sir Oswald Mosley was moved there. The couple lived together in a cottage in the prison grounds. They were released in 1943. Norah Elam had the distinction of being detained during both World Wars, three times during 1914 as a suffragette prisoner under the name Dacre Fox, then as a detainee under Regulation 18B in 1940, when she was part of the social circle that gathered around the Mosleys during their early internment period. Later, after her release, Elam had the further distinction of being the only former member of the British Union of Fascists to be granted a visit with Oswald Mosley during his period of detention there. =Executions= A total of five judicial executions by hanging took place at Holloway Prison between 1903 and 1955: The double execution of Sach and Walters at Holloway Prison * Amelia Sach and Annie Walters - 3 February 1903 * Edith Thompson - 9 January 1923 * Styllou Christofi - 13 December 1954 * Ruth Ellis - 13 July 1955 The bodies of all executed prisoners were buried in unmarked graves within the walls of the prison, as was customary. In 1971 the prison underwent an extensive programme of rebuilding, during which the remains of all the executed women were exhumed. With the exception of Ruth Ellis (who was reburied in the churchyard of St Mary's Church, Old Amersham), the remains of the four other women were subsequently reburied in a single grave at Brookwood Cemetery near Woking, Surrey. In 2018, the remains of Edith Thompson were reburied in her parents‚Äô grave in the City of London Cemetery. =Other inmates= Noteworthy inmates that were held at the original 1852-era prison include Oscar Wilde,https://www.timeout.com/london/blog/six-things-you-never- knew-about-holloway-103015 William Thomas Stead, Isabella Glyn, F. Digby Hardy, Kitty Byron and Lady Ida Sitwell, wife of Sir George Sitwell. More recently it housed, in 1966, Moors murderess Myra Hindley; in 1967, Kim Newell, a Welsh woman who was involved in the Red Mini Murder; also in the late 1960s, National Socialist supporter Fran√ßoise Dior, charged with arson against synagogues; in 1977, American Joyce McKinney of the \\"Manacled Mormon case\\"; Sheila Bowler, the music teacher wrongly imprisoned for the murder of her elderly aunt, was detained there before being transferred to Bullwood Hall; and in 2002, Maxine Carr, who gave a false alibi for Soham murderer Ian Huntley. Other inmates included Amie Bartholomew, Emma Last, Matthew Etherington, Alison Walder, Jayne Richards, the Tinsel Fight Murderer, Bella Coll, and Chantal McCorkle and Emma Humphreys.For Humphreys, see In 2014 disgraced judge and barrister Constance Briscoe began a 16 month sentence at the prison.https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/judge-jails-arrogant-liar- briscoe-for-16-months-92337rn5vwx  Inspections, inquiries and reports  In October 1999, it was announced that healthcare campaigner and agony aunt Claire Rayner had been called in to advise on an improved healthcare provision at Holloway Prison. Rayner's appointment was announced after the introduction of emergency measures at the prison's healthcare unit after various failures. In September 2001, an inspection report from Her Majesty's Chief Inspector of Prisons claimed that Holloway Prison was failing many of its inmates, mainly due to financial pressures. However, the report stated that the prison had improved in a number of areas, and praised staff working at the jail. In March 2002, Managers at Holloway were transferred to other prisons following an inquiry by the Prison Service. The inquiry followed a number of allegations from prison staff concerning sexual harassment, bullying and intimidation from managers. The inquiry supported some of these claims. An inspection report from in June 2003, stated that conditions had improved at Holloway Prison. However the report criticised levels of hygiene at the jail, as well as the lack of trained staff, and poor safety for inmates. A further inspection report in September 2008 again criticised safety levels for inmates of Holloway, claiming that bullying and theft were rife at the prison. The report also noted high levels of self-harm and poor mental health among the inmates. A further inspection in 2010 again noted improvements but found that most prisoners said they felt unsafe and that there remained 35 incidents a week of self-harm. The prison's operational capacity is 501. At 8 am on 11 January 2016, Sara Reed, an inmate at Holloway, was found dead in her cell. Prison staff claimed she had strangled herself in her sleep, while the Reed family call for justice. Yvonne Roberts wrote ‚ÄúSarah's final days were harrowing. She was hallucinating, chanting, without the medication she had relied on for years, sleepless, complaining a demon punched her awake at night. She was on a basic regime, punishment for what was classed as bad behaviour. In spite of her mental and physical fragility, she was isolated, the cell hatch closed, without hot water, heating or a properly cleaned cell. 'For safety and security' a four-strong 'lockdown' team of prison officers delivered basic care.‚Äù‚ÄòI sleep at peace at night because I know I fought for my daughter to the very last‚Äô The Observer Observations of Reed had been cut to only one an hour though she was obviously severely psychotic, had threatened suicide and had self harmed. Mentally ill woman died in cell after monitoring was reduced, inquest hears The Guardian A prison officer told Reed's mother, ‚ÄúWe deal with restraint and maintaining the law. We're not designed to deal with health issues.‚Äù Sarah Reed's mother: 'My daughter was failed by many and I was ignored' The Guardian The jury at her inquest decided that Reed took her own life when the balance of her mind was disturbed, but were unclear whether she had intended to kill herself. They said failure to manage her medication and the failure to complete the fitness to plead assessment in a reasonable time were factors in her death. The jury were also concerned about how Reed was monitored and claimed Reed received inadequate treatment in prison for her distress. Deborah Coles of Inquest said, ‚ÄúSarah Reed was a woman in torment, imprisoned for the sake of two medical assessments to confirm what was resoundingly clear, that she needed specialist care not prison. Her death was a result of multi-agency failures to protect a woman in crisis. Instead of providing her with adequate support, the prison treated her ill mental health as a discipline, control and containment issue.‚ÄùCare failings contributed to death of woman in prison, inquest finds The Guardian In popular culture * In Potter Payper's 2013 Album ‚ÄòTraining day‚Äô it is mentioned his mother attended Holloway prison in the song ‚ÄòPurple Rain‚Äô- ‚Äú 99 they said my mummy went on holiday, I found out my mummy was in Holloway‚Äú * The band Bush wrote a song about the prison called \\"Personal Holloway,\\" on their album Razorblade Suitcase. * Marillion's song \\"Holloway Girl\\" is on their album Seasons End. * The Kinks' \\"Holloway Jail\\" appears on Muswell Hillbillies. * Million Dead have \\"Holloway Prison Blues\\" on their album Harmony No Harmony. * One of the characters in the 1997 Canadian sci-fi/horror movie Cube is named after Holloway Prison. * In the Thames Television series Rumpole Of The Bailey episode \\"Rumpole and the Alternative Society,\\" the girl whom Rumpole was defending (until she admitted her guilt to him) was sentenced to three years imprisonment which she served at HM Holloway Prison. * In Dorothy L.

Aviation History‚ÄîDemise of the Flight Navigator, FrancoFlyers.org website, October 14, 2008. Retrieved August 31, 2014. The navigator's primary responsibility is to be aware of ship or aircraft position at all times. Responsibilities include planning the journey, advising the ship's captain or aircraft commander of estimated timing to destinations while en route, and ensuring hazards are avoided. The navigator is in charge of maintaining the aircraft or ship's nautical charts, nautical publications, and navigational equipment, and they generally have responsibility for meteorological equipment and communications. With the advent of GPS, the effort required to accurately determine one's position has decreased by orders of magnitude, so the entire field has experienced a revolutionary transition since the 1990s with traditional navigation tasks being used less frequently.  In naval occupations  Shipborne navigators in the U.S. Navy are normally surface warfare officer qualified with the exception of naval aviators and naval flight officers assigned to ship's navigator billets aboard aircraft carriers and large deck amphibious assault ships and who have been qualified at a level equal to surface warfare officers. U.S. Coast Guard officers that are shipboard navigators are normally cutter qualified at a level analogous to the USN officers previously mentioned. Quartermasters are the navigator's enlisted assistants and perform most of the technical navigation duties. Aboard ships in the Merchant Marine and Merchant Navy, the second mate is generally the (senior) navigator.  In aviation  Navigators are sometimes also called 'air navigators' or 'flight navigators'. In civil aviation this was a position on older aircraft, typically between the late-1910s and the 1970s, where separate crew members (sometimes two navigation crew members) were often responsible for an aircraft's flight navigation, including its dead reckoning and celestial navigation, especially when flown over oceans or other large featureless areas where radio navigation aids were not originally available. As sophisticated electronic air navigation aids and universal space-based GPS navigation systems came online, the dedicated Navigator's position was discontinued and its function was assumed by dual-licensed Pilot- Navigators, and still later by the aircraft's primary pilots (Captain and FO), resulting in a continued downsizing in the number of aircrew positions on commercial flights. Modern electronic navigation systems made the civil aviation navigators redundant by the early 1980s. Navigators cockpit 1928 In military aviation, navigators are still actively trained and licensed in some present day air forces, as electronic navigation aids cannot be assumed to be operational during wartime. In the world's air forces, modern navigators are frequently tasked with weapons and defensive systems operations, along with co-pilot duties such as flight planning and fuel management, depending on the type, model and series of aircraft. In the U.S. Air Force, the aeronautical rating of navigator has been augmented by addition of the combat systems officer, while in the U.S. Navy and U.S. Marine Corps, those officers formerly called navigators, tactical systems officers, or naval aviation observers have been known as naval flight officers since the mid-1960s. USAF navigators/combat systems officers and USN/USMC naval flight officers must be basic mission qualified in their aircraft, or fly with an instructor navigator or instructor NFO to provide the necessary training for their duties.  Nautical charts  NOAA chart of part of Puerto Rico A naval ship's navigator is responsible for buying and maintaining its nautical charts. A nautical chart, or simply \\"chart\\", is a graphic representation of a maritime or flight region and adjacent coastal regions. Depending on the scale of the chart, it may show depths of water and heights of land, natural features of the seabed, details of the coastline, navigational hazards, locations of natural and man-made aids to navigation, information on tides and currents, local details of the Earth's magnetic field, restricted flying areas, and man- made structures such as harbors, buildings and bridges. Nautical charts are essential tools for marine navigation; many countries require vessels, especially commercial ships, to carry them. Nautical charting may take the form of charts printed on paper or computerised electronic navigational charts. The nature of a waterway depicted by a chart changes regularly, and a mariner navigating on an old or uncorrected chart is courting disaster. Every producer of navigational charts also provides a system to inform mariners and aviators of changes that affect the chart. In the United States, chart corrections and notifications of new editions are provided by various governmental agencies by way of Notices to Airmen (NOTAMs), Notice to Mariners, Local Notice to Mariners, Summary of Corrections, and Broadcast Notice to Mariners. Radio broadcasts give advance notice of urgent corrections. A convenient way to keep track of corrections is with a \\"chart and publication correction record card\\" system. Using this system, the navigator does not immediately update every chart in the portfolio when a new Notice to Mariners arrives, instead creating a card for every chart and noting the correction on this card. When the time comes to use the chart, he pulls the chart and chart's card, and makes the indicated corrections on the chart. This system ensures that every chart is properly corrected prior to use. British merchant vessels receive weekly Notices to Mariners issued by the Admiralty. When corrections are received all charts are corrected in the ship's folio and recorded in NP133A (Admiralty Chart Correction Log and Folio Index). This system ensures that all charts are corrected and up to date. In a deep-sea vessel with a folio of over three thousand charts this can be a laborious and time-consuming task for the [navigator]. Various and diverse methods exist for the correction of electronic navigational charts.  Nautical publications  This page from a Sailing Directions assists the navigator by providing pictures and descriptions of a harbor approach. The term nautical publications is used in maritime circles to describe a set of publications, generally published by national governments, for use in safe navigation of ships, boats, and similar vessels. The nature of waterways described by any given nautical publication changes regularly, and a mariner navigating by use of an old or uncorrected publication is courting disaster. Every producer of nautical publications also provides a system to inform mariners of changes that affect the chart. In the United States, corrections and notifications of new editions are provided by various governmental agencies by way of Notice to Mariners, Local Notice to Mariners, Summary of Corrections, and Broadcast Notice to Mariners. Radio broadcasts give advance notice of urgent corrections. For ensuring that all publications are fully up- to-date, similar methods are employed as for nautical charts. Various and diverse methods exist for the correction of electronic nautical publications.  Mission and passage planning  The navigator focuses on creating the ship's passage plans (or \\"mission plans\\" for USAF purposes). A mission or passage plan can be summarized as a comprehensive, step by step description of how the voyage is to proceed from berth to berth, including unberthing, departure, the en-route portion of a voyage, approach, and mooring/arrival at the destination. Before each voyage begins, the navigator should develop a detailed mental model of how the entire voyage will proceed. In the aviation community, this is known as \\"chair flying.\\" This mental model includes charting courses and forecasting weather, tides, and currents. It includes updating and checking aeronautical charts, nautical publications, which could include Sailing Directions and Coast Pilots, and projecting the various future events including landfalls, narrow passages, and course changes that will transpire during the voyage. This mental model becomes the standard by which he will measure progress toward the goal of a safe and efficient voyage, and it is manifested in a written passage plan. When working in a team environment, the passage/mission plan should be communicated to the navigation team in a pre-voyage conference (USAF term is \\"mission briefing\\") in order to ensure that all members of the team share the same mental model of the entire trip. Passage planning procedures are specified in International Maritime Organization Resolutions, in the laws of IMO signatory countries (for example, Title 33 of the U.S. Code of Federal Regulations), and a number of professional books and USN/USAF publications. There are some fifty elements of a comprehensive passage plan depending on the size and type of vessel, each applicable according to the individual situation. electronic systems. A good passage plan will include a track line laid out upon the largest-scale charts available which cover the vessel's track. The navigator will draw and redraw the track line until it is safe, efficient, and in line with all applicable laws and regulations. When the track is finished, it is becoming common practice to also enter it into electronic navigation tools such as an Electronic Chart Display and Information System, a chartplotter, or a GPS unit. Once the voyage has begun the progress of the vessel along its planned route must be monitored. This requires that the ship's position be determined, using standard methods including dead reckoning, radar fixing, celestial navigation, pilotage, and electronic navigation, to include usage of GPS and navigation computer equipment. Passage planning software, tide and tidal current predictors, celestial navigational calculators, consumables estimators for fuel, oil, water, and stores, and other useful applications.  Navigational equipment  The navigator is responsible for the maintenance of the ship's navigational equipment. U.S. Air Force navigators are responsible for troubleshooting problems of the navigation equipment while airborne, but the ground Maintenance personnel are ultimately responsible for the repair and upkeep of that aircraft's navigation system.  In science fiction  Navigators are often part of a starship crew in science fiction, where they are sometimes called astrogators, a merger of the prefix \\"astro\\" and \\"navigator\\". According to a science fiction citations site for the Oxford English Dictionary, the earliest known use of the word is in David Lasser's 1931 book The Conquest of Space. According to that site and also Brave New Words: The Oxford Dictionary of Science Fiction, it first appeared in science fiction in Stanley G. Weinbaum's short story \\"The Planet of Doubt\\", published in the October 1935 issue of Astounding Stories. The title character of Robert A. Heinlein's 1953 novel Starman Jones is an astrogator. The Guild Navigators in the Dune franchise use a limited form of prescience to safely navigate interstellar space.

Opened in May 1939, the Ch√¢teauesque-styled building is considered one of Canada's grand railway hotels. The hotel stands , and contains 17 floors. It was the tallest building in Vancouver until the completion of TD Tower in 1972. Location Hotel Vancouver sits at 900 West Georgia Street, within the Financial District, the central business district of Downtown Vancouver. The hotel property is bounded by Burrard Street to the northwest, West Georgia Street to the northeast, and Hornby Street to the southeast. To the southwest, the hotel property is bounded by two buildings, including 750 Burrard Street. The hotel is located close to several attractions in downtown Vancouver. The hotel is situated directly northwest of the Vancouver Art Gallery, as well as Robson Square, a public square adjacent to the art museum. North of the hotel also lies Christ Church Cathedral, the oldest church in the city. The hotel is also situated near two SkyTrain rapid transit stations, Burrard station, and Vancouver City Centre station. Design =Architecture= The chateauesque-styled Hotel Vancouver features a copper pitched roof with dormers. Hotel Vancouver is one of Canada's grand railway hotels, initially built by Canadian National Railway. The building was designed by Canadian architects, John Smith Archibald, and John Schofield. Although construction for the hotel began in 1929, its completion would not occur until 1939 as a result of funding issues during Great Depression. The completion of the hotel required a joint investment into the property from Canadian Pacific Hotels, a division of Canadian Pacific Railway. The hotel was a part of series of Chateauesque grand railway hotels built throughout Canada in the late-19th and early 20th centuries. Like the other grand railway hotels, Hotel Vancouver incorporates elements from chateaus found in France's Loire Valley. Chateauesque features found on Hotel Vancouver includes its prominent copper pitched roof with dormers, and carved stonework encompassing a steel frame. In addition to chateauesque elements found on most grand railway hotels, Hotel Vancouver also incorporates Renaissance architectural detailings, gargoyles, and relief sculptures. In 1939, a number of artists were commissioned to complete the decorative work for the building, including Olea Marion Davis, Charles Marega, Beatrice Lennie, Valentine Shabief, and Lilias Farley.Davis, Olea Marion [artist file].

In 2018, the hotel announced the completion of its four-year renovation project, which saw a reworked main lobby, and guest rooms. The project also restored the 14th floor of the hotel to its original decor from 1939. Restored items on the 14th floor include English harewood doors with bronze doorplates, bronze hallway doors, sapele-panelled walls with bronze strips at its elevator lobby. In addition to lodgings, the hotel also houses several food-based services, as well as a restaurant, Notch8 Restaurant + Bar. The restaurant also hosts the hotel's afternoon tea service. Other facilities at the hotel include a gym, swimming pool, and spa. History Plans to develop a railway hotel at the present site of Hotel Vancouver first emerged in the 1920s, from Canadian Northern Railway. In 1929 work on the present Hotel Vancouver commenced for Canadian National Railway. Canadian National Railway built the hotel as a result of a land deal between the city, and Canadian Northern Railway, a company later acquired by Canadian National Railway. The land deal required the city to prepare tidal flats on False Creek for the construction of railway yards and Pacific Central Station. In return, the company guaranteed the construction of a large downtown hotel, and make the city the western terminus for its rail network. Shortly after the erection of the building's steel frame however, work on the hotel was halted, as a result of the Great Depression. Work did not resume on the building until 1937, when Canadian National Railway partnered with Canadian Pacific Railway to complete the new hotel. Work on the hotel was rushed to completion in time for King George VI and Queen Elizabeth's 1939 royal tour of Canada. The hotel was the third hotel in the city to use the name \\"Hotel Vancouver\\". The first and second Hotel Vancouver were both located southeast of the present hotel on West Georgia Street. In an effort to prevent competition with the new Hotel Vancouver, Canadian Pacific Railway, closed its hotel operations at the second Hotel Vancouver once the new hotel opened. The second Hotel Vancouver building was torn down in 1949, after Canadian Pacific sold the property to Eaton's in December 1948. During the mid-20th century, the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation radio stations were located within Hotel Vancouver. On 1 May 1940, Dal Richards began his career playing in an 11-piece band and a then-unknown 13-year-old Juliette at the hotel's Panorama Roof Ballroom, an event space at Hotel Vancouver. Richard became a regular performer for The Roof, a CBC Radio show broadcast from the hotel. In 1962, Canadian National Hotels, a division of Canadian National Railway, acquired Canadian Pacific Hotels' share of the property, gaining full ownership of the hotel. From 1963 to 1983, the hotel was managed by Hilton Hotels & Resorts. Canadian National Hotels resumed management of the hotel in 1983, after its management contract with Hilton ended. In 1988 Canadian National Hotels sold its remaining nine properties, including Hotel Vancouver, to Canadian Pacific Hotels. The hotel was renamed the \\"Fairmont Hotel Vancouver\\" in 2001. In 2001, Canadian Pacific Hotels was reorganized as Fairmont Hotels and Resorts, adopting the name from an American company it had purchased in 1999. The hotel's name was changed to the Fairmont Hotel Vancouver as a part of this re-branding effort. In 2007 Fairmont Hotels and Resorts sold 25 hotel properties, including Hotel Vancouver, to Caisse de d√©p√¥t et placement du Qu√©bec, although Fairmont continues to manage the hotel. In 2015, the property was sold to Larco Enterprise for C$180 million. In preparation for the building's 80th anniversary, the hotel underwent a C$12 million renovation of the hotel lobby, restaurant, and guest rooms. The renovations took place from 2014 to 2018.

It is generally opaque, but it is translucent in thin crystals. Its luster and multiple crystal faces produce a desirable gem. Cassiterite was the chief tin ore throughout ancient history and remains the most important source of tin today. Occurrence Cassiterite bipyramids, edge length ca. 30 mm, Sichuan, China Most sources of cassiterite today are found in alluvial or placer deposits containing the resistant weathered grains. The best sources of primary cassiterite are found in the tin mines of Bolivia, where it is found in hydrothermal veins. Rwanda has a nascent cassiterite mining industry. Fighting over cassiterite deposits (particularly in Walikale) is a major cause of the conflict waged in eastern parts of the Democratic Republic of the Congo. This has led to cassiterite being considered a conflict mineral. Cassiterite is a widespread minor constituent of igneous rocks. The Bolivian veins and the old exhausted workings of Cornwall, England, are concentrated in high temperature quartz veins and pegmatites associated with granitic intrusives. The veins commonly contain tourmaline, topaz, fluorite, apatite, wolframite, molybdenite, and arsenopyrite. The mineral occurs extensively in Cornwall as surface deposits on Bodmin Moor, for example, where there are extensive traces of an hydraulic mining method known as streaming. The current major tin production comes from placer or alluvial deposits in Malaysia, Thailand, Indonesia, the Maakhir region of Somalia, and Russia. Hydraulic mining methods are used to concentrate mined ore, a process which relies on the high specific gravity of the SnO2 ore, of about 7.0. Crystallography Crystal structure of cassiterite Crystal twinning is common in cassiterite and most aggregate specimens show crystal twins. The typical twin is bent at a near-60-degree angle, forming an \\"elbow twin\\". Botryoidal or reniform cassiterite is called wood tin.

Yanukovych, who served as president of Ukraine from 2010 to 2014. One of their actions on his behalf was to produce a report justifying Yanukovych's imprisonment of former prime minister Yulia V. Tymoshenko and denying that the action had been a political prosecution, although many Western countries characterized it as such. Later that year a team of American lawyers commissioned by the government of Ukraine concluded that Tymoshenko's trial had not been fair and her rights had been violated. After Yanukovych's downfall, Skadden's work on his behalf led to several federal investigations. One Skadden attorney, Alex van der Zwaan, was convicted of lying to the FBI about his work on Yanukovych's behalf and served 30 days in jail. Tymoshenko made plans to sue Skadden, and in May 2020 it was revealed that Skadden paid at least $11 million to settle the case before a lawsuit could be filed. Skadden, along with Mercury Public Affairs and the Podesta Group, was investigated by the District Attorney for the Southern District of New York (SNDY) for possible lobbying violations regarding former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort.

Holloway Road is a road in London, in length. It is one of the main shopping streets in North London, and carries the A1 road as it passes through Holloway, in the London Borough of Islington. The road starts at the Archway, near Archway Underground station, then heads south-east, past Upper Holloway railway station, Whittington Park, past the North London campus of London Metropolitan University near Nag's Head, past Holloway Road Underground station, and the main campus of the university, and then becomes Highbury Corner, near Highbury & Islington station. Name The origins of the name are disputed; some believe that it derives from \\"hollow\\" due to the dip in the road from the cattle that made their way along the route to the cattle markets in London, whilst some believe it derives from \\"hallow\\" and refers to the road's historic significance as part of the pilgrimage route to Walsingham. No documentary evidence can be found to support either derivation. History The earliest record giving the name of the road as The Holloway dates from 1307. The main stretch of Holloway Road runs through the site of the villages of Tollington and Stroud. The exact time of their founding is not known, but the earliest record of them dates from 1000. The names ceased to be used by the late 17th century, but are still preserved in the local place names \\"Tollington Park\\" and \\"Stroud Green\\"; since that time, the area has been known as Holloway. Description The Orion Building Holloway Road is one of north London's shopping streets, containing major stores as well as numerous smaller shops. Holloway Road is the site of the main campus of the much-renamed London Metropolitan University (formerly Northern Polytechnic Institute, the Polytechnic of North London and University of North London), and includes the Orion Building, designed by Daniel Libeskind, which can be seen along the central stretch of Holloway Road, and of the headquarters of the National Union of Students and the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament. Most of the shops are clustered in the Nag's Head area, near the junction with Seven Sisters Road. North of the Seven Sisters Road is the Nambucca pub and music venue, which burned down in 2008 and reopened two years later. Archway The complex junction at the Archway interchange The northern point of Holloway Road is the complex interchange at Archway, where the A1 leaves the historic route of the Great North Road. The traditional Great North Road heads northwest up Highgate Hill (now the B519) before turning north at North Road, Highgate to cross the current A1 route. The A1 heads north along the relatively recently built Archway Road. The construction of the interchange left a few buildings isolated in the centre of the roundabout, including the Archway Tavern, which appears on the cover of The Kinks' 1971 album Muswell Hillbillies. Churches St John's Church, designed by Charles Barry, Jr. Holloway Road contains two significant London churches. St Mary Magdalene is situated in St Mary Magdalene Gardens near the southern end of the road. Built by William Wickings in 1814, it is one of the best preserved early 19th century churches in London. Charles Barry, Jr.'s St John's Church is a leading example of Gothic architecture and dominates the northern end of the road. Railway stations As one of London's primary transport routes during the 19th century railway boom, Holloway Road contains a number of railway stations. Highbury Corner is the site of Highbury & Islington station, one of London's most important transport interchanges. The Victoria line, Northern City Line, and the London Overground North London Line converge at this location. It is also the northern terminus of the London Overground East London Line. The station building was badly damaged by a V-1 flying bomb in 1944 and never rebuilt. The remainder of the building was demolished in 1966 in preparation for the construction of the Victoria line; the only surface building is a small entrance hall, set back from the main road. Holloway Road tube station Holloway Road station opened with the Piccadilly line in 1906, next door to an existing Great Northern Railway main line station built in 1852. The main line station closed in 1915. Although Holloway Road is the nearest station to the Emirates Stadium, trains do not stop here on match days due to concerns about overcrowding. Upper Holloway station was built in 1868 as part of the Tottenham & Hampstead Junction Railway. It is served by trains on the Gospel Oak to Barking Line, which now forms part of the London Overground network. Archway station is not actually situated on Holloway Road, but approximately 10 m off the main road on Junction Road, underneath the architecturally striking Archway Tower. Originally known as \\"Highgate\\", it was the original northern terminus of the Charing Cross, Euston & Hampstead Railway and until 1940 was the northern terminus of the Northern line. In popular culture 726‚Äì732 Holloway Road ‚Äì the location of the fictional Brickfield Terrace in Diary of a Nobody Record producer Joe Meek, responsible amongst other things for Telstar by The Tornados, a massive UK and US no. 1 record in 1962, and the highly influential 1959 album I Hear a New World, lived, worked, and committed suicide at 304 Holloway Road, where he is commemorated by a plaque. Sex Pistols singer John Lydon (Johnny Rotten) claims to have been born and raised in side-street Benwell Road, although no documentary evidence survives of this. The road also features heavily as the home of a fictionalised Meek in Jake Arnott's The Long Firm trilogy, and was the setting for George and Weedon Grossmith's Diary of a Nobody. A row of Victorian houses, numbers 726‚Äì732, opposite Upper Holloway station, stands at the described location of the fictional Brickfield Terrace in Diary of a Nobody. The architecture is typical for buildings on this stretch of the road. Former pirate radio station Kiss FM would base their studios and offices at 80 Holloway Road when they first launched as a legal radio station.

Anne Commire, Detroit: Gale Research, 1976, pp. 195‚Äì96. Her first book was an imitation of Florence Kate Upton's Golliwog stories and was titled Golliwog at the Zoo. It \\"consisted of verses illustrated with watercolors of the two Dutch clocks and the Golliwag.\\" Warner presented this book to her grandfather, and every Christmas afterwards, she would give him a hand-made book as a present. While growing up, Warner loved to read, and her favorite book was Alice's Adventures in Wonderland. Being in a musical family, she was predisposed to play an instrument; in her case, she chose the cello, and her father bought her a cello kit at a young age. However, because of her frequent illnesses, Warner never finished high school. After leaving in her sophomore year, she learned from a tutor and finished her secondary education. In 1918, while she was teaching Sunday School, Warner was called to teach first grade, mainly because male teachers were being called to serve in World War I. Warner continued teaching as a grade school teacher in Putnam, CT from 1918‚Äì1950. Also during this time, she returned to school for education courses at Yale University summer school. Warner was a lover of nature. While growing up, she had butterfly and moth collections, pressed wildflowers, learned of all the birds in her area, and kept a garden. She used these interests in teaching her grade school students, and also used nature themes in her books. For instance, in the second book of The Boxcar Children (Surprise Island), the Alden children make a nature museum from the flowers, shells and seaweed they have collected and the shapes of birds they have observed. One of her students recalled the wildflower and stone-gathering contests that Warner sponsored when she was a teacher. As well as her books in The Boxcar Children series, Warner wrote many other books for children, including The World in a Barn (1927), Windows into Alaska (1928), The World on a Farm (1931) and Peter Piper, Missionary Parakeet (1967).

It included 4 color illustrations by Dorothy Lake Gregory. In 1942, Warner rewrote the book with a prescribed vocabulary of six hundred words and a text of about 15,000 words, so that it could be used as a children's school reader. This edition featured numerous black-and-white silhouette illustrations by L. Kate Deal. Warner continued writing other things, but did not continue with The Boxcar Children series until her retirement from teaching. The second book in the series, Surprise Island, was published in 1949. Warner once acknowledged that The Boxcar Children was criticized for depicting children with little parental supervision; her critics thought that this would encourage child rebellion. Her response was, however, that the children liked it for that very reason.\\"The Boxcar Children: A Museum Caper\\", Gail Braccidiferro, The New York Times, June 20, 2004.

Sharpe, 347 U.S. 497 (1954), is a landmark United States Supreme Court case in which the Court held that the Constitution prohibits segregated public schools in the District of Columbia. Originally argued on December 10‚Äì11, 1952, a year before Brown v. Board of Education, Bolling was reargued on December 8‚Äì9, 1953, and was unanimously decided on May 17, 1954, the same day as Brown. The Bolling decision was supplemented in 1955 with the second Brown opinion, which ordered desegregation \\"with all deliberate speed\\". In Bolling, the Court did not address school desegregation in the context of the Fourteenth Amendment's Equal Protection Clause, which applies only to the states, but rather held that school segregation was unconstitutional under the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution. The Court observed that the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution lacked an Equal Protection Clause, as in the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. The Court held, however, that the concepts of Equal Protection and Due Process are not mutually exclusive, establishing the reverse incorporation doctrine. Background Beginning in late 1941, a group of parents from the Anacostia neighborhood of Washington, D.C., calling themselves the Consolidated Parents Group, petitioned the Board of Education of the District of Columbia to open the nearly-completed John Phillip Sousa Junior High as an integrated school. The school board denied the petition and the school opened, admitting only whites. On September 11, 1950, Gardner Bishop, Nicholas Stabile and the Consolidated Parents Group attempted to get eleven African-American students (including the case's plaintiff, Spottswood Bolling) admitted to the school, but were refused entry by the school's principal. James Nabrit Jr., a professor of law at Howard University School of Law, a historically black university, filed suit in 1951 on behalf of Bolling and the other students in the District Court for the District of Columbia seeking assistance in the students' admission. After the court dismissed the claim, the case was granted a writ of certiorari by the Supreme Court in 1952. Howard law professor George E. C. Hayes worked with Nabrit on the oral argument for the Supreme Court hearing. While Nabrit's argument in Bolling rested on the unconstitutionality of segregation, the much more famous Brown v. Board of Education (decided on the same day) argued that the idea of 'separate but equal' facilities sanctioned by Plessy v. Ferguson, 163 U.S. 537 (1896) was a fallacy as the facilities for black students were woefully inadequate. Decision The Court, led by newly confirmed Chief Justice Earl Warren, decided unanimously in favor of the plaintiffs. In his opinion, Justice Warren noted that while the 14th Amendment, whose Equal Protection Clause was cited in Brown in order to declare segregation unconstitutional, does not apply in the District of Columbia, the Fifth Amendment did apply. While the Fifth Amendment lacks an equal protection clause, Warren held that \\"the concepts of equal protection and due process, both stemming from our American ideal of fairness, are not mutually exclusive.\\" While equal protection is a more explicit safeguard against discrimination, the Court stated that \\"discrimination may be so unjustifiable as to be violative of due process.\\" Referring to the technicalities raised by the case's location in the District of Columbia, the Court held that, in light of their decision in Brown that segregation in state public schools is prohibited by the Constitution, it would be \\"unthinkable that the same Constitution would impose a lesser duty on the Federal Government\\". The Court concluded: \\"racial segregation in the public schools of the District of Columbia is a denial of the due process of law guaranteed by the 5th Amendment\\". The Court restored both Bolling and Brown to the docket until they could reconvene to discuss how to effectively implement the decisions. Controversy Some scholars have argued that the Court's decision in Bolling should have been reached on other grounds. For example, Judge Michael W. McConnell of the United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit wrote that Congress never \\"required that the schools of the District of Columbia be segregated\\". According to that rationale, the segregation of schools in Washington D.C. was unauthorized and therefore illegal. In a debate, law professors Cass Sunstein and Randy Barnett agreed that while the result was desirable, Bolling does not reconcile with the Constitution, with Barnett saying: \\"You are right to point out that the Supreme Court's decision in Bolling v. Sharpe is very difficult to reconcile with the text of the Constitution. For this reason, you know that among constitutional scholars of all stripes Bolling is one of the most controversial and difficult cases ever decided by the Court.\\" See also *List of United States Supreme Court cases, volume 347 References Further reading * External links Category:African-American history of Washington, D.C.

It is about a witch who marries an ordinary mortal man and vows to lead the life of a typical suburban housewife. The show was popular, finishing as the second-rated show in America during its debut season, staying in the top ten for its first three seasons, and ranking in eleventh place for both seasons four and five. The show continues to be seen throughout the world in syndication and on recorded media. Bewitched was created by Sol Saks under executive director Harry Ackerman and starred: Elizabeth Montgomery as Samantha Stephens; Dick York (1964‚Äì1969) as Darrin Stephens, her husband. Dick Sargent replaced an ailing York for the final three seasons (1969‚Äì1972); Agnes Moorehead as Endora, Samantha's mother; David White as Larry Tate, Darrin's boss; Irene Vernon (1964‚Äì1966) and later Kasey Rogers (1966‚Äì1972) as Louise Tate, Larry's wife; Alice Pearce (1964‚Äì1966) as Gladys Kravitz; George Tobias (1964‚Äì1971) as her husband Abner Kravitz; and Erin Murphy (1966‚Äì1972) as Tabitha Stephens. In 1966, Sandra Gould took over the part of Gladys Kravitz (1966‚Äì1971) when Alice Pearce died. Annual semi-regulars included Maurice Evans as Maurice, Samantha's father; Marion Lorne as Samantha's Aunt Clara (1964‚Äì1968); Alice Ghostley as Esmeralda, Samantha's babysitter (1969‚Äì1972); Paul Lynde as Samantha's Uncle Arthur (1965‚Äì1971); Mabel Albertson as Darrin's mother Phyllis Stephens (1964‚Äì1971); and Robert F. Simon and Roy Roberts alternating the role of Frank Stephens, Darrin's father (1964‚Äì1971). In 2002, Bewitched was ranked #50 on \\"TV Guide's 50 Greatest TV Shows of All Time\\". In 1997, the same magazine ranked the season 2 episode \\"Divided He Falls\\" #48 on their list of the \\"100 Greatest Episodes of All Time\\". Plot Dick York and Elizabeth Montgomery (1968) A beautiful witch named Samantha (Elizabeth Montgomery) meets and marries a mortal named Darrin Stephens (originally Dick York, later Dick Sargent). While Samantha complies with Darrin's wishes to become a normal suburban housewife, her magical family disapproves of the mixed marriage and frequently interferes in the couple's lives. Episodes often begin with Darrin becoming the victim of a spell, the effects of which wreak havoc with mortals such as his boss, clients, parents, and neighbors. By the epilogue, however, Darrin and Samantha most often embrace, having overcome the devious elements that failed to separate them. The witches and their male counterparts, warlocks, are very long-lived; while Samantha appears to be a young woman, many episodes suggest she is actually hundreds of years old. To keep their society secret, witches avoid showing their powers in front of mortals other than Darrin. Nevertheless, the effects of their spells‚Äîand Samantha's attempts to hide their supernatural origin from mortals‚Äîdrive the plot of most episodes. Witches and warlocks usually use physical gestures along with their incantations. To perform magic, Samantha often twitches her nose to create a spell. Special visual effects are accompanied by music to highlight such an action. Setting The main setting for most episodes is the Stephens' house at 1164 Morning Glory Circle, in an upper-middle-class suburban neighborhood, either in Westport, Connecticut or Patterson, New York as indicated by conflicting information presented throughout the series. Many scenes also take place at the fictional Madison Avenue advertising agency McMann and Tate, where Darrin works Characters Dick York, Elizabeth Montgomery (front) and Agnes Moorehead (back) as Darrin, Samantha and Endora Clockwise: Dick Sargent, Elizabeth Montgomery, Erin Murphy and David Lawrence during the show's final season (1971‚Äì1972) * Elizabeth Montgomery as Samantha Stephens * Dick York (seasons 1‚Äì5), Dick Sargent (season 6‚Äì8) as Darrin Stephens * Agnes Moorehead as Endora * David White (recurring in seasons 1‚Äì5, starring in seasons 6‚Äì8) as Larry Tate During its run, the series had a number of major cast changes, often because of illness or death of the actors. In particular, York was replaced after the fifth season, during which he had missed several episodes. Precursors Creator Sol Saks' inspirations for this series were the film I Married a Witch (1942), developed from Thorne Smith's unfinished novel The Passionate Witch, and the John Van Druten Broadway play Bell, Book and Candle, which was adapted into the 1958 film Bell, Book and Candle.Metz (2007), p. 18-25 In I Married a Witch, Wallace Wooley (Fredric March) is a descendant of people who executed witches at the Salem witch trials. As revenge, a witch (Veronica Lake) prepares a love potion for him. She ends up consuming her own potion and falling for her enemy. Her father is against this union. In the film of Bell, Book and Candle, modern witch Gillian Holroyd (Kim Novak) uses a love spell on Shep Henderson (James Stewart) to have a simple fling with him but genuinely falls for the man. Both films were properties of Columbia Pictures, which also owned Screen Gems, the company that produced Bewitched. Production and broadcasting Elizabeth Montgomery and Paul Lynde as Uncle Arthur (1968) Sol Saks received credit as the creator of the show; he wrote the pilot of Bewitched but was not involved with the show after the pilot. Creator Saks, executive producer Harry Ackerman, and director William Asher started rehearsals for the pilot on November 22, 1963; this coincided with the assassination of John F. Kennedy. Asher felt personally affected by the event, as he knew Kennedy; he had produced the 1962 televised birthday party where Marilyn Monroe sang \\"Happy Birthday, Mr. President\\".Metz (2007), p. 14-17 The pilot concerned \\"the occult destabilization of the conformist life of an upwardly mobile advertising man\\". For that first episode, \\"I Darrin, Take This Witch, Samantha\\", Academy Award- winning actor Jos√© Ferrer served as the narrator. First season producer and head writer Danny Arnold set the initial style and tone of the series, and he also helped develop supporting characters such as Larry Tate and the Kravitzes. Arnold, who wrote on McHale's Navy and other shows, thought of Bewitched essentially as a romantic comedy about a mixed marriage; his episodes kept the magic element to a minimum. One or two magical acts drove the plot, but Samantha often solved problems without magic. Many of the first season's episodes were allegorical, using supernatural situations as metaphors for the problems any young couple would face. Arnold stated that the two main themes of the series were the conflict between a powerful woman and a husband who cannot deal with that power, and the anger of a bride's mother at seeing her daughter marry beneath her. Though the show was a hit right from the beginning, finishing its first year as the number 2 show in the United States, ABC wanted more magic and more farcical plots, causing battles between Arnold and the network. In its first season, Bewitched was American Broadcasting Company's number one show and the best rated sitcom among all three networks, coming second in ratings only to Bonanza. Bewitched aired at 9 pm Thursday evenings. It was preceded on the air by another sitcom, My Three Sons, and followed by the soap opera Peyton Place. My Three Sons finished 13th in the ratings and Peyton Place ninth. The block formed by the three shows was the strongest ratings grabber in ABC's schedule. Arnold left the show after the first season, leaving producing duties to his friend Jerry Davis, who had already produced some of the first season's episodes (though Arnold was still supervising the writing). The second season was produced by Davis, and, with Bernard Slade as head writer, misunderstandings and farce became more prevalent elements, though this season still included a number of more low-key episodes in which the magical element was not strongly emphasized. With the third season and the switch to color, Davis left the show, and was replaced as producer by William Froug. Slade also left after the second season. According to William Froug's autobiography, William Asher (who had directed many episodes) wanted to take over as producer when Jerry Davis left, but the production company was not yet ready to approve the idea. Froug, a former producer of Gilligan's Island and the last season of The Twilight Zone, was brought in as a compromise. By his own admission, Froug was not very familiar with Bewitched and found himself in the uncomfortable position of being the official producer even though Asher was making most of the creative decisions. After a year, Froug left the show, and Asher took over as full-time producer of the series for the rest of its run. The first two seasons had aired Thursdays at 9:00, and the time was moved to 8:30 shortly after the third year (1966‚Äì1967) had begun. Nevertheless, the ratings for Bewitched remained high and it placed among the top fifteen shows through the 1968‚Äì69 season. It was the seventh highest-rated show in both the U.S. '65‚Äì'66 and '66‚Äì'67 schedules. Similarly, it was number 11 the following two years. Marion Lorne as Samantha's bumbling Aunt Clara At the time, the show had won three Emmy Awards. William Asher won the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Directing for a Comedy Series in 1966. Alice Pearce posthumously won the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Comedy Series for her portrayal of Gladys Kravitz and Marion Lorne won the same award posthumously in 1968 for her portrayal of Aunt Clara. Producers were faced with how to deal with the deaths of both these actresses. When Pearce became too ill to work in early 1966, Mary Grace Canfield was hired to play Gladys's sister-in-law Harriet Kravitz in four episodes. Comedienne Alice Ghostley was approached to take over the role of Gladys the next season, but turned it down. She and Pearce were good friends so Ghostley decided to decline the role out of respect for Pearce. In the fall of 1966, Sandra Gould was hired as Gladys Kravitz. Gould would remain with the show until the spring of 1971. After Marion Lorne's death in the spring of 1968, she was not replaced, and the character of Aunt Clara was not seen after the fourth season. Beginning in the show's sixth year, Alice Ghostley was finally used to play the character of Esmeralda, a kind but shy and inept witch who served as a nanny and nursemaid to Darrin and Samantha's children, Tabitha and Adam. (Ironically, Ghostley had appeared in a similar role as Naomi, an incompetent domestic hired by Darrin to do housecleaning for a pregnant Samantha in the second season episode \\"Maid To Order\\".) In another notable casting change, Louise Tate, played by Irene Vernon during the first two seasons, was played by Kasey Rogers thereafter. The fifth season of Bewitched (1968-1969) proved to be a turning point for the series, most notably with the mid-season departure of Dick York and the record eight episodes which were filmed without him afterwards (although aired out of order with previously filmed episodes). York was suffering from recurring back problems, the result of an accident during the filming of They Came To Cordura (1959). As a result, many episodes in seasons three and four had York's character of Darrin out of town on business. Towards the end of the season five, York's increased disability, which had caused numerous shooting delays and script rewrites, resulted in his collapsing on the set in January 1969 while filming the episode \\"Daddy Does His Thing\\". He was immediately rushed to the hospital and after a long talk with producer-director William Asher, York decided to leave the series. At about the same time, Montgomery and Asher announced that they were expecting another baby and it was decided that Samantha and Darrin would also have another child in the fall of that year. On screen, Samantha tells Darrin over the phone the news of her second pregnancy in the fifth season episode \\"Samantha's Good News\\". That same month, Dick Sargent was cast to play Darrin beginning in the sixth season.\\"Sargent Replaces Bewitched Costar\\". Los Angeles Times. January 31, 1969. p. G14. It was also during this season also that Serena (Samantha's identical cousin, also played by Montgomery) was used more frequently. Filming of scenes involving both Samantha and Serena was accomplished by using Melody McCord, Montgomery's stand-in. Maurice Evans as Samantha's father, with Elizabeth Montgomery (1971) Beginning with the sixth season's (1969‚Äì1970) opening credits, in addition to York being replaced with Sargent, Elizabeth Montgomery was billed above the title, and David White now received billing as well, after Agnes Moorehead's. During this year, the show saw a significant decline in ratings, falling from eleventh to 24th place. In mid-1970, the set of the Stephens' home was being rebuilt due to a fire. In June, the cast and crew traveled to Salem, Magnolia, and Gloucester, Massachusetts to film an eight- part story arc in which Samantha, Darrin, and Endora travel to Salem for the centennial Witches Convocation. These location shoots marked the only times the show would film away from its Hollywood studio sets and backlot. Season seven premiered with eight so-called 'Salem Saga' episodes. On June 15, 2005, TV Land unveiled a Samantha statue in Salem to mark the show's 40th anniversary. On hand were three surviving actors from the show, Bernard Fox (Dr. Bombay), Erin Murphy (Tabitha), and Kasey Rogers (Louise Tate), as well as producer/director William Asher. These on-location episodes helped the show's sagging ratings, but after the Salem episodes, viewership again dwindled. Scripts from old episodes were recycled frequently, which may have also contributed to falling ratings. The year's ratings for Bewitched had fallen and the show did not even rank in the list of the top thirty programs. ABC moved Bewitched's airtime from Thursdays at 8:30 pm to Wednesdays at 8:00 pm at the beginning of the eighth season. The schedule change did not help ratings as the show was now pitted against CBS's popular The Carol Burnett Show. Fewer recurring characters were used this season; the Kravitzes, Darrin's parents and Uncle Arthur did not appear at all, and Louise Tate only featured in three episodes. Filming ended in December 1971, and in January 1972 the show was finally moved to Saturday night at 8:00 pm, opposite television's number one show, All in the Family, where it fared even worse, with Bewitched finishing in 72nd place for the year. During its first five seasons, Bewitched was sponsored by both General Motors‚Äô Chevrolet division and the Quaker Oats Company. As a result, Chevrolet vehicles were often prominently featured on the series, even as a part of the storyline (an example of product placement), and there were many scenes of the Stephens‚Äô having breakfast in the kitchen. Sponsors in later seasons included Bristol- Myers, Eastman Kodak and Oscar Mayer. =Sets and locations= The 1959 Columbia Pictures film Gidget was filmed on location at a real house in Santa Monica (at 267 18th Street). The blueprint design of this house was later reversed and replicated as a house facade attached to an existing garage on the backlot of Columbia's Ranch. This was the house seen on Bewitched. The patio and living room sets seen in Columbia's Gidget Goes to Rome (1963) were soon adapted for the permanent Bewitched set for 1964. The interior of the Stephens' house can be seen, substantially unaltered, in the Jerry Lewis film Hook, Line & Sinker (1969). The set was also used several times in the television series Gidget and I Dream of Jeannie, as well as the television film Brian's Song (1971). It was also used, as a setting for an opening tag sequence, for the final episode of the first season of another Screen Gems property, The Monkees and in an episode of The Fantastic Journey. The house served as Doctor Bellows' house on I Dream of Jeannie, and was seen in an episode of Home Improvement when Tim Taylor took Tool Time on location to the house of Vinnie's mother to repair a gas leak in the basement furnace (with a second gas leak at the kitchen stove, unbeknownst to Tim). The Stephens house was also featured in a Fruit of the Loom Christmas commercial and it was used as Clark Griswold's boyhood home in his old home movies in National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation. On the Columbia studio backlot, the Kravitzes' house was actually down the street from the Stephenses' house exterior. Both houses' exterior doors opened to an unfinished entry, as the interiors were shot on studio sound stages elsewhere. A \\"front porch\\" set, replicating the porch of the backlot house was created as well. From 1964 through 1966, the Kravitzes' house was the same as used for The Donna Reed Show. Beginning with season 3 color episodes in 1966, the Kravitz house sets were the same as what would (years later) be featured as The Partridge Family house. Production and filming for Bewitched was based in Los Angeles and, although the setting is assumed to be New York, several episodes feature wide-angle exterior views of the Stephenses' neighborhood showing a California landscape with mountains in the distance. Another example of questionable continuity regarding the location can be seen in Season 6, Episode 6: Darrin's parents drive home after visiting the new baby, passing several large palm trees lining the street. Cancellation and aftermath  Despite the low ratings, Bewitched still had a contract for two more seasons on ABC. The network was willing to honor that contract by renewing the sitcom for a ninth season. However, by this time, Montgomery had grown tired of the series and wanted to move on to other roles. Also, she and her husband William Asher had separated and would divorce in 1974. As a consolation, Asher pitched an idea to ABC for a sitcom starring Paul Lynde. The concept was based on the play Howie, about a lawyer (played by Lynde) whose daughter marries a slacker named Howard, or \\"Howie\\". The Lynde character despises him, as he is not interested in earning money or traditional pursuits. Howie was developed for CBS in 1962, as a replacement for The Dick Van Dyke Show, but when that series was saved from cancellation, plans for Howie were discarded. In creating a series for Paul Lynde, Asher decided to resurrect the Howie concept for ABC and Screen Gems as a replacement for Bewitched the following year. Asher designed The Paul Lynde Show to be ABC's counterpart to CBS's All In the Family; however, the show lacked the controversial and topical issues brought up by that series, due to ABC's restriction on social realism. This was despite Lynde's rewrite of the show's dialog in an effort to make the series more lively and comedic. The show bore quite a few similarities to Bewitched. The backyard set of the Simms's house (with the exception of the swimming pool) also had been used as the backyard of Samantha and Darrin Stephens's home. The name of Paul's law firm McNish & Simms was very similar to the name of Darrin Stephens's advertising agency McMann & Tate. In addition, many actors regularly seen on Bewitched were also used on Lynde's series including Mabel Albertson, Herb Voland, Jack Collins, Richard X. Slattery, and Dick Wilson. When The Paul Lynde Show debuted on ABC in the fall of 1972, it inherited Bewitched‚Äôs time slot during its last season on Wednesday nights opposite the first half of the Top 30 hit The Carol Burnett Show on CBS and the Top 20 hit Adam-12 on NBC. It preceded another new ABC program that was also highly touted that year - The Julie Andrews Hour, which was on Wednesday nights at 10:00 P.M on ABC. Coincidentally, Andrews's show featured an old friend of Lynde's from Bewitched as a semi-regular - Alice Ghostley. Despite favorable reviews from critics, both shows suffered from low ratings. Andrews's show struggled against the CBS series Cannon and was moved mid-season to Saturday nights opposite CBS's The Mary Tyler Moore Show at 9:00 P.M. and The Bob Newhart Show at 9:30 P.M. where it fared even worse. Lynde's show remained in its Wednesday night 8:00 P.M. time slot. Surprisingly, at the start of the 1972-1973 fall season, the ratings for Lynde's formidable competition The Carol Burnett Show had slipped and in mid-season, Burnett's series was moved from Wednesday nights at 8:00 P.M. to Saturday nights at 10:00 P.M. where it flourished for the next five years. At the end of the 1972-1973 season, while The Julie Andrews Hour won seven Emmy Awards and Lynde did receive a Golden Globe award nomination for Best Actor in a Comedy Series for The Paul Lynde Show, the ratings for both programs did not improve. As a result, both Lynde's sitcom and Andrews's variety series were canceled after one season. To help fulfill the network‚Äôs contract with Bewitched, Asher and Harry Ackerman created another ABC sitcom for the 1972‚Äì1973 season entitled Temperatures Rising starring James Whitmore and Cleavon Little, which, in its first year, was not only struggling with its format but with the ratings. In mid-season, Asher was replaced as producer by Bruce Johnson and Duke Vincent. Despite its challenges, the series ended its first year with a respectable 29 share and was renewed for the 1973‚Äì1974 season. To improve ratings, ABC wanted to make some changes. When The New Temperatures Rising Show debuted in September 1973, Whitmore was replaced by Paul Lynde and the emphasis on black comedy in the show became more prominent. As a result, the ratings for the series fell well below the levels of the previous season. The last of the thirteen episodes aired on January 8, 1974. The following Tuesday, January 15, ABC premiered Happy Days in its place. When Screen Gems head John Mitchell and ABC chief programmer Barry Diller noticed that The New Temperatures Rising Show was failing, they contacted William Asher and asked him to come back and salvage the series. As a result, the show was resurrected on July 18, 1974 after a six-month hiatus with its original title Temperatures Rising. Joining Lynde and Little in the cast was Bewitched alum Alice Ghostley. Despite the changes in cast and format, the attempt to resuscitate the series failed and ABC finally cancelled it permanently. The final episode of Temperatures Rising aired on August 29, 1974, which ended William Asher‚Äôs original contract with Bewitched and ABC. Cultural context In February 1964, feminist Betty Friedan wrote the two-part essay \\"Television and the Feminine Mystique\\" for TV Guide, wherein she criticized the way women were portrayed in television. She summarized their depiction as stupid, unattractive, and insecure household drudges. Their time was divided between dreaming of love and plotting revenge on their husbands. Samantha was not depicted this way and Endora used Friedan- like words to criticize the boring drudgery of household life. Others have looked at the way that the series 'play[ed] into and subvert[ed] a rich load of cultural stereotypes and allusions' regarding witches, gender roles, advertising and consumerism. In the episode \\"Eat at Mario's\\" (May 27, 1965), Samantha and Endora co-operate in using their witchcraft to defend and promote a quality Italian restaurant. They take delight in an active, aggressive role in the public space, breaking new ground in the depiction of women in television. Airing during the civil rights era, Bewitched none too subtly took on then taboos about interracial marriage. In a 1992 interview, Elizabeth Montgomery was asked if the show was an allegory about closeted homosexuality. She answered, \\"Don't think that didn't enter our minds at the time. We talked about it on the set‚Äîcertainly not in production meetings‚Äîthat this was about people not being allowed to be what they really are. If you think about it, Bewitched is about repression in general and all the frustration and trouble it can cause.\\" Reception Walter Metz attributes the success of the series to its snappy writing, the charm of Elizabeth Montgomery, and the talents of its large supporting cast. The show also made use of respected film techniques for its special effects. The soundtrack was unique, notably where it concerned the synthesized sound of nose twitching. The first episodes featured a voice- over narrator \\"performing comic sociological analyses\\" of the role of a witch in middle class suburbia. The style was reminiscent of Hollywood films such as Will Success Spoil Rock Hunter? (1957). In a 1991 audio interview with film historian Ronald Haver, Elizabeth Montgomery revealed that her father Robert Montgomery was originally approached to narrate these episodes but he refused. Instead, the narration was done by Academy Award-winning actor Jos√© Ferrer, who did not receive credit. The series inspired rival show I Dream of Jeannie (1965‚Äì1970) on NBC, which was produced by the same studio as Bewitched (Screen Gems). Spin-offs, crossovers, and remakes =The Flintstones= The 1965 episode of The Flintstones titled \\"Samantha\\" (1965) featured Dick York and Elizabeth Montgomery as Darrin and Samantha Stephens, who have just moved into the neighborhood. This crossover was facilitated by both series being broadcast on ABC. =Tabitha and Adam and the Clown Family= An animated TV special made in 1972 by Hanna-Barbera Productions for The ABC Saturday Superstar Movie, this featured teenage versions of Tabitha and Adam visiting their aunt and her family who travel with a circus. The show aired on December 2, 1972. =Tabitha= In 1977, a short-lived spin-off entitled Tabitha aired on ABC. Lisa Hartman played Tabitha, now an adult working with her brother Adam at television station KXLA. There were several continuity differences with the original series. Adam and Tabitha had both aged far more than the intervening five years between the two series would have allowed. Adam also had become Tabitha's older mortal brother, rather than her younger warlock brother, as he was in Bewitched. Supporting character Aunt Minerva (Karen Morrow) says she has been close to Tabitha since childhood, though she had never been mentioned once in the original series. Tabitha's parents are mentioned but never appear. However Bernard Fox, Sandra Gould, George Tobias and Dick Wilson reprised their roles as Dr. Bombay, Gladys Kravitz, Abner Kravitz, and \\"various drunks.\\" =Theatrical movie= Bewitched inspired a 2005 film starring Nicole Kidman and Will Ferrell. The film, departing from the show's family-oriented tone, is not a remake but takes a metafictional approach, with the action focused on arrogant, failing Hollywood actor Jack Wyatt (Ferrell) who is offered a career comeback playing Darrin in a remake of Bewitched. The role is contingent upon him finding the perfect woman to play Samantha. He chooses an unknown named Isabel Bigelow (Kidman), who is an actual witch. The film was written, directed, and produced by Nora Ephron, and was poorly received by most critics and was a financial disappointment. It earned $22 million less than the production cost domestically. However it earned an additional $68 million internationally. The New York Times called the film \\"an unmitigated disaster.\\" =Comic adaptations= Dell Comics adapted the series into a comic book series in 1964. The art work was provided by Henry Scarpelli. In 1966, the series was adapted as a strip in Lady Penelope, beginning from issue 12 and lasting until the comic's demise in 1969.\\"Comic Anderson\\": Part 2\\" ‚Äì FAB Issue 63, Stephen Baxter, p.40 =Television remakes= * Argentina: A remake called Hechizada, produced by Telef√©, aired in early 2007. It starred Florencia Pe√±a as Samantha, Gustavo Garz√≥n as her husband, Eduardo, and Georgina Barbarrosa as Endora. This show adapted original scripts to an Argentinian context, with local humor and a contemporary setting. The show was cancelled due to low ratings after a few weeks. * Japan: TBS, a flagship station of Japan News Network, produced a remake called Okusama wa majo (Â••„Åï„Åæ„ÅØÈ≠îÂ•≥, meaning \\"(My) Wife is a Witch\\"), also known as Bewitched in Tokyo. Eleven episodes were broadcast on JNN stations Fridays at 10 pm, from January 16 to March 26, 2004, and a special on December 21, 2004. The main character, Arisa Matsui, was portrayed by Ry≈çko Yonekura. Okusama wa majo is also the Japanese title for the original American series. * India: In 2002, Sony Entertainment Television began airing Meri Biwi Wonderful a local adaptation of Bewitched. * Russia: In 2009, TV3 broadcast a remake entitled \\"–ú–æ—è –ª—é–±–∏–º–∞—è –≤–µ–¥—å–º–∞\\" (\\"My Favorite Witch\\"), starring Anna Zdor as Nadia (Samantha), Ivan Grishanov, as Ivan (Darrin) and Marina Esepenko as Nadia's mother. The series is very similar to the original, with most episodes based on those from the original series. American comedy writer/producer Norm Gunzenhauser oversaw the writing and directing of the series. * United Kingdom: In 2008, the BBC made a pilot episode of a British version, with Sheridan Smith as Samantha, Tom Price as Darrin, and veteran actress Frances de la Tour as Endora. =Proposed reboots= In August 2011 it was reported that CBS ordered a script to be written by Marc Lawrence for a rebooted series of Bewitched. On October 22, 2014, Sony Pictures Television announced that it sold a pilot of Bewitched to NBC as a possible entry for the 2015‚Äî2016 US television season. This show would have concerned Tabitha's daughter Daphne, a single woman who despite having the same magical powers as her mother, grandmother, and great-grandmother, is determined not to use her special abilities to find a soul mate. The new version of the proposed series, written by Abby Kohn and Marc Silverstein, had been on the radar of several major networks, including ABC, after Sony began shopping the project to interested parties. On August 23, 2018, ABC announced that it had bought a pilot for a single camera Bewitched remake from Black-ish creator Kenya Barris. This is Barris's last new project for the network before his exclusive contract with Netflix goes into effect. Episodes =Episode availability= Syndication history After completing its original run, ABC Daytime and ABC Saturday Morning continued to air the series until 1973. Bewitched has since been syndicated on many local US broadcast stations from 1973‚Äì82 and then since 1993, including Columbia TriStar Television as part of the Screen Gems Network syndication package from 1999‚Äì2001, which featured by 1999 bonus wraparound content during episode airings. From 1973 to 1982, the entire series was syndicated by Screen Gems/Columbia Pictures. By the late '70s, many local stations skipped the black and white episodes or only ran those in the summer due to a perception that black-and-white shows usually had less appeal than shows filmed in color. From 1981 to about 1991, only the color episodes were syndicated in barter syndication by DFS Program Exchange. The first two seasons, which were in black and white were not included and Columbia retained the rights to those. Beginning in 1989, Nick at Nite began airing only the black-and-white episodes, which were originally unedited back then. The edited ones continued in barter syndication until 1992. Columbia syndicated the entire series beginning in 1991. The remaining six color seasons were added to Nick at Nite's lineup in March 1998 in a week-long Dueling Darrins Marathon. Seasons 1‚Äì2 were later colorized and made available for syndication and eventually DVD sales. Cable television channel WTBS carried seasons 3‚Äì8 throughout the 1980s and 1990s from DFS on a barter basis like most local stations that carried the show did. The Hallmark Channel aired the show from 2001 to 2003; TV Land then aired the show from 2003 to 2006, and it returned in March 2010, but left the schedule in 2012. In October 2008, the show began to air on WGN America, and in October 2012 on Logo, limited to the middle seasons only. MeTV aired the show in conjunction with I Dream of Jeannie from December 31, 2012 to September 1, 2013. Cable and satellite network FETV also airs the show together with I Dream of Jeannie. The show now airs on Antenna TV. =Overseas markets= In Australia, this series aired on the Nine Network's digital channel GO! later it moved to the Seven Network's digital channels 7TWO later 7flix. Prior to this, the show aired in reruns on Network Ten in 1995 before moving to the Seven Network a year later. Russia-based channel Domashny aired the show from 2008 to 2010. Internet Selected episodes may be viewed on iTunes, YouTube, Internet Movie Database, Hulu, The Minisode Network, Crackle, and Amazon.com. The show also airs on free streaming TV station Pluto TV. Home media Beginning in 2005, Sony Pictures Home Entertainment released all eight seasons of Bewitched. In regions 1 and 4, seasons 1 and 2 were each released in two versions‚Äîone as originally broadcast in black-and-white, and one colorized. The complete series set only contains the colorized versions of Seasons 1‚Äì2. Only the colorized editions were released in regions 2 and 4. On August 27, 2013, it was announced that Mill Creek Entertainment had acquired the rights to various television series from the Sony Pictures library including Bewitched. They have subsequently re-released the first six seasons, with seasons 1 & 2 available only in their black and white versions. On October 6, 2015, Mill Creek Entertainment re-released Bewitched- The Complete Series on DVD in Region 1. Special features were stripped from the release. The first two seasons are in black and white only.

Electric Sheep is a distributed computing project for animating and evolving fractal flames, which are in turn distributed to the networked computers, which display them as a screensaver. Process The process is transparent to the casual user, who can simply install the software as a screensaver. Alternatively, the user may become more involved with the project, manually creating a fractal flame file for upload to the server where it is rendered into a video file of the animated fractal flame. As the screensaver entertains the user, their computer is also used for rendering commercial projects, sales of which keep the servers and developers running. There are about 500,000 active users (monthly uniques). According to Mitchell Whitelaw in his Metacreation: Art and Artificial Life, \\"On the screen they are luminous, twisting, elastic shapes, abstract tangles and loops of glowing filaments.\\"Mitchell Whitelaw (2004). Metacreation: Art and Artificial Life. MIT Press. pp 155. The name \\"Electric Sheep\\" is taken from the title of Philip K. Dick's novel Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?. The title mirrors the nature of the project: computers (androids) who have started running the screensaver begin rendering (dreaming) the fractal movies (sheep). The sheep motif is carried over into other aspects of the project: the 100 or so sheep stored on the server at any time is referred to as 'the flock'; creating a new fractal by interpolating or combining the sheep's fractal code with that of another sheep is called mating/breeding; changes to the code are called mutations, etc. The parameters that generate these movies (sheep) can be created in a few ways: they can be created and submitted by members of the electricsheep mailing list, members of the mailing list can download the parameters of existing sheep and tweak them, or sheep can be mated together automatically by the server or manually by server admins (nicknamed shepherds). Users may vote on sheep that they like or dislike, and this voting is used for the genetic algorithm which generates new sheep. Each movie is a fractal flame with several of its parameters animated. The individual frames of which these movies consist are rendered using 'spare' processing cycles from idle computers on the distributed network of those running the screensaver application, and finished sheep (in the form of .avi files) are distributed to the network. The computer-generated sheep parameters and movies are distributed under the Creative Commons Attribution Noncommercial (CC-BY- NC) license; user-generated sheep parameters are under the Creative Commons Attribution (CC-BY) license. Both are automatically downloaded by the screen saver. The underlying copyright issues raised by generative, distributed digital art projects involve novel legal issues that the current copyright system can not understand or handle. The screensaver was created and released as free software by Scott Draves in 1999 and continues to be developed by him and a team of about five engineers. The 2.7.x series differs from the old versions. It has a new logo, higher quality sheep and other features. It has switched to a freemium model in which the server software is not available and much of the computed data is not available under a free license, which led to its removal from Debian.

He is Georgia's \\"most universally revered hero.\\" Inspired by the contemporary liberal movements in Europe, as a writer and a public figure, Chavchavadze directed much of his efforts toward awakening national ideals in Georgians and to the creation of a stable society in his homeland. His most important literary works were: The Hermit, The Ghost, Otaraant Widow, Kako The Robber, Happy Nation, Letters of a Traveler and Is a man a human?!. He was editor-in-chief of the periodicals Sakartvelos Moambe (1863‚Äì77) and Iveria (1877‚Äì1905), and authored numerous articles for journals. He was a devoted protector of the Georgian language and culture from Russification. He is considered the main contributor of Georgian cultural nationalism. The three main ethnic markers of Georgian identity, according to Chavchavadze, consisted of territory, language, and religion. Despite this, his nationalism was secular. Chavchavadze was fatally wounded in Tsitsamuri, outside Mtskheta, by a gang of assassins. His legacy earned him the broad admiration of the Georgian people. In 1987 he was canonized as Saint Ilia the Righteous (, tsminda ilia martali) by the Georgian Orthodox Church. Today, Georgians revere Chavchavadze as The Uncrowned King (, ugvirgvino mepe) and the \\"Father of the Nation.\\"  Life  = Ancestry and early life = Chavchavadze in 1st Gymnasium of Tbilisi, 1848 Ilia Chavchavadze was born in Qvareli, a village in Kvareli, located in the Alazani Valley, in the Kakheti province of Georgia, which was part of the Russian Empire at that time. Ilia was a tavadi, the Georgian title of prince. It is thought that the noble Chavchavadze family came from the Pshav-Khevsureti region of Georgia, and, in 1726, King Constantine II granted the Chavchavadze family the rank of Prince in recognition of their knighthood and valor to the nation. This resulted in the family moving and settling in the Alazani Gorge in Kakheti. Ilia was the third son of Grigol Chavchavadze and Mariam Beburishvili. Grigol, like his father and his famous ancestors, had a military background. He, along with the local militiamen protected the village from numerous Dagestani invasions. This can be seen in the architecture of the Ilia Chavchavadze museum house in Kvareli, incorporating a Medieval castle style in the two-storey castle in the yard, which was designed to protect the house during invasions. Chavchavadze was educated at the elementary level by the deacon of the village before he moved to Tbilisi where he attended the prestigious Academy for Nobility in 1848. However, from an early age, Ilia was influenced by his parents who were highly educated in classical literature, Georgian history and poetry. From his parents, Ilia learned the inspiring stories of Georgian heroism in classical historical novels. In his autobiography, Ilia refers to his mother, Princess Mariam Chavchavadze, who knew most Georgian novels and poems by heart and encouraged her children to study them. Ilia also described the influence of the deacon's storytelling, which gave him an artistic inspiration, later applied in his novel writing. Ilia's mother, Mariam, died on 4 May 1848, when Ilia was ten years old, and his father asked his sister, Makrine, to help bring up the children. Aunt Makrine had a significant impact on Ilia's life, because, after 1852, when Ilia's father Grigol died, she was the only remaining caretaker of the family. In 1848, after the death of Princess Chavchavadze, Ilia was sent to Tbilisi by his father to begin his secondary education. Ilia attended a private school for three years before he entered the 1st Academy of Tbilisi in 1851. Soon after, Ilia's father died and Aunt Makrine looked after the family. His secondary school years were very stressful, due to his father's death. However, the Chavchavadze family suffered another devastating blow when Ilia's brother, Constantine, was killed during the Dagestani raid on Kakheti. Ilia expressed his anguish and grief in one of his first short-poems called Sorrow of a Poor Man. In addition to his personal problems, the political situation in Georgia worsened under the harsh authority of the Russian Empire, which played a destructive role to the nation and its culture. = Student years = Ilia Chavchavadze during his studies at the university in Saint Petersburg, 1860 After graduating from the academy, Ilia decided to continue his education at the University of St. Petersburg, Russia. Before leaving for St. Petersburg, Ilia composed one of his most remarkable poems, To the Mountains of Kvareli in the village of Kardanakhi on 15 April 1857, where he expressed his lifelong admiration for the Greater Caucasus Mountains and his sorrow at leaving his homeland. That same year, Ilia was admitted to the University of St. Petersburg. During his student years, numerous revolutions sprang up in Europe which Ilia observed with great interest. Ilia's attention focused on the events in Italy and the struggle of Giuseppe Garibaldi, whom he admired for many years. While in St.Petersburg, Ilia met Princess Catherine Chavchavadze, from whom he learned about the poetry and lyrics of the Georgian romantic Prince Nik'oloz Baratashvili. Due to the harsh climate in St Petersburg, Ilia became very ill and returned to Georgia for several months in 1859. Ilia finally returned to Georgia after the completion of his studies in 1861. During his journey back, Ilia wrote one of his greatest masterpieces, The Traveler's Diaries, where he outlines the importance of nation-building and provides an allegorical comparison of Mt. Kazbegi and the Tergi River in the Khevi region of Georgia.  Political life  Chavchavadze's house in Tbilisi. Iberia) founded and edited by Chavchavadze during his political career. The newspaper focused on the national liberation movement of Georgia in the late 1800s. Ilia's main political and social goals were based on Georgian patriotism. He radically advocated the revival of the use of the Georgian language, the cultivation of Georgian literature, the revival of autocephalous status for the Georgian national church, and, finally, the revival of Georgian statehood, which had ended when the country became part of the Russian Empire. As the number of supporters for his ideas grew, so did opposition among the leading Social Democrats like the Menshevik Noe Zhordania; their main aims were focused on battling the Tsarist autocracy and a democratic transformation of the Russian empire. This did not include the revival of a Georgian state or of a Georgian self-identity. Ilia was viewed as bourgeois and as an old aristocrat who failed to realize the importance of the revolutionary tide. In addition to his works described above, he was also the founder and chairman of many public, cultural and educational organizations (Society for the Spreading of Literacy Among Georgians, \\"The Bank of the Nobility\\", \\"The Dramatic Society\\", \\"The Historical-Ethnographical Society of Georgia\\", etc.). He was also a translator of British literature. His main literary works were translated and published in French, English, German, Polish, Ukrainian, Belarusian, Russian and other languages. Between 1906 and 1907, he was a member of the State Council (Gosudarstvennaya Duma) in Russia. His eclectic interests also led him to be a member of, among others, the Caucasian Committee of the Geographical Society of Russia, the Society of Ethnography and Anthropology of Moscow University, the Society of Orientalists of Russia and the Anglo-Russian Literary Society (London). Prince Chavchavadze briefly acted as a literary mentor to a young Joseph Stalin, who was then an Orthodox seminarian in Tbilisi. According to historian Simon Sebag Montefiore, > \\"The Prince was sufficiently impressed to show the teenagers work to his > editors. He admired Stalin's verse, choosing five poems to publish ‚Äì quite > an achievement. Prince Chavchavadze called Stalin the 'young man with the > burning eyes.'\\"Simon Sebag Montefiore, \\"Young Stalin,\\" page 57.  Death  Shot trajectory of Ilia Chavchavadze assassination Prince Chavchavadze's funeral in Tbilisi After serving as a member of the Upper House in the first Russian Duma, Ilia decided to return to Georgia in 1907. On 28 August 1907 Ilia Chavchavadze was murdered by a gang of six assassins who ambushed him and his wife Olga while traveling from Tbilisi to Saguramo, near Mtskheta. The prince's murder was seen as a national tragedy which was mourned by all strata of Georgian society. Prince Akaki Tsereteli, who was suffering from serious health problems at the time, spoke at the funeral and dedicated an outstanding oration to Ilia: \\"Ilia's inestimable contribution to the revival of the Georgian nation is an example for future generations\\".David Marshal Lang, History of Modern Georgia, p. 176. =Theories= The assassination of Ilia Chavchavadze remains controversial today. The \\"widely held suspicion\\" in his murder laid on the Bolsheviks from the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party. Chavchavadze publicly undermined the program of the Social Democrats. Furthermore, his socially conservative vision for Georgian nationalism and his tremendous popularity among the public may have been the causes. Historian Simon Sebag Montefiore suspects that Joseph Stalin may have been involved in planning his murder. According to Montefiore,Simon Sebag Montefiore, \\"Young Stalin,\\" page 179.  Legacy  Monument to Chavchavadze (left) and Akaki Tsereteli (right) in front of the first Gymnasium in Tbilisi The tomb of Ilia Chavchavadze in Mtatsminda Pantheon. As a result of Chavchavadze's death, the Georgian Social Democrats, especially the Mensheviks, started to gain significant power and support among the population. Eventually, after the temporary disengagement of Russia from Transcaucasia, Georgian Mensheviks decided to revive Georgian statehood and proclaimed the independence on 26 May 1918. After the Bolshevik occupation of Georgia and integration into the Soviet Union in 1921, Chavchavadze became for Georgian nationalists the symbol of Georgian freedom and national liberation. In 1987, Prince Chavchavadze was formally canonized by the Georgian Orthodox and Apostolic Church, as \\"Saint Ilia the Righteous.\\" In October 1987 the Ilia Chavchavadze Society, an organisation that promoted Georgian cultural revival and political autonomy, was established by dissident intellectuals. In 1989, during the anti-Soviet protests in Tbilisi, the poems, novels and political life of Chavchavadze became a driving force behind the Georgian struggle for independence. The idea of national revival, which Chavchavadze preached and advocated in various Georgian societies throughout his life, gained in momentum in 1990. In 2002, Mikheil Saakashvili created the United National Movement party which claimed the political legacy of Ilia Chavchavadze, and which played a major role in the so-called Rose Revolution of 2003 which ousted President Eduard Shevardnadze. In 1998 Stephen Kinzer wrote about the widespread admiration of Chavchavadze across political spectrum: \\"Today leftists in Georgia embrace Chavchavadze for his hatred of injustice, centrists love him for his nonviolent humanism, and right-wing nationalists have adopted his slogan Homeland, Language, Religion.\\"  Publications of Chavchavadze's works  * Georgische Dichter.

Iowa has the oldest creative writing program in the country offering an MFA credential. = Faculty and alumni = Current permanent faculty as of September 2020 are, Fiction- Jamel Brinkley, Charles D'Ambrosio, Margot Livesey. English and Creative Writing- Ethan Canin. Poetry- James Galvin, Mark Levine, Tracie Morris, Elizabeth Willis. Professor Emeritus Marilynne Robinson and Program Director and Elizabeth M. Stanley Professor in the Arts Lan Samantha Chang. Current Visiting Faculty are Alexia Arthurs, Tom Drury and Amy Parker. https://writersworkshop.uiowa.edu/people = Curriculum and courses = The program's curriculum requires students to take a small number of classes each semester, including the Graduate Fiction Workshop or Graduate Poetry Workshop itself, and one or two additional literature seminars. The modest requirements are intended to prepare the student for the realities of professional writing, where self-discipline is paramount. The graduate workshop courses meet weekly. Before each three-hour class, a small number of students submit material for critical reading by their peers. The class itself consists of a round-table discussion during which the students and the instructor discuss each piece. The specifics of how the class is conducted vary somewhat from teacher to teacher, and between poetry and fiction workshops. The ideal result is not only that authors come away with insights into the strengths and weaknesses of their own work, but that the class as a whole derives some insight, whether general or specific, about the process of writing. = Podcast = \\"Conversations from the Iowa Writer's Workshop\\" is an event put on by the program that is recorded and put online in podcast form.  Pulitzer Prizes won by graduates and faculty  , Iowa Writers' Workshop alumni won 17 Pulitzer Prizes, as well as numerous National Book Awards and other literary honors. Six U.S. Poets Laureate have been graduates of the workshop. Faculty and graduates affiliated with the Iowa Writers' Workshop have won 29 Pulitzer Prizes, including 16 won by graduates since 1947, and graduates and faculty of the University of Iowa have won over 40. = Fiction = *Robert Penn Warren, 1947 Pulitzer for All the King's Men, former faculty member. *Wallace Stegner, 1972 Pulitzer for Angle of Repose, MA, 1932; PhD, English, 1935. *James Alan McPherson, 1977 Pulitzer for Elbow Room, MFA, 1969; former faculty member. *John Cheever, 1979 Pulitzer for The Stories of John Cheever, former faculty member. *Jane Smiley, 1992 Pulitzer for A Thousand Acres, MA, 1975; MFA, English, 1976; PhD, English, 1978. *Philip Roth, 1998 Pulitzer for American Pastoral, former faculty member. *Michael Cunningham, 1999 Pulitzer for The Hours, MFA, English, 1980. *Marilynne Robinson, 2005 Pulitzer for Gilead, emeritus faculty member. *Paul Harding, 2010 Pulitzer for Tinkers, MFA, English, 2000. *Andrew Sean Greer, 2018 Pulitzer for Less, former visiting faculty member. *Flannery O'Connor, 1972 U.S. National Book Award for Fiction for Complete Stories *Madhuri Vijay, India, 2019 JCB Prize for Literature for The Far Field = Journalism = *Tracy Kidder, 1982 Pulitzer in general nonfiction for The Soul of a New Machine, MFA, 1974. = Poetry = *Karl Shapiro, 1945 Pulitzer for V-Letter and Other Poems, former faculty member. *Robert Lowell, 1947 Pulitzer for Lord Weary's Castle, 1974 Pulitzer for The Dolphin, former faculty member. *Robert Penn Warren, 1958 Pulitzer for Poems 1954‚Äì56, Now and Then, 1980 Pulitzer for Poems 1976‚Äì78, former faculty member. *W.

The Software Toolworks both developed and published the MS-DOS and Super NES versions in 1993, while the NES version was developed by Radical Entertainment and published by The Software Toolworks in 1994. The MS-DOS version was re- released as Mario's Time Machine Deluxe in 1996. Mario's Time Machine is one of several educational Mario video games that were released during the early 1990s; the game focuses on teaching human history. While the gameplay and engine varies between the three different versions, the story is roughly the same: the player assumes the role of Mario, who uses a time machine to return various artifacts, which had been stolen by Bowser, to their correct points in time. Mario's Time Machine received mixed to negative reviews since its release, holding an aggregate score of 60.25% on GameRankings based on two reviews. Its use as an educational title has been mixed, and the game has been compared to another educational history game, Where in Time Is Carmen Sandiego? Gameplay Mario about to travel through time to Cambridge in 1867, A.D.. Mario's Time Machine is set in the year 1993. Bowser, who has built a time machine called the \\"Timulator\\", travels back in time and steals essential artifacts from various points in human history to place on display in a museum inside his castle. Because these actions will eventually change history permanently, the player character Mario takes control of the Timulator to return the artifacts to their proper areas in time. In the NES version, Bowser also kidnaps Yoshi, who is freed upon completing the game. The gameplay focuses on teaching the player the historical significance of each artifact (and of the associated historical person); to progress through the game, the player must correctly answer questions relating to the learned information. Mario's Time Machine uses a side-scrolling perspective, with a game engine that varies across all three versions. The player controls Mario using a point-and-click interface in the MS-DOS version, while the console versions use a platforming-based control scheme adapted from Super Mario World, in which Mario can move left or right and jump. Like Mario Is Missing!, the console versions use a password system to order to resume play from a particular game state. The player begins Mario's Time Machine in Bowser's museum. The museum is the main hub, where the player obtains the artifacts and directly accesses all the game's levels (which consist of locations on Earth in different time periods) using the Timulator. In the Super NES and MS-DOS versions, for each artifact, the player is given the year and place it originated from. For example, the player learns that the \\"Apple\\" artifact originated from 1687 Cambridge. The player can then time travel using this information; time traveling itself is a minigame in which Mario surfs through a wide ocean, collecting mushrooms. Collecting enough mushrooms will transport Mario to the time period and location programmed into the Timulator. The player is given a short document describing the life and notability of the historical person associated (e.g. Isaac Newton), but the document itself has some of its terms missing. The player thus is required to converse with the non-player characters depicting the local denizens of the time period in order to learn various facts and be able to fill in the blanks. The player chooses the words from a list of pre-determined words; if the player incorrectly fills a blank more than twice, he is sent back to 1993 and is required to try again. When the player fills all the blanks correctly, he can then successfully return the artifact to its original owner. In the game's ending cutscene, Mario manages to confront Bowser, who then steals back the Timulator to make his escape. At this point there are three possible outcomes based on the player's overall performance: in the worst outcome, in which the player fails to return the artifacts quickly enough, Bowser successfully escapes to an area known as Paradise; in the other two outcomes, the Timulator experiences mechanical overload, sending and trapping Bowser in the Jurassic era. The NES version of Mario's Time Machine has a heavier emphasis on platforming than the other two versions. Despite the presence of enemies, Mario cannot lose lives or even take damage, so obtaining a game over is impossible. To obtain an artifact in Bowser's museum, the player plays a Mario Bros.-inspired minigame in which he fights Koopa Troopas. The player can then use the Timulator and travel to one of the fourteen selectable time periods. Unlike the other versions, the player is not explicitly told which time period the artifact originated from. The player is instead encouraged to explore the time periods and obtain hints, either from local denizens or from message blocks. Once the player figures out the artifact that belongs in that time period, he can then place the artifact in its original spot. After all the artifacts have been returned, the player is tasked to answer three random multiple choice questions pertaining to the historical periods visited. Answering the questions correctly will lead the player to the final boss fight with Bowser. The player wins the game upon Bowser's defeat. Development To capitalize on educational games, which gained popularity at the time, Nintendo partnered with The Software Toolworks to develop educational Mario games. Nintendo licensed the characters, but the company or Mario creator Shigeru Miyamoto were not involved in the game‚Äôs development. The MS-DOS and Super NES versions were developed by The Software Toolworks and published by Mindscape, while the NES version was developed by Radical Entertainment and published by Mindscape. Mario's Time Machine was originally released for computers in 1993, with a deluxe re-release titled Mario's Time Machine Deluxe in 1996. It was later released for the Super NES in December 1993, and for the NES on June 23, 1994. Reception Screenshot of the Nintendo Entertainment System version of Mario's Time Machine Since its release, Mario's Time Machine has received mixed reviews. It holds an aggregate score of 60.25% on GameRankings based on two reviews. GamePro praised the game's dialogues with historical figures, commenting that \\"the scenarios make flesh-and-blood human beings out of people who are usually just static pictures in textbooks.\\" They criticized that the Timulator controls are too confusing, especially for the game's targeted age group, but nonetheless summarized the game as both enjoyable and educational. Nintendo Power gave it a 2.65 out of five, while Electronic Gaming Monthly gave it a 6.75 out of 10. GameSpy's Brian Altano and Brian Miggels named its ending as one of the worst ever, criticizing it for showing Bowser crying. Fellow GameSpy editor Mike Drucker called it \\"half-assed.\\" GamesRadar commented that those who like this game may like Night at the Museum: Battle of the Smithsonian, which they gave a negative review to. They later suggested that it was an unpopular game, commenting that \\"five, maybe six people played the NES version of Mario's Time Machine\\". ABC Good Game called it \\"awful\\", and was \\"way too complicated for any school-aged youngster to understand.\\" Nintendo of Canada included a sealed copy of the NES version as part of a charity auction along with several other sealed NES games. In the book Video Games: A Guide for Savvy Parents, author David Sheff found the educational elements good, but criticized the gameplay. Authors David Wesley and Gloria Barczak associated Mario's Time Machine with the recent \\"flood of ill- conceived Mario spin-offs\\", arguing that these games nearly destroyed the Mario license. The Independents Janet Swift discussed Mario's Time Machine in her article on the latest generation of educational titles in 1994. She compared it to Mario Is Missing! in its execution, which she found \\"special\\", praising it for its educational value for children. Allgame's Brett Alan Weiss called the action scenes \\"dreadfully dull\\" and the presentation \\"merely average\\". He added that while he does not dislike educational games, they must be both \\"entertaining and enlightening.\\" IGN's Levi Buchanan included it in their assessment of the \\"other Mario games,\\" implying that the premise was boring and criticizing the game for lacking any real platform gameplay. He commented that it had \\"honorable intentions\\", but that it was \\"decidedly shallow\\". He also criticized the act of putting Mario in realistic time periods, commenting that he \\"occupies the imagination, a place with Star Festivals and giant piranha plants.\\" See also * Educational games in the Mario series References External links * Category:1993 video games Category:DOS games Category:Nintendo Entertainment System games Category:Radical Entertainment games Category:Super Nintendo Entertainment System games Category:Video games about time travel Category:Video games scored by Mark Knight Category:Video games developed in Canada Category:Video games developed in the United States Category:History educational video games Category:Single-player video games Time Machine Category:Children's educational video games ","title":"Mario's Time Machine"},{"id":"399415","text":"Operation Avalanche was the codename for the Allied landings near the port of Salerno, executed on 9 September 1943, part of the Allied invasion of Italy. The Italians withdrew from the war the day before the invasion, but the Allies landed in an area defended by German troops. Planned under the name Top Hat, it was supported by the deception plan Operation Boardman. The landings were carried out by the US Fifth Army, under American General Mark W. Clark. It comprised the U.S. VI Corps, the British X Corps and the US 82nd Airborne Division, a total of about nine divisions. Its primary objectives were to seize the port of Naples to ensure resupply, and to cut across to the east coast, trapping the Axis troops further south. In order to draw troops away from the landing ground, Operation Baytown was mounted. This was a landing by the British Eighth Army in Calabria in the 'toe' of Italy, on 3 September. Simultaneous sea landings were made by the British 1st Airborne Division at the port of Taranto (Operation Slapstick). British General Bernard Montgomery had predicted Baytown would be a waste of effort because it assumed the Germans would give battle in Calabria; if they failed to do so, the diversion would not work. He was proved correct. After Baytown the Eighth Army marched north to the Salerno area against no opposition other than engineer obstacles. The Salerno landings were carried out without previous naval or aerial bombardment in order to achieve surprise. Surprise was not achieved. As the first wave approached the shore at Paestum a loudspeaker from the landing area proclaimed in English, \\"Come on in and give up. We have you covered.\\" The troops attacked nonetheless. The Italians had established artillery and machine-gun posts and scattered tanks through the landing zones which made progress difficult, but the beach areas were captured. Around 07:00 a concerted counterattack was made by the 16th Panzer Division. It caused heavy casualties, but was beaten off. Both the British and the Americans made slow progress, and still had a gap between them at the end of day one. They linked up by the end of day two and occupied of coastline to a depth of . Over 12‚Äì14 September the Italians organized a concerted counterattack by six divisions of motorized troops, hoping to throw the Salerno beachhead into the sea before it could link with the British Eighth Army. Heavy casualties were inflicted, as the Allied troops were too thinly spread to be able to resist concentrated attacks. The outermost troops were therefore withdrawn in order to reduce the perimeter. The new perimeter was held with the assistance of naval and aerial support, although the German attacks reached almost to the beaches in places. Allied fighter pilots slept under the wings of their aircraft, in order to beat a hasty retreat to Sicily in the event Italian forces with their German support broke the beachhead.  Allied strategy  Map of the Invasion of Italy. Following the defeat of the Italian Forces and Afrika Korps in North Africa, there was disagreement between the Allies as to what the next step should be. Winston Churchill in particular wanted to invade Italy, which he called the \\"underbelly of Europe\\" (commonly misquoted as \\"soft underbelly\\"). Popular support in Italy for the war was declining, and he believed an invasion would remove Italy, and thus the influence of the Italian Navy (Regia Marina) in the Mediterranean Sea, opening it to Allied traffic. This would make it much easier to supply Allied forces in the Middle East and Far East, and increase British and American supplies to the Soviet Union. In addition, it would tie down German forces, keeping them away from the planned invasion of Normandy ‚Äì Operation Overlord. However, General George Marshall and much of the American staff wanted to undertake no operations that might delay the Normandy invasion. When it became clear that Operation Overlord could not be undertaken in 1943, it was agreed forces in North Africa should be used to invade Sicily, with no commitment made to any follow-up operations. Joint Allied Forces Headquarters AFHQ were operationally responsible for all Allied land forces in the Mediterranean theatre and it was they who planned and commanded the invasion of Sicily and the Italian mainland. The Allied invasion of Sicily in July 1943, codenamed Operation Husky, was highly successful, although many of the Axis forces there were allowed to avoid capture and escape to the mainland. More importantly a coup deposed Benito Mussolini as head of the Italian government, which then began approaching the Allies to make peace. It was believed a quick invasion of Italy might hasten an Italian surrender and produce quick military victories over the German troops that would now be trapped fighting in a hostile country. However, Italian (and more so German) resistance proved relatively strong, and fighting in Italy continued even after the fall of Berlin. In addition, the invasion left the Allies in a position of supplying food and supplies to conquered territory, a burden which would otherwise have fallen on Germany. As well, Italy occupied by a hostile German army would have created additional problems for the German Commander-in-Chief Albrecht von Kesselring.  The plan  The main landings were scheduled one week later, 9 September. The main force would land around Salerno on the western coast in Operation Avalanche. It would consist of the US Fifth Army under General Mark W. Clark, comprising the U.S. VI Corps under Ernest J. Dawley, the X British Corps under Richard McCreery, and the US 82nd Airborne Division in reserve, a total of about nine divisions. Its primary objectives were to seize the port of Naples to ensure resupply, and to cut across to the east coast, trapping Axis troops further south. The inclusion of the 82nd Airborne as a reserve force was possible only with the cancellation of Operation Giant II. The 1st British Airborne would be landed by sea near Taranto, on the \\"heel\\" of Italy in Operation Slapstick, as a diversion for Salerno. Their task was to capture the port and several nearby airfields and link with the Eighth Army before pressing north to join the Fifth Army near Foggia. The plan was deeply flawed. The 5th Army would be landing on a very broad 35-mile front, using only three assault divisions, and the two corps were widely separated both in distance and by a river. Furthermore, the terrain was highly favorable to the defender. A Ranger force under Colonel William O. Darby consisting of three US Ranger battalions and two British Commando units was tasked with holding the mountain passes leading to Naples, but no plan existed for linking the Ranger force up with X Corps' follow-up units. Finally, although tactical surprise was unlikely, Clark ordered no naval preparatory bombardment take place, despite experience in the Pacific Theatre demonstrating it was absolutely necessary. Approximately eight German divisions were positioned to cover possible landing sites, including the Hermann Goering Division, 26th and 16th Panzer, the 15th and 29th Panzergrenadier, and the 1st and 2nd Fallschirmj√§ger.

At Salerno the decision had been taken to assault without previous naval or aerial bombardment, in order to secure surprise. Tactical surprise was not achieved, as the naval commanders had predicted. As the first wave approached the shore at Paestum a loudspeaker from the landing area proclaimed in English, \\"Come on in and give up. We have you covered.\\" The troops attacked nonetheless. The Italians had established artillery and machine-gun posts and scattered tanks through the landing zones which made progress difficult, but the beach areas were successfully taken. Around 07:00 a concerted counterattack was made by the 16th Panzer division. It caused heavy casualties, but was beaten off with naval gunfire support. Both the British and the Americans made slow progress, and still had a 10 mile gap between them at the end of day one. They linked up by the end of day two and occupied 35‚Äì45 miles of coast line to a depth of six or seven miles. During September 12‚Äì14 the Italians organized a concerted counterattack with six divisions of motorised troops, hoping to throw the Salerno beachhead into the sea before it could link with the British 8th Army. Heavy casualties were inflicted, as the Allied troops were too thinly spread to be able to resist concentrated attacks. The outermost troops were therefore withdrawn in order to reduce the perimeter. The new perimeter was held with the assistance of 4000 paratroopers from the 82nd and 509th PIB who air dropped near the hot spots, from strong naval gunfire support, and from well-served Fifth Army artillery. The German attacks reached almost to the beaches but ultimately failed. General Clark was awarded the Distinguished Service Cross, the second- highest US award for valor in combat, for his front-line leadership during this crisis. He was frequently seen in the most forward positions encouraging the troops. However, in the estimate of historian Carlo D'Este, Clark's poor planning of the operation caused the crisis in the first place.. The Salerno battle was also the site of a mutiny by about 600 men of the British 10th Corps, who on September 16 refused assignment to new units as replacements. They had previously understood that they would be returning to their own units from which they had been separated during the fighting in the North African Campaign, mainly because they had been wounded. Eventually the Corps commander, McCreery, persuaded most of the men to follow their orders. The NCOs who led the mutiny were sentenced to death, but were eventually allowed to rejoin units and the sentence was not carried out.  The Italian strategy changes  German prepared defensive lines south of Rome. The German 10th Army had come very close to overwhelming the Salerno beachhead. The Allies had been fortunate that at this time Adolf Hitler had sided with the view of his Army Group commander in Northern Italy, Field Marshall Erwin Rommel, and decided that defending Italy south of Rome was not a strategic priority. As a result, the Army Group Commander in southern Italy, Field Marshall Albert Kesselring had been forbidden to call upon reserves from the northern Army Group. The subsequent success of the German 10th Army's defensive campaign in inflicting very heavy casualties on both U.S. 5th and British 8th Armies and Kesselring's strategic arguments that the Allies should be kept as far away from Germany as possible led Hitler to change his mind in October at which point he withdrew Rommel to oversee the build-up of defenses in northern France and gave Kesselring command of the whole of Italy with a remit to keep Rome in German hands for the longest time possible.  Further Allied advances  With the Salerno beachhead secure, the 5th Army could begin to attack northwest towards Naples. The 8th Army had been making quick progress from the \\"toe\\" in the face of German engineer delaying actions and linked with the 1st Airborne Division on the Adriatic coast. It united the left of its front with the 5th Army's right on 16 September, and advancing up the Adriatic coast captured the airfields near Foggia on 27 September. Foggia was a major Allied objective because the large airfield complex there would give the Allied air forces the ability to strike new targets in France, Germany and the Balkans. The 5th Army captured Naples on 1 October, and reached the line of the Volturno River on October 6. This provided a natural barrier, securing Naples, the Campanian Plain and the vital airfields on it from counterattack. Meanwhile, on the Adriatic coast, the British 8th Army had advanced to a line from Campobasso to Larino and Termoli on the Biferno river. Thus, by early October, the whole of southern Italy was in Allied hands, and the Allied armies now stood facing the Volturno Line, the first of a series of prepared defensive lines running across Italy from which the Germans chose to fight delaying actions, giving ground slowly and buying time to complete their preparation of the Winter Line, their strongest defensive line south of Rome. The next stage of the Italian Campaign became for the Allied armies a grinding and attritional slog against skillful, determined and well prepared defenses in terrain and weather conditions which favoured defense and hampered the Allied advantages in mechanised equipment and air superiority. It took until mid-January 1944 to fight through the Volturno, Barbara and Bernhardt lines to reach the Gustav Line, the backbone of the Winter Line defenses, setting the scene for the four Battles of Monte Cassino which took place between January and May 1944.

The precursor of the flag was first flown during the 1846 Bear Flag Revolt and was also known as the Bear Flag. Current flag The flag of California on display at the California State Capitol =Law and protocol= Metrics for the Flag of California The first official version of the Bear Flag was adopted by the California State Legislature and signed into law by Governor Hiram Johnson in 1911 as the official state flag. The 1911 statute stated: Vertical display In 1953, the design and specifications for the state flag were standardized in a bill signed by Governor Earl Warren and illustrated by Donald Graeme Kelley of Marin County, California. The California state flag is often called the \\"Bear Flag\\" and in fact, the present statute adopting the flag, California Government Code ¬ß 420, states: \\"The Bear Flag is the State Flag of California.\\" Pursuant to Section 439 of the California Government Code, the regulations and protocols for the proper display of the flag of California is controlled by the California Adjutant General: When the flag is displayed vertically, it is rotated 90 degrees clockwise such that the bear and star face upward and red stripe is on the left. The flag is also used as the state ensign. =Design= The modern state flag is white with a wide red strip along the bottom. There is a red star in the upper left corner and a grizzly bear facing left (toward the hoist) in the center, walking on a patch of green grass. The size of the bear is 2/3 the size of the hoist width and has a ratio of 2 by 1. The grass plot has a ratio of 11 to 1. The five-point star is taken from the California Lone Star Flag of 1836. \\"Monarch\\" the bear Finally accepted official rendering of the bear The bear on one 1911 version of the flag is claimed to have been modeled on the last California grizzly bear in captivity. The bear, named \\"Monarch\\", was captured in 1889 by newspaper reporter Allen Kelley, at the behest of William Randolph Hearst. The bear was subsequently moved to Woodwards Gardens in San Francisco, and then to the zoo at Golden Gate Park. After the bear's death in 1911, it was mounted and preserved at the Academy of Sciences at Golden Gate Park. While the bear flag was adopted in 1911, until 1953 the image of the bear varied depending on the flag manufacturer, and was finally standardized based on an image of Monarch. In 1953 the bear image was standardized based on an 1855 watercolor by Charles Christian Nahl. The 1953 law includes an official black and white rendering of the bear as well as the plot of grass and brown tufts. This drawing and other specifications that define the flag's colors and dimensions are identified as \\"54-J-03\\". In 2001, the North American Vexillological Association surveyed its members on the designs of the 72 U.S. state, U.S. territorial, and Canadian provincial flags and ranked the flag of California 13th. =Colors= The 1953 legislation defined the exact shades of the California flag with a total of five colors (including the white field) relative to the 9th edition of the Standard Color Card of America (now called the Standard Color Reference of America).

History =Lone Star of California= Last known California Lone Star flag, now held at The Gene Autry Western Museum in Los Angeles 1836 California Lone Star Flag In 1836, a coup led by Juan Alvarado declared Alta California's independence from Mexico. Declaring himself governor, Alvarado recruited American frontiersmen, led by Isaac Graham, to support him. The rebels easily captured the capital Monterey, but were unable to convince southern leaders such as Juan Bandini and Carlos Antonio Carrillo to join the rebellion. Faced with a civil war, Alvarado and the other Californios negotiated a compromise with the central government wherein California's leaders accepted its status as a \\"department\\" under the \\"Siete Leyes\\" Mexican constitution of 1836, in return for more local control. Alvarado was appointed governor the next year. The Lone Star Flag of California, associated with Alvarado's rebellion, contained a single red star on a white background. One last original flag is archived at the Autry National Center. =Original Bear Flag= The original 1846 Bear Flag with its designer, Peter Storm, c. 1870 Digital reproduction of the first Bear Flag Bear Flag monument on the Sonoma Plaza Todd's original Bear Flag, photographed in 1890 Digital reproduction of Todd's Bear Flag. Digital reproduction of the first official Bear Flag, credited to Pio Pico, affixed to the bottom of California's Declaration of Independence of 1846 The original Grizzly Bear Flag was designed by Peter Storm. Versions of Storm's Bear Flag were raised for the first time in Sonoma, California, in June 1846 on a date between the 14th and the 17th, by the men who became known as the \\"Bear Flaggers\\", including William B. Ide. The exact creation date is at least somewhat unclear. However, U.S. Naval Lieutenant John Missroon reported the flag's existence as of June 17, 1846. One Bear Flag was designed by William L. Todd, a cousin of Mary Todd Lincoln. According to the book Flags Over California, published by the California Military Department, the star on the flag began in the 1836 California Lone Star Flag. William Todd, in an 1878 letter to the Los Angeles Express, states that the star was drawn using blackberry juice and in recognition of the California Lone Star Flag. The bear was designed to be a symbol of strength and unyielding resistance. According to the Sonoma State Historic Park, the construction of the flag was described as such: The bear on the first bear flag and other early bear flags more closely resembles the more common American black bear than a grizzly, seen in the lack of shoulder hump and narrower muzzle. Moreover, the first bear flag closely resembles the coat of arms of Bern, Switzerland, its capital city. The coat of arms displays a black bear walking toward the left with fierce claws and a protruding tongue. Switzerland was the home country of John Sutter, who established Sutter's Fort, in the area which would spawn the California Gold Rush and eventually become Sacramento, California's state capital. The original Bear Flag and the republic it symbolized had a brief career, from about June 14 until July 9. On July 7, 1846, Commodore John Drake Sloat of the United States Navy's Pacific Squadron first raised the 28-star American flag at Monterey, the capital of Alta California, and claimed the territory for the United States. The state flag flying at San Francisco City Hall Two days later, on July 9, 1846, Navy Lieutenant Joseph Warren Revere arrived in Sonoma and hauled down the Bear Flag, running up in its place the Stars and Stripes. The Bear Flag was given to young John E. Montgomery (son of Commander John B. Montgomery of ), who would later write in a letter to his mother \\"Cuffy came down growling\\"--\\"Cuffy\\" being his nickname for the bear on the flag. The Bear Flag given to young Montgomery returned with USS Portsmouth to the east coast of the U.S. in 1848, but in 1855 was returned to California. The flag was given to California's two senators John B. Weller and William M. Gwin. This flag was donated to the Society of California Pioneers on September 8, 1855, and was preserved at the Society's Pioneer Halls in San Francisco until it was destroyed on April 18, 1906, in the fires that followed the great San Francisco earthquake. Today, a replica hangs on display in the Sonoma Barracks, or El Presidio de Sonoma. There is also a statue in the plaza at Sonoma, California, commemorating the raising of the flag, the Bear Flag Monument. =The Civil War period = During the secession crisis and the early part of the American Civil War in 1861, California was divided between supporters of the union and supporters of southern secession. In the months leading up to the war some opposed to the government in Los Angeles County and San Bernardino County showed support for secession by flying variants of the Bear Flag instead of the Stars and Stripes.

The only Confederate flag captured in California during the Civil War. Digital reproduction of the Gillis flag During the war, Union soldiers protected the West against secessionists who ran up Confederate flags in many places, including above the California statehouse in Sacramento, then disappearing before they could be caught. On July 4, 1861, during Independence Day celebrations in Sacramento, Democrat and veteran, Maj. J. P. Gillis celebrated the independence of the United States from Britain and the secession of the Confederacy by unfurling a flag based on the first Confederate flag, the Stars and Bars, but containing seventeen stars rather than the Confederate banner's seven, and marching down the street to the cheers of proslavery individuals. Unionist Jack Biderman denounced Gillis, tore the flag from his hands, and taunted secessionists to try to take the flag back. No one tried. Because Gillis' flag was seized by Jack Biderman, it is referred to either as the \\"Biderman Flag\\" or the \\"Gillis Flag.\\" Flag of the Governor The flag of the Governor of California The flag of the governor of California consists of the seal of California centered on a field of azure. Like most U.S. governors' flags, there are four five- point stars at the corners of the field.

He played his entire 15-year Major League Baseball career as a catcher for the Detroit Tigers. The premier catcher in the American League for several years from the 1960s into the early 1970s, he was named an All-Star in each of the 11 seasons in which he caught at least 75 games, and was the MVP runner-up for the 1968 World Series champions, handling a pitching staff that included World Series MVP Mickey Lolich and regular season MVP Denny McLain, who became the first 30-game winner in the majors since 1934. A five-time Gold Glove Award winner, Freehan held the major league record for highest career fielding percentage (.9933) until 2002, and also the records for career putouts (9,941) and total chances (10,734) from 1975 until the late 1980s; he ranked ninth in major league history in games caught (1,581) at the end of his career. His career totals of 200 home runs and 2,502 total bases placed him behind only Yogi Berra and Bill Dickey among AL catchers when he retired. Major league career Freehan attended the University of Michigan, where he set an all-time Big Ten Conference batting mark of .585 in 1961 and also played football. He signed with his hometown Tigers in 1961 for a $100,000 bonus, which his father withheld until he graduated in 1966, and broke in briefly with 4 games at the end of the season before returning to the minors in 1962. In 1963 he arrived in the majors to stay, working with former catcher Rick Ferrell on his defense and splitting catching duties with Gus Triandos, who was traded following the season. The 1964 campaign gave indications of what was to come; he batted .300 to finish sixth in the American League (AL), along with 18 home runs and 80 runs batted in. He also led the AL by throwing out 53% of potential base stealers, earned the first of his ten consecutive All-Star selections, and placed seventh in the Most Valuable Player Award balloting. In 1965 he led the AL in putouts for the first of six times, and received the first of his five consecutive Gold Gloves. In 1966 he again led the league in putouts, and also led in fielding percentage for the first of four times. 1967 was his best season yet, as he batted .282 - ninth in the AL as averages hit an all-time low - with 20 home runs, and broke Elston Howard's 1964 AL single-season records with 950 putouts and 1,021 total chances. Freehan led the league in both intentional walks and times hit by pitch, and finished third in the MVP voting after Detroit came within one game of the Boston Red Sox for the AL pennant. Freehan wearing protective catcher's gear as a member of the Detroit Tigers in 1966. He had an even better year in 1968 as he was considered the quiet leader of the 1968 World Series championship squad. In a year marked by dominant pitching, he posted career highs with 25 home runs and 84 RBI, fifth and sixth in the AL respectively. Freehan broke his own records with 971 putouts and 1,050 total chances, marks which remained league records until Dan Wilson topped them with the 1997 Seattle Mariners. He was also hit by 24 pitches, the most in the AL since Kid Elberfeld in 1911. Despite playing in hitter-friendly Tiger Stadium, Freehan guided the Tigers' pitching staff to an earned run average of 2.71, third best in the league. McLain won 31 games and Lolich won 17 as the Tigers ran away with the pennant. Because of his offensive and defensive contributions, he finished second to McLain in the MVP voting. Freehan and Carl Yastrzemski were the only players to finish in the top ten of the voting in both 1967 and 1968, and only Yastrzemski reached base more often in 1968. He capped his season by recording the final out of the World Series against the St. Louis Cardinals, retiring Tim McCarver on a popup. He also made a pivotal play in Game 5, with the Cardinals leading the Series 3-1 and the game 3-2. In the fifth inning, Lou Brock - whom Freehan had thrown out on an attempted steal in the third inning - doubled with one out and attempted to score on Juli√°n Javier's single, but Freehan successfully blocked the plate with his foot, and held on to the ball even though Brock came in standing up in an attempt to knock the ball loose. Detroit won by scoring three runs in the seventh inning, and went on to take the last two games. Although his later seasons rarely approached the brilliance of those two campaigns, he continued to turn out All-Star years for the Tigers. His offensive numbers dipped in 1970, but he threw out 47% of potential base stealers (his highest mark since 1964) and had a .997 fielding percentage. In 1971 he batted .277 with 21 home runs, three of those coming in one game against the Boston Red Sox in August. He hit .262 for the 1972 Eastern Division champions. He missed the first two games (both losses) of the 1972 American League Championship Series against the Oakland Athletics while recovering from a hairline fracture of his thumb, then doubled and homered in a 3-0 Game 3 win, in which Joe Coleman set a League Championship Series record with 14 strikeouts. Freehan drove in the first of three runs in the tenth inning of Game 4 in a memorable 4-3 come- from-behind victory which tied the series; he also drove in Detroit's only run in the 2-1 Game 5 loss. In 1974, playing primarily at first base, he finished fifth in the American League in slugging average with a .479 mark. He moved back behind the plate the following year to earn his 11th All-Star berth. Freehan ended his career in 1976, batting .270. Career statistics In his 15-year career, Freehan played in 1,774 games with 1,591 hits in 6,073 at bats for a .262 batting average along with 241 doubles, 200 home runs, 758 RBI, and a .340 on-base percentage. In addition to his home runs and total bases, his .412 slugging average and totals of 1,591 hits, 706 runs and 476 extra base hits all put him among the top five AL catchers to that time. His batting totals are particularly remarkable in light of the fact that offense was at a low throughout the sport during his career, with a decided advantage toward pitchers. Freehan led all AL catchers in fielding percentage four times (1965, 1966, 1970, 1973). He also ranked sixth in American League history with 114 times being hit by a pitch. Freehan caught more games than any other player in Tigers' team history. In his book, The Bill James Historical Baseball Abstract, baseball historian Bill James ranked Freehan 12th all-time among major league catchers. Freehan held the major league record for highest career fielding percentage (.9933) until , when Dan Wilson broke his record. In 1973 and 1974 he surpassed Yogi Berra to become the AL's all-time leader in putouts and total chances; he broke Johnny Roseboro's major league marks in 1975. Bob Boone broke his major league mark of 10,734 career total chances in 1987, and Gary Carter surpassed his putouts total of 9,941 in 1988; Carlton Fisk broke his AL records in 1989 (total chances) and 1990 (putouts). Freehan caught 114 shutouts during his career, ranking him 18th all-time among major league catchers. In 1969, Freehan penned \\"Behind the Mask\\", a diary-type recording of his thoughts and experiences as seen from the catcher's perspective. After retiring, he coached Tigers catcher Lance Parrish on the fine points of playing his position. In 1978, Freehan was one of seven members of the inaugural class of inductees to the University of Michigan Athletic Hall of Honor. He served as a color commentator for Seattle Mariners broadcasts in 1979‚Äì80, and for Tigers broadcasts on PASS Sports television in 1984‚Äì85, and returned to the University of Michigan as head coach of the baseball team from 1989 to 1995. Personal life In 1963, he married Pat Freehan. Freehan was diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease in his later years. In October 2018, it was revealed that Freehan was in hospice care at his home in Northern Michigan.

He played in Major League Baseball as a left- handed pitcher from 1962 until 1979, most notably for the Detroit Tigers. A three-time All-Star, Lolich is most notable for his performance in the 1968 World Series against the St. Louis Cardinals when he earned three complete- game victories, including a win over Bob Gibson in the climactic Game 7. At the time of his retirement in 1979, Lolich held the Major League Baseball record for career strikeouts by a left-handed pitcher. Early years Lolich was born in Portland, Oregon. He is of Croatian descent.Croatian Chronicle Network 35 Pacific Northwest Croatian Athletes He was born right-handed and began to throw left-handed after a childhood accident. At age two, he rode his tricycle into a parked motorcycle, which fell on him. The accident broke his left collar bone, requiring him to wear a cast for four months. Post-injury efforts to strengthen the left arm helped Lolich develop into throwing left- handed.(The Joe Falls account indicates the left shoulder was broken and attributed the strength of the left arm to post-injury efforts to strengthen the arm.) Known as an eccentric, a sports writer in 1964 wrote of Lolich: \\"He now eats, writes and bats right-handed, pitches left-handed and thinks sideways.\\" As a teenager, he excelled playing in American Legion Baseball and in the Babe Ruth League, setting Oregon state records for strikeouts. He attended Lincoln High School in Portland and posted a record of 19 wins against 5 losses for the school team in 1958. Professional baseball =Knoxville and Durham= Lolich was signed by the Detroit Tigers as an amateur free agent at age 17 on June 30, 1958. He began his professional career playing the 1959, 1960, and 1961 seasons with the Knoxville Smokies of the South Atlantic League and the Durham Bulls of the Carolina League. In his first three seasons, he compiled a 17‚Äì29 record in 82 games. =Denver and Portland= Lolich was assigned to the Triple-A Denver Bears at the start of the 1962 season and went 0‚Äì4 with a 16.50 ERA in nine games. After the poor start, Detroit ordered him back to Knoxville. Lolich refused to report to Knoxville and was placed under indefinite suspension. He returned home to Oregon and struck out all 12 batters he faced in a four-inning outing in semi- pro ball with the Archer Blower team in Portland. In early June, Lolich was acquired by the Portland Beavers of the Pacific Coast League in a deal with the Tigers. Lolich turned his career around, compiling a 10‚Äì9 record and 3.95 ERA with 138 strikeouts in 23 games with the Beavers. The key to Lolich's turnaround was finding control of his pitches. He had developed a reputation as \\"a flamethrowing wildman\\" in the minors but developed his control while playing for Portland. =Detroit Tigers= 1963‚Äì1967 Buoyed by a strong performance with Portland, Lolich was reclaimed by the Tigers in 1963. He irked Detroit's management by reporting late to spring training, saying he had remained in Portland to take an examination to become a mailman during the off-season. He was cut by the Tigers on April 3 and optioned to the Syracuse Chiefs, then recalled to Detroit on May 9 after compiling a 2.45 ERA in 22 innings at Syracuse. He made his major league debut on May 12 and secured his first win on May 28, allowing one run in nine innings against the Los Angeles Angels. He was plagued by lack of run support during his rookie campaign, losing a 2‚Äì1 decision on July 29, allowing only one hit through 8‚Öì innings before giving up a home run in the ninth inning. He finished the 1963 season with a 5‚Äì9 record, 3.55 ERA, and 103 strikeouts in 144‚Öì innings pitched. Lolich blossomed in 1964 with an 18‚Äì9 record and 3.41 ERA in 232 innings pitched. He pitched his first shutout, a three-hitter against the Minnesota Twins, on April 24th. On September 9, he pitched his sixth shutout of the season and struck out 12 Yankees. For the season, Lolich ranked fourth in the American League with six shutouts and fifth with 192 strikeouts. In November 1964, Lolich married Joyce Fleenor, a former airline stewardess from Los Angeles. At spring training in 1965, Lolich told reporter Joe Falls that marriage had a calming influence on him: \\"She's done so much for me, to settle me down, that I can hardly put it into words. She's made me a very happy guy.\\" In 1965, he compiled a 15‚Äì9 record with a 3.44 ERA. His 226 strikeouts ranked second in the American League behind Sam McDowell. Always known as a weak hitter, Lolich hit .058 and struck out 37 times in 86 at-bats during the 1965 season. After two strong seasons, Lolich regressed in 1966. His ERA jumped by more than a run to 4.77, and he compiled a 14‚Äì14 record in 40 games. After the season, Lolich rejected claims that his weight was the problem. He noted that he weighed 200 pounds when he won 18 games in 1964 and weighed only two pounds more in 1966. Lolich instead opined: \\"The big problem for me was loss of concentration. I blew a lot of leads this year.\\" In 1967, the Tigers hired former major league pitcher Johnny Sain as their pitching coach. Sain helped develop Lolich's pitching skills and taught him psychological aspects of pitching. The 1967 season was a memorable one for the tight four-way pennant race among the Tigers, Boston Red Sox, Minnesota Twins and Chicago White Sox. The Tigers were in contention until the final day of the 1967 season, finishing one game behind the Red Sox. Lolich finished the season with a 14‚Äì13 record, but led the league with six shutouts. In late July 1967, Lolich was called to active duty with the Michigan Air National Guard in response to the ongoing riot. Lolich spent twelve days on active duty and was promoted to Airman First Class. Upon returning to the team, he received death threats, allegedly from the Black Panthers, for his role in quelling the riot. In response, the Federal Bureau of Investigation placed a team of snipers on the roof of Tiger Stadium during his following two starts. 1968 World Series championship In 1968, the Tigers quickly rose to first place, winning nine straight after losing the season opener to Boston. Lolich was overshadowed by teammate Denny McLain's 31-win season, and was sent to the bullpen in August due to a late-season slump. He made six appearances as a relief pitcher before returning to the starting rotation. He posted a 17‚Äì9 record with 197 strikeouts, as the Tigers won the American League pennant by 12 games over the second-place Baltimore Orioles. After Bob Gibson defeated McLain in Game 1 of the 1968 World Series in St. Louis, Lolich helped Detroit recover by allowing only one run to win Game 2 8‚Äì1. He also helped his own cause by hitting the only home run of his 16-year career. But the Tigers lost the next two games at home to fall behind the Cardinals 3‚Äì1 and were facing elimination when Lolich returned to pitch in Game 5, just four days after pitching a complete game. Despite an unsettled start, when he surrendered an RBI single to Curt Flood and a two-run home run to Orlando Cepeda in the first inning, Lolich remained calm and proceeded to pitch eight scoreless innings as the Tigers scored two runs in the fourth and took the lead in the seventh on Al Kaline's bases loaded two-run single. They added another run for a 5‚Äì3 win, staving off elimination. Back in St. Louis, the Tigers then won Game 6 by a score of 13‚Äì1 behind McLain's solid pitching and a grand slam home run from Jim Northrup in a Series-record-tying ten-run third inning rally to force Game 7. With just two days of rest, and having pitched two complete games in the past week, Lolich faced Gibson in Game 7, both having won their previous two starts. They each pitched six scoreless innings, Lolich picking off Lou Brock and Curt Flood to end a Cardinal threat in the bottom of the sixth, before the Tigers broke through with three runs in the top of the seventh starting with a two- out, two-run triple to deep center by Northrup just over Flood's head for an eventual 4‚Äì1 Tigers win and a 4‚Äì3 Series triumph. Detroit became only the third team in World Series history to rally from a 3‚Äì1 series deficit to win in seven games. Having completed Game 7, Lolich became the 12th pitcher to win three games in a World Series, and the last with three complete games in a single Series. He was the last pitcher with three victories in the same World Series until Randy Johnson won 3 games in the 2001 World Series. He is the only left-handed pitcher with three complete-game wins in the same World Series in baseball history. No other pitcher has thrown three complete game World Series victories in the same series since. Lolich's performance earned him the World Series Most Valuable Player Award. 1969‚Äì1975 In 1969, Lolich won 19 games and earned his first All-Star selection. He struck out 16 batters in a game twice in 1969, his career high. In 1971, he led the American league with 25 wins, an impressive 29 complete games and 308 strikeouts, all career-highs. His 308 strikeouts is also a Tigers' team record. Lolich became known for his endurance and his ability to pitch complete games. He reached the 300-innings pitched mark every season between 1971 and 1974. He finished second to Vida Blue in the 1971 Cy Young Award voting. Lolich won 22 games and posted a career-best 2.50 ERA in 1972 to help the Tigers win the American League Eastern Division championship. He pitched impressively in the 1972 American League Championship Series against the Oakland Athletics, posting a 1.42 ERA in two starts. In Game 1, he pitched 10 innings allowing only 1 run before losing the game in the bottom of the 11th inning on an unearned run. He pitched nine innings in Game 4, again allowing only 1 run, but the win went to reliever John Hiller as the Tigers rallied in the 10th inning. The Tigers eventually lost the series to Oakland in five games. He finished third in the 1972 Cy Young Award voting behind Gaylord Perry and Wilbur Wood. Lolich as a member of the Detroit Tigers in 1975. Lolich won 16 games in 1973 and 1974. However, the Tigers dropped to last place in the American League East. In 1975, Lolich eclipsed Warren Spahn‚Äôs Major League Baseball record of 2,583 career strikeouts by a left-handed pitcher. Although Lolich pitched effectively in 1975, the Tigers' poor performance continued as they failed to provide him with much offensive support. He received only 14 runs of support during a 14-game stretch in which his win-loss record was 1‚Äì13, even though he managed to post a respectable 3.88 earned run average in that period. =Mets and Padres= Lolich was traded with Billy Baldwin to the New York Mets for Rusty Staub and Bill Laxton on December 12, 1975. As a major leaguer for at least ten years with the last five on the same ballclub, he had initially exercised his right to veto, which he eventually lifted after his attorney and Mets administrators M. Donald Grant, Joe McDonald and Bob Scheffing convinced him that the transaction was financially beneficial and would not negatively affect his family.Durso Joseph. \\"Mets Trade Staub to Tigers for Lolich,\\" The New York Times, Saturday, December 13, 1975. Retrieved May 1, 2020 Lolich posted an 8‚Äì13 record with a respectable 3.22 ERA for the Mets in 1976 however, he had disagreements with the Mets pitching coach as well as the Mets trainer and retired after the season. He opened a doughnut shop in suburban Detroit and sat out the 1977 season. He returned to baseball in 1978, signing with the San Diego Padres as a free agent. He played mostly as a relief pitcher for the Padres in 1978, going 2‚Äì1 with a 1.56 ERA in 20 games. The following season, Lolich added a knuckleball to his pitching. Lolich had an inconsistent season in 1979 and decided to retire. He pitched in his final major league game on September 23, 1979 at the age of 39. Career statistics In a 16-year major league career, Lolich played in 586 games, accumulating a 217‚Äì191 win‚Äìloss record along with a 3.44 earned run average. He struck out 200 or more batters in a season seven times in his career. His 2,832 career strikeouts were the most by a left-handed pitcher in Major League Baseball history until he was surpassed by Steve Carlton in 1981 and, he held the American League record for strikeouts by a left-handed pitcher until being surpassed by CC Sabathia in 2017. His 2,832 strikeouts ranks 20th all-time and fourth among left-handed pitchers behind Randy Johnson, Carlton and Sabathia. Lolich threw 41 shutouts and 195 complete games during his career, completing nearly 40 percent of his starts. He holds Detroit Tigers team records in single-season strikeouts (308), career strikeouts (2,679), shutouts (39), games started (459) and home runs allowed (329). In 1,017 plate appearances, he had 105 walks and 90 hits. He has the most career plate appearances of anyone with more walks than hits. Life after baseball In 1979, Lolich invested in a doughnut shop in Rochester, Michigan, with the understanding that his partner would run the business. Following disagreements, Lolich bought out his partner and began running the business. After losing his lease, he moved the doughnut business to Lake Orion in 1983. In the late 1990s, Lolich sold the doughnut shop and retired. He remained active in charity work and served as a coach at the Detroit Tigers' baseball fantasy camp in Lakeland, Florida. Because of his humble \\"everyman\\" qualities, many long-time Tiger fans celebrate him as one of the most popular sports figures in a working man's city. As The Detroit News put it, \\"He didn't act like a big shot superstar, he was one of us.\\"detnews.com  Michigan History In 2003, Lolich was one of 26 players chosen for the final ballot by the National Baseball Hall of Fame's Veterans Committee but garnered only 13 votes, far below the 75% required for election. A frequent claim of his is that never having won the Cy Young Award was a factor in his lack of success in Hall of Fame balloting (as of 2012). Lolich's other records and accomplishments *His 2,679 strikeouts is the second-most in AL history by a left-hander. *His 2,832 career strikeouts in both leagues ranked in the top 10 in major league history when he retired in 1979. *His 1,538 batters faced in 1971 was the most in the majors since George Uhle faced 1,548 in 1923.

For 55 seasons, 42 of them with the Detroit Tigers, Harwell called the action on radio and/or television. In January 2009, the American Sportscasters Association ranked Harwell 16th on its list of Top 50 Sportscasters of All Time.ASA's Top 50 Sportscasters of All Time Biography =Early life and career= Ernie Harwell grew up in Atlanta, Georgia, working in his youth as a paperboy for the Atlanta Georgian; one of his customers was writer Margaret Mitchell. An avid baseball fan from an early age, Harwell became visiting batboy for the Atlanta Crackers of the Southern Association at the age of five, and never had to buy a ticket to get into a baseball game again. At sixteen he began working as a regional correspondent for The Sporting News. Harwell attended Emory University, where he was a member of the Sigma Alpha Epsilon fraternity and helped edit The Emory Wheel. After graduating, Harwell worked as a copy editor and sportswriter for the Atlanta Constitution. In 1943, he began announcing games for the Crackers on WSB radio, after which he served four years in the United States Marine Corps. =Brooklyn Dodgers, New York Giants, and Baltimore Orioles= The Crackers were a Class AA team, two rungs below the majors. Nonetheless, Harwell had achieved considerable notoriety due to the Crackers airing their games on WSB, a 50,000-watt station that reached much of the eastern half of the United States at night. Brooklyn Dodgers general manager and part-owner Branch Rickey was impressed enough with Harwell that he believed he would be an appropriate substitute for longtime Dodgers announcer Red Barber, who was recuperating from a bleeding ulcer. He traded catcher Cliff Dapper to the Crackers in exchange for breaking Harwell's broadcasting contract, the only known instance in baseball history where a player was traded for a broadcaster. Harwell broadcast for the Dodgers through 1949, the New York Giants from 1950 to 1953, and the Baltimore Orioles from 1954 to 1959. Harwell was the lead broadcaster on Orioles broadcasts on WCBM-AM and WMAR-TV in 1955, working alongside Chuck Thompson. The next year Thompson moved on to Washington D.C. to broadcast the Senator games until returning to the Orioles in 1962. Early in Harwell's career, he also broadcast The Masters golf tournament, as well as pro and college football. =Detroit Tigers (1960-1991; 1993-2002)= Harwell joined the Tigers' broadcast crew in 1960, replacing Van Patrick. George Kell, who had begun calling Tigers games with Patrick the year before, and had previously played for the Orioles in 1956‚Äì57 while Harwell was announcing their games, was instrumental in bringing Harwell to Detroit. \\"George called and said, 'I recommended you and the Tigers asked me to get in touch with you.'\\" Harwell said. \\"I came and that was it.\\" Harwell shared TV and radio duties with Kell through 1963, then with Bob Scheffing in 1964. He began working radio exclusively in 1965, teaming with Gene Osborn for two seasons and then with Ray Lane from 1967 to 1972. In 1973, Paul Carey replaced Lane and joined Harwell to form the Tigers' best-known and longest-lasting radio team, which lasted until the end of the 1991 season. Harwell gained a large following outside of Detroit because the Tigers aired their games on WJR, a 50,000-watt station that reached most of the eastern half of North America at night. Harwell gets a prolonged standing ovation during his last game in Detroit during the 1991 season On December 19, 1990, the Tigers and WJR announced that the station wanted to go in a \\"new direction\\" and that the 1991 season would be Harwell's last, as his contract was \\"non-renewed\\".Detroit Free Press columnist Mitch Albom on non-renewal (\\"The Tigers Fired Ernie Harwell\\") (Carey then announced that he had already planned to retire after the 1991 season, and that the decision was unrelated to Harwell's contract situation.) Fans across Michigan and throughout the baseball world were outraged, but the ballclub and the radio station (who eventually wound up blaming each other for the decision) stood firm: \\"[Harwell's situation is] not going to change no matter how much clamor is made over it,\\" said team president Bo Schembechler. The situation caused outrage so much that some made threats of violence against Schembechler. Some, such as Mitch Albom, blamed the situation causing as much negative feeling as it did on WJR executive Jim Long who was the one who pushed the quick, no severance pay removal of Harwell.Free Press article about Harwell outster The movement in favor of keeping Harwell was so strong that even billboards in favor of his remaining were put up.New York Times obituary for Harwell Rick Rizzs was hired away from the Seattle Mariners to replace Harwell in 1992, teaming with Bob Rathbun. Harwell worked a part-time schedule for the California Angels in 1992. The following year, the Tigers were purchased by Mike Ilitch, who made it one of his first priorities to bring Harwell back. In 1993 Harwell teamed with Rizzs and Rathbun on the WJR broadcasts, calling play-by-play of the middle innings in each game. From 1994 to 1998, Harwell called television broadcasts for the Tigers on PASS Sports and later WKBD-TV. In 1999, he resumed full-time radio duties with the team, swapping roles with Frank Beckmann (who had replaced Rizzs in the radio booth following the 1994 season), teaming with analyst Jim Price, and continuing in that role even as the team's radio rights changed from WJR to WXYT in 2001. During spring training in 2002, Harwell announced that he would retire at the end of the season; his final broadcast came on September 29, 2002. Dan Dickerson, who had joined Harwell and Price in 2000, took over as the Tigers' lead radio voice. =National broadcast work= Harwell's broadcast for the Giants of the third and final game of the 1951 National League tie-breaker series against the Dodgers, which ended with the pennant-clinching \\"Shot Heard 'Round the World\\" home run by the Giants' Bobby Thompson, was carried nationally on NBC television. Harwell helped broadcast two All-Star Games (, ) and two World Series (1963, 1968) for NBC Radio, numerous ALCS and ALDS for CBS Radio and ESPN Radio, and the CBS Radio Game of the Week from 1992 to 1997. He also called the 1984 World Series locally for the Tigers and WJR. =Post-retirement broadcasting works= Following his retirement, Harwell came back briefly in 2003 to call a Wednesday Night Baseball telecast on ESPN, as part of that network's \\"Living Legends\\" series of guest announcers.http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/story?id=1591168 In 2005, Harwell guested for an inning on the Fox network's coverage of the All-Star Game (which was held in Detroit for the first time since 1971), as well as an inning on the ESPN Radio broadcast. For Game 3 of the 2006 American League Division Series between the Tigers and New York Yankees, he provided guest commentary on ESPN's telecast for two innings, called an inning of play-by- play on the Tigers' radio flagship WXYT, and guested for an inning on ESPN Radio. Harwell also called an inning of Game 1 of the 2006 World Series for WXYT. Harwell served as a guest color commentator for two Tiger games on FSN Detroit on May 24 and 25, 2007. Harwell worked the telecasts (alongside play- by-play man Mario Impemba) as a substitute for regular analyst Rod Allen, who took the games off to attend his son's high school graduation. (Harwell had filled in for Allen once before, on a 2003 telecast.) He also appeared as a guest on an ESPN Sunday Night Baseball telecast in Detroit on July 1, 2007. Harwell occasionally did vignettes on the history of baseball for Fox Sports Detroit's magazine program Tigers Weekly. Broadcasting style Harwell was known for his low-key delivery, southern accent (Detroit \\"Ti-guhs\\"), and conversational style. Some of his trademark phrases were: * \\"That one is long gone!\\" (His trademark home run call, with an emphasis on \\"long\\") * \\"He stood there like the house by the side of the road, and watched it go by.\\" (After a called strikeout) * \\"Called out for excessive window shopping.\\" (Also after a called strikeout) * \\"It's two for the price of one!\\" (After a double play) * \\"A fan from [insert a city] will be taking that ball home today.\\" (When a fan would catch a foul ball) * \\"The Tigers need instant runs.\\" (When the team was behind in the late innings) Harwell would also begin the first spring training broadcast of each season with a reading from Song of Solomon 2:11-12 (KJV): \\"For lo, the winter is past, the rain is over and gone; the flowers appear on the earth; the time of the singing of birds is come, and the voice of the turtle is heard in our land.\\"A 1993 rendition of Harwell's Song of Solomon reading can be heard at \\"Listen to Ernie Harwell's 'The Voice of the Turtle,'\\", Detroit Free Press sports blog, posted 25 February 2009. Non- broadcast activities Harwell's 1955 essay \\"The Game for All America\\", originally published in The Sporting News and reprinted numerous times, is considered a classic of baseball literature. He also authored several books, including Life After Baseball, Tuned to Baseball, and Breaking 90: Nine Decades Young and Still Loving Baseball.Detroit Free Press article on occasion of Harwell's 100th birthday He was an occasional columnist for the Detroit Free Press. Harwell also wrote popular music. His first recorded song was \\"Upside Down\\" on the Something Stupid album by Homer and Jethro in the mid-1960s. In the liner notes of the album, it says: \\"Detroit Tiger baseball announcer wrote this one, and we think it's a fine observation of the world today, as seen from the press box at Tiger Stadium. We were up there with Ernie one day and from there the world looks upside down. In fact, the Mets were on top in the National League.\\" All told, 66 songs written by Ernie Harwell have been recorded by various artists. \\"Needless to say, I have more no-hitters than Nolan Ryan.\\" ‚Äì Ernie Harwell in article published May 31, 2005, in the Detroit Free Press Harwell made a cameo appearance in the 1994 film Cobb and in the made-for-television movies Aunt Mary (1979), Tiger Town (1983), and Cooperstown (1993). His voice can be briefly heard in the films Paper Lion (1968) and One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest (1975) and in the TV movie The Five People You Meet in Heaven (2004). Harwell appeared as an interview subject in the 1998 documentary film The Life and Times of Hank Greenberg and contributed to numerous other baseball-themed documentaries and retrospectives over the years. The 1997 text-based computer simulation game APBA for Windows: Broadcast Blast features play-by-play commentary by Harwell. Harwell served as a spokesman for Blue Cross-Blue Shield of Michigan. His contract with the organization, which began in 2003, ran for ten years with an option for another ten. Had Harwell fulfilled the entire contract (by which time he would have been 95 years old), Blue Cross had pledged to extend it for yet another decade. Harwell formerly ran a blog about healthy living and fitness for BCBS. He retired from it on March 5, 2009. A devout Christian (he was born again at a 1961 Billy Graham crusade), Harwell was long involved with Baseball Chapel, an evangelistic organization for professional ballplayers. In 2004, the Detroit Public Library dedicated a room to Ernie Harwell and his wife, Lulu, which will house Harwell's collection of baseball memorabilia valued at over two million dollars. On April 26, 2008, Harwell was presented with an Honorary Doctorate of Humane Letters from The University of Michigan at their Spring Commencement ceremony. One week later, on May 3, 2008, he was presented with another Honorary Degree of Laws this time from Wayne State University. In late 2008, Harwell began to appear in television public service announcements for the Michigan Association of Broadcasters, advising viewers about the Digital television transition in the United States. Harwell was a member of the Old Tiger Stadium Conservancy Board, an organization which attempted to save portions of Tiger Stadium. He offered to donate a large portion of his historic collection of baseball memorabilia, which he had collected over the course of his storied career, if part of Tiger Stadium could have been saved for a museum. Harwell lived in Farmington Hills, Michigan, and moved to Novi in the late 1990s, where he lived until his death. Up until just before his death, he still exercised regularly, did sit-ups, used a treadmill, and lifted weights. Awards and honors Harwell in 2006.

Sherman and Richard M. Sherman at the London Palladium in 2002 during the premiere of Chitty Chitty Bang Bang: The Stage Musical. The Sherman Brothers were an American songwriting duo that specialized in musical films, made up of Robert B. Sherman (December 19, 1925 ‚Äì March 6, 2012) and Richard M. Sherman (born June 12, 1928). The Sherman Brothers wrote more motion- picture musical song scores than any other songwriting team in film history.London Today on air interview with Robert B. Sherman, April 17, 2002 Film scores of the Sherman Brothers include Mary Poppins, Chitty Chitty Bang Bang, The Jungle Book (except ‚ÄúThe Bare Necessities,‚Äù which Terry Gilkyson wrote), Bedknobs and Broomsticks, The Happiest Millionaire, Charlotte's Web and The Aristocats. Their most well known work, however, remains the theme park song There's A Great Big Beautiful Tomorrow and \\"It's A Small World After All.\\" According to Time.com, the latter song is the most performed song of all time. Life and work Sons of Russian-Jewish immigrants, Robert and Richard Sherman began writing songs together in 1951 on a challenge from their father, Tin Pan Alley songwriter Al Sherman. The brothers wrote together and with different songwriting partners throughout the rest of the decade. In 1958, Robert founded the music publishing company Music World Corporation, which later enjoyed a landmark relationship with Disney's BMI-affiliated publishing arm, Wonderland Music Company. That same year, the Sherman Brothers had their first top-ten hit with \\"Tall Paul\\", sung by Mouseketeer Judy Harriet on the Surf Records label and then covered by Mouseketeer Annette Funicello. They wrote the international hit \\"You're Sixteen\\", first recorded in 1960 by rockabilly singer Johnny Burnette, and a chart success again in 1973 for Ringo Starr. Seth Rogovoy, \\"The Secret Jewish History of ‚ÄòYou‚Äôre Sixteen...\\", Forward.com, November 27, 2017. Retrieved 30 April 2019 They also wrote the title song for Doris Day's album Bright and Shiny, recorded in 1960 and released a year later. The success of these songs gained the attention of Walt Disney, who eventually hired the Sherman Brothers as staff songwriters for Walt Disney Studios. The first song they wrote on personal assignment by Walt Disney was \\"Strummin' Song\\" in 1961. It was used in the Annette Funicello made-for-television movie called The Horsemasters. The first song that the Sherman Brothers contributed to a Disney movie was \\"Medfield Fight Song\\" from the film The Absent-Minded Professor (1961). While at Disney, the Sherman Brothers wrote more motion-picture musical scores than any other songwriters in the history of film. They also wrote what is perhaps their best-known song, \\"It's a Small World (After All)\\", for the 1964 New York World's Fair. Since then, some have claimed that this has become the most translated and performed song on Earth, although this is largely due to the fact that it is played continuously at Disney's theme park \\"It's a Small World\\" attractions of the same name. In 1965, the Sherman Brothers won two Academy Awards for Mary Poppins, which includes the songs \\"Feed The Birds,\\" \\"Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious,\\" and the Oscar-winning \\"Chim Chim Cher- ee.\\" Since Mary Poppins' premiere, the Shermans have subsequently earned nine Academy Award nominations, two Grammy Awards, four Grammy Award nominations, and 23 gold- and platinum-certified albums. Robert and Richard Sherman worked directly for Walt Disney, completing the scores for the live-action musical films The Happiest Millionaire and The One and Only, Genuine, Original Family Band until Disney's death in 1966. Since leaving the company, the brothers have worked freelance as songwriters on scores of motion pictures, television shows, theme-park exhibits, and stage musicals. Their first non-Disney assignment came with Albert R. Broccoli's motion picture production Chitty Chitty Bang Bang for United Artists in 1968, which garnered the brothers their third Academy Award nomination for Best Original Song for its particularly memorable titular song. In 1970, the Shermans returned to Disney for a brief stint where they completed work on The Aristocats and Bedknobs and Broomsticks. The latter film garnered the brothers their fourth and fifth Oscar nominations. 1972 saw the release of Snoopy Come Home, for which the brothers received a Grammy nomination. In 1973, the Sherman Brothers also made history by becoming the only Americans ever to win First Prize at the Moscow Film Festival for Tom Sawyer, for which they also authored the screenplay. In 1976, The Slipper and the Rose was picked to be the Royal Command Performance of the year. The performance was attended by Queen Elizabeth, the Queen Mother. A modern musical adaptation of the classic Cinderella story, Slipper also featured songs, score, and screenplay by the Sherman Brothers. Two further Academy Award nominations were garnered by the brothers for the film. That same year the Sherman Brothers received their star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame directly across from Grauman's Chinese Theatre. The Sherman Brothers' numerous other Disney and non-Disney top box office film credits include The Jungle Book (1967), The Aristocats (1970), The Parent Trap (1961), The Parent Trap (1998), Charlotte's Web (1973), Huckleberry Finn (1974), The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh (1977), Snoopy, Come Home (1972), Bedknobs and Broomsticks (1971), and Little Nemo: Adventures in Slumberland (1989). Outside the motion-picture realm, their Tony Award-nominated smash hit Over Here! (1974) was the biggest-grossing original Broadway musical of that year and broke box-office records for its Off-Broadway revival (2019). The Sherman Brothers have also written numerous top-selling songs including \\"You're Sixteen,\\" which reached Billboard's Hot 100 top 10 twice: first with Johnny Burnette in 1960 and then at #1 with Ringo Starr more than thirteen years later. Other top-ten hits include \\"Pineapple Princess,\\" \\"Let's Get Together,\\" and more. In 2000, the Sherman Brothers wrote the song score for the Disney film The Tigger Movie. This film marked the brothers' first major motion picture for the Disney company in over 28 years. In 2002, Chitty hit the London stage, receiving rave reviews. Chitty Chitty Bang Bang is currently the most successful stage show ever produced at the London Palladium, boasting the longest run in that century-old theater's history. On April 28, 2005, a second Chitty company premiered on Broadway (New York City) at the Foxwoods Theatre. The Sherman Brothers wrote an additional six songs specifically for the new stage productions. In 2003, four Sherman Brothers' musicals ranked in the Top 10 Favorite Children's Films of All Time in a British nationwide poll reported by the BBC. Most notably, Chitty Chitty Bang Bang (1968) topped the list at #1. In later years, with Robert's move to London, the brothers wrote new songs for the stage musical presentation of Chitty Chitty Bang Bang. For their contributions to the motion picture industry, the Sherman brothers have a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 6918 Hollywood Blvd. and were inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame on June 9, 2005. On November 16, 2006, Mary Poppins premiered at the New Amsterdam Theatre on Broadway. On November 17, 2008 the Sherman Brothers received the National Medal of Arts which is the highest honor conferred upon artists or patrons of the arts by the United States Government. The award was presented by United States President George W. Bush in an East Room ceremony at The White House. On May 22, 2009, The Boys: The Sherman Brothers' Story, a critically acclaimed documentary film about the pair, was theatrically released. The film was directed and produced by their sons, Gregory V. Sherman and Jeff Sherman, and distributed by Walt Disney Pictures. In October 2009, Disney released a 59-track, two-CD compendium of their work for the studio spanning 42 years. The CD is titled The Sherman Brothers Songbook. On March 11, 2010, the Sherman Brothers were presented with a specialized window on Main Street, U.S.A. Disneyland in Anaheim, California, in honor of their contribution to Disney theme parks. On May 17, 2010, the Sherman Brothers received the \\"Career Achievement Award\\" at The Theatre Museum's 2010 Awards Gala in New York City.

It was nominated for a 2003 Laurence Olivier Theatre Award for Best New Musical. The Sherman Brothers each received the Musical Theatre Award from the Variety Club of Great Britain that year as well for Chitty, which finished a record breaking three-and-a-half-year run at the Palladium, becoming the longest running show in the theater's century long history. In 2004, the premiere of Mary Poppins arrived on the stage. In 2005, Poppins was nominated for nine Olivier Awards. In 2005, Chitty went to Broadway and was nominated for nine Tonys and also began its nationwide (UK) tour. * On June 9, 2005, both Shermans were inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame alongside Bill Withers, Steve Cropper, John Fogerty, Isaac Hayes, and David Porter. * On November 16, 2006, the Cameron Mackintosh/Disney production of Mary Poppins made its Broadway premiere at the New Amsterdam Theater featuring the Sherman Brothers‚Äô classic songs. * In 2007, during the 40th- anniversary DVD rerelease of The Jungle Book London press junket, the Sherman Brothers were witnessed by press working on a new song for Inkas (see below) in the same Brown's Hotel room where The Jungle Book was originally penned by British writer Rudyard Kipling over a hundred years earlier. * In February 2008, Chitty Chitty Bang Bang began a second UK tour. In 2008 and 2009, Poppins premiered in numerous cities throughout the world including Stockholm, Copenhagen, Budapest, Toronto, Shanghai, Sydney, Johannesburg, Amsterdam, Buenos Aires, S√£o Paulo, and Helsinki. Full UK and US tours of Poppins also commenced in 2008, 2009 and 2010 respectively. * On May 21, 2011, the Sherman Brothers were each awarded honorary doctorate degrees in Fine Arts from their alma mater, Bard College. This was Robert's second honorary doctorate. His first was granted by Lincoln College on May 12, 1990. Robert's critically acclaimed autobiography, Moose: Chapters From My Life was published posthumously by AuthorHouse Publishers on November 27, 2013 in anticipation of the release of the Walt Disney Pictures film Saving Mr. Banks. Set in 1961 and based on the stories behind the original development meetings for Disney's film version of Mary Poppins, Saving Mr. Banks features actors BJ Novak as Robert Sherman and Jason Schwartzman as Richard Sherman. * In 2014 the Sherman Brothers, alongside their father, Al Sherman were the subjects of a London musical concert entitled, A Spoonful of Sherman written, produced and hosted by Robert's son, Robert J. Sherman. The concert received generally very positive reviews including four stars from the London Times.

The theory states that a leader's behavior is contingent to the satisfaction, motivation and performance of his or her subordinates. The revised version also argues that the leader engages in behaviors that complement subordinate's abilities and compensate for deficiencies. According to Robert House and John Antonakis, the task-oriented elements of the path‚Äìgoal model can be classified as a form of instrumental leadership. Origins The first theory was inspired by the work of Martin G. Evans (1970), in which the leadership behaviors and the follower perceptions of the degree to which following a particular behavior (path) will lead to a particular outcome (goal). The path‚Äìgoal theory was also influenced by the expectancy theory of motivation developed by Victor Vroom in 1964. Vroom built his work on the work of Georgopoulos et al. (1957): A path-goal approach to productivity. Journal of Applied Psychology. Volume 41, No. 6, pages 345‚Äì353. Original theory According to the first of all theory, the manager's job is viewed as guiding workers to choose the best paths to reach their goals, as well as the organizational goals. The theory argues that leaders will have to engage in different types of leadership behavior depending on the nature and the demands of a particular situation. It is the leader's job to assist followers in attaining goals and to provide the direction and support needed to ensure that their goals are compatible with the organization's goals. A leader's behavior is acceptable to subordinates when viewed as a source of satisfaction, and motivational when need satisfaction is contingent on performance, and the leader facilitates, coaches, and rewards effective performance. The original path-goal theory identifies achievement-oriented, directive, participative, and supportive leader behaviors: * The directive path-goal clarifying leader behavior refers to situations where the leader lets followers know what is expected of them and tells them how to perform their tasks. The theory argues that this behavior has the most positive effect when the subordinates' role and task demands are ambiguous and intrinsically satisfying. * The achievement-oriented leader behavior refers to situations where the leader sets challenging goals for followers, expects them to perform at their highest level, and shows confidence in their ability to meet this expectation. Occupations in which the achievement motive were most predominant were technical jobs, sales persons, scientists, engineers, and entrepreneurs. * The participative leader behavior involves leaders consulting with followers and asking for their suggestions before making a decision. This behavior is predominant when subordinates are highly personally involved in their work. * The supportive leader behavior is directed towards the satisfaction of subordinates needs and preferences. The leader shows concern for the followers' psychological well being. This behavior is especially needed in situations in which tasks or relationships are psychologically or physically distressing. Path‚Äìgoal theory assumes that leaders are flexible and that they can change their style, as situations require. The theory proposes two contingency variables, such as environment and follower characteristics, that moderate the leader behavior-outcome relationship. Environment is outside the control of the follower-task structure, authority system, and work group. Environmental factors determine the type of leader behavior required if the follower outcomes are to be maximized. Follower characteristics are the locus of control, experience, and perceived ability. Personal characteristics of subordinates determine how the environment and leader are interpreted. Effective leaders clarify the path to help their followers achieve goals and make the journey easier by reducing roadblocks and pitfalls. \\"The basic idea behind path-goal theory.\\" University of Maryland. 2009-04-27. URL: http://terpconnect.umd.edu/~dbalon/EDCP317/notes/Path-Goal_Theory.pdf. Accessed: 2009-04-27. (Archived by WebCite at https://www.webcitation.org/5gLBry5Zs) Research demonstrates that employee performance and satisfaction are positively influenced when the leader compensates for the shortcomings in either the employee or the work setting. According to Northouse, the theory is useful because it reminds leaders that their central purpose as a leader is to help subordinates define and reach their goals in an efficient manner. In college athletics House (1971) refers to Rizzo (1970), stating that a leader initiating structure increases the path instrumentality for subordinates by decreasing role ambiguity. Also, he says that a leader who is initiating structure and consideration will have different effects depending on whether the task is satisfying or unsatisfying to the subordinate and whether the task-role demands are clear or ambiguous. This means that the more satisfying the task, the less positive the relationship is between consideration and subordinate satisfaction and performance ‚Äì meaning people tend to act and enjoy it without considering whether they should not. Also, it means that when a coach is clear in setting goals and expectations, the goals are more likely to be achieved than if the goals and expectations are unclear. This is good for coaches, it means that when they can present a goal that is most satisfying to athletes, it is more likely for the athletes to have affective desire for achieving the goal. For a college coach, practicing good ethics in this regard means creating goals that are within reach for a team, and working together with members of a team when creating these goals. Larson and LaFasto in their 1989 book \\"TeamWork\\" place a clear & elevating goal at the forefront of the necessary components for a successful team. \\"The image of a desired state of affairs that inspires action\\" is how Garfield defines a clear goal, according to the authors (p. 27). They say that when the goal is \\"unfocused and \\"politicized\\", it becomes a reason for ineffective team functioning. \\"A sense of mission\\" is a clear characteristic of peak performers', says Garfield, according to the authors. Larson and LaFasto make no mistake in emphasizing the importance of clarity. \\"Elevating\\" to the authors means \\"personally challenging\\" (p. 31). A player asks the personal question of how worthwhile the goal itself is, and what type of difference it makes. The elevating factor of goal setting brings about a sense of urgency, causes a team to lose track of time (relates to the idea of \\"flow\\" in the field of positive psychology), and causes the rate of communication to increase, for example, players calling one another in the evening, outside the sport context, to talk about today's practice or tomorrow's game.

In the United States, foils are commonly measured in thousandths of an inch or mils. Standard household foil is typically thick, and heavy duty household foil is typically . The foil is pliable, and can be readily bent or wrapped around objects. Thin foils are fragile and are sometimes laminated with other materials such as plastics or paper to make them stronger and more useful. Aluminium foil supplanted tin foil in the mid 20th century. Annual production of aluminium foil was approximately in Europe and in the U.S. in 2003.\\"Foil & Packaging\\". . The Aluminum Association (USA). Approximately 75% of aluminium foil is used for packaging of foods, cosmetics, and chemical products, and 25% is used for industrial applications (e.g., thermal insulation, electrical cables, and electronics). It can be easily recycled. In North America aluminium foil was popularised by Reynolds Metals, the leading manufacturer in North America. In the United Kingdom and United States it is, informally, widely called tin foil, for historical reasons (similar to how steel cans are often still called \\"tin cans\\"). Metallised films are sometimes mistaken for aluminium foil, but are actually polymer films coated with a thin layer of aluminium. In Australia, aluminium foil is widely called alfoil.  History  =Before aluminium foil= Foil made from a thin leaf of tin was commercially available before its aluminium counterpart. Tin foil was marketed commercially from the late nineteenth into the early twentieth century. The term \\"tin foil\\" survives in the English language as a term for the newer aluminium foil. Tin foil is less malleable than aluminium foil and tends to give a slight tin taste to food wrapped in it. Tin foil has been supplanted by aluminium and other materials for wrapping food. The first audio recordings on phonograph cylinders were made on tin foil. =The first aluminium foil= Tin was first replaced by aluminium in 1910, when the first aluminium foil rolling plant, \\"Dr. Lauber, Neher & Cie.\\" was opened in Emmishofen, Switzerland. The plant, owned by J.G. Neher & Sons, the aluminium manufacturers, started in 1886 in Schaffhausen, Switzerland, at the foot of the Rhine Falls, capturing the falls' energy to process aluminium. Neher's sons, together with Dr. Lauber, discovered the endless rolling process and the use of aluminium foil as a protective barrier in December 1907. In 1911, Bern-based Tobler began wrapping its chocolate bars in aluminium foil, including the unique triangular chocolate bar, Toblerone. By 1912, aluminium foil was being used by Maggi (today a Nestl√© brand) to pack soups and stock cubes. The first use of foil in the United States was in 1913 for wrapping Life Savers, candy bars, and gum.Hanlon, J. (1992). 1st ed. Handbook of Package Engineering, Lancaster, Pennsylvania, and Technomic Publishing: . Chapter 3 Films and Foils. Processes evolved over time to include the use of print, colour, lacquer, laminate and the embossing of the aluminium.  Manufacture  A roll of aluminium foil, with micrometer showing a thickness of Aluminium foil is produced by rolling sheet ingots cast from molten billet aluminium, then re-rolling on sheet and foil rolling mills to the desired thickness, or by continuously casting and cold rolling. To maintain a constant thickness in aluminium foil production, beta radiation is passed through the foil to a sensor on the other side. If the intensity becomes too high, then the rollers adjust, increasing the thickness. If the intensities become too low and the foil has become too thick, the rollers apply more pressure, causing the foil to be made thinner. The continuous casting method is much less energy intensive and has become the preferred process.Robertson, G. (2006). 2nd ed. Food Packaging, Principles and Practise, Boca Raton, FL, Taylor & Francis Group: . Chapter 7 Metal Packaging Materials. For thicknesses below , two layers are usually put together for the final pass and afterwards separated which produces foil with one bright side and one matte side. The two sides in contact with each other are matte and the exterior sides become bright; this is done to reduce tearing, increase production rates, control thickness, and get around the need for a smaller diameter roller. Some lubrication is needed during the rolling stages; otherwise, the foil surface can become marked with a herringbone pattern. These lubricants are sprayed on the foil surface before passing through the mill rolls. Kerosene based lubricants are commonly used, although oils approved for food contact must be used for foil intended for food packaging. Aluminium becomes work hardened during the cold rolling process and is annealed for most purposes. The rolls of foil are heated until the degree of softness is reached, which may be up to for 12 hours. During this heating, the lubricating oils are burned off, leaving a dry surface. Lubricant oils may not be completely burnt off for hard temper rolls, which can make subsequent coating or printing more difficult. The rolls of aluminium foil are then slit on slitter rewinding machines into smaller rolls. Roll slitting and rewinding is an essential part of the finishing process.  Properties  Microscopic close-up of aluminium foil on the back of an intumescent rubber strip. Aluminium foils thicker than are impermeable to oxygen and water. Foils thinner than this become slightly permeable due to minute pinholes caused by the production process. Aluminium foil has a shiny side and a matte side. The shiny side is produced when the aluminium is rolled during the final pass. It is difficult to produce rollers with a gap fine enough to cope with the foil gauge, therefore, for the final pass, two sheets are rolled at the same time, doubling the thickness of the gauge at entry to the rollers. When the sheets are later separated, the inside surface is dull, and the outside surface is shiny. This difference in the finish has led to the perception that favouring a side has an effect when cooking. While many believe (wrongly) that the different properties keep heat out when wrapped with the shiny finish facing out, and keep heat in with the shiny finish facing inwards, the actual difference is imperceptible without instrumentation. Increased reflectivity decreases both absorption and emission of radiation. Foil may have a non-stick coating on only one side. The reflectivity of bright aluminium foil is 88% while dull embossed foil is about 80%. Uses = Packaging = Chocolates in aluminium foil packaging Aluminium is used for packaging as it is highly malleable: it can be easily converted to thin sheets and folded, rolled or packed. Aluminium foil acts as a total barrier to light and oxygen (which cause fats to oxidise or become rancid), odours and flavours, moistness, and germs, and so it is used broadly in food and pharmaceutical packaging, including long-life packs (aseptic packaging) for drinks and dairy goods, which allows storing without refrigeration. Aluminium foil containers and trays are used to bake pies and to pack takeaway meals, ready snacks and long life pet foods. Aluminium foil is widely sold into the consumer market, often in rolls of width and several metres in length.Examples of products It is used for wrapping food in order to preserve it, for example, when storing leftover food in a refrigerator (where it serves the additional purpose of preventing odour exchange), when taking sandwiches on a journey, when baking, or when selling some kinds of take-away or fast food. Tex-Mex restaurants in the United States, for example, typically provide take-away burritos wrapped in aluminium foil. = Insulation = Aluminium foil is widely used for radiation shield (barrier and reflectivity), heat exchangers (heat conduction) and cable liners (barrier and electrical conductivity). Aluminium foil's heat conductive qualities make it a common accessory in hookah smoking: a sheet of perforated aluminium foil is frequently placed between the coal and the tobacco, allowing the tobacco to be heated without coming into direct contact with the burning coal. = Electromagnetic shielding = The shielding effectiveness of aluminium foil depends upon the type of incident field (electric, magnetic, or plane wave), the thickness of the foil, and the frequency (which determines the skin depth). Shielding effectiveness is usually broken down into a reflection loss (the energy bounces off the shield rather than penetrates it) and an absorption loss (the energy is dissipated within the shield). Although aluminium is non-magnetic, it is a good conductor, so even a thin sheet reflects almost all of an incident electric wave. At frequencies more than 100 MHz, the transmitted electric field is attenuated by more than 80 decibels (dB) (less than 10‚àí8 = 0.00000001 of the power gets through) . graphs reflection loss for copper, and shows electric field and plane wave losses at greater than 90 dB.‚Äîhowever actual energy absorption is minimal: the remaining high-frequency rf energy is almost perfectly reflected from uniform flat aluminium surface, and thus, reflected signal may continue to propagate internally, and if holes or passages of suitable geometry exist in the shield, signal propagation may continue out through those, the aluminium being good material for implementation of a microwave-frequency waveguide. Thin sheets of aluminium are not very effective at attenuating low-frequency magnetic fields. The shielding effectiveness is dependent upon the skin depth. A field travelling through one skin depth will lose about 63 per cent of its energy (it is attenuated to 1/e = 1/2.718... of its original energy). Thin shields also have internal reflections that reduce the shielding effectiveness. For effective shielding from a magnetic field, the shield should be several skin depths thick. Aluminium foil is about ; a thickness of (ten times thicker) offers less than 1 dB of shielding at 1 kHz, about 8 dB at 10 kHz, and about 25 dB at 100 kHz. At these frequencies a ferromagnetic material such as mild steel is much more effective, due to different and complementary electromagnetic permeability properties, and common practical shielding implementations utilise both an inner high- frequency reflective material such as aluminium, preferably bonded (via annealing or electroplating, done to avoid capacitance between separated layers), to a more substantial structural ferromagnetic shell, usually mild steel (in specialized applications, more expensive, less structurally useful and less workable materials may be preferred.) Despite the relative low mass density of aluminium, this design is usually both lighter and more effective than an equivalently absorptive design utilizing aluminium alone (although with poorer heat dissipative properties, typically accommodated by improved ventilation, which itself needs careful consideration in order to preserve the desired shielding effectiveness). = Cooking = Aluminium foil is also used for barbecuing delicate foods, such as mushrooms and vegetables. Using this method, sometimes called a hobo pack, food is wrapped in foil, then placed on the grill, preventing loss of moisture that may result in a less appealing texture. As is the case with all metallic items, aluminium foil reacts to being placed in a microwave oven. This is because of the electromagnetic fields of the microwaves inducing electric currents in the foil and high potentials at the sharp points of the foil sheet; if the potential is sufficiently high, it will cause electric arcing to areas with lower potential, even to the air surrounding the sheet. Modern microwave ovens have been designed to prevent damage to the cavity magnetron tube from microwave energy reflection, and aluminium packages designed for microwave heating are available.Huss, G. (1997) Microwaveable Packaging and Dual-Ovenable Materials in The Wiley Encyclopedia of Packaging Technology, 2nd ed., edited by Brody, A. and Marsch, K. New York, John Wiley and Sons = Art and decoration = Heavier foils made of aluminium are used for art, decoration, and crafts, especially in bright metallic colours. Metallic aluminium, normally silvery in colour, can be made to take on other colours through anodisation. Anodising creates an oxide layer on the aluminium surface that can accept coloured dyes or metallic salts, depending on the process used. In this way, aluminium is used to create an inexpensive gold foil that actually contains no gold, and many other bright metallic colours. These foils are sometimes used in distinctive packaging. = Geochemical sampling = Foil is used by organic/petroleum geochemists for protecting rock samples taken from the fields and in the labs where the sample is subject to biomarker analysis. While plastic or cloth bags are normally used for a geological sampling exercise, cloth bags are permeable and may allow organic solvents or oils (such as oils imparted from the skin) to taint the sample, and traces of the plastics from plastic bags may also taint the sample. Foil provides a seal to the ingress of organic solvents and does not taint the sample. Foil is also used extensively in geochemical laboratories to provide a barrier for the geochemist, and for sample storage. = Ribbon microphones = The material used in many ribbon microphones is aluminium leaf, or \\"imitation silver leaf\\", as it is sometimes called. This is pure aluminium and is around 0.6 to 2.0 micrometres thick. It is virtually the same material that the BBC used on Coles ribbons, with the exception that they also hand beat the leaf even thinner. They did this by sandwiching the ribbon between toilet paper and beating with a ball-peen hammer. This \\"cold forges\\" the leaf. The aluminium leaf was then annealed for an hour in an oven to restore flexibility. Corrugations must also be imparted into the ribbon: Coles used 25 per inch (1 mm cycle). RCA 44BX has 19 corrugations per inch (0.7 mm cycle) and is around long; RCA 77 has 13 corrugations per inch (0.5 mm cycle). RCA ribbon material is around 1 to 1.5 micrometres (0.00005 inch) thick. The new Nady ribbon plus AEA both state that they use 2 micrometre aluminium ribbon in their microphones.  Environmental issues  Some aluminium foil products can be recycled at around 5% of the original energy cost, although many aluminium laminates are not recycled due to difficulties in separating the components and low yield of aluminium metal.

He both created and made popular Chimurenga music, and his slow-moving style and distinctive voice is instantly recognisable to Zimbabweans. Mapfumo was imprisoned without charges under the white-dominated regime of Rhodesia, and he was hounded by the Mugabe government of Zimbabwe that succeeded it. He lived in exile in the United States for two decades, and in April 2018, returned to Zimbabwe for the first time since 2005 to perform a concert. Biography Mapfumo was born in 1945 in Marondera, Mashonaland East, a town southeast of Harare, the capital of Zimbabwe, though at the time the capital was called Salisbury and the country was a colony of Great Britain called Southern Rhodesia (becoming Rhodesia in ordinary usage after Northern Rhodesia gained independence as Zambia). He lived a traditional, rural Shona lifestyle until the age of ten, when his family moved to the Harare township of Mbare. It was during these early years that he was exposed to the traditional music of the Shona, the influence of which would drive his later music to incorporate and/or reflect the sounds of the ngoma drum and the mbira, a metal-pronged instrument with spiritual importance.National Geographic World Music Bio Early career He joined his first band, the Zutu Brothers (Encyclop√¶dia Britannica says it was the Cyclones), as a singer at the age of 16. From then he was always in one band or another, such as The Wagon Wheels with legendary Afro jazz musician Oliver Mtukudzi and legendary guitarist James Chimombe sometimes doing odd jobs on the side as well, including chicken farming. Hence the name of his 1972 band, the Hallelujah Chicken Run Band. He played mostly covers of American rock and soul tunes, such as Otis Redding or Elvis Presley, until he was in the Hallelujah Chicken Run Band. There he introduced the innovation of adapting traditional Shona music to modern rock instrumentation. He worked with guitarist Joshua Dube (Leopard Man's Africa Music Guide says Jonah Sithole) to transcribe the sounds of the chief instrument of traditional Shona music, the mbira to the electric guitar. He also started singing primarily in the Shona language, rather than in English. Political undertones Simply drawing on the native musical tradition and singing in his native language was a political statement. Rhodesia was ruled by a minority of white individuals who derogated the native black population and culture. But more than that, his lyrics became overtly political, supporting the revolution that was developing in the rural areas, what Mapfumo calls \\"the communal lands\\". He called his new style of music Chimurenga. In Shona it means \\"a little flame\\", and was the name of a previous revolutionary movement in the late 19th century. His songs openly called for the violent overthrow of the government, with lyrics like \\"Mothers, send your sons to war.\\" Political overtones Mapfumo's music caught the attention of the Rhodesian government with his song \\"Hokoyo!\\", meaning \\"Watch out!\\" The government banned the record from the state- controlled radio and threw him into a prison camp without charges in 1979. They were unable to stop his records from being played in discos or on radio stations they did not control, including the Voice of Mozambique. Large demonstrations in protest of his arrest and an inability to find charges against him forced the government to release him after three months. Free elections were held in 1980, and a new government was installed. Mapfumo performed at a celebratory concert that also featured Bob Marley. In later years, he would come to criticize the same government he, in some ways, helped bring to power. The PRI-syndicated radio program Afropop Worldwide ran a feature on Thomas Mapfumo in late 1988/early 1989. Host Georges Collinet describes Mapfumo as living in the low-density suburbs with his wife, who worked at a law office in downtown Harare, and his two children‚Äîa boy and a girl. And he drove a blue Ford with fake leopard-skin seat covers. Most of his songs were still political, dealing with poverty and other social issues. Mapfumo comments on the fact that he doesn't sing many love songs: \\"All you need if you wanna get into the bedroom... You've got a wife. You do it. You don't have to sing a song about it.\\" Collinet also observes that Mapfumo can't sing anything he wants: \\"Clearly he can't sing 'Down with President Mugabe' ‚Äì but he wouldn't want to. He supports the present government.\\" However, that would soon change. Recorded at Shed Studios Harare, by engineer Benny Miller, Mapfumo released the album Corruption in 1989. It criticised Mugabe and his government, with which Mapfumo was becoming more and more disillusioned. Mugabe wasn't happy with Mapfumo, either, and Mapfumo became the target of government harassment. Mapfumo was accused of being involved with a stolen-car ring. Things got uncomfortable enough that Mapfumo moved to Eugene, Oregon in the late 1990s. After Mugabe's overthrow in 2017 he returned to Zimbabwe to a massive show named 'Homecoming Bira' at Glamis Arena in Harare on April 28, 2018. The homecoming show proved that Mafumo was out of political danger and he returned for more shows in many parts of Zimbabwe between December 2018 and March 2019. He returned to his United States base after the four-month visit to Zimbabwe. Thomas Mapfumo tours internationally, and still sings and speaks out about the problems of Zimbabwe. His Chimurenga style of music influenced other Zimbabwean musicians, including the Bhundu Boys and Stella Chiweshe. Discography * Shumba (1990, Earthworks) =Thomas Mapfumo and the Acid Band= *Hokoyo!

The closing locations were chosen based upon their overall performance, profitability, and proximity to competitors such as Best Buy, Fry's Electronics, Micro Center, and Circuit City. This first round of closings reduced the number of stores to less than half of its previous number. During the liquidation process, the stores typically offered discounts starting at 5 to 30 percent off of retail prices, ending at up to 95 percent. Liquidation was completed on May 14, 2007. On December 7, 2007, CompUSA was sold to Specialty Equity, an affiliate of Gordon Brothers Group. On January 6, 2008, a month after CompUSA was sold to liquidators, Systemax, Inc. (TigerDirect's then-parent company) announced its purchase of 16 CompUSA locations as well as the brand, trademarks, e-commerce business, and technical services. Systemax also had announced that the eleven existing and three TigerDirect-branded retail stores that were under construction would be converted to the CompUSA brand over the spring of 2008. On November 2, 2012, it was announced that Systemax would drop both the CompUSA and Circuit City storefront brands by consolidating their businesses under the TigerDirect brand and website. That officially marked the end of the heritage CompUSA brand name as used by Systemax. Customers of both businesses were informed via e-mail on November 7, 2012.

A person who makes or sells cutlery is called a cutler. The city of Sheffield in England has been famous for the production of cutlery since the 17th century and a train ‚Äì the Master Cutler ‚Äì running from Sheffield to London was named after the industry. Bringing affordable cutlery to the masses, stainless steel was developed in Sheffield in the early 20th century. Cutlery is more usually known as silverware or flatware in the United States, where cutlery usually means knives and related cutting instruments. Although the term silverware is used irrespective of the material composition of the utensils, the term tableware has come into use to avoid the implication that they are made of silver. The major items of cutlery in Western culture are the knife, fork and spoon. These three implements first appeared together on tables in Britain in the Georgian era. In recent times, hybrid versions of cutlery have been made combining the functionality of different eating implements, including the spork (spoon / fork), spife (spoon / knife), and knork (knife / fork) or the sporf which combines all three. Etymology The word cutler derives from the Middle English word 'cuteler' and this in turn derives from Old French 'coutelier' which comes from 'coutel'; meaning knife (modern French: couteau).The Sheffield Knife Book, Geoffrey Tweedale, The Hallamshire press, 1996, The word's early origins can be seen in the Latin word 'culter' (knife). Composition A set (known as a canteen) of Georgian era silver cutlery, including ladles, and serving spoons. The thin item on the left is a marrow scoop for eating Bone marrow = Metallic = Sterling silver is the traditional material from which good quality cutlery is made. Historically, silver had the advantage over other metals of being less chemically reactive. Chemical reactions between certain foods and the cutlery metal can lead to unpleasant tastes. Gold is even less reactive than silver, but the use of gold cutlery was confined to the exceptionally wealthy, such as monarchs. Steel was always used for more utilitarian knives, and pewter was used for some cheaper items, especially spoons. From the nineteenth century, electroplated nickel silver (EPNS) was used as a cheaper substitute for sterling silver. In 1913, the British metallurgist Harry Brearley discovered stainless steel by chance, bringing affordable cutlery to the masses. This metal has come to be the predominant one used in cutlery. An alternative is melchior, corrosion-resistant nickel and copper alloy, which can also sometimes contain manganese and nickel-iron. = Plastic = Plastic cutlery is made for disposable use, and is frequently used outdoors for camping, excursions, and barbecues for instance. Plastic cutlery is also commonly used at fast-food or take-away outlets and provided with airline meals in economy class. Plastic is also used for children's cutlery. It is often thicker and more durable than disposable plastic cutlery. = Wooden = Wooden disposable cutlery is available as a popular biodegradable alternative. Bamboo and maple wood are a few popular choice of wood. = Edible = Edible cutlery is made from dried grains. These are made primarily with rice, millets or wheat. Since rice cultivation needs a lot of water, manufacturers market millet based products as more environment friendly. The batter is baked in moulds which hardens it. Some manufacturers offer an option of flavoured cutlery. Edible cutlery decomposes in about a week if disposed. Industry A table setting for an eight-course meal. It includes a butter spreader resting on a crystal stand; a cocktail fork, soup spoon, dessert fork, dessert spoon and an ice cream fork, as well as separate knives and forks for fish, entr√©e, main course and salad At Sheffield the trade of cutler became divided, with allied trades such as razormaker, awlbladesmith, shearsmith and forkmaker emerging and becoming distinct trades by the 18th century. Before the mid 19th century when cheap mild steel became available due to new methods of steelmaking, knives (and other edged tools) were made by welding a strip of steel on to the piece of iron that was to be formed into a knife, or sandwiching a strip of steel between two pieces of iron. This was done because steel was then a much more expensive commodity than iron. Modern blades are sometimes laminated, but for a different reason. Since the hardest steel is brittle, a layer of hard steel may be laid between two layers of a milder, less brittle steel, for a blade that keeps a sharp edge well, and is less likely to break in service. After fabrication, the knife had to be sharpened, originally on a grindstone, but from the late medieval period in a blade mill or (as they were known in the Sheffield region) a cutlers wheel. = Disposable cutlery =  Plastic  Starch- polyester disposable cutlery Introduced for convenience purposes (lightweight, no cleanup after the meal required), disposable cutlery made of plastic has become a huge worldwide market. Along with other disposable tableware (paper plates, plastic table covers, disposable cups, paper napkins, etc.), these products have become essential for the fast food and catering industry. The products are emblematic of throw-away societies and the cause of millions of tons of non-biodegradable plastic waste. The European Union will be banning such plastic products from 2021 as part of the European Plastics Strategy.  Wooden  As an ecofriendly alternative to non-degradable plastic, wooden cutlery is gaining popularity. Some manufacturers coat their products in food-safe plant oils, waxes and lemon juice for a longer shelf life making these safe for human consumption. Cutlery is then cured for a few days before leaving the manufacturing plant.  Edible  Edible cutlery is gaining popularity as an eco-friendly alternative to non-decomposing plastic. Bakey's based in Hyderabad, India is a popular edible cutlery manufacturer established by a former scientist. At Bakey's millet based dough is poured into metallic moulds and baked at for about 28 minutes which hardens it.

He was also minister of foreign affairs from 11 March 1981 to 15 August 1981, while he was prime minister. He was assassinated in a bombing on 30 August 1981 along with prime minister Mohammad-Javad Bahonar. Early life and education Baharestan street, Tehran Mohammad-Ali Rajai was born on 15 June 1933 in Qazvin, Iran. His father, a shopkeeper named Abdulsamad, died when he was 4 years old. Rajai grew up in Qazvin and moved to Tehran in the late 1940s. He joined the Air Force at age sixteen or seventeen. In 1959 he graduated from Tarbiat Moallem University with a degree in education. He worked as a teacher of mathematics. Political career =Before the Islamic revolution= After moving to Tehran, Rajai became involved in the anti-Shah movement and was associated with Ayatollah Mahmoud Taleghani and the Fadaeian group. At one time a member of the largely anti- clerical People's Mujahedin of Iran (MKO), Rajai turned against its leftist orientation and in 1960 joined the Freedom Movement of Iran. He was arrested at least twice by the Shah's forces for his opposition activities and famously displayed his bare foot at the United Nations while describing being tortured by the Shah's interrogators. His longest detention extended from May 1974 to late 1978. =After the Islamic revolution= He was actively involved in the Iranian Revolution and was a leader in the movement to purge Iranian universities of American and European influences, which was later called the Cultural Revolution. Rajaei appointed to important occupations after the victory of Islamic revolution. The occupations were as follow: *As the minister of Ministry of Education (Iran) *As the candidate of Islamic Consultative Assembly *As the prime minister *As the president Ministry of Education Ahmad, and Ruhollah Khomeini At the beginning, Gholam Hosein Shokohi was the minister of education, and Rajaei was one of his chancellors. After Shokohi's resigning due to illness, Muhammad Ali Rajaei was appointed as the supervisor of the ministry of education. He was introduced by Muhammad Javad Bahonar, and he became the supervisor of education ministry from 18th shahrivar month to 7th mehr at 1357 solar. Finally, Mehdi Bazargan presented him as the minister of education in his cabinet. His programs in the ministry of education included fair distribution of facilities, fair distribution of finance among staffs, reforming of centers of educating teachers, creating a suitable pedagogical system for Muslim society, developing of Islamic ethics among teachers and pupils, creating a good relation between parents and teachers and respect to dignity of teachers according to Islam. These schedules were very important for Rajaei, and he tried to realize them. He was in charge of the ministry for nine months. The most important achievements were the consistency of all schools and also trying to do away with discrimination and differences. He also tried to change the contents of educational books and also made attempts of Islamization of their contents. =Appointment as Prime Minister= Rajai and Prime Minister Mohammad-Javad Bahonar In 1979, Rajai left the Freedom Movement. Following the Iranian Revolution, he was appointed minister of education in the government of Mehdi Bazargan, and although Bazargan's cabinet resigned on 6 November 1979, he did not resign and remained in the post until 12 August 1980 when he became prime minister. Following the presidency of Bani Sadr, after 5 months, he nominated Rajai for the position, and parliament voted him in. He appointed Khodapanahi as foreign minister, Mohammad-Reza Mahdavi Kani as interior minister and Javad Fakori as defence minister. During his prime ministership, the Iran‚ÄìIraq War started and his government's first policy became the \\"victory and defence\\". He was in office until 2 August 1981 when he became the second president of Iran. =Presidency= Bani Sadr was impeached on 22 June 1981 by parliament, and Khomeini held a Provisional Presidential Council by 6 people headed by Mohammad Beheshti and later Abdul-Karim Mousavi Ardebili. Rajai was one of the members of that Council. He nominated himself for the presidential election in 1981. He was the first president from the Islamic Republican Party after winning 91% of the votes. He officially became the president after the Oath of Office on 2 August 1981.\\"Rajai Sworn In; Bani-Sadr Predicts Revolt\\", Pittsburgh Press, 2 August 1981, p. A-8 He named Mohammad-Javad Bahonar to the Parliament to become the next prime minister. Parliament voted in to Bahonar and he formed a new government. =Assassination= On 30 August 1981, President Rajai held a meeting of Iran's Supreme Defence Council, along with the Prime Minister Mohammad Javad Bahonar. Witnesses later stated that a trusted aide brought a briefcase into the conference room, set it between the two leaders, and then left. Another person opened the case, triggering a bomb that set the room ablaze and killed Rajai, Bahonar, and three others.Facts on File Yearbook 1981 This attack occurred two months after the Hafte Tir bombing. The assassin was identified as Massoud Keshmiri, an operative of the People's Mujahedin of Iran (also known as the MKO, MEK and PMOI), who had infiltrated the Prime Minister's office in the guise of a state security official. Rajai was buried in Behesht-e Zahra. Political positions Rajai's political programs were based on a form of constitutional law that included a position of privilege for Islam. He insisted that those in control of the state must be Muslim, emphasized the Velayat-e Faqih, and believed it essential that the government cooperate with institutions such as the Islamic Revolutionary Guard and Islamic Revolutionary Court. He respected people's freedom insofar as it did not contravene Islamic law and tried during his tenure to create a consistent government.

In 1906, Kirilenko was born at Alexeyevka in Belgorod Oblast to a Ukrainian working-class family. He graduated in the 1920s from a local vocational school, and again in the mid-to-late 1930s from the Rybinsk Aviation Technology Institute. He became a member of the All-Union Communist Party (bolsheviks) in 1930. As many like him, Kirilenko climbed up the Soviet hierarchy through the \\"industrial ladder\\"; by the 1960s, he was Vice-Chairman of the Bureau of the Central Committee of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic (RSFSR). After Nikita Khrushchev's forced resignation, Kirilenko became Leonid Brezhnev's \\"chief lieutenant\\" within the Central Committee. His main objective was to ensure Brezhnev's power base and, if possible, to strengthen Brezhnev's position within the Party. In order to accomplish this task, he emerged as one of the leading figures in the Secretariat under Brezhnev's rule. In this position, Kirilenko was responsible for personnel selection and supervision of economic planning throughout most of the Brezhnev Era. In 1976, Brezhnev appointed Konstantin Chernenko to be his \\"counterweight\\" in the Central Committee (CC). He became a member of the Political Bureau (Politburo) in 1965. He was forced to resign from active politics due to health reasons and because Yuri Andropov was appointed to the General Secretaryship. When Andropov became General Secretary in 1982, Kirilenko was pushed aside. He died on 12 May 1990 in Moscow. Early life and career Andrei Kirilenko was born on 8 September 1906 in the village of Alexeyevka, Belgorod Oblast, in the Russian Empire, to a working-class family. As a young boy, he worked as an electrician and a locksmith. In 1920, Kirilenko graduated from one of the local schools; five years later, he graduated from the Alekseevskii vocational technical school. In the mid-to- late 1920s, Kirilenko started working for a mining enterprise located in the Voronezh Oblast. He became an active member of Komsomol in 1929 and, two years later, became a member of the All-Union Communist Party. In 1936, he graduated from the Rybinsk Aviation Technology Institute. He started working as a design engineer for the aircraft factory, Zaporizhia Engine Plant. In 1938, Kirilenko became an active participant in party politics and was eventually selected to the position of Second Secretary of the Voroshilov District Party Committee in Zaporozhye Oblast. The following year, he was voted in as First Secretary. Later that year he was appointed to Second Secretary of the Zaporizhzhya Regional Party Committee of the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic. In this role, Kirilenko made significant contributions to the development of metallurgical and electrical engineering, but also other sorts of industry. During the Great Patriotic War, Kirilenko was directly involved with evacuating industry to safe zones. From 1941 to 1943, he was a member of the Military Soviet of the 18th Army of the Southern Front. He contributed by improving discipline among soldiers as well as improving the materiel support for the troops. In 1943, Kirilenko was relocated to Moscow, and during his stay there the production of advanced aircraft increased rapidly. By the end of the war, in 1944, Kirilenko was made First Secretary of the Zaporizhzhya Regional Party. He succeeded Leonid Brezhnev, future Soviet leader, as First Secretary of the Dnepropetrovsk Regional Party Committee. From 1955 to 1962, he was First Secretary of the Sverdlovsk Regional Party Committee; he was appointed by Nikita Khrushchev himself to take charge of economic planning and personnel selection in urban areas of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic (RSFSR). Kirilenko was later promoted to Khrushchev's Vice-Chairman of the Bureau of the Central Committee. Brezhnev benefited from Kirilenko's position, Brezhnev used him to win over supporters of his conspiracy against Khrushchev. Brezhnev era =Rise to prominence= Immediately after Khrushchev's ouster, a \\"collective leadership\\" had been formed with Brezhnev as First Secretary, Alexei Kosygin as head of government and Anastas Mikoyan (replaced in 1965 by Nikolai Podgorny) as head of state. Central Committee Secretaries Mikhail Suslov and Kirilenko were also a part of the collective leadership, with Kirilenko ranked fifth behind Brezhnev, Podgorny, Kosygin, and Suslov. In 1962, Kirilenko became a voting member of the Political Bureau (Politburo). In 1966, the Bureau of the Central Committee of the RSFSR was abolished, and Kirilenko became Brezhnev's chief lieutenant. Vadim Medvedev, a Soviet official, said Kirilenko's chief concern was maintaining and strengthening Brezhnev's position within the Party. Men who were loyal to Brezhnev were also loyal to Kirilenko. Konstantin Chernenko, another old Brezhnev prot√©g√©, became a \\"counterweight\\" to Kirilenko's power within the Central Committee (CC). Before Chernenko's rise in the Soviet hierarchy, Kirilenko provided detailed supervision of new party personnel and the economy. When Chernenko came on board in 1976, Kirilenko supervised the economy. By the mid-to-late 1970s, Kirilenko's health was beginning to decline, and his memory weakened. Despite his failing health, he was still a high-standing member, and he usually presided over the meetings of the Secretariat when Suslov was not around. While First World representatives treated Kirilenko as Second Secretary of the Communist Party because most of his duties had been associated with that office in the past, the position was actually held by Suslov. During most of his term, Kirilenko was one of four who had both a seat in the Secretariat and Politburo; the three others were Brezhnev, Suslov and Fyodor Kulakov. By 1976 Kirilenko's position within the Soviet leadership had grown to such an extent that leading officials, such as Brezhnev and Suslov, were beginning to worry about his \\"organisational tail\\" in the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic (RSFSR). His supervisory responsibilities led many of his colleagues to view him as a threat to the Party Organisational Work Department of the Central Committee ‚Äì the Central Committee department overseeing the civilian economy and the military‚Äìindustrial complex. His position was weakened drastically by the end of the year, his weakened position did not lead to a strengthening of the Collective leadership but to the weakening of it. =Later career and resignation= As with Kosygin, Kirilenko's leading position in the Soviet leadership was in \\"limbo\\" due to his support for economic reform to countenance the country's stagnating economy. Kirilenko grew increasingly estranged with Brezhnev in 1977, some believe that it was due to the growing economic hardship that faced the Soviet Union. It is said that the two argued over resource allocation and on how to modernise the ailing economy. However, the most common explanation is that Kirilenko grew estranged was because of his weakened position within the Collective leadership. Kirilenko led the Soviet delegation to the December 1977 MPLA Party Congress. At this congress, MPLA officially subscribed to the doctrine of Marxist-Leninism. This congress was important to the Soviet Union, and Kirilenko compared Angola's development with that of Vietnam. Kirilenko, along with Premier Kosygin, had been one of the most vocal opponents to a Soviet intervention in Afghanistan. He blamed the Afghan Party leadership for the rebellion against them, claiming that the Soviets \\"gave them everything.\\" He also disliked it when the Afghan leadership tried to justify their murderous actions on the grounds that Vladimir Lenin also did it. Kirilenko was seen as a possible candidate for the post of First Deputy Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet in 1977, however, First World observers tended to overrate the significance of the office, and because of it, their observation were completely off the mark. Vasili Kuznetsov, a 76-year-old man, was chosen to the office of First Deputy Chairman instead. During Brezhnev's later rule, KGB chairman Yuri Andropov gradually took over the functions and, eventually, Kirilenko's position within the Soviet leadership. In 1979, Kirilenko lost his unofficial office as supervisor of the defence industry over to Pavel Finogenov, a proteg√© of Dmitriy Ustinov. Kirilenko was seen as a key candidate by the West to replace Brezhnev as Soviet leader in 1982. After Brezhnev's death, Kirilenko was removed from the ruling Politburo by the new General Secretary Andropov. With his deteriorating health, having a disease known as arteriosclerosis, Kirilenko was disabled from ensuing active politics or protecting himself from Andropov's attacks. After Brezhnev's death and funeral, Kirilenko's mental condition deteriorated to where he could not remember the names of several leading Politburo members. He was unable to write properly during his later life; when asked by Andropov to write a letter of resignation in 1982, he was unable to do so. The decision to remove Kirilenko was taken before Andropov rose to power, so in the event Brezhnev had died later, Kirilenko would still have been forced to resign. The reason for the decision was that Kirilenko's son had tried to defect to the United Kingdom. Later life, death and recognition When compared to other Soviet politicians who shared the same fate, Kirilenko's downfall was, according to historian R. Judson Mitchell, a \\"relatively easy\\" fall from power. At Brezhnev's lying-in-state and subsequent funeral, he was allowed to stand next besides Brezhnev's family even if he was not a member of the Soviet leadership at the time. Kirilenko made his last public appearance in 1983, and was given an honorary retirement the same year. Mitchell believes that Andropov gave Kirilenko the honorary retirement so that he could win over Kirilenko's \\"organisational tail\\", literally Kirilenko's appointees to top- ranking offices during his years in service. He lived the rest of his life in Moscow and died on 12 May 1990. He was buried at the Troyekurovskoye Cemetery. During his lifetime, he was awarded the Hero of Socialist Labour twice, and he received six Orders of Lenin and one Order of the October Revolution.

Born in rural Russia in 1902, Suslov became a member of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) in 1921 and studied economics for much of the 1920s. He left his job as a teacher in 1931 to pursue politics full-time, becoming one of the many Soviet politicians who took part in the mass repression begun by Joseph Stalin's regime. He was made First Secretary of Stavropol Krai administrative area in 1939. During the war, Suslov headed the local Stavropol guerrilla movement. He became a member of the Organisational Bureau (Orgburo) of the Central Committee in 1946. In June 1950, he was elected to the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet. From 16 October, 1952, he was a full member of 19th Presidium of CPSU. Suslov lost much of the recognition and influence he had earned following the shuffle of the Soviet leadership after Stalin's death. However, by the late 1950s, Suslov had risen to become the leader of the hardline opposition to Nikita Khrushchev's revisionist leadership. After Khrushchev was ousted in 1964, Suslov supported the establishment of a collective leadership. He also supported inner-party democracy and opposed the reestablishment of the one-man rule as seen during the Stalin and Khrushchev Eras. During the Brezhnev Era, Suslov was considered to be the Party's chief ideologue and second-in-command. His death on 25 January 1982 is viewed as starting the battle to succeed Leonid Brezhnev in the post of General Secretary. Early years and career Suslov was born in Shakhovskoye, a rural locality in Pavlovsky District, Ulyanovsk Oblast, Russian Empire on 21 November 1902. Suslov began work in the local Komsomol organisation in Saratov in 1918, eventually becoming a member of the Poverty Relief Committee. After working in the Komsomol for nearly three years, Suslov became a member of the All-Union Communist Party (the Bolsheviks) in 1921. After graduating from the rabfak, he studied economics at the Plekhanov Institute of National Economy between 1924 and 1928. In the summer of 1928, after graduating from the Plekhanov institute, he became a graduate student (research fellow) in economics at the Institute of Red Professors, teaching at Moscow State University and at the Industrial Academy. In 1931, he abandoned teaching in favour of the party apparatus. He became an inspector on the Communist Party's Party Control Commission and on the People's Commissariat of the Workers' and Peasants' Inspectorate. His main task there was to adjudicate on large numbers of \\"personal cases\\", breaches of discipline, and appeals against expulsion from the party. In 1933 and 1934, Suslov directed a commission charged with purging the party in the Ural and Chernigov provinces. The purge was organised by Lazar Kaganovich, then Chairman of the Soviet Control Commission. Author Yuri Druzhnikov contends that Suslov was involved with setting up several show trials, and contributed to the Party by expelling all members deviating from the Party line, meaning Trotskyists, Zinovievists, and other left-wing deviationists. On the orders of Joseph Stalin, Suslov purged the city of Rostov in 1938. Suslov was made First Secretary of the Stavropol Krai's Communist Party in 1939. =Wartime activities (1941‚Äì1945)= Suslov in 1941. On the Eastern Front in World War II, Suslov was a member of Military Council of the North Caucasian Front and led the Stavropol Krai Headquarters of the Partisan Divisions (the local guerrilla movement) after the Germans occupied the area. According to Soviet historiography, Suslov's years as a guerrilla fighter were highly successful; however, testimonies from participants differ from the official account. These participants claim that there were a number of organisational problems which reduced their effectiveness on the battlefield. During the war, Suslov spent much of his time mobilising workers to fight against the German invaders. The guerrilla movement he led was operated by the regional party cells. During the liberation of the Northern Caucasus, Suslov maintained close contact with the Red Army. During the war, Suslov supervised the deportations of Chechens and other Muslim minorities from the Caucasus. From 1944 to 1946, he chaired the Central Committee Bureau for Lithuanian Affairs. Anti-Soviet samizdat literature from the height of his power in the 1970s would accuse him of being personally responsible for the deportation and killings of nationalist Lithuanians who became political opponents of the Soviets during the course of Soviet re-entry into the Baltic states on their drive to Berlin in 1944. Suslov, in the words of historian Simon Sebag-Montefiore, \\"brutally purged\\" the Baltics in the aftermath of the Second World War. =Stalin's prot√©g√©= Suslov (far right) in 1950 In 1946, Suslov was made a member of the Orgburo, and immediately became the Head of the Foreign Policy Department of the Central Committee. Within a year, Suslov was appointed Head of the Central Committee Department for Agitation and Propaganda. He also became a harsh critic of the Jewish Anti-Fascist Committee in the post-war years. In 1947, Suslov was transferred to Moscow and elected to the Central Committee Secretariat; he would retain this seat for the rest of his life. Suslov had the full confidence of Stalin, and in 1948, he was entrusted with the task of speaking on behalf of the Central Committee before a solemn meeting on the twenty-fourth anniversary of Vladimir Lenin's death. From September 1949 to 1950, he was editor-in-chief of the central Party daily Pravda. In 1949, Suslov became a member, along with Georgy Malenkov, Lavrentiy Beria, and Lazar Kaganovich, of a commission created to investigate charges levied against Moscow's local Communist Party First Secretary, Georgy Popov. Russian historian Roy Medvedev speculates in his book, Neizvestnyi Stalin, that Stalin had made Suslov his \\"secret heir\\". In June 1950, Suslov was elected to the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet. He was promoted to the CPSU Presidium (later known as the Politburo) in 1952 following the 19th Party Congress. He suffered a temporary reversal when Stalin died, and was dismissed from the Presidium in 1953. He continued to work in the Supreme Soviet, even becoming Chairman of the Commission of Foreign Affairs in the years immediately following Stalin's death. Khrushchev era Suslov recovered his authority in 1955, and was elected to a seat in the Presidium, bypassing the customary candidate membership. In the 20th Party Congress of 1956, Khrushchev delivered the famous Secret Speech about Stalin's cult of personality. In Suslov's ideological report on 16 February, he updated his criticism of Stalin and his personality cult: During the Hungarian Revolution of 1956, Suslov, along with Anastas Mikoyan, operated in close proximity to Budapest in order to direct the activities of the Soviet troops and to lend assistance to the new Hungarian leadership. Suslov and Mikoyan attended the Politburo meeting of the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party which elected J√°nos K√°d√°r to the General Secretaryship. In a telegram to the Soviet leadership, Suslov and Mikoyan acknowledged that the situation had become more dire, but both were content with the dismissal of Ern≈ë Ger≈ë as General Secretary and the choice of K√°d√°r as his successor. The Presidium of the Supreme Soviet criticised Suslov's and Mikoyan's concessions to the new revolutionary government in the People's Republic of Hungary. Despite his initial reservations, Suslov eventually supported the Presidium's decision to intervene in Hungary militarily and replace the counterrevolutionary government's leadership there. In June 1957, Suslov backed Khrushchev during his struggle with the Anti-Party Group led by Georgy Malenkov, Vyacheslav Molotov, Lazar Kaganovich, and Dmitry Shepilov. Mikoyan later wrote in his memoirs that he convinced Suslov to support Khrushchev by telling him that Khrushchev would emerge the winner even if he did not have enough support in the Presidium. The following October Suslov accused Georgy Zhukov, the Minister of Defence, of \\"Bonapartism\\" at the Central Committee plenum that removed him from all Party and government posts. The removal of Zhukov had the effect of firmly subordinating the armed forces to Party control. In a speech on 22 January 1958, Khrushchev officially proposed to dissolve the Machine and Tractor Stations (MTS). This reform had a particular salience on Soviet ideology. In Marxist-Leninist doctrine, cooperative ownership of property was considered a \\"lower\\" form of public ownership than state ownership. Khrushchev's proposal to expand cooperative ownership ran contrary to the Marxist theory as interpreted by Stalin. Suslov, who supported Stalin's economic policy, regarded Khrushchev's proposal as unacceptable on ideological grounds. In an election speech to the Supreme Soviet in March 1958, Suslov refused to recognise the ideological significance of Khrushchev's reform, preferring instead to focus on the reform's practical benefits in improving productivity. Unlike other Party leaders, Suslov avoided mentioning Khrushchev as the MTS reform's initiator. The 21st Party Congress convened in January 1959. Khrushchev wanted to consider the draft of a new Seven-Year plan. Suslov cautiously demonstrated against Khrushchev's statement that the country had developed from the socialist state of development to the higher state of communist development. He saw Khrushchev's view as flawed, and countered that his view had not been approved by the Party. To discredit Khrushchev's assertion further, Suslov deferred to Karl Marx and Vladimir Lenin: Suslov was becoming progressively more critical of Khrushchev's policies, his political intransigence, and his campaign to eliminate what was left of the old Stalinist guard. There were also deep-seated divergences in foreign and domestic policy between Suslov and Khrushchev. Suslov opposed the idea of improving Soviet Union‚ÄìUnited States relations, and was against Khrushchev's attempts at rapprochement with Yugoslavia. Domestically, Suslov opposed Khrushchev's policy of de-Stalinisation and his economic decentralisation scheme. Suslov visited the United Kingdom in 1959 as a parliamentarian for the Supreme Soviet. The visit was a success, and Hugh Gaitskell, the Leader of the Labour Party, travelled to the Soviet Union later that year as a guest. Sino‚ÄìSoviet relations had long been strained, and as Suslov told the Central Committee in one of his reports, \\"The crux of the matter is that the Leadership of the CCP has recently developed tendencies to exaggerate the degree of maturity of socialist relations in China... There are elements of conceit and haughtiness. [These shortcomings] are largely explained by the atmosphere of the cult of personality of comrade Mao Zedong... who, by all accounts, himself has come to believe in his own infallibility.\\" Suslov compared Mao's growing personality cult with that seen under Joseph Stalin. In the years following the failure of the Anti-Party Group, Suslov became the leader of the opposition faction in the Central Committee, known as the \\"Moscow faction\\", to Khrushchev's leadership. Khrushchev was able to hold on to power by conceding to various opposition demands in times of crisis, such as during the 1960 U-2 incident and the Cuban Missile Crisis. In the aftermath of the U-2 Crisis Suslov was able to remove, and replace, several of Khrushchev's appointees in the Politburo with new anti-Khrushchevist members. Khrushchev's position was greatly weakened after the failure of the Cuban Missile Crisis, and Suslov's power greatly increased. A campaign to oust Khrushchev from office was initiated in 1964. Although leader of the opposition, Suslov had fallen seriously ill during his trip to the People's Republic of China the previous year; instead, Leonid Brezhnev and Alexei Kosygin led the opposition. Brezhnev era =Collective leadership= Socialist Unity Party. In October 1964, Khrushchev was ousted. Suslov played a crucial role in the event. Suslov was, alongside Premier Alexei Kosygin and First Secretary Leonid Brezhnev, one of the most influential Soviet politicians of the 1960s following the ouster of Khrushchev. Having led the opposition against Khrushchev for years, Suslov had acquired and wielded great power within the Central Committee when Brezhnev rose to power. However, Suslov was never interested in becoming the leader of the Soviet Union, and was content to remain the man behind the scenes. During most of his term, Suslov was one of four people who had both a seat in the Secretariat and the Politburo; the three others were Brezhnev, Andrei Kirilenko and Fyodor Kulakov. A collective leadership was founded immediately after Khrushchev's ouster, consisting of Brezhnev as First Secretary, Kosygin as head of government, and Anastas Mikoyan (and later Nikolai Podgorny) as head of state. From the beginning, Suslov was a vocal critic of one-man rule such as that seen under Joseph Stalin and Khrushchev. While he condemned Stalin's one-man rule, he equally criticised the individualistic assertiveness of Khrushchev's de-Stalinisation policy. A strong supporter of democratic centralism, Suslov prevented Brezhnev from taking over Kosygin's post as head of government in 1970. Kirilenko, Brezhnev, and Suslov were members of an unofficial Troika within the Communist Party leadership. Suslov was ranked fourth in the Politburo hierarchy behind Brezhnev, Podgorny and Kosygin, ahead of Kirilenko. Throughout the Brezhnev Era, Suslov became increasingly hardline. Suslov was opposed to any sort of anti-Soviet policies attempted by the Eastern Bloc leaders, but voted against Soviet military intervention in both the People's Republic of Hungary in 1956 (initially), and in the Czechoslovak Socialist Republic in 1968 during the Prague Spring. Suslov was regarded, according to Christian Schmidt-H√§uer, as the \\"pope\\" for \\"Orthodox communists\\" in the Eastern Bloc. Throughout his political career, Suslov became increasingly concerned that the Soviet Union's leading role in the communist movement would be compromised. H√§uer, in his book Gorbachev: The Path to Power, argues that Suslov \\"was a Russian nationalist\\" who believed \\"Russia was the centre of the universe\\". It was during the Brezhnev Era that Suslov was given the unofficial title \\"Chief Ideologue of the Communist Party\\". Suslov spent much time in memorializing the legacies of Vladimir Lenin, Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels. However, Suslov followed the party line and supported the retreat from some of the beliefs of Marxism-Leninism. Examples of ideological retreat include the end of single, Party-approved natural science versions of biology, chemistry and physics. There still existed a tight ideological control over literature. This included not only literature critical of Soviet rule: much of Lenin's work was also routinely censored. =Later life and death= Suslov's tomb in the Kremlin Wall Necropolis At the beginning of the 1980s, the political and economic turmoil in the People's Republic of Poland had seriously eroded the authority of the Polish United Workers' Party. Suslov's position on this matter carried particular weight as he chaired a Politburo Commission, established on 25 August 1980, on how to deal with the Polish crisis. Members of the commission included such high-ranking Soviets as Andropov, Minister of Defence Dmitriy Ustinov, Minister of Foreign Affairs Andrei Gromyko, and Brezhnev's long-time associate Konstantin Chernenko. On 28 August, the Commission considered Soviet military intervention to stabilize the region. Wojciech Jaruzelski, First Secretary of the Polish United Workers' Party, was able to persuade the Commission that a Soviet military intervention would only aggravate the situation. Suslov agreed with Jaruzelski's argument, stating that \\"if troops are introduced, that will mean a catastrophe. I think that we all share the unanimous opinion here that there can be no discussion of any introduction of troops\\". Suslov was able to persuade Jaruzelski and the Polish leadership to establish martial law in Poland. In January 1982, Yuri Andropov revealed to Suslov that Semyon Tsvigun, the First Deputy Chairman of the KGB, had shielded Galina and Yuri, Brezhnev's children, from corruption investigations. When these facts were revealed to him, Suslov challenged Tsvigun to make a statement on the matter. Suslov even threatened Tsvigun with an expulsion from the Communist Party, but Tsvigun died on 19 January 1982 before he could challenge Suslov's statement. Two days later, Suslov had a coronary, and died on 25 January of arteriosclerosis and diabetes. His death is viewed as starting the battle to succeed Brezhnev, in which Andropov, who assumed Suslov's post as the Party's Second Secretary, sidelined Kirilenko and Chernenko during the last days of Brezhnev's rule. Suslov was buried on 29 January at the Kremlin Wall Necropolis. Brezhnev expressed great sadness at Suslov's passing. Recognition Suslov was awarded several decorations and medals during his life; among them were two Hero of Socialist Labour awards, five Orders of Lenin, one Order of the October Revolution, and one first degree Order of the Patriotic War. The USSR Academy of Sciences awarded Suslov with the Gold Medal of Karl Marx. Suslov was awarded the highest state awards of the German Democratic Republic, the Mongolian People's Republic, and the Czechoslovak Socialist Republic. Personal life Suslov married Yelizaveta Alexandrovna (1903‚Äì1972), who worked as the Director of the Moscow Institute for Stomatology. In her life, she badly suffered from internal diseases, especially diabetes in a severe form, but ignored her physician's recommendations. Bernard Lown, a Lithuanian-born American M.D., was once requested to see her in the Kremlin Hospital; it was one of the few cases where a renowned foreign doctor was invited to visit the Kremlin Hospital. Suslov expressed his gratitude for Lown's work, but avoided meeting Lown in person because he was a representative of an \\"imperialistic\\" country. Yelizaveta and Suslov had two children, Revoly (born 1929), named after the Russian Revolution, and his second child, Maya (born 1939), named after May Day.

He served as a Central Committee secretary in charge of the Soviet military‚Äìindustrial complex from 1965 to 1976 and as Minister of Defence of the Soviet Union from 1976 until his death in 1984. Ustinov was born in the city of Samara to a Russian working-class family in 1908. Upon reaching adulthood, he joined the Communist Party in 1927 before pursuing a career in engineering. After graduating from the Institute of Military Mechanical Engineering in 1934, he became a construction engineer at the Leningrad Artillery Marine Research Institute. By 1937, he transferred to the Bolshevik \\"Arms\\" Factory where he ultimately rose to become the director. While serving as People's Commissar of Armaments during World War II, he achieved distinction within the party's ranks by successfully overseeing the evacuation of Leningrad's industries to the Ural Mountains, a feat for which he was awarded the title of Hero of Socialist Labour. At the war's end, he was entrusted with seizing raw materials, scientists and research left over from Germany's missile programme. Under Leonid Brezhnev's leadership, Ustinov joined the Central Committee Secretariat and rose to become a candidate member of the Politburo by 1965. Following his rise to the central party apparatus, he was given the task of administering the Soviet Union's defense industry and its armed forces. By 1976, he succeeded Andrei Grechko as Minister of Defense and received the rank of Marshal of the Soviet Union. When Brezhnev's health deteriorated during the last years of his leadership, Ustinov formed a troika alongside Foreign Minister Andrei Gromyko and KGB Chairman Yuri Andropov whose hostility to political reform and hardline attitudes towards the West would dictate Soviet policy until Mikhail Gorbachev's rise to power. Early life Dmitry Feodorovich Ustinov was born in a working-class family in Samara. During the civil war, when hunger became intolerable, his sick father went to Samarkand, leaving Dmitry as head of the family. Shortly after that, in 1922, his father died. In 1923, he and his mother, Yevrosinya Martinovna, moved to the city of Makarev (near Ivanovo-Voznesensk) where he worked as a fitter in a paper mill. Shortly after that, in 1925, his mother died. Ustinov joined the communist party in 1927. In 1929, he started training at the Faculty of Mechanics in the Polytechnic Institute of Ivanovo-Voznesensk. Afterward, Ustinov was transferred to the Moscow Bauman Higher Technical School. Then, in March 1932, he entered the Institute of Military Mechanical Engineering in Leningrad from where he graduated in 1934. Afterward, he worked as a construction engineer at the Leningrad artillery Marine Research Institute. In 1937, he was transferred to the \\"Bolshevik\\" Arms Factory as an engineer. He later became the director of the Factory. War service At the time of the Nazi invasion of the Soviet Union, in June 1941, Stalin appointed the 32-year- old Ustinov to the post of People's Commissar of Armaments. From this position, he supervised the massive evacuation of the defence industry from the besieged city of Leningrad to east of the Ural Mountains. Over 80 military industries were evacuated that together employed over six hundred thousand workers, technicians, and engineers. Stalin later rewarded Ustinov, whom he called \\"the Red-head\\", with the Soviet Union's highest civilian honour, Hero of Socialist Labour. After the war was over, Ustinov played a crucial role in requisitioning the German missile programme, developed during World War II, as an impetus to the Soviet missile and space programmes. Post-war career In 1952, Ustinov became a member of the Central Committee. In March 1953, after Stalin died, the Ministry of Armaments was combined with the Ministry of Aviation Industry to become the Ministry of Defense Industry, with Ustinov assigned as head of this new ministry. In 1957, he was appointed as a Deputy Premier of the Soviet Union and became chairman of the Military-Industrial Commission. =Rise to the Soviet leadership= Brezhnev and Ustinov at the 1979 October Revolution Day Parade on Red Square celebrating the 62nd anniversary of the revolution. Leonid Brezhnev took power after the ousting of Khrushchev, and Ustinov returned to the defence industry. In 1965, Brezhnev made Ustinov a candidate member of the Politburo and secretary of the Central Committee with oversight of the military, the defense industry, and certain security organs. He was also placed in charge of developing the Soviet Union's strategic bomber force and intercontinental ballistic missile system. Ustinov was known in the defense industry as Uncle Mitya. He was also Chelomey's stolid personal adversary. He issued a directive, in February 1970, that ordered the Chelomei design bureau to combine its Almaz space station with Sergei Korolyov's design bureau, headed by Vasili Mishin. This order was designed as an impetus towards the development of the Salyut space station. Ustinov gained power in the bureaucracy as he rose in the defence industry. =Minister of Defence= In 1976, after Andrei Grechko died on 26 April, Ustinov became the Defence Minister and was promoted to General of the Army on 29 April. On 30 July, he was promoted to the highest military rank in the Soviet Union, Marshal of the Soviet Union, although he had no prior military career. Together, with Marshal Nikolai Ogarkov and the Soviet General Staff, Ustinov embarked on a programme to enhance and modernise the Soviet Union's development of military sciences. In 1979, he confidently asserted that \\"The armed forces of the USSR are on a high level that ensures the accomplishment of any tasks set by the party and the people\\". The growing influence of the Soviet military gave Ustinov the role of Kremlin kingmaker, for his support was decisive in allowing Yuri Andropov to succeed Brezhnev. Ustinov was also influential in the Chernenko regime, compensating for the latter's serious health problems and inexperience in military affairs. In 1984 in East Berlin, with Erich Honecker. In 1979, Hafizullah Amin assassinated the leader of Afghanistan, Nur Muhammad Taraki. In October 1979, the sentiment for Soviet military intervention in Afghanistan grew stronger in the Soviet politburo where Ustinov and Andropov were the strongest proponents for military intervention. Soviet Foreign Minister Andrei Gromyko also lent his support for an invasion. The introduction of US forces into the Persian Gulf after the 1979 Iran hostage crisis particularly alarmed the Soviet General Staff. Ustinov began to wonder, \\"If the Americans do all these preparations under our noses, then why should we hunker down, play cautious, and lose Afghanistan?\\" In November, Ustinov and Andropov began to formulate plans for a Soviet military invasion of Afghanistan. On 12 December 1979, the Politburo approved the Ustinov-Andropov plan to invade Afghanistan. On 24 December 1979, Soviet troops entered Afghanistan. In the early 1980s, the development of the Space Shuttle program in the United States caused considerable concern in the Soviet defense industry. While Defence Minister, Ustinov received a report from his analysts that the US Shuttle could be used to deploy space based nuclear missiles over Soviet territory. Russian space programme academic Boris Chertok recounts that Ustinov was so worried about the US Shuttle that he gave the development of the Soviet response program, the Buran Shuttle, top priority. =Involvement in the KAL 007 Disaster= In 1992, Russian president Boris Yeltsin disclosed five top-secret memos dating from late 1983, memos that had been written within weeks of the downing of Korean Air Lines Flight 007. These memos were published in Izvestia number 228 on October 16, 1992. According to these memos, the Soviet Union had been able to recover the \\"Black Box\\" from KAL 007 and decipher its tapes. Thereafter, Ustinov, along with Viktor Chebrikov, head of the KGB, recommended to premier Yuri Andropov that their possession of the Black Box not be made public since its tapes could not support the Soviet contention that KAL 007 was on a U.S. espionage mission. > \\"In connection with all mentioned above it seems highly preferable not to > transfer the flight recorders to the International Civil Aviation > Organization (ICAO) or any third party willing to decipher their contents. > The fact that the recorders are in possession of the USSR shall be kept > secret. As far as we are aware neither the US nor Japan has any information > on the flight recorders. We have made necessary efforts in order to prevent > any disclosure of the information in future.\\" (Memo 5.) Death and legacy On 7 November 1984, Ustinov did not preside over the annual Red Square Military Parade on the October Revolution Day. First Deputy Defense Minister Marshal Sergey Sokolov stood in for Ustinov to both inspect the troops and deliver the commemoration speech. Ustinov had contracted pneumonia in late October. Emergency surgery had to be performed to correct an aneurysm in his aortic valve. His liver and kidneys later deteriorated. Eventually, he suffered a cardiac arrest that killed him. He was honored with a state funeral, and his ashes were interred in the Kremlin Wall Necropolis on 24 December 1984. The RFS Marshal Ustinov is a Russian warship named after him in his honor. The Baltic State Technical Military-Mechanical University in Saint Petersburg changed its name to the Ustinov Baltic State Technical Military-Mechanical University. The city of Izhevsk was also renamed after him from 1984 to 1987; however, under Mikhail Gorbachev, cities that had been renamed for recent Soviet leaders were reverted to their former names. Ustinov placed great importance on the military for many decades. For example, he succeeded in always keeping the USSR's intercontinental ballistic missiles, ICBMs, current. Ustinov also wrote several books throughout his life. These included \\"Selected Speeches and Articles\\" (1979), and \\"To serve my country - the cause of Communism\\" (1982). Personality and family In his memoirs Mikhail Gorbachev describes Ustinov as a man who normally had an energetic and bright personality. When Gorbachev was facing opposition in the Politburo shortly after Andropov's death, Ustinov told Gorbachev to \\"stand firm\\" and to \\"take heart\\". Soviet Army Colonel General Igor Illarionov, an assistant of Ustinov for 30 years, described him as \\"the most Stalinist of all the Commissars\\". Indeed, Ustinov had been groomed by Stalin to maintain the established system. Illarionov also spoke that Ustinov, like many of his contemporaries, was shaped by his experiences in the Great Patriotic War. Illarionov described Ustinov as a man who was very passionate about his work and had a habit of working late at night and sleeping for a couple of hours during the day. The former head of the 4th Chief of the Ministry of Health, Academician Yevgeniy Chazov wrote about Ustinov: \\"I met him for the first time thanks to Andropov, who was his close friend. From the first moment I liked his will power, quick decision making, optimism, drive, expertise, combined with a certain simplicity and openness. In my mind, he represented the best representatives of the so-called command-and-control systems by which we defeated Germany during World War II. I think his only mistake, which he may not have realized, was the Afghan war. A bad politician and diplomat, he, as a representative of the old Stalinist \\"guard\\", believed that all issues could be solved via a position of strength. On the other hand, I saw Andropov tossed and nervous because of the Afghan war. I believe that he ultimately understood their mistake. Ustinov, however, was always calm and apparently convinced that he was right.\\" However, Ustinov's unwillingness to support any kind of reforms, even if popular within the Politburo itself, led to him frequently clashing with the Chief of the General Staff, Marshal Nikolai Ogarkov. Ogarkov and many Officers of the General Staff resented Ustinov's influence over Brezhnev, viewing him as a lobby for the interests of the Defense Industries against those of the Military. This became problematic for Ogarkov, since he favored reducing the massive Soviet military into a more compact strike force that utilized high-technology conventional arms and centered around Special Forces operations. Ustinov on the other hand (his lobbying for the defense industries notwithstanding), favored the usual emphasis on manpower and nuclear deterrence to maintain his \\"high intensity non-nuclear conflict\\" strategy, despite the lack of efficiency that became apparent in Afghanistan. In light of this, although Ustinov dramatically increased the technological capabilities of the Soviet Armed forces, most of the improvements were directed towards the operation of Strategic Nuclear Weapons, such as the Typhoon-class submarine, the Tu-160 bomber, and the SS-20 Saber IRBMs. Despite these improvements, much of the technology developed by the Soviet Armed forces were still a generation behind that of the United States. Ogarkov believed that reforms (both political and economic) were the only way to truly allow the Soviet Military to modernize at a level that would be on par with the United States. Ustinov was married to Taisa Alekseevna Briekalova-Ustinova (1903‚Äì1975). They had a daughter, Vera Dmitriyvna Ustinova, and a son, Nikolai Dmitriyvich Ustinov (1931‚Äì1992). Ustinov also had a granddaughter, Nastya Nemtsova. In popular culture Ustinov appears briefly in Tom Clancy's 1984 novel The Hunt for Red October in his capacity as Defense Minister; his death is mentioned by the titular spy Colonel Filitov in The Cardinal of the Kremlin.

The DSP-1 (referred to by Yamaha as a Digital Soundfield Processor) allowed owners to synthesize up to 6-channels of surround sound from 2 channel stereo sound via a complex digital signal processor (DSP). Much like today's home theater receivers the DSP-1 offered sixteen \\"sound fields\\" created through the DSP including a jazz club, a cathedral, a concert hall, and a stadium. However, unlike today's integrated amps and receivers, these soundfield modes were highly editable, allowing the owner to customize the effect to his or her own personal taste. The DSP-1 also included an analog Dolby Surround decoder as well as other effects such as real-time echo and pitch change. Most of the DSP-1's controls are on the unit's remote control. The reason, as mentioned in the manual, being that it was felt that adjustments should be done at the listening position. This can make it difficult for collectors to find a complete functioning unit, although there is at least one provider of aftermarket remote controls with duplicate programming for the DSP-1 if needed. In Dolby Surround mode, only 4 channels are active, with just the front main channels and rear surround channels operating, the forward surround channels being muted.

It opened in 1970, taking its name from the Cosumnes River which flows just a few miles to the south. As of Spring 2017, enrollment was at 13,091 students at its main and satellite campus in Elk Grove, California. Folsom Lake College, a former satellite campus, attained independence in 2004. History The concept for Cosumnes River College was included in a Master Facility Need Study that was approved by the Board of Trustees of the Los Rios Community College District in February 1967. A campus site of was obtained and construction proceeded on a library building, a science building, an automotive and technology complex, a women's physical education building, and a swimming pool. In the fall of 1970 the college opened with an initial enrollment of about 2,100. The architect who designed the original buildings of the college is Nacht & Lewis Architects of Sacramento. They also designed the Learning Resource Center in 2005. In September 1975, the Business/Social Science building was dedicated, which included computer laboratories. In the spring of 1989, the California state finals for the National Geography Bee were first held within the recital hall. They have been held there in April ever since. In fall of 1990, the cafeteria building was opened, with facilities for both staff and student dining, and also for the instructional food service program. The next phase of construction was in the summer of 1991, which added the College Center building with space for the Admissions/Records, Financial Aid, Business Services, Administration and the book store. In fall of 1995 a visual and performing arts complex was opened, completing the roster of facilities in the college's original plan. A permanent Child Development Center was completed in March 2002, and in December 2003 staff moved into a new Southeast Office Complex. In 2004, the Folsom Lake Center was revamped as Folsom Lake College, as fourth community college under Los Rios Community College District. In 2004, construction on the Operations and Public Safety (OPS) building was completed. The building houses a variety of support services and departments. This includes a Health Services office staffed by college nurses, the Operations Department offices (housing the offices for Custodial/Maintenance Services and for Facility Use Processing), a Mail and Printing Center, and a substation of the Los Rios Community College Police Department. The two-story Learning Resource Center was dedicated in 2005 with classroom space, and special computer labs for English as a Second Language, Digital Media, Journalism, and a Math Center. These buildings were funded in part from a voter-approved community college district bond, Measure A. The college's plans also include construction of an Elk Grove Center in the southern part of Elk Grove, California, United States. The center site was dedicated with a ground breaking in 2011. Construction also began in 2011 on the $18-million Winn Center for Construction and Architecture which will provide instructional space for Construction, Construction Management Technology, Pharmacy Technology, and Photography among other programs. The building was supported by a $1-million gift from Mike Winn and family. In partnership with the Sacramento Regional Transit, (SACRT) construction the CRC/Regional Transit Parking Structure began in 2011. In 2015, the college received light rail service when the Blue Line was extended to terminate at a new station on Bruceville Road on the east side of the campus.  Campus  The college occupies a campus of on the south side of Sacramento.  Organization and administration  The college is part of the Los Rios Community College District.  Academic profile  The college offers learning alternatives to the traditional classroom, including online and interactive televised classes.

Student life  Cosumnes River College is home to The Connection, an award-winning biweekly newspaper. An opinion zine, The Voice, is also published on campus. Cosumnes River College is also home to the environmental student organization 'Students for a Sustainable Future Club' or SSF Club. Established in 2011, this group exists to promote sustainability and environmentalism through education, advocacy, and activism both on campus and in the community. This club is an official chapter of the California Student Sustainability Coalition as well as an affiliate of the Sierra Student Coalition.  Athletics  The college was a factor in area college sports from the very beginning. It opened up the 1971 football season against reigning state champion College of the Redwoods and nearly pulled off an upset. That team was coached by Coit Conant. During the short period of time that the school fielded a football team 1971-1978, it was the predominant area power in that sport. The school has provided powerful teams in all other sports since the inception of the school winning several conference titles. In 2006, the college became home to the now-defunct Sacramento Heatwave of the American Basketball Association (ABA). In 2012, The Cosumnes River Hawks Baseball team took home the school's first ever state championship. In 2012 and 2013, the college's Community Athletic Center hosted the California Community College Athletic Association state basketball Final Four and Championship tournament. Major construction of new athletic fields on the north side of campus was completed in 2012-13, including two soccer fields, softball complex, baseball complex (renamed Conway Field), and complete remodeling of the shared-use football stadium with the addition of artificial turf.

His parents were told that he had developed \\"water on the brain\\" or hydrocephalus. As luck would have it Holter's son was being looked after in Philadelphia, where the surgeons Nulsen and Spitz had already demonstrated that a ventricle- to-atrium diversion system could work.

After a medically suitable grade of Silastic (silicone and rubber) was found, the device was patented, and John Holter set up a company, Holter- Hausner International, to manufacture the cerebral shunts.

However, Steinbach is supported by her own party and the CSU, both of which have called upon Westerwelle to give up his resistance, and have cited earlier statements by Westerwelle where he had praised Steinbach a few years ago. In 2006 she was involved in an exhibition on the expulsions in Europe in the 20th century. The exhibition deals with expulsions of German, Armenians, Poles, Turks, Greeks, Latvians, Karelians, Ukrainians, Italians and other peoples - topics many Europeans are unfamiliar with. =International human rights activism= As the CDU/CSU spokeswoman for human rights, Erika Steinbach is involved in a number of activities promoting human rights worldwide. She was an expert speaker at the International Cuba Conference of the International Society for Human Rights in 2006. =Franz Werfel Human Rights Award= Together with Peter Glotz, she was the primary initiator of the Franz Werfel Human Rights Award, and serves as a jury member together with Otto von Habsburg, Klaus H√§nsch and Otto Graf Lambsdorff among others.

Steinbach, in support of other members of her expellee organization, said that the German attack on Poland was just a response to Poland's mobilization, resulting in criticism of her. Steinbach's resignation was met with mixed feelings within the CDU/CSU. Some members were worried that her departure could cause a split, and a formation of a new right wing party in Germany. = End of CDU membership = Steinbach left the CDU in January 2017, stating that Chancellor Angela Merkel's decisions during the European migrant crisis, which she called a violation of the German law, prompted her decision. She did not run in the 2017 federal election. = Affiliation with the AfD= After leaving the CDU, Steinbach became informally associated with the AfD. In 2018 Steinbach became President of the Desiderius-Erasmus-Stiftung, a political foundation affiliated with the AfD.Erika Steinbach neue Vorsitzende AfD-naher Stiftung As President of the foundation, Steinbach has also advocated pro-Israeli views.Juden und die AfD, geht das zusammen? =Interest in language= Steinbach was member of the Goethe-Institut from 1994 to 2002.Munzinger Online, s.v.

She is also a strong supporter of the process of European integration. Steinbach endorses the Charter of the German expellees of August 1950. =Social policy= Erika Steinbach holds conservative views on social policy and opposes abortion and same-sex marriage, which sometimes has caused controversy. =Immigration= Since the onset of the European migrant crisis, Steinbach has been one of the most vocal critics of Chancellor Merkel's refugee policies. This resulted in her leaving the CDU in January 2017; she said that allowing so many people into Germany for months without identifying them properly went \\"against our laws and against EU treaties\\" and that she could no longer support the CDU. Perception Erika Steinbach is much more widely known in Poland and the Czech Republic than in Germany. According to Cordell and Wolff (2005), the political importance the Federation of Expellees has in German politics is overestimated in Poland and the Czech Republic because of its disproportional media presence in those countries and campaigns of \\"aggressively nationalist politicians\\". =Criticism= Steinbach's public pronouncements have been criticized by late President of Poland Lech Kaczy≈Ñski for causing a deterioration in German-Polish relations. Steinbach has a negative reputation in Poland. One example of this was a 2003 cover montage of Polish news magazine Wprost that depicted her riding Chancellor Gerhard Schr√∂der while wearing an SS uniform.http://www.spiegel.de/img/0,1020,721659,00.jpg In 2007 Gazeta Wyborcza, a popular newspaper in Poland, reproduced a leafletpolish leaflet of 2007 presenting Steinbach in the succession of the Teutonic Knights and the Nazis, and repeated claims of the full compensations never paid to Poland for losses caused by Nazi Germany. Polish ambassador to Germany, Marek Prawda, Poland's Foreign Minister Rados≈Çaw Sikorski and Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk expressed unease with Steinbach's appointment to the board of the Center against Expulsions in February 2009. W≈Çadys≈Çaw Bartoszewski, an Auschwitz survivor who is Poland‚Äôs commissioner on relations with Germany, said that giving Mrs Steinbach a seat on the board would be akin to the Vatican appointing a Holocaust denier like Richard Williamson to manage relations with Israel. On 16 September 2010, Steinbach attested Bartoszewski \\"a bad character\\" on German TV. At the time the Polish foreign minister, Rados≈Çaw Sikorski, privately warned Berlin that allowing Mrs Steinbach‚Äôs appointment would shake German-Polish relations ‚Äúto their foundations‚Äù. \\"Do people whose families lived there for generations want to be identified with a person like Mrs. Steinbach, who came to our country with Hitler and had to leave it with Hitler too?\\" Sikorski said in Brussels on 23 February 2009, referring to Steinbach‚Äôs father having moved to German occupied Poland during the war and asked her to follow the example of President Horst K√∂hler, who was born within a family of wartime German settlers in Poland and never considered himself an expellee. The fact that Steinbach represents a person born to a German officer stationed in occupied Poland has been described as one of the essential issues for Poles. V√°clav Havel, the former president of the Czech Republic, an anti-communist dissident has been said to refuse to speak to Steinbach due to the positions taken by the Federation of Expellees under her leadership.

A PPF illustrates several economic concepts, such as allocative efficiency, economies of scale, opportunity cost (or marginal rate of transformation), productive efficiency, and scarcity of resources (the fundamental economic problem that all societies face). Sickles, R., & Zelenyuk, V. (2019). Measurement of Productivity and Efficiency: Theory and Practice. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. doi:10.1017/9781139565981 This tradeoff is usually considered for an economy, but also applies to each individual, household, and economic organization. One good can only be produced by diverting resources from other goods, and so by producing less of them. Graphically bounding the production set for fixed input quantities, the PPF curve shows the maximum possible production level of one commodity for any given production level of the other, given the existing state of technology. By doing so, it defines productive efficiency in the context of that production set: a point on the frontier indicates efficient use of the available inputs (such as points B, D and C in the graph), a point beneath the curve (such as A) indicates inefficiency, and a point beyond the curve (such as X) indicates impossibility. An example PPF with illustrative points marked PPFs are normally drawn as bulging upwards or outwards from the origin (\\"concave\\" when viewed from the origin), but they can be represented as bulging downward (inwards) or linear (straight), depending on a number of assumptions. An outward shift of the PPC results from growth of the availability of inputs, such as physical capital or labour, or from technological progress in knowledge of how to transform inputs into outputs. Such a shift reflects, for instance, economic growth of an economy already operating at its full productivity (on the PPF), which means that more of both outputs can now be produced during the specified period of time without sacrificing the output of either good. Conversely, the PPF will shift inward if the labour force shrinks, the supply of raw materials is depleted, or a natural disaster decreases the stock of physical capital. However, most economic contractions reflect not that less can be produced but that the economy has started operating below the frontier, as typically, both labour and physical capital are underemployed, remaining therefore idle. In microeconomics, the PPF shows the options open to an individual, household, or firm in a two good world. By definition, each point on the curve is productively efficient, but, given the nature of market demand, some points will be more profitable than others. Equilibrium for a firm will be the combination of outputs on the PPF that is most profitable. From a macroeconomic perspective, the PPF illustrates the production possibilities available to a nation or economy during a given period of time for broad categories of output. It is traditionally used to show the movement between committing all funds to consumption on the y-axis versus investment on the x-axis. However, an economy may achieve productive efficiency without necessarily being allocatively efficient. Market failure (such as imperfect competition or externalities) and some institutions of social decision-making (such as government and tradition) may lead to the wrong combination of goods being produced (hence the wrong mix of resources being allocated between producing the two goods) compared to what consumers would prefer, given what is feasible on the PPF.  Position  An unbiased expansion in a PPF The two main determinants of the position of the PPF at any given time are the state of technology and management expertise (which are reflected in the available production functions) and the available quantities of factors of production (materials, direct labor, and factory overhead). Only points on or within a PPF are actually possible to achieve in the short run. In the long run, if technology improves or if the supply of factors of production increases, the economy's capacity to produce both goods increases; if this potential is realized, economic growth occurs. That increase is shown by a shift of the production-possibility frontier to the right. Conversely, a natural, military or ecological disaster might move the PPF to the left in response to a reduction in an economy's productive capability. Thus all points on or within the curve are part of the production set: combinations of goods that the economy could potentially produce. If the two production goods depicted are capital investment (to increase future production possibilities) and current consumption goods, the higher the investment this year, the more the PPF would shift out in following years.Samuelson, Paul A., and William D. Nordhaus (2004). Economics. Ch. 1, \\"Figure 1-5. Investment for Future Consumption Requires Sacrificing Current Consumption.\\" Shifts of the curve can represent how technological progress that favors production possibilities of one good, say guns, more than the other shifts the PPF outwards more along the favored good's axis, \\"biasing\\" production possibilities in that direction. Similarly, if one good makes more use of say capital and if capital grows faster than other factors, growth possibilities might be biased in favor of the capital- intensive good.Gillespie, Andrew (2007). Foundations of Economics, \\"The production possibility frontier (curve): the PPF or PPC\\" (press +). Oxford University Press. Access date 6 January 2010 .  Properties  = Efficiency = Example: Production-possibilities frontier for an economy with two (groups of) products, showing Pareto efficiency Example: Production-possibilities frontier for an economy with two (groups of) products, showing Pareto and allocative efficiency Production-Possibility Frontier delineates the maximum amount/quantities of outputs (goods/services) an economy can achieve, given fixed resources (factors of production) and fixed technological progress. *Points that lie either on or below the production possibilities frontier/curve are possible/attainable: the quantities can be produced with currently available resources and technology. *Points that lie above the production possibilities frontier/curve are not possible/unattainable because the quantities cannot be produced using currently available resources and technology. *Points that lie strictly below the frontier/curve are inefficient, because the economy can produce more of at least one good without sacrificing the production of any other good, with existing resources and technology. *Points that lie on the frontier/curve are efficient. Points that are unattainable can be achieved through external trade and economic growth. Examples include importations of resources and technology, and the increase in the production of goods and services. Specifically, at all points on the frontier, the economy achieves productive efficiency: no more output of any good can be achieved from the given inputs without sacrificing output of some good. Some productive efficient points are Pareto efficient: impossible to find any trade that will make no consumer worse off. Pareto efficiency is achieved when the marginal rate of transformation (slope of the frontier/opportunity cost of goods) is equal to all consumers' marginal rate of substitution. Similarly, not all Pareto efficient points on the frontier are Allocative efficient. Allocative efficient is only achieved when the economy produces at quantities that match societal preference. A PPF typically takes the form of the curve illustrated above. An economy that is operating on the PPF is said to be efficient, meaning that it would be impossible to produce more of one good without decreasing production of the other good. In contrast, if the economy is operating below the curve, it is said to be operating inefficiently because it could reallocate resources in order to produce more of both goods or some resources such as labor or capital are sitting idle and could be fully employed to produce more of both goods. For example, if one assumes that the economy's available quantities of factors of production do not change over time and that technological progress does not occur, if the economy is operating on the PPF, production of guns would need to be sacrificed to produce more butter. If production is efficient, the economy can choose between combinations (points) on the PPF: B if guns are of interest, C if more butter is needed, D if an equal mix of butter and guns is required. In the PPF, all points on the curve are points of maximum productive efficiency (no more output of any good can be achieved from the given inputs without sacrificing output of some good); all points inside the frontier (such as A) can be produced but are productively inefficient; all points outside the curve (such as X) cannot be produced with the given, existing resources. Not all points on the curve are Pareto efficient, however; only in the case where the marginal rate of transformation is equal to all consumers' marginal rate of substitution and hence equal to the ratio of prices will it be impossible to find any trade that will make no consumer worse off. Any point that lies either on the production possibilities curve or to the left of it is said to be an attainable point: it can be produced with currently available resources. Points that lie to the right of the production possibilities curve are said to be unattainable because they cannot be produced using currently available resources. Points that lie strictly to the left of the curve are said to be inefficient, because existing resources would allow for production of more of at least one good without sacrificing the production of any other good. An efficient point is one that lies on the production possibilities curve. At any such point, more of one good can be produced only by producing less of the other. For an extensive discussion of various types of efficiency measures ( Farrell, Hyperbolic, Directional, Cost, Revenue, Profit, Additive, etc.) and their relationships, see Sickles and Zelenyuk (2019, Chapter 3). = Marginal rate of transformation = Marginal rate of transformation increases when the transition is made from AA to BB. The slope of the production‚Äìpossibility frontier (PPF) at any given point is called the marginal rate of transformation (MRT). The slope defines the rate at which production of one good can be redirected (by reallocation of productive resources) into production of the other. It is also called the (marginal) \\"opportunity cost\\" of a commodity, that is, it is the opportunity cost of X in terms of Y at the margin. It measures how much of good Y is given up for one more unit of good X or vice versa. The shape of a PPF is commonly drawn as concave to the origin to represent increasing opportunity cost with increased output of a good. Thus, MRT increases in absolute size as one moves from the top left of the PPF to the bottom right of the PPF. The marginal rate of transformation can be expressed in terms of either commodity. The marginal opportunity costs of guns in terms of butter is simply the reciprocal of the marginal opportunity cost of butter in terms of guns. If, for example, the (absolute) slope at point BB in the diagram is equal to 2, to produce one more packet of butter, the production of 2 guns must be sacrificed. If at AA, the marginal opportunity cost of butter in terms of guns is equal to 0.25, the sacrifice of one gun could produce four packets of butter, and the opportunity cost of guns in terms of butter is 4.  Shape  The production-possibility frontier can be constructed from the contract curve in an Edgeworth production box diagram of factor intensity. The example used above (which demonstrates increasing opportunity costs, with a curve concave to the origin) is the most common form of PPF. It represents a disparity, in the factor intensities and technologies of the two production sectors. That is, as an economy specializes more and more into one product (such as moving from point B to point D), the opportunity cost of producing that product increases, because we are using more and more resources that are less efficient in producing it. With increasing production of butter, workers from the gun industry will move to it. At first, the least qualified (or most general) gun workers will be transferred into making more butter, and moving these workers has little impact on the opportunity cost of increasing butter production: the loss in gun production will be small. However, the cost of producing successive units of butter will increase as resources that are more and more specialized in gun production are moved into the butter industry. If opportunity costs are constant, a straight-line (linear) PPF is produced. This case reflects a situation where resources are not specialised and can be substituted for each other with no added cost. Products requiring similar resources (bread and pastry, for instance) will have an almost straight PPF and so almost constant opportunity costs. More specifically, with constant returns to scale, there are two opportunities for a linear PPF: if there was only one factor of production to consider or if the factor intensity ratios in the two sectors were constant at all points on the production-possibilities curve. With varying returns to scale, however, it may not be entirely linear in either case. With economies of scale, the PPF would curve inward, with the opportunity cost of one good falling as more of it is produced. Specialization in producing successive units of a good determines its opportunity cost (say from mass production methods or specialization of labor).  Opportunity cost  Increasing butter from A to B carries little opportunity cost, but for C to D the cost is great. From a starting point on the frontier, if there is no increase in productive resources, increasing production of a first good entails decreasing production of a second, because resources must be transferred to the first and away from the second. Points along the curve describe the tradeoff between the goods. The sacrifice in the production of the second good is called the opportunity cost (because increasing production of the first good entails losing the opportunity to produce some amount of the second). Opportunity cost is measured in the number of units of the second good forgone for one or more units of the first good. In the context of a PPF, opportunity cost is directly related to the shape of the curve (see below). If the shape of the PPF curve is a straight-line, the opportunity cost is constant as production of different goods is changing. But, opportunity cost usually will vary depending on the start and end points. In the diagram on the right, producing 10 more packets of butter, at a low level of butter production, costs the loss of 5 guns (shown as a movement from A to B). At point C, the economy is already close to its maximum potential butter output. To produce 10 more packets of butter, 50 guns must be sacrificed (as with a movement from C to D). The ratio of gains to losses is determined by the marginal rate of transformation.'

The main options are interleaved posting (also called inline replying, in which the different parts of the reply follow the relevant parts of the original post), bottom-posting (in which the reply follows the quote) or top- posting (in which the reply precedes the quoted original message). For each of those options, there is also the issue of whether trimming of the original text is allowed, required, or preferred. For a long time the traditional style was to post the answer below as much of the quoted original as was necessary to understand the reply (bottom or inline). Many years later, when email became widespread in business communication, it became a widespread practice to reply above the entire original and leave it (supposedly untouched) below the reply. While each online community differs on which styles are appropriate or acceptable, within some communities the use of the \\"wrong\\" method risks being seen as a breach of netiquette, and can provoke vehement response from community regulars. Quoting previous messages In an e-mail reply, it is sometimes appropriate to include a full or partial copy of the original message that is being replied to. As opposed to in-person conversations and Internet chats, email responses may be received long after the original message was sent, so the original sender may have forgotten, misplaced or deleted the original. Many email reading programs (mail user agents) encourage this behaviour by automatically including a copy of the original message in the reply editing window. Quoted text from previous messages is usually distinguished in some way from the new (reply) text. At a minimum, the two parts are given different indentation. In the example below, the first line is the original message, the second line is the reply: All these words are terrible. They're hurtful and they make no sense. --Mary Much like your posting.--Joe. Alternatively, special delimiter lines may be used: Hey Joe, Paris is in France, not England. --Mary \\\\--- original message --- You just had a call from England, from Paris I think. --Joe \\\\--- end of original message --- For extra clarity, blank lines may also be inserted between the two parts. When using an email medium that supports text markup (such as HTML or RTF), the previous text may be indicated by a distinctive font and/or color: The meeting has been postponed to next Friday. --Mary Has the deadline for the report been moved too? --Joe =Quoted line prefix= Alternative e-mail quoting styles supported by Microsoft Outlook A common convention in plain-text email is to prefix each line of the quoted text with a distinctive character or string. As of 2020 (and for many years previously), the greater-than sign (\\"\`>\`\\", the canonical prefix)R. Gellens (February 2004), RFC 3676 The Text/Plain Format and DelSp Parameters is almost universally used; but other characters such as the ASCII vertical bar character (\\"\`\`\\") have been used as well, sometimes with one or more spaces inserted before or after the quoted text marker. There is no standard declaring one quote-prefix to be \\"right\\" and others to be \\"wrong\\", but some standards depend on conventional quoting. The \\"never issued\\" and obsolete \\"son-of-1036\\" draft RFC 1849 recommends \\"\`>\`\\" as the quote-prefix; RFC 3676 depends on it and considers \\"\`>> \`\\" and \\"\`> > \`\\" to be semantically different. That is, \\"\`>> \`\\" has a quote-depth of two, while \\"\`> > \`\\" has a quote-depth of one, quoting a line starting with \\">\\". Most e-mail clients treat the two sequences as equivalent, however. The convention of quoting was common in Usenet newsgroups by 1990, and is supported by many popular email interfaces, either by default or as a user-settable option. In Microsoft Outlook, for instance, this behavior is controlled by an option labeled \\"Prefix each line of the original\\". Besides inserting markers automatically in quoted lines, some interfaces assume that a line starting with a \\"\`>\`\\" character or similar is quoted text, and will automatically display it in a distinctive font or color: > How is the report coming? --Mary It will be on your desk by noon. --Joe Sometimes the insertion of a quoted line marker will cause one original line to be folded as two lines in the reply, and the continuation line may not have the proper marker. To avoid ambiguity in such cases, one may consider inserting blank lines after each block of quoted text: >The board is asking again for the sales data. We really must provide > them with some figures. How is the report coming? --Mary It will be on your desk by noon. --Joe Quoted line markers are most commonly used in plain-text messages. In HTML messages, other devices may be used to indicate quoted text, such as HTML indentation elements like \`blockquote\` or \`dl\`. =Reply level indication= A message often includes text from two or more messages exchanged in previous rounds of a long discussion. If an additional quotation marker is inserted at every round, without removing any existing markers, the number of markers at the beginning of each line will show the \\"level\\" of the reply, that is, how many rounds have occurred since that line was written. These accumulated markers are usually sufficient to distinguish the parts that came from each message. Some email interfaces recognize this convention and automatically render each level in a different color. For example: >>> How is the report coming? --Mary >> >> It will be on your desk by noon. --Joe > > Sorry Joe, I need it by 11:00 at the latest. --Mary OK, but it will be missing this month's figures. --Joe If the discussion is between two parties only, then an even number of markers (including zero) identifies text written by the sender, while an odd number of markers identifies text by the recipient. (In the above example even numbers are Joe's text and odd numbers are Mary's.) No problem. 6pm it is then. --Jim At 10.01am Wednesday, Danny wrote: > Whoa! I need to email a report at 5:30. > Could you push it back an hour? --Danny > > At 9.40am Wednesday, Jim wrote: > >> I'm going to suspend the mail service for approx. thirty >> minutes tonight, starting at 5pm. --Jim In HTML messages, \`blockquote\` or \`dl\` elements may be nested to achieve the same effect. =Attribution lines= Quoted material is often preceded by an attribution line that identifies its author. These lines are particularly helpful in discussions between multiple parties. For example: Nancy wrote: > Peter wrote: >> When will we have the performance figures? > The tests will be completed next week. Peter wrote: > Mary wrote: >> We should meet today to discuss the marketing strategy. > Better wait, we do not have the West Coast sales data yet. I agree with Peter. We need the sales data and also Nancy's performance figures. Let's meet next Friday after lunch. This reply quotes two messages, one by Nancy (itself a reply to Peter) and one by Peter (itself a reply to Mary). Many mail agents will add these attribution lines automatically to the top of the quoted material. Note that a newly added attribution line should not get the quotation marker, since it is not part of the quoted text; so that the level indicator of the attribution line is always one less than the corresponding text. Doing otherwise may confuse the reader and also e-mail interfaces that choose the text color according to the number of leading markers. Instead of an attribution line, one may indicate the author by a comment in brackets, at the beginning of the quotation: >> [Peter:] When will we have the performance figures? > [Nancy:] The tests will be completed next week. >> [Mary:] We should meet today to discuss the marketing strategy. > [Peter:] Better wait, we do not have the West Coast sales data yet. I agree with Peter. We need the sales data and Nancy's performance figures. Let's meet next Friday after lunch. Another alternative, used in Fidonet and some mail user agents, is to place the initials of the author before the quoting marker. This may be used with or without attribution lines: Nancy wrote: N> Peter wrote: P>> When will we have the performance figures? N> The tests will be completed next week. Peter wrote: P> Mary wrote: M>> We should meet today to discuss the marketing strategy. P> Better wait, we do not have the West Coast sales data yet. I agree with Peter. We need the sales data and also Nancy's performance figures. Let's meet next Friday after lunch. Trimming and reformatting When replying to long discussions, particularly in newsgroup discussions, quoted text from the original message is often trimmed so as to leave only the parts that are relevant to the reply‚Äîor only a reminder thereof. This practice is sometimes called \\"trim-posting\\" or \\"edited posting\\", and is recommended by some manuals of posting etiquette.S. Hambridge (October 1995), Network Working Group RFC 1855 Netiquette Guidelines Sometimes an indicator of deleted text is given, usually in the form of a square bracketed tag as: \\"[snipped]\\", \\"[trimmed]\\", or simply \\"[...]\\". The text that is retained may be edited to some extent, e.g. by re-folding the lines. For example, if the original message was This is a reminder that the project meeting which was canceled last week will be held today in the 3rd floor conference room at 14:30 sharp. Everybody must attend. --Mary the reply may be > the project meeting [...] will be held today in the 3rd floor > conference room Mary, be sure to check the mics in that room. --Joe or even just > 3rd floor conference room Mary, be sure to check the mics in that room. --Joe Deleted text may also be replaced by a summary in brackets: On Thursday, Jim wrote: > The movie clearly adds a sense of menace to the story > which is not present in the original book. > [...claim that the darker tone weakens the movie...] I disagree. The darker tone works well, once one understands the two are aimed at different audiences. Automatically included text (such as signature blocks, free e-mail service ads, and corporate disclaimers) are more likely to be deleted, usually without ellipses, than manually written text. Some posters may delete any parts of the original message that they are not replying to. Some posters delete only parts dealing with issues that they see as \\"closed\\", and leave any parts that, in their opinion, deserve further discussion or will be replied to in a later message. =How much to trim= Some style guides recommend that, as a general rule, quoted material in replies should be trimmed or summarized as much as possible, keeping only the parts that are necessary to make the readers understand the replies. That of course depends on how much the readers can be assumed to know about the discussion. For personal e-mail, in particular, the subject line is often sufficient, and no quoting is necessary; unless one is replying to only some points of a long message. In particular, when replying to a message that already included quoted text, one should consider whether that quoted material is still relevant. For example: >> [Mary:] Shall we meet this afternoon to discuss the >> marketing strategy? > > [Peter:] Perhaps, if we can get all the information we need. > Do we have the West Coast sales data yet? The LA office just sent them in. Joe The quote from Mary's message is relevant to Peter's reply, but not to Joe's reply. The latter could have been trimmed to > [Peter:] Do we have the West Coast sales data yet? The LA office just sent them in. Joe On the other hand, in some situations, any trimming or editing of the original message may be inappropriate. For example, if the reply is being copied to a third person who did not see the original message, it may be advisable to quote it in full; otherwise the trimmed message may be misinterpreted by the new recipient, for lack of context. Also, when replying to a customer or supplier, it may be advisable to quote the original message in its entirety, in case the other party somehow failed to keep a copy of it. Placement of replies = Interleaved style = In the interleaved reply style (also called \\"inline reply\\", \\"interlined reply\\", \\"point-by-point rebuttal\\", or, sometimes, \\"bottom posting\\"), the original message is broken into two or more sections, each followed by a specific reply or comment. A reply in inline style may also include some top-posted or bottom-posted comments that apply to the whole reply message, rather than to a specific point. For example: I have been following the discussion about the new product line. Here are my thoughts. Joe wrote: > Will our prices be competitive? That may not be a problem for now, we still have a quality edge. > We do not have enough trained people on the West Coast. We have many > new employees but they do not know our products yet. We can bring them here for a crash training course. Mary wrote: > We still do not have a clear marketing plan. Peter, would you take charge of that? Let me know if you need help. On the whole, I am quite optimistic. It looks like we will be shipping the basic system before the end of this quarter.

Interleaving was also common originally in e-mail, because many internet users had been exposed to Usenet newsgroups and other Internet forums, where it is still used. The style became less common for email after the opening of the internet to commercial and non-academic personal use. One possible reason is the large number of casual e-mail users that entered the scene at that time. Another possible reason is the inadequate support provided by the reply function of some webmail readers, which either do not automatically insert a copy of the original message into the reply, or do so without any quoting prefix level indicators. Finally, most forums, wiki discussion pages, and blogs (such as Slashdot) essentially impose the bottom- post format, by displaying all recent messages in chronological order.. Interleaving continues to be used on technical mailing lists where clarity within complex threads is important.. =Top-posting= In top-posting style, the original message is included verbatim, with the reply above it. It is sometimes referred to by the acronym TOFU (\\"text over, fullquote under\\"). It has also been colloquially referred to as Jeopardy! reply style: as in the game show's signature clue/response format, the answers precede the question. Example: No problem. 6pm it is then.

Jim Top-posting preserves an apparently unmodified transcript of a branch in the conversation. Often all replies line up in a single branch of a conversation. The top of the text shows the latest replies. This appears to be advantageous for business correspondence, where an e-mail thread can dupe others into believing it is an \\"official\\" record. By contrast, excessive indentation of interleaved and bottom posting may turn difficult to interpret. If the participants have different stature such as manager vs. employee or consultant vs. client, one person's cutting apart another person's words without the full context may look impolite or cause misunderstanding. In the earlier days of Usenet informal discussions where everyone was an equal encouraged bottom-posting. Until the mid-1990s, posts in a net.newcomers newsgroup insisted on interleaving replies. Usenet comp.lang hierarchy, especially comp.lang.c and comp.lang.c++ insisted on the same as of the 2010s. The alt hierarchy tolerated top-posting. Newer online participants, especially those with limited experience of Usenet, tend to be less sensitive to arguments about posting style. Top-posting can be problematic on mailing lists with ongoing discussions which eventually require someone to act on the top-posted material. For example, top-posting \\"Those changes look ok to me, go ahead and make them\\" can be very inconvenient for the person who needs to make the changes if he or she has to read through a long email trail to know which changes the top-poster is referring to. Inter-leaving the text directly below the text describing the changes is much more convenient in these cases. Users of mobile devices, like smartphones, are encouraged to use top-posting because the devices may only download the beginning of a message for viewing. The rest of the message is only retrieved when needed, which takes additional download time. Putting the relevant content at the beginning of the message requires less bandwidth, less time, and less scrolling for the user.My rapidly growing email habit blog post Stopping SirCam ‚Äîpostfix.org mailing listTop Posting and Mobiles‚ÄîJabber mailing list Top-posting is a natural consequence of the behavior of the \\"reply\\" function in many current e-mail readers, such as Microsoft Outlook, Gmail, and others. By default, these programs insert into the reply message a copy of the original message (without headers and often without any extra indentation or quotation markers), and position the editing cursor above it. Moreover, a bug present on most flavours of Microsoft Outlook caused the quotation markers to be lost when replying in plain text to a message that was originally sent in HTML/RTF. For these and possibly other reasons, many users seem to accept top-posting as the \\"standard\\" reply style. Partially because of Microsoft's influence, top-posting is very common on mailing lists and in personal e-mail. Top-posting has always been the standard format for forwarding a message to a third party, in which case the comments at the top (if any) are a \\"cover note\\" for the recipient. =Bottom-posting= In the \\"bottom-posting\\" style, the reply is appended to a full or partial copy of the original message. The name bottom-posting is sometimes used for inline- style replies, and indeed the two formats are the same when only one point is being replied to.

Bottom-posting, like inline replies, encourages posters to trim the original message as much as possible, so that readers are not forced to scroll past irrelevant text, or text that they have already seen in the original message: At 10.01am Wednesday, Danny wrote: > Could you push it back an hour? > [...] which systems will be updated? > [...] Will I have to reboot? No problems. 6pm it is then. Basically, I will update our WWW server and firewall. No, you won't have to reboot. =Choosing the proper posting style= The choice between interleaved, top and bottom posting generally depends on the forum and on the nature of the message. Some forums (such as personal e-mail) are quite tolerant, in which case the proper style is dictated by taste and effectiveness. In any case one should consider whether the reply will be easily read by the intended recipient(s). Their e-mail interfaces may have different rules for handling quoted line markers and long lines, so a reply that looks readable in one's screen may be jumbled and incorrectly colored on theirs. Blank lines and judicious trimming of the original text may help avoid ambiguity. The interleaved reply style can require more work in terms of labeling lines, but possibly less work in establishing the context of each reply line. It also keeps the quotes and their replies close to each other and in logical reading order, and encourages trimming of the quoted material to the bare minimum. This style makes it easier for readers to identify the points of the original message that are being replied to; in particular, whether the reply misunderstood or ignored some point of the original text. It also gives the sender freedom to arrange the quoted parts in any order, and to provide a single comment to quotations from two or more separate messages, even if these did not include each other. Top- and bottom-posting are sometimes compared to traditional written correspondence in that the response is a single continuous text, and the whole original is appended only to clarify which letter is being replied to. Customer service e-mail practices, in particular, often require that all points be addressed in a clear manner without quoting, while the original e-mail message may be included as an attachment. Including the whole original message may be necessary also when a new correspondent is included in an ongoing discussion.Quoting: Top Posting‚ÄîDan's Mail Format SiteSensible email ‚ÄîBlog post and discussion Especially in business correspondence, an entire message thread may need to be forwarded to a third party for handling or discussion. On the other hand, in environments where the entire discussion is accessible to new readers (such as newsgroups or online forums), full inclusion of previous messages is inappropriate; if quoting is necessary, the interleaved style is probably best. If the original message is to be quoted in full, for any reason, bottom-posting is usually the most appropriate format‚Äîbecause it preserves the logical order of the replies and is consistent with the Western reading direction from top to bottom. It is not uncommon during discussions concerning top-posting vs. bottom-posting to hear quotes from \\"Netiquette Guidelines (RFC 1855)\\". While many RFCs are vetted and approved though a committee process, some RFCs, such as RFC 1844, are just \\"Informational\\" and in reality, sometimes just personal opinions. (Additional information on \\"Informational\\" RFCs can be found in RFC 2026, under \\"4.2.2 Informational\\" and \\"4.2.3 Procedures for Experimental and Informational RFCs\\".) The nature of RFC 1855 should be considered while reading the following discussion. According to RFC 1855, a message can begin with an abbreviated summary; i.e. a post can begin with a paraphrasing instead of quoting selectively. Specifically, it says: Interleaved reply combined with top-posting combines the advantages of both styles. However this also results in some portions of the original message being quoted twice, which takes up extra space and may confuse the reader. In forwarding it is sometimes preferred to include the entire original message (including all headers) as a MIME attachment, while in top-posted replies these are often trimmed or replaced by an attribution line. An untrimmed quoted message is a weaker form of transcript, as key pieces of meta information are destroyed. (This is why an ISP's Postmaster will typically insist on a forwarded copy of any problematic e-mail, rather than a quote.) These forwarded messages are displayed in the same way as top-posting in some mail clients. Top-posting is viewed as seriously destructive to mailing-list digests, where multiple levels of top-posting are difficult to skip. The worst case would be top-posting while including an entire digest as the original message. Some believe that \\"top-posting\\" is appropriate for interpersonal e-mail, but inline posting should always be applied to threaded discussions such as newsgroups. This example is occasionally used in mailing lists to mock and discourage top- posting: A: Because it messes up the order in which people normally read text. Q: Why is top-posting such a bad thing? A: Top-posting. Q: What is the most annoying thing in e-mail? Bottom-posting preserves the logical order of the replies and is consistent with the Western reading direction from top to bottom. The major argument against bottom-posting is that scrolling down through a post to find a reply is inconvenient, especially for short replies to long messages, and many inexperienced computer users may not know that they need to scroll down to find a reply to their query. When sending an untrimmed bottom-posted message, one might indicate inline replies with a notice at the top such as \\"I have replied below.\\" However, as many modern mail programs are capable of displaying different levels of quotation with different colors (as seen in the bottom-posting example on this page), this is not so much of an issue any more. Another method to indicate that there is more reply text still to come is to always end your text with a signature line. Then a reader who is familiar with your reply style will know to continue to read until your signature line appears. This method is particularly polite and useful when using the inline reply method, since it tells the reader that your response is complete at the point where your signature line appears. =Quoting support in popular mail clients= This widespread policy in business communication made bottom and inline posting so unknown among most users that some of the most popular email programs no longer support the traditional posting style. For example, Microsoft Outlook, AOL, and Yahoo! make it difficult or impossible to indicate which part of a message is the quoted original or do not let users insert comments between parts of the original. Yahoo! does not have the option \\"Quote the text of the original message\\" in Mail Classic, but this setting is retained after turning it on in All-New Mail and then switching back to Mail Classic. Inline replying is broken in Microsoft Outlook, which despite choosing the setting to prefix each line of the original with the \\"greater- than\\" character (>) produces a blue line that makes answers inserted between quotes of an HTML email look like part of the original. The workarounds are to use the setting \\"read all standard mail in plain text\\", or to use the \\"Edit Message\\" option on the original email and convert it to plain text before replying (then discard the edited version).

Initially, the band's lyrics were primarily concerned with food, before expanding into broader subject matter following the addition of Sean Lennon, Timo Ellis, and Duma Love to the band for their second studio album. While Honda and Hatori are Japanese expatriates, the group initially did not gain as large a following in Japan as it did in the United States. Their first album Viva! La Woman sold 40,000 copies in Japan, but was more successful in the U.S., with over 74,000 copies sold.Bell, Carrie. \\"Warner Bros. Positions Cibo Matto To Break Its 'Stereotype'\\". Billboard: 13. 1 May 1999. Over time, the group's following in Japan grew, which resulted in their signing to Japanese record label Commmons in 2014. After an almost decade-long hiatus, Honda and Hatori reunited as Cibo Matto in 2011, playing a series of concerts and recording new material. They released their third and final studio album Hotel Valentine on February 14, 2014. It peaked at number 168 on the Billboard 200. Cibo Matto announced their split in December 2017. History =Viva! La Woman: 1994‚Äì1996= After working together in the noise rock band Leitoh Lychee, Miho Hatori and Yuka Honda formed Cibo Matto in 1994 with Honda as the instrumentalist and Hatori as the vocalist (although occasionally Honda sang and Hatori contributed instrumentally). In 1995, Cibo Matto released a self titled EP on El Diablo Records. The EP caught the attention of Warner Bros. Records, which signed Cibo Matto later in the year. Through Warner Bros. the duo released its first major album, Viva! La Woman. Cibo Matto is an Italian phrase that translates to \\"Crazy Food\\" and many of the tracks from Viva! La Woman, which was produced by Mitchell Froom, featured lyrics related to food, including \\"Know Your Chicken\\", \\"Apple\\", and \\"Birthday Cake\\". The album's first single, \\"Sugar Water\\", was a modest college radio and dance hit. The song was accompanied by an innovative split screen music video that was directed by Michel Gondry, where each side showed the same footage‚Äîone side going forward, and one backward, meeting mid-song. After the music videos for \\"Know Your Chicken\\" and \\"Sugar Water\\" enjoyed success on MTV, Cibo Matto made appearances on various television shows such as Oddville, Viva Variety, and Buffy the Vampire Slayer. \\"Birthday Cake\\" was heavily featured in the video game Jet Set Radio Future. in 1996, Cibo Matto contributed \\"√Åguas De Mar√ßo (Waters of March)\\" to the AIDS benefit album Silencio=Muerte: Red Hot + Latin, which was produced by the Red Hot Organization. =Stereo ‚òÖ Type A: 1997‚Äì2001= In 1997, Cibo Matto released a new EP entitled Super Relax, which would complete the line-up by introducing new members Sean Lennon and Timo Ellis with Duma Love joining soon thereafter. In 1998 Lennon released his debut solo album Into the Sun, which featured Hatori (\\"Into the Sun\\", \\"Sean's Theme\\") and Ellis (\\"Mystery Juice\\", \\"Home\\", \\"Spaceship\\"). Into the Sun was produced and inspired by Honda (whom Lennon was dating at the time).HILBURN, ROBERT. \\"Q & A: Sean Lennon; Karma Boy\\". Los Angeles Times. 18 May 1998. Honda, Hatori, Ellis and Love appeared in the closing scene of the video for Lennon's single \\"Home\\". Cibo Matto went on to release its second album Stereo ‚òÖ Type A in 1999. Although it was a departure from the familiar sound of Viva! La Woman, Stereo ‚òÖ Type A was well received by music critics. That year the band performed in Toronto with Luscious Jackson at The Opera House in Toronto.\\"Live Reviews: Luscious Jackson/Cibo Matto August 1, 1999 The Opera House, Toronto\\". Chart Attack, Sher Martelle, August 1, 1999 =Hiatus: 2002‚Äì2010= Cibo Matto continued to play live and tour until disbanding in 2002. Honda said: \\"We felt the need to move to the next step. It was a healthy decision, though it was sad at the same time. Things just need to grow out of things sometimes.\\" All of the members of Cibo Matto went on to release solo material. A compilation entitled Pom Pom: The Essential Cibo Matto was released in 2007. =Reunion and Hotel Valentine: 2011‚Äì2017= Cibo Matto announced its reunion on March 18, 2011, to perform as part of a benefit concert for victims of the 2011 T≈çhoku earthquake and tsunami. The concert, which took place on March 27 at Columbia University in New York City, also included Yoko Ono, John Zorn, Sonic Youth, and Mike Patton. Following the success of this show, a second was added, this time featuring the Plastic Ono Band and Patti Smith along with Cibo Matto. The group appeared at the Hollywood Bowl on June 26, 2011, for another benefit, alongside Yellow Magic Orchestra. On May 16, 2011, Cibo Matto announced its US reunion tour titled \\"Yeah, Basically Cibo Matto\\" with a tour Web site Wayback Machine and promotional video. During the concerts, the band reportedly spoke about a new studio album that was to be released in 2012. On July 17, 2012, the band announced it would be opening for Wilco at one of its shows. The band included Yuko Araki on drums during this time. On June 15, 2013, the band played the Meltdown Festival in London and announced that its new album would be released in 2014. While the performance also featured Yoko Ono on \\"Know Your Chicken\\", the group also played new songs titled \\"MFN\\", \\"Check In\\", and \\"Tenth Floor Ghost Girl\\". On December 11, Pitchfork reported that Hotel Valentine would be released on February 14, 2014 (Valentine's Day), and that Cibo Matto had shared its music video for \\"MFN\\". Hotel Valentine peaked at number 168 on the Billboard 200. In 2014, the band signed with Japanese label Commmons. This new relationship resulted in several live dates in Japan including Summer Sonic Festival 2014 and shows at Blue Note Jazz Club Nagoya and Blue Note Jazz Club Tokyo. In September 2014, Cibo Matto announced their Fall Flavor Tour and the release of their newest music video with a teaser. Rioux opened for multiple US shows. Nels Cline (of Wilco) also performed with the group on tour. The music video for \\"D√©j√† Vu\\" was released on September 18, 2014 in collaboration with New York City-based director Jean Claude Billmaier and creative house Marabigo. Pitchfork identified the video as \\"a colorful, datamosh-y new video\\", and Spin as a \\"stylish bubblegum pop-meets-digital- disaster (intentional).\\" Cibo Matto completed two small tours in 2015; an \\"Avocado Tour\\" of Japan and a \\"Banana Split Tour\\" across the eastern US and Canada. On December 11, 2017, Cibo Matto announced their breakup.

At the age of twenty-one, he wrote to the President of the University of North Carolina, where he was a member of the Dialectic and Philanthropic Societies and Phi Gamma Delta fraternity, former Governor David L. Swain, and asked for a loan so that he could attend law school. Governor Swain arranged for a $300 loan from the university, and Vance performed admirably. By 1852 Vance began practicing law in Asheville, and was soon elected county solicitor (prosecuting attorney). By 1853, he married Harriette Espy at Quaker Meadows. They had five sons, four of whom survived to adulthood. Civil War Vance in the Civil War By the time the ordinance of secession had passed in May 1861, Vance was a captain stationed in Raleigh, commanding a company known as the \\"Rough and Ready Guards\\", part of the Fourteenth North Carolina Regiment. That August, Vance was elected Colonel of the Twenty-sixth North Carolina. The Twenty-sixth engaged in the Battle of New Bern in March 1862, where Vance conducted an orderly retreat. Vance also led the Twenty-sixth at Richmond. The Twenty-sixth was ultimately destroyed at the Battle of Gettysburg, losing more than 700 of its original 800 members, though Vance at that time was no longer in military service. In September 1862, Vance won the gubernatorial election. In the Confederacy Vance was a major proponent of individual rights and local self-government, often putting him at odds with the Confederate government of Jefferson Davis. For example, North Carolina was the only state to observe the right of habeas corpus and keep its courts fully functional during the war. Vance opposed Confederate conscription practices; postwar, he would even testify in the hearing investigating George Pickett's execution of 22 alleged Confederate deserters in the aftermath of the Battle of New Bern (1864). Vance testified that the North Carolinians were \\"troops raised for local defense\\" and that \\"the Confederate government did not keep faith with these local troops,\\" who were \\"transfer[red] to the regular service\\" in \\"violation of their enlistment agreement.\\" This testimony questioned the legality of Pickett's decision to hang as deserters the North Carolinians found fighting for the Union troops, and put Pickett at risk of prosecution for war crimes. Vance also refused to allow supplies smuggled into North Carolina by blockade runners to be given to other states until North Carolinians had their share. Vance's work for the aid and morale of the people inspired the nickname \\"War Governor of the South\\". Vance was re-elected in 1864. On May 29, 1865, William Woods Holden was appointed governor by President Andrew Johnson.Presidential Proclamation No. 38, May 29, 1865, Some have said that when Vance left Raleigh when it was captured by Sherman at the end of the Civil War, that the house where he temporarily lived in Statesville was a \\"temporary state capitol,\\" but it is more accurately argued that there is no evidence that he conducted official business in Statesville, and that Gov. Holden believed that once Vance left Raleigh, he relinquished the office of governor.http://michaelchardy.blogspot.com/2015/05/statesville-last-north- carolina-state.htmlhttp://www.statesville.com/news/museum-holding-civil-war- living-history-day/article_ec7381a8-c133-11e3-aca6-0017a43b2370.html Post- war career Governor Vance was arrested by Federal forces on his birthday in May 1865 and spent time in prison in Washington, D.C. Per US President Andrew Johnson's amnesty program, he filed an application for pardon on June 3, and was paroled on July 6.Zebulon Baird Vance, 13 May 1830-14 Apr. 1894. Docsouth.unc.edu. Retrieved on April 3, 2012. After his parole, he began practicing law in Charlotte, North Carolina. Among his clients was accused murderer Tom Dula, the subject of the folk song \\"Tom Dooley.\\" Governor Vance was formally pardoned on March 11, 1867, though no formal charges had ever been filed against him before his arrest, during his imprisonment, nor during the period of his parole. In 1870, the state legislature elected him to the United States Senate, but due to the restrictions placed on ex-Confederates by the 14th Amendment , he was not allowed to serve. In 1876, Vance was elected Governor once again (during which time he focused on education), and in 1879 the legislature again elected him to the United States Senate. This time he was seated, and he served in the Senate until his death in 1894. In the Senate, he opposed McKinley tariff, civil service programs, and repeal of the Sherman Silver Purchase Act. He generally supported conservative President Grover Cleveland, and back in North Carolina fought the populists and Farmers Alliance.Leonard C. Schlup, and James Gilbert Ryan, eds. Historical dictionary of the Gilded Age (2003) p 511. Starting in about 1870, Vance gave a speech hundreds of times he called \\"The Scattered Nation\\", praising Jews and calling for religious tolerance and freedom amongst all Americans.

As ages to come will not be able to mar the grandeur and greatness of Mount Mitchell, so they will not be able to efface from the hearts and minds of the people the name of their beloved Vance. His biographer, historian Selig Adler wrote: :As war governor, Vance endeared himself forever to his people.

He grew up in Brooklyn, New York, and after a six-year stint in New Hampshire, later moved to California. Programs developed partially or entirely under his direction include WordStar, HelpDesk, Quattro Pro, and WebSleuth, among others. WordStar was the first truly successful program for the personal computer (in a commercial sense) and gave reasonably priced access to word processing for the general population for the first time. Rubinstein began his involvement with microcomputers as director of marketing at IMSAI.  Early career  During his teenage years, Rubinstein was a television repairman. After his military service he became a technical writer and continued his undergraduate studies at night. In 1964, he was given the opportunity to participate in the design and implementation a classified system for identifying unknown vessels at sea by their sound fingerprint. Following his success with this and other related projects, he moved to New Hampshire to be put in charge of the computer software development for a line of IBM compatible programmable CRT terminals. As part of this assignment, Rubinstein went to San Francisco. Two years later, Rubinstein moved to the Bay Area and landed an assignment to implement a law office management system on a Varian Data Machines minicomputer. Following this, he formed the Systems Division of Prodata International Corporation which was subsequently acquired by Varian Data Machines. As a consequence, Rubinstein temporarily moved to Z√ºrich, Switzerland to utilize the technology he developed as part of a branch banking system for Credit Suisse. Upon his return to California, he visited the Byte Shop of San Rafael and began his love affair with the microcomputer.  Business ventures  Rubinstein founded MicroPro International Inc., in June 1978. Subsequently, Rubinstein made an arrangement with Rob Barnaby, a programmer Rubinstein met at IMSAI. While at IMSAI, Barnaby wrote a screen editor which was called NED. Rubinstein had Barnaby totally rewrite NED into a new product, WordMaster. MicroPro was officially launched in September, 1978 using Barnaby‚Äôs first two programs, WordMaster and SuperSort. Feedback from the computer store dealers, who were MicroPro‚Äôs first customers, said they wanted a program with integrated printing. Rubinstein developed the specifications for the new program including many innovations unavailable in commercial word processing at the time, such as showing page breaks, providing an integrated help system and a keyboard design specifically for touch typists. Barnaby did the initial foundation for MailMerge, which was finished by others. In mid-1979 was born the Wordstar word processor. A year and a half later, several IMSAI employees joined Rubinstein at Micropro, including Bruce Van Natta, A. Joseph \\"Joe\\" Killian, Dianne Hajicek, and Glenn Ewing. In 1982, WordStar was ported to DOS. > \\"So while WordMaster, SuperSort, and WordStar were developed on IMSAIs (I > used mine til I got an IBM PC), few customers used them.\\" > \\\\-- Rob Barnaby in email to Mike Petrie 2 May 2000 In 1987 Rubinstein became involved with a spreadsheet he called Surpass. This spreadsheet was later sold to Borland International, which renamed it Quattro Pro. In 1990 Rubinstein was sued by Bill Millard, former CEO of IMSAI, regarding theft of trade secrets regarding WordStar. Rubinstein was successfully defended by Davis Wright Tremaine . In a Video History Interview with David Allison of the Smithsonian Institution, Bill Gates referred to Rubinstein as starting one of the first software companies . In 1992 he founded UDICO Holdings, a company which, using a \\"surveillance engine\\" licensed from a French company, sought to create an interactive context sensitive help engine which would intercept \\"F1\\" calls for help within Microsoft Word and direct users at that point to an interactive training session for the feature which they sought help with. Though this product (Developed by T. Lindgren and A. Bennedsen) was never released, the company did release a WinHelp authoring tool called W.Y.S.I. Help Composer. In 1995 he founded a company called Prompt Software to investigate document management, internet research, and worked with Garnet R. Chaney to patent a series of discoveries regarding Content Discovery. This software connected to multiple search sites and used complex word algorithms to refine searches.  Improper credit  Similar to many early pioneers in the software industry, Rubinstein is sometimes credited with writing the software that his companies have marketed. Some things Rubinstein is improperly credited with are: *Developing a BASIC compiler . The real BASIC compilers of the day were MBasic -- Bill Gates' big success -- and CBASIC by Gordon Eubanks. Rubinstein never had any involvement with a BASIC compiler. He was a COBOL man at that time. *Developing WordStar -- The code was written by Rob Barnaby, who originally wrote a screen editor for IMSAI called NuEDit, (or NED). However, no part of the NED source code was used to develop a MicroPro program named WordMaster. The features that turned WordMaster (a programming editor, similar to vi in some ways) into WordStar, the common man's word processor, were mostly Rubinstein's. > \\"Seymour was the marketing brains -- it was he that said we should address > word processing to get a larger market. The defining change was to add > margins and word wrap. Additional changes included getting rid of command > mode and adding a print function. I was the technical brains -- I figured > out how to do it, and did it, and documented it. The product's success I > think related both to it being the right product (Seymour) and to it being a > fairly good implementation given the equipment (me).\\" > \\\\-- Rob Barnaby in email to Mike Petrie 3 May 2000 *Developing Quattro Pro -- The original Quattro Pro was a DOS program. The development environment, a Modula-2 compiler and a windowing system and a crude spreadsheet, were developed in Texas by a company started by Bob Warfield. Rubinstein bought that program and hired the developers and brought on Bob Richardson, former chief programmer at MicroPro to work on the compiler. Surpass (the program name) was developed in Novato, California by Bob Warfield, Dave Anderson, Weikuo Liaw, and Bob Richardson. Barnaby, from the WordStar days did a minor amount of work, as did Jim Fox. Surpass was developed by Surpass Software Systems and at one time was a major spreadsheet competitor as measured by P.C. Magazine. Surpass got great benchmarks and was popular, but due to a bad marketing division was never widely sold. Ingram was given an exclusive on the program but never sold it because Lotus was a major source of income for them. Surpass did not have the money to sue. Quattro was developed by Borland at about the same time sold considerably more units than Surpass and was probably profitable for Borland, but both products were clearly far behind the market leader Lotus. Phillipe Kahn saw the chance to double the development team and get some new technology ideas by buying the Surpass product at a bargain rate, giving him another shot at gaining the lead. So the entire operation was sold to Borland who moved the development to Santa Cruz and Scott's Valley. The Surpass codebase was converted to C and merged with existing Borland code from Quattro to form Quattro Pro, an extremely popular program, although the features such as Hot Links were largely first implemented in Surpass. *Developing WebSleuth -- A widely used metasearch software for Windows 98. The actual code was written by Garnet R. Chaney and Bob Richardson (formerly of WordStar and Quattro Pro) with two weeks support from Karl Dukes and the team from Mediahut (Nottingham UK) with some interface re-design and installation improvements. This company suffered from a lack of funding. The marketing effort was spearheaded by Penelope Lamars. The product is still being developed by a new company called Intesoft Systems. Rubinstein is a principal in the new company. References  External links  * , personal * Oral history interview with Seymour Rubenstein, Charles Babbage Institute.

They are so named because their shape resembles that of a centaur: i.e., highly asymmetric. If some versions of string theory are correct, then high-energy cosmic rays could create black holes when they collide with molecules in the Earth's atmosphere. These black holes would be tiny, with a mass of around 10 micrograms. They would also be unstable enough to explode in a burst of particles within around 10‚àí27 seconds. Theodore Tomaras, a physicist at the University of Crete in Heraklion, Greece, and his Russian collaborators hypothesize that these miniature black holes could explain certain anomalous observations made by cosmic-ray detectors in the Bolivian Andes and on a mountain in Tajikistan. In 1972, the Andean detector registered a cascade that was strangely rich in charged, quark-based particles; far more particles were detected in the bottom portion of the detector than in the top portion. In years since, the detectors in Bolivia and Tajikistan have detected more than 40 Centauro events. Various explanations have been suggested. One possible explanation might be if the strong force between particles behaves unusually when they have extremely high energies. Exploding black holes are also a possibility. The team calculated what signal a detector would register if a cosmic ray creates a miniature black hole that explodes nearby. The researchers' prediction is consistent with the observed Centauro events. The Tomaras team hopes that computer simulations of mini-black holes exploding, and further observations, will solve the puzzle.  Solution to the Centauro puzzle  In 2003 an international team of researches from Russia and Japan found out that the mysterious observation from mountain-top cosmic ray experiments can be explained with conventional physics. The new analysis of Centauro I reveals that there is a difference in the arrival angle between the upper block and lower block events, so the two are not products of the same interaction. That leaves only the lower chamber data connected to the Centauro I event. In other words, the man-horse analogy becomes redundant. There is only an obvious \\"tail\\", and no \\"head\\". The original detector setup had gaps between neighboring blocks in the upper chamber. Linear dimensions of gaps were comparable to the geometrical size of the event. The signal observed in the lower detector was similar to an ordinary interaction occurred at low altitude above the chamber, thus providing a natural solution: passing of a cascade of particles through a gap between the upper blocks. In 2005 it was shown that \\"other Centauro events\\" can be explained by peculiarities of the Chacaltaya detector. So-called \\"exotic signal\\" observed so far in cosmic ray experiments using a traditional X-ray emulsion chamber detector can be consistently explained within the framework of standard physics. The authors of the new analysis firmly believe that the behavior of Nature is more complex than people imagined. Nevertheless, in present case, mundane explanation without any exotic guesswork provides an answer.

A zemstvo (, plural zemstva ‚Äì )The word derives from –∑–µ–º–ª—è (zemly√°), \\"land\\", \\"country\\", \\"state\\"). was an institution of local government set up during the great emancipation reform of 1861 carried out in Imperial Russia by Emperor Alexander II of Russia. Nikolay Milyutin elaborated the idea of the zemstva, and the first zemstvo laws went into effect in 1864. After the October Revolution the zemstvo system was shut down by the Bolsheviks and replaced with a multilevel system of workers' and peasants' councils (\\"soviets\\"). Structure The system of local self-government in the Russian Empire was represented at the lowest level by the mir and the volost and was continued, so far as the 34 Guberniyas (governorates) of old Russia were concerned, in the elective district and provincial assemblies (zemstvo). The goal of the zemstvo reform was the creation of local organs of self-government on an elected basis, possessing sufficient authority and independence to resolve local economic problems. Alexander II instituted these bodies, one for each district and another for each province or government, in 1864. They consisted of a representative council (zemskoye sobranye) and of an executive board (zemskaya uprava) nominated by the former. The board consisted of five classes of members: * large landed proprietors [nobles owning and over], who sat in person * delegates of the small landowners, including the clergy in their capacity of landed proprietors * delegates of the wealthier townsmen * delegates of the less wealthy urban classes * delegates of the peasants, elected by the volostsBy the law of 12 (25) June 1890 the peasant members of the zemstvos were to be nominated by the governor of the government or province from a list elected by the volosts. The nobles received more weight in voting for a zemstvo, as evidenced by the fact that 74% of the zemstvo members were nobles, even though nobles were a tiny minority of the population. Even so, the zemstvo allowed the greater population to have a say in how a small part of their communities would operate. In 1865 zemstvos were opened in nineteen provinces, and between 1866 and 1876 another sixteen were established. Twelve provinces had no zemstvos, the three Baltic provinces and the nine western governments annexed from Poland by Catherine II.Terence Emmons, Wayne S. Vucinich, The Zemstvo in Russia: An Experiment in Local Self- Government (Cambridge University Press, 2011) p34. Created in 1875 after much consultation with Cossack officials, the Zemstvos of the Don Host Oblast collapsed and were abolished after six years of operation. The rules governing elections to the zemstvos were taken as a model for the electoral law of 1906 and are sufficiently indicated by the account of this given below. The zemstvos were originally given large powers in relation to the incidence of taxation and such questions as education, medical relief, public welfare, food supply, and road maintenance in their localities, but radicals, such as the Socialist Revolutionary Party and the nihilists, met them with hostility, believing that the reforms were too minor. These powers were, however, severely restricted by Alexander III (law of ); the zemstvos were then subordinated to the governors, whose consent was necessary for each decision. The governors had drastic powers of discipline over the members. Despite all these restrictions, during the 50 years of the zemstvos, they succeeded in solving many problems of general education, public medical service, construction and maintenance of roads and sponsoring local economic development. The Zemstva hired professional experts from the Intelligentsia in aid of their activity, who came to be known as the 'third element'. Zemstvo expenditure grew from 89.1 million rubles in 1900 to 290.5 million rubles in 1913. Of the latter sum, 90.1 million rubles were spent on education, 71.4 million on medical assistance, 22.2 million on improvements in agriculture, and 8 million on veterinary measures. The chief sources of zemstvo revenue were rates on lands, forests, country dwellings, factories, mines and other real-estate. RUSSIA, U.S.S.R. A Complete Handbook. 1933. Edited by P. Malevsky-Malevich. p. 500. Philately uses the term zemstvo stamp to refer to local-issue Russian postage stamps from this period. All-Russian Zemstvo Union The All-Russian Zemstvo Union was set up in August 1914 to provide a common voice for all the Zemstvos. It was a liberal organisation which after 1915 operated in conjunction with the Union of Cities.

Gygax originally wrote the novels and short stories to promote his World of Greyhawk campaign setting for the Dungeons & Dragons role-playing game. After he left TSR, Gygax continued to write Gord the Rogue novels for several years. In all of these works, the plot revolves around the adventures of a young man named Gord who rises from humble origins in the slums of a large city on the planet Oerth to become a powerful force trying to stave off the takeover of Oerth by demons. Publication history One of the factors that contributed to the success of the Dragonlance setting when it was published in 1984 was a popular series of concurrent novels by Tracy Hickman and Margaret Weis. Gary Gygax, the developer of the World of Greyhawk campaign setting, realized that novels set in Greyhawk could have a similar benefit for his recently published World of Greyhawk boxed set, so he wrote Saga of Old City, the first in a series of novels that would be published under the banner Greyhawk Adventures. The protagonist was Gord the Rogue, and this first novel told of his rise from the Slum Quarter of the city of Greyhawk to become world traveller and thief extraordinaire. The novel was designed to promote sales of the boxed set by providing colourful details about the social customs and peoples of various cities and countries in a region called the Flanaess. Even before Saga of Old City rolled off the presses in November 1985, Gygax wrote a sequel, Artifact of Evil. He also wrote a short story, \\"At Moonset Blackcat Comes\\", that appeared in the special 100th issue of Dragon magazine in August 1985. This introduced Gord the Rogue to gamers just before Saga of Old City was scheduled to be released.] However, at the same time, various factions within TSR with different visions of the company's future caused a power struggle, and Gygax was forced out on December 31, 1985. By the terms of his settlement with TSR, Gygax kept the rights to Gord the Rogue as well as all D&D; characters whose names were anagrams or plays on his own name (for example, Yrag and Zagyg).Gygax: \\"Anagrams of my name are exclusively my property according to my settlement agreement with TSR, so that is how I can use Zagyg, or Zagig, as well as Yrag.\\" After Gygax left TSR in 1985, he continued to write a few more Gord the Rogue novels, which were published by New Infinities Productions: Sea of Death (1987), Night Arrant (1987), City of Hawks (1987), Come Endless Darkness (1988), and Dance of Demons (1988). In Gygax's absence, however, TSR moved the Greyhawk storyline in new directions that Gygax didn't appreciate, and the line of Greyhawk Adventures novels (without Gord the Rogue) continued to be written by Rose Estes. In a literary declaration that his old world of Oerth was dead, and wanting to make a clean break with all things Greyhawk and D&D;, Gygax destroyed his version of Oerth in the final Gord the Rogue novel, Dance of Demons.Q: \\"After you left TSR, you finished the Gord the Rogue books. At the end of the cycle, Oerth bites the bullet. Was this your way of saying that Greyhawk is dead and that fans should turn away from TSR's version with disdain?\\" Gygax: \\"More my way of saying that since T$R had killed the setting with trash releases, it was time to wipe out the shame by obliterating the setting.\\" Series overview The series of novels follows the progress of the orphan beggar Gord, from his lowly youth to his ascension as an avatar of Balance. Gord begins his career with less than heroic motives, but early mentors Gellor the bard and druid Curley Greenleaf continually steer him toward honorable ends. Eventually Gord is revealed to have a kinship with an enigmatic deity named the Catlord. The series, originally designed to provide some social and descriptive details about Gygax's Greyhawk campaign world that he had not been able to fit into the limited space of either the 1980 folio edition or the 1983 boxed set, were written in a pulp swords and sorcery style reminiscent of Fritz Leiber's Fafhrd and the Gray Mouser short stories. Gygax, who believed D&D; would always only appeal to a male demographic,Gygax: As I have often said, I am a biological determinist, and there is no question that male and female brains are different. It is apparent to me that by and large females do not derive the same inner satisfaction from playing games as a hobby that males do. It isn't that females can't play games well, it is just that it isn't a compelling activity to them as is the case for males. wrote the novels for that readership. =Individual novels= Saga of Old City was the first novel in TSR's Greyhawk Adventures series. It starts in Gord's childhood, and ends with his triumphant return to Greyhawk City as a young man and master thief. He learns his trade in the \\"beggars' guild\\", and gets involved in the gang war touched off by the beggars encroaching on the official thieves' guild's territory. He travels and has a variety of swashbuckling adventures, ranging from participating in a war to liberating a young noblewoman held hostage. Artifact of Evil is a continuation of Saga of Old City. This was the final novel under TSR's Greyhawk Adventures banner that was written by Gygax. An ancient artifact is uncovered, whose power could destroy their world. It is up to Gord and his companions to try to stop this artifact of evil from falling into the wrong hands. Sea of Death, the first of the series published by New Infinities Productions, Inc., has Gord traveling far afield to the Sea of Dust, on a quest for a \\"Theorpart\\", hidden in a lost city. He must face rivals sent by demon lords: the psychopathic dwarf Obmi, who serves Zuggtmoy, and the drow priestess Eclavdra, serving Graz'zt. He meets and falls in love with Leda, a clone of Eclavdra. Leda and Gord part at the end of the book as she returns to the Abyss, impersonating Eclavdra in Graz'zt's service for the sake of higher ideals. Night Arrant is a collection of nine short stories about Gord's adventures, in his early twenties, in the City of Greyhawk. City of Hawks is a retelling of the events that occurred in Saga of Old City. Gord's rise from simple beggar to master thief are detailed, as is his search for his true heritage. Come Endless Darkness continues where Sea of Death left off and has Gord continue his quest to stop Tharizdun and Lord Entropy from taking over the Multiverse. Dance of Demons is the finale, in which Gord and Gellor enter the Abyss on a mission from the world's most powerful forces of Balance, to retrieve the remaining Theorparts. The goal is nothing less than to free Tharizdun, the long-imprisoned god of ultimate evil and entropy, and to finally destroy him. The novel ends with the complete destruction of Oerth, and the unveiling of a new and better world. =Uncollected short stories= \\"At Moonset Blackcat Comes\\" is an early tale of Gord and his friend Chert the barbarian, in which Gord accepts a mission for the Catlord. \\"Evening Odds\\" appears as story 14 in Pawn of Chaos: Tales of the Eternal Champion, an anthology of fiction inspired by Michael Moorcock's Eternal Champion mythos. The story takes place some time after the events of Dance of Demons. Gord has apparently been deposed from his position as the new Catlord and is traveling the alternate realities as a Champion of Balance. In the course of the story he upsets a plot by the archfiend Baphomet on modern Earth. \\"The Return of Gord\\" is a caper story set during Gord's days as a master thief in the City of Greyhawk, and \\"A Wizard's Thief\\" is another caper story, involving Gord and Chert, and set in an unnamed city.

She is best known for writing The Hand that Signed the Paper, a novel about a Ukrainian family who collaborated with the Nazis in the Holocaust, under the pseudonym Helen Demidenko. A daughter of British immigrants, Darville was educated at Redeemer Lutheran College in Rochedale, a suburb of Brisbane. While studying English literature at the University of Queensland, she wrote The Hand that Signed the Paper. In 1993, the novel won The Australian/Vogel Literary Award for an unpublished manuscript. Dale published her book in 1994 and won the Miles Franklin Award, becoming the award's youngest winner. The following year, she was the subject of a major Australian literary controversy because she had falsely claimed Ukrainian ancestry as part of the basis of the book (and her pseudonym). The misrepresentation has been described as a \\"literary hoax\\" in The Sydney Morning Herald. The novel was subsequently reissued under her legal name, then Helen Darville. It won the 1995 Australian Literary Society Gold Medal. After teaching, Dale returned to university, gaining her law degree in 2002. She later did post-graduate law study at Oxford and completed an LLB degree in 2012 at the University of Edinburgh. She returned to Australia and became a senior adviser to David Leyonhjelm, a Liberal Democrat member of the Australian Senate, but at the end of May 2016 Leyonhjelm revealed that Dale had left his employ. Early life A daughter of British immigrants, Darville was educated at Redeemer Lutheran College in Rochedale, a suburb of Brisbane. She had previously claimed that her father was Ukrainian, and her mother was Irish. The Hand that Signed the Paper: Novel and controversy While studying English literature at the University of Queensland, she wrote The Hand that Signed the Paper, a novel about a Ukrainian family who collaborated with the Nazis in the Holocaust. In 1993, the novel won The Australian Vogel Literary Award for an unpublished manuscript. =Contents= The novel tells the story of a Ukrainian family trying to survive a decade of Stalinist purges and state-imposed poverty and famine. The family comprises the parents, a daughter, and two sons. They suffer abuse by the drunken local commissar and are refused treatment by the village doctor and his wife (a secular Jew). Many Ukrainians hail the German invaders as liberators from Soviet oppression. Many volunteered for the German armed forces--Wehrmacht, SS, and Ordnungspolizei. The novel stresses the arbitrariness of the assignments to military units. A Ukrainian could as easily end up fighting on the front alongside the Wehrmacht as be in a death squad. The two young brothers are separated in military assignments: 16-year- old Evheny to Nazi Einsatzgruppen C (a mobile killing squad) and the elder 19-year-old Vitaly to the SS training facility for Ukrainians at Trawniki in Poland. Evheny is implicated in the massacre at Babi Yar outside Kiev, while Vitaly is posted to Treblinka extermination camp as a guard. Evheny is later sent to a front-line Waffen SS formation on the Eastern Front, while Vitaly is posted to northern Italy. He is part of German anti-partisan activity in the wake of Italy's withdrawal from the Axis alliance. =Style= The novel is told primarily from the point of view of Kateryna, sister of the two brothers, and Magda, Vitaly's common-law wife from the Polish village near the Treblinka extermination camp. Kateryna has a relationship with a German SS Hauptsturmf√ºhrer. Magda assists a Jewish prisoner to escape after the Treblinka prisoner revolt in August 1943. The family's story is gradually revealed by Fiona, Evheny's Australian-born daughter, who starts investigating the past after her uncle Vitaly is charged in the early 1990s with war crimes in World War II. The book is frank about the anti-semitism of its major characters (who blame Jews for the excesses of Communism), and Darville represented the lives of Ukrainian military men in a sympathetic manner, rather than featuring their victims as is more usual in Holocaust literature. These elements attracted accusations of anti-semitism and condemnation of the book by leaders of Australia's Jewish community. There was a perception that the attitudes of the author \\"Helen Demidenko\\" may have been informed by her Ukrainian ethnic identity, until her pseudonym was revealed along with her false representation of the book as history. =Controversy= The Hand that Signed the Paper won the Miles Franklin Award, one of the most prestigious literary awards in Australia. At the time, the media discovered Helen Dale's identity and legal name. This promoted much debate on the nature of identity, ethnicity, and authenticity in Australian literature. Despite the adverse publicity for the author, the novel won the 1995 Australian Literary Society Gold Medal. When Dale submitted her novel to the University of Queensland Press in 1993, she said it was based upon recorded interviews with her own relatives, among others her uncle \\"Vitaly Demidenko\\". After the awards, the Sydney Morning Herald mistakenly reported in 2005 that the novel had been submitted as a non-fiction book. The author's 1993 note accompanying her manuscript had read: \\"The things narrated in this book really happened, the things they did [are] historical actualities.\\" Then Dale wrote that she was presenting her book as fiction, saying: \\"But this is also a work of fiction. I have presented it as fiction....\\" =Books that discuss the scandal= The controversy that surrounded The Hand that Signed the Paper inspired the publication in 1996 of two books that assessed the novel and issues of authenticity: Robert Manne's The Culture of Forgetting: Helen Demidenko and the Holocaust and Andrew Riemer's The Demidenko Debate. Manne is very critical of Darville's book. Riemer is not, believing her approach was consistent with fiction, even if she tried to exaggerate the specific historic basis of her work. Later work and recent years In 1995, Darville published a short story, \\"Pieces of the Puzzle\\", in the Australian culture journal Meanjin. The byline was 'Demidenko', although the journal noted that the author had \\"taken back\\" her legal name of Darville. She has said that she had met Ukrainian witnesses to the war and the Holocaust, and based the story on their accounts. The Simon Wiesenthal Center wrote to her demanding that she identify these possible war criminals. Dale was briefly a columnist with the Brisbane daily newspaper The Courier-Mail. She was dismissed for accusations of plagiarism after repeating jokes originally from the 'Evil Overlord List' in one of her columns and passing them off as her own. She continued to write freelance features for other News Corporation newspapers and magazines, and occasionally the Fairfax press. In 2017, an investigation by BuzzFeed revealed that Dale had also plagiarised a number of social media posts in her Twitter and Facebook feeds. BuzzFeed asked Dale why she had been lifting the tweets. She replied over Twitter direct message: \\"Cos it's amusing and I don't like Twitter. And don't you have more important stuff to be writing about?\\" In 2000, Darville was again accused of anti-semitism after interviewing David Irving, a Holocaust denier, for Australian Style magazine during his libel trial in London. (It was decided against him). She wrote a post-September 11 article in The Sydney Morning Herald. After working as a secondary teacher for several years in Australia and the UK, Darville returned to the University of Queensland in 2002 to study law. Graduating with a first class honours degree in law in 2005,she commenced work as a judge's associate for Peter Dutney, a justice of the Supreme Court of Queensland. Previously a regular contributor to the libertarian group blog Catallaxy files under the name 'skepticlawyer', Darville now has her own blog in this name. Since gaining her law degree, Darville has also appeared on the SBS program Insight, and as a guest of the University of Melbourne's Publishing and Communications Program. She is associated with the Australian Skeptics, and has written for both their in- house magazine and Quadrant, a conservative journal. In 2007 Darville was reported to be working on a second novel. Dale completed the Bachelor of Civil Law programme at the University of Oxford, where she was a member of Brasenose College. In 2008 she started reading for an MPhil in Law (Jurisprudence). She completed a Graduate LLB degree at the University of Edinburgh School of Law in 2012. During that time she won the Law Society of Scotland's student essay competition. The topic of her prize-winning essay was same-sex marriage. Dale completed a post-graduate qualification before beginning work in 2013 as a trainee solicitor with the law firm MBM Commercial. Darville is reported to have worked variously as a graphic designer, property law lecturer, and physical education teacher. In 2014, Dale returned to Australia, becoming a senior adviser to David Leyonhjelm, a Liberal Democrat member of the Australian Senate. She resigned during the election campaign in 2016. She has recently written a new two-part novel titled Kingdom of the Wicked. The first book, Rules, came out in 2017 and the second, Order, in 2018. It is a reimagining of the trial of Jesus Christ at the hands of Pontius Pilate in a technologically sophisticated Roman Empire. Further reading Meyer-Therese- Marie (2006).

Pictured here is a promotional image from Godzilla Raids Again (1955). In serial fiction, the term \\"reboot\\" signifies a new start to an established fictional universe, work, or series. A reboot discards continuity to re-create its characters, plotlines and backstory from the beginning. It has been described as a way to \\"rebrand\\" or \\"restart an entertainment universe that has already been established\\". Another definition of a reboot is a remake which is part of an established film series or other media franchise. The term has been criticised for being a vague and \\"confusing\\" \\"buzzword\\", and a neologism for remake, a concept which has been losing popularity since the 2010s. William Proctor proposes that there is a distinction between reboots, remakes and retcons. Origin The term is thought to originate from the computing term reboot, meaning to restart a computer system. The first known use of reboot applied to an entertainment franchise was in a 1994 Usenet posting. Types Reboots cut out non-essential elements associated with a pre-established franchise and start it anew, distilling it down to the core elements that made the source material popular. For audiences, reboots allow easier entry for newcomers unfamiliar with earlier titles in a series. =Comic books= In comic books, a long-running title may have its continuity erased to start over from the beginning, enabling writers to redefine characters and open up new story opportunities, allowing the title to bring in new readers. Comic books sometimes use an in-universe explanation for a reboot, such as merging parallel worlds and timelines together, or destroying a fictional universe and recreating it from the beginning.Crisis on Infinite Earths #1-12 (April 1985 ‚Äì March 1986)Flashpoint #1-5 (May ‚Äì September 2011)Zero Hour: Crisis in Time #4-0 (Sept. 1994) =Film= With reboots, filmmakers revamp and reinvigorate a film series to attract new fans and stimulate revenue. A reboot can renew interest in a series that has grown stale. Reboots act as a safe project for a studio, since a reboot with an established fanbase is less risky (in terms of expected profit) than an entirely original work, while at the same time allowing the studio to explore new demographics. Reboots also allow directors and producers to cast a new set of younger actors for the familiar roles of a film series to attract a younger audience. Unlike a remake, however, a reboot often presupposes a working familiarity on the part of the audience with the original work. =Television= In television, a reboot of a TV show can be a return to production after cancellation or a long hiatus, but is also understood to mean a remake of an older series. A related concept is retooling, used to describe a series that substantially changes its premise while keeping some of the core characters while the series is still running, usually in an effort to forestall cancellation. =Video games= Reboots are common in the video game industry. Reboots in video games are used to refresh the storyline and elements of the game and to take advantage of technology and features not available at the time of earlier entries.

Its main instrument is the Large Area Telescope (LAT), with which astronomers mostly intend to perform an all-sky survey studying astrophysical and cosmological phenomena such as active galactic nuclei, pulsars, other high-energy sources and dark matter. Another instrument aboard Fermi, the Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM; formerly GLAST Burst Monitor), is being used to study gamma-ray bursts. Fermi was launched on 11 June 2008 at 16:05 UTC aboard a Delta II 7920-H rocket. The mission is a joint venture of NASA, the United States Department of Energy, and government agencies in France, Germany, Italy, Japan, and Sweden, becoming the most sensitive gamma-ray telescope on orbit, succeeding INTEGRAL. The project is a recognized CERN experiment (RE7).  Overview  Fermi on Earth, solar arrays folded Fermi includes two scientific instruments, the Large Area Telescope (LAT) and the Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM). * The LAT is an imaging gamma-ray detector (a pair-conversion instrument) which detects photons with energy from about 20 million to about 300 billion electronvolts (20 MeV to 300 GeV), with a field of view of about 20% of the sky; it may be thought of as a sequel to the EGRET instrument on the Compton Gamma Ray Observatory. * The GBM consists of 14 scintillation detectors (twelve sodium iodide crystals for the 8 keV to 1 MeV range and two bismuth germanate crystals with sensitivity from 150 keV to 30 MeV), and can detect gamma-ray bursts in that energy range across the whole of the sky not occluded by the Earth. General Dynamics Advanced Information Systems (formerly Spectrum Astro and now Orbital Sciences) in Gilbert, Arizona, designed and built the spacecraft that carries the instruments. It travels in a low, circular orbit with a period of about 95 minutes. Its normal mode of operation maintains its orientation so that the instruments will look away from the Earth, with a \\"rocking\\" motion to equalize the coverage of the sky. The view of the instruments will sweep out across most of the sky about 16 times per day. The spacecraft can also maintain an orientation that points to a chosen target. Both science instruments underwent environmental testing, including vibration, vacuum, and high and low temperatures to ensure that they can withstand the stresses of launch and continue to operate in space. They were integrated with the spacecraft at the General Dynamics ASCENT facility in Gilbert, Arizona. Data from the instruments are available to the public through the Fermi Science Support Center web site. Software for analyzing the data is also available.  GLAST renamed Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope  Fermi gained its new name in 2008: On 26 August 2008, GLAST was renamed the \\"Fermi Gamma- ray Space Telescope\\" in honor of Enrico Fermi, a pioneer in high-energy physics. NASA's Alan Stern, associate administrator for Science at NASA Headquarters, launched a public competition 7 February 2008, closing 31 March 2008, to rename GLAST in a way that would \\"capture the excitement of GLAST's mission and call attention to gamma-ray and high-energy astronomy ... something memorable to commemorate this spectacular new astronomy mission ... a name that is catchy, easy to say and will help make the satellite and its mission a topic of dinner table and classroom discussion\\".  Mission  Video: What is Fermi? Anticipated first year of operations timeline Gamma-ray radiation (greater than 1 Gev) detected over the entire sky; brighter areas are more radiation (five year study by Fermi: 2009‚Äì2013) NASA designed the mission with a five-year lifetime, with a goal of ten years of operations. The key scientific objectives of the Fermi mission have been described as: * To understand the mechanisms of particle acceleration in active galactic nuclei (AGN), pulsars, and supernova remnants (SNR). * Resolve the gamma-ray sky: unidentified sources and diffuse emission. * Determine the high-energy behavior of gamma-ray bursts and transients. * Probe dark matter (e.g. by looking for an excess of gamma rays from the center of the Milky Way) and early Universe. * Search for evaporating primordial micro black holes (MBH) from their presumed gamma burst signatures (Hawking Radiation component). The National Academies of Sciences ranked this mission as a top priority. Many new possibilities and discoveries are anticipated to emerge from this single mission and greatly expand our view of the Universe.See also NASA - Fermi Science and NASA - Scientists Predict Major Discoveries for GLAST. * Blazars and active galaxies :Study energy spectra and variability of wavelengths of light coming from blazars so as to determine the composition of the black hole jets aimed directly at Earth -- whether they are ::(a) a combination of electrons and positrons or ::(b) only protons. * Gamma-ray bursts :Study gamma-ray bursts with an energy range several times more intense than ever before so that scientists may be able to understand them better. * Neutron stars :Study younger, more energetic pulsars in the Milky Way than ever before so as to broaden our understanding of stars. Study the pulsed emissions of magnetospheres so as to possibly solve how they are produced. Study how pulsars generate winds of interstellar particles. * Milky Way galaxy :Provide new data to help improve upon existing theoretical models of our own galaxy. * Gamma-ray background radiation :Study better than ever before whether ordinary galaxies are responsible for gamma-ray background radiation. The potential for a tremendous discovery awaits if ordinary sources are determined to be irresponsible, in which case the cause may be anything from self-annihilating dark matter to entirely new chain reactions among interstellar particles that have yet to be conceived. * The early universe :Study better than ever before how concentrations of visible and ultraviolet light change over time. The mission should easily detect regions of spacetime where gamma-rays interacted with visible or UV light to make matter. This can be seen as an example of E=mc2 working in reverse, where energy is converted into mass, in the early universe. * Sun :Study better than ever before how our own Sun produces gamma rays in solar flares. * Dark matter :Search for evidence that dark matter is made up of weakly interacting massive particles, complementing similar experiments already planned for the Large Hadron Collider as well as other underground detectors. The potential for a tremendous discovery in this area is possible over the next several years. * Fundamental physics :Test better than ever before certain established theories of physics, such as whether the speed of light in vacuum remains constant regardless of wavelength. Einstein's general theory of relativity contends that it does, yet some models in quantum mechanics and quantum gravity predict that it may not. Search for gamma rays emanating from former black holes that once exploded, providing yet another potential step toward the unification of quantum mechanics and general relativity. Determine whether photons naturally split into smaller photons, as predicted by quantum mechanics and already achieved under controlled, man-made experimental conditions. * Unknown discoveries :Scientists estimate a very high possibility for new scientific discoveries, even revolutionary discoveries, emerging from this single mission.  Mission timeline  GLAST launch aboard a Delta II rocket, 11 June 2008 GLAST launch as pictured by a space-based infrared sensor, looking down at the Earth = Prelaunch = On 4 March 2008, the spacecraft arrived at the Astrotech payload processing facility in Titusville, Florida. On 4 June 2008, after several previous delays, launch status was retargeted for 11 June at the earliest, the last delays resulting from the need to replace the Flight Termination System batteries. The launch window extended from 15:45 to 17:40 UTC daily, until 7 August 2008. = Launch = Launch occurred successfully on 11 June 2008 at 16:05 UTC aboard a Delta 7920H-10C rocket from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station Space Launch Complex 17-B. Spacecraft separation took place about 75 minutes after launch. = Orbit = Fermi resides in a low-Earth circular orbit at an altitude of , and at an inclination of 28.5 degrees. = Software modifications = GLAST received some minor modifications to its computer software on 23 June 2008. = LAT/GBM computers operational = Computers operating both the LAT and GBM and most of the LAT's components were turned on 24 June 2008. The LAT high voltage was turned on 25 June, and it began detecting high-energy particles from space, but minor adjustments were still needed to calibrate the instrument. The GBM high voltage was also turned on 25 June, but the GBM still required one more week of testing/calibrations before searching for gamma-ray bursts. = Sky survey mode = After presenting an overview of the Fermi instrumentation and goals, Jennifer Carson of SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory had concluded that the primary goals were \\"all achievable with the all-sky scanning mode of observing\\". Fermi switched to \\"sky survey mode\\" on 26 June 2008 so as to begin sweeping its field of view over the entire sky every three hours (every two orbits). = Collision avoided = On 30 April 2013, NASA revealed that the telescope had narrowly avoided a collision a year earlier with a defunct Cold War-era Soviet spy satellite, Kosmos 1805, in April 2012. Orbital predictions several days earlier indicated that the two satellites were expected to occupy the same point in space within 30 milliseconds of each other. On 3 April, telescope operators decided to stow the satellite's high-gain parabolic antenna, rotate the solar panels out of the way and to fire Fermi's rocket thrusters for one second to move it out of the way. Even though the thrusters had been idle since the telescope had been placed in orbit nearly five years earlier, they worked correctly and potential disaster was thus avoided. = Extended mission 2013-2018 = In August 2013 Fermi started its 5-year mission extension. = Pass 8 software upgrade = Comparison of two Fermi LAT views of the same region in the constellation Carina. The first comes from an older analysis, termed Pass 7, while the second shows the improvements with Pass 8. Both images contain the same number of gamma rays. In the foreground plot, the tall spikes represent greater concentrations of gamma rays and correspond to brightness. Pass 8 provides more accurate directions for incoming gamma rays, so more of them fall closer to their sources, creating taller spikes and a sharper image. In June 2015, the Fermi Collaboration released \\"Pass 8 LAT data\\". Iterations of the analysis framework used by LAT are called \\"passes\\" and at launch Fermi LAT data was analyzed using Pass 6. Significant improvements to Pass 6 were included in Pass 7 which debuted in August 2011. Every detection by the Fermi LAT since its launch, was reexamined with the latest tools to learn how the LAT detector responded to both each event and to the background. This improved understanding led to two major improvements: gamma-rays that had been missed by previous analysis were detected and the direction they arrived from was determined with greater accuracy. The impact of the latter is to sharpen Fermi LAT's vision as illustrated in the figure on the right. Pass 8 also delivers better energy measurements and a significantly increased effective area. The entire mission dataset was reprocessed. These improvements have the greatest impact on both the low and high ends of the range of energy Fermi LAT can detect - in effect expanding the energy range within which LAT can make useful observations. The improvement in the performance of Fermi LAT due to Pass 8 is so dramatic that this software update is sometimes called the cheapest satellite upgrade in history. Among numerous advances, it was allowed for a better search for Galactic spectral lines from dark matter interactions, analysis of extended supernova remnants, and to search for extended sources in the Galactic plane. For almost all event classes, Version P8R2 had a residual background that was not fully isotropic. This anisotropy was traced to cosmic-ray electrons leaking through the ribbons of the Anti-Coincidence Detector and a set of cuts allowed rejection of these events while minimally impacting acceptance. This selection was used to create the P8R3 version of LAT data. = Solar array drive failure = On 16 March 2018 one of Fermi's solar arrays quit rotating, prompting a transition to \\"safe hold\\" mode and instrument power off. This was the first mechanical failure in nearly 10 years. Fermi's solar arrays rotate to maximize the exposure of the arrays to the Sun. The motor that drives that rotation failed to move as instructed in one direction. On 27 March, the satellite was placed at a fixed angle relative to its orbit to maximize solar power. The next day the GBM instrument was turned back on. On 2 April, operators turned LAT on and it resumed operations on 8 April. Alternate observation strategies are being developed due to power and thermal requirements.  Discoveries  Cycle of pulsed gamma rays from the Vela pulsar, constructed from photons detected by LAT = Pulsar discovery = The first major discovery came when the space telescope detected a pulsar in the CTA 1 supernova remnant that appeared to emit radiation in the gamma ray bands only, a first for its kind. This new pulsar sweeps the Earth every 316.86 milliseconds and is about 4,600 light- years away. = Greatest GRB energy release = In September 2008, the gamma- ray burst GRB 080916C in the constellation Carina was recorded by the Fermi telescope. This burst is notable as having \\"the largest apparent energy release yet measured\\". The explosion had the power of about 9,000 ordinary supernovae, and the relativistic jet of material ejected in the blast must have moved at a minimum of 99.9999% the speed of light. Overall, GRB 080916C had \\"the greatest total energy, the fastest motions, and the highest initial- energy emissions\\" ever seen. = Cosmic rays and supernova remnants = In February 2010, it was announced that Fermi-LAT had determined that supernova remnants act as enormous accelerators for cosmic particles. This determination fulfills one of the stated missions for this project. = Background gamma ray sources = In March 2010 it was announced that active galactic nuclei are not responsible for most gamma-ray background radiation. Though active galactic nuclei do produce some of the gamma-ray radiation detected here on Earth, less than 30% originates from these sources. The search now is to locate the sources for the remaining 70% or so of all gamma-rays detected. Possibilities include star forming galaxies, galactic mergers, and yet-to-be explained dark matter interactions. = Milky Way Gamma- and X-ray emitting Fermi bubbles = In November 2010, it was announced that two gamma-ray and X-ray emitting bubbles were detected around Earth's and the Solar System's host galaxy, the Milky Way. The bubbles, named Fermi bubbles, extend about 25 thousand light- years distant above and below the galactic center. The galaxy's diffuse gamma- ray fog hampered prior observations, but the discovery team led by D. Finkbeiner, building on research by G. Dobler, worked around this problem. = Highest energy light ever seen from the Sun = In early 2012, Fermi/GLAST observed the highest energy light ever seen in a solar eruption. = Terrestrial gamma-ray flash observations = Fermi telescope has observed and detected numerous terrestrial gamma-ray flashes and discovered that such flashes can produce 100 trillion positrons, far more than scientists had previously expected. = GRB 130427A = GRB 130427A before and after in more than 100 MeV light On 27 April 2013, Fermi detected GRB 130427A, a gamma-ray burst with one of the highest energy outputs yet recorded. This included detection of a gamma-ray over 94 billion electron volts (GeV). This broke Fermi's previous record detection, by over three times the amount. = GRB coincident with gravitational wave event GW150914 = Fermi reported that its GBM instrument detected a weak gamma-ray burst above 50 keV, starting 0.4 seconds after the LIGO event and with a positional uncertainty region overlapping that of the LIGO observation. The Fermi team calculated the odds of such an event being the result of a coincidence or noise at 0.22%. However, observations from the INTEGRAL telescope's all-sky SPI-ACS instrument indicated that any energy emission in gamma-rays and hard X-rays from the event was less than one millionth of the energy emitted as gravitational waves, concluding that \\"this limit excludes the possibility that the event is associated with substantial gamma-ray radiation, directed towards the observer.\\" If the signal observed by the Fermi GBM was associated with GW150914, SPI-ACS would have detected it with a significance of 15 sigma above the background. The AGILE space telescope also did not detect a gamma-ray counterpart of the event. A follow-up analysis of the Fermi report by an independent group, released in June 2016, purported to identify statistical flaws in the initial analysis, concluding that the observation was consistent with a statistical fluctuation or an Earth albedo transient on a 1-second timescale. A rebuttal of this follow-up analysis, however, pointed out that the independent group misrepresented the analysis of the original Fermi GBM Team paper and therefore misconstrued the results of the original analysis. The rebuttal reaffirmed that the false coincidence probability is calculated empirically and is not refuted by the independent analysis. In October 2018, astronomers reported that GRB 150101B, 1.7 billion light years away from Earth, may be analogous to the historic GW170817. It was detected on 1 January 2015 at 15:23:35 UT by the Gamma-ray Burst Monitor on board the Fermi Gamma- ray Space Telescope, along with detections by the Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) on board the Swift Observatory Satellite. Black hole mergers of the type thought to have produced the gravitational wave event are not expected to produce gamma-ray bursts, as stellar-mass black hole binaries are not expected to have large amounts of orbiting matter. Avi Loeb has theorised that if a massive star is rapidly rotating, the centrifugal force produced during its collapse will lead to the formation of a rotating bar that breaks into two dense clumps of matter with a dumbbell configuration that becomes a black hole binary, and at the end of the star's collapse it triggers a gamma-ray burst. Loeb suggests that the 0.4 second delay is the time it took the gamma-ray burst to cross the star, relative to the gravitational waves. = GRB 170817A signals a multi-messenger transient = On 17 August 2017, Fermi Gamma-Ray Burst Monitor software detected, classified, and localized a gamma-ray burst which was later designated as GRB 170817A. Six minutes later, a single detector at Hanford LIGO registered a gravitational-wave candidate which was consistent with a binary neutron star merger, occurring 2 seconds before the GRB 170817A event. This observation was \\"the first joint detection of gravitational and electromagnetic radiation from a single source\\".  Instruments  Instruments on-board Fermi Fermi is sensitive from , a medium X-ray, to , a very-high-energy gamma ray = Gamma-ray Burst Monitor = The Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) (formerly GLAST Burst Monitor) detects sudden flares of gamma-rays produced by gamma ray bursts and solar flares. Its scintillators are on the sides of the spacecraft to view all of the sky which is not blocked by the Earth. The design is optimized for good resolution in time and photon energy, and is sensitive from (a medium X-ray) to (a medium- energy gamma-ray). \\"Gamma-ray bursts are so bright we can see them from billions of light-years away, which means they occurred billions of years ago, and we see them as they looked then\\", stated Charles Meegan of NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center. The Gamma-ray Burst Monitor has detected gamma rays from positrons generated in powerful thunderstorms. = Large Area Telescope = The Large Area Telescope (LAT) detects individual gamma rays using technology similar to that used in terrestrial particle accelerators. Photons hit thin metal sheets, converting to electron-positron pairs, via a process termed pair production. These charged particles pass through interleaved layers of silicon microstrip detectors, causing ionization which produce detectable tiny pulses of electric charge. Researchers can combine information from several layers of this tracker to determine the path of the particles. After passing through the tracker, the particles enter the calorimeter, which consists of a stack of caesium iodide scintillator crystals to measure the total energy of the particles. The LAT's field of view is large, about 20% of the sky. The resolution of its images is modest by astronomical standards, a few arc minutes for the highest-energy photons and about 3 degrees at 100 MeV. It is sensitive from to (from medium up to some very-high-energy gamma rays). The LAT is a bigger and better successor to the EGRET instrument on NASA's Compton Gamma Ray Observatory satellite in the 1990s. Several countries produced the components of the LAT, who then sent the components for assembly at SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory. SLAC also hosts the LAT Instrument Science Operations Center, which supports the operation of the LAT during the Fermi mission for the LAT scientific collaboration and for NASA.  Education and public outreach  Education and public outreach are important components of the Fermi project. The main Fermi education and public outreach website at http://glast.sonoma.edu offers gateways to resources for students, educators, scientists, and the public. NASA's Education and Public Outreach (E/PO) group operates the Fermi education and outreach resources at Sonoma State University.

Fleer in 1885, was the first company to successfully manufacture bubble gum; it remained a family-owned enterprise until 1989. Fleer originally developed a bubble gum formulation called Blibber-Blubber in 1906. However, while this gum was capable of being blown into bubbles, in other respects it was vastly inferior to regular chewing gum, and Blibber-Blubber was never marketed to the public. In 1928, Fleer employee Walter Diemer improved the Blibber-Blubber formulation to produce the first commercially successful bubble gum, Dubble Bubble. Its pink color set a tradition for nearly all bubble gums to follow. Fleer became known as a maker of sports cards, starting in 1923 with the production of baseball cards. Fleer also released American football (1960) and basketball (1986) card sets through its history. The company also produced some non-sports trading cards. In 1995, Fleer acquired the trading card company SkyBox International and, over Thanksgiving vacation shuttered its Philadelphia plant (where Dubble Bubble had been made for 67 years). In 1998, 70-year-old Dubble Bubble was acquired by Canadian company Concord Confections; Concord, in turn, was acquired by Chicago-based Tootsie Roll Industries in 2004. In late May 2005, news circulated that Fleer was suspending its trading card operations immediately. By early July, in a move similar to declaring bankruptcy, the company began to liquidate its assets to repay creditors. The move included the auction of the Fleer trade name, as well as other holdings. Competitor Upper Deck won the Fleer name, as well as their die cast toy business, at a price of $6.1 million. Just one year earlier, Upper Deck tendered an offer of $25 million, which was rejected by Fleer based on the hope that the sports card market would turn in a direction more favorable to their licenses and target collector demographic. One negative aspect associated with Fleer's Assignment for the Benefit of Creditors is that many sports card collectors now own redemption cards for autographs and memorabilia that may not be able to be redeemed; those fears were somewhat quenched in early 2006 when random memorabilia cards were mailed to the aforementioned collectors. History =Beginning and early attempts at cards= Bill Anderson football card of 1961. Fleer produced football cards from 1960 to 1964 The Fleer company was started by Frank H. Fleer in Philadelphia, 1885, as a confectionery business. Well established as a gum and candy company, Fleer predated many of its competitors into the business of issuing sports cards with its 1923 release of baseball cards in its \\"Bobs and Fruit Hearts\\" candy product. These rare cards are basically the same as the 1923 W515 strip cards but are machine cut and have a printed ad for the candy company on the back. Many years later in 1959 it signed baseball star Ted Williams to a contract and sold an 80-card set oriented around highlights of his career. Fleer was unable to include other players because rival company Topps had signed most active baseball players to exclusive contracts. Williams was nearing the end of his career and retired after the 1960 season. However, Fleer continued to produce baseball cards by featuring Williams with other mostly retired players in a Baseball Greats series. One set was produced in 1960 and a second in 1961. The company did not produce new cards the next year, but continued selling the 1961 set while it focused on signing enough players to produce a set featuring active players in 1963. This 67-card set included a number of stars, including 1962 National League MVP Maury Wills (then holder of the modern record for stolen bases in a season), who had elected to sign with Fleer instead of Topps. Wills and Jimmy Piersall served as player representatives for Fleer, helping to bring others on board. However, Topps still held onto the rights of most players and the set was not particularly successful. Meanwhile, Fleer took advantage of the emergence of the American Football League (AFL) in 1960 to begin producing football cards. Fleer produced a set for the AFL while Topps cards covered the established National Football League. In 1961, each company produced cards featuring players from both leagues. The next year reverted to the status quo ante, with Fleer covering the AFL and Topps the NFL. In 1964, however, Philadelphia Gum secured the rights for NFL cards and Topps took over the AFL.History of football cards on StarrCards.com =Legal battles= non-sports cards such this one depicting singer Dee Clark in 1960 This left Fleer with no product in either baseball or football. The company now turned its efforts to supporting an administrative complaint filed against Topps by the Federal Trade Commission. The complaint focused on the baseball card market, alleging that Topps was engaging in unfair competition through its aggregation of exclusive contracts. A hearing examiner ruled against Topps in 1965, but the Commission reversed this decision on appeal. The Commission concluded that because the contracts only covered the sale of cards with gum, competition was still possible by selling cards with other small, low-cost products. However, Fleer chose not to pursue such options and instead sold its remaining player contracts to Topps for $395,000 in 1966. The decision gave Topps an effective monopoly of the baseball card market. In 1968, Fleer was approached by the Major League Baseball Players Association, a recently organized players' union, about obtaining a group license to produce cards. The MLBPA was in a dispute with Topps over player contracts, and offered Fleer the exclusive rights to market cards of most players starting in 1973, when many of Topps's contracts would expire. Since this was so far in the future, Fleer declined the proposal. Fleer returned to the union in September 1974 with a proposal to sell 5-by-7-inch satin patches of players, somewhat larger than normal baseball cards. By now, the MLBPA had settled its differences with Topps and reached an agreement that gave Topps a right of first refusal on such offers. Topps passed on the opportunity, indicating that it did not think the product would be successful. The union, also fearing that it would cut into existing royalties from Topps sales, then rejected the proposal. In April 1975, Fleer asked for Topps to waive its exclusive rights and allow Fleer to produce stickers, stamps, or other small items featuring active baseball players. Topps refused, and Fleer then sued both Topps and the MLBPA to break the Topps monopoly. After several years of litigation, the Topps monopoly on baseball cards was finally broken by a lawsuit decided by federal judge Clarence Charles Newcomer in 1980, in which the judge ended Topps Chewing Gum's exclusive right to sell baseball cards, allowing the Fleer Corporation to compete in the market.\\"CLARENCE NEWCOMER, 82, LONGTIME FEDERAL JUDGE\\" The court ordered the union to offer group licenses for baseball cards to companies other than Topps. Fleer and another company, Donruss, were thus allowed to begin making cards in 1981. Fleer's legal victory was overturned after one season, but the company continued to manufacture cards, substituting stickers with team logos for gum. =Bill Ripken= In 1989, Bill Ripken's Fleer card showed him holding a bat with the expletive \\"fuck face\\" written in plain view on the knob of the bat. Fleer subsequently rushed to correct the error, and in its haste, released versions in which the text was scrawled over with a marker, whited out with correction fluid, and also airbrushed. On the final, corrected version, Fleer obscured the offensive words with a black box (this was the version included in all factory sets). Both the original card and many of the corrected versions have become collector's items as a result. There are at least ten different variations of this card. As of February 2009 the white out version has a book value of $120, but has been sold in mint condition on eBay for asking prices as high as $1,200.Baseball card variations, from billripken.com Years later, Ripken admitted to having written the expletive on the bat; however, he claimed he did it to distinguish it as a batting practice bat, and did not intend to use it for the card. Some collectors list the card as the \\"Rick Face\\" card. The script on the bat appears to make the word fuck look similar to Rick.Poundstone, William. Biggest Secrets. page 155. =Key trading card sets= Fleer produced two benchmark trading cards in the 1980s. In 1984, Fleer was the only major trading card manufacturer to release a Roger Clemens card; they included the then-Boston Red Sox prospect in their 1984 Fleer Baseball Update Set. The 1984 update set also included the first licensed card of Hall Of Fame outfielder Kirby Puckett. Fleer also released factory sets of their baseball cards from 1986-92. Like the Topps factory sets, they came in colorful boxes for retail and plainer boxes for hobby dealers. The 1986 set was not sealed, but the 1987-89 sets were sealed with a sticker and the 1990-92 sets were shrink- wrapped. In 1986 Fleer helped resurrect the basketball card industry by releasing the 1986-87 Fleer Basketball set which included the rookie cards of Michael Jordan and Charles Barkley. This set is seen by many basketball card collectors as the \\"1952 Topps of basketball.\\" In the late 1990s and early 2000s, the glossy parallel sets Fleer produced for their 1987-89 baseball sets (similar to the Topps Tiffany sets) became very popular in the hobby. However, that popularity wore off, and today, the sets (except for the rare 1989) are not worth much more than the regular sets. 1991 saw the first release of Fleer's Ultra set, which in some years was actually released earlier than its regular Fleer (Tradition) set. The 1991 set had an announced production of 15% of regular Fleer and this set was produced on higher quality card stock and used silver ink, just like Donruss' Leaf set starting the previous year. The 1992 set used UV coating on both sides and gold foil stamping on the front, which was among the most beautiful sets of that year. 1994's Ultra and regular Fleer sets began another tradition of offering an insert card in every pack and the next year started another tradition called \\"hot packs\\" (where about 1:72 packs contained only insert cards. An assortment of the easier to find insert cards and not the rare 1:36 100% foil cards). Still another tradition that continues today is the Ultra Gold Medallion parallel insert set, which started in 1995 and also included all the insert sets for the first two years. These are inserted one per pack. In 1997, Ultra introduced the Platinum Medallion insert set which is traditionally serial numbered to 100. The following year, 1998, saw the introduction of the purple Ultra Masterpieces, which are one of ones. 1998 also started the tradition of including short printed cards in the regular/Gold/Platinum sets. Fleer's super premium flagship set, called Flair, began production in 1993 with an announced production run as 15% of Ultra. Its trademark was that it was printed on very thick card stock (about twice the thickness of regular cards), used a unique glossy finish along with six color printing. The \\"packs\\" are done by shrink wrapping the cards (usually ten in a \\"pack\\") and then placing them in a shrink-wrapped \\"mini-box\\" instead of the usual my-lair foil packs used on virtually all trading card products today. The 1996/1997 Flair Showcase basketball box set included the first one-of-one cards for any major sport called \\"Masterpieces\\"; they paralleled the more common, or \\"base\\", Row 2, Row 1 and Row 0 sets. =Acquisitions= The Fleer family, Frank Fleer descendants, sold Fleer in 1989 for just under US$70,000,000 to John W. Fleer and Charter House Investments. John W. Fleer retained majority ownership in the company. Fleer was pushing into retail-chains like Rite Aid, which brought the ire of the hobby dealers in the early 1990s. Comic-book empire Marvel Entertainment Group, Inc. purchased the company on July 24, 1992 for US$540,000,000. Jeff Kaplan was placed in charge of Fleer by Marvel. Marvel purchased another card company, SkyBox International, on March 8, 1995 for $150,000,000. Fleer/Skybox reduced its push into retail chains to start its Hobby Bullpen program that committed the company to support and provide relief for hobby dealer and collectors. Marvel entered bankruptcy in 1996 along with its subsidiaries. Fleer was directly hurt by the 1994 Major League Baseball strike and prolonged lockouts in the NBA. In June 1997, Marvel formed its Marvel Enterprise division, headed by president and CEO Scott C. Marden, to manage its trading card and sticker businesses, as well as Marvel Interactive, an Internet-entertainment and software-publishing company. Fleer was placed on the market by Marvel at an asking price of $30,000,000. Fleer exited bankruptcy, along with the rest of the Marvel group, on October 1, 1998. In February 1999, Fleer/Skybox was sold to a corporation owned by Alex and Roger Grass, a father and son. In early 2005, Fleer announced that it would cease all productions of trading cards and file an Assignment for the Benefit of Creditors, which is a State Court liquidation, similar to Chapter 7 bankruptcy. In July 2005, Upper Deck acquired the rights to the Fleer name and began producing Fleer-branded basketball, ice hockey and American football cards. The $6.1 million Upper Deck paid for the Fleer name was significantly less than the $25 million UD offered to buy out Fleer a year earlier. In 2006, Upper Deck produced baseball sets under the names Fleer, Fleer Ultra, Fleer Tradition, Flair, Skybox Autographics and Fleer Greats of the Game. The last Fleer-branded baseball cards appeared in 2007.

He was also a cabinet minister from 1964 to 1972, and Speaker of the House of Representatives from 1976 to 1983. Snedden was born in Perth, Western Australia. He served in the Royal Australian Air Force during World War II, and then studied law at the University of Western Australia. From 1951 to 1952, he was the inaugural federal chairman of the Young Liberal Movement. After a period working overseas for the Department of Immigration, Snedden returned to Australia in 1954 and settled in Melbourne. He was elected to the House of Representatives the following year, aged 28. In 1964, Snedden was elevated to cabinet by Robert Menzies. He served as a government minister until the Liberal government's defeat at the 1972 election, under an additional four prime ministers. Snedden spent periods as Attorney-General (1964‚Äì1966), Minister for Immigration (1966‚Äì1969), Minister for Labour and National Service (1969‚Äì1971), and Treasurer (1971‚Äì1972). He was elected deputy leader of the Liberal Party in 1971, and replaced William McMahon as leader after the following year's election loss, thus becoming Leader of the Opposition. Snedden led the Liberal Party to the 1974 federal election, which saw the Labor Party retain government with a narrow majority. Malcolm Fraser mounted two leadership challenges in early 1975, winning on the second attempt; by the end of the year he was prime minister. Snedden was elected to the speakership when the parliament next sat. He held the position for almost seven years, gaining a reputation for impartiality. In retirement, Snedden served as chairman of the Melbourne Football Club and on the board of the Victorian Football League. The unusual circumstances of his death in 1987 attracted much public interest. Early life =Birth and family background= Snedden was born on 31 December 1926 at a private hospital in Newcastle Street, West Perth, Western Australia. He was the youngest of six children born to Catherine (n√©e Mackie) and Alan Snedden. His mother was 43 years old when he was born, and his siblings ‚Äì one sister and four brothers ‚Äì were much older than him. Snedden's parents were born in Alva, Clackmannanshire, Scotland, and spoke \\"broad Scots\\". His grandparents were illiterate, and his parents had only limited schooling; they were both from coal-mining families.Schedvin (1990), p. 3. They immigrated to Australia in 1912 with their three oldest children, initially settling in the remote mining town of Meekatharra.Schedvin (1990), p. 4. The family moved to Perth in about 1921, after their house in Meekatharra burned down. Snedden's father worked mostly as a stonemason, but also spent periods as a miner and general labourer when better work was not available. He reputedly left Scotland to escape a paternity suit, and had earlier been in trouble with the law for poaching. The family name was originally \\"Snaddon\\" (or \\"Snadon\\"), but was changed upon arrival in Australia. =Childhood= Snedden grew up in Perth's inner north near the suburb of Highgate, living initially on Robinson Avenue and later on Bulwer Street. His father left home when he was about three or four years old, and they had only limited contact thereafter.Schedvin (1990), p. 6. His oldest brother Bob became the family's main breadwinner, while his mother worked as a laundress and his other siblings also found jobs.Schedvin (1990), p. 7. He was close to his sister Jean, who often babysat him.Schedvin (1990), p. 9. Snedden worked part-time from about the age of eight, helping his brothers on construction sites and selling and delivering newspapers.Schedvin (1990), p. 11. He began his schooling at Highgate Primary School,Schedvin (1990), p. 12. and later attended the Perth Boys' School through to the ninth grade. Snedden left school in April 1942 and began working as a junior law clerk for Thomas Hughes, who was a solicitor and independent state MP. He would not normally have been considered qualified for the job, but there was a shortage of applicants due to the war. Snedden was eventually able to receive his leaving certificate by attending night school at Perth Technical College.Schedvin (1990), p. 17. He fell out with Hughes late in 1943, and in January 1944 began working as a clerk at the Commonwealth Crown Solicitor's office.Schedvin (1990), p. 18. He was a talented sportsman as a youth, and played a few games for the West Perth Football Club during the 1944 WANFL season, at a time when the competition was age-restricted.Schedvin (1990), p. 19. He later represented Western Australia at the Australian Amateur Football Carnival in Melbourne in 1951. =Military service and university= Snedden and two friends attempted to join the merchant navy at the age of 15, but were unsuccessful. He also attempted to join the Royal Australian Navy when he was 17, but his mother refused her permission; three of his brothers were already on active service. Snedden eventually enlisted in the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) in January 1945, two days after his 18th birthday. He began an air crew training scheme, but as the war came to an end he was taken off the course and given more general duties; this included a period tending bar at an officers' mess. He was discharged in September 1945. As part of his demobilisation, Snedden completed aptitude tests which showed he would be a suitable candidate for a university education. In combination with his earlier clerking experience, this allowed him to secure a place at the University of Western Australia's law school in 1946. Snedden failed two subjects in his first year, and was only able to continue when the law school dean Frank Beasley intervened on his behalf.Schedvin (1990), p. 20. He graduated with a Bachelor of Laws in 1950, and completed his articles of clerkship with Harvey, Slattery, and Gibson. He was called to the bar in December 1951.Schedvin (1990), p. 23. Professional career In 1951, Snedden briefly returned to the Commonwealth Crown Solicitor's office. He resigned from the public service due to a pay cut, and began working for Angus & Coote as a hearing aid salesman.Schedvin (1990), p. 24. In early 1952, he secured a position as a migration officer with the Department of Immigration. He and his family moved to Italy for sixteen months, initially living in Taormina, Sicily, and later in Rome. He learnt to speak Italian, and travelled around the country conducting interviews with prospective migrants.Schedvin (1990), p. 33. In November 1953, Snedden was transferred to England. He stayed there for a year, and was then supposed to be moved on to Germany. However, he decided to return to Australia, and in January 1955 moved to Melbourne to work in a legal advice bureau for ex-servicemen. He and his family settled in Ringwood.Schedvin (1990), p. 34. Political career =Early involvement= Snedden c. 1955 Snedden was state president of the Young Liberals, and from 1951 to 1952 served as the inaugural federal chairman of the organisation. As president of the UWA Liberal Club, he became acquainted with future prime minister Bob Hawke, who was president of the Labor Club.Schedvin (1951), p. 21. As a student, he made three unsuccessful attempts to enter politics, standing for the Liberal Party at the 1948 Boulder state by-election and at the 1949 and 1951 federal elections (in Fremantle and Perth, respectively). =Member of Parliament= In 1954 Snedden moved to Melbourne, where he practised law until 1955, when he was elected to the House of Representatives for the outer suburban seat of Bruce. He defeated Keith Ewert, the former Labor member for nearby Flinders. Snedden defeated Ewert by a similar margin in 1958. In 1961, Snedden faced Ewert again, and this time trailed in initial counting. However, he was elected on Democratic Labor Party preferences.1961 election results in Victoria from Adam Carr's election archive Snedden's narrow win was critical in the outcome of what was the closest election in Australian history up till that time. Had Labor won it, it would have toppled the Coalition after 12 years of rule. However, with Snedden's win, the best Labor could hope for was a hung parliament, though the Coalition was not assured of another term in government until later in the night, with its narrow victory in Moreton. =Cabinet= Snedden in 1961 He served in the ministries of Sir Robert Menzies, Harold Holt, John McEwen, John Gorton and William McMahon. In March 1964 Menzies appointed him Attorney-General. In that capacity he played a significant role in the 1967 constitutional referendum affecting the status of Aboriginals. On 7 April 1965, the Menzies Cabinet decided that it would seek to repeal Section 127 of the Constitution, which excluded indigenous people from the population count, but made no firm plans or timetable for such action. In August 1965, Snedden proposed to Cabinet that abolition of Section 127 was inappropriate unless Section 51(xxvi) was simultaneously amended to remove the words \\"other than the aboriginal race in any state\\". He was rebuffed, but he gained agreement when he made a similar submission to the Holt Cabinet in 1966. The referendum went ahead on 27 May 1967, and was resoundingly approved. Jim Forbes and Doug Anthony in 1963 He was Minister for Immigration 1966‚Äì69, and Minister for Labour and National Service 1969‚Äì71, a difficult job which put him in charge of the government's highly unpopular policy of conscription for the Vietnam War. In 1967, following the death of Harold Holt, he was a candidate for the leadership of the Liberal Party, but his candidacy was not taken very seriously. As Minister for Labour and National Service, Snedden commented on anti-war and anti-conscription activists' demonstrations. On the eve of the first Moratorium, he said in Parliament that the marchers were \\"political bikies pack-raping democracy\\". In 1971, Snedden was appointed Treasurer by William McMahon, and was elected Liberal Deputy Leader, making him the heir apparent to the leadership. =Leader of the Opposition= When McMahon was defeated by the Labor Party under Gough Whitlam in 1972, Snedden was elected as his replacement as Liberal leader, winning by a single vote over Nigel Bowen on the fifth ballot. Snedden promised a new and more \\"liberal\\" Liberal Party, but he suffered from his continuing image as a light-weight, and many Liberals believed he would never defeat Whitlam. Snedden allowed himself to be persuaded to use the conservative majority in the Senate to block the Whitlam government's budget in 1974. Whitlam promptly called a double dissolution election for 18 May, at which he was returned to office, albeit with a reduced majority. Labor campaigned on the slogan \\"Oh no, not Snedden!\\". Snedden exposed himself to ridicule by refusing to concede defeat, insisting at a press conference that \\"while we didn't win, we didn't lose all\\" After the election the conservative wing of the Liberal Party, led by Malcolm Fraser, challenged Snedden's leadership, but he was narrowly re-elected. When he failed to make any headway against Whitlam, Fraser mounted a second challenge, and Snedden was deposed in March 1975, becoming the first leader of the Liberal Party not to gain the prime ministership. He retired to the backbench until February 1976, when Fraser supported his election as Speaker of the House. =Speaker of the House= Snedden was elected Speaker of the House of Representatives on 17 February 1976, defeating the previous Speaker, Gordon Scholes, by a majority of 53 votes.Australia, Parliamentary Debates, House of Representatives, 17 February 1976, p. 7. He was re-elected on 21 February 1978, defeating Labor MP Dr Harry Jenkins by a majority of 44 votes,Australia, Parliamentary Debates, House of Representatives, 21 February 1978, p. 7. and on 25 November 1980, again defeating Dr Jenkins by a majority of 22 votes.Australia, Parliamentary Debates, House of Representatives, 25 November 1980, p. 5. He was the last Speaker of the House of Representatives to wear the formal regalia of full- bottomed wig and gown inherited from the House of Commons of the United Kingdom, believing that it would restore the dignity of the office of Speaker.Philip McCarthy, \\"(Formal) order in the House\\", The Age (Melbourne), 17 February 1976, 3. As Speaker, Snedden sought to enhance the role and assert its independence. He preferred the Speaker to be recognised as an impartial umpire like the Speaker of the House of Commons.Billy Mackie Snedden and M. Bernie Schedvin, Billy Snedden. An Unlikely Liberal, Macmillan, South Melbourne, 1990, p.219. In 1979, he published a paper outlining his proposals for adopting some of the Westminster conventions, namely that the Speaker remain in office for five to seven years then resign and hold no further public office, that the Speaker be unopposed by the major political parties at general elections, and that the Speaker resign from his or her party upon becoming Speaker.Michelle Grattan, \\"Make the Speaker impartial: Snedden\\", The Age (Melbourne), 12 October 1979, 12; Speaker of the House of Representatives, second edition: APH Snedden tried to strengthen the Parliament's ability to withstand pressures from the Executive.Speaker of the House of Representatives, second edition: APH He believed that it was contrary to Parliament's independence for the Executive to control the funds allocated to Parliament, so he authorised parliamentary officers to write a paper in 1976 entitled The Parliamentary Budget. He later wrote, \\"You could not have a situation where the Executive decided the level at which Members could operate efficiently.\\"Snedden and Schevdin, 1990, p. 219. This led to the introduction of the Appropriation (Parliamentary Departments) Bill in 1982.Australia, Parliamentary Debates, House of Representatives, 17 August 1982, p. 75. One of his most memorable actions as Speaker occurred in February 1982 when a Labor frontbencher, Bob Hawke, referred to then Prime Minister Malcolm Fraser as a \\"liar\\" during question time. Fraser was answering a question about two joint royal commissions being conducted in Victoria at the time. Fraser allegedly selectively quoted a statement by the Victorian Leader of the Opposition, John Cain, which provoked Hawke to call Fraser a liar. Snedden followed parliamentary procedure and asked Hawke to withdraw the remark. When Hawke refused, Snedden named him and a motion for his suspension was moved. Snedden later wrote that \\"It was his [Fraser's] instigation which was making the Parliament unworkable, not the Opposition's response, like the classroom situation where the smart little man hits the fellow next to him who retaliates and is seen by the teacher\\".Snedden and Schedvin, 1990, p. 222. Members of the Opposition had by that point taken up \\"liar\\" as a chant, which put Snedden in the position where he would have to name every Member, one by one.Australia, Parliamentary Debates, House of Representatives, 18 February 1982, p. 321; Snedden and Schedvin, 1990, p. 222. After realising that the House would be unworkable for that sitting day, he declined to put the motion for Hawke's suspension. Fraser was furious and attempted to intimidate Snedden to punish Hawke for not withdrawing or take his \\"punishment\\". Snedden refused and was convinced that he would no longer be Speaker, but once Fraser realised that he had no support in the Liberal Party to remove him from office, he sent him a conciliatory message.Snedden and Schedvin, 1990, p. 224. After the defeat of the Fraser Government in 1983 and the election of Dr Harry Jenkins Sr. as Speaker, Sir Billy Snedden resigned from Parliament on 21 April 1983. In doing so, he honoured a feature of his 1979 paper. He believed that if he stayed in Parliament, he might be called for advice on his successor's rulings and that could not happen as it would be undermining the Chair.Australia, Parliamentary Debates, House of Representatives, 21 April 1983, p. 4. He said, \\"I am very conscious that, under the Westminster convention, when the Speaker leaves the chair he leaves the House. I think this is right.\\" He formally resigned from Parliament later that day.Australia, Parliamentary Debates, House of Representatives, 21 April 1983, p. 17. Later life When the Fraser government was defeated by Hawke in 1983, Snedden immediately resigned from Parliament. He separated from his wife, Lady Snedden, and was later to withdraw from public life as his health declined from atherosclerosis and heart disease. Snedden was Chairman of the Melbourne Football Club from 1981 to 1986, later a Director of the Victorian Football League and also Patron of the Professional Boxing Association of Australia. =Death= On 27 June 1987, just hours after attending John Howard's election campaign launch, Snedden suffered a fatal heart attack at the Travelodge motel in Rushcutters Bay, Sydney, while having sex with an ex-girlfriend of his son Drew, identified only as \\"Wendy\\". Melbourne newspaper The Truth headlined its report \\"Snedden died on the job\\", while the Sydney Morning Herald reported that Snedden was wearing a condom and that \\"it was loaded\\". Personal life Snedden married Joy Forsyth, a dental nurse, on 10 March 1950. They had two sons and two daughters together. His daughter Fiona was elected to the Melbourne City Council in 2004 after an unsuccessful candidature for the Liberal Party in the seat of Melbourne Ports in the 1998 federal election. She stood for re- election to council in 2008 but lost her seat. Honours Snedden was appointed a Knight Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George (KCMG) in January 1978.It's an Honour He was appointed a Privy Councillor in 1972.

It stars Parker, Stone, Dian Bachar, Robyn Lynne, and Michael Dean Jacobs. The plot follows Joe Young (Parker), a devout Mormon missionary who, in an effort to pay for his and his fianc√©e's dream wedding and home, hesitantly participates acting in a pornographic film for an abusive porn director. Orgazmo is Parker and Stone's second film, following 1993's Cannibal! The Musical. Plot Everyman Mormon missionary Joseph Young, assigned with his mission partner to Los Angeles, finds the city to be a hostile and unenthusiastic place for their work. The problems worsen when they knock on the door of sleazy porn director Maxxx Orbison and several security guards are sent to dispose of them. Joe defeats all of them singlehandedly with a variety of martial arts skills. Impressed by his performance and bored of his current project's lead actor, Orbison attempts to hire Joe to be the title character and lead of his pornographic superhero film, Orgazmo. Joe is conflicted because of his beliefs, but the salary offered would pay for a wedding in the temple in Utah where his fianc√©e Lisa has expressed a strong desire to wed. Joe reluctantly accepts despite being given a sign from God. Joe finds the crew of the film intimidating but manages to befriend co-star Ben Chapleski, a technical genius and graduate from MIT who works in the pornographic industry to satiate his overactive libido. He plays Orgazmo's sidekick Choda Boy, who assists Orgazmo with specially designed sex toys, including Orgazmo's signature weapon, the Orgazmorator, a ray gun that forces orgasm upon whomever it is fired. Ben invites Joe to his home later on and shows Joe a real, working Orgazmorator Ben has built, and he and Joe spend an evening using it on unsuspecting citizens for amusement. At a sushi bar owned by Ben's Japanese friend G-Fresh, the two witness a group of thugs vandalizing the bar in an attempt to force out G-Fresh so their dance club next door can expand. Later on, when Ben and Joe are not present, G-Fresh is coerced to leave. Upon finding this out, Joe and Ben don costumes and use their film props and the Orgazmorator to sneak into the club and steal back the contract G-Fresh was forced to sign. Joe is agitated after nearly being shot in the head but Ben is excited by finally getting to be a real superhero. Orgazmo becomes an amazing success, both financially and critically, and Orbison withholds Joe's paycheck to keep him in town long enough to announce a sequel, and asks Joe to reprise his role. Tempted with a doubled salary, Joe is confronted by his fianc√©e who has found out what he has been doing and leaves him. Facing production difficulties and harassment from Orbison's unsympathetic nephew A-Cup, Joe tries to back out of the project but Orbison refuses. When Joe stands up to him, Orbison has Lisa kidnapped to force Joe into agreement. When Ben finds out the thugs who assaulted G-Fresh are also working for Orbison, he joins Joe in storming Orbison's mansion before Lisa can be forced to perform in one of Orbison's films. Fighting through Orbison's group of henchmen, Joe and Ben meet their match in A-Cup. Joe encourages Ben to unleash his long-repressed Hamster Style discipline of martial arts, allowing Ben to beat A-Cup. After repairing his damaged Orgazmorator, Joe repeatedly shoots Orbison with it, incapacitating him and capturing all the henchmen. Ben blows up the mansion with another device, the \\"Cock Rocket\\", destroying Orbison's base of operations. Joe and Lisa reconcile and she gives him her blessing to remain in Los Angeles and continue being a hero alongside Ben. As the film ends, Orbison is seen in a doctor's office being told that after so many orgasms in a row, his testicles have swollen to the size of oranges and that surgical removal is the only option. A now insane Orbison declares revenge on Orgazmo as he will now be the personification of A-Cup's character and Orgazmo's nemesis who is immune to the Orgazmorator: Neutered Man.

The Motion Picture Association of America gave the film an NC-17 rating, resulting in a very limited release in the US. There is an 'Unrated' version that was released on the 2-sided DVD set along with the theatrical version; it runs two minutes shorter than the original 94-minute release. The film was released via Blu-ray on May 12, 2015. This includes both versions of the film and all the features from the DVD. Critical reception As of September 2020, the review-aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes gave the film a score of 50%, with an average rating of 5.07/10, based on 34 reviews. The website's critical consensus read: \\"More juvenile than provocative, Orgazmo may have enough good-natured raunch to satisfy writer-director Trey Parker's fans, but its satire is too soft to compete with the South Park co-creator's best work.\\" As of September 2020, the film had a score of 48 out of 100 on Metacritic based on 17 critics, indicating \\"mixed or average reviews\\". Roger Ebert gave the film half a star out of four, arguing that Orgazmo had little of the clever wit Parker and Stone brought to South Park, and furthermore describing the film as \\"callow, gauche, obvious and awkward, and designed to appeal to those with similar qualities\\". Orgazmo has been deemed a cult film, mostly by fans of South Park, which creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone subsequently released to critical acclaim. Its reception and rating by the MPAA is discussed in the 2006 documentary This Film Is Not Yet Rated.

Liberal feminists argue that society holds the false belief that women are, by nature, less intellectually and physically capable than men; thus it tends to discriminate against women in the academy, the forum, and the marketplace. Liberal feminists believe that \\"female subordination is rooted in a set of customary and legal constraints that blocks women's entrance to and success in the so-called public world\\". They strive for sexual equality via political and legal reform. Liberal feminism is often contrasted with radical feminism. Philosophy Liberal feminism does not have a clearly defined set of philosophies. Liberal feminists tend to value individualistic approaches to justice and societal structures instead of broadly blaming inequalities on patriarchal gender relations. According to Susan Wendell, \\"liberal feminism's clearest political commitments, including equality of opportunity, are important to women's liberation and not necessarily incompatible with the goals of socialist and radical feminism.\\" Political liberalism gave feminism a familiar platform for convincing others that their reforms \\"could and should be incorporated into existing law\\". Liberal feminists argued that women, like men, be regarded as autonomous individuals, and likewise be accorded the rights of such. History The goal for liberal feminists beginning in the late 18th century was to gain suffrage for women with the idea that this would allow them to gain individual liberty. They were concerned with gaining freedom through equality, diminishing men's cruelty to women, and gaining opportunities to become full persons. They believed that no government or custom should prohibit the due exercise of personal freedom. Early liberal feminists had to counter the assumption that only white men deserved to be full citizens. Pioneers such as Mary Wollstonecraft, Judith Sargent Murray, and Frances Wright advocated for women's full political inclusion. In 1920, after nearly 50 years of intense activism, women were finally granted the right to vote and the right to hold public office in the United States, and in much of the Western world within a few decades before or a few decades after this time. Liberal feminism was largely quiet in the United States for four decades after winning the vote. In the 1960s during the civil rights movement, liberal feminists drew parallels between systemic race discrimination and sex discrimination. Groups such as the National Organization for Women, the National Women's Political Caucus, and the Women's Equity Action League were all created at that time to further women's rights. In the U.S., these groups have worked, thus far unsuccessfully, for the ratification of the Equal Rights Amendment or \\"Constitutional Equity Amendment\\", in the hopes it will ensure that men and women are treated as equals under the law. Specific issues important to liberal feminists include but are not limited to reproductive rights and abortion access, sexual harassment, voting, education, fair compensation for work, affordable childcare, affordable health care, and bringing to light the frequency of sexual and domestic violence against women.hooks, bell. \\"Feminist Theory: From Margin to Center\\" Cambridge, MA: South End Press 1984 Writers Feminist writers associated with this theory include Mary Wollstonecraft, John Stuart Mill, Helen Taylor, and Elizabeth Cady Stanton; Second Wave feminists Betty Friedan, Gloria Steinem, Simone de Beauvoir; and Third Wave feminist Rebecca Walker. Mary Wollstonecraft ;Mary Wollstonecraft Mary Wollstonecraft (1759‚Äì1797) has been very influential in her writings as A Vindication of the Rights of Woman commented on society's view of women and encouraged women to use their voices in making decisions separate from decisions previously made for them. Wollstonecraft \\"denied that women are, by nature, more pleasure seeking and pleasure giving than men. She reasoned that if they were confined to the same cages that trap women, men would develop the same flawed characters. What Wollstonecraft most wanted for women was personhood.\\" She argued that patriarchal oppression is a form of slavery that could no longer be ignored . Wollstonecraft argued that the inequality between men and women existed due to the disparity between their educations. Along with Judith Sargent Murray and Frances Wright, Wollstonecraft was one of the first major advocates for women's full inclusion in politics. ;Elizabeth Cady Stanton Elizabeth Cady Stanton Elizabeth Cady Stanton (November 12, 1815 ‚Äì October 26, 1902) was one of the most influential women in first wave feminism. An American social activist, she was instrumental in orchestrating the Seneca Falls Convention, the first women's rights convention, which was held in Seneca Falls, New York. Not only was the suffragist movement important to Stanton, she also was involved in women's parental and custody rights, divorce laws, birth control, employment and financial rights, among other issues. Her partner in this movement was the equally influential Susan B. Anthony. Together, they fought for a linguistic shift in the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments to include \\"female\\". Additionally, in 1890 she founded the National American Woman Suffrage Association and presided as president until 1892. She produced many speeches, resolutions, letters, calls, and petitions that fed the first wave and kept the spirit alive. Furthermore, by gathering a large number of signatures, she aided the passage of the Married Women's Property Act of 1848 which considered women legally independent of their husbands and granted them property of their own. Together these women formed what was known as the NWSA (National Women Suffrage Association), which focused on working legislatures and the courts to gain suffrage. ;John Stuart Mill John Stuart Mill John Stuart Mill (May 20, 1806 ‚Äì May 8, 1873) believed that both sexes should have equal rights under the law and that \\"until conditions of equality exist, no one can possibly assess the natural differences between women and men, distorted as they have been. What is natural to the two sexes can only be found out by allowing both to develop and use their faculties freely.\\" Mill frequently spoke of this imbalance and wondered if women were able to feel the same \\"genuine unselfishness\\" that men did in providing for their families. This unselfishness Mill advocated is the one \\"that motivates people to take into account the good of society as well as the good of the individual person or small family unit\\". Similar to Mary Wollstonecraft, Mill compared sexual inequality to slavery, arguing that their husbands are often just as abusive as masters, and that a human being controls nearly every aspect of life for another human being. In his book The Subjection of Women, Mill argues that three major parts of women's lives are hindering them: society and gender construction, education, and marriage. He also argues that sex inequality is greatly inhibiting the progress of humanity.

It supports the Equal Rights Amendment, reproductive rights including freer access to abortion, as well as lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender rights (LGBT rights), and economic justice. It opposes violence against women and racism. Various other issues the National Organization for Women also deals with are: *Affirmative action *Disability rights *EcoFeminism *Family *Opposing right-wing causes contrary to NOW's interests *Global feminism *Women's health *Immigration *Promotion of nominating judges with feminist viewpoints *Legislation *Legal recognition of same-sex marriages *Media activism *Mothers' economic Rights *Working for peace; opposition to conflicts such as the Iraq War *Social Security *Supreme Court *Title IX/Education *Welfare *Workplace discrimination *Women in the Military *Young feminist programs =The National Women's Political Caucus= The National Women's Political Caucus (NWPC), founded in 1971, is the only national organization dedicated exclusively to increasing women's participation in all areas of political and public life as elected and appointed officials, as delegates to national party conventions, as judges in the state and federal courts, and as lobbyists, voters and campaign organizers. Founders of NWPC include such prominent women as Gloria Steinem, author, lecturer and founding editor of Ms. Magazine; former Congresswoman Shirley Chisholm; former Congresswoman Bella Abzug; Dorothy Height, former president of the National Council of Negro Women; Jill Ruckelshaus, former U.S. Civil Rights Commissioner; Ann Lewis, former Political Director of the Democratic National Committee; Elly Peterson, former vice-chair of the Republican National Committee; LaDonna Harris, Indian rights leader; Liz Carpenter, author, lecturer and former press secretary to Lady Bird Johnson; and Eleanor Holmes Norton, Delegate to the U.S. House of Representatives and former chair of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. These women were spurred by Congress' failure to pass the Equal Rights Amendment in 1970. They believed legal, economic and social equity would come about only when women were equally represented among the nation's political decision-makers. Their faith that women's interests would best be served by women lawmakers has been confirmed time and time again, as women in Congress, state legislatures and city halls across the country have introduced, fought for and won legislation to eliminate sex discrimination and meet women's changing needs. =The Women's Equity Action League= The Women's Equity Action League (WEAL) was a national membership organization, with state chapters and divisions, founded in 1968 and dedicated to improving the status and lives of women primarily through education, litigation, and legislation. It was a more conservative organization than NOW and was formed largely by former members of that organization who did not share NOW's assertive stance on socio-sexual issues, particularly on abortion rights. WEAL spawned a sister organization, the Women's Equity Action League Fund, which was incorporated in 1972 \\"to help secure legal rights for women and to carry on educational and research projects on sex discrimination\\". The two organizations merged in 1981 following changes in the tax code. WEAL dissolved in 1989{{cite web ref=harv last1=Kraft first1=Katherine Gray last2=Stickney first2=Zephorene L. title=Women's Equity Action League.

Three years after women won the right to vote, the Equal Right Amendment (ERA) was introduced in Congress by Senator Charles Curtis Curtis and Representative Daniel Read Anthony Jr., both Republicans. This amendment stated that civil rights cannot be denied on the basis of one's sex. It was authored by Alice Paul, head of the National Women's Party, who led the suffrage campaign. Through the efforts of Alice Paul, the Amendment was introduced into each session of the United States Congress. But it was buried in committee in both Houses of Congress. In 1946, it was narrowly defeated by the full Senate, 38‚Äì35. In February 1970 twenty NOW leaders disrupted the hearings of the U.S. Senate Subcommittee on Constitutional Amendments, demanding the ERA be heard by the full Congress. In May of that year, the Senate Subcommittee began hearings on the ERA under Senator Birch Bayh. In June, the ERA finally left the House Judiciary Committee due to a discharge petition filed by Representative Martha Griffiths. In March 1972, the ERA was approved by the full Senate without changes, 84‚Äì8. Senator Sam Ervin and Representative Emanuel Celler succeeded in setting a time limit of seven years for ratification. The ERA then went to the individual states for approval but failed to win in enough of them (38) to become law. In 1978 Congress passed a disputed (less than supermajority) three year extension on the original seven year ratification limit but the ERA could not gain approval by the needed number of states. The state legislatures that were most hostile to the ERA were Utah, Florida, Illinois, North Carolina and Oklahoma. The NOW holds that the single most obvious problem in passing the ERA was the gender and racial imbalance in the legislatures. More than 2/3 of the women and all of the African Americans in state legislatures voted for the ERA, but less than 50% of the white men in the targeted legislatures cast pro-ERA votes in 1982.  Equity feminism  Equity feminism is a form of liberal feminism discussed since the 1980s, * Citing: :* specifically a kind of classically liberal or libertarian feminism, emphasizing equality under law, equal freedoms and rights, rather than profound social transformations. (Revised 30 September 2013.) The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy refers to Wendy McElroy, Joan Kennedy Taylor, Cathy Young, Rita Simon, Katie Roiphe, Diana Furchtgott-Roth, Christine Stolba, and Christina Hoff Sommers as equity feminists. Steven Pinker, an evolutionary psychologist, identifies himself as an equity feminist, which he defines as \\"a moral doctrine about equal treatment that makes no commitments regarding open empirical issues in psychology or biology\\". Barry Kuhle asserts that equity feminism is compatible with evolutionary psychology, in contrast to gender feminism. * See also: :*  Critics  = Main Critiques = Critics of liberal feminism argue that its individualist assumptions make it difficult to see the ways in which underlying social structures and values disadvantage women. They argue that even if women are not dependent upon individual men, they are still dependent upon a patriarchal state. These critics believe that institutional changes like the introduction of women's suffrage are insufficient to emancipate women. One of the more prevalent critiques of liberal feminism is that it, as a study, allows too much of its focus to fall on a \\"metamorphosis\\" of women into men, and in doing so, disregards the significance of the traditional role of women. One of the leading scholars who have critiqued liberal feminism is radical feminist Catherine A. MacKinnon, an American lawyer, writer and social activist. Specializing in issues regarding sex equality, she has been intimately involved in the cases regarding the definition of sexual harassment and sex discrimination. She, among other radical feminist scholars, views liberalism and feminism as incompatible because liberalism offers women a \\"piece of the pie as currently and poisonously baked\\". bell hooks' main criticism of the philosophies of liberal feminism is that they focus too much on equality with men in their own class. She maintains that the \\"cultural basis of group oppression\\" is the biggest challenge, in that liberal feminists tend to ignore it. = White woman's burden = Another important critique of liberal feminism posits the existence of a \\"white woman's burden\\" or White savior complex. The phrase \\"white woman's burden\\" derives from The White Man's Burden. Critics such as black feminists and postcolonial feminists assert that mainstream liberal feminism reflects only the values of middle-class, heterosexual, white women and fails to appreciate the position of women of different races, cultures or classes. With this, white liberal feminists reflect the issues that underlie the White savior complex. They do not understand women that are outside the dominant society but try to \\"save\\" or \\"help\\" them by pushing them to assimilate to their ideals of feminism. According to such critics liberal feminism fails to recognize the power dynamics that are in play with women of color and transnational women which involve multiple sources of oppression.

This thrush- like Old World flycatcher was formerly placed in the family Turdidae. It breeds in southern Europe, northwest Africa, and from Central Asia to northern China and Malaysia. The blue rock thrush is the official national bird of Malta and was shown on the Lm 1 coins that were part of the country's former currency. Taxonomy The blue rock thrush was described by Carl Linnaeus in 1758 in the 10th edition of his Systema Naturae under the binomial name Turdus solitarius. The scientific name is from Latin. Monticola is from mons, montis \\"mountain\\", and colere, \\"to dwell\\", and the specific epithet solitarius means \\"solitary\\".. The rock thrush genus Monticola was formerly placed in the family Turdidae but molecular phylogenetic studies have shown that the species in the genus are more closely related to members of the Old World flycatcher family Muscicapidae. There are five recognised subspecies: * M. s. solitarius (Linnaeus, 1758) ‚Äì northwest Africa, south Europe, north Turkey to Georgia and Azerbaijan. * M. s. longirostris (Blyth, 1847) ‚Äì Greece and west and south Turkey through the Middle East to the northwest Himalayas to northeast Africa and India * M. s. pandoo (Sykes, 1832) ‚Äì central Himalayas to east China and north Vietnam to Greater Sunda Islands * M. s. philippensis (Statius M√ºller, 1776) ‚Äì east Mongolia to Sakhalin south to Japan, extreme north Philippines and northeast China to Indonesia * M. s. madoci Chasen, 1940 ‚Äì Malay Peninsula and north Sumatra There is a proposal to split Monticola solitarius into two species: a western taxon comprising M. s. solitarius and M. s. longirostris and an eastern taxon with M. s. philippensis, M. s. pandoo and M. s. madoci. Description The blue rock thrush is a starling-sized bird, in length with a long slim bill. The breeding male of the nominate subspecies is unmistakable, with all blue-grey plumage apart from its darker wings. Females and immatures are much less striking, with dark brown upperparts, and paler brown scaly underparts. The male of the subspecies M. s. philippensis has rufous-chestnut plumage from the mid-breast down to the undertail. Both sexes lack the reddish outer tail feathers of rock thrush. The male blue rock thrush sings a clear, melodious call that is similar to, but louder than the call of the rock thrush. Distribution and habitat female at Kutch The European, north African and southeast Asian birds are mainly resident, apart from altitudinal movements. Other Asian populations are more migratory, wintering in sub-Saharan Africa, India and southeast Asia. This bird is a very uncommon visitor to northern and western Europe. Behaviour Blue rock thrush breeds in open mountainous areas. It nests in rock cavities and walls, and usually lays 3-5 eggs. An omnivore, the blue rock thrush eats a wide variety of insects and small reptiles in addition to berries and seeds.

In his realistic genre paintings he used mythological themes, making modern interpretations of classical subjects, with an emphasis on the female human body. During his life he enjoyed significant popularity in France and the United States, was given numerous official honors, and received top prices for his work. As the quintessential salon painter of his generation, he was reviled by the Impressionist avant-garde. By the early twentieth century, Bouguereau and his art fell out of favor with the public, due in part to changing tastes. In the 1980s, a revival of interest in figure painting led to a rediscovery of Bouguereau and his work. Throughout the course of his life, Bouguereau executed 822 known finished paintings, although the whereabouts of many are still unknown. Life and career =Formative years= William-Adolphe Bouguereau was born in La Rochelle, France, on 30 November 1825, into a family of wine and olive oil merchants.Wissman 1996, p. 11. The son of Th√©odore Bouguereau (born 1800) and Marie Bonnin (1804), known as Adeline, William was brought up a Catholic. He had an elder brother, Alfred, and a younger sister, Marie (known as Hanna), who died when she was seven. The family moved to Saint-Martin-de-R√© in 1832. Another sibling was born in 1834, Kitty. At the age of 12, Bouguereau went to Mortagne to stay with his uncle Eug√®ne, a priest and developed a love of nature, religion and literature. In 1839, he was sent to study for the priesthood at a Catholic college in Pons. Here he was taught to draw and paint by Louis Sage, who had studied under Ingres. Bouguereau reluctantly left his studies to return to his family, now residing in Bordeaux. There he met a local artist, Charles Marionneau, and commenced at the Municipal School of Drawing and Painting in November 1841. Bouguereau also worked as a shop assistant, hand-colouring lithographs and making small paintings that were reproduced using chromolithography. He was soon the best pupil in his class, and decided to become an artist in Paris. To fund the move, he sold portraits ‚Äì 33 oils in three months. All were unsigned and only one has been traced. He arrived in Paris aged 20 in March 1846.Bartoli, Damien and Ross, Frederick C. William Bouguereau: His Life and Works, 2010 √âgalit√© devant la mort (Equality Before Death), 1848, oil on canvas, 141 √ó 269 cm (55.5 √ó 105.9 in), Mus√©e d'Orsay, Paris. Equality is Bouguereau's first major painting, produced after two years at the √âcole des Beaux-Arts de Paris at the age of 23. Bouguereau became a student at the √âcole des Beaux-Arts. To supplement his formal training in drawing, he attended anatomical dissections and studied historical costumes and archeology. He was admitted to the studio of Fran√ßois-√âdouard Picot, where he studied painting in the academic style. Dante and Virgil in Hell (1850) was an early example of his neo-classical works. Academic painting placed the highest status on historical and mythological subjects, and Bouguereau determined to win the Prix de Rome, which would gain him a three-year residence at the Villa Medici in Rome, Italy, where in addition to formal lessons he could study first-hand the Renaissance artists and their masterpieces, as well as Greek, Etruscan, and Roman antiquities. =Villa Medici, Rome 1851‚Äì1854= The young artist entered the Prix de Rome contest in April 1848. Soon after work began there were riots in Paris, and Bouguereau enrolled in the National Guard. After an unsuccessful attempt to win the prize, he entered again in 1849. Following 106 days of competition, he again failed to win. His third attempt commenced unsuccessfully in April 1850 with Dante and Vigil in Hell but five months later, he heard he had won a joint first prize for Zenobia Found by Shepherds on the Banks of the Araxes. Along with other category winners, he set off for Rome in December and finally arrived at the Villa Medici in January 1851. Bouguereau explored the city, making sketches and watercolours as he went. He also studied classical literature, which influenced his subject choice for the rest of his career. He walked to Naples and on to Capri, Amalfi and Pompeii. Still based in Rome and working hard on course work, there were more explorations of Italy in 1852. Although he had a strong admiration for all traditional art, he particularly revered Greek sculpture, Leonardo da Vinci, Raphael, Michelangelo, Titian, Rubens and Delacroix. In April 1854, he left Rome and returned to La Rochelle. =Height of career= Nymphs and Satyr, 1873, oil on canvas, 260 √ó 180 cm (102.4 √ó 70.9 in), Clark Art Institute Bouguereau, painting within the traditional academic style, exhibited at the annual exhibitions of the Paris Salon for his entire working life. An early reviewer stated, \\"M. Bouguereau has a natural instinct and knowledge of contour. The eurythmie of the human body preoccupies him, and in recalling the happy results which, in this genre, the ancients and the artists of the sixteenth century arrived at, one can only congratulate M. Bouguereau in attempting to follow in their footsteps ... Raphael was inspired by the ancients ... and no one accused him of not being original.\\"Wissman 1996, p. 24. Raphael was a favourite of Bouguereau and he took this review as a high compliment. He had fulfilled one of the requirements of the Prix de Rome by completing an old-master copy of Raphael's The Triumph of Galatea. In many of his works, he followed the same classical approach to composition, form, and subject matter.Wissman 1996, p. 25. Bouguereau's graceful portraits of women were considered very charming, partly because he could beautify a sitter while also retaining her likeness. Although Bouguereau spent most of his life in Paris, he returned to La Rochelle again and again throughout his professional life. He was revered in the town of his birth and undertook decorating commissions from local citizens. From the early 1870s, he and his family spent every summer in La Rochelle. In 1882, he decided that rather than rent he would purchase a house, as well as local farm buildings. By August of that year, the family's permanent summer base was on the rue Verdi√®re. The artist commenced several paintings here and completed them in his Paris studio. The Holy Family (1863) Bouguereau flourished after his Villa Medici residence. In 1854‚Äì55 he decorated a pavilion at the grand house of a cousin in Angoulins, including four large paintings of figures depicting the seasons. He was happy to undertake other commissions to pay off the debts accrued in Italy and to help his penniless mother. He decorated a mansion with nine large paintings of allegorical figures. In 1856, the Ministry of State for Fine Arts commissioned him to paint Emperor Napoleon III Visiting the Victims of the Tarascon Flood. There were decorations for the chapel at Saint-Clotilde. He received the Legion of Honour on 12 July 1859. By this time, Bouguereau was turning away from history painting and lengthy commissions to work on more personal paintings, with realistic and rustic themes. By the late 1850s, he had made strong connections with art dealers, particularly Paul Durand-Ruel (later the champion of the Impressionists), who helped clients buy paintings from artists who exhibited at the Salons.Wissman 1996, p. 13. Thanks to Durand-Ruel, Bouguereau met Hugues Merle, who later often was compared to Bouguereau. The Salons annually drew over 300,000 people, providing valuable exposure to exhibited artists.Wissman 1996, p. 70. Bouguereau's fame extended to England by the 1860s.Wissman 1996, p. 14. Three paintings were shown at the 1863 Salon and Holy Family (Now at Chimei Museum) was sold to Napoleon III, who presented it to his wife the Empress Eug√©nie, who hung it in her Tuileries apartment. The Bather, (1864) Bather (1864), a shocking nude, was submitted to an exhibition in Ghent, Belgium. It was a spectacular success and purchased by the museum at great expense. At this time, William took on decorative work at the Grand Th√©√¢tre, Bordeaux, which lasted four years. In 1875, with assistants, he began work on a La Rochelle chapel ceiling, producing six paintings on copper over the next six years. Once installed in the city in summer 1875 he began Piet√†, one of his greatest religious paintings and shown at the 1876 Salon, in tribute to his son Georges. At the behest of King William III of the Netherlands, Bouguereau went to Het Loo Palace in May 1876. The king admired the artist and they spent intimate times together. In May 1878 the Paris Universal Exhibition opened to showcase French work. Bouguereau found and borrowed twelve of his paintings from their owners, including his new work Nymphaeum. Bouguereau was a staunch traditionalist whose genre paintings and mythological themes were modern interpretations of Classical subjects, both pagan and Christian, with a concentration on the naked female form. The idealized world of his paintings brought to life goddesses, nymphs, bathers, shepherdesses, and madonnas in a way that appealed to wealthy art patrons of the era. Bouguereau employed traditional methods of working up a painting, including detailed pencil studies and oil sketches, and his careful method resulted in a pleasing and accurate rendering of the human form. His painting of skin, hands, and feet was particularly admired.Wissman 1996, p. 112. He also used some of the religious and erotic symbolism of the Old Masters, such as the \\"broken pitcher\\" which connoted lost innocence.Wissman 1996, p. 60. Bouguereau received many commissions to decorate private houses and public buildings, and, early on, this added to his prestige and fame. As was typical of such commissions, he would sometimes paint in his own style, and at other times conform to an existing group style. He also made reductions of his public paintings for sale to patrons, of which The Annunciation (1888) is an example.Wissman 1996, p. 31. He was also a successful portrait painter and many of his paintings of wealthy patrons remain in private hands.Wissman 1996, p. 103. =Acad√©mie Julian= From the 1860s, Bouguereau was closely associated with the Acad√©mie Julian where he gave lessons and advice to art students, male and female, from around the world. During several decades he taught drawing and painting to hundreds, if not thousands, of students. Many of them managed to establish artistic careers in their own countries, sometimes following his academic style, and in other cases, rebelling against it, like Henri Matisse. He married his most famous pupil, Elizabeth Jane Gardner, after the death of his first wife. Bouguereau received many honors from the Academy: he became a Life Member in 1876; received the Grand Medal of Honour in 1885;Wissman 1996, p. 16. was appointed Commander of the Legion of Honor in 1885; and was made Grand Officier of the Legion of Honour in 1905.Minist√®re de la Culture et de la Communication, Base L√©onore, Archives Nationales He began to teach drawing at the Acad√©mie Julian in 1875, a co-ed art institution independent of the √âcole des Beaux-Arts, with no entrance exams and nominal fees.Wissman 1996, p. 110. =Wives and children= Portrait by Bouguereau of his wife Elizabeth Jane Gardner, Chimei Museum, Tainan, Taiwan In 1856, William began living with one of his models, Nelly Monchablon, a 19-year-old from Lisle-en-Rigault. Living together out of wedlock, the pair kept their liaison a secret. Their first child, Henriette, was born in April 1857; Georges was born in January 1859. A third child, Jeanne, was born 25 December 1861. The couple married quietly (for many assumed they were already wed) on 24 May 1866. Eight days later, Jeanne died from tuberculosis. In mourning, the couple went to La Rochelle, and Bouguereau made a painting of her in 1868. A fourth child, Adolphe (known as Paul), was born in October 1868. Aged 15, Georges' health suffered, and his mother took him away from the bad air of Paris. However, he died on 19 June 1875. Nelly had a fifth child in 1876, Maurice, but her health was declining and the doctors suspected that she had contracted tuberculosis. She died on 3 April 1877, and baby Maurice died two months later.Wissman 1996, p. 15. The artist planned to marry Elizabeth Jane Gardner, a pupil whom he had known for ten years, but his mother was opposed to the idea. Soon after Nelly's death, she made Bouguereau swear he would not remarry within her lifetime. After his mother's death, and after a nineteen-year engagement, he and Gardner married in Paris in June 1896. His wife continued to work as his private secretary, and helped to organize the household staff. His son Paul contracted tuberculosis in early 1899; Paul, his stepmother, and Bouguereau went to Menton in the south. When the stay was prolonged, the artist found a room in which to paint. Paul died at his father's house in April 1900, aged 32; Bouguereau had outlived four of his five children, only Henriette outlived him. Elizabeth, who was with her husband to the end, died in Paris in January 1922. =Homes= When Bouguereau arrived in Paris in March 1846, he resided at the Hotel Corneille at 5 rue Corneille. In 1855, after his stay in Rome, he lived at 27 rue de Fleurus, and the following year rented a fourth-floor studio at 3 rue Carnot, near his apartment. In 1866, the year of his marriage to Nelly, he bought a vast plot of land on the rue Notre-Dame-des-Champs, and an architect was commissioned to design a grand house with a top-floor studio. The family was installed in 1868, together with five servants and with his mother, Adeline, visiting daily. Bouguereau spent the rest of his life here and at La Rochelle. =Later years and death= Bouguereau was an assiduous painter, often completing twenty or more easel paintings in a single year. Even during the twilight years of his life, he would rise at dawn to work on his paintings six days a week and would continue painting until nightfall. Throughout the course of his lifetime, he is known to have painted at least 822 paintings. Many of these paintings have been lost. Near the end of his life he described his love of his art: \\"Each day I go to my studio full of joy; in the evening when obliged to stop because of darkness I can scarcely wait for the next morning to come ... if I cannot give myself to my dear painting I am miserable.\\"Wissman 1996, p. 114. In the spring of 1905, Bouguereau's house and studio in Paris were burgled. On 19 August 1905, aged 79, Bouguereau died in La Rochelle from heart disease. There was an outpouring of grief in the town of his birth. After a Mass at the cathedral, his body was placed on a train to Paris for a second ceremony. Bouguereau was laid to rest with Nelly and his children at the family vault at Montparnasse Cemetery.

He also gained wide fame in Belgium, the Netherlands, Portugal, Spain, Italy, Romania and in the United States, and commanded high prices. His works often sold within days of completion. Some were viewed by international collectors and bought before work had even finished. Bouguereau‚Äôs career was nearly a direct ascent with hardly a setback.Wissman 1996, p. 9. To many, he epitomized taste and refinement, and a respect for tradition. To others, he was a competent technician stuck in the past. Degas and his associates used the term \\"Bouguereaut√©\\" in a derogatory manner to describe any artistic style reliant on \\"slick and artificial surfaces\\", also known as a licked finish. In an 1872 letter, Degas wrote that he strove to emulate Bouguereau's ordered and productive working style, although with Degas' famous trenchant wit, and the aesthetic tendencies of the Impressionists, it is possible the statement was meant to be ironic. Paul Gauguin loathed him, rating him a round zero in Racontars de Rapin and later describing in Avant et apr√®s (Intimate Journals) the single occasion when Bouguereau made him smile on coming across a couple of his paintings in an Arles' brothel, \\"where they belonged\\". Bouguereau's works were eagerly bought by American millionaires who considered him the most important French artist of that time. For example, Nymphs and Satyr was purchased first by John Wolfe, then sold by his heiress Catharine Lorillard Wolfe to hotelier Edward Stokes, who displayed it in New York City's Hoffman House Hotel. Two paintings by Bouguereau in the Nob Hill mansion of Leland Stanford were destroyed in the San Francisco earthquake and fire of 1906.Osborne, Carol M. Museum Builders in the West: The Stanfords as Collectors and Patrons of Art, 1870-1906. Stanford University Museum of Art, 1986, p. 18. Gold Rush tycoon Ben Ali Haggin and his family, who normally eschewed the nude, made an exception for Bouguereau's Nymphaeum. However, even during his lifetime, there was critical dissent in assessing his work; the art historian Richard Muther wrote in 1894 that Bouguereau was a man \\"destitute of artistic feeling but possessing a cultured taste [who] reveals... in his feeble mawkishness, the fatal decline of the old schools of convention.\\" In 1926, American art historian Frank Jewett Mather criticized the commercial intent of Bouguereau's work, writing that the artist \\"multiplied vague, pink effigies of nymphs, occasionally draped them, when they became saints and madonnas, painted on the great scale that dominates an exhibition, and has had his reward. I am convinced that the nude of Bouguereau was prearranged to meet the ideals of a New York stockbroker of the black walnut generation.\\" Bouguereau confessed in 1891 that the direction of his mature work was largely a response to the marketplace: \\"What do you expect, you have to follow public taste, and the public only buys what it likes. That's why, with time, I changed my way of painting.\\" Nymphaeum, 1878, Haggin Museum Bouguereau fell into disrepute after 1920, due in part to changing tastes. Comparing his work to that of his Realist and Impressionist contemporaries, Kenneth Clark faulted Bouguereau's painting for \\"lubricity\\", and characterized such Salon art as superficial, employing the \\"convention of smoothed-out form and waxen surface.\\"Clark, Kenneth. The Nude; A Study in Ideal Form, 163‚Äì164. Princeton University Press, 1956. The New York Cultural Center staged a show of Bouguereau's work in 1974‚Äîpartly as a curiosity, although curator Robert Isaacson had his eye on the long-term rehabilitation of Bouguereau's legacy and reputation.IIsaacson, Robert. William-Adolphe Bouguereau (catalogue). New York Cultural Center and Farleigh Dickinson, 1974. In 1984, the Borghi Gallery hosted a commercial show of 23 oil paintings and one drawing. In the same year a major exhibition was organized by the Montreal Museum of Fine Arts in Canada. The exhibition opened at the Mus√©e du Petit- Palais, in Paris, traveled to The Wadsworth Atheneum in Hartford, and concluded in Montr√©al. More recently, resurgence in the artist's popularity has been promoted by American collector Fred Ross, who owns a number of paintings by Bouguereau and features him on his website at Art Renewal Center. In 2019, the Milwaukee Art Museum assembled more than 40 of Bouguereau's paintings for a major retrospective of his work, which according to the Wall Street Journal, asked the readers to \\"see Bouguereau through the eyes of an age when he was lionized, and Impressionism was dismissed as 'French freedom.' \\" The exhibition later was scheduled to travel to the Memphis Brooks Museum of Art in Memphis, Tenn., and then to the San Diego Museum of Art. Prices for Bouguereau's works have climbed steadily since 1975, with major paintings selling at high prices: $1,500,000 in 1998 for The Heart's Awakening, $2,600,000 in 1999 for The Motherland and Charity at auction in May 2000 for $3,500,000. Bouguereau's works are in many public collections. Notre Dame des Anges (\\"Our Lady of the Angels\\") was last shown publicly in the United States at the World's Columbian Exhibition in Chicago in 1893. It was donated in 2002 to the Daughters of Mary Mother of Our Savior, an order of nuns affiliated with Clarence Kelly's Traditionalist Catholic Society of St. Pius V. In 2009, the nuns sold it for $450,000 to an art dealer, who was able to sell it for more than $2 million. Kelly was subsequently found guilty by a jury in Albany, New York, of defaming the dealer in remarks made in a television interview. Name Bouguereau's signature Sources on his full name are contradictory: it is sometimes given as William-Adolphe Bouguereau (composed name), William Adolphe Bouguereau (usual and civil-only names according to the French tradition), while in other occasions it appears as Adolphe William Bouguereau (with Adolphe as the usual name). However, he used to sign his works simply as William Bouguereau (hinting \\"William\\" was his given name, whatever the order), or more precisely as \\"W.Bouguereau.date\\" (French alphabet) and later as \\"W-BOVGVEREAV-date\\" (Latin alphabet).

It is an alternative term for prime minister, premier, chief minister, or first minister and very similar to the title of president of the council of ministers. Terminology In English-speaking countries, similar institutions may be called premiers or first ministers (typically at the subnational level) or prime ministers (typically at the national level). The plural is sometimes formed by adding an s to minister and sometimes by adding an s to president. The term is used, for instance, as a translation (calque) of the German word Ministerpr√§sident.common nouns are capitalized in German, though they are sometimes lowercased when referred to in English texts.  Austria  From 1867 to 1918, the first minister of the government was known as Ministerpr√§sident (minister-president), before that Staatskanzler (chancellor of state). Today the head of the Austrian Federal Government is called the Bundeskanzler (federal chancellor), while the head of a state government is called the Landeshauptmann (literally \\"state captain\\"), not Ministerpr√§sident. See: List of Ministers-President of Austria.  Belgium  The term minister-president (Dutch: minister-president, French: ministre- pr√©sident, German: Ministerpr√§sident) is also used in Belgium to describe the head of government of a Belgian region or linguistic community, but not the head of the Belgian federal government who is referred to as the prime minister (Dutch: eerste minister, French: premier ministre, German: Premierminister). According to the Belgian constitution, the federal prime minister is appointed by the king, and approved by the federal parliament with a vote of confidence (in practice the king usually appoints the leader of the winning party as \\"formateur\\" to form a government). The federal ministers later swear an oath of allegiance to the king. The ministers-president of the regions and linguistic communities are not appointed by the king, but are directly appointed by their respective parliament. Ministers of the regions and linguistic communities are not required to swear allegiance to the king but simply take an oath in their respective parliament. See: * Minister- President of the Brussels-Capital Region * Minister-President of Flanders * Minister-President of the French Community * Minister-President of the Walloon Region * Minister-President of the German-speaking Community  Germany  The Minister President (written Ministerpr√§sident in German) is the head of government of a state of Germany. On the federal level, the head of the federal government (with effectively identical function as leader of the cabinet) is called the Chancellor or Federal Chancellor (written Kanzler resp. Bundeskanzler in German).  Hungary  The title of Hungary's head of government in Hungarian is minisztereln√∂k which literally translated means \\"minister-president\\". However, because \\"prime minister\\" or \\"premier\\" is the more usual title in a parliamentary system for a head of government in English-speaking nations, \\"minisztereln√∂k\\" is almost always translated as \\"prime minister.\\"  Latvia  The Minister president is the head of government. \\"Minister-President\\" in the Constitution of Latvia of February 15, 1922, arose when the German term Ministerpr√§sident (minister-president) was translated; term ministru prezidents (in Latvian) was coined by the member of the Constitutional Assembly of Latvia, Latvian writer KƒÅrlis Skalbe.  Netherlands  In the Netherlands the prime minister is officially referred to as \\"minister-president\\", although the informal term \\"premier\\" is also frequently used. His responsibilities are defined in the constitution of 1848 as the \\"voorzitter van de ministerraad\\" (chair of the council of ministers). The title of minister-president has been in use since 1945 and officially added to the constitution in 1983.  Norway  In Norway, Vidkun Quisling, head of the collaborationist government from 1942 to 1945 during the German occupation in World War II, held the title of Minister-President (in Norwegian, ministerpresident).  Russian Republic  During a short lived Russian Republic, role of the Minister President was established. Alexander Kerensky was chosen to lead the provisional government.

He led the Coalition to defeat at the 1993 federal election. Hewson was born in Sydney. He has a doctorate in economics from Johns Hopkins University, and also has degrees from the University of Sydney and the University of Regina. Before entering politics, Hewson worked for periods as an economist for the Reserve Bank of Australia, as an economic advisor to the Fraser Government, as a business journalist, and as a director of the Macquarie Bank. In 1987, Hewson was elected to the House of Representatives. He was appointed to the shadow cabinet the following year, serving under John Howard and Andrew Peacock. After Peacock lost the 1990 election, Hewson was elected leader of the Liberal Party in his place, thus becoming Leader of the Opposition. In 1991, he launched the Fightback! policy manifesto, which proposed a series of major economic reforms with a goods and services tax (GST) as its centrepiece. The 1993 federal election focused mainly on economic policy, especially on how Australia should respond to the early 1990s recession. The Labor Party ‚Äì led by Paul Keating ‚Äì had been in power for 10 years at that point, and many polls suggested a Coalition victory. However, Labor was able to mount a successful countercampaign, with the party's net increase in seats allowing Keating to remain prime minister. Hewson continued on as Liberal leader for another year, losing a leadership spill to Alexander Downer in 1994. He left parliament the following year, but since then has remained a public figure as a business leader and political commentator. He resigned his membership of the Liberal Party in 2019, having been a critic of its policy direction for a number of years, particularly on climate change. Early life Hewson was born at Baroda Private Hospital in Carlton, Sydney, New South Wales. He was the first of four children born to Eileen Isabella (n√©e Tippett) and Donald Hewson. His mother was born in England and arrived in Australia at the age of six.Wallace (1993), p. 4. His father worked as a fitter and turner. Hewson spent his early years in Carlton, where his parents lived with his paternal grandmother and his father's three sisters.Wallace (1993), p. 5. His father eventually saved enough money to buy a house in Beverly Hills.Wallace (1993), p. 12. Hewson attended Carlton Primary School and Beverly Hills North Primary School before going on to Kogarah High School, leaving in 1963. He subsequently completed a Bachelor of Economics degree at the University of Sydney in 1967. He then gained a master's degree from the Regina, Canada, campus of the University of Saskatchewan (which since 1974 has been the University of Regina) and a second master's and a doctorate in economics from Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore. In 1967 he married Margaret Deaves.John Hewson: IMDb Professional career Returning to Australia, Hewson worked as an economist for the Reserve Bank of Australia. From 1976 to 1983 he was employed as an economic advisor to two successive Liberal treasurers; Phillip Lynch and John Howard. During this period he developed a keen interest in politics and was determined to enter politics himself.Our People ‚Äì Indigenous Chamber of Commerce While a strong Liberal, he was internally critical of what he saw as unconvincing and inconsistent economic Liberal Party policies.John Hewson ‚Äì panellist: ABC Q&A; He was a supporter of some of the economic policies of Margaret Thatcher.Briefings ‚Äì ALR, uow.edu.au November 1992 After the defeat of the Fraser government at the 1983 election, Hewson went into business journalism and became a director of a private bank, the Macquarie Bank. This allowed the Labor Party to tag him as \\"a wealthy banker\\" when he entered politics. Having divorced Margaret Deaves in 1985, in 1988 he remarried to Carolyn Somerville Margaret claims he left her because he reckoned she would not be able to cope with being a political wife.https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/122380850 Politics Hewson was elected at the 1987 election to the House of Representatives for the affluent Sydney electorate of Wentworth. Before his election he was told he would have to give up his Ferrari to get pre-selected. However, Hewson retained his car despite attracting controversy courtesy of it. He entered Parliament at a time when there was a leadership vacuum on the conservative side of politics. The Coalition, led by John Howard, lost the 1987 election and a majority of Liberal MPs voted to keep him as leader over his predecessor Andrew Peacock. In September 1988, Howard appointed Hewson shadow finance minister. In May 1989, when Andrew Peacock replaced Howard as Leader, Hewson became shadow treasurer. Prior to Howard's dumping, when Peacock was the shadow treasurer, Hewson had been seen as the real shadow treasurer. In the lead up to the 1990 election, Hewson, the trained economist, performed well against the then-Treasurer Paul Keating. Hewson claimed in December 1989 that Keating was reluctant to debate with him on the economy. =Election to leadership of the opposition= When Peacock was defeated at the 1990 elections, Hewson was elected to the Liberal leadership, despite having been in Parliament only three years. He had been one of the top players in the 1990 election campaign. Hewson defeated Peter Reith 62 votes to 13. Reith was then elected deputy leader, and Hewson made him Shadow Treasurer. =Fightback! economic policy= Shortly after the leadership change, Hewson made up ground on the Hawke government in the opinion polls, as the Australian economy struggled with the early 1990s recession. Hewson was determined to make a break with what he saw as the \\"weak pragmatism of past Liberal leaders.\\" In November 1991 the opposition launched the 650-page Fightback! policy document ‚àí a radical collection of \\"dry\\", economic liberal measures including the introduction of a Goods and Services Tax (GST), various changes to Medicare including the abolition of bulk billing for non-concession holders, the introduction of a nine-month limit on unemployment benefits, various changes to industrial relations including the abolition of awards, a $13 billion personal income tax cut directed at middle and upper income earners, $10 billion in government spending cuts, the abolition of state payroll taxes and the privatisation of a large number of government owned enterprises ‚àí representing the start of a very different future direction to the keynesian economic conservatism practiced by previous Liberal/National Coalition governments. The 15 percent GST was the centerpiece of the policy document. While Opposition leader Hewson, apart from supporting right wing economics, also supported abortion, gay rights and working mothers. In December 1991, Keating successfully challenged Hawke and became Prime Minister. Through 1992, Keating mounted a campaign against the Fightback package, and particularly against the GST, which he described as an attack on the working class in that it shifted the tax burden from direct taxation of the wealthy to indirect taxation as a broad-based consumption tax. Keating memorably described the impact of Hewson's GST as \\"15% on this, 15% on that\\", and Hewson as a \\"feral abacus.\\" This assault forced Dr Hewson into a partial backdown, agreeing not to levy the GST on food. But this concession opened Hewson to charges of weakness and inconsistency, and also complicated the arithmetic of the whole package, since the weakening of the GST reduced the scope for tax cuts, the most attractive element of the package for middle-class voters. The complications of the new package were famously demonstrated in the \\"birthday cake interview\\", in which Hewson was unable to answer a question posed by journalist Mike Willesee about whether or not a birthday cake would cost more or less under a Coalition government. Hewson was instead forced into a series of circumlocutions about whether the cake would be decorated, have ice cream in it and so on, considered by some as a turning point in the election campaign. In reference to the birthday cake interview in an August 2006 interview, Hewson said: \\"Well I answered the question honestly. The answer's actually right. That doesn't count...I should have told him (Mike Willesee) to get stuffed!\\". According to Channel 9's 20 to 1 episode Unscripted and Unplanned, the Birthday Cake Interview incident was the moment Hewson lost the election with the interview held 10 days before polling day.The article \\"Hot Pies, Cold Pies AND Pie-Eaters\\", by Alan Ramsey, Sydney Morning Herald, 6 March 1993 places the interview the \\"previous\\" Wednesday evening on the Nine Network's A Current Affair, which would make it 3 March 1993, 10 days before the election. However, polls right up to election day supported a Coalition victory. A number of the proposals were later adopted in to law in some form, to a small extent during the Keating Labor government, and to a larger extent during the Howard Liberal government (most famously the GST), while unemployment benefits and bulk billing were re-targeted for a time by the Abbott Liberal government. =Attack on Bob Carr= A notable event for Hewson in 1992, the year before the 1993 election was when he controversially attacked NSW Labor leader Bob Carr for his lack of family life when compared to Liberal Premier John Fahey: \\"You've got to be suspicious of a guy that doesn't drive, doesn't like kids and things like that. When he's up against a full-blooded Australian like John Fahey, he hasn't got a hope.\\", but was forced to withdraw the remark after a riposte by Keating.https://www.smh.com.au/national/throwing-baby-out-with-the-bathwater- on-questions-of-leadership-20070505-gdq2h2.html Carr and his wife Helena did not respond to Hewson's attack.https://books.google.com.au/books?id=jg- kIhwAezIC&pg;=PA80&lpg;=PA80&dq;=Bob+Carr+doesn%27t+drive+a+car+Hewson&source;=bl&ots;=gwXq4DZdHD&sig;=ACfU3U1fPCZ3HoQu4DSkKD5E4qNskAXHrQ&hl;=en&sa;=X&ved;=2ahUKEwic9onTw- _nAhUK9IUKHUgPCd8Q6AEwAXoECAoQAQ#v=onepage&q;=Bob%20Carr%20doesn't%20drive%20a%20car%20Hewson&f;=false =1993 federal election and aftermath= Keating won the 1993 election marking a record fifth consecutive Labor term, with Hewson losing what many had described as \\"the unloseable election\\" for the Liberals. The issue of the GST was dropped from the Liberal Party's agenda until the 1998 election campaign. Despite previously having pledged to resign the leadership in the event that he was defeated at the 1993 election, Hewson decided to continue in his position. He defeated a post-election party leadership challenge from John Howard and Bruce Reid after March 1993. However Hewson's leadership position was never secure from that point onward and political colleagues such as Peter Costello, Alexander Downer and Bronwyn Bishop consistently undermined his leadership over the subsequent year. With persistent questions over his leadership, his consistent response was that \\"leadership is not an issue\\". In 1993 Hewson in Parliament declared directly to Paul Keating that the passing of the Mabo act would be a day of shame for Australia, while also trying to find a solution for the Aborigines. Hewson never retracted his inflammatory remarks nor justified that language with any explanation of what solution he was seeking for Aborigines.https://www.theage.com.au/national/i-was-wrong-on- mabo-kennett-20020601-gdu9dt.html In 1994 Hewson declared Fightback! to be dead and buried. In May 1994, he was surprised by a party internal polling on an episode of Lateline. Later that month he attempted to quell leadership speculation in general by calling a leadership ballot for 23 May 1994, but he lost the vote and the leadership to Alexander Downer. Several days later Hewson joined Alexander Downer's shadow ministry as shadow minister for Industry, Commerce, Infrastructure and Customs. During August 1994 Downer dismissed him from the shadow ministry During January 1995, following a controversial joke about domestic violence policy several months prior, Downer at the risk of a leadership challenge from John Howard asked Hewson for his support against Howard. Hewson released a statement he would support either Downer or Howard for leadership on the condition he is their Shadow Treasuer which lead to Peter Costello stating that Hewsons days had passed.https://www.afr.com/politics/blast-from-past-sparks-fresh- librawl-19950124-k68bp Several days later Downer resigned as Liberal Leader and John Howard was then elected Liberal leader for the second time. In February 1995 Hewson resigned from Parliament, after having one of the shortest careers of any political party leader in Australian politics. He is the only Liberal leader to leave politics without serving as a minister but if he didn't resign he was speculated to be in a vulnerable position in a pre selection challengehttps://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/133338929?browse=ndp%3Abrowse%2Ftitle%2FC%2Ftitle%2F11%2F1995%2F02%2F28%2Fpage%2F14181026%2Farticle%2F133338929. Hewson stated in his resignation speech from Parliament while The Coalition may have won in 1993 had he not released Fightback! before the election he would of had trouble with the Senate in getting legislation through that he felt he needed to be up front to get a mandate.https://parlinfo.aph.gov.au/parlInfo/search/display/display.w3p;query=Id%3A%22chamber%2Fhansardr%2F1995-02-27%2F0049%22 Future prime minister and Hewson's former chief of staff Tony Abbott, who had just entered Parliament in the Warringah by-election, was among those who voted against Hewson in the May 1994 spill. In the immediate aftermath of the spill, Abbott told The 7.30 Report that Hewson should be remembered for his first three years as leader when he united the party following divisions with the Peacock-Howard rivalry, and not for his last twelve months.7.30 Report, 23 May 1994 Career after politics Since his departure from politics, he has written extensively for the business and general press, and spent time on the lecture circuit. In his writings he demonstrated an increasing focus on corporate social and environmental responsibility. In 2003-4 he chaired a community advisory committee to RepuTex, a new company that conducts assessments of companies on these criteria, as well as issuing an annual public listing of Australia's top 100 companies on these criteria.Australia behind in corporate social responsibility: World Today ABC 13 October 2003 =Business and academic activity= In 1995, Hewson was invited to join IT&T; Services as a non-executive director in one of his few private enterprise successes. IT&T; was a specialist IT and telecommunications design and project management group who delivered major technology projects for both corporate and government clients such as Citigroup, Department of Defence, News Limited and Ernst & Young across the Asia Pacific region. IT&T; Services was acquired by public company Powerlan Ltd in 2000.ASX, ASIC, PWR Annual report 2000 He became Professor of Management at Macquarie University, Sydney, and Dean of the Macquarie Graduate School of Management in 2002 but resigned within two years. While at Macquarie University, he also served as a consultant to ABN AMRO. In 2005, Hewson was elected onto the Touring Car Entrants Group of Australia (TEGA) board as an independent member. He left in June 2006 after a dispute with V8 Supercars Australia chairman Tony Cochrane. John Hewson held the position of chairman of the board of directors for the Elderslie Group, a company whose primary interests lie in the areas of corporate finance and property investments. Hewson touted investors in the group to increase their investment at a time when Elderslie was in difficulties but left them to face liquidation and big losses on their own when he resigned saying that he was unsatisfied with the direction the Group was heading in. On 2 July 2008, global accounting firm, PWC was appointed as receiver and administrator of the failed Elderslie Group. Since circa 2005, Hewson has been a member of the Trilateral Commission, an alliance of top political and economic leaders from North America, Asia-Pacific, and Europe. He is Chairman of General Security Australia Insurance Brokers Pty Ltd. In December 2012, Hewson was appointed as a non-executive director of Larus Energy, an oil and gas company developing operations in Papua New Guinea. =Political commentary= Hewson campaigning at the 2018 Wentworth by-election After 1996 Hewson became increasingly critical of Prime Minister John Howard. In 2003 he opposed Howard's decision to take part in the Iraq War although in 2004 argued it would be electoral \\"suicide\\" for the Liberal Party to replace Howard with an alternate leader at the time.Australia's role in Iraq war an ‚Äòembarrassment‚Äô, John Hewson tells Q&A; ‚Äì Herald Sun 13 July 2015Leader change 'suicidal': Hewson ‚Äì The Age 9 March 2004 In July 2006, Hewson gave an interview to ABC's Four Corners program in which he voiced concern at the growing influence of what he characterised as a \\"hardline right religious element\\" in the NSW branch of the Liberal Party. This was in breach of a Liberal Party rule about speaking to the media and reports at the time claimed he could face expulsion from the party. Hewson has repeatedly appeared in television interviews and on political panels and has been a regular columnist for the Australian Financial Review since 2004. In 2011, he and former Liberal prime minister Malcolm Fraser were among 140 Australian community leaders who pledged support for an Emissions trading scheme, despite the fact the Coalition and its leader Tony Abbott (Hewson's former Press Secretary) opposed the carbon tax. = Departure from the Liberal Party = In a 2019 interview on Sky News in which Hewson was speaking alongside Greens MP Adam Bandt, Hewson admitted he was no longer a member of the Liberal Party, stating he let his membership 'lapse'. He has criticised various Liberal Party members including former Prime Minister Tony Abbott and current Prime Minister Scott Morrison due to their poor record on climate action. Hewson publicly campaigned for a price on carbon, something introduced by the Gillard Labor Government and opposed by the Liberal Party's then leader Tony Abbott. =Awards= In 2000, Hewson was honoured as a Member of the Order of Australia.

The agreement phased out a wide range of trade restrictions in stages over a ten-year period, and resulted in a substantial increase in cross-border trade as an improvement to the last replaced trade dealhttps://www.nbcnews.com/business/economy/trump-signs-usmca-trade-deal- replace-nightmare-nafta-n1125526. With the addition of Mexico in 1994, FTA was superseded by the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) (French: Accord de libre-√©change Nord Am√©ricain (ALENA), Spanish: Tratado de Libre Comercio de Am√©rica del Norte (TLCAN)). As stated in the agreement, the main purposes of the Canadian-United States Free Trade Agreement were: *Eliminate barriers to trade in goods and services between Canada and the United States *Facilitate conditions of fair competition within the free-trade area established by the Agreement *Significantly liberalize conditions for investment within that free-trade area *Establish effective procedures for the joint administration of the Agreement and the resolution of disputes *Lay the foundation for further bilateral and multilateral cooperation to expand and enhance the benefits of the Agreement History =Background= Starting in 1855, while Canada was under British control, free trade was implemented between the colonies of British North America and the United States under the Reciprocity Treaty. In 1866, a year before Canadian Confederation, the United States Congress voted to cancel the treaty. Canada's first Prime Minister, John A. Macdonald, the protectionist National Policy attempted and failed to reinstate reciprocity, after which the government moved to a more protectionist policy. Fears grew among many politicians that closer economic ties with the United States would lead to political annexation. The Liberal Party of Canada had traditionally supported free trade. Free trade in natural products was a central issue in the 1911 Canadian federal election. The Conservative Party campaigned using anti-American rhetoric, and the Liberals lost the election. The issue of free trade did not rise to this level of national prominence in Canada again for many decades. From 1935 to 1980, the two nations entered a number of bilateral trade agreements that greatly reduced tariffs in both nations.[\\"Wine Trade with Canada\\". Berkeley Journal of International Law, Vol 7, Issue 1, page 106. by R Mendelson The most significant of these agreements was the 1960s Automotive Products Trade Agreement (also known as the Auto Pact). After the signing of the Auto Pact, the Canadian Government considered proposing free-trade agreements in other sectors of the economy. However, the United States government was less receptive to this idea, and in fact, wanted to phase out some guarantees in the Pact. Canadian attention turned to the question of a broader free-trade agreement between the two countries.Michael Hart, with Bill Dymond and Colin Robertson, Decision at Midnight; Inside the Canada‚ÄìUS Free Trade Negotiations. Vancouver: UBC [University of British Columbia] Press, 1994, esp. pp. 57‚Äì62. During the next two decades, a number of academic economists studied the effects of a free trade agreement between the two countries. Several of them‚ÄîRonald Wonnacott and Paul Wonnacott,Ronald Wonnacott and Paul Wonnacott, Free Trade Between The United States And Canada: The Potential Economic Effects. Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1967. and Richard G. Harris and David CoxRichard G. Harris with David Cox, Trade, Industrial Policy, and Canadian Manufacturing. Toronto: Ontario Economic Council, 1984.‚Äîconcluded that Canadian real GDP would be significantly increased if both U.S. and Canadian tariffs and other trade barriers were removed and Canadian industry could consequently produce at larger, more efficient scale. Other economists on the free-trade side included John Whalley of the University of Western Ontario and Richard Lipsey of the C. D. Howe Institute.Hart, Dymond, and Robertson, pp. 4‚Äì5, 29‚Äì34. Others were concerned that free trade would have negative effects, fearing capital flight and job insecurity because of international outsourcing, and also that closer economic ties with the Giant to the South might risk an erosion of Canadian sovereignty. Opponents included Mel Watkins of the University of Toronto and David Crane of the Toronto Star, one of Canada's leading newspapers. A number of government studies drew increasing attention to the possibility of a bilateral free-trade negotiation: Looking Outward (1975), by the Economic Council of Canada; several reports of the Senate Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs (1975, 1978, and 1982); and the 1985 report of the Macdonald Commission (formally, the Royal Commission on the Economic Union and Development Prospects for Canada), chaired by former Liberal politician Donald Stovel Macdonald. Macdonald declared that \\"Canadians should be prepared to take a leap of faith\\"As quoted by Hart, Dymond, and Robertson, p. 34 and pursue more open trade with the United States. Although Macdonald was a former Liberal Minister of Finance, the commission's findings were embraced by Prime Minister Brian Mulroney's Progressive Conservative Party, even though they had opposed a free-trade initiative in the 1984 Canadian election campaign. The stage was set for the beginning of free-trade negotiations.\\"Reagan, Mulrooney enjoyed a rare personal bond\\". Buffalo News, By Janet Larkin. June 20, 2004 =Negotiations= US President Ronald Reagan welcomed the Canadian initiative and the United States Congress gave the President the authority to sign a free trade agreement with Canada, subject to it being presented for Congressional review by October 5, 1987. In May 1986, Canadian and American negotiators began to work out a trade deal. The Canadian team was led by former deputy Minister of Finance Simon Reisman and the American side by Peter O. Murphy, the former deputy United States trade representative in Geneva. The agreement between the two countries ultimately created substantially liberalized trade between them, removing most remaining tariffs, although tariffs were only a minor part of the FTA. Average tariffs on goods crossing the border were well below 1% by the 1980s. Instead, Canada desired unhindered access to the American economy. Americans, in turn, wished to have access to Canada's energy and cultural industries. In the negotiations, Canada retained the right to protect its cultural industries and such sectors as education and health care. As well, some resources such as water were meant to be left out of the agreement. The Canadians did not succeed in winning free competition for American government procurement contracts. Canadian negotiators also insisted on the inclusion of a dispute resolution mechanism.\\"After 25 years, free-trade deal with U.S. has helped Canada grow up\\". The Globe and Mail, John Ibbitson, Ottawa. September 29, 2012 =Debate and implementation= The debate in Canada over whether to implement the negotiated agreement was very contentious. The opposition Liberal Party of Canada under leader John Turner vociferously opposed the agreement, saying that he would \\"tear it up\\" if he became prime minister. The opposition New Democratic Party under leader Ed Broadbent also strongly opposed the agreement. Both parties objected that the agreement would erode Canadian sovereignty, arguing that Canada would effectively become the \\"51st state\\" of the US if the agreement was implemented. They also raised concerns about how Canada's social programs and other trade agreements such as the Auto Pact would be affected.See Christopher Waddell, \\"Policy and Partisanship on the Campaign Trail: How Mulroney Works His Magic Twice\\", ch. 1 of R.B. Blake, Transforming The Nation: Canada and Brian Mulroney (2007) at p. 22 The legislation to implement the agreement was delayed in the Senate, which had a Liberal Party majority. Partly in response to these delays, Mulroney called an election in 1988. Trade Agreement was by far the most prominent issue of the campaign, prompting some to call it the \\"Free Trade Election.\\" It was the first Canadian election to feature large third-party campaign advertising, with supporters and opponents using lobbyists to buy television advertisements. It was also the first Canadian election to use much negative advertising; one anti-free-trade advertisement showed negotiators \\"removing a line\\" from the Free Trade Agreement, which at the end of the advertisement was revealed to be the Canada‚ÄìUS border. Although some opinion polls showed slightly more Canadians against the Agreement than in favour of it, Mulroney's Progressive Conservatives benefited from being the only party in favour of the agreement, while the Liberals and NDP split the anti-free trade vote. In addition, future Quebec Premiers Jacques Parizeau and Bernard Landry backed the agreement which was seen as a factor for the PC party support in Quebec. Mulroney won a governing majority and the agreement was passed into law even if a majority of the voters had voted for parties opposing free trade.Jean Raby. \\"The Investment Provisions of the Canada‚ÄîUnited States Free Trade Agreement: A Canadian Perspective\\". The American Journal of International Law. Volume 84, Issue 2. April 1990 , pp. 394-443\\"The New Life of Brian Mulroney\\". The Walrus, Ira Wells, Apr. 19, 2018 The Free Trade Agreement faced much less opposition in the US. Polls showed that up to 40% of Americans were unaware that the agreement had been signed. The Agreement implementation act was given to the Congress for \\"fast-track\\" approve by President Reagan on July 26, 1988, meaning that it could be accepted or rejected but could not be amended. the United States-Canada Free-Trade Agreement Implementation Act of 1988 is passed to in House by Yea-Nay Vote: 366 - 40 passed to in the House on August 9, 1988 and it is passed to in Senate by Yea-Nay Vote. 83-9 on September 19, 1988.Actions Overview H.R.5090 ‚Äî 100th Congress (1987-1988)All Information (Except Text) The act is signed by President on September 28, 1988 and became Public Law No: 100-449. Effects The exact ramifications of the agreement are hard to measure. Trade between Canada and the U.S., which had already been on the rise, increased at an accelerated rate after the agreement was signed.\\"Not just the FTA: Factors affecting growth in Canada-United States Trade since 1988\\". Michael Holden, Economics Division, Government of Canada. 4 March 2003 While throughout the 20th century, exports fairly consistently made up about 25% of Canada's gross domestic product (GDP), since 1990 exports have been about 40% of GDP. After 2000, they reached nearly 50%. A 2016 paper estimates \\"that CUSFTA increased the yearly profits of Canadian manufacturing by 1.2%\\". Often, analyses of the free trade agreement find that its effects on the two countries depend on the difference in value between the Canadian dollar and the US dollar. In 1990‚Äì1991, the Canadian dollar rose sharply in value against the US dollar, making Canadian manufactured goods much more expensive for Americans to buy and making American manufactured goods much cheaper for Canadians, who no longer had to pay high duties on them. The phenomenon of \\"cross-border shopping\\", where Canadians would make shopping daytrips to US border towns to take advantage of tariff-free goods and a high Canadian dollar, provided a mini-boom for these towns. The loss of many Canadian jobs, particularly in the Ontario manufacturing sector during the recession of the early 1990s, was attributed (fairly or not) to the Free Trade Agreement. In the mid-to-late 1990s, however, the Canadian dollar fell to record lows in value to against the US dollar. Cheaper Canadian primary products such as lumber and oil could be bought tariff-free by Americans, and Hollywood studios sent their crews to film many movies in Canada due to the cheap Canadian dollar (see \\"runaway production\\" and \\"Hollywood North\\"). The removal of protective tariffs meant that market forces, such as currency values, have a greater effect on the economies of both countries than they would have with tariffs. The agreement has failed to liberalize trade in some areas, most notably the ongoing dispute over softwood lumber. Issues such as mineral, fresh water, and softwood lumber trade still remain disputed. While the agreement remains decades later, it is no longer at the forefront of Canadian politics.\\"Guest Editorial: Case for TPP must be made on Main Street\\". The Edmonton Journal, 10.09.2015 It was superseded by the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) in 1994. The Liberals under Jean Chr√©tien were elected to office in the 1993 election, partly on a promise to renegotiate key labor and environmental parts of NAFTA. An agreement was indeed struck with the Democrats under Bill Clinton that created separate side deals to address both of these concerns. References *Derek Burney, Getting it Done: A Memoir.

Because eruptive activity ceased 250,000 years ago, glaciers have heavily eroded the volcano's structure, creating precipitous slopes and a horn-like peak. The spire-like shape of Thielsen attracts lightning strikes and creates fulgurite, an unusual mineral. The prominent horn forms a centerpiece for the Mount Thielsen Wilderness, a reserve for recreational activities such as skiing and hiking. Thielsen was produced by subduction of the Juan de Fuca Plate under the North American Plate. Volcanism near the Cascades dates back to 55 million years ago (mya), and extends from British Columbia to California. Thielsen is part of the High Cascades, a branch of the main Cascades range that includes several Oregon volcanoes less than 3.5 million years old; it is also a member of a group of extinct volcanoes distinguished by their sharp peaks. The area surrounding the volcano was originally inhabited Klamath Native Americans, and was later encountered by settlers. One of the visitors was Jon Hurlburt, an early explorer of the area who named the volcano after the engineer Hans Thielsen. Later explorers discovered nearby Crater Lake. The volcano was not analyzed until 1884, when a team from the United States Geological Survey sampled its fulgurite deposits.  History  Mount Thielsen seen from the south in the 1930s The area was originally inhabited by Chinook Native Americans, who referred to the mountain as \\"Hischokwolas\\"; the Klamath call it \\"hisc'akwaleeas\\". Jon Hurlburt, a Polish explorer, renamed the volcano after Hans Thielsen, a railroad engineer and builder who played a major role in the construction of the California and Oregon Railroad.Heer and Heer, p. 47. In 1884 a United States Geological Survey team headed by J. S. Diller began studying the mountains of the Cascade Range. Their intended destinations included Thielsen, which was climbed and sampled for its fulgurite variant. Thielsen's spire-like top is hit by lightning so frequently that some rocks on the summit have melted into a rare mineraloid known as lechatelierite, a variety of fulgurite. The mountain has earned the nickname \\"the lightning rod of the Cascades\\". Apart from study, Thielsen and the rest of the Crater Lake area features heavily into 19th- and early 20th century exploration. In 1853, miners from Yreka first described Crater Lake; one called it \\"the bluest water he had ever seen\\", another \\"deep blue lake\\". The first published description was written by Chauncy Nye for the Jacksonville Sentinel in 1862. Nye recalled an expedition of gold prospectors where they passed a lake of a deep blue color. Native Americans lived in the area and grew irritable towards new settlers in the area. In 1865, Fort Klamath was built as a protective sanctuary. A wagon road was built to connect the Rogue Valley to the fort. In late 1865, two hunters ventured upon the lake; more explorers followed. By then, the lake became famous for its distinctive color, and crowds flocked to see it. The first known non-Native American to stand on the shore of Crater Lake was Sergeant Orsen Stearns, who climbed down into the caldera. A friend, Captain F.B. Sprague, gave it the name \\"Lake Majesty\\". Tourism continued until May 22, 1902; on that day, Theodore Roosevelt designated the lake and surrounding area a national park.  Geography  = Regional = The Juan de Fuca Plate is being subducted under the North American Plate, generating gradual, diverse volcanism. The Cascade Range was produced by convergence of the North American Plate with the subducting Juan de Fuca Plate. Active volcanism has taken place for approximately 36 million years; the nearby Challis Range features complexes as old as 55 mya. Most geologists believe that activity in the Cascades has been relatively intermittent, producing up to 3,000 volcanic calderas at a time. Frequent volcanism within the last 10,000 years created complexes from Mount Garibaldi in British Columbia to north California's Lassen Peak complex. Remarkably different from state to state, the volcanism ranges from large volcanoes to zones of many smaller geologic features such as lava shields and cinder cones. Volcanic peaks of the Cascade Mountains are grouped into two ranges, called the High Cascades and the Western Cascades; Thielsen is part of the High Cascades, which are east of the Western Cascades. = Local = This map of the Southern Oregon Cascade Range lists several of the major volcanoes around Thielsen. Diamond Lake, formed by one of Thielsen's eruptions,Molhlenbrock. lies to the west of Mount Thielsen and beyond lies Mount Bailey, a much less eroded and younger stratovolcano. Thielsen's sharp peak is a prominent feature of the skyline visible from Crater Lake National Park. All three volcanoes are part of the Oregon High Cascades, a range that sections off the stratovolcanoes of Oregon that are younger than 3.5 million years. The High Cascades include Mount Jefferson, the Three Sisters, Broken Top, and other stratovolcanoes and remnants. Rock in the area ages from the Upper Pliocene and Quaternary. Basalt and basaltic andesite comprise newer volcanoes atop the High Cascades: Major volcanic centers include Mount Hood, Three Sisters / Broken Top, Mount Mazama (Crater Lake), and Mount Jefferson. All have produced diverse eruptions, including both lava flows and pyroclastic eruptions, and variability in composition between dacite, basalt, and even rhyolite (except for Mount Hood, which is not known to have produced rhyolite). Thielsen is part of a series of extinct volcanoes in Oregon termed pyramidal peaks or \\"the Matterhorns\\" for their steep, spire-like summits; Thielsen is the highest at . Other Matterhorns include Mount Washington, Three Fingered Jack, Mount Bailey, and Diamond Peak. Unlike other mountains in the High Cascades, all these volcanoes became extinct 250,000‚Äì100,000 years ago, and their summits endured the last few ice ages, accounting for their distinct shapes.  Geology  Aerial view of Mount Thielsen Thielsen has been so deeply eroded by glaciers that there is no summit crater and the upper part of the mountain is more or less a horn. Thielsen is a relatively old Cascade volcano, and cone-building eruptions stopped relatively early. Erosion caused during the last two or three ice ages remains visible. Subsidence of the last material in Thielsen's crater moved its youngest lava more than above the active crater.Diller & Patton, p. 21. On the mountain past lava flows are diverse, some as thick as , others as thin as . Stack-like figures composed of breccia and past flow deposits are as thick as . The placement of these flows suggest that they were generated by splatter emitted by fountains in the cone. On the sides of the mountain are bands of palagonite, a clay formed from iron-rich tephra making up the body of the volcano. Basalt taken from the volcano contained pyroxene, hypersthene material, and feldspars.Clarke, p. 166. Other notable formations in the vicinity include Howlock Mountain, Windigo Butte, and Tolo Mountain. Other than Crater Lake, little water flows on the surface, but small streams have formed in canyons excavated by glaciers. = Composition = The volcanic cone of Mount Thielsen sits atop prior shield volcanoes, and has a volume of . The cone was built from basaltic andesite, a common component of other shield volcanoes in the Oregon Cascades, breccia, and tuff, and it is intruded by dikes.Bishop and Allen, p. 121. A coalesced volcanic cone, it formed as pyroclastics erupted and fountains spewed lava. Glaciers cut and deformed the cone, eroding its upper sector. This erosion opened the interior of Thielsen for observation. Within the cone, lava flows, pyroclastic flow deposits, and strata of tephra, and volcanic ash, are easily visible. Potassium-argon dating of deposits in the cone suggests that Thielsen is at least 290,000 years old. Since its eruption stopped about 250,000‚Äì100,000 years ago, the period of eruptive activity was short in time. The eruptions of the cone came in three phases: a period where lava flows built up its cone, one where more explosive pyroclastic eruptions took place, and the final period, in which pyroclastic and material of lava-based origin were erupted together forming a weak cone encircled by long deposits. = Glaciation = Glaciers were present on the volcano until the conclusion of the Little Ice Age, at the beginning of the 20th century. Pleistocene glaciers have largely eroded Thielsen's caldera, exposing its contents. The small Lathrop Glacier in the northern cirque of the volcano is the only extant glacier on Mount Thielsen. While the glaciation was extensive, volcanic ash from eruptive activity at Mount Mazama has almost certainly masked contents. = Fulgurites = Fulgurites (substances that form when lightning melts rock)Harris, pp. 157‚Äì165. on the volcano are restricted to the very pinnacle of the mountain, and are only found between the top and of its summit. Lightning strikes the summit regularly, creating patches of \\"brownish black to olive-black glass\\" that resemble \\"greasy splotches of enamel paint\\". These range from a few centimeters in diameter to long, narrow lines up to long. Their appearance also varies: While some patches are rough and spongy, others are flat. Inspection of the fulgurite reveals a homogenous glass over a layer of basalt; in between, a stratum made of materials such as feldspar, pyroxene, and olivine exists.  Ecology  Mule deer are known to inhabit the forest around Thielsen. A grove of enormous incense cedars exists near Diamond Lake, and there is a forest of ponderosa pine at the nearby Emile Big Tree Trail. The Umpqua National Forest features swordferns and Douglas firs. Rocky Mountain elks, pronghorns, and mule deer, bobcats, black bears, and mountain lions live in the Fremont‚ÄìWinema National Forest. The forest's rivers support populations of trout, and the lakes contain fish such as the largemouth bass. The forest is inhabited by avian species such as mallards, American bald eagles, Canada geese, and whistling swans. Peregrine falcons and Warner suckers also infrequently enter its boundaries. The lower slopes of Mount Thielsen are heavily forested, with low diversity of plant species. A forest of mountain hemlock and fir grows up to the timberline at about . Near the peak of the volcano, whitebark pine prevails.  Recreation  Mount Thielsen lies in the southern section of the Mount Thielsen Wilderness, which is part of the Deschutes, Umpqua and Fremont‚ÄìWinema national forests. On the west, the wilderness borders the Oregon Cascades Recreation Area, a area set aside by Congress in 1984. The wilderness and forests offer several activities related to the mountain, such as hiking and skiing. The wilderness covers around the volcano, featuring lakes and alpine parks.Grubbs, p. 187. It also contains of the Pacific Crest National Scenic Trail, accessible from a trailhead along Oregon Highway 138. In 2009 the trail was selected as Oregon's best hike. Three skiing trails exist on the mountain, all of black diamond rating. They follow several trails through the wilderness from the bowl of the mountain.

Bailey consists of a -high main cone on top of an old basaltic andesite shield volcano. With a volume of , Mount Bailey is slightly smaller than neighboring Diamond Peak.Wood and Kienle, p. 191. Mount Bailey is a popular destination for recreational activities. Well known in the Pacific Northwest region as a haven for skiing in the winter months, the mountain's transportation, instead of a conventional chairlift, is provided by snowcats‚Äîtreaded, tractor-like vehicles that can ascend Bailey's steep, snow-covered slopes and carry skiers to the higher reaches of the mountain. In the summer months, a hiking trail gives foot access to Bailey's summit. Native Americans are credited with the first ascents of Bailey. Spiritual leaders held feasts and prayer vigils on the summit.McArthur, p. 664.  Etymology  The origin of the mountain's name is a matter of dispute. Older maps show its name as either \\"Old Baldy\\" or \\"Old Bailey\\", \\"Bailey\\" possibly being a drafting error. The summit's bald, burnt- over appearance might indicate the origin of the designation \\"Baldy\\". No record of a person named Bailey who was connected with the peak has been found. In 1992 the Oregon Geographic Names Board voted to name the mountain in honor of naturalists Vernon and Florence Bailey. According to William G. Steel, the Klamath name for the mountain was Youxlokes, which means \\"Medicine Mountain\\". According to Klamath tradition, their medicine men and priests would feast on the mountain's summit and commune with the upper world.  Geography and geology  Mount Bailey is part of the High Cascades in the western United States. The High Cascades have long been glaciated, by both Pacific-bred storms and natural, elevation-caused, glaciation. In fact, glaciation probably formed on them as early as the late Miocene. Over time, as the range built up, newer activity diminished older Tertiary age rock. Creating lava plateaus, Pliocene activity, mostly basaltic and andesitic, was probably responsible for the original cones at Bailey, Thielsen, and Union Peak.Harris, Tuttle, and Tuttle, p. 536. Mount Bailey heads the Mount Bailey chain, which consists of the mountain and smaller cinder cones trending north. Similarly to its neighbor Mount Thielsen, it is a shield volcano with precipitous summit slopes. Built around the same time as Rodley Butte, according to morphological study, the current volcano is no more than 100,000 years old, and formed relatively close to Diamond Peak's current cone. Despite its similarity to Rodley Butte, both in age and original composition, Bailey switched from erupting basaltic andesite to andesite.Wood and Kienle, pp. 190‚Äì191. Bailey is comprised by a central tephra cone, upon which basaltic andesite eruptions streamed over, building up to create the current volcano. Eventually switching to andesite, it may have been built over several eruptions or even eruptive periods, judging from the silicic nature of its rock. It is currently inactive, having been since approximately the time Mount Mazama became active, sometime in the early Pleistocene epoch.Harris, Tuttle, and Tuttle, p. 530.  Ecology and recreation  A snowmobile trail between Mount Bailey and Diamond Lake; Mount Bailey is showing through the trees in the background. Diverse flora exists on Mount Bailey. Starting at the lower slopes, the prominent tree type is standard pine, eventually changing to a landscape of mountain hemlock, western white pine, and Shasta fir. Bailey is a popular hiking and skiing site, due to its steep climbs and views of Diamond Lake. It is accessible from Oregon Route 230, starting at the Fox Spring trailhead.Bernstein, p. 31. Following the Mount Bailey Trail, part of the Diamond Lake Recreational Area,Dunegan, p. 157. hikers can see \\"panoramas to the northeast of Diamond Lake and Bailey's dizzying avalanche bowl\\".Bernstein, p. 32.

Five people died in the accident.First NTSB report on the investigation into the crash of N554PR. Retrieved: 14 August 2008. and the remaining people were injured.  Aircraft and crew  The flight was operated by a de Havilland DH.114 Heron 2B aircraft, registration number N554PR. The aircraft was almost fully loaded, with eighteen passengers and a crew of two on board.The two NTSB accident reports used as sources describe N554PR as being modified to have 20 passenger seats. The flight was under the command of Captain Donald Price (28), a very experienced airman who had clocked approximately 8,300 total flight hours, more than 3,000 of which were accrued in the aircraft type. The first officer was Gary Belejeu (27). Far less experienced than the captain, Belejeu had logged roughly 1,400 total flight hours, with 102 hours in the DH-114.http://libraryonline.erau.edu/online-full-text/ntsb/aircraft-accident- reports/AAR75-17.pdf  Flight and accident  The flight was uneventful up to the moment of landing. As the flight was late at night, the control tower at Mercedita Airport was closed, therefore the flight crew was responsible for the landing clearance. Just after touching down on the runway at Mercedita Airport the flight crew made a decision to go around. The pilot over-rotated the aircraft and caused it to stall at a low level and crash; three passengers and the two flight crew members died, the other fifteen passengers were injured, seven seriously. Heavy fog was also a contributing factor in this accident.  Investigation  The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) investigation concluded that the probable cause was the \\"presence of an unauthorized vehicle on the runway which caused the pilot to attempt a go- around after touchdown to avoid a collision. The maneuver resulted in an overrotation of the aircraft at too low an airspeed to sustain flight\\". This was based on eyewitness accounts of a set of lights visible on the runway as Flight 191 approached, and other eyewitness accounts of a vehicle owned by the Puerto Rico Ports Authority being parked shortly after the accident and the driver acting in a suspicious manner. Three years after the accident the NTSB was compelled to re-open the investigation into the crash, after submissions were received that the person who was suspected of driving the \\"unauthorized vehicle\\" had actually left the airport about fifteen minutes before the aircraft crashed. The second investigation concluded that there was no airport vehicle on the runway, and that the reason for the go-around of the aircraft was unknown; a new report was issued, explaining the evidence as to the location of the airport vehicle and amending the Probable Cause to remove reference to a vehicle being on the runway.Second NTSB report on the crash of N554PR.

The district is centred on Milton Keynes Village, the village that gave its name to modern Milton Keynes, which surrounds it extensively. The village also gives its name to the local civil parish, of which Middleton is the more populated district. It is delineated by Childs Way to the north, Tongwell Street to the east, Chaffron Way to the south and Brickhill Street to the west. The River Ouzel runs diagonally through it, from west to north. History The village was originally known as Middeltone (11th century); then later as Middelton Kaynes or Caynes (13th century); Milton Keynes (15th century); and Milton alias Middelton Gaynes (17th century). After the Norman invasion, the de Cahaines family held the manor from 1166 to the late 13th century as well as others in the country (Ashton Keynes in Wiltshire, Somerford Keynes in Gloucestershire, and Horsted Keynes in West Sussex). During this time the village became known as Middleton de Keynes eventually shortening to 'Milton Keynes'. The original core village of the district, along Walton Road and Broughton Road, has retained its \\"Milton Keynes\\" road signs and has an attractive collection of rural village houses and a thatched pub which dates back to the 13th century. It is now known as \\"Milton Keynes Village\\". Education The district has two schools, Middleton Primary School and Oakgrove School, a secondary comprehensive. Both were built in the early 2000s, in the south-west of the district. Civil parish Early in the development of Milton Keynes (the 'city'), the district (in which the original village lies and after which it was named) was given the name Middleton again. However, the civil parish is still formally called Milton Keynes, and has a joint parish council with Broughton, Broughton and Milton Keynes Parish Council.Parishes in Milton Keynes - Milton Keynes Council.

The program allows users to virtually travel through a computer generated universe. Celestia can display objects of various scales using OpenGL.There are three graphical front-ends available: GLUT, GTK+ or Qt. Celestia is available for AmigaOS 4, Linux, macOS, and Microsoft Windows, with beta versions for iOS and Android. It is free and open source software released under the GNU General Public License. Celestia's development stopped in 2013, with the final release in 2011. Since then, some of its development team went to work on Celestia.sci, a cosmological visualizer. In late 2016, the official Celestia forums were restored, and development restarted. As of 2020 beta testing builds of version 1.7.0 are available, as well as the bugfix release 1.6.2. Celestia is available for download from free software websites. Between 2001 and May 2017, the former central distribution site SourceForge counted approximately 12 million downloads. Functions DSO survey in Celestia Celestia displays the Hipparcos Catalogue (HIP) of 118,322 stars and a compiled catalogue of galaxies. Celestia uses the VSOP87 theory of planetary orbits to provide a solar and lunar eclipse finder and to display the orbital paths of planets (including extrasolar planets), dwarf planets, moons, asteroids, comets, artificial satellites, and spacecraft. Using the installed catalogues, the names of celestial objects can be displayed, including artificial satellites, as well as the names and locations of Earth features. Celestia allows users to navigate at different speeds, and allow users to orbit stars, planets, moons, and other space objects, track space objects such as spacecraft, asteroids, and comets as they fly by, or travel to and/or fly through galaxies. Light time delay is an optional function. The time simulated by Celestia can be set to any time 2 billion years forward or backward from the present, although planetary orbits are only accurate within a few thousand years of the present day, and Celestia simulates the appearance of atmospheres on planets and moons, planetshine on orbiting satellites, and miscellaneous planetary details such as sunrise and sunset. Information about the objects that Celestia draws can also be displayed. The user can change Celestia's field of view, and allows users to split the window into multiple panes. Screenshots and movies can be captured in classic or HD resolutions. Celestia's support for gamepads and joysticks is relatively limited. Celestia can be extended with new objects, and has support for third-party, user- created add-ons available for installation, both fictional and realistic. The extension mechanism uses Lua as its built-in scripting language. Limitations Celestia's rendition of TrES-4b The default setting for Celestia's Earth is a spheroid. The irregular surface of the Earth causes low Earth orbit satellites to appear to be in the wrong places in the sky when watched from Celestia's ground, even when the Earth's oblateness is specified. Many types of astronomical objects are not included with Celestia. Variable stars, supernovae, black holes, and nebulae are missing from the standard distribution. Some are available as add-ons. Although objects that form part of a planetary system move, and stars rotate about their axes and orbit each other in multiple star systems, stellar proper motion is not simulated, and galaxies are at fixed locations. As a result, the constellations in Celestia do not gradually change shape as they do in the real world. In addition, Celestia's binary star catalogs only describe a few hundred systems of multiple stars. Most binary star systems cannot be simulated because adequate orbital information is not yet available. Celestia does not include any stars that are more than a few thousand light-years from the Sun because the parallaxes of more distant stars are too small to be accurately measured by the Hipparcos astrometric satellite. In addition, objects in solar systems are only drawn to a distance of one light-year from their suns, and Celestia does not consider the wobbling of some stars induced by their planets. Wavelength filtering is not implemented in Celestia's engine. The actual rendering tries to match human vision at the observer's position as accurately as possible. This means false-color maps and multi-color nebulae are not part of the official distribution. Camera artifacts such as lens flare and glare are not rendered. Celestia also does not simulate gravity. For example, a near-Earth object approaching the Earth will not be deflected by the Earth's gravity unless the person who defined the NEO's trajectory for Celestia included that effect. Some moons do not cast shadows on their planet during eclipses. This is because irregularly shaped objects do not cast shadows in the current version of Celestia, although this is planned for future versions. Most real- world spacecraft such as Voyager 2 are not available in Celestia but are provided as add-ons by users. Celestia uses the Julian calendar and cannot go back or forward more than 2 billion years, and the default time-setting system cannot go further than the years -9999 or 9999. Add-ons A high-resolution texture of the planet Mars A high-resolution texture of the Moon, including a normal map Well over 10 GB of extensions are available in addition to the base program, produced by an active user community. Higher resolution surface textures are available for most solar system bodies, including Virtual Textures with coverage up to 32768 pixels wide (1.25 km/pixel at the Earth's equator), with selected coverage at higher resolutions. This allows closer views of the Earth, Mars, and the Moon. 3D models of historical and existing spacecraft are available flying in reasonably accurate trajectories, such as Sputnik 1, Voyager 2, the Hubble Space Telescope, and the International Space Station, as are extended data plots for stars (2 million with correct spatial coordinates), DSOs (nebulae, galaxies, open clusters, etc.), as well as catalogs of asteroids and comets, and more than 96,000 locations on the Earth can be drawn by the program. Add-ons also include space objects such as red and blue supergiants, red and brown dwarfs, neutron stars, spinning pulsars, rotating black holes with accretion disks, protostars, star nursery nebulae, supernova remnants, planetary nebulae, galactic redshifts, geological planetary displays (e.g. 3D interiors, topographic and bathymetric maps, paleogeography), planetary aurorae, rotating magnetic fields, animated solar prominences, 3D craters and mountains, and historic collision events. Numerous scripts are available. These include simple tours, reconstructions of complex space missions such as Cassini‚ÄìHuygens and Deep Impact, and scripts showing useful information, like size comparisons, or particular events such as multiple simultaneous eclipses of Jupiter's moons or the evolution of a star. Fictional universes can be depicted, with planetary systems and 3D models‚Äîfilms such as 2001: A Space Odyssey, Star Trek and Star Wars, and TV shows including Stargate SG-1 and Babylon 5. Add-ons illustrating less well- known Web fiction, like Orion's Arm, or role-playing games, like 2300 AD, and personal works by members of the Celestia community depicting fictional solar systems with inhabited worlds, spacecraft, cities, and special effects can also be added. Possible Earth 5 billion years from now when the Sun goes red giant. Educational add-ons can also be implemented in different languages. These activities provide approximately 40 hours of space journeys and astronomical lessons to include extensive tours of the Celestia universe, the complete life cycle of stars, the solar system, the human space program, the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence (SETI), and depictions of astronomical events such as the formation of our moon billions of years ago, and the possible terraforming of Mars in the future.Installation instructions for the add-ons are available on the Wikibooks page In late 2017, a large addon pack project called Celestia Origin was created, which replaces all vanilla textures and graphics with higher-quality renderings. In 2019, Celestia forum member FarGetaNik created an addon pack called Project Echoes, featuring higher-quality renderings that replace all vanilla textures. Uses in media NASA and ESA have used Celestia in their educational and outreach programs, as well as for interfacing to trajectory analysis software. Celestia was used in the media by the CBS television show NCIS (Season 4, Episode 22: \\"In the Dark\\"). Character Timothy McGee explains what Celestia is and how an add-on can allow the user to store a diary within the program, as well. Textures designed by Celestia graphic artists were used in the movie The Day After Tomorrow and the 2008 miniseries The Andromeda Strain. Celestia has also appeared on the Science Channel's Through the Wormhole.

It was conceived in 1996 by Diego Marani (a journalist, author and translator for the European Council of Ministers in Brussels) based on the common practice of word-borrowing usage of many European languages. Marani used it in response to the perceived dominance of the English language; it is an emulation of the effect that non-native speakers struggling to learn a language typically add words and phrases from their native language to express their meanings clearly.. The main concept of Europanto is that there are no fixed rules‚Äîmerely a set of suggestions. This means that anybody can start to speak Europanto immediately; on the other hand, it is the speaker's responsibility to draw on an assumed common vocabulary and grammar to communicate. Marani wrote regular newspaper columns about the language and published a novel using it. As of 2005 he was no longer actively promoting it.  Origin of the name  The language's name \\"europanto\\" is a portmanteau of Europa (the word for Europe in some European languages) and the Greek root œÄŒ±ŒΩœÑœéœÇ- (\\"pantos-\\"; in English \\"all\\", \\"whole\\") and bears an intentional similarity with the name of the most widely spoken constructed international auxiliary language Esperanto.  Language code  The ISO 639-3 standard draft used to have the code \`eur\` for this constructed language, but it was retired on 16 January 2009, with the reason ‚ÄúNonexistent‚Äù.. For this reason, it is also not a valid language subtag for BCP 47 as it was not registered in the IANA Language Subtags Registry (waiting for a decision for the deletion request that was initiated in 2008, but also because ISO 639-3 was still a draft, as well as ISO 5646 which was still not published to allow importing standard ISO 639-3 codes in this registry on 29 July 2009).

For a short time, Brown became a noted abolitionist speaker in the northeast United States. As a public figure and fugitive slave, Brown felt extremely endangered by passage of the Fugitive Slave Law of 1850, which increased pressure to capture escaped slaves. He moved to England and lived there for 25 years, touring with an anti-slavery panorama, becoming a magician and showman. Brown married and started a family with an English woman, Jane Floyd. This was Brown's second wife; his first wife, Nancy, had been sold by her slaveowner. Brown returned to the United States with his English family in 1875, where he continued to earn a living as an entertainer. He toured and performed as a magician, speaker, and mesmerist until at least 1889. The last decade of his life (1886‚Äì97) was spent in Toronto, where he died in 1897. Childhood and slavery Henry Brown was born into slavery in 1816 on a plantation called Hermitage in Louisa County, Virginia. Henry may have remembered his parents fondly, stating that his mother was the one to instill Christian values into him. He is believed to have had at least two siblings, mentioning a brother and a sister in his autobiography.ERNEST, JOHN, editor. Narrative of the Life of Henry Box Brown, Written by Himself. University of North Carolina Press, 2008, www.jstor.org/stable/10.5149/9780807888858_ernest. At the age of 15, he was sent to work in a tobacco factory in Richmond. In his autobiography, Narrative of the Life of Henry Box Brown, Written by Himself, he describes his owner: \\"Our master was uncommonly kind, (for even a slaveholder may be kind) and as he moved about in his dignity he seemed like a god to us, but not with standing his kindness although he knew very well what superstitious notions we formed of him, he never made the least attempt to correct our erroneous impression, but rather seemed pleased with the reverential feelings which we entertained towards him.\\" The Resurrection of Henry Box Brown at Philadelphia, a lithograph by Samuel Rowse published in 1850'' Escape Brown was first married to a fellow slave, named Nancy, but their marriage was not recognized legally. They had three children born into slavery under the partus sequitur ventrem principle. Brown was hired out by his master in Richmond, Virginia, and worked in a tobacco factory, renting a house where he and his wife lived with their children. Brown had also been paying his wife's master not to sell his family, but the man betrayed Brown, selling pregnant Nancy and their three children to a different slave owner. With the help of James C. A. Smith, a free black man, and a sympathetic white shoemaker (and likely gambler) named Samuel A. Smith (no relation), Brown devised a plan to have himself shipped in a box to a free state by the Adams Express Company, known for its confidentiality and efficiency. Brown paid (out of his savings of $166) to Samuel Smith. Smith went to Philadelphia to consult with members of the Pennsylvania Anti-Slavery Society on how to accomplish the escape, meeting with minister James Miller McKim, William Still, and Cyrus Burleigh. He corresponded with them to work out the details after returning to Richmond. They advised him to mail the box to the office of Quaker merchant Passmore Williamson, who was active with the Vigilance Committee. To get out of work the day he was to escape, Brown burned his hand to the bone with sulfuric acid. The box in which Brown was shipped was and displayed the words \\"dry goods\\" on it. It was lined with baize, a coarse woolen cloth, and he carried only a small portion of water and a few biscuits. There was a single hole cut for air, and it was nailed and tied with straps. Brown later wrote that his uncertain method of travel was worth the risk: \\"if you have never been deprived of your liberty, as I was, you cannot realize the power of that hope of freedom, which was to me indeed, an anchor to the soul both sure and steadfast.\\" During the trip, which began on March 29, 1849, Brown's box was transported by wagon, railroad, steamboat, wagon again, railroad, ferry, railroad, and finally delivery wagon, being completed in 27 hours. Despite the instructions on the box of \\"handle with care\\" and \\"this side up,\\" several times carriers placed the box upside-down or handled it roughly. Brown remained still and avoided detection. Another \\"Resurrection of Henry Box Brown\\" published with an account of the story in William Still's 1872 book The Underground Railroad The box was received by Williamson, McKim, William Still, and other members of the Philadelphia Vigilance Committee on March 30, 1849, attesting to the improvements in express delivery services. When Brown was released, one of the men remembered his first words as \\"How do you do, gentlemen?\\" He sang a psalm from the Bible, which he had earlier chosen to celebrate his release into freedom. In addition to celebrating Brown's inventiveness, as noted by Hollis Robbins, \\"the role of government and private express mail delivery is central to the story and the contemporary record suggests that Brown's audience celebrated his delivery as a modern postal miracle.\\" The government postal service had dramatically increased communication and, despite southern efforts to control abolitionist literature, mailed pamphlets, letters and other materials reached the South. > Cheap postage, Frederick Douglass observed in The North Star, had an > \\"immense moral bearing\\". As long as federal and state governments respected > the privacy of the mails, everyone and anyone could mail letters and > packages; almost anything could be inside. In short, the power of prepaid > postage delighted the increasingly middle-class and commercial-minded North > and increasingly worried the slave-holding South. Brown's escape highlighted the power of the mail system, which used a variety of modes of transportation to connect the East Coast. The Adams Express Company, a private mail service founded in 1840, marketed its confidentiality and efficiency. It was favored by abolitionist organizations and \\"promised never to look inside the boxes it carried.\\" Life in freedom Brown became a well-known speaker for the Anti-Slavery Society and got to know Frederick Douglass. He was nicknamed \\"Box\\" at a Boston antislavery convention in May 1849, and thereafter used the name Henry Box Brown. He published two versions of his autobiography, Narrative of the Life of Henry Box Brown; the first, written with the help of Charles Stearns and conforming to expectations of the slave narrative genre, was published in Boston in 1849. The second was published in Manchester, England, in 1851, after he had moved there. While on the lecture circuit in the northeastern United States, Brown developed a moving panorama with his partner James C. A. Smith. They separated in 1851. Douglass wished that Brown had not revealed the details of his escape, so that others might have used it. When Samuel Smith attempted to free other slaves in Richmond in 1849, they were arrested. The year of his escape, Brown was contacted by his wife's new owner, who offered to sell his family to him, but the newly free man declined. This was an embarrassment within the abolitionist community, which tried to keep the information private. Brown is known for speaking out against slavery and expressing his feelings about the state of America. In his Narrative, he offers a cure for slavery, suggesting that slaves should be given the vote, a new president should be elected, and the North should speak out against the \\"spoiled child\\" of the South. After passage of the Fugitive Slave Law of 1850, which required cooperation from law enforcement officials to capture refugee slaves even in free states, Brown moved to England for safety, as he had become a known public figure. He toured Britain with his antislavery panorama for the next ten years, performing several hundred times a year. To earn a living, Brown also entered the British show circuit for 25 years, until 1875, after leaving the abolitionist circuit following the start of the American Civil War. In 1857, as Cutter documented in her book, The Illustrated Slave (2017), Brown acted in several plays written expressly for him by a British playwright ‚Äì E.G. Burton ‚Äì but his acting career appears to have been short-lived.In the 1860s, he began performing as a magician with acts as a mesmerist and conjuror, under the show names of \\"Prof. H. Box Brown\\" and the \\"African Prince\\". While in England, Brown married Jane Floyd, a white Cornish tin worker's daughter, in 1855 and began a new family. In 1875, he returned with his family to the U.S. with a group magic act. A later report documented the Brown Family Jubilee Singers. Death As the scholar Martha J. Cutter first documented in 2015, Henry Box Brown died in Toronto on June 15, 1897. Tax records and other documents indicate that he continued to perform into the early 1890s, but no performance records have been found. The last known performance by Brown is a newspaper account of a performance with his daughter Annie and wife Jane in Brantford, Ontario, Canada, dated February 26, 1889.Spencer, Suzette. \\"Henry Box Brown (1815 or 1816 ‚Äì after February 26, 1889)\\".

He is currently working with Air India Ltd. as Deputy General Manager (DGM). He also looks after the Air India Sports Promotion Board as a Joint Secretary based in Mumbai. Since the last 5 years, Dhanraj is overseeing the SAG Hockey Academy in Gujarat funded by the Gujarat Government. A legend of game, he is regarded as one of the best Indian players. Pillay born to a Tamil family made his debut in 1989 with the national team and in a career spanning over 15 years, appeared for India in four Olympic Games, World Cups and Champion Trophies each. He made 339 appearances for the national team and is recorded, unofficially, to have scored 170 goals. He also played for clubs in countries such as Malaysia, France, England and Germany. Recognizing his achievements, he was awarded the Padma Shri by the government of India in 2000. International career Dhanraj Pillay, whose career spanned from December 1989 to August 2004, played 339 international matches. The Indian Hockey Federation did not keep official statistics for the goals scored. There is no credible information on the number of International goals scored by Dhanraj. He scored around 170 goals in his career, according to both him and leading statisticians in the world. He is the only player to have played in four Olympics (1992, 1996, 2000, and 2004), four World Cups (1990, 1994, 1998, and 2002), four Champions Trophies (1995, 1996, 2002, and 2003), and four Asian Games (1990, 1994, 1998, and 2002). India won the Asian Games (1998) and Asia Cup (2003) under his captaincy. He was also the highest goal scorer in the Bangkok Asian Games and was the only Indian player to figure in the World Eleven side during the 1994 World Cup at Sydney. Club Hockey He has also played for foreign clubs like the Indian Gymkhana (London), HC Lyon (France), BSN HC & Telekom Malaysia HC (Malaysia), Abahani Limited, HTC Stuttgart Kickers (Germany) and Khalsa Sports Club (Hong Kong). Towards the end of his career, Dhanraj played in the Premier Hockey League for the Maratha Warriors for two seasons. Dhanraj Pillay turned up for the Karnataka Lions in the World Series Hockey being played in India. He scored two goals for his team, captained by ex-India captain Arjun Halappa. He also played for Indian Airlines in Beighton Cup.http://www.rediff.com/sports/2007/apr/10hock.htm He is currently the coach of the same team. Awards He is the recipient of India's highest sporting honour, the Rajiv Gandhi Khel Ratna award for the year 1999‚Äì2000. He was awarded the Padma Shri, a civilian award in 2001. He was the captain of the 1998 Asian Games and 2003 Asia Cup winning hockey team. He was awarded the player of the tournament award in the 2002 Champions trophy held at Cologne, Germany. In 2017 East Bengal club conferred Pillay with Bharat Gaurav. Pillay is currently involved in trying to start a hockey academy at Mumbai. To raise funds for his academy he is heading a drive to collect empty plastic printer cartridges in Mumbai and sell them to a European recycling firm. Politics He joined Aam Aadmi Party in February 2014 and started his political career. Controversies Dhanraj is often described as mercurial and has had his share of controversies. Time and again, he has vented this ire against the Hockey Management. He was not selected for the Indian team after the triumph at the Bangkok Asiad. The official reason given was that Dhanraj and 6 other senior players were rested. But it was largely seen as a retaliation for his outburst against the management for improper reception and non-payment of match fees. He protested against the low team stipend on overseas tours before the 1998 series against Pakistan. On receipt of the Khel Ratna, Pillay commented, \\"The award will help erase some bitter memories\\". His plans to start a hockey academy at Mumbai have not taken off fully as Mumbai Hockey Association has refused to allow its astroturf facility to be used for training.

Heydar Aliyev. > Azerbaijani politician who, was one of the most powerful men in Azerbaijan > for more than 30 years, as deputy chairman (1964-67) and chairman (1967-69) > of the regional KGB, as secretary (1969-87) of the Communist Party of > Azerbaijan, and from 1993 as the repressive and autocratic president of > independent Azerbaijan. Political commentators highlight that Aliyev ran a heavy-handed police state, that he rigged elections and muzzled the media \\"There is stability, because Mr Aliev is an acute tactician who runs a heavy-handed police state. Opposition leaders who decline to be co-opted are in jail, in exile or bullied. Elections are rigged, the media muzzled.\\" whereas others emphasize that his balanced policy brought stability to Azerbaijan.  Career in the Soviet era  = Early life = According to his website, he was born in Nakhchivan City. After graduating from Nakhchivan Pedagogical School, from 1939 to 1941 Aliyev attended the Azerbaijan Industrial Institute (now the Azerbaijan State Oil Academy), where he studied architecture. In 1949 and 1950, he studied at the USSR Ministry of State Security Higher School in Leningrad. Aliyev's official biography also stated that he studied at Baku State University, graduating with a degree in history in 1957. According to American journalist Pete Earley, Aliyev first attended the Ministry of State Security Academy in Leningrad, graduating in 1944. He also attended senior staff professional development courses at the Dzerzhinsky Higher School of the KGB in Moscow in 1966. In 1948, he married Zarifa Aliyeva. On 12 October 1955, their daughter Sevil was born. On 24 December 1961, their son Ilham was born. Zarifa Aliyeva died of cancer in 1985. = Early career = Heydar Aliyev served at the Archive Department of the People's Commissariat of Internal Affairs of the Nakhchivan Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic from 1941 to 1944, before his appointment to the head of General Department of the Council of People's Commissars of the Nakhchivan ASSR. H. Aliyev joined the Azerbaijan SSR People's Commissariat for State Security (NKGB) in 1944. He proceeded to become the department head of State Security Committee of Azerbaijan SSR in 1950, after he graduated from Senior Staff Training School of the USSR State Security Committee. In 1954, as part of a government reform, NKGB became known as Committee for State Security, or the KGB. Aliyev rose quickly through the KGB ranks, becoming a deputy chairman of the Azerbaijani KGB in 1964, its chairman in 1967, and eventually reaching the rank of major general.Nikolaij Nor-Mesek, Wolfgang Rieper.

An Ethnohistorical Dictionary of the Russian and Soviet Empires, Greenwood Press, 1994, , p. 71 In the early 1980s, Aliyev barred the offspring of certain legal personnel from attending the Republic's law school, in a purported effort to curb a self-perpetuating elite based on corruption.

Aliyev thus attained the highest position ever reached by an Azerbaijani in the Soviet Union.Roger East, Richard Thomas, Alan John Day. A Political and Economic Dictionary of Eastern Europe, Routledge, 2002, , p. 34 Aliyev was forced to resign from this position in 1987 amidst allegations of corruption made against him by Mikhail Gorbachev. Despite that, CIA report states that, Heydar Aliyev became First Deputy Chairman of USSR Council of Ministers and a full Politburo Member who publicly pledged to fight against corruption, free key state personnel and the economy of the Soviet Union from bribery. It is noted in the report that his colleagues understood his intention to deal harshly with corruption was serious and his commitment to the anti-corruption became his trademark within the Soviet Union.  From KGB to leader of Azerbaijan SSR  Aliyev in his KGB uniform. As head of the KGB's branch in Azerbaijan, Aliyev ran an anti-corruption campaign. Following the campaign, he became the undisputed leader of Azerbaijan. Aliyev became a candidate (non-voting) member of the Soviet Politburo in 1976. He ran this position until December 1982, when Yuri Andropov promoted him to the office of First Deputy Chairman of the Council of Ministers. Heydar Aliyev also served at the USSR Council of Ministers as the first deputy chairman in 1974-1979. His star waned following his appointment in 1985 under Mikhail Gorbachev. His political views became something of a liability to him in the era of perestroika, but he still exerted tremendous power in Azerbaijan.EurasiaNet Eurasia Insight - Azerbaijan: Biography Of Deceased Former President Heidar AliyevThe Gorbachev Prospect, by George Soros, Volume 36, Number 9, 1 June 1989,The New York Review of Books  Fall and re-invention  After his forced retirement in 1987, Aliyev remained in Moscow until 1990. He suffered a heart attack during this time. Aliyev opposed the January 1990 Soviet military crackdown in Baku, which had followed conflict regarding Nagorno-Karabakh since 1988 between Azerbaijan SSR and Armenia.Roger East, Richard J. Thomas. Profiles of People in Power: The World's Government Leaders, Routledge, 2003, , p. 32 Almost immediately after this public appearance in Moscow, Aliyev left Moscow for his native Nakhchivan. Here, Aliyev reinvented himself as a moderate nationalist. He was elected to the Supreme Soviet of Azerbaijan SSR in Baku in October 1990. Under the pressure and criticism from the groups connected to his nemesis, the then-leader of Soviet Azerbaijan Ayaz Mutallibov, Aliyev again returned to Nakhchivan, where he was elected Chairman of the Supreme Soviet of Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic in 1991. He resigned that same year from the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. By December 1991, when the Soviet Union ceased to exist and Azerbaijan formally became an independent state, despite Mutallibov's presidency Aliyev independently governed Nakhchivan. Early 1992 was marked by increased violence in Nagorno-Karabakh War with the fall of Shusha, the last Azerbaijani-populated town in Nagorno-Karabakh. These events resulted in the resignation of Mutallibov and the subsequent rise to power of the Azerbaijan Popular Front led by Abulfaz Elchibey. During Elchibey's one year in power, Aliyev continued to govern Nakhchivan without any subordination to the official government in Baku. The attempt by the Popular Front's Minister of Interior Isgandar Hamidov to forcibly overthrow Aliyev in Nakhchivan was thwarted by local militia at the regional airport. During the same period, Aliyev independently negotiated a cease-fire agreement in Nakhchivan with the then-President of Armenia, Levon Ter-Petrossian. Heydar Aliyev was elected as the leader of New Azerbaijan Party at its constituent congress organized in Nakhchivan on November 21, 1992. In May‚ÄìJune 1993, when, as a result of a crisis in the government, the country was on the verge of a civil war and faced the peril of losing independence, the people of Azerbaijan demanded to bring Heydar Aliyev to power, and the then leaders of Azerbaijan were obliged to officially invite Heydar Aliyev to Baku. On 24 June 1993, amidst the advancement of insurgent forces under Surat Huseynov's control towards Baku, Elchibey fled from the city to his native village of Keleki in Nakhchivan. Earlier, on 15 June 1993, Aliyev had been elected Chairman of the National Assembly of Azerbaijan, and after Elchibey's flight he also assumed temporary presidential powers.United States Library of Congress Country Studies Azerbaijan - The Coup of June 1993. In August 1993, Elchibey was stripped of his presidency by the nationwide referendum, and in October 1993, Aliyev was elected President of Azerbaijan. In May 1994, Aliyev entered into a ceasefire agreement that still remains in force to this very day. However, the conflict remained unresolved, with Armenian control over Nagorno-Karabakh.  Presidency  Aliyev during his Inauguration. On 3 October 1993, as a result of nationwide voting, Heydar Aliyev was elected President of the Republic of Azerbaijan. On 11 October 1998, having garnered at the elections, passed in high activeness of the population, 77 per cent of the votes, he was re-elected President of the Republic of Azerbaijan. Heydar Aliyev, giving his consent to be nominated as a candidate at the 15 October 2003 presidential elections, relinquished to run at the elections in connection with health problems. = Inaugurations = On 10 October 1993, Heydar Aliyev took an oath as the third President of the Republic of Azerbaijan in a ceremony held in the Republic Palace. During the ceremony he stated: The inauguration of President Aliyev for the second term occurred on 18 October 1998 at the Republic Palace. His inauguration coincided with the celebration of the Independence Day on 18 October. After taking the oath, Heydar Aliyev delivered his speech and declared being loyal to his oath one more time: = Domestic policy = The Government under Aliyev's leadership carried out legal, political and economical measures between 1993 and 2003. Further, Commission for Legal Reforms was established, in 1998 capital punishment was abolished. The institute of the Human Rights Ombudsman was established, amnesty and pardon mechanisms were introduced. Simultaneously, the comprehensive economic reforms including the agrarian reform were carried out; the state property privatization was initiated; the industrial and agricultural crises were lifted.  Constitutional reform  Constitutional Commission was assembled by Heydar Aliyev in June 1995 in order to substitute 1978 Azerbaijan SSR Constitution. The first draft was ready in October for public debate and the final version composed of 5 chapters, 12 sections and 147 articles, was confirmed according to results of popular referendum held on November 12, 1995. As a result, separation of power was provided among 3 divisions: legislative (Milli Majlis), executive (President) and judicial (courts). President Heydar Aliyev suggested amendments to the Constitution of Azerbaijan in June 2002. First amendment to the Constitution of Azerbaijan was approved as the result of referendum took place in August 2002. Consequently, 39 amendments to 23 articles of the Constitution of Azerbaijan were made, proportional party list elections to Parliament was abolished; transferring presidential power to Prime Minister instead of Chairman of Milli Majlis in case of resignation of President was confirmed; simple majority was preferred in the procedure of calculating the results of presidential elections; citizens, courts and Ombudsman of Azerbaijan received right to appeal directly to the Constitutional Court of Azerbaijan.  Abolition of Death Penalty  Heydar Aliyev requested the elimination of the death penalty on 3 February 1998. On his speech addressed to Milli Majlis, Aliyev stated: \\"I am convinced that the abolition of the death penalty is a crucial step in the humanization of criminal justice policy, moreover it is an important stage in the reform of the legal system as a whole\\". ‚ÄúTaking into consideration all the facts, I am submitting a draft law on amendments and additions to the Criminal, Criminal-Procedure and Corrective Labour Code of the Republic of Azerbaijan regarding the abolition of the capital punishment in the Republic of Azerbaijan in accordance with Article 96 of the Constitution of the Republic of Azerbaijan for the discussion.‚Äù Milli Majlis approved the draft law, so on 10 February 1998 the ‚ÄúLaw on Amendments and Additions to the Criminal, Criminal-Procedural and Corrective Labour Code of the Republic of Azerbaijan regarding the elimination of the death penalty in the Republic of Azerbaijan‚Äù was adopted. As a result, capital punishment was replaced with life imprisonment. Azerbaijan joined ‚ÄúSecond Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, aiming at the abolition of the death penalty‚Äù on 22 January 1999.  Establishment of Ombudsman Institution  Heydar Aliyev issued a decree on ‚ÄúMeasures for Ensuring Human and Civil Rights and Freedoms‚Äù on February 22, 1998.

Elmira S√ºleymanova was appointed as the Commissioner for Human Rights (Ombudsman) among 3 nominees requested by later President Heydar Aliyev according to the Decision No. 362 of the Milli Majlis on July 2, 2002.  Agrarian and land reform  Agrarian reforms implemented during the presidency of Heydar Aliyev can be divided into 2 phases: * 1995-1997 - At the first stage the legislative base for agrarian sector was reestablished with adopting a number of legislative documents. Privatization of agriculture of Azerbaijan with dissolving the traditional collective and state farms was in the center of these laws, as the Law on ‚Äúthe Basis of Agrarian Reform‚Äù (18 February 1995); ‚ÄúReform of state and collective farms‚Äù (18 February 1995);‚ÄúLand Reform‚Äù (16 July 1996). On 10 January 1997 Heydar Aliyev issued a Decree on ‚ÄúApproval of some legal documents assuring implementation of agrarian reforms‚Äù. State Commission on Agrarian Reforms was formed by the Decree of Heydar Aliyev dated 2 March 1995. * 1998-2001 - At the second phase the main attention was paid to post-privatization support and removing bureaucratic barriers to implement these reforms more effectively. Ministry of Agriculture was reorganized by presidential decree dated 6 June 1998 (On Ratification of the Statue on the Ministry of Agriculture), the law on ‚ÄúState land cadaster, land monitoring and structure‚Äù (22 December 1998), decree on ‚ÄúLand rent‚Äù (12 March 1999), law on ‚Äúland market‚Äù (7 May 1999) was adopted, moreover The Land Code of Azerbaijani Republic was approved by the Law on ‚ÄúApproval of Land Code of the Republic of Azerbaijan‚Äù dated 25 June 1999. = Foreign policy = A meeting between Heydar Aliyev with Vladimir Putin in Kremlin on 25 January 2002. During the presidency of Heydar Aliyev, foreign policy of Azerbaijan was rebuilt and transformed into balanced policy. The bilateral relations between Azerbaijan and other countries, as well as cooperation with international organizations, started to deepen. * Relations with United Nations. Azerbaijan began actively participating within the international organizations such as United Nations. Heydar Aliyev attended 49th session of UN General Assembly in 1994, in the special session of UN GA dedicated to 50th anniversary of United Nations in October 1995. He received former Secretary General of UN Boutros Boutros-Ghali in October 1994 in Baku. H.Aliyev met with Kofi Annan during his trip to USA in 1997 July. Heydar Aliyev addressed the Millennium Summit of UN held in September 2000 where he mentioned about Armenian invasion of Nagorno-Karabakh and adjacent regions, UN resolutions (822, 853, 874, 884) demanding unconditional withdrawal of the Armenian armed forces from the occupied Azerbaijani territories. After 11 September attacks, Azerbaijan joined anti-terror coalition of UN and cooperated with Office of Counter-Terrorism and Sanctions Committee of the UN SC. In October 2001, Azerbaijan joined International Convention for the Suppression of the Financing of Terrorism adopted by UN SC in 1999. * Relations with NATO. Partnership for Peace (PfP) Framework Document was signed to enhance security and defense cooperation with NATO on May 4, 1994. Aliyev approved PfP Presentation Document on April 19, 1996.

Heydar Aliyev gave importance to establish warmer relations with Russia than the previous leadership of Azerbaijan did. He stated in his speech at Milli Majlis on June 15, 1993 after being elected as the head of Parliament of Azerbaijan: \\"Russia, our northern neighbor, is absolutely a vast state. Undoubtedly, the relation based on independent principles between Azerbaijan and Russia must be better, broader and more fruitful\\". The Agreement on Friendship, Cooperation and Mutual Security between Russia and Azerbaijan was signed on July 3, 1997. Heydar Aliyev paid his first official trip to Russia as a President of the Republic of Azerbaijan in July 1997 with the invitation of the President of Russia Boris Yeltsin. The relations with Russia developed further through Aliyev-Putin negotiations during their bilateral visits (Vladimir Putin visited Azerbaijan in 2001 and Heydar Aliyev paid a reciprocal visit to Russia in 2002). The Agreements on ‚ÄúThe Status and Benefiting Principles of Gabala Radio Location Station‚Äù, ‚ÄúLong term economic cooperation agreement between Russian Federation and Azerbaijan Republic until the year 2010‚Äù, as well as ‚ÄúThe common declaration of the President of the Russian Federation, Vladimir Putin and President of the Republic of Azerbaijan, Heydar Aliyev‚Äù were signed in the latter meeting. * Relations with US. Establishing closer relations and developing cooperation with USA was among the main directions of the foreign policy of the former President of Azerbaijan Heydar Aliyev. He stated in one of his speeches regarding this issue: ‚ÄúThe relations of Azerbaijan with the United States are important as we need to learn the Western democracy, culture, achievements, to benefit from them, to use and apply them in Azerbaijan. In this regard, the United States is a special country for us\\". The relations between these two countries began to strengthen after oil contracts were signed between them as a result of Heydar Aliyev's oil strategy. Heydar Aliyev paid his first official visit to USA and met with President Bill Clinton on August 1, 1997. They signed Joint Statement on future relations between USA and Azerbaijan in defense and military issues. During this trip (27 July-5 August 1997), the statement on intentions of formation of bilateral dialogue between the US and Azerbaijan regarding the energy issues, the general agreement between the Government of the Azerbaijani Republic, the National Bank and the U.S. Export- Import Bank on the promotion of projects were signed. Additionally, 4 agreements on development and production sharing for the Azerbaijani sector of the Caspian Sea were signed. Heydar Aliyev issued an order on ‚ÄúMeasures to expand partnership relations between the Republic of Azerbaijan and the United States‚Äù on 2 September 1997 after the visit. Azerbaijan joined US-lead international coalition against terrorism after 11 September attacks, and sent a military contingent to Afghanistan. An amendment to the Freedom Support Act was adopted in 2002 (24 October) by the US Senate to allow the president of US to temporarily waive Section 907 which used to forbid to export any financial or humanitarian support to Azerbaijan.https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/PLAW-107publ115/html/PLAW-107publ115.htm = Oil strategy = Oil pipeline routes Heydar Aliyev used the oil potential of Azerbaijan to avoid the difficulties his country faced after the collapse of the Soviet Union by attracting foreign investment into Azerbaijan. After a series of negotiations took place in Baku, Istanbul and Houston over a year,‚ÄúAgreement on the Joint Development and Production Sharing for the Azeri and Chirag Fields and the Deep Water Portion of the Gunashli Field in the Azerbaijan Sector of the Caspian Sea‚Äù was signed in Baku on September 20, 1994, by the Government of Azerbaijan and the consortium of 11 oil companies from 6 countries (USA, UK, Russia, Norway, Turkey, Saudi Arabia) in the presence of Heydar Aliyev. State Oil Fund of Azerbaijan was established by the Presidential Decree of Heydar Aliyev in December 1999 to gather the income gained from oil profit with the aim of financing social and economic projects. As a result of oil strategy developed by Heydar Aliyev, Azerbaijani oil was planned to be carried through different routes as Baku-Supsa, BTC, etc. In order to export Azerbaijani oil to the European market, the presidents of Azerbaijan, Georgia and Turkey agreed on constructing Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan pipeline in 1998 in Ankara. The ground-breaking ceremony of BTC took place in September 2002 with the participation of Heydar Aliyev, Ahmet Necdet Sezer and Edward Shevardnadze. To export Azerbaijani crude oil to the Novorossiysk port of Russia was decided by the contract signed in Moscow on February 18, 1996, transportation of oil through this route was realized in October 1997. Establishment of the alternative Baku-Supsa route was agreed on March 8, 1996, by Heydar Aliyev and Edward Shevardnadze. This route started to operate in April 1999.  Death and successor  The Heydar Aliyev International Airport in Baku Aliyev's health began to fail in 1999, when he had a major heart bypass operation in the United States at the Cleveland Clinic. He later had prostate surgery and a hernia operation. He suffered a collapse while giving a speech on live television in April 2003. On 6 August Aliyev returned to the United States for treatment of congestive heart failure and kidney problems. He stood down from the presidency at the start of October 2003 and appointed his son Ilham as his party's sole presidential candidate.

Gold and his brother Floyd, writing as \\"Christopher Grimm\\", took the cover of the October 1959 issue of Galaxy with their novella \\"Someone To Watch Over Me\\" Horace Leonard \\"H. L.\\" Gold (April 26, 1914 ‚Äì February 21, 1996) was an American science fiction writer and editor. Born in Canada, Gold moved to the United States at the age of two. He was most noted for bringing an innovative and fresh approach to science fiction while he was the editor of Galaxy Science Fiction, and also wrote briefly for DC Comics. Life and family H. L. Gold was Jewish, and there are claims that he at first had to write under pseudonyms because publishers feared the readers' potential antisemitism. He was drafted in to the US Army during the Second World War, serving in the Pacific theater of Operations. His marriage to Evelyn Stein ended in divorce in 1957, and his second marriage was to Muriel \\"Nicky\\" (Nicholson) Conley. He died in 1996. His brother Floyd C. Gold, writing under the pen name Floyd C. Gale, was the primary book reviewer for Galaxy from 1955-1963. His son E. J. Gold is an artist, writer, musician and one of the oldest online gamers. Author and editor =Science Fiction= After becoming editor of Galaxy Gold wrote that as a \\"dazzled boy\\" he \\"discovered science fiction in 1927, at the age of 13\\": During the 1930s, Gold unsuccessfully wrote stories for pulp magazines. The day he was fired from his regular job because his boss believed that a writer should not work as a busboy, Gold learned that he had made his first sale. Beginning with \\"Inflexure\\" (as Clyde Crane Campbell) in Astounding Science Fiction (October 1934), Gold later worked for Standard Magazines, Fawcett Comics and Timely Comics.Biography by Joe Desris, in Batman Archives, Volume 3 (DC Comics, 1994), p. 223 He used the Campbell pen-name for his first half-dozen or so stories in 1934/35. When he resumed his writing career in 1938 he took the billing Horace L. Gold, but soon shortened it to the now more familiar H. L. Gold. Gold's most noted stories tended more toward fantasy, like his \\"Trouble with Water\\" (1939). In 1939-41 he was an assistant editor on a trio of science fiction magazines -- Captain Future, Thrilling Wonder Stories and Startling Stories. His 1939 novel, None But Lucifer in Unknown (September 1939) was a collaboration with L. Sprague de Camp. =Comics and World War II= During the early 1940s, Gold teamed with Kendell Foster Crossen on comic book scripts, freelancing with DC Comics writing for Batman, Superman, Superboy, Boy Commandos and Wonder Woman from \\"roughly the end of 1942\\" until World War II interrupted his career. He was drafted in 1944, although he was Canadian, flatfooted, overage and had a newborn child. He returned on compassionate leave (possibly in May 1946) to be at his dying father Henry's bedside in Fall River, Massachusetts. He had been offered directorship of Armed Forces Radio postwar, which he declined. After serving, he returned to New York City, where he scripted for comic books and radio programs. Gold's story \\"The Old Die Rich\\" (Galaxy Science Fiction, March 1953), written at the same time as Marcia Davenport's My Brother's Keeper, may have been inspired by the New York Times articles about the Collyer brothers as was Davenport's novel. Gold often found story ideas in newspaper clippings. Galaxy and Beyond Gold as depicted in Amazing Stories in 1953. H. L. Gold is perhaps best known as a leading magazine editor during the American post-World War II science fiction boom. In 1949 he began in that direction, and launched Galaxy Science Fiction in 1950, which was soon followed by its companion fantasy magazine, Beyond Fantasy Fiction (1953‚Äì55). Gold's Galaxy \\"made a startling impact on the world of science fiction\\", successor Frederik Pohl said in 1965, with \\"wit and relevance\\"; \\"It is difficult to exaggerate that impact\\". Some writers saw Gold as \\"a sort of slave-driver\\" but, Pohl said, \\"as one of the most frequently flogged of the slaves ... the results were worth it\\". With Galaxy Gold created a different kind of science fiction magazine by focusing less on technology, hardware and pulp adventures. Instead, he introduced themes leaning toward sociology, psychology and satire. He paid more than was common at the time and had the advantage that several talented authors had become alienated from John W. Campbell due to his enthusiasm for Dianetics. Gold also edited several anthologies (1952‚Äì62) related to the magazine. He suffered from increasing agoraphobia (originating from war trauma), and retired from Galaxy in 1961 due to his health problems. Gold lived the rest of his life in seclusion, though he published occasional short stories and guest editorials through the early 1980s. Collected stories His collection The Old Die Rich (Crown, 1955) includes \\"And Three to Get Ready\\", \\"At the Post\\", \\"The Biography Project\\" (as Dudley Dell), \\"Don't Take It to Heart\\", \\"Hero\\", \\"Love in the Dark\\" (also known as \\"Love Ethereal\\"), \\"Man of Parts\\", \\"The Man with English\\", \\"No Charge for Alterations\\", \\"The Old Die Rich\\", \\"Problem in Murder\\" and \\"Trouble with Water\\". While Anthony Boucher praised Gold as \\"almost the only s.f. writer capable of creating lower and lower-middle class background,\\" he found that the stories \\"are simply not up to the standards of craftsmanship\\" that Gold set as an editor.\\"Recommended Reading,\\" F&SF;, August 1955, p.94.

Early life Hupka was born in a British internment camp in Diyatalawa, Sri Lanka, to a Silesian German Catholic professor Erich Hupka and a Jewish-German Lutheran mother Sara Rosenthal. Herbert Hupka grew up in Ratibor, Upper Silesia (Free State of Prussia, Germany). In his younger years Hupka was raised in the Catholic religion and close to the democratic Catholic Zentrum party. After having served in the Wehrmacht at the Eastern Front, and after having completed his Habilitation, Hupka was expelled from the Wehrmacht in August 1944 for being a \\"half-Jew\\" because his mother was Jewish; she survived deportation to and internment in Theresienstadt concentration camp. Following World War II their Upper Silesian hometown became part of the People's Republic of Poland and Hupka and his mother were expelled to West Germany. Politics and Expellee Issues Hupka was a member of the Bundestag from 1969-1987 . He was also president of the Eastern German Culture Council () and Vice-President of the Federation of Expellees (Bund der Vertriebenen). The expellees' issues formed the kernel of his political activities. He was the chairman of the Landsmannschaft Schlesien from 1968 to 2000. He was also chairman of the Eastern German Culture Council and vice-chairman of the Federation of Expellees from historical eastern Germany. Hupka had opposed the Ostpolitik initiated by Willy Brandt and carried on by further SPD and even (later) CDU-led administrations. These policies subscribed to the acceptance of the territorial changes that took place after the Second World War; this line explicitly denied all attempts to regain these territories and former provinces, which had become parts of Poland or the Russian SFSR. Herbert Hupka, on the other hand, spoke in favour of incorporating the territories into a unified, future German state. His opinions, which were regarded as revanchist, made him unpopular not only with the left, as he opposed the recognition of the Oder-Nei√üe border with the People's Republic of Poland. On 29 February 1972, Hupka crossed the floor from the Bundestag faction of the SPD to the CDU/CSU faction. Nevertheless, in 1985 CDU-leader and federal chancellor Helmut Kohl also refused to speak at the Landsmannschaft Schlesien's annual conference unless its theme, \\"Schlesien bleibt unser\\" (\\"Silesia remains ours [i.e. German]\\") was changed to a less controversial theme. Hupka was one of the Landsmannschaft's members who refused to change the theme, thereby conflicting heavily with Kohl, leader of the CDU. In the end he agreed to change the name to \\"Silesia remains our future in a common Europe of free nations\\". Hupka, once the target of Polish and Soviet communist (and nationalist) propaganda, was later employed as an advisor by the local government of present-day Silesia and was awarded the title of an honorary citizen of Racib√≥rz, the historic town of his youth. Later in life, Hupka partially gave up his former views on totally restoring the pre-1945 borders of Germany and became a conditional supporter of the German-Polish rapproachement. Death Hupka died on 24 August 2006 at his home in Bonn, after an accident. The causes of the accident have not been fully investigated.

A somersault can be performed forwards, backwards, or sideways and can be executed in the air or on the ground. When performed on the ground it is typically called a roll. Somersault originates from an obsolete French word, sombresault, from Occitan sobresaut; and ultimately Latin ‚Äì supra, \\"over\\", and saltus, \\"jump\\".  Types  Front somersault in the pike position Back somersault on one foot There are many variations of front and back somersaults. Somersaults can be performed in multiples, or multiples of quarter body revolutions, in some cases with additional twist rotations or ending in body landings, producing variations such as: * Crash dive (¬æ front somersault to back landing) * Lazy back (¬æ back somersault to front landing) * Ballout (1¬º front somersault to feet from back landing) * Cody (1¬º back somersault to feet from front landing) * Barani (front somersault with twist) * Rudolph (or Rudi) (front somersault with 1¬Ω twists) * Randolph (or Randi) (front somersault with 2¬Ω twists) * Adolf (or Adi) (front somersault with 3¬Ω twists) * Full back or frontfull (back somersault or front somersault with 1 twist) less common with single backs * Double (double front or back somersault) * Triple (triple front or back somersault) * Arabian (half-in, front somersault) * Arabian Double (half-in, double front somersault) * Arabian Double half-out (half-in, double front somersault with ¬Ω twist in the second somersault) * Double full (back somersault with 2 twists) * Triple full (back somersault with 3 twists) * Quadruple full (back somersault with 4 twists) * Thomas (1¬Ω back somersault with 1¬Ω twists to front dive roll) * Thomas Full In (Thomas salto with an additional full twist) * Back half-out (double back somersault with ¬Ω twist in the second somersault) * Front half-out (double front somersault with ¬Ω twist in the second somersault) * Back in ‚Äì full out (double back somersault with 1 twist in the second somersault) * Front in ‚Äì full out (double front somersault with 1 twist in the first somersault) * Back Full In (double back somersault with ¬Ω twist in the first somersault) * Front Full In (double front somersault with a full twist in the first somersault) * Back Full In half-out (double back somersault with a full twist in the first somersault and an extra ¬Ω twist in the second somersault) * Front Full In half-out (double front somersault with a full twist in the first somersault and an extra ¬Ω twist in the second somersault) * Back Double Double (double back somersault with 1 twist in both somersaults) * Front Double Double (double front somersault with 1 twist in both somersaults) * Back Double Double half-out (double back somersault with 1 twist in both somersaults and an extra ¬Ω twist in the second somersault) * Front Double Double half-out (double front somersault with 1 twist in both somersaults and an extra ¬Ω twist in the second somersault) * Back Triple Double (double back somersault with 1¬Ω twists in both somersaults) * Front Triple Double (double front somersault with 1¬Ω twists in both somersaults) = Terminology = A pitch tuck somersault performed by acro dance partners The names and nomenclature used for somersaults varies among different sports and activities, as well as regionally. In competitive gymnastics and trampolining, standardized names have been assigned to all common variations, which may be performed in tucked, piked, or straight body orientations. Within British gymnastic associations, a crash dive is referred to as a ¬æ front somersault (straight). Similarly, a Barani Ballout is referred to as a Ballout Barani to indicate that the forward somersault is executed before the twist. The word flip is synonymous with an airborne somersault in a number of countries. In contrast, in Britain and some other countries, a flip must rely on the arms to induce body revolution, and the body need not be completely airborne (hands may contact the floor). The word somerset was also used in Victorian England to describe what today is called a somersault. For example, an 1843 poster advertising Pablo Fanque's Circus Royal boasts, \\"Mr. HENDERSON will undertake the arduous Task of THROWING TWENTY-ONE SOMERSETS, ON THE SOLID GROUND.\\" http://ringlingdocents.org/Mr.Kite.htm  See also  * Aerial cartwheel * Cartwheel (gymnastics) * Roll (gymnastics) * Trampolining * Tumbling * Parkour * Handspring * Diving * Tumble turn  References  Category:Gymnastics manoeuvres ","title":"Somersault"},{"id":"399801","text":"Sam Moskowitz (June 30, 1920 ‚Äì April 15, 1997) was an American writer, critic, and historian of science fiction.  Biography  As a child, Moskowitz greatly enjoyed reading science fiction pulp magazines. As a teenager, he organized a branch of the Science Fiction League. Meanwhile, Donald A. Wollheim helped organize the Futurians, a rival club with Marxist sympathies. While still in his teens, Moskowitz became chairman of the first World Science Fiction Convention held in New York City in 1939. He barred several Futurians from the convention because they threatened to disrupt it. This event is referred to by historians of fandom as the \\"Great Exclusion Act\\".Kyle, David. \\"The Great Exclusion Act of 1939,\\" Mimosa #6Kyle, David. \\"SaM -- Fan Forever,\\" Mimosa no. 21, pp. 7‚Äì10, Dec. 1997 Moskowitz later worked professionally in the science fiction field. He edited Science-Fiction Plus, a short-lived genre magazine owned by Hugo Gernsback, in 1953. He compiled about two dozen anthologies, and a few single-author collections, most published in the 1960s and early 1970s. Moskowitz also wrote a handful of short stories (three published in 1941, one in 1953, three in 1956). His most enduring work is likely to be his writing on the history of science fiction, in particular two collections of short author biographies, Explorers of the Infinite and Seekers of Tomorrow, as well as the highly regarded Under the Moons of Mars: A History and Anthology of \\"The Scientific Romance\\" in the Munsey Magazines, 1912‚Äì1920. His exhaustive cataloging of early sf magazine stories by important genre authors remains the best resource for nonspecialists. Theodore Sturgeon, although noting the book's many imperfections, praised Explorers of the Infinite, saying \\"no one has surveyed the roots of SF as well as Mr. M.; probably no one ever will; prossibly , no one else can.\\"\\"Galaxy's 5 Star Shelf\\", Galaxy Science Fiction, December 1963, p. 124. It is not evident whether \\"prossibly\\" is a typographical error or a portmanteau. Reviewing Seekers of Tomorrow, Algis Budrys wryly noted that \\"Moskowitz is a master of denotation. He wouldn't know a connotation if it snapped at his ankle, which is something that happens quite often.\\" He added, however, that \\"Moskowitz knows and transmits, at least as much about the history of science fiction and its evolution, as anyone possibly could.\\"\\"Galaxy Bookshelf\\", Galaxy Science Fiction, October 1966, pp. 159‚Äì60 Moskowitz's works include also The Immortal Storm, a historical review of internecine strife within fandom. Moskowitz wrote it in a bombastic style that made the events he described seem so important that, as fan historian Harry Warner Jr. quipped, \\"If read directly after a history of World War II, it does not seem like an anticlimax.\\" Floyd C. Gale wrote in his review of the book that \\"[f]ortunately, most of these petulant warriors have since grown up‚Äîbut their historian is still leading their ghostly legions that are more real than today to him. The miracle is that S-F survived even the love of its most rabid fans\\". Anthony Boucher noted that \\"never has so much been written about so little,\\" but added that the book was \\"a unique document not without a good deal of social and psychological value.\\"\\"Recommended Reading,\\" F&SF;, February 1955, p. 98. Moskowitz was also renowned as a science fiction book collector, with a tremendous number of important early works and rarities. His book collection was auctioned off after his death. As \\"Sam Martin\\", he was also editor of the trade publications Quick Frozen Foods and Quick Frozen Foods International for many years. First Fandom, an organization of science fiction fans active before 1940, gives an award in Moskowitz' memory each year at the World Science Fiction Convention. Moskowitz smoked cigarettes frequently throughout his adult life. A few years before his death, throat cancer required the surgical removal of his larynx. He continued to speak at science fiction conventions, using an electronic voice-box held against his throat. Throughout his later years, although his controversial opinions were often disputed by others, he was recognized as a leading authority on the history of science fiction.

These derogatory names first appeared in the presidential election of 1872. The terms have several meanings. One use is to insult politicians that the speaker believes are too moderate or centrist. This use is similar to saying that a Republican is \\"Republican In Name Only\\". Another use is to indicate that the two major parties are essentially interchangeable from the speaker's perspective, because neither major party supports the changes that the speaker wants to see. Equivalent terms in countries other than the United States An equivalent term used in the United Kingdom is Lib- Lab-Con or LibLabCon, a pejorative portmanteau referring to the three main political parties (the Liberal Democrats, the Labour Party, and the Conservative Party), suggesting that there are no real differences between the three and that the UK is effectively a single-party system. Usage Republicans have often portrayed themselves to be pro-business and, in recent times, have favored an aggressive foreign policy; Democrats have tended to campaign on more liberal social policies and a more important role for government-funded social programs. Merriam-Webster Dictionary defines it as \\"a member of the Democratic party esp. in the southern states who supports to a large extent the policy and measures of the Republican party.\\" Oxford Dictionaries defines the term as \\"A person whose political philosophy is a blend of policies and principles from both the Republican and Democratic parties.\\" The term is sometimes used in a pejorative sense by members of one party to attack members of their party who are either centrist or who have what they perceive to be the wrong ideology. The term Republicrat is commonly used by liberal Democrats to attack conservative and centrist members of the party, such as Senator Joe Lieberman. On the Republican side, George W. Bush, Mitt Romney, and Newt Gingrich are common examples of Republicrats due to their liberal stances on various political issues. Another term used by liberal Democrats to describe conservative and centrist members of their party is \\"Democrat In Name Only\\" or \\"DINO\\"; likewise, a conservative Republican term for liberal and centrist Republicans is \\"Republican In Name Only\\" or \\"RINO\\". Another usage of the term puts the words together in order to voice the not unheard-of opinion that the two mainstream American political parties are the same with different names. Often, this usage expresses the sentiment of ordinary citizens who see all politicians as serving the same special interests and make little distinction between the two parties. Earl Killian's U.S. political glossary defines the term as \\"a portmanteau of the words \\"Republican\\" and \\"Democrat\\"...used to symbolize the one-party nature of U.S. politics, when it comes to issues on which the dominant parties of the two- party system agree....In this view...Republicrats is then the name of the single U.S. political party, and the Republicans and Democrats are seen as factions of this one-party system, rather than as true independent parties.\\" Some commentators, such as right-wing radio talk-show host Michael Savage and left-wing activist Ralph Nader, who have both used the terms, have opined on how it is often hard to tell the parties apart, leading to the term's popularisation. This was a view shared on the left by the Green Party during the 2000 U.S. Presidential election, whose bumper stickers read, \\"Bush and Gore make me want to Ralph\\". Former Dead Kennedys vocalist and Green Party member Jello Biafra has used the term during interviews as well. In 2004, boxing promoter Don King told Larry King he was a Republicrat. He defined it as being for \\"whoever's going to be doing something or the upward mobility of America, black and white alike.\\" Usage in popular culture *In the 1982 TV special \\"Rap's Hawaii\\", comedian Rap Reiplinger portrayed Willy Maunawili an \\"independent republicrat candidate for representative\\". *In the 1994 movie \\"Reality Bites\\" actor Ethan Hawke performed the song \\"I'm Nuthin'\\", written by him.

Created by and starring comedian Sean Masterson, Republicrats followed Masterson as a former weather man who formed the \\"Republicrat\\" party and ran as the party's presidential candidate.

He won a Hugo Award and three World Fantasy Awards in the science fiction and fantasy genre, a World Fantasy Life Achievement award, and an Ellery Queen's Mystery Magazine short story award and an Edgar Award in the mystery genre. Davidson edited The Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction from 1962 to 1964. His last novel The Boss in the Wall: A Treatise on the House Devil was completed by Grania Davis and was a Nebula Award finalist in 1998. The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction says \\"he is perhaps sf's most explicitly literary author\\". Biography Davidson was born in 1923 in Yonkers, New York, to Jewish parents. He served as a Navy hospital corpsman (medic) with the Marine Corps in the Pacific during World War II, and began his writing career as a Talmudic scholar around 1950. As reported at the time in the February 20, 1962 Yonkers daily, the Herald Statesman, Rabbi Arnold Weinberger officiated at his wedding to Miss Grania Kalman, which took place at the home of Damon Knight. This made his conversion to Tenrikyo in the 1970s unexpected. Although he had a reputation for being quick to anger, Davidson was known among his friends for his generosity. His peripatetic life and career may have been due to a disinclination to finish what he began. His reputation among science fiction and fantasy readers peaked in the 1960s, after which he had a coterie of fans who (as with R. A. Lafferty), kept his reputation alive, especially after his death. He was a member of the Swordsmen and Sorcerers' Guild of America (SAGA), a loose-knit group of Heroic Fantasy authors founded in the 1960s, some of whose works were anthologized in Lin Carter's Flashing Swords! anthologies. While editing The Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction he lived in Mexico, and later in British Honduras (now renamed Belize). He lived in a rural district of Novato, in northern Marin County, California, in 1970, but later moved closer to San Francisco. He lived in a small house in Sausalito, at the southern end of Marin County next to San Francisco in 1971 and 1972, and it was there fans and friends were welcomed. He worked for a short time in the late 1970s as a creative writing instructor at the University of Texas at El Paso. In his later years, he lived in Washington state, including a brief stay in the Veterans' Home in Bremerton. He died in his tiny apartment in Bremerton on May 8, 1993, aged 70. A memorial service was held in Gasworks Park in Seattle. He was survived by his son Ethan and his ex-wife Grania Davis, who continued to edit and release his unpublished works until her own death. Fiction and articles Davidson wrote many stories for fiction magazines beginning in the 1950s, after publishing his first fiction in Commentary and other Jewish intellectual magazines. Davidson was active in science fiction fandom from his teens. His best-known works are his novels about Vergil Magus, the magician that medieval legend made out of the Roman poet Virgil; the Peregrine novels, a comic view of Europe shortly after the fall of Rome; the Jack Limekiller stories, about a Canadian living in an imaginary Central American country modelled after Belize during the 1960s; and the stories of Dr. Eszterhazy, a sort of even more erudite Sherlock Holmesian figure living in the mythical Scythia-Pannonia- Transbalkania, the waning fourth-largest empire in Europe. Lesser known and uncollected during his lifetime are his mystery stories, which were assembled after his death as The Investigations of Avram Davidson. These mystery stories frequently have a historical setting, and are intricately plotted. In addition, Davidson ghosted two Ellery Queen mysteries, And on the Eighth Day and The Fourth Side of the Triangle, and a true crime collection, Crimes and Chaos. Other noteworthy works are his collaborations. In Joyleg, A Folly, written in collaboration with Ward Moore, a veteran of the American Revolutionary War (and of the Whiskey Rebellion) is found alive and very well in the Tennessee backwoods, having survived over the centuries by daily soaks in whisky of his own making to hilariously face the world of the 1960s. In Marco Polo and the Sleeping Beauty, co-written with Grania Davis, the background of Marco Polo's travels in the Mongol Empire is borrowed for an original story. After Davidson's death, Grania Davis also finished The Boss in the Wall, a claustrophobic horror novel that bears little resemblance to the work of any other writer. Davidson also wrote dozens of short stories that defy classification, and the Adventures in Unhistory essays, which delve into puzzles such as the identity of Prester John and suggest solutions to them. His earlier historical essays were scrupulously researched, even when published by magazines just as happy to offer fiction as fact. Later essays were handicapped by a lack of resources in the libraries of the small towns where Davidson lived in the pre-Internet era, but are enlivened by the style and bold speculation. Davidson's work is marked by a strong interest in history, with his plots often turning on what at first might seem like minor events. His characterization is also unusually in-depth for fantasy, and is often enriched by his ear for unusual accents. Davidson's most obvious characteristics are his plotting and style. Very little may happen in a Davidson story, but he described it in detail. Hidden among the detail are facts or omissions that later become important to the outcome of the story. Especially in his later works, Davidson included elements that beginning writers are told to avoid, such as page-long sentences with half a dozen colons and semi-colons, or an apparently irrelevant digression in the opening pages of a story.

He was eventually freed in Iceland in July 2002, but died in December 2003 in Norway of pneumonia. History Keiko was captured near Rey√∞arfj√∂r√∞ur, Iceland in 1979 and sold to the Icelandic aquarium in Hafnarfj√∂r√∞ur. At the time, he was named Siggi, with the name Kago given at a later date. In 1982, the orca was sold to Marineland in Niagara Falls, Ontario, Canada. At this new facility, the whale first started performing for the public and developed skin lesions indicative of poor health and was also bullied by older orcas. Keiko was then sold to Reino Aventura, an amusement park in Mexico City, in 1985. There, he was given the name \\"Keiko\\", a feminine Japanese name that means \\"lucky one\\" or \\"blessed child\\". He was transported to Mexico via cargo plane from the Northwest Territories. At the time, the orca was only 10 feet long and was housed at the Mexican facility in a tank intended for smaller dolphins. He was found by film scouts at the run-down park and became the star of Free Willy in 1993. The publicity from his role in the popular film led to an effort by Warner Bros. Studio to find him a better home. (This was essential because the pool for the now 21-foot-long orca was only 22 feet deep, 65 feet wide and 114 feet long (), and the water temperature was often too warm.) Some of the content was filmed at Reino Aventura and the rest in Mexico City. Donations from Warner Brothers and Craig McCaw led to the establishment of the Free Willy-Keiko Foundation in February 1995. With donations from the foundation and millions of school children, the Oregon Coast Aquarium in Newport, Oregon, US was given over $7 million to construct facilities to return him to health with the hope of eventually returning him to the wild. Reino Aventura donated Keiko to the Foundation. UPS provided ground transportation to the nearby Newport Municipal Airport in a specialized container. Before he left the amusement park in Mexico, Keiko performed for the public for the last time. Weighing about 7,700 pounds (3493 kg), he was transported by air in a C-130 Hercules loaned by UPS; during the flight, the orca was in a 30 foot long transfer tank filled with sea water and cooled occasionally with ice cubes. On arrival in Oregon in 1996, Keiko was housed in a new () concrete enclosure containing seawater, his first experience with this medium. His weight had increased significantly by June 1997, to 9,620 pounds (4364 kg). The plan to return him to the wild was a topic of much controversy. Some felt his years of captivity made such a return impossible. Researchers in a scientific study later said attempts to return him to the wild were unsuccessful, but that monitoring him with radio and satellite tags was part of \\"a contingency plan for return to human care,\\" which secured \\"the long-term well-being of the animal.\\" Others considered his release misguided. The Norwegian pro-whaling politician Steinar Bastesen made international news for his statement that Keiko should instead be killed and the meat sent to Africa as foreign aid. Loading Keiko onto a C-17 transport on 9 September 1998, in Newport, Oregon for transport to the Westman Islands in Iceland Nevertheless, the process of preparing Keiko for the wild began on 9 September 1998, when he was flown to Klettsv√≠k, a bay on the island of Heimaey in Vestmannaeyjar, Iceland. Upon landing at Vestmannaeyjar Airport, the C-17 Globemaster aircraft suffered a landing gear failure causing over $1 million in damage, though Keiko was unharmed. His day-to-day care became the responsibility of the Free Willy-Keiko Foundation with management assistance from the Ocean Futures Society. He was initially housed in a pen in the Klettsvik Bay where he underwent training designed to prepare him for his eventual release, including supervised swims in the open ocean. Ocean Futures left the Keiko project in late 2001. The Free Willy-Keiko Foundation and The Humane Society of the United States re-established management of the project at that time until Keiko's death in 2003.Free Willy-Keiko Foundation Keiko was fully free by the summer of 2002 and departed Icelandic waters in early August following some killer whales but not integrated with the pod. (His journey was tracked via the signal from a VHF tag attached to the dorsal fin.) About a month later, he arrived in Norway's Sk√•lvik Fjord, apparently seeking contact with human beings and allowing children to ride on his back. His caretakers relocated to Norway and continued to conduct boat-follows with Keiko for the next 15 months. On the basis of girth measurements and blood tests, it was assumed that Keiko had fed during his 900-mile (1500 km) journey to Norway from Iceland. Keiko occasionally approached groups of wild killer whales, but remained on the periphery, at distances of 100‚Äì300 meters (109 to 328 yards), with his head pointing toward the closest orca. Death Keiko died in Taknes Bay, Sk√•lvikfjord, Norway, while swimming in the fjords on 12 December 2003, at about 27 years of age. Pneumonia was determined as his probable cause of death. Evaluation of the re-introduction process Most sources conclude that the project to free Keiko was a failure because the whale failed to adapt to life in the wild. In Norway, Keiko had little contact with other orcas and was not fishing; for months before his death, the whale was being fed daily. A report in The Guardian describes the freed orca's life in Taknes Bay as follows: \\"... until his death Keiko was, rather than frolicking freely in his fjord, being taken for 'walks' by caretakers in a small boat at least three times a week. ... It took more than 60 failed attempts to reunite Keiko with free orcas before he followed a group where, spotting a fishing vessel off the Norwegian coast, he followed it into the fjords that would prove his final resting place.\\" According to an article in New Scientist, \\"He was seen diving among the wild orcas only once, on 30 July 2002. And after physical contact at the surface, Keiko swam away, seeking out human company on the tracking boat\\". A scientific study published in the journal Marine Mammal Science (July 2009) confirms that he was seen on the periphery of some wild groups but was never seen to be socially integrated with such whales. In summary, \\"He never integrated into a wild pod ... and could not break his need for human contact.\\" His return to humans for food and for company confirms the failure of the project according to the same scientific study. Reasons cited for Keiko's failure to adapt include his early age at capture, the long history of captivity, prolonged lack of contact with conspecifics and strong bonds with humans.http://www.orcanetwork.org/nathist/simon2009keiko.pdf In spite of those comments, David Phillips, executive director of the Free Willy-Keiko Foundation, praised the release project: \\"We took the hardest candidate and took him from near death in Mexico to swimming with wild whales in Norway\\". \\"Keiko had five years with the sights and sounds of natural seawater. I think it was a great success in terms of Keiko, his well-being, and the whole world that wanted to do the right thing.\\" Others also claim that the release was a success, and The Huffington Post called it a \\"phenomenal success ... giving him years of health and freedom\\". The total cost of freeing Keiko was about US$20 million. The lead author of the study published by Marine Mammal Science said: \\"You can't just let these animals out into the wild. You have to take the responsibility, and that might cost a lot of money. The fortune spent on Keiko might have been better invested in conservation programs to protect whales and their habitat ... But that's not as appealing as the adventures of a single whale\\". An alternative to freeing orcas after long-term captivity, is the use of a \\"sanctuary\\" or \\"oceanic enclosure\\" (sea pen), according to Lori Marino of the Whale Sanctuary Project.http://www.whalesanctuaryproject.org/release/renowned-marine- conservationist-dr-carl-safina-joins-board-of-whale-sanctuary-project/ \\"They can‚Äôt be released, but their quality of life can be improved by orders of magnitude\\", Marino said in a 2016 interview where she agreed that the cost would be high ($15 to $20 million). \\"It‚Äôs a solemn responsibility, and it‚Äôs the best we can do for animals that are in captivity.\\" Filmography In 2010 the film Keiko: The Untold Story was released. In 2013 a New York Times video, The Whale Who Would Not Be Freed, included interviews about Keiko's return to the ocean. * Quincea√±era (1987; TV series), as himself * Keiko en peligro (1990), as himself * Free Willy (1993), as Willy * Free Willy 2: The Adventure Home (1995), as Willy * Azul (1996; TV series), as himself * Free Willy 3: The Rescue (1997), as Willy * Keiko: The Untold Story (2010), as himself * The Whale Who Would Not Be Freed (2013), as himself See also * List of famous whales References External links * The Free Willy Keiko Foundation * Keiko The Untold Story Documentary * Category:1976 animal births Category:2003 animal deaths Category:Animal actors Category:Deaths from pneumonia Category:Infectious disease deaths in Norway Category:Individual killer whales Category:Newport, Oregon Category:Oregon Coast ","title":"Keiko (killer whale)"},{"id":"399807","text":"Lewis Baltz (September 12, 1945 ‚Äì November 22, 2014) was a visual artist and photographer who became an important figure in the New Topographics movement of the late 1970s.Lewis Baltz Faculty Website at European Graduate School. His work has been published in a number of books, presented in numerous exhibitions, and appeared in museums such as the Museum of Modern Art, Paris, Museum of Contemporary Art, Helsinki, San Francisco Museum of Modern Art and The Whitney Museum of American Art, New York. He wrote for many journals, and contributed regularly to L'Architecture d'Aujourd'hui. Life and work Born in Newport Beach, California, Baltz graduated with a BFA in Fine Arts from San Francisco Art Institute in 1969 and held a Master of Fine Arts degree from Claremont Graduate School. He received several scholarships and awards including a scholarship from the National Endowment For the Arts (1973, 1977), the John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Fellowship (1977), US-UK Bicentennial Exchange Fellowship (1980) and Charles Brett Memorial Award (1991). In 2002 Baltz became a Professor for Photography at the European Graduate School in Saas-Fee, Switzerland. He lived his last years between Paris and Venice. His work is focused on searching for beauty in desolation and destruction. Baltz's images describe the architecture of the human landscape: offices, factories and parking lots. His pictures are the reflection of control, power, and influenced by and over human beings. His minimalistic photographs in the trilogy Ronde de Nuit, Docile Bodies, and Politics of Bacteria, picture the void of the other. In 1974 he captured the anonymity and the relationships between inhabitation, settlement and anonymity in The New Industrial Parks near Irvine, California (1974). Baltz moved to Europe in the late 1980s and started to use large colored prints. He published several books of his work including Geschichten von Verlangen und Macht, with Slavica Perkovic (Scalo, 1986). Other photographic series, including Sites of Technology (1989‚Äì92), depict the clinical, pristine interiors of hi-tech industries and government research centres, principally in France and Japan. His books and exhibitions, his \\"topographic work\\", such as The New Industrial Parks, Nevada, San Quentin Point, Candlestick Point (84 photographs documenting a public space near Candlestick Park, ruined by natural detritus and human intervention), expose the crisis of technology and define both objectivity and the role of the artist in photographs. In 1995, the story Deaths in Newport was produced as a book and CD-ROM. Baltz also produced a number of video works. Baltz died on November 22, 2014 at the age of 69 following a long illness.

His best known work in television was as the creator of the television series Alias Smith and Jones, Battlestar Galactica, Buck Rogers in the 25th Century, Quincy, M.E., The Hardy Boys/Nancy Drew Mysteries, B. J. and the Bear, The Fall Guy, Magnum, P.I. and Knight Rider. In addition to his television work, Larson also was a member of the folk revival/satire group The Four Preps.  Career  Larson began his career in the entertainment industry in 1956 as a member of the vocal group The Four Preps, with whom he appeared in one of the Gidget films. The Four Preps ultimately produced three gold records for Capitol, all of which Larson himself wrote and/or composed: \\"26 Miles (Santa Catalina)\\", \\"Big Man\\", and \\"Down by the Station\\". A later member of the Four Preps, David Somerville, and a session singer he knew, Gail Jensen, later collaborated with Larson to write and compose \\"The Unknown Stuntman\\", the theme from The Fall Guy; series lead Lee Majors performed this song over the opening titles. After working for Quinn Martin on productions including The Fugitive (where he had his first writing credit), Larson signed a production deal with Universal Studios. His first hit series was Alias Smith and Jones, a 1971‚Äì1973 Western which described the activities of Hannibal Heyes and Jedediah \\"Kid\\" Curry, concentrating on their efforts to go straight. (George Roy Hill's film, scripted by William Goldman, about Butch Cassidy and the \\"Sundance Kid\\", is commonly believed to have been the inspiration for the series.) Larson was involved in the development for television of The Six Million Dollar Man, based on Martin Caidin's novel Cyborg, into the successful series, and was one of the program's early executive producers. Larson later secured a then- unprecedented $1 million per episode budget for Battlestar Galactica. Originally, the series was intended to be called Adam's Ark, and the show incorporated many themes from LDS theology, such as marriage for \\"time and eternity\\" and a \\"council of twelve\\". Larson, a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in real life,\\"LDS Scene\\", Ensign, August 1979, 80. In 1979, Larson received an award from the Associated Latter-day Media Artists.Mormon Expression, \\"Episode 135: Battlestar Galactica and Mormon Theology\\" had been working on the concept since 1968, and former Star Trek producer Gene L. Coon had mentored him in its early development. Larson initially renamed the series Galactica but was then convinced to include the word \\"star\\" in the title in some way, in order to capitalize on the popularity of the recently released Star Wars, eventually deciding on Battlestar Galactica. Even with its generous budget, the series often recycled effects shots; it was canceled after one season. The pilot episode of Galactica, titled \\"Saga of a Star World\\" in the program continuity, was edited into a two-hour theatrical film released in North America and Europe (a second theatrical release, titled Mission Galactica: The Cylon Attack, was compiled by re-editing other episodes of the series). After the series was canceled, Larson went on to create a relatively low-budget sequel to the series, titled Galactica 1980, which was set many years later, when the Galactica had reached Earth. This series was less successful than the original and was canceled after 10 episodes. Larson re-used some of the sets, props, costumes, and effects work from Galactica for the light-hearted sci-fi series Buck Rogers in the 25th Century in 1979. Based on the comic-book character created in 1928 by Philip Francis Nowlan, Larson co-developed the series with Leslie Stevens. The feature-length pilot episode was released as a theatrical film in March 1979 and grossed $21 million at the North American box office.Box Office Mojo (Buck Rogers) The weekly television series began in September 1979, running for two seasons until April 1981. In the 1980s, Larson had further success as one of the creators of Magnum, P.I., which ran from 1980 to 1988. Additionally, Larson created The Fall Guy, which ran from 1981 to 1986. Larson's next prominent series was Knight Rider, which featured science-fiction elements with a light-hearted action-adventure scenario and limited violence. These basic elements characterized many of Larson's series' throughout the 1980s with Automan, Manimal and The Highwayman, though all of these shows were unsuccessful and none lasted more than a single season. Larson's profile declined, though he made a brief comeback in the 1990s with an adaptation of the Ultraverse comic Night Man, which lasted two seasons. In 2003, Battlestar Galactica was remade for the Sci-Fi Channel as a miniseries; it was followed by a 2004 series, that, unlike the original, lasted multiple seasons. Larson was not involved in any capacity with the new series, though he did receive a screen credit as \\"Consulting Producer\\". After the series ended in 2009, a short-lived prequel series, Caprica, followed in 2010. Larson was again not involved, but he was given a screen credit for the creation of certain characters. In February 2009, media sources reported that Larson was in talks with Universal Pictures to bring Battlestar Galactica to the big screen, though any potential feature film would not be based on the recent Sci-Fi Channel series remake, but would possibly be based on the original series. The project stalled for some time; in 2011 a re-announced version was now no longer a continuation of the original series but rather a complete remake. = Criticism = Despite his success, much criticism has been aimed at Larson for his perceived general lack of originality as many of his television series are seen as small screen \\"knock-offs\\" of feature films. Harlan Ellison once referred to him as \\"Glen Larceny\\" for the notorious similarities between Larson's shows and cinema blockbusters. In his autobiography, The Garner Files, James Garner stated that Larson stole a number of plots of The Rockford Files (which Garner's production company co-produced), then used them for his own shows, putting different characters in them. Garner's group complained to the Writer's Guild and Larson was fined, but Garner felt that the fine had taught Larson nothing when he persisted in plagiarism and later copied the theme music from The Rockford Files for one of his shows. Garner stated that when Larson subsequently showed up on the Rockford set, he put his arm around Garner and said \\"I hope there are no hard feelings, Jim.\\" After Larson ignored a warning by Garner to take his arm off him, Garner claims that he punched Larson so hard that Larson \\"flew across the curb, into a motor home, and out the other side.\\"James Garner & Jon Winokur. The Garner Files: A Memoir. Simon & Schuster, 2011. . Chapter 7: \\"The Rockford Files\\" (page 129). = Lawsuit against Universal Studios = In July 2011, Larson began a lawsuit against Universal Studios, alleging a decades-long fraud and claimed the studio had not paid him a share of the profits owed from the television shows he produced while working with them. Larson's involvement with Universal had begun in the 1970s, and his contractual agreement had secured him net profits from the revenues generated by the shows he worked on as a producer, including The Six Million Dollar Man, Quincy, M.E., Battlestar Galactica, Buck Rogers in the 25th Century, Magnum, P.I. and Knight Rider. The dispute was settled four years later in December 2015. This was not the first legal wrangle Larson had with the studio, as there had previously been a disagreement over ownership of rights to the Battlestar Galactica franchise. It was ultimately determined that Larson no longer owned the television rights to the property, but retained feature film rights.  Death  Larson died on November 14, 2014 in UCLA Medical Center, Santa Monica, California, from esophageal cancer, aged 77. He is buried at Rose Hill Burial Park (Oklahoma City, Oklahoma).

In the first sense, strict and more popular, weak consistency is one of the consistency models used in the domain of concurrent programming (e.g. in distributed shared memory, distributed transactions etc.). A protocol is said to support weak consistency if: #All accesses to synchronization variables are seen by all processes (or nodes, processors) in the same order (sequentially) - these are synchronization operations. Accesses to critical sections are seen sequentially. #All other accesses may be seen in different order on different processes (or nodes, processors). #The set of both read and write operations in between different synchronization operations is the same in each process. Therefore, there can be no access to a synchronization variable if there are pending write operations. And there can not be any new read/write operation started if the system is performing any synchronization operation. In the second, more general, sense weak consistency may be applied to any consistency model weaker than sequential consistency. A stricter condition is strong consistency, where parallel processes can observe only one consistent state. References * The original paper on weak ordering: M. Dubois, C. Scheurich and F. A.

His Civil War trilogy, North and South, has sold millions of copies worldwide. He is also the author of The Kent Family Chronicles. He has used the pen name Jay Scotland. Early life and education Jakes was born in Chicago, Illinois. He first sold stories to pulp magazines while still in college in the early 1950s. Jakes studied creative writing at DePauw University, Greencastle, Indiana, graduating in 1953. He then earned an M.A. in American literature from The Ohio State University. He and Rachel, to whom had been married for 13 months at the time, appeared on the game show Beat the Clock on August 23, 1952. Although they failed to complete the Bonus Round, Rachel won for them a Sylvania \\"Jefferson\\" 20\\" screen television set. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8NWqHrXAmY Writing career Cover of Science Fiction Quarterly featuring John Jakes' \\"The Taint\\" Thrilling Wonder Stories, edited by Sam Merwin, published two 1949‚Äì1950 letters from Jakes and two of his stories were published in pulp magazines edited by Howard Browne late in 1950, The Dreaming Trees (Fantastic Adventures, November) and \\"Your Number is Up!\\" (Amazing Stories, December). ISFDB catalogs 28 more speculative fiction stories published 1951 to 1953. Jakes published dozens of stories and several novels during the twenty years following completion of college, many of them fantasy fiction, science fiction and westerns and other sorts of historical fiction, while working in the advertising industry. In 1971, he began to write full-time. During this time, he was a member of the Swordsmen and Sorcerers' Guild of America (SAGA), a loose-knit group of heroic fantasy authors founded in the 1960s and led by Lin Carter. The eight original members were self-selected by fantasy credentials alone. They sought to promote the popularity and respectability of the \\"Sword and Sorcery\\" sub genre (such as Brak the Barbarian stories by Jakes). Jakes gained widespread popularity with the publication of his Kent Family Chronicles, which became a bestselling American Bicentennial Series of books in the mid to late 1970s, selling 55 million copies. He has since published several more popular works of historical fiction, most dealing with American history, including the North and South trilogy about the U.S. Civil War, which sold 10 million copies and was adapted as an ABC-TV miniseries. Personal Jakes lives in Florida with his wife, Rachel, to whom he has been married since 1951. They have four grown children: Andrea, Dr. Ellen, J. Michael, and Victoria.

Due to its remote and rocky alpine habitat it is rarely seen. There are currently six recognized subspecies. It is one of four species of rosy finches. Taxonomy Female - Sandia Peak - New Mexico The gray-crowned rosy finch was first classified by English ornithologist William John Swainson in 1832. This bird has been thought to form a superspecies with three other rosy finches (also known as mountain finch): black rosy finch (L. atrata) and the brown-capped rosy finch (L. australis), all of which were classified as the same species as the Asian rosy finch (L. arctoa) from 1983‚Äì1993. Recent mitochondrial DNA evidence shows the rosy finches are all indeed very closely related and can be easily confused with one another. Along with one Asian rosy finch and two Asian mountain finches, the three North American rosy finches form the mountain finch genus Leucosticte. Alternative common names include: Roselin √† t√™te grise (in French), Schwarzstirn-Schneegimpel (in German), and Pinz√≥n Montano Nuquigr√≠s (in Spanish). =Subspecies= Six subspecies of the gray- crowned rosy finch are now recognized, though proposals for additional subspecies have been recognized. *L. t. griseonucha (J. F. Brandt, 1842) Commander Island, and Aleutian Islands (including Shumagin Island and Semidi Island) east to Alaskan Peninsula; non-breeding south to Kodiak Island. *L. t. umbrina (O. Murie, 1944) Hall Island, St. Matthew Island and Pribilof Islands, in Bering Sea. *L. t. littoralis (S. F. Baird, 1869) also known as \\"Hepburn‚Äôs rosy-finch\\", \\"gray-headed rosy-finch\\", \\"gray-cheeked rosy-finch\\", breeds in south-central Alaska east to western Canada (SW Yukon, NW British Columbia) and western United States from Washington and Oregon (along Cascade Mountains) to northern California (Mt Shasta); winters in southern section of breeding range East to central Montana, western Nevada, northern Utah and central New Mexico. *L. t. tephrocotis (Swainson, 1832) also known as \\"brown-cheeked rosy- finch\\", breeds northern & central Alaska east to northwest Canada (central Yukon, British Columbia, western Alberta) and northwest United States (northwest Montana); winters from southern British Columbia east to southwest Saskatchewan and South Dakota, south to northeast California, Nevada, Utah, western Colorado and northern New Mexico. *L. t. wallowa (A. H. Miller, 1939) breeds northeast Oregon (Wallowa Mts); winters South to west-central Nevada and central-east California. *L. t. dawsoni (J. Grinnell, 1913) eastern California (Sierra Nevada and White Mts). Description Mount Adams, Washington Within the finch family, the gray-crowned rosy finch is medium- large with a comparatively long notched tail and wing. Adults are brown on the back and breast and mainly pink on the rest of the underparts and the wings. The forehead and throat are black; the back of the head is grey. They have short black legs and a long forked tail. There is some variability in the amount of grey on the head. Adult females and juveniles are similar. Overall length is , wingspan , and weight . L. t. wallowa has an almost entirely gray head. The Pribilof and Aleutian subspecies have a length of and weight of , about twice the size of the other subspecies. The black rosy finch has a black instead of brown body and the brown-capped rosy finch is a lighter brown and lacks the gray face patch. Distribution and habitat The ancestor of the three species of North American rosy finches migrated from Asia. All rosy finches live in an alpine or tundra environment. The gray-crowned rosy finch has a wide range and large numbers throughout Alaska, and western Canada and the United States. L. t. griseonucha permanently resides in the Aleutian Islands and umbrina on the Pribilof Islands. A small number of gray-crowned rosy finches winters on the mainland in South-Central Alaska and visits feeders there. The other taxa: littoralis, tephrocotis, wallowa, and dawsoni are found from the Canadian and American Rockies and migrate south to the western United States. L. t. tephrocotis summers from Montana to the Yukon, while littoralis breeds closer to the coast, from northern California to west- central Alaska. Due to its remote habitat, few of its nests have been found, it is rarely spotted, and the population is stable. They are invariably found amongst rocks. The areas the subspecies breed in rarely overlap during breeding season. Males typically outnumber females throughout the year. An individual was seen north of Boonville, in Lewis County, NY beginning on Sunday, March 4 through at least Thursday, March 8. This is only the second confirmed report for New York State. Behavior Rosy finches are very environment-specific. In the summer their breeding habitat is rocky islands and barren areas on mountains from Alaska to the northwestern United States. These mountain breeding areas tend to be snowfields and rocky scree. When not breeding they form large flocks of over 1000 individuals which are sometimes known to include snow buntings (P. nivalis), Lapland longspurs (C. lapponicus), and horned larks (E. alpestris), as well as other rosy-finch species. They descend in flocks as far as the fringes of the western plains beginning in autumn when the snows get deep. They return to alpine regions when snow is still deep in early spring. They may breed at a higher altitude than any other breeding bird in North America. Due to these extreme breeding altitudes, they are very difficult to observe during breeding times. They build a cup nest in mid-June at a sheltered, hidden location on the ground or on a cliff and are monogamous. They are known to use protected areas such as mine shafts and abandoned buildings for nesting. Both sexes collect the nesting material of grass, roots, lichen, moss, and sedge, but only the female builds the nest. Lining material consists of fine grass, hair, and feathers. The female lays 3‚Äì5 eggs which she incubates for approximately two weeks. Both sexes feed the chicks, which leave the nest after 2‚Äì3 weeks. Chicks continue to be fed by their parents for about two weeks after leaving the nest in late July or early August. A male will defend its female's territory during breeding season, not just the nest but wherever she goes. This behavior is common with the rosy finches. These birds forage on the ground; many fly to catch insects in flight. During the summer they mainly eat insects, such as cutworms, that were caught in updrafts and frozen in snowfields. They also feed in the meadows near snowfields. In the winter they eat seeds from weeds and grasses such as Russian thistle (E. exaltatus), mustard, and sunflower (H. annuus). When breeding, both males and females develop throat pouches, known as gular pouches or gular skin, to carry food to their chicks, a trait seen in only one other North American genus, Pinicola. The three subspecies that live in mountain interiors have brown cheeks instead of gray cheeks. They show little fear of humans. They often feed in small flocks. Their call is a buzz- sounding \\"chew\\". They can be approached to within . References Further reading =Book= * MacDougall-Shackleton, S. A., R. E. Johnson, and T. P. Hahn. 2000.

In a uniprocessor system (whereby, in today's terms, there exists only one core), there is only one processing element doing all the work and therefore only one processing element that can read or write from/to a given memory location. As a result, when a value is changed, all subsequent read operations of the corresponding memory location will see the updated value, even if it is cached. Conversely, in multiprocessor (or multicore) systems, there are two or more processing elements working at the same time, and so it is possible that they simultaneously access the same memory location. Provided none of them changes the data in this location, they can share it indefinitely and cache it as they please. But as soon as one updates the location, the others might work on an out-of-date copy that, e.g., resides in their local cache. Consequently, some scheme is required to notify all the processing elements of changes to shared values; such a scheme is known as a memory coherence protocol, and if such a protocol is employed the system is said to have a coherent memory. The exact nature and meaning of the memory coherency is determined by the consistency model that the coherence protocol implements. In order to write correct concurrent programs, programmers must be aware of the exact consistency model that is employed by their systems. When implemented in hardware, the coherency protocol can, for example, be directory based or snooping based (also called sniffing). Specific protocols include the MSI protocol and its derivatives MESI, MOSI and MOESI.

The agency is directly responsible to the Prime Minister of Greece, who can appoint or dismiss the Director and his deputies. EYP employs the following categories of personnel: * Permanent civilian personnel. * Scientific civilian personnel, serving on the basis of private contracts of employment. * A number of officers on active service in the Armed Forces, the Coast Guard or the Hellenic Police. An unspecified number of national field agents are also employed. History The first modern Greek intelligence agency was created in February 1908, with the Information Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs fulfilling the role. It was headed by Panagiotis Danglis, a military officer and member of the Hellenic Macedonian Committee one of the secret organizations taking part in the Macedonian Struggle. The Information Department's goal was the promotion of Greek propaganda as well as the collection economic and military intelligence, through a network of Greek consulates in Ottoman controlled Macedonia. The Department did not absorb or even collaborate with private Greek secret organizations that continued to act independently. Events such as the Goudi coup and the Young Turk Revolution, prompted a sharp reduction of Greek activity in Macedonia and the eventual dissolution of the agency in November 1909. At the outbreak of World War I Greece remained neutral. The National Schism divided the country into Royalists and Venizelists. Individual members of the military and the diplomatic corps focused their attention on collecting information on their political enemies. In June 1917, king Constantine I of Greece was deposed and the country entered the war on the side of the Entente. Greek officers gained valuable experience on aerial reconnaissance and interrogation techniques from their French and British allies during their tenure on the Macedonian front. In 1923, Italy occupied the Greek island of Corfu after accusing the latter of assassinating the Italian general Enrico Tellini. The Corfu incident prompted Greece to create the Corfu Information Center under Georgios Fessopoulos. The Center was tasked with countering Italian propaganda, disrupting trade with Italy, limiting Catholic proselytism and the use of the Italian language. Apart from that the Center also monitored the activities of Armenian refugees and pacifists residing on the island, for fear that they might be communist agents. On 25 September 1925, Theodoros Pangalos founded the National Special Security Service (YAK) under the auspices of the Hellenic Gendarmerie. Tasked with combating the seditious Communist Party of Greece, the organization was paralyzed by an internal power struggle. On 27 December, Fessopulos took over the YAK On 29 January 1926, YAK was renamed into the National General Security Service (YGAK), which now fell under the command of the Ministry of the Interior. The YGAK continued to gather intelligence on communists and illegal aliens. In August 1926, Pangalos was overthrown in a countercoup by Georgios Kondylis. Kondylis dissolved YGAK due to its close affiliation with Pangalos, leaving Greece without an intelligence agency for the next ten years. In January 1936, the State Defense Service (Œ•œÄŒ∑œÅŒµœÉŒØŒ±œÇ ŒëŒºœçŒΩŒ∑œÇ œÑŒøœÖ ŒöœÅŒ¨œÑŒøœÖœÇ) was established under the Ministry for Military Affairs. It's responsibilities included \\"monitoring of foreign propaganda carried out against the State, the movement and dwelling of foreign nationals in the country, the collection of intelligence relating to the security of the State and the introduction of counter-measures.\\" In November 5 of that year, the service was dissolved by the Metaxas Regime & was replaced by the Deputy Ministry for Public Security (Œ•œÜœÖœÄŒøœÖœÅŒ≥ŒµŒØŒø ŒîŒ∑ŒºœåœÉŒπŒ±œÇ ŒëœÉœÜŒ¨ŒªŒµŒπŒ±œÇ).http://www.nis.gr/portal/page/portal/NIS/History/BeforeEYP The agency, in its current form, was founded on 7 May 1953 (Law 2421/1953) under the name Central Intelligence Service (, ŒöŒ•Œ†). On 27 August 1986, it was renamed and re-established as the National Intelligence Service (, ŒïŒ•Œ†) by ministerial decree. The agency was created by influential Greek American CIA agents, the most famous being Thomas Karamessines, who later rose to become Deputy Director for Plans in the CIA.Linardatos, Apo ton Emfylio sti Hounda, 1979 Its first, most influential and longest-serving Director was Alexandros Natsinas, a Lieutenant General of Artillery and veteran of World War II and the Greek Civil War. He headed the agency from its founding in May 1953 until December 1963. At the end of World War II, Albania came to be dominated by Enver Hoxha's communist party which owed its ascension to power in part to the British MI6 which actively supported it during the war. The outbreak of the Cold War made Britain reverse its position on Albania initiating the Albanian Subversion operation. Britain sought the assistance of Greece which at the time was hostile towards Albania due to its territorial claims in Northern Epirus and Albania's support for the Democratic Army of Greece. British reliance on the Albanian nationalist Balli Komb√´tar militia created reluctance in the Greek intelligence community to collaborate with their erstwhile enemies. Nevertheless, the Manetta Villa in the Athenian suburb of Kifissia was used as a training ground for Albanian anticommunist guerillas. A MI6 communication center was set up in the Bibelli Villa in north east Corfu and an Albanian language propaganda radio station operated from the Alkyonides Islands. The latter came under the control of Central Intelligence Agency in 1950 and continued to function for four more years. KYPE supplied the British with information acquired from the Greek community in Albania as well as political refugees living in Lavrio camp. The Albanian Subversion was ultimately revealed by KGB double agent Kim Philby, the Albanian authorities conducted numerous arrests thus foiling the plot. Between 1952 and 1961 KYPE and its successor KYP conducted a campaign of cultural propaganda against the Greek communist party (KKE) and the United Democratic Left (EDA). Reports were issued on the Trotskyist Fourth International as well as Titoism, those two currents of communism were to be reinforced in order to spread discord among the country's leftists. On 17 November 1953, KYP proposed conducting tax audits on suspected communist book publishers and cinema owners, censoring Soviet movies and promoting Soviet films of particularly low quality. In 1959, KYP launched exhibitions of Soviet products in Volos, Thessaloniki and Piraeus. The bulk of the products were cheap and defective, purposefully selected to tarnish the Soviet Union's image. In 1961, propaganda brochures such as \\"The Mishellenic Propaganda of the Slavs and the Macedonian Question\\" and \\"KKE and Northern Epirus\\" were printed and sent out to regional newspapers in the north of the country. At the very beginning, the agency appointed an anticommunist role, as the country was under the consequences of the civil war and all the countries at the northern borders, were under communist regimes. KYP was controlled by the CIA; in the first eleven years of its history (1953‚Äì1964) its agents received their salaries from the Americans, not the Greek state, until Prime Minister Georgios Papandreou, enraged with this level of dependence, stopped this practice. During the Regime of the Colonels (1967‚Äì1974), KYP actively continued its anticommunist action. Between the late 1970s and the 1990s, KYP and EYP monitored the activities of foreign terrorist organizations such as the German Red Army Faction, the Palestinian Abu Nidal Organization, the Japanese Red Army, the Armenian ASALA, and the Turkish, PKK and Dev Sol. The presence of latter two was tolerated by Greece due to its geopolitical conflict with Turkey. Their members received political asylum, mainly settling in the Lavrio refugee camp. Despite PKK's designation as a terrorist organization its members openly raised funds within Greece. Their activities were gradually restricted following the 1999 Greek‚ÄìTurkish earthquake diplomacy thaw. After Andreas Papandreou came to power in 1981, he was determined to totally control the state apparatus, including the intelligence services, which historically had been staffed exclusively by people with right-wing political views. The external attention was focused on the relations towards Turkey. He appointed as head of KYP Lieutenant General Georgios Politis, a close friend of retired General, PASOK MP and minister Antonis Drosogiannis; Politis organized a massive purge of right-wing personnel.Economist Foreign report, vol 1805‚Äì1840, 1984 KYP became a civilian agency, EYP, by Ministerial Decree 1645/86. In recent years, its directors have been diplomats, while traditionally they were military officers. In late May 1985, KYP agents monitoring the activities of the Soviet embassy in Athens realized that its sports secretary Sergei Bokhan had vanished under mysterious circumstances. KYP suspected Bokhan to be either a KGB or a GRU operative, as was an approximate 40% of the embassy's staff. Valery Goncharouk another suspected GRU agent and embassy worker also unexpectedly returned to Moscow. Unbeknownst to Greece Bokhan had been a MI6 double agent since 1974. On 17 May, Bokhan received an order to urgently return to the USSR in order to confirm a promotion. Fearing that his cover had been blown he escaped to USA with the help of CIA. Bokhan's testimony was passed to KYP, revealing that he and Goncharouk had established a network of collaborators most of whom worked in the high tech sector. Amongst them were Greek navy officers specializing in computer engineering, a Greek contractor producing FIM-92 Stinger missiles and a contractor for the French defense manufacturer Thomson-CSF. The latter two were acquitted after the judge presiding over their case claimed that they had the right to engage in industrial espionage as the technology in question belonged to a foreign nation. The fact that the folders containing the documents were mailed through the regular post service and were not properly marked as classified also played a role in the court's decision. The court martial also ended in the officer's favor, after Bokhan's testimony was judged to be inadequate for a conviction. In 1989, New Democracy MP Pavlos Bakoyannis was assassinated by members of Revolutionary Organization 17 November. New Democracy and CIA leveled the accusation that the PASOK political party was behind the creation of 17 November and Revolutionary People's Struggle (ELA) another Greek far left terrorist organization. The New Democracy leadership continued to insist that the former had collaborated with PASOK even after 17 November disbanded in 2003. 17 November had in fact been founded by Alexandros Giotopoulos, a staunch opponent of the Greek military junta of 1967‚Äì1974 and former member of the Paris anti‚Äìjunta circles. On 5 March 1991, EYP conducted a series of arrests of Palestinian terrorists in Athens, seizing a number of explosive devices. On 19 April 1991, Islamic Jihad Movement in Palestine militant Hashaykem Ahmed perpetrated a bombing in the city of Patras. The bombing resulted in seven fatalities and an equal number of injured. EYP had warned the central police headquarters that the leader of the local Palestinian student's union was an Islamic Jihad member and possessed weaponry on 3 April. On 16 April, EYP once again issued a communique warning of a possible Islamic Jihad attack in Patras. It was later revealed that the central police headquarters had failed to pass the information to their Patras colleagues. A connection between the perpetrators of the bombing and the Palestine Liberation Organization led to the expulsion of five Palestinian diplomats and eight other Palestinians. The level of EYP's awareness of Islamic Jihad's movements within the country led to allegations by a number of people including the former interior minister Ioannis Skoularikis that the bombing had been a false flag operation by either CIA or Mossad. During the recent years, EYP has also been active regarding cases of corruption in Greek football, such as the 2015 Greek football scandal and various attacks to Greek referees.Persons involved in referee attack Other information The agency's motto is the ancient Greek phrase \\"\\" (translated roughly as \\"do not discuss confidential affairs\\"), a quote attributed to the Corinthian tyrant and philosopher Periander. The total number of people working for the agency is unknown and remains classified; the Greek media usually give figures of around 3,000. EYP is rumored to operate one of the largest criminal databases of any intelligence agency. In addition, it possesses a large volume of classified information about criminal hubs, activities and organizations operating throughout the European Union.

In his career, Godwin published three novels and around thirty short stories. He is best known for his short story, \\"The Cold Equations\\". Published in 1954, the short story was Godwin‚Äôs fourth work to be published and was one whose controversial dark ending helped redefine the genre. Early life and education Godwin was born in Maryland in 1915. He had a rough childhood that was marked by much loss and suffering. At the age of five, his younger sister died as a result of an accidental shooting that occurred after he had been ‚Äúplaying with the gun that killed her‚Äù. After his mother‚Äôs death, he was raised by his father who he did not have the best relationship with. He withdrew from school after the third grade, but he went on to teach himself multiple other subjects to expand his knowledge and be able to write better stories. Personal life Godwin had a spinal disorder known as Kyphosis, which results in a curvature of the spine, making him appear hunchbacked. He spent a few months in the Army before he was discharged due to his spinal condition worsening. In the early 1960s, Godwin was living in a remote area of northwestern Arizona with his father writing and making his own drywashers to sell. It was in the summer of 1961 that he met his future wife, Laureola Godwin, and then twelve-year-old step-daughter who he later adopted, Diane Godwin Sullivan, through the sale of one of his drywashers. He went on to base two of the main characters in his second novel, The Space Barbarians, after them. He worked for the forest service in Washington state for a short period of time. His wife died from a heart attack in the early 1970s. This was something that had a heavy impact on him for the rest of his life. After living with his adopted daughter and her family in Texas for some time after his wife‚Äôs death, he moved to Nevada. Death Throughout his life, Godwin battled with alcohol abuse with varying degrees of success in being able to control it. It was his wife‚Äôs death that eventually led him to be ‚Äúconsume[d]‚Äù by drinking which led to many health problems. Godwin died in a Las Vegas hospital in the summer of 1980. He did not have any identification on him so his body was held at a funeral home until a friend of his who was a physician assistant learned of his death and contacted his daughter, Diane.

These expeditions promoted the career of Johann Reinhold Forster and the findings became the bedrock of colonial professionalism and helped set the stage for the future development of anthropology and ethnology. They also laid the framework for general concern about the impact that alteration of the physical environment for European economic expansion would have on exotic societies.Richard Grove, Green Imperialism: Colonial Expansion, Tropical Island Edens and the Origins of Environmentalism, 1600‚Äì1860 (Cambridge University Press, 1995), pp 309‚Äì375. Biography Johann Reinhold Forster and Georg Forster in Tahiti, by John Francis Rigaud (1742‚Äì1810), 1780. Forster's family originated in the Lords Forrester in Scotland from where his great- grandfather had emigrated after losing most of his property during the rule of Oliver Cromwell along with many other Scots. Forster himself was born in the city of Dirschau (now )Tczew, in the province of Royal Prussia, in the Crown of Poland. He studied languages and natural history at the Joachimsthal Gymnasium in Berlin, theology at the University of Halle, afterwards serving as a Protestant pastor in Mokry Dw√≥r (Nassenhuben) Pomeranian Voivodship. He married his cousin Elisabeth Nikolai. They had several children including a son, Georg Forster and a daughter Virginia Viktoria. In 1765 he accepted an offer made to him by the Russian government to inspect and report upon the new colonies founded on the banks of the Volga, in the province of Saratov. His irritable temper soon involved him in difficulties with the Russian government, and in the following year he went with Georg (the eldest of eight children, seven of which survived childhood) to England and became teacher of natural history at Warrington, Lancashire. He spent three years teaching at the Dissenting Warrington Academy, succeeding Joseph Priestley. Compelled by his violent temper to resign this appointment, Forster then moved with his son to London, where they earned a precarious living by doing translations. In 1771, he published A Catalogue of the Animals of North America,Forster, Johann R. 1771. A catalogue of the animals of North America. 'containing, an enumeration of the known quadrupeds, birds, reptiles, fish, insects, crustaceous and testaceous animals; many of which are new, and never described before, to which is added, short directions for collecting, preserving, and transporting, all kinds of natural history curiosities.

In July 1772 they set sail on the Resolution, returning to England in July 1775. During a stop in Cape Town, Forster engaged Anders Sparrman to act as his assistant. Both the Forsters kept detailed diaries of everything they saw on the voyage, and made extensive collections of both natural history specimens and artefacts. Based on his father's journals, Georg published A Voyage Round the World in 1777. Reinhold Forster published Observations Made during a Voyage round the World (1778).J.R. Forster (1778) However the income from the book was insufficient to clear his debts, and the bulk of Georg's drawings from the voyage had to be sold to Joseph Banks. During the next few years Forster undertook a variety of writing work, including a German translation of Thomas Pennant's Arctic Zoology. G. Robinson, 1778) In November 1779 Forster was appointed Professor of Natural history and Mineralogy at the University of Halle, and director of the Botanische Garten der Martin-Luther-Universit√§t Halle-Wittenberg, where he remained until his death. His Descriptiones animalium, completed within a month of returning to England with Cook, was eventually edited by Hinrich Lichtenstein and published in 1844.(in latin) Descriptiones animalium quae in itinere ad Maris Australis terras per annos 1772, 1773 et 1774 suscepto collegit observavit et delineavit Ionannes Reinoldus Forster Berolini ex officina Academica MDCCCXLIV.

The newly elected members of the 19th D√°il assembled at Leinster House on 2 July when the new Taoiseach and government were appointed. The general election took place in 42 parliamentary constituencies throughout Ireland for 144 seats in the lower house of parliament, D√°il √âireann. Campaign The general election of 1969 saw two new leaders of the two main parties fight their first general election. Jack Lynch of Fianna F√°il had become Taoiseach in 1966 and was attempting to win his first election. Liam Cosgrave had taken charge of Fine Gael in 1965 and was now leading his party into his first election. Brendan Corish was fighting his third general election as leader of the Labour Party. Fianna F√°il had been in power since 1957, and in spite of media predictions the party was still very popular with the voters. Its leader Jack Lynch proved to be the party's biggest electoral asset. His quiet, easy-going and reassuring style, coupled with the catchy slogan \\"Let's back Jack!\\", attracted many new voters to Fianna F√°il. The party had introduced many innovative pieces of legislation during the 1960s and was now looking for a fresh mandate. Fianna F√°il were also helped by a deeply divided opposition. Fine Gael had internal divisions. There was tension between the older conservative members, who wanted to keep the party as it was, and the younger deputies who wanted to move the party to the left. One of the party's policies proposed to abolish compulsory Irish for State examinations and civil service jobs. The Labour Party on the other hand were predicted to make massive gains after firmly ruling out a pre-election pact with Fine Gael. The party fielded a number of new, high-profile candidates, including Justin Keating, Conor Cruise O'Brien, David Thornley and No√´l Browne. The slogan \\"The Seventies will be Socialist\\" was popular with Labour supporters; however, Fianna F√°il played the \\"red card\\", linking the Labour Party with communism. The tactic worked successfully. Result } *Fianna F√°il majority government formed. The result marked a third successive victory for Fianna F√°il, led by Jack Lynch. Fianna F√°il and Fine Gael each lost votes, yet gained seats. Labour gained votes, yet lost seats.

Biography  Thomas Mayo Brewer was born in Boston, the younger brother of noted Boston merchant Gardner Brewer. He graduated from Harvard College in 1835 and from Harvard Medical School three years later. His interest in ornithology was such that he was elected a member of the Boston Society of Natural History in 1835. He abandoned his career as a doctor after a few years to concentrate on ornithology, writing and politics, later becoming editor of the Boston Atlas in 1840. He was a friend of John James Audubon in that ornithologist's later life.Drobnicki, John A. \\"Thomas Mayo Brewer\\" Biographical Dictionary of American and Canadian Naturalists,\\" 1997 In 1849, Brewer was placed in charge of the oological department for the Boston Society of Natural History. Brewer continued working as a publisher while working as an ornithologist. He joined the publishing firm of Hickling, Swan & Brown, which became Hickling, Swan & Brewer when he became a partner in 1857; this firm subsequently became Swan, Brewer & Tileston.Brewer, Wilmon, Looking Backwards, Marshall Jones Company, Francestown, NH, 1985The Ohio Journal of Education, February 1857, p. 62. As an editor, he published Alexander Wilson's \\"Birds of America\\".Ripley, George and Charles Anderson Dana. The American Cyclop√¶dia, 1881. In 1857, Brewer completed his first of several volumes of North American Oology. However, Brewer is best known as a joint author, with Spencer Fullerton Baird and Robert Ridgway, of A History of North American Birds (3 volumes, 1874), which was the first attempt since John James Audubon's (thirty years prior) to complete the study of American ornithology. Brewer also contributed to a number of ornithological publications, including John James Audubon's Ornithological Biography. Brewer was a companion to Audubon, who gave Brewer's name to a duck, a blackbird, and a small mammal (Brewer's shrew mole) found on Martha's vineyard.Milne, John, \\"Once-notable family has its history sold to the highest bidder,\\" Boston Globe, Metro section, p. 16, May 29, 1995, Boston, MA. In his last decade of life, Brewer sparred with Elliott Coues over the fate of the House Sparrow, a recently introduced bird that was multiplying far faster than expected. While Coues and most ornithologists were in favor of killing many of them off, Brewer tried to defend them. This ornithological event is known as \\"The Sparrow War.\\"Barrow, Mark V. A Passion for Birds. Princeton University Press, 1998. Brewer died in Boston on January 24, 1880 while the fate of the sparrow was still being debated. Personal life Brewer married Sally Coffin in 1849. They had two children. The Brewer family has been prominent in Massachusetts for 200 years, including James Brewer (1742‚Äì1806), an early American patriot leader and businessman, Gen. Wilmon Blackmar, a Civil War medal of honor winner, and Wilmon Brewer, a poet, biographer, and philanthropist.Milne, John, \\"Once- notable family has its history sold to the highest bidder,\\" Boston Globe, Metro section, p. 16, May 29, 1995, Boston, MA.

The newly elected members of the 18th D√°il assembled at Leinster House on 21 April when the new Taoiseach and government were appointed. The general election took place in 42 parliamentary constituencies throughout Ireland for 144 seats in the lower house of parliament, D√°il √âireann. Campaign The general election of 1965 was caused by the ruling Fianna F√°il party's failure to gain a seat in a by- election. The success of Eileen Desmond of the Labour Party in Cork Mid in holding a seat previously held by her husband Dan Desmond, led to an unacceptable mathematical situation with regard to the government's majority. The Taoiseach, Se√°n Lemass immediately dissolved the D√°il and the campaign began in earnest. Fianna F√°il ran its campaign on its record in government. Over the last number of years the economy had seen a huge improvement and the party played up on its record in government. The party also played up heavily on the personality of the party leader with the slogan \\"Let Lemass Lead On\\". Fine Gael put forward a comprehensive manifesto, which included the establishment of a government department concerned with economic planning. However, the older, conservative members of the party did not warm to the new turn the party was taking. Television and radio This was the first Irish General Election to be covered on television by state broadcaster RT√â, which had formed on 31 December 1961. Election Newsroom was broadcast live on Telef√≠s √âireann from their Donnybrook studios in Dublin, presented by John O'Donoghue with analysis provided by John Healy (Irish Times), John O'Sullivan (The Cork Examiner), Garret FitzGerald and Professor Basil Chubb. Cameras were present in four count centres: Bolton Street (Dublin), Wexford, Cork and Monaghan. The GPO provided direct links as results were announced. Raidi√≥ √âireann provided special coverage from 3 pm on the day of the count due to the coverage on Telef√≠s √âireann. It was a new approach to election coverage on the state's radio service, which began broadcasting in 1926. Result } *Fianna F√°il majority government formed. The general election gave Fianna F√°il an extra two seats, and with it an overall majority in the D√°il. Se√°n Lemass continued as Taoiseach.

The newly elected members of the 17th D√°il assembled at Leinster House on 11 October, when the new Taoiseach and government were appointed. The general election took place in 38 parliamentary constituencies throughout Ireland for 144 seats in the lower house of parliament, D√°il √âireann, which had been reduced in size by three seats from the previous election. Campaign The general election of 1961 saw the three main parties being led by three new leaders. Se√°n Lemass had taken charge of Fianna F√°il in 1959. It was also the first time Fianna F√°il faced a general election campaign without √âamon de Valera (who was by this time President of Ireland). James Dillon had taken over at Fine Gael in 1959 also, while the Labour Party was now under the leadership of Brendan Corish. While the election was caused by the \\"crisis\\" surrounding Ireland's application for membership of the European Economic Community and various other international affairs, little attention was paid to these matters during the campaign; the 1961 general election has become known as the dullest campaign on record, with the most important issue being the teaching of the Irish language in schools. Fianna F√°il fought the election on its record in government and a reforming theme; Fine Gael presented itself as the party of free enterprise. The Labour Party campaigned strongly against the \\"conservative\\" Fianna F√°il and Fine Gael parties. It also favoured major expansion in the public sector.

It was the longest election campaign in the history of the state spanning 30 days. The newly elected members of the 16th D√°il assembled at Leinster House on 20 March when the new Taoiseach and government were appointed. The general election took place in 40 parliamentary constituencies throughout Ireland for 147 seats in the lower house of parliament, D√°il √âireann. Campaign The general election of 1957 was precipitated by the crisis in the trade balance and the government's reaction to it. As a result of this Fianna F√°il tabled a motion of no confidence in the inter-party government of Fine Gael, Labour and Clann na Talmhan. Rather than face defeat in the vote the Taoiseach John A. Costello, decided to dissolve the D√°il and let the people decide. The campaign was fought largely over economic issues and the situation in the North. In the north the IRA launched Operation Harvest which drew much popular support in the south. Sinn F√©in had been re-built and re-organized as a party by Paddy McLogan and was fielding abstentionist candidates. Fianna F√°il had produced a major policy document in January, criticising many of its own policies in regard to the economy. While they did not know an election was imminent this became the backbone of their manifesto. The importance of free trade was played up by Fianna F√°il in a clear rejection of the protectionist policies they had advocated in the past. The architect of many of these new policies was the spokesperson for Industry and Commerce and the heir-apparent of the party, Se√°n Lemass. At 75 years of age √âamon de Valera was fighting his last general election as leader of the party. In spite of his age he carried out a vigorous campaign, often being accompanied by brass bands and torch-lit processions. The Fianna F√°il message was simple: coalition governments were unstable. The other parties, most of them having enjoyed a stint in government over the previous three years, fought the election on their record in office, Fine Gael in particular. Clann na Talmhan failed to broaden their appeal and remained the voice of the farmers. Clann na Poblachta under Sean MacBride had agreed not to stand in constituencies where Sinn F√©in were fielding candidates and never made the breakthrough it had hoped for and lost two of its three seats. Sinn F√©in, fighting one of its first post-war elections polled well on an abstentionist ticket, winning 4 seats Result } *Fianna F√°il majority government formed.

Previously he was the Prime Minister of Uzbekistan from 2003Brief profile of Mirziyoyev , Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty.\\"South Korea, Uzbekistan Sign Uranium Deal\\", RadioFreeEurope/RadioLiberty, 25 September 2006. to 2016. Following the death of President Islam Karimov, he was appointed by the Supreme Assembly as interim president of Uzbekistan on 8 September 2016. He was subsequently elected as president in the December 2016 presidential election, winning 88.6% of the vote, and was sworn in on 14 December 2016. Life and career In 1981, Mirziyoyev graduated from the Tashkent Institute of Irrigation and Melioration. He holds a Candidate (Ph.D.) degree in Technological Sciences. He served as governor (Hakim) of Jizzakh Region from 1996 to September 2001, then as governor of Samarqand Region from September 2001 until his appointment as prime minister in 2003. He was nominated as prime minister by President Islam Karimov on 12 December 2003, and approved by the Uzbek parliament. He replaced Prime Minister O ªtkir Sultonov. His deputy was Ergash Shoismatov. Mirziyoyev and Han Myeong-sook, the Prime Minister of South Korea, met in Tashkent on 25 September 2006. They signed several agreements, including one deal in which Uzbekistan will send 300 tons of Uzbek uranium ore to South Korea every year from 2010 to 2014. The deal bypasses U.S. companies that acted previously as middlemen for South Korean imports of Uzbek uranium ore. Han also met with President Islam Karimov and parliament speaker Erkin Xalilov. Han and Mirziyoyev boosted cooperation in the energy, agriculture, construction, architecture, and information technology sectors. Trade between South Korea and Uzbekistan increased by nearly 40% between 2005 and 2006, to $565 million. According to a 2017 report by Human Rights Watch on forced and child labour in the cotton sector of Uzbekistan, during his time as prime minister from 2003 to 2016 Mirziyoyev \\"oversaw the cotton production system, and as the previous governor of Jizzakh and Samarkand, he was in charge of two cotton-producing regions.

Mirziyoyev was reported to have friendly relations with Karimov's wife, Tatyana Karimova, and National Security Council chairman Rustam Inoyatov. After the death of Karimov was announced on 2 September 2016, Mirziyoyev was appointed as head of the committee organizing the funeral of the President. That was taken as a sign that Mirziyoyev would succeed Karimov as president. On 8 September 2016, he was appointed as interim president of Uzbekistan by a joint session of both houses of parliament. Although the chairman of the Senate, Nigmatilla Yuldashev, was constitutionally designated as Karimov's successor, Yuldashev proposed that Mirziyoyev take the post of interim president instead in light of Mirziyoyev's \\"many years of experience\\". There were expectations that Mirziyoyev would repair Uzbek relations with Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan. He started to settle a long-running border dispute with Kyrgyzstan, and regular flights between the capitals of Uzbekistan and Tajikistan were set to resume in January 2017 for the first time since 1992. The electoral commission announced on 16 September that Mirziyoyev would stand in the December 2016 presidential election as the candidate of the Liberal Democratic Party.\\"Uzbekistan's acting president to run in December election\\", Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, 16 September 2016. Mirziyoyev won the election, held on 4 December 2016, with 88.6% of the vote according to official results, defeating three minor candidates. The election was described by The Economist as a sham; the paper wrote that Mirziyoyev's bent was as authoritarian as that of Karimov and that state media claimed the choice was between Mirziyoyev, chaos, or Islamic radicalism. It also claimed that the three opponents were only on the ballot to keep up the appearance of pluralism. The Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe said the election lacked \\"a genuine choice,\\" pointing to instances of ballot box stuffing and proxy voting. On 12 December 2016, Deputy Prime Minister Abdulla Aripov was nominated to take over from Mirziyoyev as prime minister.\\"Uzbek party nominates deputy cabinet head Aripov for PM\\", Reuters, 12 December 2016. Mirziyoyev was sworn in as president on 14 December, vowing to \\"continue the work of my dear teacher, the great statesman Islam Karimov\\", while also promising \\"many changes in the cabinet\\". Aripov was confirmed as prime minister by parliament on the same day;\\"Uzbekistan's new leader promises major government reshuffle\\", Reuters, 14 December 2016. a cabinet reshuffle followed on 15 December.\\"Uzbekistan: Azimov loses job at Finance Ministry\\", Choihona, 15 December 2016. On 6 March 2017, he made a state visit to Turkmenistan; it was his first foreign trip after the election. In the three months following the death of Islam Karimov, Mirziyoyev began to hint at reforms to longstanding policies that had held back the Uzbek economy and isolated the country internationally, so many analysts believed that Mirziyoyev would be a better president than his predecessor. However, the Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development noted that \\"The people of Uzbekistan play no part in political decision-making processes. So far, no parliamentary or presidential election held in the post-Soviet era has been considered as either free or fair by the international community... Given the sensitive political situation in Uzbekistan, development cooperation activities there are implemented as far away from government circles as possible.\\" However, the positive results of his rule are visible. Uzbekistan created more than 336,000 new jobs in 2017. The volume of exports increased by almost 15 percent. In 2018, the total financial indicator of exports is expected at 12.1 billion US dollars. He initiated the project of \\"Tashkent City\\", intended to attract foreign investors to Uzbekistan. Mirziyoyev promised to resume negotiations with the World Trade Organization (WTO) on joining the organization in 2018. On several occasions, he sharply criticized the administration and officials in the presence of media. On 22 December, the first time in the country's history, Shavkat Mirziyoyev made an appeal to the parliament. His speech lasted for four hours. He said: U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo meets with the President of Uzbekistan Shavkat Mirziyoyev, at the Department of State in Washington, D.C., on 17 May 2018. Some analysts think Mirziyoyev wants to enter in history as a reformer. He removed most of Karimov's officials and urged government to employ \\"new, young people who love their country.\\" After a year of in office, Mirziyoyev is increasingly moving away from his predecessor's policy, which is especially visibly in his active foreign policy. He visited all the Uzbek regions and big cities to get acquainted with the implementation of the projects and reforms which he had ordered. Many analysts and Western media compared his rule with Chinese Deng Xiaoping or Russian Mikhail Gorbachev; his rule has been quoted as being an \\"Uzbek Spring\\".Uzbekistan‚Äôs Mirziyoyev Is Undoing Karimov‚Äôs Legacy, And It‚Äôs About Timehttps://amp.washingtontimes.com/news/2018/jul/22/why-america-must-welcome- the-uzbek-spring/ In May 2018, Mirziyoyev was nominated as a candidate for the Nobel Peace Prize by Olimzhon Tukhtanazarov, who is a representative of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party. By the end of that year, he had been named the \\"Asian of the Year of 2018\\" by the Asia Journalist Association (AJA). In August 2019 he closed the notorious Jaslyk Prison. =Foreign policy= Mirziyoyev's foreign policy is much more open than the policy of his predecessor. Uzbekistan was practically under international isolation after the Andijan massacre in 2005 and Karimov rarely travelled outside of Central Asia and other CIS states. Mirziyoyev promised to conduct an active foreign policy at the beginning of his tenure. During the first 10 months, Mirziyoyev visited Kazakhstan four times, Turkmenistan three times, Russia two times, as well as China, Saudi Arabia, United States, Turkey and Kyrgyzstan. At the different occasions, he met the presidents of Iran, Azerbaijan, Afghanistan, Tajikistan, Bulgaria, Belarus and the King of Spain. During the CIS Summit in Tashkent in November 2017, he met 8 Prime Ministers of foreign countries. One of his most significant foreign policy achievements is the gradual improvement of relations with Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan. On 5 September, just 3 days after the anniversary of the death of his predecessor, he made a historic visit to Kyrgyzstan. That was the first state visit of an Uzbek President to this neighboring country since 2000. On 19 September, he addressed the UN General Assembly for the first time. In 2018, a large number of foreign leaders visited and or are expected in Uzbekistan, including Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoƒüan, as well as Belarussian leader Alexander Lukashenko whose visit took place in September and was his first state visit to the country in 24 years. In March 2018, he made a visit to Tajikistan, which made him the first Uzbek president to conduct a state visit to Dushanbe since 2000.–®–∞–≤–∫–∞—Ç –ú–∏—Ä–∑–∏—ë–µ–≤ –ø–æ—Å–µ—Ç–∏—Ç –¢–∞–¥–∂–∏–∫–∏—Å—Ç–∞–Ω —Å –≤–∏–∑–∏—Ç–æ–º Mirziyoyev has also taken an important role in Afghanistan by offering to host peace talks between the government and the Taliban since March 2018.

In March 2019, Mirziyoyev held a telephone conversation with Nursultan Nazarbayev, who had resigned from office that day. In it, he expressed regret to the ex-president, saying that he was a \\"great politician\\".https://president.uz/en/lists/view/2438https://www.inform.kz/en/shavkat- mirziyoyev-nursultan-nazarbayev-is-a-great-politician_a3509084 During a visit to Abu Dhabi in March 2019, Mirziyoyev came away from his talks with Crown Prince Mohammed bin Zayed over 10 billion dollars in infrastructure, alternative energy and agriculture deals, as well as deals in other spheres.http://vestnikkavkaza.net/articles/Mirziyoyev-comes-away-from-UAE- visit-with-multibillion-dollar-promises.html Personal life His father, Miromon Mirziyoyev, worked as a physician for most of his life until death. He worked as the head physician of the tuberculosis dispensary in Zaamin. He also has two sisters, a half-brother, and sister. Mirziyoyev is married to Ziroatkhon Hoshimova and has two daughters, a son and five grandchildren.

He was known as Lord Hervey from 1723, upon the death of his elder half-brother, Carr, the only son of his father's first wife, Isabella, but Lord Hervey never became Earl of Bristol, as he predeceased his father. Life Hervey was educated at Westminster School and at Clare College, Cambridge, where he took his M.A. degree in 1715. His father then sent him to Paris in 1716, and thence to Hanover to pay court to George I. He was a frequent visitor at the court of the Prince and Princess of Wales at Richmond, and in 1720 he married Mary Lepell, daughter of Nicholas Lepell, who was one of the Princess's ladies-in- waiting, and a great court beauty. In 1723 John's elder half-brother Carr died, whereby he became heir apparent to the Earldom of Bristol with the courtesy title of Lord Hervey. In 1725 he was elected M.P. for Bury St Edmunds. Hervey had been at one time on very friendly terms with Frederick, Prince of Wales, but in about 1732 they quarrelled, apparently because they were rivals for the affection of Anne Vane. These differences probably account for the scathing picture he draws of the Prince's callous conduct. Hervey had been hesitating between William Pulteney (afterwards earl of Bath) and Robert Walpole, but in 1730 he definitely took sides with Walpole, of whom he was thenceforward a faithful adherent. He was assumed by Pulteney to be the author of Sedition and Defamation display'd, with a Dedication to the patrons of The Craftsman (1731). Pulteney, who, up to this time, had been a firm friend of Hervey, replied with A Proper Reply to a late Scurrilous Libel, and the quarrel resulted in a duel from which Hervey narrowly escaped with his life. Hervey is said to have denied the authorship of both the pamphlet and its dedication, but a note on the manuscript at Ickworth, apparently in his own hand, states that he wrote the latter. He was able to render valuable service to Walpole from his influence with the Queen. Through him the minister governed Queen Caroline and indirectly George II. Hervey was vice-chamberlain in the royal household and a member of the Privy Council. In 1733 he was called to the House of Lords by writ of acceleration in his father's Barony. He was then elected a governor of the Foundling Hospital prior to its foundation in 1739.R.H. Nichols and F A. Wray, The History of the Foundling Hospital (London: Oxford University Press, 1935) In spite of repeated requests he received no further preferment until after 1740, when he became Lord Privy Seal. After the fall of Sir Robert Walpole he was dismissed (July 1742) from his office. An excellent political pamphlet, Miscellaneous Thoughts on the present Posture of Foreign and Domestic Affairs, shows that he still retained his mental vigour, but he was liable to epilepsy, and his weak appearance and rigid diet were a constant source of ridicule for his enemies. He predeceased his father, but three of his sons became successively Earls of Bristol. Memoirs and literary quarrels Hervey wrote detailed and brutally frank memoirs of the court of George II from 1727 to 1737. He gave a most unflattering account of the King, and of Frederick, Prince of Wales, and their family squabbles. For the Queen and her daughter, Princess Caroline, he had a genuine respect and attachment, and the Princess's affection for him was commonly said to be the reason for the close retirement in which she lived after his death. The manuscript of Hervey's memoirs was preserved by the family, but his son, Augustus John, 3rd Earl of Bristol, left strict injunctions that they should not be published until after the death of George III. In 1848 they were published under the editorship of J. W. Croker, but the manuscript had been subjected to a certain amount of mutilation before it came into his hands. Croker also softened in some cases the plainspokenness of the original. Hervey's account of court life and intrigues resembles in many points the memoirs of Horace Walpole, and the two books corroborate one another in many statements that might otherwise have been received with suspicion. Until the publication of the Memoirs Hervey was chiefly known as the object of savage satire on the part of Alexander Pope, in whose works he figured as Lord Fanny, Sporus, Adonis and Narcissus. The quarrel is generally put down to Pope's jealousy of Hervey's friendship with Lady Mary Wortley Montagu. In the first of the Imitations of Horace, addressed to William Fortescue, Lord Fanny and Sappho were generally identified with Hervey and Lady Mary, although Pope denied the personal intention. Hervey had already been attacked in the Dunciad and the Peribathous, and he now retaliated. There is no doubt that he had a share in the Verses to the Imitator of Horace (1732) and it is possible that he was the sole author. In the Letter from a nobleman at Hampton Court to a Doctor of Divinity (1733), he scoffed at Pope's deformity and humble birth. Pope's reply was a Letter to a Noble Lord, dated November 1733, and the portrait of Sporus in the Epistle to Dr Arbuthnot (1743), which forms the prologue to the satires. Many of the insinuations and insults contained in it are borrowed from Pulteney's A Proper Reply to a late Scurrilous Libel. Some literary critics, such as Martin C. Battestin,Battestin, Martin C. \\"General Introduction\\" in Henry Fielding, Joseph Andrews. Middleton, Connecticut: Wesleyan University Press, 1967. suggest that Pope's friend and fellow-satirist Henry Fielding intended the character of Beau Didapper in Joseph Andrews to be read as Hervey. Beau Didapper is described as obedient to the commands of a \\"Great Man\\" (presumably Walpole) \\"which he implicitly submitted to, at the Expence of his Conscience, his Honour, and of his Country.\\" Didapper is also compared to Hylas, and is mistaken for a woman in the dark on account of his soft skin. The malicious caricature of Sporus does Hervey great injustice, and he is not much better treated by Horace Walpole, who in reporting his death in a letter (14 August 1743) to Horace Mann, said he had outlived his last inch of character. Nevertheless, his writings prove him to have been a man of real ability, condemned by Walpole's tactics and distrust of able men to spend his life in court intrigue, the weapons of which, it must be owned, he used with the utmost adroitness. His wife Lady Hervey (1700‚Äì1768), of whom an account is to be found in Lady Louisa Stuart's Anecdotes, was a warm partisan of the Stuarts. She retained her wit and charm throughout her life, and has the distinction of being the recipient of English verses by Voltaire. Marriages, affairs, and sexuality Hervey married Mary Lepell (1700‚Äì1768) on 21 April 1720. They had eight children: 1\\\\. The Hon. Mary Hervey (c. 1720‚Äì ), married 1745 George FitzGerald, of Turlough, County Mayo, and was the mother of the notoriously eccentric duellist George Robert FitzGerald. 2\\\\.

Caroline Hervey (1736‚Äì1819), unmarried Hervey was bisexual.Lucy Moore, Amphibious Thing: the Life of Lord Hervey (Viking, 2000) He had an affair with Anne Vane, and possibly with Lady Mary Wortley Montagu and Princess Caroline. He lived with Stephen Fox often during the decade after he followed him to Italy in 1728. He wrote passionate love letters to Francesco Algarotti, whom he first met in 1736. He may have had a sexual affair with Prince Frederick before their friendship dissolved. He was in fact denounced as a sexually ambiguous figure in his time most notably by William Pulteney, then leader of the Opposition and as cited above, by Alexander Pope in his \\"Sporus\\" portrait: \\"Let Sporus tremble/What that thing of silk...His wit all seesaw between that and this/Now high, now low, now master up, now miss/And he himself one vile antithesis...\\".

The general election took place in 40 parliamentary constituencies throughout Ireland for 147 seats in the lower house of parliament, D√°il √âireann. Campaign The general election of 1951 was caused by a number of crises within the First Inter-Party Government, most notably the Mother and Child Scheme. While the whole affair ‚Äì which saw the resignation of the Minister for Health, Noel Browne ‚Äì was not entirely to blame for the collapse of the government, it added to the disagreement between the various political parties. There were other problems facing the country, such as rising prices and balance-of-payments problems. Two farmer TDs withdrew their support for the government because of rising milk prices. Although the First Inter-Party Government was now coming to an end, it had a number of achievements. It proved that the country could be led by a group other than Fianna F√°il. It also provided a fresh perspective after sixteen years of unbroken rule by that party. The coalition parties fought the general election on their record on government over the previous three years, while Fianna F√°il argued strongly against coalition governments.

Cassin was born in Upper Providence Township, Delaware County, Pennsylvania near Philadelphia on September 6, 1813. Though his ancestors were Quakers, several had distinguished themselves in military and naval service. left A careful and talented taxonomist, Cassin named 198 birds not described in the works of his predecessors Alexander Wilson and John James Audubon. He is commemorated himself in the names of a number of birds from western North America, including the Cassin's auklet, Cassin's kingbird, Cassin's vireo, Cassin's sparrow, and Cassin's finch. He was commemorated by other naturalists as well. Samuel Washington Woodhouse, for example, named Cassin's Sparrow (Peucaea cassinii) for John Cassin. The periodic cicada Magicicada cassini is also named for him. Cassin drew, engraved, and colored many of the illustrations published in the Pacific Railroad Surveys. Cassin's Kingbird Named curator of the Philadelphia Academy of Natural Sciences in 1842, Cassin described many new bird species and revised a number of families in the Academy's publications. His more extensive publications include Birds of California, with descriptions and colored engravings of fifty species not given by Audubon; Synopsis of the Birds of North America; Ornithology of the United States Exploring Expedition; Ornithology of the Japan Expedition; Ornithology of Gillis's Astronomical Expedition to Chile; and chapters on raptorial birds and waders in Ornithology of the Pacific Railroad Explorations and Surveys.

Function  NSF is a homohexameric AAA ATPase involved in membrane fusion. NSF is ubiquitously found in the membrane of eukaryotic cells. It is a central component of the cellular machinery in the transfer of membrane vesicles from one membrane compartment to another. During this process, SNARE proteins on two joining membranes (usually a vesicle and a target membrane such as the plasma membrane) form a complex, with the Œ±-helical domains of the SNAREs coiling around each other and forming a very stable four-helix bundle. As SNAREs intertwine, they pull the vesicle towards the target membrane, excluding water and promoting fusion of the vesicle with the target membrane. NSF unravels SNARE complexes once membrane fusion has occurred, using the hydrolysis of ATP as an energy source, allowing the dissociated SNAREs to be recycled for reuse in further rounds of membrane fusion. This proposal remains controversial, however. Recent work indicates that the ATPase function of NSF does not function in recycling of vesicles but rather functions in the act of fusing vesicles with the plasma membrane.  SNARE hypothesis  Because neuronal function depends on the release of neurotransmitters at a synapse ‚Äî a process in which synaptic vesicles fuse with the presynaptic membrane ‚Äî NSF is a key synaptic component. Thus, conditional temperature-sensitive mutations in the Drosophila melanogaster gene for NSF lead to a comatose behaviour at the restrictive temperature (and hence the gene is called comatose), presumably because neuronal functions are blocked. In Dictyostelium discoideum amoebae, similar mutations lead to a cessation of cell movement at the restrictive temperature, indicating a role for intracellular membrane transport in migration. Another neuronal role for NSF is indicated by its direct binding to the GluR2 subunit of AMPA type glutamate receptors (which detect the neurotransmitter glutamate). This gives NSF a putative role in delivery and expression of AMPA receptors at the synapse. NSF was discovered by James Rothman and colleagues in 1987 while at Stanford University; they identified NSF after observing that a cytoplasmic factor, required for membrane fusions, was inactivated by treatment with N-ethylmaleimide. This assay enabled them to purify NSF.  Interactions  N-ethylmaleimide sensitive fusion protein has been shown to interact with NAPA.

He was a government minister under Joseph Lyons and Robert Menzies, leader of the Country Party from 1939 to 1940, and finally Speaker of the House of Representatives from 1950 until his death. Cameron was born in Happy Valley, South Australia. After serving in World War I, he became took up a farm near Loxton as a soldier settler. He was elected to the South Australian House of Assembly in 1927, and to the House of Representatives at the 1934 federal election. Cameron was Postmaster-General in the Lyons Government from 1938 to 1939. He replaced Earle Page as leader of the Country Party in September 1939, and in March 1940 led the party back into coalition with the United Australia Party (UAP), which Page had broken off. Cameron was de facto deputy prime minister under Menzies, as well as Minister for Commerce and Minister for the Navy. However, he was deposed as Country Party leader in October 1940, subsequently defecting to the UAP (and later joining the new Liberal Party). Cameron's last appointment was as Speaker, where he was highly respected. He was known throughout his political career for his eccentric manner and strong personality. Early life Cameron was born in Happy Valley, South Australia, the son of Mary Ann (n√©e McDonald) and John Cameron. His parents were both immigrants from Scotland. He was educated at state schools and worked on his father's farm at Happy Valley until 1916, when he joined the First Australian Imperial Force and fought on the Western Front. He was gassed while in the front, suffering severe damage to his heart and lungs. After World War I Cameron took up farming near Loxton as part of a soldier settlement scheme, and became active in the newly formed Country Party. State politics In 1927, Cameron was elected to the seat of Wooroora in the South Australian House of Assembly, and became leader of the state branch of the Country Party. He helped shepherd the merger of the SA Country Party with the Liberal Federation to form the Liberal and Country League. As part of the deal, in 1934 he was elected to the House of Representatives for Barker, a mostly conservative seat stretching from rural southeastern South Australia to the outer suburbs of Adelaide. Federal politics Cameron did not have long to wait for ministerial preferment; in 1937 he was appointed an assistant minister in the government of Joseph Lyons. In November 1937, Cameron stood for the deputy leadership of the Country Party following the retirement of Thomas Paterson; he did not win enough votes to make the second ballot. He briefly served as acting minister for commerce in 1938, and during that time became the first minister to be \\"named\\" by the Speaker. Later that year, he became Postmaster-General. He temporarily suspended radio 2KY's licence because he objected to political views expressed on it (2KY was the property of the ALP's New South Wales branch). =Leader of the Country Party= Cameron as Country Party leader Cameron was elected leader of the Country Party on 13 September 1939, following the resignation of Earle Page. He defeated John McEwen by seven votes to five, with two abstentions. According to McEwen, the result was skewed by the absence of four MPs who had refused to sit with the Country Party with Page as leader ‚Äì a motion to re-admit them was defeated by seven votes to six. McEwen claimed in his memoirs that the dissident MPs were \\"all strong supporters of mine and, had they been allowed to vote, I would have won the election\\". They were all re-admitted to the party a few months later. In March 1940, Cameron took the Country Party back into the coalition government under Menzies, becoming the de facto deputy prime minister as well as Minister for Commerce and Minister for the Navy. After the 1940 election, however, the Country Party tired of Cameron's domineering style, and replaced him as leader with Arthur Fadden. Cameron then immediately resigned from the ministry, and from the Country Party: he joined Menzies's party, the United Australia Party. He rejoined the Army and spent the rest of the war on active service in the Directorate of Military Intelligence at Army Headquarters, Melbourne, where he did useful work on the Japanese order of battle. While he was in the service, he faced what would be his only really close electoral contest. At the 1943 election, trade unionist Harry Krantz slashed Cameron's majority from a comfortably safe 15.9 percent to an extremely marginal 1.7 percent. Cameron was left as the only non-Labor MP from South Australia, and the only non-Labor member outside the eastern states (the member for Northern Territory Adair Blain was an independent, but did not have full voting rights). =Speaker of the House of Representatives= Cameron followed most of the UAP into Menzies's new party, the Liberal Party, and when the Liberals won the 1949 elections Menzies appointed him Speaker of the House: mainly, it was said, to keep him out of the Cabinet. He presided over the House with an autocratic style that caused a number of celebrated rows with members on both sides. Cameron's health never recovered from his World War I gassing, and in August 1955 he contracted influenza. Despite this, he fought that year's election and was handily reelected. He would die of a heart attack in August in Royal Prince Alfred Hospital, Sydney. Personal life Cameron married Margaret Eileen Walsh on 15 April 1925. They had a son and a daughter together; his daughter predeceased him. Cameron was raised Presbyterian, but later converted to Catholicism, which was his wife's religion. He was known for choosing to affirm (rather than swear) the oath of office, citing Jesus's admonition to \\"swear not at all\\".Oaths and affirmations made by the executive and members of federal parliament since 1901, Parliament of Australia.
